" WICKED WITCH
",-0.7096,-0.3902,2021-03-13 00:00:00,7,"I was speechless watching the ending. From the first parts of the movie, there were many cute, relationship scenes between a Father-Son and a couple. The autopsy was literally crucial since Jane's anatomy has some weird & obscure organs that totally doesn't get any sense at all. Apparently, she died and left a clueless note. There were no external evidences like bruises, scars, wounds and etc. She died with the body of a clean one. But yet how did she die? The movie totally makes you ride in a rollercoaster that its concept is totally cool and unique. The thing about the main characters? I pity them all so much I didn't even see Jane Doe move physically from her examined-body 'cause it'll be cool for a jumpscare. All I love about the movie is its concept of anatomy and autopsy but the plot was slightly disturbing."
" The first 45 minutes are great...the rest, not so much
",0.0,-0.999,2021-03-12 00:00:00,6,"Sometimes a movie viewing experience could end up being more frustrating, if the film in question actually starts quite promising and offers (at least partly) an original idea, but loses focus along the way and becomes just another example of exhausted genre-formulas, erasing any initial positive impressions, than if one is watching just a flat out disastrously bad film. ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" had the potential to be a great supernatural horror film, alas, its' intriguing story was sacrificed for cheap jump scares, illogical plot progressions and a senseless shock value-ending, which doesn't resolve anything, doesn't feel particularly earned in a dramatic way and makes the whole journey, in retrospect, worthless.The opening is creepy and instantly engaging - police officers and crime scene specialists are walking through a house, where multiple victims of a homicide have been found. One of them is the strangely well-preserved body of a young unidentified female, with no obvious external signs of injury or trauma and this is the only victim located in the basement of the house. The police officers at the scene are at a loss to explain how the visibly untouched body of Jane Doe in the basement is connected to the brutal murders of the family members upstairs. Then one of the officers makes a chilly remark about the crime scene and victims: ""Doesn't look like someone broke in. To me it looks like they were trying to break out"". And that's how it's done - only 4 minutes in and my interest is piqued, because there is a promise of a mystery and a threat. And it gets better...at least for a while, before it all comes crashing down.We are introduced to our two protagonists - experienced coroner Tommy Tilden (played by the great Brian Cox) and his son and work-assistant Austin Tilden (Emile Hirsch) and we get to see them in their place of ""business"" - the morgue - doing their stomach-churning (for the regular person) work routines of photographing and cutting open corpses, inspecting and measuring organs, discussing clues and theories for cause of death, etc., all while we are treated to a happy adrenaline-pumping tune as a companion background soundtrack, an idea I found strangely disturbing and satisfying at the same time. It brings a smile to one's face, when clearly one is not supposed to smile at that particular moment. Look at how cheerful and pleasant the job of a coroner is! - screams the soundtrack, and yes, the way the scene is portrayed is darkly humorous.We get quickly attached to our two main characters, as the dialogue exchanges between them establish early on a relationship between father and son, which is grounded in mutual love and respect. Tommy is teaching his son the tools of the trade and offering in depth observations and recommendations of how to excel at the profession, while still not forgetting to offer words of encouragement to him, when he somewhat impatiently hurries to incorrectly interpret a cause of death for a body: ""You did good. You'll get there."" At the same time, he is respectful of his son's private life and is happy to see him in the company of his vibrant and beautiful girlfriend Emma (played by the lovely Ophelia Lovibond) when she does a surprise visit at the morgue to pick up Austin earlier for their date. Austin in turn, although visibly delighted to see his romantic interest, has such a sense of respect and obligation to his father, that he volunteers to stay longer and assist him in a late-night autopsy, when the mysterious body of Jane Doe is brought in at the last minute before the morgue is closed for the night. The sheriff, who delivers the body, insists that the autopsy cannot wait until next morning.As father and son proceed with the autopsy, things get progressively weirder and creepier - they find out the victim's tongue has been crudely cut off, internal organs badly scarred and burned, wrists and ancles fractured (curiously with no external materialization of the trauma), and most puzzling of all, a cryptic parchment with symbols is found undigested in her stomach. Parallel to their findings, their surroundings start to grow particularly frightening as well - the radio in the room starts changing stations on its own and playing eerie songs, strange sounds and apparitions are manifesting and outside an unforeseen powerful storm is developing. And exactly at the middle, around the 45-minute mark, when I was fully engaged by the gripping mystery, things start going downhill and fast.In the middle of the autopsy (and the unveiling of the mystery), there is a blackout in the building and then jump scares start flooding the screen, we get the frightening sound from the air condition shaft which turns out to be the home cat, we witness scary monsters which turn out to be hallucinations, we see illogical character decisions (""You want to go back in there?""), a needless ""shock-value"" accident-death of a character (spoilers: the girlfriend is killed, and in a very dumb way, and by our own ""heroes"", get this: by mistake) and we arrive at an ending so jarringly dismal and undeservedly depressing, that it undermines all the superb work presented in the first half.I can almost swallow all the overused horror tropes, that I just mentioned, if the ending was not a total intellectual affront. What do I mean? Well, let's get into more specifics...and spoilers. It quickly becomes clear that the mysterious Jane Doe is causing the supernatural events at the morgue and her evil powers are so vast, that she can thwart any attempt by Tommy and Austin to escape the building, but for some strange reason she does not hurry to kill them: ""Well, look what she can do. If she wanted us dead..."" - Tommy muses on Jane Doe's motives. Great, I thought, so there must be some otherworldly message that Jane Doe is trying to convey to our characters, some secret of maybe how, why and by whom she was killed. The writers try to twist the formula a bit with the following line: ""It's like there is something she doesn't want us to find"", and it doesn't make much sense (because if it was true, then why are both characters still alive, if Jane Doe has such frightening powers?), but I decide to go along. Then the writers proceed to dig themselves deeper in the dirt with: ""If we stay here, we're dead. If we can just figure out how she died, maybe we can figure out how to stop her."" Oh, ok, so Tommy and Austin have to go back to the autopsy room and finish what they started, find out how Jane Doe died and then all will be fine, right? Well, guess what suckers, they do find out Jane Doe's big secret (this one I won't spoil), but then realize this is their biggest mistake. Now Jane can come after them, hard. Shortly before Tommy is killed, he begs Jane to have mercy and spare the life of his son. For a bit, it looks like it works, as Austin goes in the direction of the building's exit and hears the police outside the blocked doors, trying to get in. But you know what, Austin has to die too, so, startled by an apparition, he falls down to his death, and that's that. So, what was the point of the whole thing, I ask? If they stay in the same place, they die. If they try to escape (which they did, but Jane would not let them), ultimately, they will die. If they figure out the secret, they die. If they don't figure out the secret, they die. It doesn't really matter, does it? But wait, the scriptwriters retort - didn't you read the part where the characters discover, that Jane Doe just wants to punish people and exact vengeance by making innocent people experience the pain, that she has been put through? Oh, wow. So, it's basically just a curse thing. A ""Grudge"" thing. Whoever comes in contact with Jane Doe has to die, regardless. How very original.And the final shot of the film, inside the back of the ambulance vehicle transporting Jane Doe's body, which shows her moving her toe, to indicate she is still alive and menacing, is so ridiculously dumb, one feels obliged to throw the expired foods from the fridge at the screen.What a wasted potential.And by the way, talking about wasted potential, why were the talents of Olivia Lovibond wasted? Her total screen time cannot have exceeded 5 minutes and the movie would have worked just fine without her character. If you are going to cast her (she is a great actress!), then do write some interesting character arc for her, give her a more substantial and sensible role. The way her character was written and not allowed to develop - why was she needed at all? Oh, that's right - they needed another dead body halfway through, to make things more dynamic..."
" Oh yes!!!!! What a great horror film. .
",0.3753,0.9447,2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,"In my opinion this is up there with The Thing and American Werewolf in London as the best horror films I've ever seen, it's really well made with great acting from all, especially Jane Doe, she was flawless.
It's very hard for a film to creep me out but this genuinely made me go cold and made the hair stand up all over me.I definitely recommend it but please don't watch it alone or at night.

Brian Cox kicking butt :).AOJD is a nice piece of supernatural/horror that holds your interest right through the movie. As I was watching it I was afraid at the half way point the film would slowly spoil itself as it tried to create a good ending. It didn't. Some may not like the ending, others will but it was good enough not to be a disappointment.This movie has about 5 people in it so strong performances were required to hold the story and the audience together and they did.Totally recommend this movie :)"
" The Autopsy of Jane Doe
",0.0,-0.4771,2021-01-07 00:00:00,6,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe has a lot going for it. In general it's better than most modern horror movies. But that is a very low bar to hop over.For one, the movie has Brian Cox, who is great in everything. He's honestly one of the most underrated working actors. His performance here as a hard-working expert in the human anatomy and a logical thinker is compelling. The latter descriptor is especially interesting as he struggles more and more to come to scientific conclusions for his findings. The way the movie builds suspense through nothing more than grotesque body horror and scientific impossibilities is impressive. It almost feels Lovecraftian how the questions about Jane Doe's injuries stack on top of one another until the big climax. And the climax is intense.But once the movie reaches this point it becomes more predictable. It goes from procedural horror to action horror. It's a shame because it was doing some very original things in the first half. It just couldn't keep the same momentum throughout."

I do enjoy the fantasy but certain elements live in my imagination for a while, sometimes losing sleep for a day or two. On this note, this is one of the best horror movies I have ever watched.

",0.0,-0.6296,2021-01-01 00:00:00,9,"This was such a good movie premise, from the start i had all kinds of ideas running through my head on who was jane doe. As each layer got revealed and the puzzle started to take shape, i was frantically trying to put the pieces of her identity together. I will also admit till halfway through the film i felt sorrow for her. Man this movie is pretty graphic but in a realistic autopsy way. Like you wont see this on CSI. It shook me in that way when you learn some terrible secret you cant unlearn, like what happens to us, our bodies when we die, ughh. That made this all the more horrifying.I think the skin crawl factor of this movie is pretty high when you think about this is what happens to us when we die. Anyway on the supernatural side of things, yeah damn creepy, i went right into little girl mode and was half covering my eyes for some parts, peeking through my fingers lol.Its a really good movie, the only thing that kind of mad me sad was the way it ended. I get they want a possible sequel, but i really think they should have done the ending a little different and made the movie a one off. Fantastic storyline and not something that should be relegated to a bunch of sequels, ala jane doe part 5. But dont miss this movie , unless you are really squeamish, or faint of heart, the story is a great one not really seen before."
" Creepy and Original Horror Movie, At Least to this Non-Aficionado of the Genre
",-0.34,-0.6173,2020-12-24 00:00:00,8,"A couple of things I should mention right off the bat. I watch horror movies from time to time, but it's not my world or ""my thing"". I'm a long way from being an expert on the genre and probably don't recognize what is or isn't original. With that said, this film seemed pretty original to me.Second, I'm a middle-aged white male, and while I'm fit and trim, I'm more beta than alpha. Perhaps that's why I just didn't get the negative remarks about this film being misogynistic. In the vast bulk of the horror movies I've seen, the ""evil"" character was male and nobody's complaining. In this more ambiguous film, I'm supposed to see some anti-female tirade that objectifies women because it's plotted around the mysterious corpse of a young and beautiful woman. If these scenes of a naked woman really upset someone so much, then I'd suggest they don't do too much exploring with Google. Frankly, I didn't find them titillating in the least (it's an autopsy and I'm not a necrophilliac) and if someone is seeing so much extra meaning (micro-aggressions?) in this film, that probably says more about them than anyone else.With that said, this movie very effectively builds suspense and creepiness and held my attention all the way to the end. Many reviewers found the last third a let-down, but then I'm getting the feeling that they're likely much more into the horror movies than I am, because I didn't feel that it was predictable; however, like I said, this may only reflect my ignorance.So, in the end, I'll have to give ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" a qualified thumbs up. If you only dip into horror from time to time, this may interest you, but, perhaps, if you're an old horror hand, maybe there's not that much new to you here. I really don't know."

" Toxic femininity through biased Scandinavian lens
",-0.2732,-0.4737,2020-12-02 00:00:00,6,"In Scandinavia, they granted their females equality early, and their protestant moralizing has been persistent, if subdued, ever since - which is reflected in this movie. Nothing too substantial, more of a skin-deep kind, and you do get a lot of style, and nice cinematography and tastefully restrained scares to somewhat hide how silly and hole filled the revenge-of-a-witch plot really is. This is no Shining, that you can count on, it does not come close even to The VVitch, it is a more shallow affair. As the witch body is being transferred in the parting scene, in reality, toxic femininity is being exported from Scandinavia to the United States to the rest of the world, causing unspeakable mayhem, just as by the end of the movie dead bodies pile up, and past injustices are used as an excuse for present day evil in a reversal of roles, just like late wave feminists would want it. While OK for a horror flick, the movie by the rustic and, frankly, quite overrated Norwegian filmmaker is just an eye candy (as witches usually are) while lacking intelligence and showing great void north of the eyebrows, but in the deep North, no one can hear your empty head ringing, nor catch your slower-than-thou wit."
" Short, but sweet.

",-0.5719,0.7171,2020-11-12 00:00:00,9,"The last time I jumped during a horror movie..... was so long ago I've forgotten!How I found this movie...I looked at the 100 scariest movies on IMDB to see if I have missed anything, and there it was.An excellent movie, well acted, very original idea, dark, creepy, unexpected twists and turns and as I said, I did actually jump out of my seat at one point.Unlike a few others I liked the ending, which in keeping with the rest of the movie was unexpected.A great find for any connoisseur of horror movies."
" Unimpressed
",-0.34,0.9471,2020-11-09 00:00:00,4,"Checked this out after having seen the cineastic gorgeousness of Possession of Hannah Grace, as people claimed they were similar. Except for title, I can't really see it. What I mostly see is a lot of men staring a lot at a naked female body, like we're stuck in the fifties. Done and done with that. The way she's filmed again and again return to her nudity and objectification. Could she be old, could it be a man, the way she's filmed? Nope. Here's another gross thing: ""André Øvredal said that Olwen Catherine Kelly had the most difficult role in the film, and he credited her with making everyone else comfortable on the set.""
So the naked girl has to make everyone else comfortable on set. NOPE.
On top of that, cinematography is unimpressive, pacing is off, use of scoring and music is just not working for me, characters are flat. Brian Cox is amazing, no surprise, but that's about it.
Instead I would recommend earlier mentioned Possession of Hannah Grace, The Haunting in Connecticut, The Uninvited, and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, if you like recent movies of skinny young people dealing with death/ghosts."
" An Effectively Creepy Film - For the First Half
",0.4404,0.9592,2020-11-02 00:00:00,6,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe, is directed by AndrÃ© Ãvredal and stars Brian Cox, Emile Hirsch and of course Olwen Catherine Kelly as the title character, Jane Doe. The film follows a father and son, who are both coroners, examining a mysterious corpse. The further they unravel, the more questions they have, leading to a sinister realization.Back in 2016 when the movie was originally released, it was met with fairly positive reception, yet none of the promotional material did anything to excite me, as it just came across to be yet another possession movie, with cheap jump-scares. However, such is not the case, at least for the first half.The Autopsy of Jane Doe, has an excellent opening, setting up intrigue for the audience; in fact, the first two acts are quite thrilling, with skillful use of suspense, that left me on the edge of my seat multiple times. Although none of the characters are all that interesting, with a husband who recently lost his wife and a son that wants to move away to pursue other opportunities; the main draw of the film consists of uncovering the truth behind a mysterious corpse alongside the characters, and in that respect, the film does a wonderful job at building a mystery. The movie is also very pleasing to look at, with sharp-looking cinematography coincided with a good colour gradient creating a gloomy atmosphere of blue and grey, allowing for light sources to really pop in some scenes. I can't neglect to mention that the SPX used in this film is pretty much seamless, particularly with the cadaver of Jane Doe. The practical effects used when the body is being examined is very well crafted, tricking you into thinking they trusted two actors to cut open an actual corpse. There is one scene in particular where a character peels back a scalp, and the process of using a practical effect of some sort on top of an actress, made the whole sequence flow so smoothly, and almost feel lifelike, the way the filmmakers were able to accomplish that little bit.Most of what makes this film work, is its suspense, and they were a couple of times throughout the first two acts that effectively creeped me out, it left me with a feeling that I haven't felt in a long time while watching a horror film. However that level of suspense, sadly, does not last, as the final 25-30 minutes, sort of gets a little ridiculous. It's not horrible by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a steep drop-off in quality in comparison to what the film was going for earlier. It came across like the filmmakers felt as if they had to abandon the suspenseful atmosphere in exchange for a vibe that would please more mainstream horror fans, with dumb jump scares and loud moments, that cumulates to a very boring third act. Although the ending is quite predictable, it doesn't take away from the fact that it is also very underwhelming, and doesn't feel like an effect payoff. This sort of severe dip in quality really detracted from my overall experience, and though as I mentioned, it is not the worst thing ever, it is still disappointing given the great opening and middle frame of this movie.
In closing, The Autopsy of Jane Doe, is an enjoyable movie during the first half, with effective scares that go above the status-quo of what is expected out of most horror movies released nowadays. However, the final third act doesn't maintain that same level of quality, rather dipping down and not differentiating itself from its competition. However the appealing cinematography and good SFX work help to elevate this movie from its woes, and clocking in at just under 90 minutes, makes this film an easy one to flip on and make it through with its brisk pace. I do recommend this film, but just keep in mind that it is most certainly not perfect, and for that reason, I am giving, The Autopsy of Jane Doe, a 6/10."
" Very, very good. Could have been great.
",0.8211,0.8261,2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Fantastic first half, pretty good second half. Great performances from Brian Cox, Emile Hirsch, and Olwen Kelly (who does an amazing job - seriously - as the corpse). The first half builds a great sense of dread and foreboding. Sadly, the second half loses that a bit. There are plenty of 'WTF??' moments and some good scares, but it just runs out of steam a little. A real shame. Still a 7.5/10, but if the second half had measured up to the first it would have been an easy 9."
" A Coroner's Worst Nightmare Unveiled
",-0.6249,-0.9198,2020-10-31 00:00:00,8,"I am a lover of binge watching horror movies, seeing both fantastic bone-chilling ones as well as horrendous ones. Plus, one of my favorite hobbies is to study classic horror film techniques such as the dutch tilt and the long-hallway shot. The Autopsy of Jane Doe had a decent storyline that was easy to follow as well as kept drawing in the viewer as the time went on. Using suspense, psychological confusion, scene effects, and musical stings to add tension and truly have the viewer's skin crawl, the movie is a great one to watch if you are a fellow horror movie enthusiast. The movie had me feeling very uncomfortable and on edge. Plus at some points, just like a cat when startled, the hairs on my body all stood up at once, truly giving me the chills. Especially whenever the haunting face of Jane Doe is shown. The face stays with you through your nightmares. There were many good aspects of the movie such as the foreshadowing which set up the story well, the medical accuracy along with the makeup, and the character background with the character development of the protagonists decreasing mental states. Were there a lot of horror film cliches in this movie? Yes, there were but they were unique to the film. There were many musical tension scares that were well placed as well as they were not over used. In addition, there was the classic long hallway shot that was used throughout the film but instead of a straight shot it was a mirror reflected shot that added even more suspense to the scene. Just as well, there could have been more practicality with the number of jump cuts. It seemed really unnecessary to have a jump cut every 2 seconds for some scenes. But those are minor changes. Overall the movie was a great watch for a late night scare and truly came from the worst nightmare of coroners. The body is not just a body, she is an angry spirit out for revenge on anyone who hurts her and truly strikes fear into anyone who is close enough."
" Ultimately chilling

" One of the best horror movies in years
",0.128,-0.9833,2020-10-26 00:00:00,9,"Father and son morticians have to autopsy the body of a young girl. The examination reveals how hard her death was and what was left inside her. The actress lies there on the autopsy table. Doesn't move a muscle. They open here eyes to check her eye color. Her eyes remain open as they carry on with the autopsy. There are lots of close ups of her face that linger for what seems like ages. You expect a jump scare. You don't know when it's coming but the girl is going to give everyone heart attacks....yet she doesn't. Throughout the film she remains motionless, dead. Yet strange things start to happen in the mortuary. The creepiness really ramps up and gets intense. It is one of those films that stays with you. As for me, I've watched it a couple of times and will watch it again. Still scary even though I've seen it before. Low budget, subtle horror done well is more scary to me that films like Haunted or Poltergeist, which are about as scary as a kiddies roller coaster. This film is a keeper, definitely."
" Scary
",-0.4939,-0.9986,2020-10-22 00:00:00,8,"I'm giving it 8 stars because it managed to scare me. The acting isn't perfect, the story isn't strong, but the fear factor level is high up. I'm not one to get easily scared with horror films, especially the recently made ones. However this one has a way of unsettling you and keeping you in a state of suspense. The story takes a backseat in this movie and they jump right into the horror scenes. If the horror scenes weren't successfully done, then this movie would be at 3 or 2 stars.It never goes in depth with the story of ""Jane Doe"" and how she ended up in that house in Virginia. It would have been nice to get small flashback scenes of her back in the day in Salem as the father and son coroners unlock different parts of they mystery. The father and son don't have a believable bond, as another reviewer mentioned, their dialogue seems very unnatural and forced. I don't think that's entirely the actors' faults, but a case of bad writing. A lot of the script was comically bad, I found myself confused or giggling at some of the things the characters said - lines that weren't supposed to be confusing or funny. As for the girlfriend character, it's apparent she was a forced storytelling device. She was annoying, if anything. When it's revealed that the father killed her and not one of their morgue zombies, you'll feel indifferent. Her storyline with the son was given less effort than the one with his father. From the start, you won't care if she gets her movie date or not. It even seems like the movie forgot about her until the dad accidentally kills her.Jane Doe's story was promising, they could've done a lot with that, but (as mentioned before) the focus was put on the horror scenes. I'm not one for gore, I usually find that more disgusting than scary. In this film though, it's a morgue so it's expected. I suppose the fact that they're cutting through an out of the ordinary corpse is what makes it unsettling, especially with all the random things they find in her corpse. The supernatural element adds to the chills - this is another thing that is tricky to do with horror films; a lot of the times this is done cheesily. All the spooky stuff starts to happen after they open her up and find the demonic symbols hidden in her intestines and first layer of skin. The song that plays when her corpse is present is perfectly unsettling too, so that was a good choice too. I suppose the other bodies in the morgue coming to life could've been done better. Not sure if it's because of the way they were animated, but they were more silly than scary. I get that it's to show how strong ""Jane Doe's"" supernatural powers are, but she's scarier than the two zombies; without having to move.All in all, it's a good scary movie. Perfect for this Halloween season or if you're just in the mood for a good horror film. Don't go into it expecting a perfect film, because it isn't, but it will satisfy your horror cravings. Give it a watch."
" Good One!

Sure there were some predictable moments. The cinematography, lighting, direction, and acting make this film stand out. One of the most unrelenting creepy horror I have seen in years."
" Suspenseful and interesting from start to finish
",0.4019,0.5984,2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Being a big fan of Brian Cox, it was easy to sit down and see what this film was all about. Cox and son Emile Hirsch work together in their funeral home, and they are tasked with finding out what killed an unidentified female body that gets brought in. Each step they take in performing their autopsy results in more and more implausible results, also shaking their working environment with power fluctuations, strange sounds, and the feeling that the two of them are not alone.Beyond the suspense and horror (and great special effects and makeup), the script also gives the father and son team the opportunity to bond and repair their own seemingly distant relationship. It turns out to be a parallel demonstration of redemption, both in their relationship, and in the eventual explanation of what happened to Jane Doe. Very well done."
" Intriguing story, well executed and greatly acted. Rarely you get all three in a horror flick.
",-0.3818,0.8591,2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,"Some horror films are best executed when they minimize the number of characters involved and reduce the settings to a minimum. With fewer elements to handle, some filmmakers are at their best managing the narrative, along with moments of tension and intrigue. This is exactly what Norwegian filmmaker André Øvredal accomplishes in The Autopsy of Jane Doe. Not only was he perfectly able to capture the mystery surrounding the corpse of Jane Doe by simply toying with elements that create an frightening atmosphere, such as flickering lights, strange phenomena and of course, every uncovered detail about Jane Doe, as both Tommy Tilden (Brian Cox) and Austin Tilden (Emile Hersch) are left perplexed by each finding while performing the autopsy. Being men of science, every discovery will shatter everything they believe in, and only by keep performing the thorough examination will they find a way to stop the horrifying events that occur to them.Both Cox and Hersch provide excellent performances, guiding the narrative to a safe point, even though the end isn't the resolution I would have hoped for, in my opinion it doesn't detach from the interesting narrative ground work layed down from the beginning. It's a fine film, executed well, scary enough to give itself credit for it.If you care for horror films that invest their time building up their atmosphere to then unleash the climactic moment in the right moment, this movie is right up your alley."

""Troll Hunter"" was a great ride.The first half is absolutely excellent - a captivating mystery unfolds as layers are peeled back exposing tantalizing clues to ""Jane Doe's"" fate.

Here we have these fantastic first 50 minutes in which a clash of science and the mysterious is foreshadowed, bit by bit, piece of evidence by piece of evidence. I really thought that this film will be the one that will break the tired old pattern of supernatural horrors out there. I really thought that this will welcome reason and strategy into a genre that is all camera tricks and scared Americans. But then it went back into the muck of shadow play, jump scares, unexplainable events and an ending that pretty much invalidates the entire film. Shame!So I am gonna rate this above average on the first 50 minutes and the acting alone. The rest is the usual swill. I recommend you pause after that period of time, take a break, think of all the great things that could have come from that... then stop the movie and not watch it anymore. Then tell all your friends of the wonderful film you imagined you've seen."

",0.7096,0.7658,2020-09-18 00:00:00,9,"Incredibly brutal without ever being truly gory, The Autopsy of Jane Doe may have some familiar elements throughout, but there is no doubt that it is one of the most stunning and original horror films I have seen in a long time. This film is truly original in many aspects, one aspect being its premise. From such a simple plot, you wouldn't expect something so complex without so much involved, but even as simple as it is, the film makes it work unlike any other, and is truly a great low budget success. The acting is surprisingly really good as well, with Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch providing terrific performances throughout. There isn't a huge cast, as most of the film focuses on the previous mentioned actors two characters, but that isn't to say that's a problem. The close and personal atmosphere between Cox and Hirsch makes for some of the films most suspenseful moments, and its shocking ways of revealing horror without seeing much of it first hand at all, is quite inspiring. The score is often phenomenal, as well as its cinematography and direction, as it not only acts so realistically, but truly feels that way too. There is a few lackluster moments throughout the film, although not many. A cheap jump scare once, a few predictable moments, and a few familiar ones as well here and there. In the end however, The Autopsy of Jane Doe proves to be one of the most clever and creative horror flicks in recent memory, and I praise it for its appeal of such horrific subject matter, with so little on screen and such a low budget.
My Rating: 9.5/10"
" Interesting ideas, but fail to be great. It's just average
",0.4118,-0.9797,2020-09-13 00:00:00,5,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe has interesting ideas and the potential to be a great horror movie but ends up as a disappointment. There are 2 main things I find really disappoints me and the cause of 5 stars rating I gave: The development of Jane Doe's character and the story of the father and son involved in it.First, about the development of Jane Doe's character. Her identity was quickly revealed, they provided many hints so it was easy to guess that Jane Doe was a witch. It was predictable but for me it's fine. What didn't fit quite right for me was they didn't try to expand the background story of Jane Doe. Until the end, we didn't really learn anything about Jane Doe except that she was a witch and probably became one because of the inhumane torture she experienced in the past. Why did I say probably? Because it was all an assumption made by the father (Tommy Tilden), but no flashback/proved evidence to support his statement.Second, about the development bond between the father and son. I think it's a good idea but cut short or the way they presented it isn't impressive enough. There were times it can be elaborated (the trapped in elevator scene) but it still feels lack in emotion. Obviously, not able to make me sympathize with the character, let alone cry over it.What's negative (besides the two main issues I already mentioned above):
The zombie stuff (walking dead people there) feels unnecessary and forcedThe visual effect near the ending appears like the one you will find in a cheap budget movie (smokey, colorful flashlights)What's positive:
They picked the right song ""Open up your heart (and let the sunshine in)"", it is really creepy esp. the scene before the endingGreat makeup for the Jane DoeOverall, the first part of the movie was interesting and intense but drops up quickly and will make you want to end the movie before it actually really ends. That's all my opinion. If you are really curious about the movie, you can still give it a shot but beware, you have been warned."

" SAW4 meets A haunting in Connecticut, in a bad way
",-0.6808,-0.9906,2020-08-29 00:00:00,1,"The beginning isn't that bad but immediately I noticed the similarities with the Saw franchise. The morgue/autopsy room was staged pretty much as in a random Saw movie. What happen next is a more or less ridiculous story about an autopsy going wrong as supernatural events are beginning to occur. This is also the point where things went downhill and the film lost me. The dialog between father and son is stupid, unnatural and forced. They constantly make irrational decisions while trying to survive in the ridiculously oversized basement. All horror clichés in the book are lining up: light goes out/starts flickering, electricity problems, radio suddenly plays ominous music or makes ""creepy"" noise, doors and latches open by themselves, the elevator becomes inoperable and pushing the button multiple times is futile. And so on... Worst of all, there is no real ending, just a hint that a sequel will come.
I watched it with my wife who hates horror movies. At the end she was shaking her head laughing at this totally overrated flick.Oh, one more thing: If you are curious how Jane Doe's face looks like, the director made sure your desire will be satisficed. I stopped counting after the 20th close-up."

I didn't find it overly scary but it was definitelt creepy and tense with one or two jumpscares as well.

",-0.3612,-0.7163,2020-07-21 00:00:00,7,"Unlike many films, this movie was great the first time, not as good the second. The first time watching this movie you are kind of in awe of the dark, wooden interior of the privately located town morgue. This film came out at the perfect time for its own good, being one of the first new horror films to lather itself in a comfortable and homely wooden interior like this. Sure there have been many before it( you' re next, it comes at night, etc) but it's a look that may have been scarce in the indie horror scene. This movie has a strong resemblance to several other films one of which being Marcel Sarmiento's ""Deadgirl"". Both films are similarly creepy and have a similar plot but ""Deadgirl"" focuses more on the cruelty of humans and what we are capable of. Another movie ""Autopsy"" reminds me of a little bit is ""Lake Mungo"". I say this because, like Lake Mungo, this mystery of this movie is very hard to wrap your mind around and for the first 2/3 of the film there is little explanation. This is common but it is still done quite mysteriously here. I personally love ""Lake Mungo"" and think this movie holds little flame comparatively. The first time i saw this movie I thought it was very clever and very creepy. This IS my type of horror and it delivered nicely. Also, the practical effects seemed to be spot on. However..., after watching it for the second time last night, I already knew how the story went. I already saw the cozy, lulling dark brown interior. I was ready to check it out in a new way....and unfortunately I was a little let down. The film sets itself up very nicely for what could have been an extremely scary horror film. A powerhouse of a movie if you will. I remember being very scared by the scary scenes with the corpses walking around, ringing their bells n what not. This time, though still creepy, I felt underwhelmed. Maybe my expectations were a little too high? But if that's the case, Orvedal still didn't meet them when every great movie should. Another thing I noticed was some of the practical effects, such as the over head shots of the corpse during the dissection scene, were poorly done. Jane Doe's breasts suddenly looked bumpy and unattractive. They were much smaller and squished looking. The prosthetics should have been better here considering the overall quality of the rest of the effects. I also felt this film lacked any real good kills. All the kills were too clean and collected and they didn't show enough. When it comes down to it, this movie is good but not great. It has a great story and could have been something much, much darker but ends up juust under achieving that. The polished look should have been substituted with a bit more grit. This movie feels like a rated R ""Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark"" spin off"

" Initial Great Expectations Dissolve Into Dubious Unlikelihoods!
",0.4389,0.9454,2020-07-15 00:00:00,5,"I have no hesitation in stating that the first half of The Autopsy of Jane Doe really did suck me in. The corpse of an unidentified young woman is found at the scene of a bloody multiple homicide, with no real clues to aid the local constabulary in solving the case. Local father and son coroners, played by Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch respectively are coopted by the town sheriff, to do an urgent autopsy on the corpse, so as to hopefully give the police some sort of lead to solve the murders.It's an intriguing set-up with 2 very experienced lead actors in Cox and Hirsch. Cox in particular is very convincing as a skilled small-town medical examiner, who we soon understand, won't be easily swayed from forensically seeking the truth behind mysterious deaths. Autopsy, though clearly not made on a huge budget, looks far superior in production standards to Norwegian director Andre Ovredal's earlier found footage films. It also boasts an excellent soundtrack and some realistic looking mortuary sets.But roughly at the half-way point of this compact story, things decidedly take a turn for the worst. Solving the mystery of Jane and the mysterious deaths, is relegated in importance, as we become immersed increasingly in a case of ""things going bang in the night"" and yes, zombies (of the non-flesh eating variety) suddenly appear, which are pretty common around the traps these days.From here on in, the narrative contrivances kick in, thick and fast to propel the story forwards. Tommy's and Austin's basement mortuary in their house, must be one of the few such facilities in the world that doesn't have a proper fire escape. It has an elevator, which we know won't work in a blackout and a weird spiral staircase to a trap door instead. Why? Because that might be needed later in the story. A supporting character is somehow able to gain access to the house and mortuary quite easily during a raging storm, when Tommy and Austin can't get out themselves. How? Don't even go there. All we find out is that ancient mumbo jumbo is able to control seemingly everything in the modern world; from the weather, to locks, telephone communications and even radio music programming.The second half of Autopsy is a real comedown. Tommy's and Austin's back stories, which aren't exactly deep anyway, we find have entirely no relevance to the final outcomes of the story and if viewers were waiting expectantly for an engrossing explanation to the first act discovery outlined above, I sincerely hope they are not holding their breaths. And then of course the final scenes leave open the possibility of a sequel, I don't think I'll want to see.I don't want to appear too down on The Autopsy of Jane Doe, but it just seems extra disappointing, when a very promising looking beginning, degenerates so swiftly into a second half of seen again morbid goings - on. I have to admit genuine surprise at the general high critical regard for this pretty average production."
" Started really well but missed opportunities and ended cheaply
",0.2266,-0.9675,2020-07-14 00:00:00,6,"From the moment when it became clear that the Jane Doe was a witch, you'd think the two heroes would swiftly get to the same conclusion and the plot would evolve. But then it took them AGES to understand and when they at last did, they made deductions so weird that it became difficult to follow. You'd think the girl was a witch, but then they start to imply that the way she was tortured PLUS their own work on her made her a witch? Then how do they explain the double skin?? And what about the markings on the father's body? He dies and it's the end? Why was he even marked? Lots of question marks and wasted opportunities but I give it a 6 because it was still a really creepy movie with lots of good acting. I was actually sad when the father and son lost their lives."

So as the movie marches it turns out to be an angry ghost is angry movie, packed with cliches.Once the protagonists cut into Jane Doe, she starts mercing people who hurt her corpse. No warning signs or hints of don't hurt my body or else. Foreshadowing is never established. Even the Egyptian Mummies had warnings.Cliche 1: pointless animal mutilation
She kills the family cat for....reasons. Why? The cat didn't hurt her. Killing of animals in a horror movie for shock value is over done and trite. Maybe the witch is a dog person? It severs no purpose other then to piss of animal lovers.Cliche 2: jump scares
When they give us our 1st jump scare (with the girlfriend) the audience is expecting it & becomes predictable and obvious. You can even set your watch to it.Cliche 3: unstoppable boo ghost
If everything the protagonists attempt end in failure, what's the point? They try to burn the corpse & even appease the ghost which all fail because she kills everyone anyway. Not to mention the ghost's powers seem to have no limit and she gains extra powers when called for by the script.Cliche 4: old switcheroo
The guy kills his g/f because the ghost girl switches a zombie with his girlfriend. How did the g/f get inside the room? There were only 2 entrances, the elevator which the protagonists were in, and heavy doors that were blocked by the fallen tree. Even the radio reports that roads will be impassable due to heavy rains.With all those factors, the g/f is Lizzie Bordened to death because the guy and audience believe that she was grandma stitch face who was chasing them earlier.Cliche 5: plot armor
Early in the movie we discover that smoke inhalation is a thing. Later on, Boo ghost Jane throws a light switch rave complete with smoke machine & blinky lights, but no dubstep. She accomplishes this by turning on the incinerator & filling the hallway with smoke, yet another power she somehow manifests. The protagonists walk through the smoke with no problem, except for a jump scare to contend with. No cough, blurry vision, dizziness...just another minor inconvenience.Conclusion: Discount Blair Witch is pissed off at the world & looking to get revenge on people that weren't alive when she tortured, like the movie audience. It would have been interesting if the protagonists were descendants from Salam witch judges, but this never explored."

" Excellent first half; fine second half; worth watching; worth recommending to family and friends
",0.886,0.6703,2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,"As usual, I watched this film without watching even a trailer. I dived in completely blind. I saw it had high ratings so I thought I should check it out. Watched it at midnight in my room alone on a 65'' HDTV on medium volume on Netflix.The first half of the film was great - everything was realistic. There was mystery, suspense, and great build up. The setting was perfectly chosen and the atmosphere was eerie. The camerawork was great and the acting was acceptable. The film had genuine suspense without any cheap dumb scares. So far it was excellent - great suspense and mystery created by excellent writing, directing, acting, and camera work. I was impressed so far and the film was a 10/10.Then the second half came - the film abandoned realism and dived into the supernatural. I was not expecting this at all and I must confess that I felt disappointed because the movie was a 10/10 so far with realism and also because II know that every time horror films go into the supernatural it just feels fake and prepostorous.One thing I did not like about this film is that the protagonists did not verbally question the initial strange things that started occurring. Any normal person would have said out loud, ""what the **** is going on here?"" But not these characters. The screenwriters failed here. it is common sense. Inexplicable things were happening and it was unrealistic how they reacted and this really bothered me (e.g. cat scene).The supernatural horror aspect of the film was good. There was just the right amount of it. There was maybe one or two cheap low-level scares and the rest was fine.The female corpse I though was an excellent choice for the film.The ending was fine (no spoilers). The story wrapped up. I feel at peace with this film's ending. I have seen many films with poorly written endings, and this film was not one of them. The writers Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing wrote an ending to a preposterous supernatural horror film that actually made decent sens and that was passable.After finishing the film I realized that the two protagonists alone did a great job in carrying almost the entire film, but I now realize that it would not have hurt to have the girlfriend female character actually be involved in the story. Some screaming from her would have been nice and helpful. I am not content with her short role in the film.On a separate note, I feel this film could have been even more amazing if they had stuck with realism and had never dived into the supernatural. The first half was just excellent.Conclusion:I do recommend watching this film if you like mystery, thrill, and horror. It is a good horror film worth watching and worth recommending to family and friends. It lost two stars from me because I am tired of preposterous supernatural premises in horror films and because of the unrealistic response from the protagonists to the supernatural.8/10"

",0.0,-0.0129,2020-06-02 00:00:00,2,"I think it is really overrated. Firstly, before I started it, I had very big expxectations due to all the good reviews I had read. It started promising an interesting, but as the film began to run, like after 30 mins, it started showing some cliche horror signs. Ok, the movie's idea to make a horror with an autopsy might be really unique, but it turned out to be predicatble and leak of creativity later, at least this is how it was for me: They involved a mystery and the plot was developing around there and when it was the time for the answers, they came up with nothing out of common or new, just predictible and weak.
I want to make a spoiler free review so I won't say more further."
" Suspenseful and entertaining

this movie truly defines the term ""horror"". in order to complete my review i have to give some spoilers which i am not giving so the review wont make sense.but in a nutshell, if you are bored of watching horror movies in which a savior saves all, watch this one."

",0.4215,-0.3506,2020-05-21 00:00:00,5,"I waited years for this to be on a streaming service so I could finally watch it. I looked forward to it as something new and original. But after watching it, I was disappointed.It started out great, a mystery that turns into a horror. That's the best way to evolve a horror movie. But then when the end started revealing itself, it was nothing more than your average, B rated cheesy horror flick. The final end was what we've come to expect from every single low-grade horror movie made in the last 30 years. It could have been great. But it was mediocre."
" pretty clever
",0.7351,-0.1298,2020-05-19 00:00:00,7,I dont watch a lot of horror movies . This is quite a good one. Not all gore and guts. Give ita watch.
" it's creepy, it starts well, but their resolution is disappointing. still is a pretty good flick.
",0.6597,0.5774,2020-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Now, don't get me wrong: this movie is scary. it creates a claustrophobic atmosphere because it's pretty much set in only one location and it never fells flat. the idea is also good and the scares are genuine. this is someone that knows how to create an horror environment and follow it through very well. the characters while not being utterly developed, are crafted enough in order for us to care about them. the pace is also well done, we don't see the time running time going, and they create enough complications in order to keep us entertained.but honestly i was hoping the resolution was different. while watching i felt like ""please don't go through that way, please don't go through that..."" but they did. the problem with this type of resolution is that it gives an excuse to work. they don't need to develop the plot enough, they just blame everything on that point and there you have it. for me is disappointing: i don't like these type of motives because for me they aren't creative enough. i like whodunnit movies in general and i love slasher flicks. but when it comes to this...only sometimes i think it work. and only sometimes because it's easier to blame everything on ""external"" reasons than to create a solution within the plot.still, it's a very well crafted horror and it did work. i'm a bit undecisive in between grades because of that. but i can't forget tha i was scared in some moments and the movie was able to create a very decent and well built atmosphere. and makes us guessing towards what could have happened. the scares never end though. i'm just disappointed about their resolution but i don't think i should be unfair to give an inferior grade. is a good horror flick that a lot of people will enjoy. need to check more stuf from ovredal."

" What A Horror Movie Should Be-The Autopsy of Jane Doe
",-0.5719,-0.962,2020-05-13 00:00:00,9,"Norwegian film director André Øvredal (Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark) creates an almost-perfect, truly frightening scary movie with his careful handling of The Autopsy of Jane Doe.Tommy and Austin (Brian Cox, Emile Hirsch), a father/son duo consisting of coroner and mortician, receive a late evening dispatch of an unidentified body from a curious crime scene. Town Sheriff Burke (Michael McElhatton) requests that the team complete an emergency autopsy so that he can report a cause of death in the morning press briefing. Teetering on twilight, The Autopsy of Jane Doe begins.As the multi layer examination commences the physical uncovers that while the corpse of Jane Doe (Olwen Catherine Kelly) is immaculately preserved, the internal system presents with multiple fractured bones, eyes that are greyed-over, a missing molar and a missing tongue. All of these signs are indicative that the corpse should appear bruised and bludgeoned on the outside. During the exam, incidental and strange supernatural occurrences begin to happen in the embalming room.The second phase of the examination; the internal evaluation, produces unnerving results when ritualistic items are discovered inside the digestive organs. The missing molar, a shroud with unknown symbols on it and more are recovered from inside Jane Doe's perfectly preserved body. Further questions arise when the internal organs appear burned and scarred with no indication the body had been altered on the outside. The discovery coincides with supernatural experiences becoming stronger and more dangerous in the mortuary, culminating in the first of several creepy encounters.Øvredal's execution of the autopsy is done with utmost respect throughout the film. Even the explicitly gory scenes are carefully handled. In doing so, Øvredal dreams up an exceedingly eerie atmosphere formed in reality compared to the many low budget horror movies who otherwise would treat the detail with abandon. When the supernatural events become fully realized, the contrast is that much more defined, creating a truly scary experience.The cast of The Autopsy of Jane Doe is stellar. Brian Cox (HBO's Succession) is at his best as is Emile Hirsch (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Into The Wild). The casting, the set design, the lighting and sound all contribute to make this one hell of a scary film, truly worthy of a watch."
" Worthless
",-0.4404,-0.7634,2020-05-12 00:00:00,2,I thought two big well-known actors in a movie I never thought these two would ever be in surprised me but the ratings were so good I watched it and the first 30 minutes were pretty cool in the last hour was unbelievably stupid it's just another worthless dumb horror movie
" Interesting concept but average film as best
",0.8248,-0.4215,2020-05-06 00:00:00,6,"First half 8/10
Second half 4/10
It's a waste of potential."
" The Dead Body...is the threat!
",-0.8398,-0.988,2020-05-05 00:00:00,8,"Never expected this kind of horror before. Dealing with a haunted dead body. Holy crap, it was nice to watch this movie. It was intense, it was creepy, and enjoyable. So The Autopsy of Jane Doe is about father and son(don't know their names but the stars: Emile and Brian) tries to figure out the cause of death for Jane Doe, only to find out that this body is more than just a dead body. In fact, this body actually contains a witch inside it. The Father and son tries to survive the wrath of the dead body. One more thing, they also use other dead bodies for the monsters and it works!"
" A cheap and foolish attempt
",-0.2732,-0.9408,2020-05-04 00:00:00,3,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe is so bad that writing a review seems rather superfluous. I had deeper expectations, real ones, but, to my disbelief, the result was a complete and utter unsatisfaction.The story and its development as a horror movie are near nothing. Cliche after cliche. Dull attempts to frighten viewers that don't work on real horror movie fans; good only for newbies and sensitive people.Acting was average. In fact, there is nothing to act on. Even Brian Cox was drowned in the silliness of the movie.Some interesting autopsy procedures and stuff, which are destroyed in the really weak scenario.Showing a young naked body on the autopsy table for 3/4 of the movie is another poor atempt to arise viewers' interest. Instead, I bet that having an 80 y.o. body of any gender on that table would have done the same, if not more, and maybe a more successful move.Illogical happenings for animals, people and their behaviors just exacerbated the foolish vibe of the movie, let alone objects involved.Ghost or paranormal stories just work with a strong screenplay. There is no need to have a lot of actors or investment for that. You just need to have credibility, a good story, a wise development, good camera works and up to the task acting, like the first Paranormal Activity movie.The actors' talking and deductions were way more interesting than the awful pictures and scenes thrown at viewers.The whole thing with the axe and its results was just horrible. I truly felt sorry for the axe.The overall medical examination flow and the father and son's deductions leading to their increased frightening are the only reasons to give the movie a rating of around 3, which is far more generous than it deserves.At the end, we have a half movie with near-zero fear factor, messed-up or non-existant plots, many unexplained things and many more ahead. Did the producers really thought of doing a sequel?!Don't stay away from the movie. Watch it to understand horror mediocrity at one of its best summits."
" Original
",0.3182,0.7307,2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,"It's difficult to find nowadays truly original scripts and story's. The autopsy of Jane Doe delivers one of this rare moments. It's a clever and creepy play with an intense atmosphere. As the movie progress it reveals layer by layer more horrific details about the who, what and why things are terribly wrong with the dead body/women called Jane Doe. The two male leads are soon confronted with things beyond their imagination and the viewer is caught right in between with some truly sinister scenes. There are luckily hardly any CG/special effects - the movies strength is the use of light and dark, faded colors & excellent camera work which ultimately lead to an unsettling atmosphere! So why no 9 or 10? In my POV is the Dad character at one point suddenly too smart and knows out of the blue too much which makes the finale a tad rushed. Still, a big YES if u are into creepy nightmares!"
" Had lots of promise
",0.3182,0.6837,2020-04-30 00:00:00,5,"This movie had lots of promise. I love the two main characters. For me the main two aspects I enjoy are the storytelling and the scenery / visuals. Both were lacking in this movie imo. The whole movie takes place in this basement morgue that's small and dark. They don't really set you up with a layout of the place either it's just random different rooms.The story had promise and was interesting idea, but for me it just doesn't add up / isn't explained well. I watched this movie based on the mystery aspect which falls flat. This movie was short and I felt it could be shorter."

Aside from a few plot issues in the third act that were just too convenient, I loved this movie from beginning to end.I highly recommend this one for horror movie fans."
" One of the Few Western horror movie I truly liked...
",-0.2023,0.7812,2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"I like 1st Sinister, 1st Conjuring, Exorcism, Autopsy of Hannah Grace, 1st The Ring & The Grudge (Japan ver.). The way of their stories is full of mystery at first and didn't rely on full mindless jumpscares with shallow plot. Excelent cinematography and building atmosphere. Although we need more details about who is Jane Doe origins (Just one phrase from the bible saying she's a witch is surely solid. Explaining how she's immune to fire and clean?). Also this movie giving me how details is an Autopsy process is. Still don't like the endings and how the Boy Girlfriend suddenly appears out of nowhere and died. But overall I highly recommend it.Need sequel but Every those movies i mentions at 1st paragraph had terrible sequel. So maybe it's better not..."
" A good movie that I wish was better
",0.8176,0.8823,2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,"I really like what this movie was trying to do early on, in particular in the first half, where we have a father and son digging in (literally and figuratively, mostly literally) to a body to discover the eerie and uncanny things that were done to her, and I was even on board for some (if not all) of the horror movie Shock and Awe theatrics once it has to get to that midway through.What ends up messing things up is when the filmmakers feel the need to explain what Jane Doe's deal is - right down to a convenient Bible passage with the numbers laid out just so inside of her, more or less - and when one starts to poke holes in the logic of what ends up happening, be it why Jane Doe is controlling the other corpses (who, to be fair, at least they didn't go with a creepy dead kid or creepy old lady, but did they all have to have such conveniently gruesome touches to them, from gunblasted head to sewn eyes) or why (REDACTED) is even down there at that particular point in the plot.In brief, Cox and Hirsch are terrific, Catherine got paid and does a lot with so very little, Lovibonf is underused, and it has its effective-creepy moments. But The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a prime example of filmmakers needing to be careful when it comes to sticking the landing on a story where maybe less said snd less explained the better. And last but not least... I'm kind of surprised that 17th century witches had such good merkins back in the day..."
" A clever take on supernatural horror
",-0.1779,0.41,2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"This starts rarely low key, albeit in a morgue below the coroner's house! But things start to go awry with the arrival of a body for autopsy.
There are several real scare moments for the fans of the genre. All this and the wonderful Brian Cox in a lead role.

The Jane Doe (Olwen Kelly) is very beautiful and sexy. I hope she could appear more like that in other movie. Overall is very good. I just feel sad about the ending. The good guy should have been left to life"
" Beware of the Pretty Corpse
",-0.128,-0.9311,2020-03-23 00:00:00,7,"There are not many movies that get away with long explanations after a good part of the action has taken place. «Psycho» is an extreme example, but not everyone is Hitchcock. And there are fewer movies that can regain their impetus when the authors introduce those clarifications when something highly dramatic has taken place, like «The Autopsy of Jane Doe». When one of the two leading characters (who happens to be the father of the other) has accidentally killed his son's girlfriend, how inopportune the following scene is!When the Tildens (father played by Brian Cox and son, by Emile Hirsch) are performing the autopsy of a sinister thing that seems to be a corpse, it is justifiable that they talk a lot and make deductions, drawings, extractions, annotations, as they record the necropsy. There is also very good chemistry between Cox and Hirsch, making the long sequence more interesting. If the spectators get into the story, they will experience high tension, as the Tildens deduce, cut parts, discuss, over the beautiful but terrifying pale body of a 20-year-old woman who can be reanimate at any time, according to the free logic of ""fantastique"" genre.There are thunders, outside there might be a flood, and then the lights explode, the phones do not work, the emergency door is blocked, the Tildens decide it is time to get the hell out of the morgue, and a corpse stalks them in the dark, as they fight for their lives... But when they start to tie up all loose ends, the movie slows down, and though it recovers its pace again, nothing is as forceful as before.It is a pity the authors did not find the right equilibrium for the dosage of information, and added too much clarification in the wrong places, but there are not many innovative horror movies today with a clever story line like «The Autopsy of Jane Doe». Roman Osin's cinematography is fine and the interior design of the old morgue is elegant. Director André Ovredal does a good job, especially if I compare it with the only other title of his filmography that I know, the dreadful «Trollhunter». Not this time. I am glad I finally saw this 2016 release."

But i truly enjoyed this movie because it was different from what you normally get! If i had to describe the movie in 3 words: Creepy, toe-curling, disturbing. But in all good ways! You will be trying to figure out what happened to the body of Jane Doe like you're the person doing the autopsy lol. Very different and i LOVE movies that bring something different to the table. I gave it a 7/10 because I dont like jump scares and I just think they could've improved on some audio a bit. There wasnt much creepy sounds for a horror movie lol. Still kept me on the edge of my seat tho!"

The first 45 minutes of this movie is creepy and interesting, it is compelling. Similarly, the last 20 minutes are edge of your seat terror. But a chunk in the middle makes me feel like it's a whole new movie entirely.Separately, a main thing I loved about this movie is how the Jane Doe just... lies there. I know that sounds stupid, but usually these types of scenes with coroners are short, a whole movie about it feels positively creepy and intense. 7.5/10"

" Haunting, Contained Horror Film
",-0.7003,0.9977,2019-12-19 00:00:00,9,"This film I had heard a lot about and had been on a list for me to see. Stephen King, who is my favorite author, gave it a resounding endorsement and I have some of the podcasts that I listen to have shows on it. That was the reason I sought this out. I'm updating this after a second viewing, as I kept speaking highly of it and wanted to show Jaime. The synopsis is a father and son, both coroners, are pulled in a complex mystery while attempting to identify the body of a young woman, who was apparently harboring dark secrets.We start off at a crime scene. We have Sheriff Burke (Michael McElhatton) going room to room as we see this horrific scene. There are bodies and blood everywhere. He gets a call and goes to the basement. There he meets with a Lieutenant Wade (Jane Perry). A body has been dug up in the basement they're dubbing Jane Doe (Olwen Catherine Kelly) as they're not sure of her identity. They need answers to what happened to her, but we learn that it seems that no one broke in, everyone was trying to get out. It doesn't help that the news is there as well.We then meet the local coroner, Tommy (Brian Cox). He works with his son, Austin (Emile Hirsch), who is a licensed medical examiner as well. They go over a body of a burned man and we see that Tommy is very good at what he does. Austin knows his stuff, but he still doesn't have the eye yet. He also seems to take the easiest answer. They finish up and Austin is spooked by his girlfriend Emma (Ophelia Lovibond). She wants to see what Austin does and Tommy shows up to encourage it. He ends up scaring her with a bell that is tied to the ankle of one of the bodies.The couple goes to leave when Sheriff Burke shows up with the body of Jane Doe. Austin breaks plans with Emma, stating that his father needs him. She's upset, because he hasn't told his father yet that he doesn't want to do this for the rest of his life. She allows him to stay and will come back later so they can go out.We learn that Tommy has dedicated his life to this and his wife, who has passed away, wasn't happy. He carries this grief with him and Austin knows it too. He tells Austin that he doesn't have to stay to help, but Austin committed, especially with the urgency of this case.They soon realize that there is something not quite right with the body. On the outside there's no cause of death. They find her wrists and ankles are smashed, her waist is much too small to be natural and her eyes are clouded over. There is no rigor mortis. As they start to delve deeper into the autopsy of this unknown woman, the clues become stranger and stranger. There is also something supernatural presence. These two men are in for a night they did not expect when a storm suddenly appears, trapping them inside.I want to lead off stating that I'm glad I saw it. I didn't see a trailer for this one, so I came in excited but blind. I loved the concept of the film. We have a body that is brought in, there are no signs of what killed her on the outside, but the more they cut into her and look, they see that a lot of terrible things happened to her. It doesn't make sense and that makes the mystery even better.What I also really liked was that you can feel the tension building with each new clue or supernatural thing that happens. I could feel my anxiety going up and I wasn't disappointed by that at all. This film is very well written. I thought the editing of the film was good. The running time is perfect and it builds tension throughout. That doesn't always mean there is something going on constantly, because it doesn't need that. It has its lulls that allow us to breath, but they aren't boring. Something is still happening to build toward the end which I was a big fan of. Going along with this though, the claustrophobia of where they are helps to that and it is aged. You can believe that their elevator out could break or that the tree did fall to trap them inside.What makes this even better was that the acting was just as good as the writing. Cox and Hirsch were great together. I have seen both of them in a lot of other things and just seeing them together I knew this film was going got be good. Hirsch doesn't do a whole lot, but when he does he definitely picks films that he can showcase his abilities. There's a scene where the two of them are trapped in an elevator. What they talk about doesn't have a lot to do with the story, but seeing them go back and forth was great. I also need to give props to Kelly. I'm not entirely sure what they did with her or what she had to do, but she is completely nude at some point for the prep of the film. She doesn't have to do anything, but lie there yet it was extremely creepy. The supporting cast I thought did well for what they needed to do.Next I want to touch on the supernatural aspects of the film. This one does a great job at using what look to be a combination of practical effects and CGI. There are some other corpses in this film that come to life and for the most part they are done with make-up. They look great, but the film also was strategic in its use of shadows and only giving us a glimpse. Our imaginations at times can be scarier than what we actually see and this film utilizes that. There is a scene with computer generated fire that I wasn't a big fan of, but it is short and at the end of it, it makes sense why the fire did what it did.I also loved the soundtrack to the film. We get a recurring song that you know something bad is going to happen. We also get the radio to act funny during these times and sets the stage as to what is happening outside which I thought were great ideas. Really helped to build the tension we get here. There's also a song that keeps playing that is a reference to Tommy and his deceased wife. That just adds a creepy vibe there. On top of that though, we get like a bell and it ties back to something we learn earlier. There is ambient sounds that help to drive the tension for sure.Now with that said, I would recommend seeing this film. It has a simple plot to it, but the complexity comes from the autopsy itself. It doesn't make sense how she dies at first, yet the more they uncover, the more tension it builds. This film is very well written. The acting is amazing from the two stars. The anxiety of what is happening builds to an amazing ending in my opinion. I thought the editing was good, the effects are solid and the soundtrack fits well as to what is happening. This is a supernatural thriller, so keep that in mind, but I definitely recommend giving this one a viewing."
" Excellent low budget indie mystery-horror
",0.3818,0.9119,2019-12-12 00:00:00,7,"Before I start I have to put a warning for animal lovers, the cat does die, if this turns you off do not watch this film.
Ok onto the actual review.
This is a pretty good low-budget indie film about a concept not used very much, the story is constantly moving forward in gruesome and gory manner (not for the squeamish), the lighting is insanely well done, the acting is pretty good and feels believable, the mystery revolving around the witch (Jane Doe) is incredibly palpable and intriguing though I do wish it was touched upon more.
Which leads me to the problems of the film.
The cinematography is for par, it's nothing you haven't seen before its not terrible just average
As I said I do wish the mystery around the witch was touched on more (maybe extending the movie half an hour would have worked) don't get me wrong the mystery is far from being bad, its actually incredibly good, which is why I wanted more of it.
Sometimes there are needless things, most notably is the girlfriend being killed, it comes out of nowhere and is quickly forgotten about it feels like it was put in for an emotional scene and little else.However this movies good parts far exceeds its bad ones. Definitely watch it"

Nothing like the multitude of really badly written and directed horrors that are out there. Don't be fooled by the title of this movie. It's one that is really worth watching. You won't be disappointed. I truly wasn't. Then again it depends what you class as horror doesn't it, so this short review might not be worth the read to some of you.

Got even more than I was expecting.Here we have a horror movie with paranormal elements. In said premise is very easy to fall into superficiality and turn into a gore-fest and rely solely on cheap jump-scares just to get the ""Horror"" label and an R rating. But not this time!This movie is not happy with just being another paranormal horror flick; it takes its time to develop a setting and a mood and it doesn't take a step forward in going full horror until the fear and feel of dread is already in your head. And once the paranormal kicks-in, it only shows the necessary amount of it.I loved every single part of it, gets a 9 for having a predictable moment in the second half. But goes straight to my list of horror movies that I'll remember."

",0.6249,0.525,2019-10-20 00:00:00,10,"For me, this film is very nearly flawless. The direction, sound, lighting and reveals create an unrivalled atmosphere of claustrophobic spookiness.If I could dock less than a point from the score, my only criticism would that's there's an unnecessary bit of exposition (or rather speculation) towards the end, which seemed to be paving the way for a different ending. Since the finale swerved away from that, we're left with a brief passage that isn't required and slightly tested my suspension of disbelief. But really, I'd only dock about 0.3 stars for that. It's a contender for the best horror film of the 21st Century."

Apart from the outstanding actors Hirsch and Cox, who with 2 auxiliary actors (or 3 😉) make the film an absolute must for all fans of sophisticated tension and horror movies, in my view, ALL has succeeded and apart from ""Carrie"" and 2.3 other films I can not think of anything comparable. ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" wraps the viewer in a mysterious, with small and large moments of shock spiked goose bumps, but does not swing to a shocker, with a good conscience the label on the back of the DVD label ""Without a doubt the best Friends of moodily morbid horror products will not be disappointed, especially as they are allowed to watch two talented actors breathing life into their characters, and in the true sense of the word!"

It is amazing how it keeps you waiting for something to happen all the time and just when you think something it's gonna happen it doesn't and you just keep waiting and waiting, not for too long but just the right time to scare you with your imagination. There are definitely some scenes that shouldn't had happened like the cat scene or the inexplicable appearance of the boys girlfriend. But any other than that it's super well executed. It keeps you tense, alert and watching for little hints all he time so I think that's what makes a good terror movie.

" Classic horror, as we know it.
",-0.5719,0.9889,2019-10-03 00:00:00,7,"""Suspense"" is the keyword here.This movie is very ""Hollywood"". It has all the horror classics, we know and love. From jumpscares to creepy monsters.It really is a modern, horror classic and that is a huge compliment compared to many movies out there. There are some movies who take the Hollywood aspect too far and just ends up being super cringy, so you have to curl your toes while watching them. Then there are other movies who completely forgets that horror movies have a meaning to them and just ends up being constant jumpscares, which makes you immune and you just sit and yawn through them. This movie is a perfect balance between the two.Story wise it builds the tension so well and it doesn't take long for something to happen, so it is not boring at all. Definitely the kind of movie you'd bring friends over to watch.Now like all movies this movie isn't perfect, there are many flaws but i won't get too much into these, you'll have to figure those out for yourself. However i would like to note that even though the plot is great and the actors play well there are some things that just doesn't make sense in the way the characters act.Another problem is actually the fact that it does resemble a horror classic and the problem with those is that they are (usually) really, really predictable.Also this movie isn't super scary, it just does your head in a few times.Aside from these few points, the movie was really good and i would definitely recommend watching this with your girlfriend/boyfriend and/or your friend(s)."
" This movie was almost great. Just missed the mark.

The ambiance, the creepiness, the mystery and slow creeping realization that ""something's not right here.""The first 2/3 of the movie was perfect. I am not one for gore, so the autopsy made me kind of squeamish, but was glad I could stick it out.The reason I pushed this film down to a 7 was that they showed way too much and then punctuated every fifth scene with a low-key jump scare.The ringing bell on the foot was obviously going to factor into a later sequence of events. How could it not? I still loved that touch. But right after the cat died, that's when the atmospheric power of the film started to unravel and return to a status quo type of horror movie.Once the director started to show the dead bodies marching around, that's when the movie lost its terrifying oomph that distinguished the first half of the movie.Regardless, it still scores relatively high for a horror/thriller. A pleasant surprise."

The movie could have went so many different ways and provided a satisfying outcome that would have left the viewer satisfied.. however the movie just kind of cut off and killed off every main character except the Sheriff. I understand that most horror movies are ruthless. However the director built up alot of character traits that the viewer came to enjoy.. and then just kills them off in a goofy ending. There were also many plot holes in the movie, such as the family that was killed in the house, this was percieved that it was going to be a main plot line to the movie, however it was never really explained or resolved , leaving the viewer unsatisfied and with many questions."

About a half hour in, the movie was so intense, I actually had to take a break. When I resumed, it didn't take 5 minutes to start playing games with my head. I should mention that this overcast day had turned stormy. My cats seemed to be getting spooked themselves. And as the thunder rumbled outside both of my cats became transfixed on my fireplace with no fire. They both were wide eyed starring. As the scene had just shown a big crawling out of the corpse, it totally freaked me out to look over at the fireplace to see a big crawling out of my fireplace and slowly up the facing......THAT'S ENOUGH! I put the movie on pause, killed the bug, and attempted to start it again. But when the flickering of lights in the movie began to occur, my home's lights did the same, and I called it quits.Thank God I watched in the afternoon and have time to clear my head or I doubt I would sleep."
" Meh
",-0.0772,-0.9552,2019-09-12 00:00:00,5,"I would have rated the movie more if the whole movie was only about the autopsy. For me it is more terrifying to stare at cutting and opening a dEaD cOrPsE rather than watching the b-s shenanigans at the end.
Story-wise, I feel like it was a forced attempt to give a meaning with all the anomaly, which is done poorly. It is foolish of me to try and work out anything meaningful out of it. After all it is a horror movie.Verdict: It's not something that leaves a scratch in your mind."
" Great effects, solid acting, and a slightly disappointing conclusion.
",0.4201,-0.8169,2019-09-06 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed the first half of this film as a macabre thriller. Good acting from both leads and a quick suspenseful pace set in a cold morgue helped grab my attention from the start. Very well done gore effects also help suck you in to the plot and filming style and add a nice touch to the suspense. The more the film unravels, the more you wanna figure out the mystery of ""Jane Doe"".However, I feel the mystery and interest quickly drop off by taking the viewer to a place we've already been a hundred times before with most B list horror films. The 2nd half, although providing an ample amount of jump scares and creepy shots to keep you paying attention, feels rushed and predictable. As soon as you think you've figured out what's going on, well, you pretty much have and then you're just riding it out to see how it ends. I'm not saying I could have written a better twist/ending, but my expectations surely got cut short by the second half of the film. With an ending that was just, meh.Pretty scary if you don't watch a lot of horror and still a solid pick for a Netflix horror movie night. I've seen worse, but I've also seen better."

" The Autopsy of Jane Doe (Gut)
",0.0,-0.9955,2019-08-08 00:00:00,9,"Zu Beginn des Films werden in einem Haus, mehrere grauenhaft zugerichtete Leichen gefunden. Im Keller finden die Ermittler außerdem die Leiche einer unbekannten, jungen Frau (Olwen Catherine Kelly), die im Sand vergraben liegt. Sheriff Burke (Michael McElhatton) liefert diese Leiche persönlich zur Autopsie bei Austin (Emile Hirsch) und seinem Vater Tommy Tilden (Brian Cox) ab. Eigentlich wollte Austin ja den Abend mit seiner Freundin (Ophelia Lovibond) verbringen, allerdings entschließt er sich dazu, das Treffen zu verschieben und seinem Vater lieber bei der Autopsie zu helfen. Da es sich um eine Unbekannte handelt, nennen Vater und Sohn die Leiche Jane Doe und Beginnen mit der Autopsie, um so schnell wie möglich Ergebnisse zu haben. Im Laufe der Autopsie machen die beiden immer mehr Entdeckungen, die nicht so recht ins Bild passen. Außerdem geschehen immer mehr ungewöhnliche Dinge in dem Keller.""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" von Regisseur André Øvredal (Trollhunter) macht den Titel zum Programm. Der Film beginnt mit Morden, ohne dass der Zuschauer weiß, was da gerade passiert ist (keine Sorge, im Laufe des Filmes wird alles gut aufgeklärt). Dies baut gleich zu Beginn die nötige Spannung und Motivation auf, den Film weiterschauen zu wollen. Dies gelingt dem Film über die gesamte Länge hinweg, immer wieder. Man vertieft sich in die Handlung und schaut gespannt den Entdeckungen von Austin und Tommy zu und wie es den beiden gelingt das Puzzle Stück für Stück zu lösen. Empfindliche Leute möchte ich hier warnen, denn besonders bei der Autopsie, sind die Bilder äußerst detailliert. Hier kann der Film also eindeutig punkten. Ansonsten folgt ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" den gängigen Methoden und lässt Radios scheinbar aus Geisterhand laufen oder aber Lichter flackern. Die Jumpscares, die natürlich auch nicht fehlen dürfen, sind größtenteils vorhersehbar und haben, zumindest mich, nicht sonderlich groß erschrecken können. Zu Beginn geht es dabei recht harmlos zu, allerdings häufen sich die Vorfälle, bis ca. ab der Mitte des Films, der Spuk richtig beginnt. In dieser Phase weiß der Film auch an der ein oder anderen Stelle zu überraschen. Allerdings plätschert er eher vor sich her und legt einige Informationen der Charaktere offen.
Das Ende des Films kann dann aber wieder überraschen und lässt keine der, im Laufe des Filmes aufkommenden Fragen, unbeantwortet. Spätestens hier, wird auch wirklich jedem klar, was zu Beginn des Films geschehen ist.Fazit: ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" ist ein wahr gewordener Mythos, der durchaus seine Momente hat. Zombies, Geister, Hexen und vieles mehr, haben einen großen Einfluss und bilden das Gerüst von ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"". Einen absoluten Pluspunkt bekommt der Film, wegen seiner tollen und detaillierten Bilder, die einem auf den Magen schlagen können. Fans von Horrorfilmen, aber auch Einsteiger, werden sicherlich ihren Spaß haben und im Laufe der 86 Minuten gut unterhalten. Von mir gibt es 4/5 Popcorntüten."

The father has a theory as to who the Jane Doe is and what happened to her, but there's no confirmation that that's what actually happened, from what I remember.

",-0.8555,0.9407,2019-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Probably one of the most disturbing movies I've seen in recent years. The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a Norwegian film made from head to toe with the simple idea of scaring through the story of a corpse, however, it is their narrative and execution that make it so good at delivering terror and mystery.Full of suspense that is built minute by minute as more details are revealed about the true story behind the corpse. The film manages to keep us on the edge of our seats waiting for the next clue, and finally delivers a final act with great precision and quality that awakens all our senses and gives us goose bumps. It's the mystery that keeps us glued to the seat, but it's the truth behind it all that makes us feel the real terror, the sense of fear in discovering a dark truth behind everything.Excellent performances, decent cinematography, a great soundtrack, a fantastic script, an incredibly creepy atmosphere and a very interesting story, make this horror movie a real train journey through dark corners.

A intriguing mystery then unfolds within the confines of the examination room and office as the two peel back the metaphorical and literal layers behind this Jane Doe's unusual death. The film become more engrossing as it builds tension and the mystery becomes more and more inscrutable. This is where the film started to lose me. When the story was more of a mysterious crime procedural, I was all-in and when the film started leaning towards unexplained phenomenon which still might have a scientific explanation, I was still with the film, but when it went full supernatural I was somewhat disappointed and felt the writers took the easy way out story-wise. However, the film is consistently scary, suspenseful, and intriguing, so it absolutely held my interest and kept engaged me much more that most horror films. André Øvredal is a director to watch, bringing style and atmosphere to the proceedings. His first solo feature film, ""Trollhunter,"" was a campy monster hunter movie, but with ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" he establishes himself as a director who can do straight horror as well, which makes me even more excited to see his adaptation of the classic 1990s children's horror book collection ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark."" Overall, ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" is a unique and clever horror film, but would have been even stronger if it had managed to pull off more ambiguity around its supernatural elements."
" Slightly Above Average
",0.0,-0.8907,2019-06-17 00:00:00,6,"I like the simplicity of this film, the attention to detail when it came to the graphic nature of the autopsy, and I liked the pacing and the twists. This is a fun little bottle movie that works well for the most part. It's not a movie that will be remembered in twenty years, but it's a film that's worth watching if you've got some time to kill and you're looking for a few thrills. This is no ""Hereditary"" or ""Exorcist""; it's a low budget horror film that's slightly less schlocky and slightly smarter than the run of the mill horror flick."

" Starts good and creepy then...
",0.4404,-0.465,2019-06-09 00:00:00,5,It started out good and creepy. The actors were good and added to the creepiness by not being creeped out themselves. Obviously being around dead bodies in the basement is nothing new to them. Obviously us the viewers were creeped out by being in a basement with a dead body. So when the autopsy starts to go into the realm of the supernatural the dad keeps trying to work it out knowing that everything has an explanation. But the son starts to see there's something amiss and they should leave. Right when you get to about 2/3 of the way through the movie you should just turn it off and imagine your own ending. Seriously. The ending that the writers and producers etc. put together was beyond weak. It didn't answer any questions that the movie brought up. It didn't give us any insight into ideas that the actors brought up. It didn't clearly show what happened or what was going to happen. So my best advice is to watch 2/3 of it and turn it off. Sit around the campfire and make up different endings to it. That's going to be so much more entertaining than the disappointment you will feel watching the actual end of this movie.

Good lighting and sound and camera work, but, for instance, the main characters jump from ""we are so very scientific and seasoned"" to ""wow, this must be supernatural"" in zero time. The last third of the movie is just cliché. I could predict every single jump scare. The final moment would have totally impressed me in the early 80s when I first started watching horror. Today this was just so lame I can hardly believe they actually did that.
What a wasted idea, budget and (in parts) talent.
4 stars for camera work, sound, lighting, make-up and the basic plot idea. Maybe I could have given it 5 stars, but I think it's pretty overrated."

Always have loved horror and is 100% my genre of choice. Always been able to appreciate a movie for what it is and i think thats y ive loved the genre over all others. So many choices that arent trying to deliver more than just the cliche, gore, jump scares, ocassional nudity, and some memorable characters, its always been enough for me to become my easy go to... once in a great while though u find a horror movie that actually engages u with the story, direction, and atmosphere. When u can truly become immersed if you allow yourself to be, and when that happens u have not only some of the best horror movies, u have some of the best movie experiences that will stay with u for life... this movie surprised me so much. The whole time i was locked in, and im ADD case poster boy, whos wheelhouse is to toss on killer klowns any day of the week and be half in my phone/half watching the screen 99% of the time. When u start focusing on how little this story had to work with, (locations, characters, somewhat small story/concept), it just kept blowing me away how involved and locked in i was, and how the director and writer was able to stretch it out in the best way possible, and keep me engaged 100%. Any movie lover should appreciate if not like this movie, and any horror fan i think regardless of what sub genre u appreciate most, will love this movie. And if you dont, u are wrong.

" We have a diamond in the rough here.
",0.34,0.9818,2019-03-11 00:00:00,5,"A lot of horror begins intriguingly but then goes to sea.I like the premise of this and I feel it could have been really spooky and mysterious if only it weren't quite so heavy handed with itself.There's a moment in the first act where you suddenly realise that we are in for a semi-chamber piece. Most (not all, but most) of the action is on our two (well I guess it's three including Jane) characters who actually do keep the show going pretty well by themselves. They feel like real people and I have a lot of patience for them.Sadly the movie kind of stretches its own premise a bit thin and by the end it has decayed into a more generic horror. I feel it would have worked much better as a much shorter film. Maybe about 30 minutes. It has a compact, neat folkloric quality that sadly gets worn out by the half way mark.Although rather disappointing I hope people see this, just to encourage them to make more like this. It's definitely more dignified and adventurous than the trash that sometimes gets touted as superior horror like The Conjuring or The Descent.Not worth going out of your way to see but give it a look if it's on."
" Very Smart And Clever - All One Location
",0.7397,0.7423,2019-03-11 00:00:00,10,"This is a very well done film that takes place in only one spot - a morgue. I'm not sure why more people haven't been talking about this film, but it succeeds where Hereditary did not - it is able to go from reality to supernatural without being convoluted or having too much story.It is also very scary and has a surprising ending. The writers set up everything and pay it off - it makes you think - they did a fantastic job with the writing. The director also did an exceptional job with the corpse - in that it's so beautiful it's terrifying and he repeatedly has close ups of the face and the slightly crooked teeth and beautiful hair that gives you chills because it looks so dead but is yet so alive.I appreciate too that they didn't go full on for gross out and gore - even though an autopsy is being performed - it is medical and does not go for cheap gags and gore. Yes, there are those squeamish moments but the director did not take the liberty to really gross you out or make it over the top - and for me who is squeamish I was actually able to watch the whole thing without turning my head away. Sure I had a few ewwws but it was not cheap or over the top.I love too, the ending because you don't see it coming with an unusual twist and how they actually make you feel sorry for the corpse then not, is she evil or the subject of evil done to her?The film was not completely successful - there were moments where I found a lull or felt that for example they would be more freaked out about what was lingering in the hallways and not so easily go into them - but I still have to give it a ten. It created a world and story that was not only unique, but scary and smart and to do it all in one location is not easy. It's really one of the best I've seen done in one location and for that even with some of the smaller flaws it makes it a TEN!"

" Well Crafted Tension Fill Horror Mystery
",-0.5994,0.9597,2019-03-04 00:00:00,7,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe only hit my watchlist because of the director André Øvredal. He is currently working on Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, produced by Guillermo del Toro. The word around the net was it was a good fit with the director because his previous film was pretty good. I grew up with the book Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. It freaked me out and the cover still gives me the willies when I see it. But this seemed to be another passion project for Del Toro. Even though I'm not a big fan of Del Toro (that's a subject for another time) I am a fan of the book. So hearing that Øvredal was a good fit from the net and that he was working with Del Toro, I thought it was a good idea to check out his last feature, which was getting good word of mouth.I went into this film stone cold. And I'm glad I did. I picked up on a few clues early on and figured out the main ""twist"". That didn't deter me from the film, I just pick up on something kind of quickly. The film opens up with a gruesome multiple murder scene. Four people have been brutally murdered. The sheriff (Michael McElhatton) is dumbfounded. These were good people and he has no know idea what happened. To make matters even more confusing, a woman's body is found buried in the cellar. She is pristine but dead. Needing to find answers quickly, he rushes the body to town medical examiner and his assistant son (Brian Cox, Emile Hirsch). As they dig deeper into the body the more this mysterious woman's situation get complex and dangerous secrets are uncovered.I tried to be vague as possible because this film comes out of left field with some answers. It also raises a few more questions. Øvredal does an excellent job of building tension as most of this film takes place in the medical examiner's autopsy room and surrounding areas. But we are shown just enough of the building to feel stuck down there without characters. He has a decent amount of jump scares but doesn't overuse them. He builds a creepy atmosphere and dread very well. With the help of cinematographer Roman Osin, Øvredal shoots this film beautifully with a drab color palette and old style setting. The film plays out like a dramatic thriller then leading into full-on old school haunted house horror. It nice to see a film use in-camera effects over special FX. It gives the film a realism that we don't always get with horror films nowadays.Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch are excellent as the father and son examination team. Cox, genre staple, leading into the broken father just trying to teach his ways to his son. Hirsch plays the son who thinks he knows it all but really just needs an out in his life. They are both dealing with something that pushes them away from each other. They play that chemistry well. They do care for each and there is an excellent scene in the middle of the film that dives into both of their characters. Ophelia Lovibond plays Hirsch's girlfriend who knows that his character should be elsewhere. She only gets a few scenes but there's never a doubt this connection is forced. Olwen Catherine Kelly may have the hardest job I've seen an actress play in a while as Jane Doe. All the props to her for being just the body on a slab that tells the story of the film.I know that I have written this to review the film but the best way to see this film is to know as little as possible. I didn't even watch the trailer. André Øvredal has created a creepy, very atmospheric even claustrophobic horror film here that is a good night watch. With the excellent performance from Cox and Hirsch, the wonderful cinematography and mystery at the core of the story, The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a definite watch for horror fans. Even if the twist is somewhat predictable and the ending of the film goes full-on horror instead of sticking with tension and dread this is film works. I'm pleasantly optimistic that Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark might be a pretty entertaining and even scary."

" Not a Complete Movie
",0.0,-0.8714,2019-02-27 00:00:00,1,"This movie has so many holes in it, you're basically getting ripped off. I understand you don't want to give a background or history lesson too early on in the movie to ruin the suspense of sort of figuring out who Jane Doe is (I say that because at the end, we still don't know), but this movie definitely needed some exposition at least later on. There isn't anyone who is an expert on anything Jane Doe is causing, which is fine at first, but then as the movie goes on, you're basically watching a movie about bugs being squashed because the protagonists don't have any background on what they're dealing with, so there's no possible solution to be found. They start making assumptions, stuff happens in the meantime, they do dumb things like start a fire in the autopsy room, then Brian Cox jumps on the corpse yelling at it to spare his son, and next thing you know his limbs are breaking. It doesn't make any sense. We're watching a movie with random things coming up that don't make any sense, and are not explained. We just have to accept it, and then in the end nothing is even learned. Essentially 90min wasted.
If you're okay with watching an incomplete movie with cliches and cheap jump scares, then this is for you. Otherwise, steer clear of this stinker."

",-0.8402,-0.9925,2019-01-26 00:00:00,4,"Long on my radar, I'd heard great things about this film. However, unlike the hype surrounding ""Hereditary"", I found Jane Doe's unfounded.Many reviews cite the film as not being cliche, being original, and not relying on the typical gore and jump scares. I'm not sure we watched the same film. The only unnerving bits involve the largely accurate autopsy. And it is in this film's first act, that it is strongest.There is a tension in wondering what happened to this corpse filled with oddities and impossibilities-and the longer this process drones on, the more it becomes one hundred percent clear exactly what's going to happen at every stop. You come to know what the protagonists will say before they even do.Add to this a plethora of cliches-putting down the pet, jump scares you see coming 12 miles off, flickering lights, an old radio song repeatedly playing about the devil, a very poorly done fog scene...By the end of the film I was just begging for it to finish. All that the enigma of Jane Doe boils down to is a cop out on the Salem witch trials. Yawn. The father & son come to conclusions about this whole situation in absolute deus ex machina.There are many hints at the father's inability to cope with the suicide of his wife, but it amounts to nothing. It's totally irrelevant to anything, and is not resolved, because, he merely blames himself for her death, and then dies. The ""let the sun shine in"" song only serves as an irony to the fact that he called his wife ""ray"", as in, ray of sunshine, and it is mind numbingly cringe worthy.Were the script scrapped, and the concept salvaged into something of actual substance, something more interesting than a witch whose corpse is, assumed to have done this for ??? 300 years???, this film could have hit the mark. It goes from tense to boring very quickly, and it's predictability leaves it dead on the coroner's table, with no way of fighting back."

The plot and the great acting really draws you in.And then the 2nd half of this film just completely let itself down.
Full of horror cliches (looking into a hole and someone appearing) etc. Certain death scenes are just so pointless to the cause. Someone dies, they mourn for about 0.3 seconds then it's back to normal again. The entire ending just felt overly rushed and forced out. Like I said, there was so many different avenues to go down for the ending and this should not have been one of them. Very poor execution.Is it worth watching? Maybe, if you are running out of horror/thrillers to watch then stick it on. Like I said it's definitely not classed as a poor film, it is just massively let down by the second half of the film."

",0.5859,-0.9571,2019-01-19 00:00:00,7,"I didn't really know what to expect from this, I like that it was a bit more original of a plot than a lot of the stuff that I've seen lately. It relied less on jump scares and buckets of blood (although there is an autopsy going on so some might find that gory, but it's quite clinical) and more on building a general sense of unease and doom. I like that they allowed viewers to use their imaginations as opposed to just going for shock value. There were area that could have been better, such as a lot of the interactions between the dad and his son. There was zero discussion. Like when the son decides to burn the body and just dumps gasoline on it, saying nothing, the father also says nothing and just lights a match. Or when they found the cat mangled, not a word was said. There were no questions or exclamations, they simply walked to the insinerator and burned it. Idk, the way the two interacted was my least part. Also when the boy was crying over his gf being axed to death it came off very fake. Came off a little more convincing when the father died. Still, overall an enjoyable movie."

The situation is closed spaces with enough events driving the plot forward to its unexpected end. The performances come off realistic.

In my experience high expectations are often followed by disappointment. But in this case my expectations were met!This is actually a horror movie in difference from many other ""horror movies"" that are more splatter movies with focus on blood and gore in stead of actually being scary. The plot, twists, acting, sound quality, special effects and picture quality varied from good to great. The only things that could have made this movie better is if it had been longer with some elaborations regarding the background story for example. Elaborations around the beginning of the movie could be great as a prequel to this movie. The producers can have that idea from me for free on the condition that they make it into an equally great movie as this one ;-)"

It ratchets up the tension at times to very high levels, and the mystery of what exactly is going on was very engaging. Was I ultimately happy with the answers? Not entirely, but they did at least make sense within the context of the movie, and that counts for a lot.Even though the eventual conclusion of The Autopsy of Jane Doe was not exactly to my liking, I still enjoyed the movie overall.

" Great premise with faulty execution
",0.4215,0.4144,2019-01-04 00:00:00,5,"A coroner (Brian Cox) and his son/apprentice have been given one night to determine the cause of death of a young woman found buried in a house during the investigation of an apparently unrelated homicide. As the night wears on, they realize that this will be no ordinary autopsy.Clearly, there was a lot to work with here, and the first third of the film does a good job of setting the stage for what could have been a great mix of visual and psychological horror. For example, the writers cleverly used--or, more accurately, began to use--the fact that autopsies are often recoded on video as a narrative device to avoid the usual trope of experts explaining basic procedures to one another. But this approach was soon abandoned in favor of a standard, uninspired exposition.If the story were more carefully thought out, this narrative style wouldn't be a problem. The writers opted for a supernatural angle which wouldn't have been a problem if the explanation were fleshed out. Instread, the writers tacked on a shallow explanation in the last minutes of the film that doesn't make sense even with the suspension of disbelief and accepting the film's internal logic. There is no feeling of resolution at the end, as there are several rather important questions about why all of this had to occur in rhe first place.If you're looking for a film that delivers some scares and has a creep factor, however, this one does an okay job. I watch a lot of films in this genre and there were several occasions where I felt the scares. There are several jump scares, but not as many as the prosaic storyline might suggest."

" ""She can feel it...she wants us to feel it too""
",0.0,-0.963,2019-01-01 00:00:00,10,A young girl's body is found buried in a basement. She is found after the rest of the house was searched and 4 other bodies were discovered murdered. When one of the detectives was asked what her opinion was on the crime scene she said that it didn't look like someone was trying to get in...it looked like they were trying to get out. Dundundun-and so it starts.I've seen so many terrible horror films so I wasn't expecting much. Imagine my surprise when this turned out to be really good. I personally wouldn't categorize this as a horror film. I didn't find it scary just thoroughly engrossing. I was totally into this from start to finish. I didn't think it'd be possible to do an entire movie on an autopsy but it worked. There's a few jump scares but overall I think it did a good job of avoiding the usual horror fare. It just looked like a very believable scenario and they acted like I imagine any normal person would if they found themselves in that situation.I don't like the way Brian Cox looks but he is a good actor and so is Emile Hirsch. If lesser actors had been in these roles perhaps they wouldn't have been able to sell it like these guys. Brian Cox does the heavy lifting. He really mastered the whole autopsy thing. He looked like he actually knew what he was doing.I loved the use of the bell. So creepy and effective. I knew the minute I saw that bell that we'd hear it later.I was thinking that the body was a fake but except for some obvious scenes where they had to use a fake it was an actress. She did a heck of a job playing a corpse.I don't think the girlfriend was necessary. Could have done without her but then they wouldn't have had anyone to explain why they used the bell and they wouldn't have had someone to be axed by accident. THAT was the one thing that was not believable. They couldn't get out so how'd she get in? And why wasn't she calling for them or alerting them to her presence so they'd know it was her if she did find a way to get in?I wish there were more movies like this in general. I love a good suspense film and this delivered.If your idea of horror is blood and guts and gore - you'll get a tiny bit of that through the autopsy but mostly this is more atmospheric and psychological horror.This is one autopsy you'll want to sit in on.

" Refreshingly dreadful
",-0.4404,-0.9859,2018-12-30 00:00:00,10,"I think it has been said in many reviews already...this movie is an old school horror movie that builds its horror on unsettling atmosphere and not on predictable jump scares, screetches and cgi. I am a seasoned horror movie buff...I love the classics from the 70 's. There are still decent movies being made. The first Conjuring, the first Insidious, Innkeepers, Drag me to hell...to mention some more recent horror movies. But most of todays horror movies imo are generic trash...nonsensical movies with cheap jump scares, equally cheap cgi effects...and little else. Then this movie comes along...so refreshing. While I was watching it, I was somehow reminded of the master John Carpenter..think movies like The Thing and Prince of darkness. Its something very claustrophobic and dreadful about this movie that reminds me of those classics. The horror is mostly not seen...but u can sense that there is something sinister present...and there is no escaping. This movie really builds up the feeling of dread masterfuly. The director really did a great job. There was one scene in the movie I would like to point out (no spoiler)...the father in the movie is a strong and stoic character, not easily scared. But at one point in the movie he looks at his son and says in fear ""lets get out if here""...u can just feel the dread in that moment. The characters feel real...the way they act and behave. It feels real...and u feel with them as they realize they are trapped with something very dangerous. Great movie."

There were some jump scares thrown in, but what really had my heart racing was just the anticipation of what they would find next during this autopsy. I personally would have preferred her being an actual witch from the start, as opposed to Tommy's theory that she was innocent until she was tortured. While the idea that the pilgrims created what they feared by torturing an innocent is an interesting one and I do appreciate it, it just isn't my preference.I have to admit I absolutely loved the autopsy scenes in the beginning of the movie. It's the gore lover in me, what can I say?This is probably my favorite movie thus far depicting Christian-based witches, perhaps because of the lack of emphasis on the religion. I also liked that this movie was mostly shot in one location as it made the feeling of being trapped even more palpable. This movie teases you by making you expect something like the body to move or something more to appear in the hallway mirror and then it doesn't give it to you. The atmosphere here was as intimate as it was frightening.There was at least one glaring plot hole for me. How did Emma get down in morgue when Tommy and Austin were trapped? Did the witch let her in? Why? Emma hadn't ""tortured"" Jane Doe, so why attack her? Am I missing something?The ending was a bit of a let-down for me. As I've stated in previous posts I like for there to be at least some semblance of hope at the end. Also I could see a lot of the events coming during the climax, as well as the toe twitch at the end. All in all though it was a fun, interesting film and I would definitely recommend watching it at least once."

" Uncomfortable to watch, and thoroughly engrossing.
",-0.3818,0.9663,2018-11-22 00:00:00,8,"I do like slasher horror movies, but every once in a while I like to watch a movie that has little of the over saturated Hollywood action style horror movie aspects, instead favouring uncomfortable slow build methods. The story, lighting, character reactions/dialogue, and music, really worked for me whilst watching this movie. With slasher movies, I enjoy the ride by leaving my brain at the door, but this style of movie invades some of the more uncomfortable thoughts in your mind..... if you are prepared to let it.I notice that some viewers have complained that the character reactions were not believable. I often think that this is due to how difficult it is for movie makers to help audiences to suspend disbelief, as we all have seen too many movies. To help me to enjoy these kinds of movies, I try to project myself into the minds of the characters, using empathy. For me, this was easy to do, due to how well the characters were presented, and the initial set up. I imagine that working in a morgue would require practical, rational tendencies, the type of people that would be programmed to look for rational explanations, rather than freak out and bail at the first sight of something they could not explain.I would recommend watching this at night, and by yourself for best effect. I streamed it during the day. On the positive side though, it was a very windy day, and I did notice the creaks in the house, a door blow open, and my fan started turning due to an otherwise unnoticeable gust of wind..... or was it. Always a good sign that a movie has got under my skin."

" A Neat and Gory Horror Film That Doesn't Quite Know How to End
",-0.1779,0.969,2018-10-10 00:00:00,7,"Andre Ovredal, director of breakout international hit TROLLHUNTER, transitions neatly to US indie cinema, with this lithe and viscerally executed supernatural horror. Like all the best film's in this sub-genre, it is a battle between faith and rationality, in a very Blackwoodian mode. Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch are a father and son coroner team. Cox is patiently teaching Hirsch the intricacies of their business in a way that suggests he hopes his son will take over when he is no more. However, Hirsch has other hopes and other dreams... all of which are put on hold when a mysterious cadaver is dropped off late one stormy night.The set-up to the film is simply superb, and when Cox and Hirsch begin to conduct the autopsy on their Jane Doe, their is a great balance between horror and humour which I can only think of being bested by GET OUT from recent releases. The goriness of the autopsy is put in to relief by the matter-of-fact manner in which father and son go about their business. Things start to go awry when the duo are pulled outside of the autopsy room to attend to the free-roaming corpses of the recently deceased who have escaped captivity in the morgue's deep-freeze. At this stage the film slides into rather lazy jump scare terrain, a great shame as the final reveal is still a powerful one, and the set-up hints at a much richer film bubbling under the generic structure."

What I got was a suspense/horror film that was well acted and directed. The music tied right into the story and added an extra creepiness to it.

It's a suspensful, semi-slow burner, which really plays on the lores of what the antagonist in this film is capable of. 
I will say that i DIDNT like the ending, but can still appreciate that this film is scary throughout. I'd probably compare it to both of the blair witch films, in the sense that there comes a moment where the characters realise they're screwed & the suspense just keeps rising.

I had an inkling it would be admist the supernatural, but I didn't expect for it to be full on suspenseful horror/thriller.The film had a good premise and they started to work absolute wonders with it. But I do feel it started to peter out towards the end, unfortunately.The film's setting was the autopsy lab- that's it. I found this emersed you in the story even more, as you're not constantly swapping scenes; keeping your attention on the developing plot rather than the background. With this film it worked very well.The characters were minimal, which is best when it comes to suspeseful films- the less people there are on screen, the more unnerving it is for the viewer. I constantly found myself imaging myself in that situation: alone in a horror film- no thank you!The stories main focus is the autopsy of the Jane Doe (duh), which I found was the best part of the film. As they do the autopsy they find impossible things, and unexplainable things happen in the lab. The constant capture of the Jane Does face- eyes open, staring unblinkingly at the camera- everytime they discovered something, a light flickered, the radio tuned out to another channel, freaked me out! It was a superb way to unsettle the audience and to make them aware that she is no ordinary dead body that the forensic scientists are performing an autopsy on.The last half hour is where it was no longer scary, but rather predictable and anti-climatic. I can't delve into the details as it will spoil the ending for yourself.I do, despite the disappointing ending, recommend this film to anyone who loves a good suspense fuelled film, as the majority of the film was strong. It really puts you on edge. Makes your skin crawl, and plays on your mind."

It's filmed in a single location and you get familiar with it from the start, which is really nice, as it sets up the mood for the rest of the movie almost immediately. Main actors did an excellent job with their roles and you get a very good view of their background as they unfold the main story layer by layer. Never drags on, it's very creepy and one of the best horror movies of the last decade."

" Good film.
",0.4404,-0.8289,2018-07-21 00:00:00,7,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe is an interesting horror movie; it's a drama set in a morgue shared by a father and son working together on the same cases. However, things take a turn for the worst when an unknown woman, whom they simply referred to as 'Jane Doe', is delivered to the morgue; and this corpse is unlike anything else they've ever seen before.For a horror movie that's come out against a back-drop including the likes of The Conjuring 1 & 2, The Cabin in the Woods and The Babadook, Jane Doe is surprisingly competent in spite of the occasional cliches that are in the movie: like a character going into a room, false alarm and then *boom* jump-scare. In this case I can forgive it because they're more supernatural oriented scares anyway, and it helps the film build atmosphere of its own.Jane Doe is a 3.5/5 case."

As they delve deeper and deeper, they discover a series of bizarre clues that point to a bone-chilling conclusion.In a genre saturated with mediocre movies, supernatural horror The Autopsy of Jane Doe stands out as a superbly crafted creepfest that delivers nerve-jangling shivers, while providing enough graphic gruesomeness for those who enjoy more visceral thrills.The film starts out as a fascinating study of a rather revolting vocation, as Tommy and Austin systematically dissect the 'Jane Doe' looking for answers, with director André Øvredal lovingly capturing every sloppy detail of the process. Things start to get seriously creepy once the pair start to reveal the truth about the woman's past, all the evidence pointing to the unthinkable, the action ultimately entering the realms of the fantastic.Øvredal expertly cranks up the suspense, using his shadowy morgue setting to great effect, gradually introducing more and more unsettling elements guaranteed to leave the viewer with sweaty palms and on the edge of their seat (there's something about a reanimated corpse with its eyes and mouth sewn shut that really gets the heart a-pounding, although its the simple sound of a ringing bell that generates maximum tension).Best watched alone at night with the lights out and the doors open, The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a good old-fashioned scary horror that rarely puts a foot wrong, and in these days, that's something to be celebrated."

",0.0,-0.7576,2018-06-13 00:00:00,8,"Impressive and very scary. It is particularly good for the first half when all manner of ideas are being thrown about whilst we try and understand what could have happened. The Jane Doe looks good all the time and is a constant reminder that something very bad has taken place. It is nice that we are asked to switch allegiances during the film but I would have liked to have left the basement once or twice. A little more exposition as to where the girl was found and the circumstances and/or more revelations of possible origins to the clearly sinister happenings. As it is it is pretty claustraphobic and just a tiny bit disappointing the way things turn out after such an horrific first half or so. Mind you, imperfect it may be but you won't be able to tear yourself away, even though you may want to."
" One of the best modern horror films
",0.128,0.9726,2018-06-11 00:00:00,8,"The autopsy of Jane DoeThe movie starts with the grisly discovery of a murder scene in a residential home which leaves the local sheriff wondering what happened as it appears that there's no sign of forced entry into the property but instead it appears the occupants were actually trying to escape..Next the body of a young woman is uncovered in the basement half buried but with no injuries at all. The sheriff then has to rush the body to the local mortuary for a father and son team to conduct an autopsy to get the cause of death for this woman. It would now be unfair of me to say anymore about what happens. The beauty of this film is that the mystery of how this woman died unravels for the audience at the same time as the characters on screen this is expertly done using the autopsy as a device for doing this. The film makers have a ball as they throw in some decent jump scares as well as some genuinely terrifying scenes to help progress the story. The film is directed by André Ovredal who also directed the Troll Hunter film and he proves himself to be a competent horror director here. There is a very small cast here which adds to the claustrophobic mood, the father and son team are played by a wonderful Brian Cox as dad and Emile Hirsch as the son who is also very good in this. Both performances keep the viewer engaged and interested in the characters as the movie runs at a compact 1hr 26mins there's not much time to get to know much about them. Some have criticised the length has being too short but in an era of overly bloated movies I think this runs at an ideal length and it runs at a great pace.In summary I'd say this is one of the better horror movies in recent years, it is an original idea with decent scares and great performances from our leads and excellent direction. It is available in most areas on Netflix where I think it will find an audience that will appreciate it."

I didn't feel bored throughout all of it, the pace was nice and the scares were not only made from cliches like suddenly appearing thing in your face. Mostly the tension gave me the fells and it did a very good job. I liked the symmetry of the beginning of the movie and the ending of it.

" Chilling
",-0.0258,0.991,2018-06-02 00:00:00,7,"'The Autopsy of Jane Doe' is a chilling and suspenseful film, but falls short of being great due to it's tasteless climax. Director André Øvredal uses his limited setting well and creates a great claustrophobic feeling that immerses it's audience into the mystery of the film. The two leading actors both portray their characters well, and have a great father-son chemistry that helps bring the story alive. While the first half is very compelling and suspenseful, the film loses it's audience when the cliches start rolling in. While Øvredal had great potential with the original plot line he never really reached greatness. He set up the viewers for a plot twist that was rather unsatisfying. Then, predictable cliches and cheap jump scares were added in to make it worse. However, despite my negativity on the last half of this film, overall it was still quite good. The suspenseful first half was definitely unsettling and the mystery was very intriguing. It was made very well, with great directing on Øverdal's part. Had the ending to this movie went a little further, then this would have been one hell of a horror movie."

The joints broken has no bruises or exit wounds. It was very good. It started out as a mystery and turned into a very scary supernatural horror movie. Suspenseful, smart and scary.

André Øvredal gives us a magnificent piece of modern horror that he had not seen for years.
The first half of the film is based solely on the creation of the atmosphere that will accompany us throughout the film. Claustrophobic, cold and lonely. The horror is based on not knowing, it does not show us evil, we have to intuit it and that causes greater helplessness. The BSO, the script and above all the direction and editing are outstanding, both for a film of this genre and for the rest.
In short, an essential movie for lovers of the genre and highly recommended for all the people."

While examining the body of the unidentified woman, they start to experience supernatural phenomenons leading to the anonymous woman's enigmatic death.The whole film takes place in a single location, the coroner's office where the two perform their examinations, turning it into a bottle movie.

",0.0,0.9765,2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe film starts of with a bang. It is grisly, graphic, and gory. The story is intriguing, interesting, and original. The film keeps the tension high and makes the mystery unknowable. The autopsy part of the film is graphic and detailed. This helps keep the film feeling like it is real. The ritualistic part of the film is eerie and creepy. The ending is haunting and stunning.The acting is superb. Brain Cox delivers a stunning performance. He usually is a side character in most of his movies but he takes the helm in this film with such power and emotion. He is truly an underrated actor. Emile Hirsch also delivers a good performance. His acting was slightly weaker than Brain Cox's and I felt that Cox overpowered him in many scenes. Although some might think it is far fetched calling it acting, Olwen Catherine Kelly portrays Jane Doe very well. She is creepy and has an omnipresent aura surrounding her. Ophelia Lovibond and Michael McElhatton both have small parts but do add to the story.The pacing is very fast. I felt that the story lost some power when they are first looking for a way out of the morgue but it picks up towards the end. The runtime is short.Pros: Grisly, graphic, and gory story, a great ending, the autopsy part of the film was great, amazing acting by Brain Cox, good overall acting, fast pacing, and a short runtimeCons: The story losses some power in the middle, Emile Hirsch was overpowered by Brain Cox in some scenes, and some parts of the story are left unansweredOverall Rating: 8.3P.S. This is a very good horror film. I would highly recommend it to any horror film fans."
" So Much Potential But Then...
",0.0,-0.9545,2018-03-15 00:00:00,7,"I can't recall how I came upon this film, but can honestly say, for the most part, I'm glad I did. It offers something few other films I've seen have, which is horrifying mystery through the eyes of coroners. Many users have written good overviews of the plot, so I'll give you the 10,000' version and then my opinion.The movie is about an unidentified body discovered in the basement of house where multiple murders have taken place. The body is sent to the local coroner, who works out of his house, along with his apprentice son. As the father and son perform the autopsy, strange and insidious happenings occur.I liked the film right up until the ending (!SPOILERS FROM HERE ON!). For such a great plot and good suspense, I thought it fell short of its potential. For example, the dad allows Jane Doe to trade her physical pain and injury with his healthy body, thereby taking some of his life force. Yet, the dad does not lose his tongue and can still speak. Jane Doe also does not take everything from the father, otherwise he would be instantly dead, as his organs replaced those of Jane Doe's which decomposed. And Jane Doe does also not live up to her end of the bargain, instead killing the son. I think a much better ending would have been her draining the father of everything until he dies and then, slowly, lifting herself up off the autopsy table and walking over the son, whereby she heals the rest of herself while killing him. Then she would walk right out into the sun outside, with that odd song playing. The next scene would have the sheriff arriving and, once again, find himself dumbfounded as to what happened. After going through all the corpse lockers, he would ask, ""Where's the Jane Doe?' Then the film would cut to Jane Doe walking down the side of the road and hitching a ride (with an ominous smile for the camera)."

This nameless body isn't just any anonymous individual...oh no no, we have ourselves a mysterious corpse that's wrapped up in an enigma (literally...). A murder mystery that quickly transcends into typical horror tropes. The scares that were conjured up were effective I must say. Some really good camera techniques involving reflections, slow zooming in on dark crevices and prolonged static shots of Jane Doe who, may I just say, makes me incredibly uncomfortable. That's one thing I can compliment, the creepy atmosphere and intrigue is well crafted. The plot has me both on edge and mystified. Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch gave consistent performances with plenty of character development. I admired the on screen chemistry which assisted in the likability of these two individuals. I became invested. Any horror film to do that is worth a watch. Good use of prosthetics and gore as well. The first act was well paced and continuously increased the terror in a rather subtle away. An innovative concept. How did she die? Why did she die? Who even is she? But then...then the third act arrives at it just becomes so convoluted! Urgh, I thought the plot was more intelligent than that! Supernatural occurrences soon wreak havoc in the morgue and a few unpredictable yet unbelievable instances happen that made me immediately shout ""nope, that doesn't make sense!"". The smart script then dissolves into exposition and constant reminders of what discoveries have been found within the autopsy so far...y'know, in case we forgot. Then the final scenes play out and it's just so formulaic and dumb. Really disappointed with the third act, the plot just couldn't maintain its subtlety that made the first act legitimately creepy. A few unnecessary jump scares, but on the whole an effective horror mystery. Just forget about the last 30 minutes...wait make that 40 minutes."
" THE BEST HORROR FILM IN 20 YEARS
",0.128,-0.9655,2018-02-26 00:00:00,9,"The Autopsy Of Jane Doe is a masterful little movie that asks its viewer to truly be immersed in its horror and atmosphere. The stapled location of a morgue has a wonderful contrast on the main characters' backstories as well as the central gritty tone. The clever use of red signifies the sinister presence of this movie and instantly you are permeated into the experience. It is an experience that is very reminiscent of ""The Thing"", in the way that John Carpenter creates a visceral vibe using every advantage he has. Andre Ovredal does the same thing with his location of a morgue, which allows freeways to many wonderfully spooky sequences, and because of this, the tension never once wavers. In my book, this is the best horror film since Scream, which was a game-changer in the sense where it was parodying the horror genre but also managed to be a brilliant stand-alone horror film itself. The Autopsy Of Jane Doe is a game changer in the way it defines horror. Horror can come from anything. An idea. A location. Literally anything. This film is built up of classic horror, horror that relies on mood and location, instead of random jump scares that are bashed into the skull. This is ""The Thing"" of today, but preferably, even better."

Movies are more than the some of their parts, and also, occasionally, less than. Like the corpse at its centre, the various parts of ""Autopsy"" add up to something, and you're not really sure what.Allow me to explain: the movie concerns the titular autopsy of a young woman whose cause of death cannot be explained. The autopsy just reveals one surprising discovery, again and again and again, until it becomes a little ridiculous.The corpse is eventually discovered to have occult significance, and then the movie takes a turn into more typical horror movie territory, with a cat-and-mouse game and some predictable bloodshed.It does, however, have some effective moments, which is why I wanted to like ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" more. It just didn't come together as well as it might have. For all the time spent exploring the body , and all the exciting (and repetitive) discoveries made within it, I didn't feel like the central premise was explained well enough to cause the dread I felt the ending should have generated. The autopsy just goes on for too long, with too many clues deadening the impact. Most movies miss the mark. This one hits a mark, I'm just not sure which."

I have been to Salem and I think it is a cool place but to make this into a witch cliche was probably not a good idea. It would have been more creepy if the monster had been sort of unclear like in It Follows. Morever, it seems strange that scientists would react like these guys did. Brian Cox did a good job and also in Ring American version. The other guy played it a bit like Nightwatch (a movie that takes place in a similar location). However, towards the end of the movie there was too little to work with and it had collapsed (a bit like Cure for Wellness) into Hollywood cliches."

" A failed attempt of mixing two genres
",-0.5106,-0.6229,2018-01-22 00:00:00,6,"Alright. Pretty good cinematography, decent acting. We could say that this movie is divided in two parts : 1. The mystery and 2. the Horror. The keyword, here, is DIVIDED. You can realy feel the artificial shift that happens from mystery to horror in the middle of the movie. 
It's not smooth at all, in fact it's really disappointing to abandon the inquiry of Jane Doe's autopsy who promised a lot of interesting questions. All of this strange facts from Jane's body build up a tremendous curiosity from the spectator...and then nothing. 
Really, nothing. The movie just dives into horror and you found yourself watching some jumpscares like a 12 years old teenager trying to impress his friends. There was so much potential. You could do an Edgar Allan Poe's atmosphere, for example, rationalizing what appeared to be witchraft. Would have been interesting. 
Just saying. TLDR; feels like two movies artificially merged into one. Failed mix between mystery and horror. 
I don't really recommend."

I need not have worried - this film is not particularly scary. There are maybe two or three instances where I became semi-startled, but nothing those with a weak heart need fear.Truth is, I had the plot sussed after about 20 minutes. Anybody who watches a lot of ""horror"" movies will recognize the themes. It's not a bad film by any means, but this genre has been covered every which way and there is nothing original or exciting here. For the most part it's a little creepy at best, with very few stand-out moments.For the most part it's a well-crafted film with nice cinematography and special effects. Some of Brian Cox's acting is, surprisingly, quite poor - this is definitely not his genre. His attempts at portraying pain come across as mild indigestion or wind. I think he's better when he's the scarer, not the scareee.Nice looking film let down by a weak script and familiar plot."

It gets you asking questions right off the bat, the body is found in the basement of this house half buried but her skin is porcelain white unblemished, when she arrives at the morgue there is not a spot of dirt on her nothing and she was brought direct from the murder scene. Begs the questions the cops who dug her out didn't question why dirt didn't stick to her.So she dropped off at the morgue for them to uncover cause of death and this is where it drags you in, it is gripping from the first slice. I worked out when they dragged out the cloth with the tooth wrapped in it what she was and what year she had died and where. But the reveals are handled well, especially the tattoos on the inside of her skin that was pretty awesome.From then it was into the standard horror/suspense scenes but again handled well enough, this is worth a watch and you won't be disappointed"

And, man, it was well worth it! This is a bit of an odd, quirky horror movie, set in a real uncomfortable place; an old funeral home/coroner's office, with some great gutwrenching twists and great acting. The end part is not how you think it will go down, and in a dark room at night, you'll be sitting on edge just about all the way through."
" This is Horror to the Truest Sense
",-0.2023,-0.9921,2018-01-05 00:00:00,9,"When I first came upon this movie, I had expected it to be a casual horror movie with no real ghost, just a bunch of blood and gore with sprinkles of curious mysteries. How wrong could I be since I got scared halfway through that I finally asked my sister to re-watch it together. I usually only watch jumpscare-type horror with my sister just for the fun of it (because it's more fun watching together), but this one is different.If you are expecting jumpscare, go find another movies. This one is psychological horror through and through. You can't help but think along the movie as to what would happen next. It's scary, but not the one that'll make you scream, but the one that'll make your back shudder when you realize that you're watching it alone or maybe in the dark of your room, when you're trying and failing to sleep after watching this one hell of a horror movie and being haunted by images from it. Even my sister and I cringed behind our pillows just in case something jumped out of the screen and pounced on us, lol.Some reviews might say that this movie is 'stupid' or 'unrealistic', but is there any horror movies that are 'realistic'? Blegh, this is movie, babies, it's a gateway to the unreal world as a break from your way-too-realistic life. True, some things might left unexplained by the end of the movie, but I believe it's the director's intention to left the viewer's wondering about what is the deal with this Jane Doe, and so on, so on. Maybe you can even connect the dots yourself and formulate a plausible explanation? That's the real thrill of watching any genre of movies, not just some shock and awe or cheap jumpscares that are scary at the time but fades away as the time goes. I don't think anyone's able to erase Jane Doe's glassy eyes from their memories ever. Don't get me wrong, I like jumpscare when I want some quality time with my sisters and we'll watch something easy to digest while we binge-eat snacks and choked on a bar of chocolate when something jumped out of the dark. But when you watch this, you'll find yourself unable to swallow your food because your throat tightens at some intense moment of horror.I'm not going to say more than this, lest I would spoil the fun... errr... the horror of this masterpiece. You should go watch it yourself. But do heed to Stephen King: ""Watch it, but not alone.""In conclusion, if you're a casual horror fan, this movie might prove to be too much for you. But if you like suspense and psychological thriller, this is for you. You have to use your brain to watch this movie otherwise you might ended up bored like some bad reviewers here. Cheers."

This is the story of Father and son coroners who must perform an immediate autopsy on a ""Jane Doe"" corpse found in the basement of a home where a family was killed. However, they are attacked by supernatural forces as they examine the extent of her injuries.
If you like your gore in a horror film then you might just like this but its just the gore from the autopsy and there is very little horror to speak of. The story is just silly and it's pretty easy to predict what is going to happen next because it's just so formulaic as a lot of horror movies are.

I havent found a great horror in a long time and believe me, I am always looking. I am a major fan of the descent and I love this film.

" mostly positive
",0.5574,-0.9488,2017-12-17 00:00:00,8,"It had a great concept and kept a low, creeping profile, focusing the majority of the film on an autopsy on a body that is disturbingly well preserved, while internally is a disgusting horrifying wreck.
I feel that the creepiness of the body being clearly abnormal in a potentially sci-fi/supernatural sort of way could've carried the film on its own, but the genre it chose (Horror) would demand more action and terror on top of that, so there are horror sequences with occasional jump scares and implication of haunting.the revelation at the end seems to me to be something that might be controversial, with some viewers thinking it incredibly stupid or awesome. Personally I thought it could've used just a bit more insight, but at the same time realizing that too much exposition or fixating on the reveal might ruin it.
without spoiling, the ending was a significant let down compared to the rest of the film, but it wasn't enough to sink the film, making it definitely worth viewing"
" Mounting atmosphere, disappointing finale

This film begins with a nearly suffocating claustrophobic atmosphere, one in which the outside world can't possibly exist and there's only the starkly lit mildewy wooden paneled interior of an old family morgue. The mystery mounts and the two leads examine an inexplicable body, one in which they can't find a cause of death. The body is untouched and yet her insides show unbelievable trauma.The mounting atmosphere and tension of the first half is unfortunately mishandled in the second half. The film becomes a rather bare-bones spooky jump scare exercise that leads to a shocking revelation that really does deliver (it's genuinely intriguing and so much more could have been done with it) on the first half's tension. There's no follow through.There are great ideas here but a lack of focus in the middle, or maybe a fear that if jumps in the night didn't start happening soon the audience would get bored. It's the complete opposite."

I've seen lots of films that weren't scary and a disappointment, but this one has a new spin and it's a little stressful. I won't tell you anything about it, because the intro to this film lets you assume they'll follow the traditional story line path. In some respects, this film was a new take on horror just like 'It Follows'. The horror genre needs new ideas and I'm glad some people are willing to try. I really want a sequel to this film. But it only made $6 million because it was released 4 days before Christmas. And who wants to watch an Autopsy before Christmas day."
" Claustrophobia (as in Horror)

And the only thing I knew was that very vivid poster. I didn't even see the cast list (Brian Cox? Very nice). So watching this without any real input, I could enjoy this (or be frightened by it) as much as possible.The acting is really good, which was to be expected with the people attached. Obviously there is nudity, though not titillating (at least it is not meant to be). And while there is horror, this tries not to score points with gore, but rather with an atmosphere it builds. The story may be slim, but the setting is so crystal clear, that you get into the mood and the mindset of the people involved. It really messes you up, in a really good way.

" Manages to rise above the bad horror movie
",-0.802,0.9686,2017-11-27 00:00:00,7,"Horror movies aren't known for their artistic quality, or common sense...or subtlety. However, this movie has just enough quality to rise above the muddy pool of bad horror movies. It still fails to stay sensible all the way though, but I suppose you can't have it all.A mysterious body is found and a father-and-son team of medical examiners start uncovering weird things about it. That's the basic story, but the story is really not this movie's strong suit. In fact, as the movie progresses, the events make increasingly less sense. The ending helps explain some of it but not all. The movie tries not to draw attention to the imperfections in the story by simply not addressing certain questions and keeping things a mystery, which is a smart thing that more sci- fi movies should do. What this movie does quite well is establish and follow through. A number of items and characters are established and all of those scenes are not for nothing because they pay off at some point later on.The movie scored Brian Cox as one of the lead actors, and he does a very good job at bringing life to this film. The movie invests time into establishing the relationships between him and his son and between his son and the son's girlfriend. It also takes its time to show the characters of the two main leads and the difference between them. This helps the viewer care.Taking the time to establish its characters and story beats and then following up on the promises made, helps this movie feel alive.Although this movie can't help itself and starts giving you cheap jump scares, there aren't too many of them, and the movie isn't that gory either (well, autopsies aren't gory to me). The movie relies on suspense and mystery to keep your attention. Because of this, and the medical aspect of it, this movie feels like an episode of X-Files, and just like many of the X-Files episodes, it asks you to not think that hard about everything you see and hear, as you start wondering if the story couldn't have been organised more effectively and with less running time."

" Witches -- Forgotten But Not Gone.
",-0.1154,-0.9406,2017-11-22 00:00:00,5,"I was kind of hoping for a mystery. Okay. An autopsy. I expected the coroner or pathologist to uncover indication that the death was not was it seemed and this would lead to a policier in which the mystery of Jane Doe's death was unraveled and a villain manacled. Instead I got a zombie movie.The first hour or so is fine. The body of Jane Doe is brought in and the police officer says they need a cause of death by tomorrow. Brian Cox -- a good actor -- and Emile Hirsch play father and son coroners who aren't disturbed by chopping up and sawing at human remains. The autopsy shown is reasonably accurate. Cox does a decent job and follows the usual pattern, though he doesn't sniff the stomach contents, which is part of the ritual -- a ritual I'd be happy enough to ignore. In the autopsy I viewed, the face of the corpse was covered by a cloth, removing some of his humanity. I'm glad they didn't cover up Jane Doe's face. She's played by Olwen Kelly -- if ""played"" is the right word. She neither moves nor utters a sound. She makes an awfully good impression without them.Hirsch begins to suspect something is up when they begin extracting various exotic objects from the stomach -- Jimson weed (a hallucinogen), some kind of odd scroll, and on to other signs that this is a most unusual cadaver. In fact, it's not quite a cadaver yet, and whatever it is, it's highly miffed at the two guys whacking away at it, so PO'd that it causes all sorts of things to happen that logic is left behind in the dust -- or the peat, in this instance.There's a terrific thunderstorm, the radio sizzles for a moment and begins to play a song call ""Let the Sun Shine"" or something. The lights go out. Flashlights appear. The doors are locked and the elevator doesn't work. So father and son are locked in a morgue with a corpse that's animating the spirit world. It's a rather large morgue with a maze of hallways. The men are trying to escape the menace by hiding in the elevator with an ax. A figure approaches in the darkness and the flickering light reveals a decomposing old lady. The terrified Cox hacks it with a fire ax. It turns out to be Hirsch's girl friend, who expires bloodily on the floor.How Ophelia Lovibond managed to get into the morgue when all the doors were locked and the men couldn't leave, and why she approached silently and menacingly in the darkness without shouting a greeting is -- well, it's positively mystifying. So are a lot of other things -- doors opening and closing by themselves, voices from outside imitating the police, and the dead cat. So, after all this Schweinerei, do the guys manage to destroy the witch or at least appease the corpse? Nope. They both die, and the police, wanting to get rid of this odd body, have it shipped far away for burial somewhere else.I just got a whiff of a perfume whose base is cadaverine. Yes. I think I recognize it. It's called ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe II."""

The body becomes the center of attention as it is moved into the autopsy room and investigated by two men trained in the investigation and analysis of the dead. The two main actors, Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch, relate well to each other as the investigations begins to turn up clues that increase the tension and bring on a deeper mystery. Oh, did I mention that there's a storm outside? Yeah, you can hear it from the morgue basement of this building that seems to contain all the accoutrements of a modern dissection lab but when you pass through the access doors suddenly turns much older and creepier complete with air vents that echo and a convenient incinerator. But the center of this movie does not hold. The clues portray impossible conditions, and then the movie brings on impossible events. But there are no surplus characters to kill, as such, so the mystery deepens and these main characters get tossed around, but they are still with us. It is hard not to mention events that are spoilers, but the events were not satisfactory. Towards the end one of the characters comes up with a theory of what has been happening, but this comes out of a writer's efforts to tie up very loose ends without benefit of a movie reveal. Conclusion: An attempt at providing creeping creepiness which goes not awry but off key. Did I mention the corpse is good looking?"

The movie hangs together very well, doesn't strain credulity, has competent actors doing their jobs well and is inventive and creative. This is old-style movie-making, almost like film noir. The only criticism I have is the existence of the girlfriend. Cut her out and stick with the crux of the story.

" Fun time at the morgue
",0.5106,-0.9926,2017-11-20 00:00:00,6,"""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" is a 2016 horror film that is not long at all, easily clocks in before the 90-minute mark and this is perhaps the most known career effort by the two writers here. It is an English-language film of course directed by Norwegian André Øvredal and it is still his most recent release, even if he has new stuff coming out soon. I personally really loved his Trollhunter film and I must say his take on Jane Doe did not reach the same level of quality, at least not as a whole, even if there were some really special moments in here. Cox and Hirsch will certainly be known and recognized by film buffs and it's fitting that these two as the biggest names in here basically turn this film into a two-man show as they are in it from beginning to end. Maybe you could say three-man show because Olwen Catherine Kelly giving one of the hottest corpse performances of all time is visible all the time too and makes quite an impact while doing nothing actually except lying there.So yeah the two doctors get the corpse of a young woman and they are told that they have to find out what happened to her, what they determine as the cause of death. But the further they dive in the mystery, the more and more strange things keep happening. And a lot of it is really effective from the horror scare factor perspective. I think the middle part of these 85 minutes is perhaps the best, everything before and after that is okay too, but not great. I just love locked door horror and radio voices horror, gets me every time. Sadly, the final revelation and explanation of who this Jane Doe is and what happened to her did not turn out to my preference really, even if I kinda like realistic unhappy endings like this one here. A bit of a pity. The last shot was not to my liking either as it felt really rushed in. But the good news is that there is really all the opportunity for a sequel with how this one turned out in the end.The weakest moment of the film was perhaps the girlfriend's death and sadly the character as a whole could have been left out in my opinion. And why would he throw his weapon away? But these are only some cons here. I still think the acting, script, camera work and general premise work out well for the most part. There were a few moments where I was indeed scared and they entertained me nicely from start to finish. The location, i.e. the morgue, was a very good choice and as the gateway between life and death made sure the film delivered from the perspective of atmosphere constantly. All in all, I can see why this one received such a great deal of awards recognition. It shows that traditional horror films that go completely without comedy moments are not dead yet. (No pun intended.) Even I as somebody who has many genres he prefers over horror ended up liking this one quite a lot, so for horror film lovers it is a must-see although I am sure that they have seen the film already anyway as it did not go under the radar at all. In case I am wrong about you, then what are you waiting for? Go check it out now."

The Autopsy of Jane Doe (2016) doesn't have a complicated story, but is creepy and compelling enough to rise above its peers.Coroner Tommy Tilden (Brian Cox) and his son Austin (Emile Hirsch) run a routine practice in a small town morgue, but the discovery of the pale, lifeless body of a black-haired woman (Olwen Catherine Kelly) in a murdered family's basement changes all that. Austin has plans to take his girlfriend Emma (Ophelia Lovibond) to the movies, but something doesn't feel right when the sheriff wheels in a fresh corpse from a crime scene, so he postpones the date.As Tommy and Austin begin the autopsy on the mysterious woman, they uncover clues to how she died. All her injuries are internal, and they discover evidence that she's much, much older than she appears. The more they cut into her, however, the more unsettling events begin to manifest around the morgue. Something unseen traps and pursues them, with predictable results.It's eventually revealed Jane Doe was a witch who was brutally tortured and magically bound in a prison of her own flesh in seventeenth-century New England. She inflicted torment on everyone who had custody of her body, so it was shuttled around until ending up in the morgue, where only Tommy and Austin had the tools and expertise to solve the mystery.Although the historical premise is interesting, I was disappointed the filmmakers didn't focus more on the relationship between Tommy and his son. Early in the film, Tommy appears to be nearing retirement and hopes Austin will follow in his footsteps (although coroners are usually elected). Austin is caught between loyalty to his father and starting a new life with Emma. The violent deaths of everyone involved means this conflict is never resolved. It adds depth to the characters but ultimately leaves the audience feeling like something is missing.Autopsy is reminiscent of Deadgirl (2008), which had a similar if less clinical premise. In Deadgirl, two teen boys discover the nude body of a woman chained in the basement of an abandoned asylum. After discovering she is alive, they soon also discover she apparently can't die. Both films appeal to a certain morbid voyeurism and raise questions about the male fascination with the female form. Both feature two men cutting into and otherwise freely manipulating an imprisoned and otherwise helpless woman's body.In Autopsy, the woman is a witch. In Deadgirl, she is some kind of zombie. Both eventually lash out at their captors, inflicting torment and death in retribution. It's implied the suffering of these men is justified under lex talionis–""law of retaliation""–in which their punishment corresponds in kind and degree to the woman's injury. Quite literally in the case of Jane Doe, the exact injuries she suffered are magically inflicted on Tommy the coroner.Brian Cox and Olwen Catherine Kelly's performances are largely responsible for The Autopsy of Jane Doe's success. Brian Cox, an Emmy Award-winning Scottish actor, has had a prolific career and brings warmth and nuance to his role. Olwen Catherine Kelly, an Irish model, isn't an experienced actress, has no lines, and doesn't even move in her role as Jane Doe, but the fact she is able to play a convincing corpse without CGI is remarkable in itself. André Øvredal thought a dummy or prosthetics would appear fake to audiences, so he used as little as possible.Overall, The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a solid horror flick that isn't pointlessly grotesque or reliant on jump scares. It adheres to the KISS principle of filmmaking: Keep It Simple, Stupid. A simple premise, a few key characters, and a single mystery means this film avoids many pitfalls common to the genre."
" Incredibly creepy and disturbing little movie
",-0.552,0.8671,2017-11-09 00:00:00,7,"There aren't very many horror movies that have either scared, disturbed, or creeped me out, and I've seen a lot of them. The few exceptions were the ""IT"" remake, ""Dolly Dearest"" and the first ""Child's Play"" (as a child). Than, this movie came along and joined the list. It is extremely graphic, and some moments are just downright creepy, but it is very well acted, and all those involved with the movie did an excellent job of building up a sense of dread and terror with this. It takes a little while to get fully into, but once you do, you will definitely enjoy this."
" A palpable sense of dread
",-0.4588,0.9642,2017-11-04 00:00:00,10,"This starts so wonderfully slowly and builds so ingeniously that when it really starts to move you have no choice but to go with it.It's gory but with such a title, should u be surprised. It's intelligent in its plotting and never lowers itself to an easy plot device. At almost the exact half way point it steps up the story into sheer supernatural terror and it works thanks to its intricate and smart build up.For true fans of horror driven by ideas first and blood second, enjoy!"

" Jane, or whatever her name is, doesn't like to be fondled!
",-0.3404,-0.9952,2017-11-01 00:00:00,7,"""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" features one giant and massive strongpoint that immediately makes all the flaws and shortcomings (and also the rest of this user-comment) utterly unimportant and redundant, namely: it's genuinely and old-fashioned SCARY! I guarantee that, even for an experienced genre fanatic like me, this film has moments that will make your blood pump faster and the hairs in the back of your neck rise! It's a claustrophobic, visceral and excruciatingly tense horror story like we haven't seen one in years. While the suspense and mystery keeps on mounting and mounting, the actual plot remains unpredictable until the very end. It promises to become a long night for Tommy and Austin Tilden; father and son, but also both coroners in a sleepy Virginian town. The local Sheriff brings in the corpse of a beautiful young girl that was recovered from a nasty but unsolved murder scene. He needs to know the cause of death by morning, and thus the Tildens begin to professionally dissect the girl. While a violent thunderstorm rages outside (works all the time), they learn that Jane Doe suffered from numerous fractures, wounds and damaged organs that could have caused her death, but strangely enough her corpse is fully intact. ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" is a very qualitative production. André Øvredal, writer/director of the best found-footage film ever with ""Trollhunter"", creates an intensified atmosphere, both Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch demonstrate powerful performances and the horror is REAL with an eerie assortment of morgue footage. Of course, the film isn't sheer brilliance. At a certain point the script obviously has to come with answers and clarifications and, as sadly too often the case, the denouement is weaker than the building up towards. I won't immediately refer to the film as an instant classic, like many others are doing, but it's nonetheless a highly recommended viewing for, say, Halloween."

This film proves that you don't need much to produce horror in your head, just a good story, good actors and a good cinematographer.You can't look away, you always want to know what happens next.

Brian Cox is a standout, but overall, everyone played their character brilliantly, I feel for them, even for Jane Doe.the autopsy is pretty ""gory"", so if you can't stand blood or human organs, I don't recommend you watch this movie."
" Not as good.
",-0.3412,-0.9522,2017-09-30 00:00:00,3,"To be honest, the Autopsy of Jane Doe is not so good, it's predictable along the way. Also, I hate the fact that they had to kill an animal and show it for shock value. Not good at all. Plus, the jump-scares make it worse because they make the movie cheap. Finally, there is no real closure in this film, if you see the ending you will find that to be a fact. There's tension though, so I'll give them that. I give it a 4 out of ten, just for the idea and the tension moments. This could have gone so much better."
" A great atmospheric horror
",0.1027,0.9894,2017-09-27 00:00:00,7,"This movie fell on my radar from a result of my Amazon browsing history. I'm not sure what messed up little algorithm determined that I'm down with autopsies, but I'm okay with it. Emile Hirsch is the son of a coroner (Brian Cox, who I cannot un-see as Captain O'Hagan in Super Troopers) that is reluctant to carry on the family business. A mysterious corpse is discovered and sent to the father/son duo for an autopsy. This is where the real story begins and as good of a place as any for me to begin my spoiler-free dissection of The Autopsy of Jane Doe.The Good: First of all, I hate Emile Hirsch. I don't know if it's his face or that I first saw him in The Girl Next Door which for reasons I won't go into here, I also hated. Even with that, all the characters in this were very likable. I was shocked to find myself sympathizing with him throughout the movie and wanting him to run off with his girlfriend. Brian Cox played a wonderful role in being the stern yet understanding father. These two come off as natural being paired as father and son, which shows some excellent casting decisions. The way that the two communicate with each other feels completely real and like a normal exchange between an experienced coroner and his novice son. Also, kudos Olwen Kelly, who played Jane Doe and laid naked on a table for what I'm sure was quite a good while.The story is a healthy mix of mystery, suspense and horror that becomes darker the more it unfolds. If you haven't read any other reviews or heard anything about the film from anyone else, you'll probably find yourself guessing what's going on until near the end. The mystery in this film isn't so concealed that you won't figure it out from what they uncover, but it's still a little bit of thought you'll have to put in.The atmosphere left nothing to be desired. It's dark, dreary and rainy – Everything you want to experience in a horror movie. Which lends itself well to the overall creepiness of a morgue. It also didn't rely on jump scares which they could have easily done with the atmosphere of a morgue. It was refreshing to see them take the more psychological approach to this movie rather than the popular approach of, ""Ohh, a spooky dead body just jumped out!""The Bad: The Autopsy of Jane Doe while certainly atmospheric, has moments that the scenes seem deliberately obvious in how they plan on scaring you next. The story itself isn't necessarily predictable but I would have liked to see a bit more creativity when it came to how they executed the ""scare"" scenes. The focus tends to linger on areas that you know will eventually be seen again and thus comes off less a surprise when it finally happens. On the flip side, there's a very unpredictable moment as well that takes it from an already supernatural concept to being something completely unbelievable. Without spoiling it, if you're like me, you'll know when the moment happens you'll be left wondering how the **** it happened at all.The ending left something to be desired for me as well. I was looking for something definitive, although the mark of most horror films is to leave it open for the future. Unfortunately, this film leaves the door wide open so that if they wanted to expand further they can. I'll get on my soap box here and say that for once I wish a horror movie would just give a good solid finale that wraps everything up with a sense of permanence.The Judgment: All things considered, this movie didn't disappointment me. There were good solid characters and a wonderfully crafted atmosphere. It was also nice to see some mystery shrouding a horror story without giving too many cliché answers. If you're a horror nut, you'll probably be ahead of the curve and be able to guess where the story is headed and be able to predict most of the scares. If you're not, you may be surprised in the direction it takes. Overall, I think it's a film definitely worth your time and great for a stormy night inside.Check out this review and more at TheCynicist.com"
" Genuinely scary horror movie
",-0.7845,0.9259,2017-09-25 00:00:00,10,"When I picked this title and read the synopsis I thought it was a detective movie. It's also backed up by the beginning of the movie with the autopsy. Little did I know, the movie suddenly became a horror movie at its best and doubled the surprise for me because I thought it was another genre and it was that good. Definitely a must watch !Olwen Catherine Kelly as Jane Doe did an awesome job as a corpse and I read that yoga helps her role to minimize breathing.I hope there will be a sequel in the future."
" the autopsy of jane doe

" Not great, not bad.
",-0.6871,0.8292,2017-09-21 00:00:00,6,"The film has a good build up of tension that doesn't really pan out. The ending felt like the director ran out of time and couldn't come up with the ending he needed another half-hour for. Too many loose ends and the suddenness of the finish left me annoyed more than anything else. Other than that, Brian Cox is excellent in everything he does. The rest of the cast doesn't matter, although Emile Hirsch does a fair job of keeping up with him. At least until they get into the left- off bits of story in the last third of the movie. Then he sort of drifts off into facial drama that doesn't quite work. Staring off into space dramatically isn't enough to make a character, in my opinion.Considering the lack of explanation for what actually happens, I can't really rate the actual scares. For all we know, the entire movie was a hallucination due to fumes from the body. That's a more clear explanation than what's offered. The too vague Salem possible plot point wasn't even correctly referenced, as the actual events had young girls accusing older women, not the young girls themselves being accused. As that is too easy a matter to have corrected, I find myself believing the director left it in that way simply to confuse the viewer, which, again, annoys me personally. Cinematography is great, sound is great, overall mood and dialogue are both affected by Brian Cox. Any less discerning viewer would do well to spend a night on this feature."
" The bike repair shop guy episode of Diff'rent Strokes is more thrilling, tense and scary.
",-0.3581,-0.9887,2017-09-21 00:00:00,1,"Unbelievably terrible. Just awful.Really disappointing, because the actual autopsy process is true to life, thanks to Carla Valentine's help (she's an expert in the field and her stellar work here is the reason for the one star). But it's appalling. Emile Hirsch is irritating and wooden as usual, so I expected to have a relatively disappointing experience with him as lead. The corpse had more charisma and impact than him.But Brian Cox??!! His appearance here is as baffling as Idris Elba opting to star in that terrible 'Prom Night' ripoff a few years back.There are easier ways to pay the mortgage.Every tired old trope is here - radio starts acting up, lights go flickery, the phone won't work, a doomed pet as first victim, funny noises, dopey love interest, lift won't work when you need it most, door mysteriously won't open ... even spooky fog. There's even the 'funny old book/scroll/ancient text' thing. I kinda expected them to stupidly read the words aloud and something freaky to happen - but surprisingly no.The most hilarious thing is when they pour flammable liquid over the body and set it on fire in the hope they can stop the craziness. As so called 'experts', they should know that the temperature required to fully destroy a body can't be achieved by just setting it alight. It's on CSI all the time!! Plus, THE CREMATION OVEN IS RIGHT THERE!! YOU JUST DID THE CAT!!! The origin story of Jane Doe, and the reason things go freaky whenever anyone messes with her body, could have been explored a tiny bit more. That could have helped a little bit. But it's a two set affair, so there's no hope of that. Even 'Practical Magic' - that cheesy 'Sandra Bullock is a witch' film covered the witch trial related reason behind a current day witchy curse. And that film was worse than 'Speed 2'.Seriously, don't waste your precious time. If you're after a 'morgues are spooky' film, try 'After Life' with Liam Neeson and Christina Ricci - at least that actually had a bit of tension and drama. And read Carla Valentine's book - it has far better morgue related stories. Interestingly, she covers working on this film and that Emile Hirsch was a diva bitch on set....interestingly."
" Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying
",0.0,0.8243,2017-09-09 00:00:00,4,"'The Autopsy of Jane Doe' is an unusual film that takes a very different approach to the conventional horror/thriller. Almost the entire film is set in one location - a morgue, and there are only a handful of characters. In terms of building tension and suspense, the film is good. It's effectively creepy and disturbing, though I didn't appreciate the overuse of jump scares and horror stereotypes such as flashing lights.But my main issue with this film is the ending, which didn't at all live up to my expectations. The explanation for everything that happened in the film felt completely unsatisfying and a cheap way out. I like the idea behind this film and it held my attention throughout, but the film really needed a strong ending with an explanation that did the mystery justice. The whole supernatural thing didn't do much for me at all."

" Unexpected beauty
",0.5859,0.8475,2017-08-29 00:00:00,7,"I thought this was pretty good. Eerie, creepy, suspenseful. I watched this with my GF and found myself more creeped out than she was. The setting was perfect, (late at night, morgue, dead people in drawers)! I like the way it progressed with the autopsy findings along the way. It could have been improved with a little more explanation about how she came to be where they found her. Watch this with the lights off and maybe a candle burning!"
" Boring and lacking suspense and scares.
",-0.5719,-0.9744,2017-08-29 00:00:00,4,"Nothing more scarier than being stuck in a morgue with lights flickering, silent noises until you hear a bell ringing with a mysterious figure walking down the hallway. The Autopsy of Jane Die has so much potential in being a scary supernatural horror movie but it misses out in every chance it gets with the thrills. Only saving grace with the movie is its short run time so you do not have to worry about dozing off anymore. I found the film to be very boring, uninteresting plot, and the direction lacked scares and suspense. The plot is dull. An unidentified corpse goes to a morgue led by Brian Cox's character and his son Emile Hirsch. They both perform a three-phase autopsy to figure out what is the cause of death since there were no signs of physical trauma. As they learn more, they discover a written symbol inside her, which soon causes a lot of supernatural sightings in the morgue. As they both get stuck in there, when they see one of their corpses with a bell on its foot walking around. The plot does give some brief backstory to who this Jane Doe is. Without giving away details of the plot, but it does put the concept into a witchcraft idea. But the film never triggers for any suspense with the direction. You spend the whole movie watching two characters, slowly moving from one room to another. Hoping there is nothing on the other room. And the film has no suspense or thrills. Emile Hirsch is a great actor and same with Brian Cox. But there characters were decent to see. We learn about Hirsch's character that he loves his father and wants to help him out with the morgue. But at same time, he is growing up and wants to leave home for new opportunities but has trouble trying to break the news to his father. Overall, The Autopsy of Jane Doe was not as good. It lacked scares and was boring throughout. The plot was dull, taking its entire place in a morgue with tedious characters. Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox did what they could with their performances but could not save the movie. I rate the film 2 out of 5 stars."
" Great Setup for a TV series
",0.6249,-0.8983,2017-08-25 00:00:00,5,"I can't give this a very high rating, but there are admirable efforts being put forth here. The setting is very small, with most of the movie taking place in just one room, and the cast is likewise tiny. Neither of those are bad at all, but the focus of the movie still somehow seems distracted despite the lack of distractions. For example, the beginning of the film starts with what appears to be a straightforward police procedural, then diverts strongly into the young-love tangent between the son and his girlfriend which had no appreciable effect on the story at all except to break-up the tone being set and add a few minutes to the run-time.Much later on, near the end of the film, the old man promises to help Jane Doe, but immediately goes back on his word because he can't handle the suffering of taking on her wounds, which is healing her. He tries to kill himself but only succeeds in intimating to his son that he should kill him. This gets his son killed because the dad's bargain with the witch was to leave his son alone and take him only, but what was the point in it at all? He didn't seem like the type to be wishywashy or panic under stress, his character had been established as being quite stoic and having deep personal sense of integrity regarding his work and family. Bizarre. What this movie does do right though, is establish a profound interest in the silent character of Jane Doe. The ending is very open, and with a little more care put into the exposition and plot direction, I could see how this could easily have spun-off into a mini/full serial on TV/streaming-service. I personally want to see what happened before, all the way back to her origin story especially, and what happens next, such as whether the van even gets to where it was going or what.My initial impression was to rate it 7 stars but after a few hours thinking back on it kind of soured my opinion of it."

I will take a risk and say this will be in my top 3 movies of the year, and probably top 15 of all time. It's very hard to do it justice without giving away any spoilers. It is a slow boiler which builds to a satisfying climax. I have watched so many crappy movies, and this one went above and beyond its promise.If you are a lover of supernatural, creepy horror, then you need to give this one a chance."

However I was very disappointed at how it was all wrapped up, it's kind of lazy to wrap it up with witchcraft and call it a day. They had an original concept in my eyes, wouldn't be hard to make a crime scene reconstitution or something of the sort to make it more interesting. Also, the whole family story and cat thing seem very random and unnecessary to me, if it was to explain the fact that he volunteered to suffer for his son, well, the fact he is his son pretty much explains it, so the time spend trying to give the characters some dept wasn't used wisely."

" A brilliant premise tackled by the visionary director of Trollhunter
",0.802,0.9081,2017-08-04 00:00:00,7,"The title and poster of the movie give a creepy and uneasy feeling to the prospective watcher, and the same creepy atmosphere is wonderfully evident from the start of this well-executed, well-acted offering from the Norwegian director who gave us the thoroughly underrated Trollhunter. This time, he opted for conventional filmmaking instead of the found-footage style he so deftly utilized in Trollhunter, giving us time to take in the brilliantly directed scenes which immediately thrusts the audience into the unsettling premise of a Jane Doe being autopsied by a father-and-son coroner duo. The dialogue between the leads in the beginning build character almost instantaneously, and they feel real from the get-go. Compared to the recent trend of horror movies eschewing character development for cardboard cutout jump-scare fuel, this movie comes as a nice and refreshing, almost surprising, change of pace. The father and the son have contrasting personalities regarding their approach to autopsies. I expected this brilliancy in dialogue and character development to carry the whole movie - and it immediately increased my expectations of the movie; I fully expected this to be an underrated horror gem of 2016.Alas, however, half-way through the movie the director's Conjuring-esque influences seemed to show through the cracks. Though not devolving straight into jump-scare territory, the movie dips its feet into schlock scares now and then, which has a very infuriating effect on the viewer who, until now, has been amazed by the movie's restraint. The character development also suffers, with some actions by the leads contradicting their motivations.However, the concept and execution need to be commended. The actors Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch do well to sell the dread and claustrophobia experienced by the characters. Special mention to Olwen Kelly, who gives possibly the best performance of the movie, despite having no lines, no action (she plays the corpse). Definitely one of the highlights of the movie was the synergy between the camera-work and the actress's facial expressions which do more to put the viewer at unease than minute-long scenes of staring into the darkness, fully knowing the movie is going to go for that cheap jump-scare. That being said, I would say the script was the weakest aspect of the movie, the ending just leaves you wanting a little bit more, and slightly disappointed. Nevertheless, the movie does its job of selling you the premise and executing it well enough to leave you unsettled for a few days.All in all, I would call this movie as a mixed bag, though I would give it a glowing recommendation as it is head and shoulders above the spate of incomprehensible scare-fests being offered by Hollywood these days. Great work, André Øvredal.Be sure to check out Trollhunter by the same director. Although not a horror film, it merges the found-footage genre with goofy mythical creatures to amazingly hilarious yet epic results."

",0.3182,0.3322,2017-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Making a genuinely creepy flick about the supernatural is probably the most difficult achievement in life. I can only think of a few that succeeded: the Ring (1, not 2), the Shining, may be the Blair Witch Project (then). Creating a satisfactory ending is even more problematic: 'show it and ruin it'.The Autopsy of Jane Doe deserves my admiration. The first half is indeed genuinely creepy, atmospherically comparable to the scariest video game ever: Silent Hill 2. It really gets under your skin. No matter that the second half loses the real horror; there it turns into a good movie, with great actors, and a nice plot, but predictable. Just remember the scare when one of the fridges in the section room opens by itself; that's just because the tension has been gradually built up and your nerves are tight, very tight. Brilliant stuff.So, i give it a 10 for the first half, and a 7 for the second.I'm really curious what this director can do in the future."
" Great chills and foreboding
",0.6249,0.9708,2017-07-24 00:00:00,9,"How this great little horror flick is rating only in the sixes is beyond me! This is the most eerie, creepy chiller I have seen in a long while, and if you're a fan of gore, plenty of that too. The plot is original, kudos to the writer. There is some depth to the characters, and I really liked the relationship depicted between the father and son as played by Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch and I cared for them. I thought the acting by all parties was good including by those with relatively brief scenes. The morgue within which the story takes place and the corpse about which it takes place, though both technically lifeless, are each given great sinister presence by clever lighting and camera work.As someone else said earlier, this is a good scary, claustrophobic horror movie which in my opinion excels in building dread and that is where its greatest strength lays."
" A Disruptive Serendipity In The Horror Genre
",-0.7184,-0.9566,2017-07-22 00:00:00,8,"Is there anything better than a feature film of your predilection to catch you unprepared? Personally, I don't think so. Such awe has been experienced by a considerable portion of fussy cinephiles who attended the screening of a contemporary gem that came out of the Sitges Film Festival, from where the only offers worthy of consideration flow out in the genre. Winner of the Special Jury Award at the last edition of the festival, ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" is the brand-new ambrosia of the filmmaker who gained universal distinction seven years ago with an improvement of the currently infected mockumentary (aka ""Trolljegeren"").The story takes us to the basement-morgue of the Tilden family: an old man and his son, two coroners who spend days inquiring into the justification of the death of thousands and thousands of lackadaisical and whitish organisms. While Tommy is looking for the right way to inform his father about his desires, the sheriff unexpectedly bursts into with an unscathed female corpse found at the scene of a crime in Virginia. Father and son initiate a detective journey to know the cause of her death, stumbling upon endless unnatural inconsistencies that trigger in a manic game of cat and mouse, only here cat is dead (literally).I miss the time when an interesting story, an exceptionally gifted and a perceptive director was enough to make a horror film with possibilities of becoming a classic. And that's how many of the film summits are forged, movies whose exclusive pretense is to portray the malignancy while simultaneously elevating with formidable simplicity our cortisol levels, in other slang, spend a creepy pleasant time. Now, that vintage horror hasn't disappeared today, at least in form, since there are millions of remakes and reboots. However, in treatment and essence, only an indie directors clan and a negligible number of commercial filmmakers manage to retake these old-time techniques and paces by giving them a luxuriant, intelligent and equally terrifying stamp. So André Øvredal joins this restricted list with a necropsy to evil.The film handles a progression of radically impracticable features in the field at present. It's a formidable elaborated horror experiment that benefits from Brian Cox's and Emile Hirsch's compatible performances as Sherlock and his fellow, a relationship with fascinating affability the thread narrative, promoting that the characters get along with audiences in the almost excellent first half of the story.This is a sample that a solid tale, narrated in a successful way, doesn't presuppose pompous visual effects or crazy twists. It's a new trend provided by the overwhelming indie movies. Classified as ""art cinema"", Øvredal's work was truly electrifying to me, not as indie one, it had the facade of a work at the hands of a low-budget film studio, with properly American twists and conclusions but with developments, strangeness and stimulating resolutions capable of generating stupor.It's a first rate mise-en-scène, a master class, benefiting from the oppressive dismal sets, plus incidental musicality, atmospheric shots of the lacquered wooden corridors, the metallic edges of the morgue or the outdated and gloomy elevator. Gradual info revelation and unconscious ignorance by the audience conjure a work starting with diplomacy and finishing consistently. Space manipulation deserves its own section, without doubt, one of the best achieved aspects of the whole film, using mirrors, shines, chiaroscuros, visual distortions, blind spots and above all opacity in order to make assistant's hair stand on end, unprepared people with the conception that they would witness pig's breakfast. What a surprise!Unfortunately, it's not entirely perfect and in the ending, we feel a certain hesitation, symbolizing the confusing narrative conclusion, a double-edged sword, in addition, it doesn't detach from clichés and unjustifiable scares in the genre, however, they're bearable but frustrating. Just imagine you're embedded in the remotest darkness, but, you're not the only one in the place, you have the pleasure of having as companions to six corpses that are no longer within their corresponding cold rooms, you glimpse in the black mess that everything is upside down and in the middle of the scene lies a woman as pale as snow, unleashing unimaginable horrors, but suddenly, you spin around and a face with a mouth sewn shut catches you by surprise. Just disappointing. How you can have so much, and then nothing.""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" cleverly uses as McGuffin the lady who gives name to the film, meanwhile, Øvredal performs us a satisfactory autopsy on the most frightening fears that are on our minds as parasites, which can be synthesized with two succinct words: the unknown. We know absolutely nothing, the only thing we know for sure is that, at any moment, this pendulum of situations can break down. A story with an uncertain ending, but it executes an author film worthy of dithyramb, a work annexed to the best of the last years in terms of horror, a grand guignol proposal as electrifying as unexpected with an exciting 80's aroma that leaves no one indifferent."

OK, maybe that has been told many times before. Acting was good & believable. ""Open Up Your Heart"" was an appropriate background music effect, but the lyrics could have been explored more. On the negative side: A lot of the old, overdone & not believable horror hooks of flashing lights; closing doors; storm brewing; can't communicate for help; can't escape; followed by dumb decisions. One dumb decision (or is it non-decision?) was not putting the subduing mystically written cloth with tooth back inside to continue to do it's job - duh! Also lacking was a lot of the contextual backstory for our Jane Doe which would have been the most interesting part. On the neutral side: Last ten minutes or so were strong, but potentially could have been even more interesting."
" Getting Under Your Skin
",0.0,-0.9852,2017-07-15 00:00:00,10,"Lately, horror has become a roller coaster of either potential awesome or awful. In this case, it exceeded my caution. The trailer made it seem seriously eerie (which usually meant it would be mostly filler), but this body horror gem blew my expectations out of the water! From the moment the Jane Doe corpse is brought in to a family run morgue, things already start getting creepy. Whether threat is in front of the camera or just lingering on the peripheral edge, this film knows how to get under your skin. The acting was incredible with accurate medical and anatomical jargon (son of a CNA here with a little medical studying as well), the mystery is kept at an even pace, raising new questions every other minute and with every new piece of evidence, every medical anomaly and contradiction. The dialogue is sharp yet personal at times, giving it a very human feel, no stupid comedic relief when none is needed. By the plot twist, I found myself thinking ""Oh, now it all makes sense,"" which is something I very rarely think when watching any scary movie. Though Jane Doe's always shown graphically nude, it is never in any sexual context, but in a cold, dry medical context, which gave me relief that they wouldn't botch things up in this very scary tale. If you want something as creepy as Parasite Eve, I would recommend checking this body horror insanity out."

I enjoyed it, it does have a good sense of unease, and the setting is good and chilling and has some good scary moments. Didn't find it remotely gory as a lot of reviews have said although that's not a bad thing(seen worse on scenes of t v series "" Bones"" which my wife watches). When thinking about it after, the story has gaping holes in it , and a lot of questions are left unanswered. No problem with the ending as such, and film is overall well done. Olwen Catherine Kelly as the corpse leaves a impression like a cross between Matilda May in "" Lifeforce"" and to a lesser degree the corpse in the "" Drop Of Water"" segment of "" Black Sabbath"" (1963).Fairly gripping but flawed, probably will become something of a cult film. 8/10."

The execution of the horror elements in the film is classic while the whole story happens in a new setup which makes the film compelling to watch till the end.The creepiness is built thru multiple layers. As the story goes on and on, the more intense and more terrifying it becomes. The acting of Brian Cox is a dedication to the character. He performed the autopsy so professionally that a layman like me would think he must have done significant homework on Physiology.The ending completes the chilling story in a classic style. Although the film has no creative twist, it still allures me to watch every bit till the end."
" One of the freshest horror films in years
",-0.5719,0.5991,2017-07-06 00:00:00,7,"Stephen King did well to praise THE AUTOPSY OF JANE DOE, a low budget but effective slice of modern-day horror, because it does feel very much in the spirit of an early King effort. It features strong direction from the guy behind the exemplary TROLL HUNTER, and two decent performances from Emile Hirsch and in particular Brian Cox, excellent as an aged mortician about to perform his most bizarre autopsy yet.I do love a single location film that gets everything right and this is such a film. It's fast-paced, quirky, and inventive, and the corpse-focused mayhem that ensues is reminiscent of the highs of Asian horror such as MR. VAMPIRE or THE EYE. I steeled myself for some extreme gore but the film turns out to be not as gory or disturbing as I'd feared, but it is effectively frightening and the storyline feels fresh and original. If only they made more horror films like this these days!"

This movie is sitting on a rating of 6.8 (at the time of writing this) but the user reviews are all 7 or above and I wish I could say I felt the same way but I didn't. This movie has an interesting and original concept and it's done well for about half of the movie. Once everything gets 'scary' the movie goes downhill. There were a lot of pointless scenes that could have not been in the movie at all as they did not advance the plot in any way and, in my opinion, actually slowed the movie down. I wish i could have enjoyed this as much as everyone else but most of the problems just took me out of it. However I will say that this is better than most straight to home video films. 5/10"

Or sometimes, like this time, not only ending but whole middle part as well.I am being honest here and I have to say that I sort off liked the start. One bad thing even about start, or at least something I didn't quite like was whole density and tension at the bare start. From a good horror I expect it to give me some mild and slow intro. Here I did not felt that. It was like jumping in a cold pool without checking the water. And who likes that? I hoped for that to be the only drawback but then those rookie producing mistakes started to pile up. Bad acting, unmatching set of emotions for a certain situations, theatrically dialogues, common, horror set ups which are getting boring already... are just some of the reasons for my disappointment. And visible soul? Is this cartoon? But after all it had some genuinely scary moments that gave me ""Holy ****"" expressions, it had uncensored blood and gore and they were not shy and haven't hesitated with nudity which is honorable to mention. Still, it wasn't enough for any note higher that an average one. Because of personal disappointment I chose to go even lower that average."

Except the small parts of the opening and the ending, the rest of the story takes place in a postmortem room and its building. It is a one night story and revolves around two characters, a coroner father and his assistant son. After receiving an unidentified body to examine, the son decides to stay back with his dad by dropping out the plan to go a date with his girlfriend. As the procedure begins, the night goes on. But at the half way through, they begin to experience the strange events. And once it goes beyond their hands, they try to survive the threads that come their way which pretty much the rest of the film.A short and sweet horror. I mean no sweet, but very effective theme. There are lots of things you won't understand, even the film does not explain them for us. But if you sit back and think about them after you have watched it, you would get many perspectives, like about the corpse, and what happened at the end. I could have revealed mine in here, but it would only spoil your watch if you are yet to see it. Overall, there's nothing serious you are going to miss any details. Except one question that nobody sure about is who is/was Jane Doe, I mean her background story that linked to this film event. Only a prequel would explain that. So I hope they make one quickly. Meantime, don't miss it if you're looking for a decent horror film. Because it's much better that any recent horrors.7/10"

I love to watch horror and drama movies, mostly if there is a larger than life element, truthful aspects and imagination over and above the normal. This is one such movie, so very well played between three characters with perfect blend of intuition, coincidence and reality. The corpse with bell is in a way awesomely freakish. And afcourse since the plot surrounds around the unnamed - dead Jane doe is so very well created, thought thru and depicted. The father and the son character, the relationship and the complexity shown along with the actual horror is worth a watch.

Hard story to end though, so I can see why. A few glaring plot holes affected immersion, but they were few and temporary.Wonderfully acted by the two protagonists, they had genuine screen presence and it was easy to immerse myself into the film due to the quality performances.Cinematically beautiful, great shots, lighting and excellent sound all combining to create a wonderfully tense, suspenseful and creepy as hell atmosphere. For someone who loves suspense and a slowly growing plot in my horror movies instead of full action and gore, this one was a real find.I highly recommend it, but be warned, my wife was not able to get through the whole thing (she is a bit jumpy though)."

",0.0,-0.9943,2017-06-03 00:00:00,6,I've known about this for a while but didn't feel the need to ever watch it. A slow day came along and I decided to check it out. I love horror films and something about this did feel intriguing so at the least I'd make for an enjoyable time. The films chills come at predictable times and I'm not overly fond of the ending but I did enjoy it for the most part and the concept for the power of the dead body is intriguing.The film follows a father and son coroner who are given the body o an unidentified woman given the name Jane Doe. The case is mysterious as there seems to be no outside damage to the body but her wrists and ankles are broken and her tongue has non surgically been removed. Her eyes are cloudy which indicates someone who has been dead for a few days. Things become weirder once they cut open the body for an internal check and also discover weird and haunting incidents that start occurring around the morgue.The film stars Emile Hirsch (who isn't in a whole lot these days) and Brian Cox as his father. Olwen Kelly is Jane Doe and is predominant in the film but does not have to do anything. The film offers a decent amount of body gore as you can imagine with a film that takes place during an autopsy. The scares don't come often and are generically built. I wasn't too impressed by the ending of the film and lack of followup to the mystery of the dead body.The predicted cause of Jane Doe's death and origins are quite interesting but I wanted more elaboration to her back story. The film isn't really memorable and doesn't need to be. Its a throw away horror film that works because of the situation of taking place in a closed space and involving a haunting by what seems to be a completely dead entity. Not anything to write home about though Andre Øvredal has proved to be quite creative between this film and Trollhunter. I'd like to see what he can come up with next.6/10

" One of the year's most notable Horror experiences
",-0.6096,-0.5729,2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"A high-concept horror/thriller mixed with a hearty dose of mystery that doesn't have any right being as captivating as it is, Troll Hunter director André Øvredal delivers one of the year's very best genre pieces with his first English language feature, The Autopsy of Jane Doe.Set almost entirely within the confines of Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch's family morgue and crematorium as the father and son duo take a late night job they're going to quickly regret, as Olwen Kelly's ""Jane Doe"" is wheeled into their laboratory after mysteriously appearing at a murder scene, Øvredal's film almost instantly captivates us as Cox's Tommy and Hirsch's Austin begin to understand that something isn't quite right with this particular cadaver.To say more about Autopsy's story would be a disservice to Øvredal and screenwriters Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing's vision, as while the film loses small points towards the end for explaining a little too much of the mystery at hand, for a large portion of the films runtime you'll be sitting with white knuckles and nervous anticipation at what Øvredal will throw at us next.It would've been easy for Autopsy to fall quickly off the rails with an overuse of gore or cheap scares and while the film certainly isn't for the gore adverse (there's ample corpse exploration throughout the film) Øvredal steers mostly clear of usual genre tactics to create a genuinely unnerving experience that sinks under the skin and has a polish and professional nature that often goes wanting in other similar experiences.Also helping Autopsy's cause is fine central turns from legendary actor Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch, with Hirsch in particular delivering his best turn in many a moon. With Cox and Hirsch delivering the goods, Olwen Kelly as the Jane Doe corpse also brings her A-game as a lifeless corpse.You'd be initially crazy to think someone lying on an operational table could do such fine work but Kelly brings a menacing and foreboding presence to the whole film in a performance that marks a notable example of the power of acting, without having to do very much at all, least of all speaking.Final Say – While its synopsis may initially suggest yet another bargain bin horror/thriller, Øvredal's film is anything but. A smartly wound and tightly paced experience, The Autopsy of Jane Doe is one of the most notable genre films of recent times and a genuinely frightening feature that deserves a larger audience than it's so far been afforded.4 unfortunate house cats out of 5"
" Good But Frustrating
",-0.4404,0.2773,2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"I've found this movie to be very graphic. Personally, I'm one of those people who wanted to follow med school but decided that performing autopsies is not really something I want to do on a daily basis.Well, half of this movie is an autopsy with virtually nothing censored. You get to see everything and while I can't say if it is accurate or not, it is rather graphic. That being said, I must give it to them, it is a good horror movie. It is a smart horror movie I may add. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense and there are many, many questions unanswered (personally, I find the end totally anti-climatic) but it builds tension slowly and nicely. Yes, at the end you ask ""who was that, why, where, when, how the heck "" and you'll get no answer whatsoever. Actually, for all intents and purposes, the movie puts a lot of questions and ends with answering only one of them.So from this point of view, there is no finality, there is no sense of satisfaction. When the movie ended, I expected something else to happen, to explain, to show. There is an overall answer and theme that is explained but it ended when it got interesting. However, from a horror perspective, pacing, tension building, it works just fine. It feels like playing Silent Hill, the horror game. So it is a strange hybrid. The concept itself is relatively neat and unused. I haven't seen any movies do this and I've seen my share of horror movies. Actually, I can say that the entire exposition is fresh. Even if it is low budget, it never feels this way and apart from transitions of 30 FPS to 60 FPS (for cinematic effects), it looks really nice. The characters are believable and the story in a way actually makes sense.But the problem is that while the concept is good, while the story is good, it builds up to something and that something never happens. And that's why I can't give it more than a 7 / 10."

I like the ending and that the film makers don't have to explain everything -you figure out how the first murders happened and it's a fun/not typical ending.

His reputation only grew earlier this year when Stephen King called this a horror film that rivaled Alien. I also hear it does for mortuaries what Jaws did for oceans, but i'd say mortuaries do that on their own. Much like Alien, the movie takes place in one location where a lot of the most disturbing stuff comes from the slow movement of the camera through corridors, or from haunting silences. Ovredal couldn't do a better job in these scenes and the original idea for a horror film and slowly building mystery of the thing does the rest.Taking place at a mortuary where an unidentified woman has been brought in, the father- son team of morticians played by Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch work toward establishing cause of death but find a bunch of internal abnormalities, and that's before things really get weird.There's a lot here that fits into the horror clichés category- from the storm going on outside to the radio switching stations on it's own and the freezer and body drawers suddenly going on the fritz. There's also a cat, so you know what that means. It's a little too reliant on jump scares, but it maintains it's atmosphere well enough.The ace in the hole for this movie though is Brian Cox, who I think deserves to be mentioned in Oscar talks for this. His brings practicality, good sense, touching regret and even more miraculously, keeps letting us take this all seriously, especially during the last half hour when the script turns to contrivance and cheesy B-movie material.Then there's Emile Hirsch, a promising young actorwhen not in Speed Racer, and I do feel he's underrated a lot of the time. He doesn't get as much to do here but his character also never comes off as dumb and he too is likable and someone you want to pull for.So overall this is a really well directed movie featuring two really good performances that keep it from falling too far over. This movie also has a really promising premise, one I wish it would have done a bit more with, like maybe probe the emotional and metaphysical like it, at first, seems to want to do before just becoming another B-movie. I go 7 out of 10. If you guys liked this, be sure to check me out on Youtube for more."
" Dead but not resting...
",-0.3919,0.9783,2017-05-02 00:00:00,6,"What lured me in to watch ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"", aside from it being a horror movie, was the synopsis for the movie. This synopsis seemed like the movie could actually turn out to be quite interesting.I will be the first to admit that ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" is a rather thrilling and suspenseful movie. And it was genuinely creepy enough to actually be disturbing. Director André Øvredal was really quite good at pacing the movie and combining storytelling with atmosphere and suspense.The movie has some really good acting performances, despite it being very, very limited in numbers of actors and actresses, actually. I will take a moment to point out Brian Cox's performance in this movie, because he was really great here, and he carried the movie so nicely. It was as if the role of senior coroner Tommy was written specifically with him in mind.""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" starts out with the audience knowing very little about what is to happen, and slowly more and more odd and disturbing things happen in the cellar. However, it is the way that the audience is kept in the dark and forced to speculate and guess at what is going on that really adds flavor to the storyline. And the build up of suspense and scares is quite intense and so well-executed that it adds a very in-your-face atmosphere to the movie.The special effects in the movie were also quite good and convincing. And it is nice to see a horror movie that doesn't solely rely on its special effects in order to be effective in terms of how entertaining and scary the movie turns out to be.This is definitely one of the better horror movies that came around in 2016. If you enjoy the horror genre, then I can strongly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"", as it is quite entertaining and definitely worth the time and effort."

" Scary, gory and original!
",-0.2942,0.9934,2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Surprising how some horror movies have their ways of boosting spirits with their precision. Autopsy of Jane Doe starts off pretty effectively and promising. From the main titles, it's obvious the film is very neatly edited and puts the sound to good use. It's richly colored with smooth beautiful photography, fast-paced and subtle. You can clearly feel the passion of the crew behind it. On 33rd minute into the film, I must say I haven't been this thrilled for quite some time. Having me on the edge of the seat, it delivers more and more surprises by every minute. A non-stop suspense, very well combined with gore and scares. In addition, the film doesn't much rely on jump scares, making it even more original, but the atmosphere and the plot are pretty spooky. I'm loving it! I just wish it was a bit longer. I would love to see what happens next. Needless to say a sequel would be nice. Absolutely fabulous! See this movie!"

Goodbye logic and a salute to worn out clichés.It's really hard to rate it since it's not that bad as a horror movie but I expected much more from the great start so it's a mixed bag..."

" Presses all the right ""scare"" buttons.....
",0.0,0.8884,2017-04-25 00:00:00,9,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe presses all the right ""scare"" buttons.....This is really how good horror films should be made. This film adopts familiar horror tropes. Which is probably not that surprising given most things have been done before in one form or another. The reason it works so very well and scare's the pants off you is its careful and considered approach. This film slowly, creeps up on you, always ratcheting up the tension notch by creepy notch and as it does so it starts introducing horror elements that, subconsciously or consciously, play on the inexplicable fears most of us share as emotional, not always rational, human beings. The films cause is helped enormously too, by great casting choices and really superlative acting. Scottish actor Brian Cox shares excellent chemistry with Emile Hirsch, who plays his son and lab assistant. There's real caring of the kind you would find between father and son and its this emotional bond that makes what happens to the pair so much more terrifying and disturbing.I was really, really impressed by The Autopsy of Jane Doe and I suspect, in my humble opinion, if you are a horror fan, you may well be too. Nine out of ten from me."
" A Well Done Horror Movie That Weakens As It Progresses
",-0.5994,-0.9604,2017-04-25 00:00:00,6,"While I praise The Autopsy of Jane Dou for being a pretty original idea in a time when horror movies are at a low point and having amazing characters and setting, the ridiculous ending that provides no closer ends up ruining the film. Lets begin by addressing the strongest aspect of The Autopsy of Jane Dou. 1. Setting & Characters: Perhaps the greatest thing about The Autopsy of Jane Dou is the setting. The idea of having the setting take place in a morgue located in the basement just screams horror and immediately sets a haunting mood. While not as strong as the setting, the characters are somewhat relatable. I really liked how they were people who tried to come up with a reasonable explanation for things instead of just assuming its a ghost/witch. 2. Scares: Perhaps the most important part of a horror movie is the horror. Sadly, the scares presented in The Autopsy of Jane Dou aren't the best and just resolve around there being gore (which I liked, but more on that later). Unlike another horror movie, It Follows, the ghost/witch doesn't feel like a very dangerous creature due to it not doing much until the last 40 minutes of the movie. While it is okay to slowly build up the monster as the movie progresses, the ghost/witch in Jane Dou makes itself seem like a strong entity with no buildup. Also, having the ghost/witch have it's own theme song doesn't fit with the entity itself unlike the creature in Jeepers Creepers. 3. Ending: While it is common to see happy endings at the end of horror movies, it is a relief to see a horror movie that chooses to have a very depressing ending. However, I feel that the ending could have been much better. For example, instead of everyone dying in the end, it would have been interesting to see the son get framed for murdering everyone due to having his girlfriend's blood on his shirt and being the last one alive. In the end, The Autopsy of Jane Dou is a very original horror movie that contains a really good half, but fails to create a ending that fits. Also, for being low budget, the movie contains some amazing shots and everyone plays their character really well. Final Verdict:6/10"
" Possible future classic
",0.0,-0.2706,2017-04-23 00:00:00,7,"I honestly don't know where the bad reviews are coming from. Haters gonna hate I suppose but this movie deserve praise. Perhaps slightly overrated but without doubt a good watch.This is not supposed to be one of those movies that are meant to send you screaming while watching it, so don't expect it.There are a few predictable moments but the plot was not predictable, at least I did not find it that way. I watch an insane amount of horror and this was one of those that actually gave me goose bumps. This is a movie that stays with you and makes you paranoid, not only for the claustrophobic moments but it makes you wonder if life and death is as easy as we make it out to be.A friend of mine recommended me to see this and even after her praise along with the reviews I read prior to watching, I was not disappointed. What drags down my rating is I would like to see more! I want a sequel or a prequel to dig deeper into this story and expand it.I think this has the potential to become a classic in the horror genre, a breath of fresh air after all the found footage horror lately."
" Refreshing change
",0.0,0.3047,2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Loved this movie, reminds of the old horror movies that don't rely purely on special effects.Starts of as a standard story, but slowly the creep factor rises, little things here and there.Things that could be accidents like blood red pool of liquid seeping out of the refrigerator, banging noses that turn out to be a cat or other animal stuck in the vents.But then more unexplainable things happen, the cremation Furness turning on by itself, removed organs rapidly decaying.Well worth a watch."
" Not sure what the fuss is about
",-0.2411,0.7889,2017-04-19 00:00:00,5,"I'm trying to figure out why this film could win any awards, why it was able to get accolades from rather well know authors and why people considered this film interesting. Not sure if I could avoid spoilers while reflecting on this film and what people could have possibly seen to raise it above average. Granted, I'm not fond of limited characters and the interaction of mainly two characters. The dynamics become too predictable, no matter any substantial revelations between them. It just did not tie things between what had just occurred and what was happening. Did the previous family desecrate the body and unleash some form of vengeance upon them? Since this is what appears to happen due to the autopsy. I suppose it left too much to one's imagination to attempt to rationalize the going's on of the story. Though, it may just be a matter of taste and It's a good thing that we all don't like the same things. So, that just may have biased me from enjoying the film. With that said, no, I would not recommend anyone to see it, unless you just had nothing better to watch."
" Very good horror film
",-0.1987,0.9713,2017-04-16 00:00:00,9,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" (2016) is a highly involving, scary, creepy and chilling horror / mystery movie. Basically there were only three actors during the most of the movie, but performances were uniformly good, even by Olwen Catherine Kelly ... i won't spoil it. Setting as well as plot were pretty unique for a horror movie. Directing and script were very solid - at running time 1 20 min ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" never dragged and was perfectly paced.Overall, this is a very good and effective horror movie with some mystery. I loved the ""horror"" side of this film as much as mystery surrounding it. Its one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while."

Not knowing what to expect, I am a huge horror fan from old school Nightmare on elm street to blood and gore films like Dead Alive including a few foreign films like I saw the Devil. But in no way was I prepared for this. After 20 minutes or so I was in heart pumping suspense. I felt like a little kid watching his first scary movie. There were a few good scares but what did it was the acting, the atmosphere and that creepy face that looked so alive and not once did it blink or move. I couldn't sleep well that night and a movie has not done that to me since I was 12 years old and I am 34 years old now. Just Wow... Watch with caution."
" Superior Scary Supernatural Horror
",-0.5267,0.6227,2017-04-13 00:00:00,10,"The two male leads have great on screen chemistry and the premise gradually reveals itself with supernatural dread. The film earns it's title by actually showing you the entire autopsy from start to finish, of Jane Doe. I like it when things are that perversely literal.Some people have called this film Lovecraftian but it is not, it is something much more traditional. If you want Lovecraftian try The Void, just a little bit better in my humble opinion."
" I will be damned
",-0.3818,-0.3041,2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"This is how horror films should be. Getting what you expect, and more. Horror films are a perfect example for a kind of art that works based on tricks, based on a formula. You can't diverge from the formula too much, you have to be true to it to make it work. You don't want to alienate the audience. But at the same time it's also important to introduce new elements, to play with the stereotypes and the genre. Horror films are very tricky in that way. And ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" is a perfect example of how to do it right. No, I won't tell you how they did it. Watch it yourself."
" Mostly terrific horror flick
",-0.1531,-0.9728,2017-04-08 00:00:00,7,"The Autopsy Of Jane Doe almost gets the formula right, which is good enough in an industry just packed with lacklustre horror, but it still doesn't have the juice to be considered a classic. Near the end it kind of derails a bit and throws some cheap scares and a touch of illogical plotting our way, but the effort put in is better than that as a whole, so it wast tough to forgive. One thing it nails is an atmosphere of dread. Picture this: two coroners, a father (Brian Cox) and son (Emile Hirsch, who's been MIA for awhile) are working late, in the calm before a very large storm set to batter their town. The local sheriff (Roose Bolton from Game Of Thrones, who's real name escapes me), has brought in a stiff, an unidentifiable dead girl who perished under, shall we say, odd conditions. As the pair of them work into the night, strange things begin to happen, and a sense of unease, directly related to the corpse, begins to grow. It's apparent that the body has some freaky secrets which are now wreaking havoc all over the morgue, causing quite the hellish night for Cox and Hirsch. What a scenario, eh? They milk it for all it's worth, and come up with something pretty effective. Cox can pretty much play anything perfectly, and his slide from stalwart mortuary expert to frenzied self preservation mode is quite impressive. There's some genuinely blood freezing moments of terror as well, the isolation, creepy morgue drawers, bumps in the night and overall malevolence hanging in the air to provide that wicked atmosphere. It's just when things get a bit hectic near the end it loses some of the magic, feeling like something a little cheaper and run of the mill. For the most part though, this one is a prime spine tingler and one of the best horror efforts so far this year."

The movie is SO predictable that I could say for sure what was going to happen in the end. Unnecessary jump scares and extremely long pauses.

In this movie you basically only have two major actors and the other dozen are just extras that you won't see much. Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch did a perfect job playing father and son, the ones conducting the autopsy of a mysterious women. While doing the autopsy step by step they explain what could have happened and are soon to find out there are strange forces involved in the whole case of Jane Doe. It's a bit graphic but not really gore. It's basically you watching an autopsy, so if you have problems with internal organs and so you will turn your head away quite a few times. The story itself is entertaining to watch. The tension builds up towards the end. Good little horror movie for the amateurs of this genre."
" Stiffly Scary
",-0.4939,-0.998,2017-03-31 00:00:00,8,"This review of The Autopsy of Jane Doe is spoiler free**** (4/5)NEVER HAS THERE been a horror more brazen and more deadly original than The Autopsy of Jane Doe, after spending years on the Hollywood blacklist it finally came to the hands of Norwegian director André Øvredal, who after his 2010 found-footage troll expose in Trollhunter has become quite the cinematic thespian. Granted he's no Stephen King, David Cronenburg or indeed, George A. Romero but here, he has studied the horror rule book very closely, pulling off jump scares from the simplest things and it's brilliant. After last year's Lights Out, Don't Breathe and The Conjuring 2, there was a reason why 2016 was called one of the best years for horror, and Øvredal's exceptional English-language debut couldn't have come timelier.Set over one night in a Virginia Mortuary, father-and-son coroners Tommy and Austin Tilden (Cox and Hirsch) get the body of a mysterious dead woman, Jane Doe (Kelly), cause of death; unknown, age between mid to late twenties. Starting out as a whodunit mystery, thinking it's going to be an ordinary autopsy what they discover is something out of the ordinary. Seemingly impossible for a corpse. On the outside she appears to be just a corpse, but they find cloudy grey eyes, hips under proportion, shattered bones and trauma. When they cut up the body the film then shifts tone to a what the hell? Mystery they find a lot of things suggesting that her cause of death could've been caused from burning, torture or perhaps something weirder, it's here when the film takes a drastic turn. But why this woman? The mysteries stack up. As they cut up this unknown woman, finding things out of the ordinary while reciting lines from the morgue's library to find out what really happened, but then things take a turn for the worse, the tension rises. They need to escape with their lives, but it turns out that the dead are after them, sound familiar? Well, here during their attempts to escape many things other things hit their path they think that she is awake and she wants to kill them. Tommy, though being a traditionalist by putting bells around the ankles of the corpses, he would hear if they come back to life. Typically, there is one of those moments here too. Yet, in many of its routes Jane Doe, is a sombre story as Øvredal adds emotional heft to his characters too, deftly handling them with a story of family, giving them a moment to share emotion by talking to each other while on the run. There are many original features here some that we have never seen before, sure in some aspects it takes a page from Alien, The Shining, Seven or perhaps even Night of the Living Dead, if they were directed by Cronenburg but there is not a single moment that's rehashed, or indeed out of place. It's also a little confusing, if you're not following correctly you will lose count of how many mysteries there really are here, in addition you may even lose sight of how many genres this film stacks up as it goes from horror, mystery, escape thriller and a revenge story. It's progressively creepy and boldly told, however, the film isn't perfect as there is a moment when the two are studying causes that outstays its welcome. But it's brilliant; it's gruesome without the gore, tense without being over the top. There's an endless list as to what film Jane Doe is. Perhaps unnerving to some and weird to others no matter what you feel this B-movie is boldly told and deadly original gold. Prepare to be scared stiff (get it?).VERDICT: Progressively creepy, boldly told, and exceptionally scary, The Autopsy of Jane Doe delivers on almost every aspect."

But then it pops up a few that make it worth the time to watch such films, and this film is an example of it. What I really like about the film is first and foremost that it is true to the horror genre, but at the same time is innovative and has many surprising moments. But it is first and foremost very scary. All of the action takes place mostly in a room, and one could assume that it would be boring. But no. The action and excitement builds up slowly. The film gets more and more exciting, not to mention scary. I think the two who play the lead roles are very good, they manage to produce an autopsy in a credible manner. The film is also about the relationship between father and son, and is sympathetic and good. If it's a really good horror you're after, look no further. But you should bear to see both blood and quite grotesque scenes too. This film is not for those with weak nerves...."

" Utterley amazing... for the first 2/3.
",0.0,-0.6115,2017-03-13 00:00:00,7,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe started SO freaking well. I was enthralled right from the opening scene, which first few seconds played with perspective and focus. We are carried from a peaceful environment to a grotesque scene where I jumped a little from my seat just by the exacerbated sound of a camera flash. The photography was stellar. The detail, the angle, the light, everything was superb and simply chilling. There's a lot of play with perspective and the close-ups of simple objects contribute to the eerie atmosphere. For me, it was easily worth 5 stars till then point.When we meet our two protagonists, father and son who will perform the autopsy on Jane Doe, I was still excited and in awe. The interaction between characters was believable and I enjoyed seeing how those two handled the work and each other, Austin his father's pupil, trying to learn his father's business as best as he could. The photography was still amazing and I was immediately hooked by how familiar the creepy workplace worked. These guys could not be more normal and this was their home. Sure, it had the potential to be creepy, but it felt safe and normal, if that makes any sense.Throughout these scenes there were several suspenseful moments where the director had me slowly nudging towards the edge of my seat. I never knew if something really bad was going to happen. And the fact is, it usually did not, not in the way I am used to. There were no easy scares up to this point. There were several freaky elements that contributed to a creepy atmosphere but all in all it was a serious approach to the reality of two coroners. The gross stuff came so naturally I didn't ever see it coming until it was in my face. The sounds were so graphic that I actually gagged on more than one occasion.I really enjoyed the movie till about two thirds or so. Then it all started going downhill for me. The father's theory about what was happening seemed far-fetched, Austin annoyed the heck out of me cause he kept putting his face in harm's way and the acting or script was just bad, I still can't figure out which. I mean, who (spoiler ahead) peeks through a hole, suddenly sees a corpse looking back at him, just nonchalantly begins to figure out the next step?(/spoiler) I am ashamed to admit I shrieked in that scene because I was firmly convinced nothing would happen, considering the previous setup, and that guy does even twitch. Eurgh.Towards the end I felt like such a great work of art was being mistreated for no good reason. The film just became a mockery of what it had been until then - even though the scariest scene of the movie, for me, came then. And when I thought I could not be more annoyed, the last second of the movie proved me otherwise.I don't get it. I swear I don't get how anyone could butcher such an awesome movie, a gem amongst all other horror stuff out there. So yeah, I am still a bit upset."
" The central female character looks like Emily Blunt
",0.3612,0.575,2017-03-10 00:00:00,6,"This is a movie full of anatomical cuts, and explanations good enough to relegate to a lower division any of the PD series on TV for the last 10 years. No gore is spared. Of necessity, the screenplay is imaginative within a highly claustrophobic atmosphere, thereby giving some substance a potentially flimsy story. Positive aspects: Great Brian Cox performance; the son's girlfriend probably provides the most unexpected turn in the movie; Jane Doe is a beauty who resembles Emily Blunt and is literally to die for; some great horror touches along the way. Direction, photography and special effects quite sound. Negative aspects: Why bother? The movie is worth watching only if you like horror."

All this done in a minimalist setting which I have noticed England, Ireland, Scotland, and Australia do with such talent. They take limited locations, sometimes just one for an entire movie, and build up the suspense and tension. They don't need all the grandiose locations and special effects like Hollywood does and often fails, and they succeed.

Well, good if you don't like to be scared that much, as the movie is full of long monologues and reimbursements of the story almost like in Scooby Doo!! Acting, for this class of actors, was was really really poor and sometimes so bad that made me laugh... The idea for the movie is good but the direction of the movie really SUCKS! Thus the whole twist suffers from silliness and bad acting.If you like good horror movies I really discourage you from watching it. Unless you like to wast your time, or are one of those people that ""want to watch a horror movie with their girlfriend but are too scared to do it""... pity"
" Dull and Predictable. I needed my brain autopsied after this!
",-0.4574,-0.9835,2017-02-28 00:00:00,1,"As I read the other reviews (after I wasted 90 minutes of my life), I was amazed. It was as if no one watched the boring, waste of Brian Cox talents movie that I did. Stephen King compared this piece of crap to Alien? He must be drinking and drugging again, or got paid to say this. Basically an underdeveloped story that goes nowhere slowly. I won't 'spoil' it for anyone, but I yawned and looked at my watch way too often during this lame attempt at horror. Basically an autopsy film with barely explained 'supernatural' overtones, it's not only BORING and SLOW, it's PREDICTABLE. There isn't an original thought in this. The only positive it had is that it wasn't one of those stupid, overrated 'found footage' movies. What it was was terrible. For a 90 minute movie it felt like it was four hours long. This is always a bad sign. When I read about how frightening this was and how horrifying, I have to wonder if my fellow reviewers are frightened by, oh, Sesame Street? Because there wasn't a genuine scare in this entire movie."
" where are the friends?
",0.4767,0.6933,2017-02-22 00:00:00,8,"FINALLY a horror movie that does not include friends going to the middle of nowhere / cabin/ woods and get killed. honestly I was hesitant to watch the movie with 6+ rating on IMDb and I guess everyone knows it is really hard to find a good horror movie these days, but I am glad I watched this ... kept me on my toes 80% of the movie although I wish if the resolution was a bit different than witches and zombie thing. Cox did a fantastic acting as the dad, however, the son was meh just OK. All in all this is a must-watch if you are into horror movies and I think it deserves higher rating ..somewhere between 7.5 to 8."
" More than I expected
",0.0,0.8701,2017-02-20 00:00:00,9,When I first saw the title and the IMDb rating...I was wary of this movie. Once again - the reviews and ratings are the opposite of what I saw. I was extremely entertained by the story from the beginning to the end! The ending was NOT what I expected and I was pleasantly surprised. I may be the minority - but I am happy that I am not a sheep.
" Run of the mill? yes and no.....
",0.4019,-0.958,2017-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Is it just another run of the mill horror movie? well that depends on how u see it...its the first time u will watch a movie where a horror story is centered entirely around a corpse as the main antagonist driving the show . Usually its spirits or some legend , haunted house etc. While it isn't ground breaking as The Ring, Blaire with project etc, it does bring something new to the table. Introduce a body which is strange it turns the the whole premise into an haunted mansion with some inspiration of Silent Hill. i will say its an effective blend of gore + horror but gore not in the same fashion as those typical gore movies like the wrong turn or some psychopath mutant taking off human one by one . the gore here is centered around the autopsy of a body and how the autopsy is conducted. combined with the horror element and creepy atmosphere it gives us a new blend . The sound in this movie is exceptionally well done.The story is about 2 pathologists whose jobs is conducting autopsy on the deceased. It is routine until they get an unusual body of a young woman which seems out of the ordinary.They will then trace the background of the woman and discover something sinister.Although the premise works well, it does employ the typical run of the mill scare tricks with the Silent hill like fog atmosphere at times which can be putting to some especially when the premise itself is centered around psychological horror .Wont give spoilers but its something we already know about in medieval times but u wont see it coming until it is revealed.Once can either love this film or hate it ."
" Intense Stuff
",0.0772,0.8845,2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Watched this movie per chance and I did not regret it. However, I believe a big opportunity has been wasted here. The first half is honestly perfect; the setting is suggestive, the characters are both interesting and disquieting, the rhythm of the events is slow but regular. A positive climax. Then something huge happens (the viewers will know what I am referring to) and, instead of proceeding with the same discretely thrilling vibe, the subject changes abruptly, along with the overall atmosphere and the nature of the movie itself. My accuse is precisely directed towards a certain episode involving Austin's girlfriend : why insert it in a coherent plot? It appears completely unrelated and has no relevant consequences after its occurrence. A second attack goes against the meaning of the ending sequence : the so called ""open final"" is a frequent expedient in the genre, but usually requires a solid base to begin with. With ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" we see a very promising beginning followed by a sudden interruption : we see the lightning but can't hear the thunder. The feeling I draw from all this is an unpleasant mixture of dissatisfaction and incompleteness : I cannot say I haven't been fully entertained by this product, but I can certainly state that the movie could have been written better."
" Tense, but can't escape the pitfalls of its genre
",-0.3563,-0.5654,2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"I'm not very knowledgeable about horror, and I can count on one hand how many modern horror films I've seen in cinemas. Perhaps it was because of this heightened immersion cinema gives, but I did feel that this movie made me way more tense than other horror movies from the past years, like ""It follows"". I enjoyed exploring the feeling of being emotionally manipulated, longing for the next release of tension. To me, this movie did this part of the job quite well.The premise of the movie works (partly) quite well, and the movie is at its best when the actual autopsy is going on. An early part of the autopsy is checking her eyes, and after that they leave them open. The open (lfelike) eyes and the knowledge that it is a horror film, made the following sequences the highlight of the film.The last chapters is where the movie falls apart and becomes mostly uninteresting. Perhaps because it becomes so similar to what we have seen many times before?"
" Dead people have their secrets
",-0.6486,0.9625,2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. It wasn't anything groundbreaking or particularly remarkable, but it was a good watch, and a nice change of pace from the common horror crap that rushes to jump right in with the scares and forgets to tell a story and focus in the atmosphere in between, this film was different it had a mixture of science with the supernatural done well I found it so intriguing. There was such a macabre & poignantly intense atmosphere with some great actors.Based on the name I expected something different, kinda disappointed like on of those cheap productions and yes I did have good jump scares but I definitely had good plot twist it was better them most. I did not consider this movie gore at all. Human anatomy is only considered ""gore"" in horror if it is gratuitous or has an unrealistic focus (i.e. someone gets cut and the movie focus on BLOOD EVERYWHERE). I thought the relationship between the father and son was fleshed out perfectly, from the start - it was very obvious that there was a lot of love and respect between them in spite of struggles and shortcomings and those were touched on but never wallowed.Why is this not called, ""A Brian Cox movie,"" ?, far superior actor, no real offense to Emile Hirsch, he just hasn't gotten there yet.﻿not trying to put Hirsch down, but a comparison of his body of work and accolades against Brian Cox's does show that the older performer damn well earned his place as a great actor, even over Hirsch. Doesn't mean the younger actor won't catch up on Cox or even surpass him, but right now he's the Deniro to Hirsch's Norton (using 'The Score' as a less than perfect comparison). I have to give huge props to the actress playing Jane Doe, Olwen Catherine Kelly. For someone playing a corpse, there was so much menace, so much tension, so much dare I say, smugness, shown in her face, she helped keep the tension level at 10.﻿Definitely horror done right it's worth a watch."
" Good stuff, but fails to scare
",-0.7935,0.9437,2017-02-08 00:00:00,6,"I have watched a lot of horror movies in my time. To say I'm desensitised to them would be an understatement. Very few of them are capable of scaring or effecting me in a single scene, let alone for an entire 90 minutes. Sadly, 'The Autopsy of Jane Doe' was another film that fell into that category. I could easily tell that it was of a higher quality than 95% of modern horror films, but it still didn't unnerve me for a single moment.It's rare to see acting of this high quality in a horror film. Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox in the lead roles are very impressive. They are both accomplished actors in their own right, so to get them signed onto a horror film they must have been shown a very impressive script. The only problem having such well known faces in a horror film can be that it adds a level of security for the audience. They are familiar with these actors and so feel a subconscious level of security. It's an unfortunate downside to a couple of excellent performances.There's a lot of good stuff in 'The Autopsy of Jane Doe'. For me the best part was probably the slow reveal of the story. Things never feel dragged out, yet it is a slightly slow paced film for the first half. The audience is always fascinated as to what is going to happen next. There's a lot of great film making here, but sadly it failed in the most important aspect of them all - I was never scared."
" Well Made and a Fun Premise, but Lacking...
",0.4019,-0.8407,2017-02-07 00:00:00,7,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe caught my attention from the trailer because it looked like it would be a fun, creepy premise, which it is. The filmmaking is clever and well imagined. Great prosthetic makeup effects and performances.The premise is simple. A father and his son are doing autopsies and the latest body to come down needing a cause of death (COD) hides more questions than answers.I enjoyed watching this film, but I thought the premise could have been explored a little more. The characters should have discovered a little more revealing the history of this witch and events could have reflected what was happening in the present. Instead it's just left to some supernatural force that is never really explained and horror and tension ensue. Sadly this is the trend with many generic horror movies from the past few years. To be a true classic the film should have dug a little deeper.But that being said of what could have been, the film is highly entertaining for what it is and the filmmaking is skillful."
" A excellent Horror gem, classic!!
",0.0,0.4383,2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"I'm a big horror fan and this is the best little horror yarn I've seen in ages. Jane Doe is an excellent example that good horror movies are still being made. Top notch story, effects and scares. Highly recommended. Well acted, with some recognisable faces. Brian Cox is great as the small town coroner that leads the autopsy on the titular body, in one scene he even managed to give me a sad lump in the throat which was an unexpected feeling during an unnerving horror flick. Emile Hirsch plays his son and assistant and though he's good doesn't have as much impact as Cox. Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton) makes an appearance as the town sheriff.Where this film really succeeds is in doing something a lot of modern horror has forgotten about - it toys with the viewers imagination, creating an uneasy feeling out of the narrative, half light, sound and shadow. This is not to say you don't get to see anything grotesque or unsettling, as certain scenes are not for the squeamish.I don't want to spoil the story but will say this, the resolution is not quite as good as the build up. It's very hard for a horror film, especially one that plays on fear and the imagination, to deliver a conclusion that is suitably unsettling - this one half succeeds. But the ride is more than worth it and the ending is far from a failure.If you like horror, watch this."
" Horror for true horror fans
",-0.6808,-0.9209,2017-02-05 00:00:00,9,"Modern day horror is rarely scary anymore, but rather just disgusting. If you're a fan of intense gore, this movie is not for you. I nearly skipped this movie due to the name alone, figuring a movie about an autopsy would have to be disgusting. The other reviews have explained the story, but with this film the less you know ahead of time, the better. From the beginning to the end there is a sense of extreme dread. I had to stop the movie twice- once to turn the light on, the other to drag my husband in to sit next to me so I wouldn't have to finish the movie alone. If you enjoy being scared in movies, you will not be disappointed!"
" Great horror movie
",0.1027,0.8763,2017-02-04 00:00:00,10,"My favorite genre of movies is horror and I rarely miss any. I found The Autopsy of Jane Doe to be somewhat original, different, and just flat out entertaining. There's never duel moments like what you get with a lot of horror movies. It's not like the same crap that gets redone over and over again, such as home invasion, exorcism, etc. movies. I'm not saying you will love the movie like I did, but highly recommend giving it a look. I didn't find the movie to be extremely scary but it had its moments. Actors did a great job and the ending was amazing. In my opinion I would consider this film to be horror movie of the year without a doubt."
" Surprising Plot!
",0.3382,-0.8364,2017-02-03 00:00:00,7,"I see a lot of reviewers calling this a ""horror"" flick. But considering that most horror flicks today are polished B- Movies and can't get an IMDb user rating above a 5, I find that referring to this little gem as a horror movie is giving off the wrong impression.This is more of a scary psychological thriller.The plot is surprisingly fresh and has the viewer's eyeballs ""glued"" to the screen on the ""WTF?!?!"" factor and sustained the intense suspense from beginning thru the rolling ending credits across the screen. The gore is minimal but the ""creepy"" factor is fairly high on this little doozy of a flick. You wont be disappointed."
" Good... But not good enough.
",-0.4782,0.9176,2017-01-29 00:00:00,6,"Interesting film but it's a toughie. We thought the film could have been a lot more exciting. The end was pretty awful as we were left confused and not hungry for more. Sam says the woman in the film is butterz and teeth like football studs although pretty decent chest (spoiler) and the man wasn't quite tickling my pink either. The old man was an old tiger though. Bottom line - if you're bored, watch it. If you're searching for something to watch with a loved one, or to impress or even as a family horror film, take the extra 5 minutes to search for something more arousing.It's a 6 from Len."
" Emphasis on Creeps, not Scares
",0.2584,0.1587,2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"This film was actually quite a nice change from the usual slew of samey stuff that comes out under the horror genre these days.The emphasis is on creeps rather than scares - don't expect to leap off your seat, but do expect to be on the edge of it a few times. I personally felt a bit let down in places - there would be a build up to some expected horror, which actually then didn't transpire/wasn't as bad as I was fearing. That spoiled it for me a bit.Some of the dialogue and characters are quite cheesy, but I like a bit of cheesiness in my horror films - if you do too, then it simply adds to the fun! Sometimes the characters' reactions are a bit unbelievable, but the acting is still quite good.The story is simple but good - a body arrives at a morgue grotesque yet puzzling circumstances, and terrible things start to happen. This was an entertaining story that keeps you interested. The storytelling is a bit rushed in places, but the ending has a good wee hook to it, which made up for some of the other shortcomings!"
" A pretty good idea
",0.7269,-0.6666,2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,"This movie's story isn't actually a bad idea! I love the fact that it's about a topic that isn't too cliché, however, the small predictable scenes kind of ruined the fun. Things that didn't need to happen that did: - Girlfriend didn't really need to be accidentally axed to death, there was minimal reaction to this and it was so unrealistic - Cat didn't need to be found mangled, then within 2 seconds, receive a neck snap, no questions asked, again with no realistic reaction from characters - Morgue bodies didn't really need to start walking about again like zombies - Being trapped in a storm without electricity or signal on the phone (obviously)Things that needed to happen that didn't: - More history on the witch - More cool facts about the dates and possibilities of what happened to the witch - Tie the loose ends about her links with the characters she was involved withI loved the music, the unusual scenes, the CSI style findings and whatnot, I wish there had been more story and less jump scares."
" Instant Classic
",0.0,0.9831,2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"I originally gave this movie a 7 out of 10 before going back and changing it to a 9/10. I loved it the moment I finished it. Before I even finished it really. Days later, when it was still on my mind from time to time, I realized just how great of a movie this truly is. Not only will this be one of my favorite horror movies this year, but I think this should be on every list of classics. The mystery is great. The ending is great. I honestly don't have a single bad thing to say about this movie other than it could've kept going and still had my rapt attention. The acting is on point. The setting is so realistic yet super creepy. The story though. It draws you in within the very beginning and you will not be able to look away. It does not have a vintage feel. At least not to myself, yet it did remind me of older horror movies. Movies that rely on the story and the acting, not all the big Hollywood CGI and over the top theatrics."
" A Welcome Surprise in a Sea of Bad New Horror
",-0.4767,0.9967,2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"This is a film that kind of snuck up on me from out of nowhere. I hadn't heard of it, seen any trailers, or even come across it while browsing streaming sites. Usually these kinds of films really need the Independent festival circuit to generate buzz, and still, I hadn't heard of it from any of them. I was told through a friend that I should check it out because it was awesome, and when I did a little digging, it turns out that there are actually a lot of people who really like it, even though it's received practically zero promotion. Still, new horror films have not been sitting well with me as of late, even if a director I admire is behind the camera. So I still went in with some reservations and other than the fact that it starred Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch, and was from Troll Hunter director Andre Ovredal, I knew nothing else about it so I went in fairly cold.I really, really liked this one a lot. There are so many unique touches that makes this one stand out from the crowd of most new horror stuff, either in the low-budget DTV market or big budget theatrical releases. For one, the story is quite unique. The dead body of a girl is brought into the morgue late at night under mysterious circumstances. Immediately the father and son coroners suspect something is aloof and that things just aren't adding up. The story is told through the coroner's discovery of every new detail they find, and how odd these details seem to be. Through experience and some research, they slowly begin to unravel what's really going on with this perfect female specimen that's laying dead on their table. For me, this was one of the biggest and best things TAoJD has going for it. By taking an unconventional approach to telling the story, we're going along for the ride as the story progresses with each new discovery. It's a novel idea and one I hadn't seen before where the majority of the film takes place inside this one room. You'd think that it wouldn't be very interesting, or the single location idea could wear thin after a while, but trust me, it doesn't.I feel that a lot of what makes this so successful as a film is director Andre Ovredal. For a film that has so many constraints such as shooting primarily in a single room, and repeatedly showing a dead body on the table, he really does a fantastic job of making it look stylish and interesting. He never uses the same camera setup or reuses any previous shots. Somehow he's able to make it look slick and repeatedly finds ways to shoot it differently than the previous scene. It's pretty damn impressive if you ask me (and I know you are not), and keeps the film consistently interesting visually and aesthetically.Aside from being a great looking film, one of the things that took me by surprise is where the story ultimately leads to. It's nothing hinted at in the beginning, and it was a nice twist that really caught me off guard in a good way. I won't spoil it for you, but there are elements to the story that really move it into a direction I had not anticipated and it only made it better.This one of the biggest films to come out in some time that really has people divided. When I mentioned this on Facebook, it got a lot of people interested who hadn't seen it yet. On the plus side, it got a lot of them to track it down and watch it immediately, but on the negative side, it really surprised me that a good half of them thought it was just okay. Those that didn't like it much based it on that they didn't find it scary. But really, what films are these days? Those that did love it did so because of how well it was made, and how different it was in it's execution. I fall into the latter category. I loved it and I hope you will too.It's difficult to discuss this film any further without potentially giving away too many key plot points that you should really discover on your own. It's more fun that way. So I'll leave it here and just tell you that of all the new horror I've seen recently, this is easily the best of the bunch and a very welcome surprise."
" lemme scream for a sec
",-0.4019,0.8861,2017-01-27 00:00:00,6,"actually i kinda wanted to watch this long ago but it didn't really attract me so i'd never really thought about it until my teacher at school played it to us. Once you watch it, you can't ever stop. This movie has done its job to bring out the scary and horror nuance. First 30 minutes was so interesting and enjoyable (though i cant stand bloods tbh) but then it went not too good from there. There were some non-enjoyable scenes like the zombie,etc. I don't know why but it kinda didn't make sense to me. And tbh im not sad when the ... died and tbh i don't even care. Characters were not stand out and just meh. But I have to say that this movie is original and stand out. I really like the last few scenes, it was a bit unpredictable and I hope they make a prequel to it because i need it. No. WE need it. It could've been better though and I wish they could've tell us about the girl's background story."
" Boring, not scary, overrated
",0.0844,-0.9971,2017-01-24 00:00:00,3,"** spoiler alert **I watched this movie with a big expectation, based on the high rating this movie has got on IMDb and other movie sites. I never wrote a review before, but this highly overrated movie had stolen my precious 90 minutes that will never come back!As a thriller/horror fan, I have watched thousands of films of this genre, so I know what to expect from a decent horror film. The Autopsy of Jane Doe was promising to be a good and original horror flick, however, the script and the plot were pretty bad, starting downhill from the second half of the movie till the end. It become so boring, even a dark and creepy atmosphere, acting of Brian Fox and Emile Hirsch and a few jump scares could not save this movie.** spoiler alert **Some scenes were illogical and pretty annoying, like :Instead of writing down or record all the strange things they found in the body of Jane Doe and leave it to the police, they started to questioning the mystery, trying to connect all evidences they found and solve the mystery by themselves until its too late. While in the beginning we learned that the father knew to never cross the line. Why?!You just don't set a corps on fire, of burn a dead body in an autopsy table, especially if you know that the family of the dead person and the police (in this case) would claim it.When the father accidentally kill the girl friend of his son, you would expect that the son would be devastated, mad at his father, or at least shown his anger and blame his father. Instead, he didn't do anything but following his father wherever he goes like nothing happened. So unconvincing. Bad acting, bad script.After the girl has accidentally been killed, they were hanging around in the same rooms again and again, trying to understand what actually happened to Jane Doe, like nothing happened. An innocent girl died, for gods sake, and what they do was running to the autopsy room to solve the mystery?!Why didn't they call the police, or 911?? Don't tel me they don't have telephone connection or cell phone.Why did the father - out of nothing - try to make a connection with Jane Doe, a dead and soulless body he once believed, to spare his son?The idea of having a witch on your autopsy table is really brilliant and original, but that is not enough. Poor execution has certainly ruined almost everything in this movie. Shame. And the high score? I just don't get it."
" Finally something new in the horror genre!
",-0.6114,0.7835,2017-01-24 00:00:00,7,"Nowadays sadly it's really hard to find out a(horror)movie with an original plot and such an interesting story. The idea of the whole movie to take place in the morgue is actually something that we haven't seen and that's even better because it makes you feel like you are in there with the cast. In addition to that, the special effects are outstanding.There are some scenes (quite graphic) that are able to make you feel like you are watching a real anatomy class. The only reason that I put 7 instead of 8 or 9 was because of the ending.(don't worry I won't say anything) It wasn't bad but the way that the film ends kind of destroys the originality of the film since it is not something so special. Nevertheless this doesn't mean that you should skip this specific movie. If you want to spend an hour and a half in a horror movie that actually turns out to be one of the best of it's year then this film is what you need!"

Was the ***** trying to return home so killing people until she gets back to ""The North East"", was she killing people to achieve life again or is she trapped and destined to kill without any kind of end in sight. It almost feels like it has been set up for a sequel where all will be answered but at the same time it doesn't feel like a sequel kind of film. In my opinion though, give it a watch."
" Give me an 'Autopsy of Jane Doe'!
",0.0,-0.9908,2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"I'm always a sucker for pretty much any horror movie. Rarely though, horror films tend to stick in my mind long after viewing that have a lingering haunting effect that will cause me to sweat or choose not to walk down a dark hallway. I'm happy to say that the fresh and original horror film 'The Autopsy of Jane Doe' will terrify me for the coming weeks. Directed by André Øvredal (Trollhunter), and starring Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox, this horror masterpiece goes down some dark alleys while a father and son try to reconnect after a death in the family.Set inside a family owned morgue and autopsy center lab, father and son Tony and Austin Tilden (Cox and Hirsch respectively) tend to the recently deceased bodies in their seemingly small town. The local police officer brings a new body of a young woman down to the morgue late in the night that causes Tony and Austin to stay after hours and find out the C.O.D. or cause of death for this dead young woman. They soon find out that there are no marks on her body or evidence that she is actually dead.After cutting her open and inspecting her insides further, a sinister presence enters the picture into some truly terrifying clues as to just what's setting off the strange things that happen to Austin and Tony. Underlying the horror of it all is the relationship between father and son, as they both try to cope with moving on from a close one's death. André Øvredal has perfectly crafted his camera to pick up every nuance of horror around every corner here, whether it be a being lurking around the corner, footsteps behind a door, or some fleshy gore – it all looks phenomenal and scary-as-hell.Hirsch and Cox turn in excellent performances too that allows you to bond with this father and son instantly with their charm and pranks. There is a genuine love between the two throughout the movie, which makes it more difficult to see them go through what the end up being in the middle of. 'The Autopsy of Jane Doe' is one horror film that will last forever and scare the hell out of you.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Bleak & Truly Scary
",-0.0772,0.6214,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a definite must see for horror and movie fans looking to catch up on the best of what 2016 offered. The ""Jane Doe"" subject in this film is a woman found partially unearthed in the basement of a town house where a massacre has taken place. She is transported to the local morgue where our father/son duo is met. The introductory banter between the two feels real giving a viewer a pretty quick level of likable personality in our main characters. This movie takes it's time dimming the lights and focusing our ears & eyes into the horror that enfolds throughout. Once the movie begins the tension is hard to handle, the outcome is imminent, the hopelessness settles and from there you can really only hope for the best before the inevitable worst. The movie is paced incredibly well and is over before you've realized an hours passed. My only gripe with the movie is a seasoned horror fan will see the outcome and set up from a mile away however, due to the great acting, setting and on point cinematography the experience is endearing."

The acting from the two main characters in the show was exceptional.Don't listen to the negative reviews, I never do, i like to judge a film for myself.An easy 8/10 stars!"
" Dead Woman Tells a Tale
",-0.6486,-0.9788,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"I know it's your job, but be careful of opening Pandora's BOX. Talk about classic horror. The Autopsy of Jane Doe reminds me of the good ole days of real horror movies. When found footage was not a thing, clichéd jump scares were minimal and mysteries needed to be solved to survive. This self-contained story of a father/son pair of coroners is a great return to those days. It's pure horror. Not a comedy, drama or think- piece. It's a simple tale of two men trying to do their undertaking but getting in way over their heads when their subject is, as the title advises, a Jane Doe with more questions than answers.A family is found brutally slaughtered in their home leaving the police baffled while a woman is (literally) found unearthed. This woman is brought to the Tilden Morgue and Crematorium as the first body to have an autopsy to explain how the family died. Father and son begin their routine, but thenwell, it wouldn't be a horror movie if these two weren't trapped downstairs in their ""office"" and weird things happen.The movie can be vicious at times, simplistic and frustrating since so many questions appear in such a short running time. But, simultaneously, it's satisfying since it's been a long while since I've seen pure horror.And most horror films these days play on movie tropes that bring in the bucks. Over and over, I see the same things to the point it's not only unfrightening, it's boring. Now, this picture isn't perfect and some of it is, sadly predictable, but as a relatively quick, scary mystery, it does its job.***Final thoughts: At first glance, I thought the son was cute and wondered if this was an up-and-coming star. Nope. Only at the end credits did I learn that was Emile Hirsch. Wow. I haven't seen him in a movie in years and he has grown. Oh, and the father was played by the always-incredible Brian Cox who also added some credibility to the small cast."
" Just didn't wow me like it did others.
",-0.6348,0.673,2017-01-20 00:00:00,5,"Maybe I had too high of hopes for this film, having seen it advertised all over my Facebook feed for numerous weeks. Hearing the rave reviews made me want to check it out. So great job marketing people.Or maybe I've just watched too many horror movies. Or maybe what Jane Doe turns out to be just happens to be my favorite subject to read and watch movies about, so I saw the clues early on. Whatever the case, I just wasn't as wowed as other people seem to be.There were definitely creepy parts, such as when things opened in the morgue. And at times the atmosphere of the basement did feel sinister. A lot of the cinematography was done beautifully, but I need to have a good story to go along with all the pretties.I had no problem with Jane Doe being naked on the table almost the entire movie, but after about a half an hour, I kept thinking, that actress has to be so cold. Not something you want to be continually thinking about while watching a movie.I wouldn't say rush to watch it, but if you're really curious as to what all the fuss is about, then give it a go."
" Absolutely brilliant
",0.624,-0.9937,2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"Where to begin ..... this is a fantastic horror movie , Emile has done some not great films lately but this one is great the acting between the son and dad was great the suspense was incredible. I ant give it a 10 because a movie has to be amazing in every part where as this is a great film it did show some parts that didn't feel right like when the dad gets locked in the bathroom and attacked they never really mention it to each other and with it being the start of bad stuff to happen you'd have thought they would have been a bit more like wtf just happened. I really didn't like the part with the girlfriend dying as it was slightly unrealistic as to how she got down their in the first place and when that happened I knew whatever happened in the end that the characters wouldn't go on to lead the lives they had planned so I knew from that moment that dad and son probably wouldn't survive that being said I was shocked when Emiles character died at the end as it seemed his dad may have saved him.but I was thinking how is this guy going to explain it to the police they would think that he killed both his dad and girlfriend and end up in a loony asylum. So killing them all was probably best for the movie overall as it is just a horror movie and I guess that's the point in the end to not feel happy at the end to leave you still creep ed out you don't want to sleep. The film reminded me of when I first watched 1408 with john cusack it had the same vibe to me a lot of the way through in some ways I thought at the end that it may seem nothing had happened and was thinking maybe they would all be OK in the end or think they were going to be OK . Anyway I think people will love this movie it moves at a fast enough pace for me it is all set in the one building really with mainly just 2 actors and a corpse so to hold my interest like it did is a job well done . Has the creep factor and the scare factor."
" From the director of Trollhunter comes one of the scariest horror films of this year! // Instagram: moviesmaniax
",-0.6114,0.9143,2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"From the director of Trollhunter comes one of the scariest horror films of this year! The Autopsy of Jane Doe takes us on a terrifying journey through the two coroners (Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch) in finding out the cause of death of this mysteriously beautiful corpse ""Jane Doe"". The film does a great job in hinting and playing with the audience and keeping them on the edge of their seats before revealing the twist that is, unfortunately, much better than the resolution and the final act of the story. Still, the whole build-up is thrilling and SCARY enough to make us forgive the final act as well as some cliché moments and delivers a spine-chilling haunted house thrill with a unique setting in the morgue this time around. The film also shows the full autopsy scene that's so cringely satisfying and GORY and is definitely not for the weak stomach. Overall, The Autopsy of Jane Doe succeeds in its genuinely suspenseful and cringely intriguing build-up with some forgivable bumps and cliché along the way and ultimately ends up being one of the most thrilling and scariest films of the year.

" Creepy B movie that carries some elements from Japanese horror
",-0.5719,-0.9907,2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"When I started this movie up, I was expecting another exploitation movie. Kind of like ""Deadgirl"" (2008) with a lot of nudity and sexual tones that leans towards it being controversial. But to my surprise this was more horror and supernatural over it being focused more on exploitation. Sure, there is a unidentified dead girl and she is nude most of the way through. But it didn't seem to exploit the actress with it constantly focusing on sexual aspects of it. As a matter of fact this was like watching a B movie with the vibe being similar to Japanese horror. I wouldn't have been surprised if this was done by a Japanese director. Because it sure seemed to have been inspired by Asian horror movies. So the story is about a father who is a cynical coroner and his son who is his assistant. That work with investigations through autopsies to figure out how some people might have died. And they are professional about their job but bizarre and strange things start to happen when they start to perform an autopsy on a unidentified girl. The actress did a professional job, it must not have been easy pretending to be dead for long hour while being nude. What stood out about the characters is how the father is very cynical about everything, even when strange subtle things starts to pop up. So he is dismissive about every weird occurrences until things start to escalate. The horror elements isn't anything all that new, but the atmosphere is shot very well and the setting is grimy and gruesome looking. The stench of dead bodies seemed like was coming out of the screen. Even the music was creepy as hell, especially when it came to the songs from the radio. It sounded like it was something out of the ""Silent Hill"" video games. Like one of those happy go lucky songs that sounds very creepy while having that happy tone to it. Overall, this is a okay movie if you are in the mood for a alright horror flick.6/10"
" Smart!
",0.4574,0.9874,2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"Such an interesting and creative movie! I like it better than The VVITCH.The ending holds great potential for a prequel or a sequel, explaining how the body ended up in that house in the opening scene, or what happens next.The story is so suspenseful and unsettling. A corpse with lots of severe internal damage but not a scratch on the surface? Wow!My friend and I both loved it!The movie sends a perfect message: Don't take a morgue worker for a boyfriend.Morgue workers over the world, I recommend this movie to you all.It will make your Halloween splendid! :)"

This was a very good and entertaining movie, a clever story that was well acted, it also has quite a good scare factor and will almost certainly have some peeps hiding behind the sofa.I knew where the movie was going early on but it kept me questioning myself throughout and me eyes firmly locked onto the screen in-case i missed a vital clue ! Welcome to my collection ""Autopsy of Jane Doe""Pleasantly surprised by this little Winner !"
" What a proper horror movie should be !
",-0.6114,0.8888,2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"I thought they were done with making these kinds of movies. I merely expected it to be some clichéd script with cheap jump scares. Oh boy, how wrong I was and how surprising this movie turned out to be.Here's the plot summary, A coroner and his son receive a dead women's body for autopsy and just when they think it's just another murder/suicide, things start to get creepier. And it doesn't just dim down as the movie progresses. The movie simply gets intense and scarier every time it gets to show what it's hiding for the audience. The atmosphere is immersive and before anything even happens you are left with a feeling of things to come. There are some terrifying moments and jump scares but the anticipation is what's worth watching it. The movie paces almost perfectly and the background score is sure to raise some tension.Brian Cox is always a pleasure to watch but Emile Hirsch comes off great as his likable son. The relationship between the father-son duo is heart tearing to watch as the movie unfurls its deepest and darkest part. 2016 had its fair share of horror movies but ended with this gem of a horror. Turn off the lights, sit back and enjoy this flick."
" I keep watching it
",0.0,0.9619,2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"I have to say if you like intelligent horror, this is your movie, acted wonderfully, it grabs you and won't let go. I never write reviews, because most films don't have the depth to keep me interested after I have figured them out, but if you get a chance to watch this piece of art, DO!!!! I have watched this at least 10 times in order to find things I may have missed. The young lady who plays Jane Doe needs to win some sort of award for playing a corpse. The father and son show a love you rarely see in film. I can only ask that the producers make a prequel and a sequel. There is so much more story to tell. You know you can tell an excellent film when there are only three main characters and one of them is dead."
" Excellent ""not so well known"" horror film
",-0.317,-0.5023,2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"I am an absolute horror movie buff. Unfortunately, like many others, there are a lot, and I mean a lot of terrible horror films. However, this one is far from that category. We found this movie on Apple TV and were skeptical at first. But, when the movie started we were immediately pulled in. Great scares, high tension scenes and plenty of moments where you want to pull the blankets over your eyes. The plot isn't going to twist and turn you in many directions, but it will definitely keep you entertained until the very end. I won't say anymore than this. It's a horror film set in the basement of a morgue. Enough said."
" Jane Doe
",0.0,0.2937,2017-01-12 00:00:00,6,"As I started watching this movie,it was a big surprise for me. I thought this is not gonna be classic horror movie which uses jump-scare scenes and trashy scary music to scare the audience. The story was interesting and promising.First 45-50 minutes of this movie was great; great acting, soundtrack and after that all aspects that made a good movie have fallen apart and turned into a another stereotypical low-budget movie.I gave him 6/10 because of first half of the movie,and that's it. I would not recommend it for you to watch,but it is just my humble opinion."
" Fantastic Mystery/Horror!!
",0.6351,-0.7562,2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"Watching the trailer to this film I already had a good feeling going into it, even though trailers are often misleading. I am a horror movie fan & in recent years truly worthy horror films are few & far between among the many released each year. This film & it's trio main cast brings a very intimate & creepy story worth watching! I can't think of much wrong with it besides a few small things that would lead into spoilers. What the film did right outweighs any small negative opinions. It's creepy mood & suspense is spot on & the uneasy feelings stay throughout. I also found the unraveling of the mystery behind ""Jane Doe"" engaging & often surprising! This is definitely one of the horror films that hit it's mark!"
" wow...my favorite horror of 2016.....
",-0.1779,0.9949,2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"...alongside ""the girl with all the gifts"". before i go on...be warned and this goes for viewers of horror movies who think they're desensitized...and...if you're squeamish...don't even bother watching this movie as great as it is. that's right....it's great. what i mean about squeamish is that some horror movies you can close your eyes or glance away for a few seconds and still get the gist of the movie. this gem of a horror you can't do that...the clues are in the autopsy itself..there's nothing left to ones' imagination. one can look away or close ones' eyes' if one is watching with someone who has a strong stomache and can explain whats going on tho. but that's not even the least of it...the film also has moments of dread and suspense enough to make you bite and chew through all ten fingernails....lol. suspense and dread as strong as ""the conjuring"", especially the basement scenes.what a treat this was, i watched ""the girl with all the gifts"" and then ""the autopsy of jane doe"" one after the other. these 2 horror movies are 2 of the best in the last decade in my opinion...i gave both movies 8 stars but...i had to turn on all the lights 1/2 way through ""the autopsy of jane doe"", yah..it creep me out that much. thank goodness i didn't smoke up for jane doe...i don't think i would have been able to take it and i'm not talking about the explicit gore...that feeling of dread was...i don't even know how to explain. but i also had a grin on my face big time too.2 great horrors but "" the girl "" didn't have the feeling of dread like "" jane doe "" even though it was a great movie also. forget about it being great horror..just a very very very good movie in general. brian cox and emile hirsch were great in this movie and they better be for the movie to be this good and enjoyable. not to be missed for true fans of horror and just good movies in general. what a good year for horror movies 2016 was."
" creepy and gory
",0.0,0.9493,2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,The title is exactly what this flick is all about. At a crime scene the cops discover a corpse that has nothing to do with the crime. Body full intact it supposed to be an easy autopsy to find out who Jane Doe is.But it wouldn't be a horror if this doesn't turn out the way they should. This flick is so simple but slowly it moves into a creepy flick full with questions about the body. The effects used are stunning and the autopsy is shown in full bloom so it's gory as hell. But the use of the camera slowly zooming in on the face gives this flick a creepy atmosphere and the excellent performances makes it even better. This flick is another gem that's out there without any promotion. The thing is I can't go into the story not to spoil a thing but if you are in into an excellent gory horror then this really is a must see.Gore 4/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5
" Straight up creepshow; somewhat hackneyed
",0.2263,0.9335,2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"I thought this might turn out to be a medium-to-high-toned whodunit, ultimately grounded in a sturdy materialism, but it winds up being a fairly standard-issue supernatural horror romp. Lots of creepy music setting up horror sting moments. Practically every time the son sticks his nose in some dark crevasse or other, I find myself saying, ""Hey! Can't you hear that creepy music? Are you *really* unaware that something's about to jump out at you?""But the amazing part is that I watched it through to the end. Not to say that I'm a completely satisfied customer, but... Well, here's the scorecard:The treatment is nicely directed and acted. Good production, all 'round: Decent writing, good sets, lighting, costuming, filming, sound, editing, pacing. Quite watchable, even in spite of the occasional hackneyed clichés of the genre sticking out like sore thumbs.One noteworthy point is that 95% of the hour-and-a-half running time takes place in a sort of underground bunker, and most of that in one room. Which makes it sort of like a parlor piece. If that thought brings on twinges of claustrophobia, you've been warned.Not gonna recommend, but... if you recognize the movie I describe as your kind of cinematic thing, then have at it!"
" Grossly overrated
",-0.2263,-0.9678,2017-01-07 00:00:00,4,"I went to this film with very high expectations. And for the first quarter my expectation were met. Here was a father-and-son duo that were thoroughly likable horror protagonists, and they spent a good amount of time explaining the intricacies of an autopsy. After that, the film fell flat.The horror element in the movie was surprisingly far-fetched, un- scary, and even downright ludicrous. And the fact that the father- and-son team, two very logical men who have been dissecting normal bodies all their careers, took it in their stride, is doubly ludicrous.This movie also makes some objectionable plot choices. Human sacrifice, a sad and horrific truth of past civilizations and cult groups, should not be romanticized by showing that it preserves beauty. Either that, or the director got it mixed up with vampirism? The result is, nonetheless, confusing and not in the least bit terrifying.Sadly, none of the characters, despite being likable, could leave a lasting impression as they rushed through the general 'procedure' of dealing with a horror crisis. The only thing I sympathized with in this movie was the cat.4/10"
" Olwen Kelly gives it welly
",0.0516,0.9829,2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"When the beautiful corpse of a mysterious girl is found half-buried in the basement of a murder house, the coroner's scalpel uncovers a terrible secret ...Truly brilliant concept for a horror: an intriguing mystery draws the heroes from their safe normality into an inescapable trap of supernatural frights within a claustrophobic labyrinth. The story drops us right into scenes of gore but with the assurance that the investigators are in control, and then the darkness closes in with the mesmerising corpse on the slab. The autopsy procedures are handled well, bringing us along at a good pace - although without the full macabre delivered by a well known teaching video that used to be on liveleak. Sadly, the story goes off the boil in the second act - maybe the writers lacked the daring to avoid conventional tricks and explanations - and an unlikely killing leaves too many questions unanswered, draining the adrenalin from the viewing experience. The reanimated corpses don't deliver the expected chills, and the biblical exposition is ho-hum. In the end it feels silly - an example of story tellers not taking their horror seriously, leaving the juicy fruits unplucked.The photography and editing are gorgeous, but the one outstanding feature of this movie is Olwen Kelly playing the ice-cool corpse: blessed with a beautiful and fascinating ability for the close-up - gonna be a star. Other performances are good, and until about halfway through it looked like this would be Brian Cox's best movie since The Ring.The music is impressive, but the story telling relies on it too much.Overall: engrossing first half, but runs out of weird."
" Ignore the ""Good"" Reviews, They are Paid Bots
",-0.3612,-0.9788,2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"This movie was absolute GARBAGE.It started out good. The middle had good momentum, then the ending was what ruined everything. Nothing gets solved. NOTHING. They find out what she is, but that's it. Both protagonists die before anything can be done. It was ""creepy"" and ""disturbing"" but sh*t nonetheless. A Colossal waste of time. The people calling this film good were clearly paid to or worked on it. It was a stupid waste of time and fails to expand the characters. Nothing gets done to solve the problem of people being linked to the dead body. And the others find out nothing at the end either. Also 99% JUMP SCARE tactics. I want my hour and 30 minutes back."

The movie scared you on another level. It has a few holes in the plot but is perfectly written, directed and acted. I loved it and was truly shocked at how great this film was. A must watch for horror fans. Do not let your kids watch it. Scary film. I think there will be a sequel. At least I hope there will be. Very spooky ending. I would bury this thing in a lead lines coffin as far deep as humanly possible. Horror the old fashion way. Highly recommend. The Jane Doe is spooky just seeing her.

I went out without seeing the trailer, so I thought it was a police/detective movie at first.But it didn't take long for us to realize it was a horror movie. Acting : excellent. Bryan Cox and Emile Hirsh play a very believable pair of father-son, working at the family morgue. Story : very different from the usual horror movies. I appreciated it, as I grew tired of the same ghosts, zombie, vampire stories.Directing : smart use of the shadows without being excessive. I highly recommend it."
" Short review of The Autopsy of Jane Doe
",0.0,0.9803,2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,The Autopsy of Jane Doe its quite normal horror movie but cant say that it was good enough because i was hoping more from André Øvredal. His last movie Trollhunter was really good and i totally love it i think that it was the best Norwegian movie i ever seen before. But The Autopsy of Jane Doe was more Hollywood movie because script was quite banal and there was too much jump scare scenes. What i like in this movie it was the actors Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox. Also the place where all movie is filmed is quite scary and old so i really liked this director choice. So all in all this movies wasn't the best work from André Øvredal but it was a quite good horror movie.One of the best horror movies this year.
