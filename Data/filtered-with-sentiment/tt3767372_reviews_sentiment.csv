" A big 'No'
",0.0,0.1779,2021-03-15 00:00:00,1,Lost interest halfway and then fast forwarded it till it ended.Absolute rubbish of a film.
" A movie about our true life !!
",0.5242,0.6124,2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,It's such a beautiful movie. It talks about reality in a relationship between a daughter and a father. Sometimes needy sometimes independent.Small scenes (which mince no theatrics and talk only what is real) are abundant and in perfect harmony.This movie feels -- A video shot of real life and shown to audience.
" Good Movie See it
",0.4404,0.3767,2021-01-26 00:00:00,6,I was OK movie but nothing special but it is family movie I recommended. It is quite simple but emotional .
" Best movie
",0.6369,0.9876,2021-01-04 00:00:00,10,I think it's best movie of 2015. Story line is simple but it's engaging it's characters are annoying father caring daughter and man his love towards the heroine but fears to express it . This is the daily life occuring events that events are shown in simply amazing way. It's story direction especially sircar and juhi's screenplay is simply amazing that fear of dying in all humans that is shown through one character that is simply awesome. Overall a excellent movie
" Beautiful movie

" Its about constipation

" Loved Piku
",0.5994,0.9408,2020-07-11 00:00:00,9,"Piku is a very good and unique movie. This movie is about old parents. How they should be treated by their child. Liked the jokes about constipation. Amibabh, Irfaan and Deepika nailed it. Jishu was also good. Liked the direction. Bollywood should make this kind of movies more than movies like Soty 2."

Sujith sircar direction, juhi screenplay and dialogue is just amazing and most importantly performance by the leads especially deepika padukone delivered best and brilliant performance üíï(and deserved national award for best actress )and amithab sir is as amazing as deepika and irrfan sir has done nice and honest job and other supporting character are good mainly moushimi mams..........

I will miss you irrfan khan
my heart is broken"
" Just watch it. Again. And again
",0.0,0.9686,2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,You can not just write a review for a film like this. This beautiful creation from Shoojit is a treat to watch (specially to the Bengalis). The two legends Amitabh and Irfan have done a marvellous job to keep the audience fresh and surprised. How can somebody laugh so much while hearing discussions about constipation? Watch the movie to get the answer. Right from the cinematography to the acting to the comic timing to the music to the dialogue deliveries to the every hook and corner... every this is great about this movie.
" Another exceptional by Shoojit Sircar.
",0.0,0.9136,2020-05-30 00:00:00,9,"Piku is blend of ambitious daughter, distraught father for constipation and simple man. It is simple movie where the Piku and her father Bhaskor Banerjee goes to a road trip to Calcutta alongside Rana. The constipation which is chronic to Bhaskor is followed on the road trip as well. The film follows small twists, funny joke and providing wholesome entertainment to the audience. This is one of best road trips drama made and to be watched."
" One of the best movies ever produced in Bollywood
",0.6369,0.9186,2020-05-20 00:00:00,10,Great great movie with amazing performances and captivating songs
" Funny and simply a reflection of innocence
",0.6705,0.7184,2020-05-18 00:00:00,8,The three actors which this movie focuses are the best in the in the industry. And the story of father and daughter is simply heart touching for it's simplicity. And at the end it makes a blow of agony and happiness simultaneously.
" Going through the movie is a nice experience!
",0.4753,-0.8058,2020-05-14 00:00:00,8,"Very nice movie. Irrfan khan was* such a effortless actor. sad, he is no more. Relationships are hard, be it partners,brothers,parents,childrens etc... no one understand no one. everyone bothers everyone. and one day people leave from other person's life and from their life also."
" Constipation Has Never Felt That Good Before
",-0.3412,0.9971,2020-05-03 00:00:00,7,"Some films have plots and some rely solely on star power but there are one genre of films which is not protected by surprising plots or star power but still win enormous accolade from audience because of simple narrative embedded in small humorous situations. Recently released Indian film ""Piku"" starring Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukune and Irrfan Khan belongs to such a genre. Some film critics are comparing simplicity of ""Piku"" with yesteryear cinematic creations of Hrishikesh Mukherjee but ""Piku"" is simple in different way seemingly filling the requirements of liberated working woman cum loyal daughter. In most of the scenes ""Piku"" seems successful but in forgettable portions it falters.
""Piku"" has been directed by Shoojit Sircar who got his quota of critical fame with ""Vicky Donor"". Shoojit Sircar belongs to such category of modern day Indian directors who crave for Western values wrapped in typical South Asian Indian culture. He presents this unique blend of movie making in way which successfully attracts both critics and masses but not without slight lose ends. With ""Piku"" he has directed legendry Amitab Bachchan first time and the kind of performance he has carved out of Amitabh Bachchan has been a dream of every actor since beginning of film making. You have to be very skilled and focused director to make an actor like Amitab Bachchan to do such a role where his larger than life persona takes a back seat and a new personality appears which is the exact requirement of director's vision. No doubt Shoojit Sircar must be praised with thundering applaud for his effort to bring a simple story with funny mixture of common human ailment of constipation on silver screen in this magnitude and style and ends with most beautiful, everlasting father-daughter relationship.
Some assume Mr. Amitabh Bachchan is playing his last innings but what an innings he is playing. As mentioned before the persona of The Amitabh Bachchan takes a back seat in ""Piku"" and a personality of very irritating Bengali old man named Bashkor Banerjee appears who is always sick and tired of his constant problem of constipation. For a moment you will completely forget that this man is The Amitabh Bachchan. We do not know whether his performance as Bashkor Banerjee will win him few nominations in the category of best actor or best supporting actor but his trophy is confirmed. With her startling resemblance with actual daughter of Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone looks like Amitabh's real daughter. The way she has responded in front of legendry actor Amitabh Bachchan and world famous Irrfan Khan, she has become my A-List actress with ""Piku"". With ever curious face and witty dialogues Irrfan Khan makes ""Piku"" a wholesome entertainer. In one of the scene in which Irrfan Khan explains Amitabh Bachchan the relation between position of human intestine and conventional technique of using W/C is worth of watching.
Overall ""Piku"" is well themed, performance oriented and entertaining cinematic piece which has a potential of becoming dolly of both masses and classes alike. Constipation has never felt that good before. Must Watch.

" Don't understand it, feel it
",0.0,0.9788,2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,"I usually don't watch dramas, but this is probably one of those, which hooked me up. It is rare to find these type of movies from bollywood nowadays. It's honest, straight forward, subtle and simple movie. If you're expecting masala entertainment, then sorry boi, it's not for you.It's one of those films, where you'll find natural acting. Amitabh Bachchan has done the best job. He's may be harsh and arrogant but extremely honest and clear about his actions. After the death of Irrfan Khan, i felt bad for him. He has done an amazing job alongside Big B. But the most surprising is Deepika Padukone. It is one of those films, where you'll find her acting acceptable.The direction, cinematography and screenplay are not needed to be explained. Everything is done very beautifully and realistically. Well done Shoojit da"
" Will miss you Irrfan
",-0.1531,-0.3484,2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,"Watched this one on the most tragic day for any cinema lover the day on which Irrfan left the world with a shock
Even those who used to look at talents by religion are mourning on his demise
I was looking for a proper day to watch this film or to say more clearly his whole filmography but it turned out to be the most saddest day
At last I just want to say
I watched this cause I want to celebrate the fact that he was from 'OUR Bollywood industry' and he was is will be the reply to those morons who say Bollywood is only trash and nothing else"
" Little overrated feel good movie
",0.3892,0.4019,2020-01-13 00:00:00,7,It's good movie Amitabh bacchan and Deepika stands out but definitely overrated by critics

" My Review!
",0.0,0.8829,2019-08-29 00:00:00,8,"One of the best simple movies I've ever. It covers many aspects of many different lives in an unbelievable gross way. Never could I imagine Bachchan sir could ever take up a role as in the movie. Great acting, as always. Irfan Khan suddenly shot up as one of my favourites in Bollywood. Would definitely watch it again!Peace Out!"
" Great film to watch
",0.6249,0.936,2019-05-27 00:00:00,8,"This movie manages to achieve that magical, perfect combination of humour and sentiment. The casting is flawless, and so are the performances. A real gem of a film, one of the year's best."
" Awesome smart movie
",0.7783,0.836,2019-05-19 00:00:00,9,"A wonderful movie after long time from Indian Cinema. Smart, simple and natural acting from Deepika, Irfaan and Mr. Amitabh.
It is a blend of almost all emotions. A must watchable movie."
" Heart warming movie....one of the best in Indian cinema
",0.7003,0.9962,2018-12-29 00:00:00,10,"Hats off to all the actors and above all to the director. Brilliant movie, beautifully described all characters. Lot of fun to watch, one can relate to every old age person in their family. How every elderly of house is suspicious of their maids & servants, scared of their deteriorating health, making fuzz of even a small sneeze, blaming everyone for some or the other thing, emotional blackmailing, etc. Piku is ideal daughter who takes care of her father no matter how insensitive he is towards her in public. There is this broad thinking of Bhaskor Banerjee ''marriage is for low IQ people, marriage should be with a purpose'' I totally agree, ""seva karna hai to apne parents ki karo, why to go somebody else house and take care of his parents!!"" Each and every bit of this movie is totally a joy ride, whether it's the expression, emotion or dialogue. Irfaan Khan is outstanding, effortless acting, delight to watch him in Rana Chaudhary's role. The smile he gave on Ganga Ghat and the conversation between him and Piku is a real icing on the cake. There are no words for Big B, he is just so brilliant, excellent, superb and what not. Can't think of anybody else as Bhaskor Banerjee. Real movie lovers will love this movie forever like me. Already watched it more than 200 times on Netflix. Songs are soothing, loved the sitar played in background. Go for it genuine movie lovers!!!"
" Priceless and subtle
",0.0,0.9231,2018-11-28 00:00:00,9,"Piku is subtle yet strong. Deepika, Amitabh and Irfaan prove how genuine as actors they are. Director Shoojit deserves a lot of appreciation, and so does Juhi Chaturvedi. The movies stands aside and upright in the market of big grand movies. Overall, the movie is perfection personified."
" Classic
",0.0,0.75,2018-09-17 00:00:00,9,I would always want to see Deepika as here. And hope Big B will keep on entertaining us with his versatility till the very end!
" One movie to reconnect with the Bong roots
",0.0,-0.5267,2018-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Any bong kid, away from home, struggling with aged parents will absolutely connect with this movie. The song, the scene where family was having dinner, it all reminded me of home. The buildings of Kolkata, the ghats, the homeopathy medicine box, so much to rekindle and reconnect.Bong girl and Delhi guy, with an aged childish parent. Incredible acting, heart warming story."
" Okay movie
",0.2263,0.784,2018-07-30 00:00:00,7,"The main actors did amazing here! The storyline wasn't that amazing, but the main actors made it funny in a weird way."
" Amazing Movie- Simply Natural
",0.743,0.9889,2018-06-27 00:00:00,10,This is by far one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen. Amitabh is extremely funny and natural. Deepika is great and Irfan as always has given a brilliant performance. Every character has performed beautifully. Very funny and emotional to the right proportion. Great direction and soothing music. Must watch!! :)
" A movie that you would want to see with your heart, not with your brain
",0.0772,0.7269,2018-04-24 00:00:00,7,"Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan - three of the finest actors of our times come together for a movie that is so heart-warming and refreshing with an unusual simplicity. This is not one of the ubiquitous action thrillers, brainy or corny movies that creates wonders at the box office. 'Piku' is a simple yet hilarious and take on the bowel problems that come with old-age.Focusing on the unusual topic of constipation, the story is a fulfilling one with its heart in the right place. Shoojit Sircar helms the movie with astonishing brilliance, a story which otherwise is nearly impossible to even think of bringing on screen.The music of the movie is surreal and transports you to the purity of the streets of Kolkata. A noteworthy fact about the movie is that it is not stuffed with unnecessary dance sequences and melodrama. It is the story of a parent and his child, narrated in the simplest of ways, which is why it is very relatable."
" 9/10
",0.0,0.6476,2017-12-01 00:00:00,9,What a blast! There is little plot to speak of but the three main performances hold the film together. Despite Bachchan having the showier role his one note mimicry pales in comparison to the nuanced and emotional Deepika. Irffan is the real standout as he steals numerous scenes with his deadpan and sardonic asides. His scenes with Deepika specially sizzle. Lovely photography of Kolkata too.Well worth watching 9/10
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9715,2017-11-29 00:00:00,10,I hope Bollywood would make more movies like Piku. A true masterpiece. Amitabh sir fantastic as usual and Irfan once again showed he is in a different category among Bollywood actors.. i thoroughly enjoyed the movie and this was the 3rd time i watched Piku !A round of applause to every members of Piku team.
