" Nuts to the Squirrels
",-0.3182,0.9313,2021-03-25 00:00:00,6,"Peter Bogdanovich is still pastiching other movies in what will probably prove his last feature. This time it's the garrulous romantic comedies of Woody Allen, with a non-stop jazz score and set among New York's chattering classes. The leading lady of course plays a hooker, there are rabbi jokes and it's all brought into the 21st Century with continuous steadicam photography, mobile phones and jokes about condoms. TV names like Jennifer Anniston rub shoulders with Bogdanovich veterans Cybill Shepherd, Tatum O'Neal and the always welcome Austen Pendleton."
" she's cringey that way
",0.0,-0.7814,2021-02-11 00:00:00,2,"Poots's accent and acting are distractingly awful. ruined the film for me. wilson, douglas and aniston dependable as always but not enough to fix this mess.all in all -- a nothing burger yawnfest that thinks slick dialogue and fast action will hide the vacuity, inanity and one unfortunate casting decision (a critical fumble). i saw it for free and still want my money back.painful. 2/10"
" funny enjoyable
",0.7003,0.8176,2020-11-15 00:00:00,10,"I love it, was fun to watch and it has something different and also owen and thats a 10"
" Squirrel to the nuts
",-0.3182,0.7705,2020-08-07 00:00:00,9,A wonderful movie with a great comedy I really enjoyed this film and I laughed so well many film genre with comedy but all films are not sense to laugh but it did.many characters involved and it's really really more funnable film I ever watched in Hollywood.
" An Enjoyable Mess
",0.1027,0.4822,2020-06-16 00:00:00,6,"She's Funny That Way has all the elements that Woody Allen would have knocked out of the park. Bogdonavitch barely gets to second base with his attempt. But there are good moments. Just about anytime Imogene Potts is delivering a line or reacting to the moment are highlights. Austin Pendleton was never better. Bogdonavitch can still use a camera, so even the group shots are interesting. And it's certainly fast paced. The lowlights? As usual, the Wilson brother who his horribly miscast as a director that women adore. He's predictably dreadful. What was surprising to me was an over the top bordering on annoying portrayal by Jennifer Anniston.
Lots of cameos. Lots of near screwball comedy set ups complete with slamming hotel doors and women hiding in the bathroom. This film could have been so much more. But it came across looking like it was shot in a week with no retakes or tweaking. Even so, it's still better than most."
" Solid Allen-style comedy
",0.4767,0.9632,2020-04-21 00:00:00,7,"It's not earth shattering, or Bogdanovich's best, but it's a fun, breezy movie with a few great laughs and a some nice bedroom farce stuff. I wasn't a fan of Poots at first, but she won me over in the end. Still not convinced the framing device worked, but maybe I'll change my mind if I see it again."
" Unfortunately NOT that funny, although acting is good and the characters are likeable, but this story sizzles out half way through
",0.1398,0.9913,2020-01-17 00:00:00,5,"I like the actors. The jokes are so so, not bad, not great. It is quite a charming romantic comedy story at the beginning, but it sizzles out half way through. There is no real chemistry between the love birds and the jokes start to wear thin a bit after a while. I kept watching it because the actors are good and the story was still charming, but it all felt a bit lacking spark and punch.You wont get really irritated by it, but you surely wont get really excited either watching it. My advice would be to skip it and watch any other (better) romantic comedy. May I advice ""How do you know"", with Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and (again) Luke Wilson."
" Unfunny all the way
",0.0,0.5419,2019-11-21 00:00:00,1,"It's just not funny. It feels like a farce written by two chatbots: the structure is there, but the laughs are signally absent."
" She's Funny That Way
",0.4404,0.8808,2019-11-20 00:00:00,5,"It shows the high regard director Peter Bogdanovich is held in. His low budget Woody Allen tinged farce has attracted an all star cast.Call girl Izzy is interviewed about her life as a muse to theatre director Arnold Albertson (Owen Wilson.) Izzy was hired as a call girl by the married Arnold at his Manhattan hotel. He then pays her $30,000 to get out of prostitution and pursue her goal of being an actress. This is something he has done with other hookers in the past.Later Izzy shows up for an audition in Arnold's play where his wife has the lead role much to Arnold's embarrassment.The writer of the play Joshua Fleet (Will Forte) falls for Izzy. The woman he is dating psychotherapist Jane Claremont (Jennifer Aniston) also happens to be Izzy's therapist. She later spots him with Izzy.Joshua's father who is a private investigator has been hired by another client of Izzy, a judge to follow her and and what she gets up to. The judge also happens to be a patient of Claremont.Eventually Arnold's wife finds out about Izzy and his generosity with other call girls.It is nice to see Bogdanovich directing again. This is a lightweight romp but unfortunately it is just too old fashioned.She's Funny That Way is very much set up like a stage play so it is no surprise that it is set in the world of theatre. It needed the big set pieces of What's Up Doc although it has some call backs to the golden age of cinema."
" Imogen Poots' NYC accent in ""She's Funny That Way"" is England's revenge for Dick Van Dyke's cockney accent in Mary Poppins
",-0.5859,0.9125,2019-05-19 00:00:00,5,"Her accent is an abomination. Imogen Poots makes Fran Drescher sound like Meryl Streep. Her diction was a constant irritant, ruining every scene she was in.
How did she even get cast? They say she was cast at the last minute because of her quirky charm. Bogdanovich assumed she could do the accent, since all British actors are so well trained.
I can believe that the audience at the Venice film Festival loved ""She's Funny That Way "" - they had subtitles, so they didn't have to listen to Imogen Poots."
" I love this film!
",0.6696,0.9537,2019-05-05 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this old-fashioned screwball comedy and was surprised it was directed by Peter Bogdanovich (so nice he still calls Cybill!). Fabulous acting--Imogen Poots is a new favorite, having just seen Frank &Lola (as is Kathryn Hahn). See other posts for more critical reviews and analyses. I just say ""fun flick""!"
" Playlful movie that keeps you grinning
",0.3612,0.9038,2019-04-24 00:00:00,9,"This film is clever, quick-paced, and really well-acted. A fun romp. Certainly worth a watch. You will know within the first 30 minutes if it is not for you. For me, it
is a breath of fresh air."
" But not funny ""ha-ha"".
",-0.4782,0.1406,2019-04-16 00:00:00,2,"So much effort by so many people put into making this flat boring mess.
Yes there are a lot of pretty people to look at, and so many famous people. But, Ick. Just ick."
" Very funny movie
",0.4927,0.9386,2019-03-03 00:00:00,10,I like these Woody Allen type comedies. I hope they make more. Jennifer Anniston's character was excellent and was so funny.
" Rather different and quite funny comedy
",0.7159,0.9888,2019-01-28 00:00:00,8,"Imogen Poots does a wonderful job as a now famous actress in this rather different and quite funny comedy that uses the infrequent narrator (during an interview with mostly flashbacks as the primary driving force of this movie) device to great effect. The movie consists of a hilarious mishmash of simultaneous encounters in a look back of the rise to fame as an aspiring actress as she seeks to audition for a Broadway play with Wilson Owen starring as the play's director. This riot of plentiful multitude of characters is somehow successfully brought to the screen with some semblance of comprehension with good editing and script writing. With the same charm as the hilarious Broadway play ""Noises Off"" and the less so effective 1992 movie adaptation, this technically difficult movie manages to retain its persistent, consistent charm throughout along with a naturalistic ending that is both edgy yet mature in its depiction."
" Not your average comedy movie
",-0.2755,0.9121,2019-01-26 00:00:00,6,"I decided to watch this movie because Jennifer Aniston and I watched it without knowing the plot or watching the trailer, so i didn't expect it to be a movie about a journey of an upcoming actor which made the movie intriguing and it had a good plot. I liked how the characters were well portrayed and how unique they were in their different ways. There were a few funny moments in the movie, but I think there could have been more and Jennifer Aniston should've have had a bigger role and more screen time because her character was hilarious.Overall the movie was good; not the best comedy movie as the plot could've been a bit better, but i do recommend you watch it if you're a big fan of comedy actors like Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston, Kathryn Hahn etc."
" Charming Peter Bogdanovich throwback to classic screwball comedies
",0.743,0.9626,2018-12-28 00:00:00,8,"Written and directed by Peter Bogdanovich (one of my favorites), this throwback to classic screwball comedies like ""Bringing Up Baby"" or ""It Happened One Night"" tells the story of the opening of a Broadway play by director Owen Wilson and playwright Will Forte. When Wilson crushes on an escort he calls to his hotel room one night, a charming Imogen Poots, she turns out to be an aspiring actress who later nails her audition for the aforementioned play and makes things complicated when Wilson's wife, who's one of the stars of the show (and who's being seduced by her on-stage co-star, Rhys Ifans) wants Poots to be her co-star over Wilson's objections. Things get even more complicated when Forte begins to crush on Poots over his shrewish psychologist girlfriend, Jennifer Aniston (who's also Poots' psychologist). And all that is established pretty much the first 25 minutes of the movie! For fan of classic comedies, ""She's Funny that Way"" is a real treat, but for modern audiences not attuned to the mannered style of old fashioned comedies, I'm not sure how well it would be received. Still, it's a pretty hard to resist cast, which also includes Richard Lewis and Cybill Shepherd as Poots' parents, Debi Mazar as her madam, as well as Tatum O'Neal, Colleen Camp, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Shannon, Joanna Lumley, Austin Pendleton, and Quentin Tarantino as himself. Overall, ""She's Funny That Way"" is not a classic, but it's a treat for film buffs."
" Hilarious!
",0.4574,0.691,2018-12-01 00:00:00,7,"I laughed a lot while watching this movie, and it became one of these movies that I will never get sick of watching them over and over again."
" Sexual Masterpiece for Mature & Intelligent Film Audience
",0.872,0.9618,2018-10-20 00:00:00,9,"Ok, where do i start to keep this short and simple. Not a movie for about 90% of the people i interact with in everyday life and friends and family, this movie appealed only to my uncle who is almost 40yrs older than myself. The very person who inspired me to watching film in the first place, without my uncle i would have no memories of robert mitchum, humphrey bogart, edward g robinson flics from the 1930's to 1950's. Memories of childhood that never escaped my curiousity of the golden age of film or his golden age of film.If your favorite movies or movies you typically watch are from 1990 to the present, the humor that is apparent in every scene will go by unnoticed and the viewer will most likely not understand the underlying game going on between characters when there is dialog and when no dialog is present and just gestures displayed between characters, the one's between seth and albert are hysterical when seth is gesturing little things without saying a word.Its a movie based on sexual connections and i'm surprised that not even 1 major or whatever u call them these days (paid critics), failed to mention that simple observation of the film. Instead just hate and misdirection of details that if you didnt understand or get the 1st time around u won't miss the 2nd time around watching this film.I love it, the characters, the story and the way the whole film overall.I guess your either into film from the past 20yrs or so , or your into searcher deeper into the past before you even entered the world, to learn and experience that what you once thought was original in the not so distant present, was done 30-50yrs before you even entered the world. This is a film for those who truly respect film from an era that is now extinct practically and literally thought to not exist by today's current generation of film lovers."
" A farce to be enjoyed!!!
",0.3561,0.9008,2018-08-04 00:00:00,10,"So few good farces written nowdays, this one is REALLY good. I predict this will be good for years, too. Like you could watch it again even.
Out of a possible ten I give it a twelve and I am going to remember the writers and directors so I can look for more."
" Of all the gin joints...
",0.0,0.4869,2018-01-25 00:00:00,8,"The film centers around Isabella Patterson (Imogen Poots) who believes an embellished story is better than the facts. She is giving an interview to a reporter (Illeana Douglas) about her start in the film industry. Isabella started out as an escort (she prefers muse) who aspired to be an actress. She meets director Arnold (Owen Wilson) who is casting for a play. Arnold gives her $30,000 to stop working in her profession and to do something else. This is a habit of Arnold, which will bite him later. In fact the humor of the film is that everyone loves Isabella and the coincidences of all the relationships turning the fact of discovery in inane scenes. Jennifer Aniston delightfully plays the world's worse therapist. I didn't recognize Cybill Shepherd who had a minor role.A fun quirky film, but not a great comedy.No f-bombs or nudity. Implied sex. Aniston uses male ""C"" word. Some sex talk."
" Amazing Cast for an Old School Comedy
",0.743,0.9917,2018-01-18 00:00:00,6,"There might be nothing original about it, even the title sounds a hundred years old, it´s a nostalgic movie alright but, although it might not be good enough to revitalize the romantic screwball comedy, it oddly feels like a breathe of fresh air among its contemporaries, paradoxically indeed. It does maintain a fast pace throughout, well, at least until right before the climax, and Peter Bogdanovich shows experienced skill, but the so-so script comes really together thanks to its outstanding cast. It´s seriously well put together, every single role is spot-on. It´s ultimately a film about acting and everyone is enjoying the ride in a contagious way. Just when I thought the cast was good enough there´s a cameo by Michael Shannon, and it´s not even the only surprising cameo, let´s leave it at that. The plot centers around Imogen Poots´character, the main reason I watched it in the first place, and I´m very happy about that. Light hearted and funny enough, there should be a big audience able to enjoy it without cynicism."
" some minor laughs
",0.4939,0.8793,2017-09-02 00:00:00,6,"Izzy Finkelstein/Isabella Patterson (Imogen Poots) recounts her story to reporter Judy (Illeana Douglas). It's four years earlier. Family-man director Arnold Albertson (Owen Wilson) arrives at his Manhattan hotel and calls for an escort. Vickie (Debi Mazar) sends Isabella over to the hotel. He gives her $30k to get out of sex work to pursue her acting dreams. Jane Claremont (Jennifer Aniston) is Izzy's callous therapist. Next, Izzy shows up at an audition for Arnold's play.Peter Bogdanovich seems to be going for the Woody Allen vibe. Imogen Poots is trying for the Jersey girl hooker with a heart of gold. I can't get over the Brit pushing her accent work. Mira Sorvino was much better in this role. Aniston is playing an inappropriate therapist which borders between trying too hard and the only consistent wacky laughs. She's doing a different movie. The cast is top notch. Overall, the laughs don't come often enough but is enough to keep things interesting."
" She's funny, but not overly
",0.2382,0.9802,2017-08-17 00:00:00,3,"As an attempt to make a modern screwball comedy this film is to be applauded, but while it has its moments, and a very strong cast, I can't say I ever found it to be as funny or entertaining as it was intended to be.Owen Wilson does his 'Mr nice guy' act that we've seen many, many times before, and Imogen Poots' accent got on my nerves after a while, as did the constant linking device with her being interviewed.It does boast a performance from Jennifer Aniston that's a bit different from what we're used to, and the always welcome sight of Rhys Ifans, but other than that this was quite standard, unexceptional entertainment."
" Clever, a modern classic
",0.4588,0.9964,2017-06-12 00:00:00,7,"For the life of me, I can't figure out why this film was titled She's Funny That Way, but the odd title notwithstanding, this is one funny movie! It isn't funny in a modern way, either; it feels like a 1930s screwball comedy. Gone are the days when movies rely solely on verbal banter, but Peter Bogdanovich has created a classic for today's audiences.The film alternates between the actual story and Imogen Poots's character's interview from after the story's end. I don't happen to think Poots is very pretty look at on the screen, but there's nothing wrong with her acting or her very thick, adorable New York accent. Included in the fast-paced story is a cast of colorful characters including a womanizing playwright, a hooker with a heart of gold, and an incompetent therapist. Set in New York, with quick, clever dialogue, this film reminds me of a Woody Allen movie. Even Poots's over-the-top accent sounds like Allen coached her. So if you like his movies, you'll like this one. If you like classics, you'll like this one. If you like clever humor, well, you'll like this one. It's funny that way, you know?"

WHY WAS I ATTRACTED TO THIS MOVIE? 1.star cast (imogen poots , Owen Wilson ,jennifer aniston) 2.i love comedies.

" So charming and hilarious
",0.7939,0.9879,2017-04-02 00:00:00,9,"I chose She's Funny That Way randomly in a rental store. It seemed like an easy, cute movie to watch. And I can't believe how much I actually love this! She's Funny That Way has that weird yet charming atmosphere mostly created by the music and the dialogue. It's what I'd want from certain director's who are popular but whose films are actually very boring to the common viewer. This film is hilarious because of the chaotic way everything just piles up and how many characters know each other and run into each other during the movie. She's Funny That Way is an excellent and charming comedy, which I warmly recommend to everyone."
" To everyone who doesn't rate it ten, are you Nuts?
",-0.3182,0.8729,2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"What you can expect more from a film, about a theatre play?!? Not just, that everyone is mentioning how it resembles great ideas of Woody, that I was expecting him to pass by in the crowd (and he is definitely somewhere there), not just, that is ""fairytalie"", as it gets (yes, that one, as good), not just that it's good as well remake, or inspiration based as crazy mad Birdman, not just, that the casting is brilliant and very articulate, not just the plot is one galloping horse ride from the very first to the VERY LAST moment, but there is a catch at the very end at last! So to everyone, who is bi...moaning about anything in this OPUS, squirrel you! Peace!Homage á this film"
