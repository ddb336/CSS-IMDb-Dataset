" Cannot fall lower than cutting up women
",0.0997,-0.9672,2021-03-15 00:00:00,1,I was privileged to watch one the worst movies of my life. So now a villain needs to actually cut women into pieces before he calls himself a villain. Degrading disgusting and a complete excrescence of a movie. And the fact it's got 6.5 shows a degeneracy which is appalling
" Liam Neeson is brilliant!
",0.6239,0.4939,2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,Intense. Much better than the current rating - 6.5 reflects.
" We all forget Liam can act
",-0.2263,0.2263,2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"This movie is great for what it is. A murder, true crime redemption arc mystery. Go into it with the expectations to enjoy an hour or two and you won't be let down."
" A decent story of a true PI
",0.4215,0.5856,2020-12-23 00:00:00,6,"Liam Neeson in a dark PI story is entertaining to watch. The voiceover that sometimes pops up is great and adds to the suspense and apparent loneliness of Neeson. For me, the movie misses some elements that pull the viewer into the story. A lack of emotion maybe? But the story is well laid out, the sidekick fits and the rest of the cast play their roles in a more than decent manner. Not the best movie that Neeson chose, but certainly a watch worthwile."
" Race against time
",0.0,-0.34,2020-11-01 00:00:00,6,"In 1991 Detective Matthew Scudder leaves the police department after a shooting goes wrong. Eight years later, working as a Private Investigstor, he is hired by a drug trafficker to find out who kidnapped and killed his wife. The case is more complex than first thought.Decent action film starring Liam Neeson therefore you know what to expect. As usual it's a strong performance and some interesting characters with a turn of events as the film reaches its conclusion. Co-stars Dan Stevens."
" Neeson Looks Cool In A Goatee And Long Hair, But The Movie Is Barely Passable As Entertainment
",0.6065,-0.4572,2020-10-26 00:00:00,4,"I considered giving it a 5/10, but I normally reserve 5s for films that are not great but are passable as entertainment. So I gave it 4 because their are some elements of the story that are contrived or plain awful. The best thing about it was seeing Neeson in a goatee and long hair. Too bad he didn't have them the entire movie."

" A worthy watch

A simple well paced story executed and acted well."
" A good Lawrence Block adaptation
",0.0,-0.6212,2020-06-04 00:00:00,8,Not like the '99 millions way to die' but it was a decent thriller. Especially I like that there is not so much music in the film.
" Basic detective yarn told well...
",0.0,-0.9455,2020-05-13 00:00:00,6,"This had the advantage of the, sparing, participation of Dan Stevens; so was always going to be worth watching - and it actually is. A dodgy drug dealer (DS) calls in retired cop Liam Neeson when his wife is kidnapped and then brutally murdered. Initially, Neeson declines to get involved, but when he discovers just quite how she was killed he sets off to track down the culprits. In a bit of a parallel storyline, we have some idea as to who the criminals are and that they are also continuing to target similar targets - it's a race against time now. Neeson, and his new, streetwise young pal ""TJ"" (Astro) gel well and as the investigation gathers pace this becomes quite a suspenseful pyscho-thriller. It rather hits the skids with fifteen minutes, or so, to go though - the ending left me puzzled and disappointed in pretty much equal measure."
" Shades of ""Taken""
",0.0,-0.2057,2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,"What is it with Liam Neeson and kidnap dramas? Although I have to say this is more substance, less blatant action for its own sake, and his character is more relatable, flawed and real. And more noble since his motives are altruistic rather than on a personal case of vengeance and he is a haunted character seeking redemption. This makes it a cut above the Taken series and by far more interesting. There is a running spiritual element to this, mentioned in the 12 Steps and in the names of the victims which are all allusions of God, man and Christ. This helps take it beyond what would otherwise be an excuse to brutalize women. It is noticeably lacking a strong female presence, which I understand was cut (mistakenly IMHO) from the final by eliminating a major character. Dan Stevens' complicated character of a mourning drug-dealer and Brian ""Astro"" Bradley as the precocious TJ serve to add depth and dimension to this film."
" This is not taken
",0.0,0.9761,2020-04-21 00:00:00,7,Randomly put this on with the wife on netlfix.. Wasn't expecting much but it turns out to be an atmospheric good little thriller. Liam Nelson is believable and isn't the indestructible hard man he is in the taken trilogy... He also be friends a young chap 2ho does very well in his role.. Overall a good watch very easy and enjoyable
" Grim, bleak but rather good.
",0.3612,0.5041,2020-02-10 00:00:00,8,"This was a suitably gloomy, outing for Liam Neeson but in places it's an intense and rather exciting thriller. He plays a 'Private Dick' (an ex cop), who has a typical black past and is now helping anyone who can afford his services. Still retaining a type of code of honour, he gets assigned to a case of two very nasty individuals, who are kidnapping young women and sexually assaulting them, before cutting them into pieces. It's a better film than 'Taken' so deserves some attention and a much higher rating."
" Liam Neeson Wasted On This Film
",-0.4939,-0.6647,2020-01-24 00:00:00,4,"The movie was very slow, boring and predictable. I love Liam Neeson's acting and he usually kicks butt severely; but his talents were greatly wasted as the show dragged on with the dreary part he was given to act. The story was full of cliché's and it took forever to get anywhere. It felt like they ran out of genuine idea's for this movie and just put in random boring scenes to fill the time."
" Could be Special
",0.4019,0.925,2019-11-14 00:00:00,7,"Sadly this one didn't hit the mark all the way through. It does have some very strong points to it at times though. I was hoping it would turn into more of a darker thriller but it didn't.
Liam was as usual and good. The play off between him and his sidekick was good."
" A Walk Among the Tombstones
",0.0,-0.9985,2019-08-18 00:00:00,3,"I heard the title of this film a few times while it was playing in cinemas, I missed it, then I missed it a number of times when it kept showing on TV for a couple of years, I decided to rent it and see if I was missing out on anything good, or bad. Basically, in New York City, Matthew ""Matt"" Scudder (Liam Neeson) is a former police detective with a chequered, alcoholic past. He is now retired and works as an unlicensed private investigator operating just outside the law. Matt is approached by drug addict Peter Kristo (Boyd Holbrook), and asks him to help his brother Kenny (Dan Stevens). Kenny is a drug trafficker whose wife was kidnapped and murdered. He tells Matt that after he delivered the ransom, the kidnappers directed him to a car containing his wife's dismembered body. Matt ultimately agrees to find the kidnappers. At the library, Matt researches similar killings, and meets a homeless youth named TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley), who helps with his search. Matt goes to a cemetery and speaks with the groundskeeper, Jonas Loogan (Olafur Darri Olafsson), who found bags containing parts of the dismembered Leila in the cemetery pond. Matt talks to Leila's fiancé Reuben Quintana (Mark Consuelos), who claims to have witnessed the kidnapping. Matt meets with Jonas again, at the top of an apartment building with a tool shed, it contains photos of Reuben and Leila having sex. Jonas admits that he helped kidnap Leila. He was working with Reuben to help her stop using drugs but had no idea that the two kidnappers would torture and kill Leila. Jonas gives Matt the name of one of the two men, Ray, and jumps off the roof to his death. The two kidnappers, Ray (David Harbour) and Albert (Adam David Thompson), are preparing to target another victim. They were originally going to take the wife of Yuri Landau (Sebastian Roché), another drug trafficker. But realise she is bedridden, so they instead kidnap his 14-year-old daughter Lucia (Danielle Rose Russell). While Matt finds connections with the victims and the DEA, he grows closer to TJ, and encourages him to study and avoid a life of crime. He tells TJ why he retired from the police, it was eight years ago in 1991, during a shootout, that a stray bullet Matt fired at an assailant accidentally hit and killed a 7-year-old girl, he has been sober ever since. Kenny brings Matt to Landau's home, where the kidnappers call and arrange a drop. Matt knows that the kidnappers intend to kill the girl after the ransom is paid, so he does what he can to make sure this will not happen, bargaining with them during the call. The drop takes place at the cemetery, after a stand-off, Lucia is returned to his father. When Albert realises the ransom money is counterfeit, a shootout ensues. Peter is killed, and Matt wounds Ray. Albert and Ray escape in their van, but with TJ sneaked in the back. After Albert and Ray arrive at their place, TJ sneaks out of their van, calls Matt, and tells him the address. Albert garrottes the wounded Ray in the basement, and goes back upstairs to find Matt, Kenny, and TJ. Albert is overpowered and cuffed by Matt. Matt calls a cab for TJ, Albert frees himself, and when Matt goes back inside, he finds Kenny dead. Albert attacks Matt, and after a brief fight, Matt kills him. Matt returns home to find TJ sleeping on the couch and a drawing that TJ made of himself as a superhero, he sits down and falls asleep. Also starring Laura Birn as Leila Andresen and Marielle Heller as Marie Gotteskind. Neeson does his usual craggy hero thing, less well than perhaps Taken and other films, Stevens is shifty, and Astro is okay, there is nothing really original, a former cop investigates a kidnapping and murder, finds out about other cases, and goes against the criminals, it has daft dialogue, and only some violence and action picks it up a little, it is just a very average crime thriller. Adequate!"
" Engaging Thriller with a Star but Optional
",0.2263,0.9245,2019-07-20 00:00:00,6,"Liam Neeson's fans this way please! Probably the best thing about the movie is how well Liam Neeson fits the main character which is a retired cop turned private detective with a tormented past. It's always a treat to watch his intense looks and heroics. The rest of the film is your usual crime story line with no major plot changing twists. Nonetheless, it as an entertaining thriller with some disturbing scenes and a charming performance from the cast."
" Basic but watchable
",0.0,-0.0449,2019-07-05 00:00:00,4,It's got enough of a story to keep you leaving it on but not enough to keep your attention. Very basic story nothing compelling or award winning.
" my notes

" Poor movie
",-0.4767,-0.6361,2019-05-18 00:00:00,4,"A very poor script, cliched roles, stilted acting, appalling gratuitous violence. Liam Neeson is a much better actor than this. He ought to know better."
" Boring is an understatement
",-0.3182,-0.9487,2019-05-18 00:00:00,1,"I was bored out of my mind. I'm shocked I made it to the end, waiting for something to happen but nothing did. Characters you don't care about, a storyline that's hard to follow and and harder to care about. It's just so boring I'm shocked this made it to theatres."
" Dark and intense: Not for the faint-hearted!
",0.1511,0.6998,2019-04-21 00:00:00,10,"This is a very dark and brutal film. Definitely not meant for kids and even faint-hearted adults.A Walk Among the Tombstones is not just another Liam Neeson film. Its tone and background score are enough to confirm that. Neeson plays a tough detective, and undoubtedly delivers with brilliance. The cast is full of strong performers, due to which the level of intensity feels much, much higher.The story might not be the first of its kind, but it's the screenplay and execution that hits the target. One could call it an exploitative film due to its mature nature but then it's an adaptation of a novel of the same name, and while I haven't read it, I feel it's possibly a brutal and honest adaptation.And while it's slower and more dramatic as compared to Neeson's most action films, Tombstones makes up for most of it in the form of well choreographed action scenes it delivers at the right time and in the right amount. In short, it's a strongly written, tension filled neo-noir action thriller that deserves to be seen, if you aren't easily disturbed or turned off by the frequently graphic violence and language."
" One of the rare serious movies Liam Neeson made recently. It's nice to see more true to life acting, but the pace is a bit boring and the story is downbeat. Worth 1 watch.
",0.2952,0.8913,2019-04-02 00:00:00,6,"This is one of the rare Liam Neeson movies that are meant to be taken seriously. It is about an ex cop who is investigating the kidnapping of wife and children of some gangster boss. Will he be able to rescue them or will he die trying?Simple story, yet this time around, there is NOT much action to be enjoyed. It is more of a slowburning detective story, with lots of investigations going on. Not nearly as flashy and exhilirating as all the other Liam Neeson action pictures. Come to think of it, this is NOT an action picture firstmost. Yes, there is some good action, yet it is rather grim and without the usual fun factor.The whole mood of this picture is somewhat downbeat. The storyline is cause of that, because it was based on a (downbeat) novel. For some reason they decided that Liam Neeson had to take care of a streetkid, while searching for the kidnappers. He is also batttling alcoholism during this story.These story sidelines are all being portrayed seriously and it's done reasonably convincing, yet somehow I got a bit down and bored sometimes watching it. It isnt a full blown drama either, so I just kept feeling that these more dramatic emotional side storylines about alcoholism and taking care of a streetkid were distracting from the suspense and pace of the action part of the movie.Worth only 1 watch, because I didnt like the downbeat mood of it. Liam Neeson though, is still being the typical Liam Neeson as we know him of all the other action movies, so watching him is still quite enjoyable!"
" Excellent Suspense/Thriller Movie

" Sick and lame
",-0.7269,0.4779,2019-01-19 00:00:00,3,"I liked the beginning of this movie and don't mind the TV noir like and unlike taken style. However, how some of the evilness portrayed is too much and not necessary. Also, the relationship between the main character and his little friend is somewhat artificially constructed."
" Detective Crime Drama
",-0.5423,0.7717,2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Don't come into this movie expecting a typical action movie. This is a slow burning crime drama that revolves around a good script and great acting. This was my first taste of David Harbour and I could tell he had a future in Hollywood.I'm the minority, but I enjoyed this more than Taken."
" IT WASN'T AS MUCH FUN AFTER THAT
",-0.4023,-0.9825,2018-12-20 00:00:00,5,"The film opens up with Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson) doing a watered down version of a ""Dirty Harry"" scene. Eight years later in 1999, Matt is no longer a cop, but a private detective and is eight years sober. He is contacted by a man about a case as we soon discover a couple of guys are kidnapping the wives of rich drug traffickers, demanding ransom, and then killing their victims anyway.Matt is aided by some unlikely characters and follows his 12 step program, which we painfully get to hear, as he goes after the bad guys.This is an okay me-too ""Dirty Harry"" film, but nothing that great. The characters were not entertaining. The dialogue was bland, especially for us who have had the misfortune to never participate in a 12 step program. What the heck was that all about?"
" I loved it
",0.5994,0.7897,2018-10-22 00:00:00,10,"I just watched this film for the first time lastnight, and I really enjoyed it ! I might actually watch it again tonight with my aunt who hasn't seen it. If you like Crime / Mystery movies this is a great one to watch."
" A Walk in New York City
",0.0,-0.9974,2018-10-16 00:00:00,5,"Liam Neeson is an old dog that loves to fetch the same old. At this point, I could care less what's next for him because this picture was an excuse just for him to be another drunken wreck who's trying to redeem himself something stupid he has done. I could have sworn I saw this last spring with ""Non-Stop."" ""Taken 3"" is his next film, that should say it all. The last two weren't great so what makes him think we need a third installment? Anyway, ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is based on a book by Lawrence Block.It's about a retired cop, Matthew Scudder (Liam Neeson), who had an accident on the job and is now an unlicensed private detective working in New York City. When a drug kingpin asks him for his help to find two men who have murdered his wife, Matthew accepts the offer and begins investigating. What he uncovers is a murder mystery that will take him from one end of New York to the other.Liam Neeson is starting to lose himself in these tough-guy roles. We have seen this before in ""Taken"" and ""Taken 2"". He's not a bad actor, he just plays the same characters with a different name and its tiring. He gives an okay performance in this picture as a burnt out alcoholic with a sad past, but these alcoholic roles are starting to become a drag. Ex-police, ex-DEA, and ex-Military, they all seem to be burnt-out drunks after their service, and it's getting stale for these kinds of pictures. Liam is not the only actor that plays these roles, but he is the one who shows up the most with them.Neeson is the least of the problems this picture faces. Several scenes make no sense and give no explanation. There is a sequence where a guy walks merely off a roof in the middle of a conversation, for no apparent reason. There is a sequence near the end where someone is given a choice, Why? And then a character leaves, but for some unknown reason, he returns. It's almost like only this character could finish the movie so why have him go and return? Here's the most stupid thing, the killers are two morons who steal wives and daughters from wealthy drug dealers because they have money to pay. They're two ex-DEA agents who, for some reason, are insane and we never learn why.The movie opens, and we see Matthew Scudder is having a dreadful day and sitting in a bar in 1991. After a brutal firefight, the film moves to its present day in 1999 where Scudder is apparently sober. He is a private dick and called to accept a case from a wealthy drug dealer. Matthew agrees with the offer, and from here the film falls apart. Things flare up when body parts appear in bags in the back of a trunk and Matthew is pulled into the case. It kind of feels like one super long episode of Televisions ""Law & Order."" It's grim and dark throughout, but it's not difficult to figure the movie out in the first half hour. By the second act, we know how it's going to end.None of the characters of the picture make sense. There is a sequence in the second act where Matthew is talking to a suspect, and for some unexplained reason, he walks off the roof of the building in the middle of a speech. Is he scared of someone? It almost feels like something supernatural is happening here but this picture is just a crime thriller. We never learn anything about this, and it acts like this character never existed after we see his body. Another aspect is a punk kid, TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who apparently becomes Matthew's assistance. They meet in a library and after a short conversation is working together on a murder investigation.You can figure out how it ends. The ending is stupidly put together and messy, and It makes no sense when Matthew figures out where the sickos are and he arrives at a house where they have been hiding in a basement. He walks into the basement then walks out of the house. After everyone has been attacked, Matt shows up guns blazing. Why did he leave? You can figure out which character it is, and you can figure out how it ends. This could've been a much better picture because it is a crime thriller. It's not so much Liam that is the problem, it's the structure and screenplay to the movie are botched, and it comes off as a complete mess."
" Violence definitely begets violence to the point of nonsense
",-0.8481,-0.9571,2018-08-26 00:00:00,6,"Liam Neeson has mastered this type of role where he quietly dishes out some sound beatings and shoots to kill. In this case, he is a former cop who comes to the rescue of a drug baron whose wife was raped, killed and cut to pieces, after he had paid ransom. Why the abductors bothered to leave the drug baron alive is baffling but perhaps they thought they would never be tracked down.So Neeson goes to great lengths to find the murdering thieves and somehow - not very credibly, including info from a source who commits completely pointless suicide - tracks them down, with the help of a ultra bright African American kid, and of the revenge-seeking drug baron.According to the old adage, revenge is best served as a cold dish, but here it is served with heavy shooting and gore, and the baddies survive even after looking deader than door nails. Toward the end, Neeson suggests to the drug baron that he not kill the main evil doer but turn him over to justice, but then he does it himself.Moral lesson? I don't know that there is one,. Action sequences aplenty and generally well done. Neeson's performance is reliable, as ever in this type of role. Photography is good and screenplay just gets by in terms of believability, despite a fair number of holes.Worst sin: far too long. 30 min less , and less gore, might have made it a good movie."
" a fresh take on the clished drug based crime thriller

Review: I really enjoyed this movie for two reasons. Reason number one because it is a fresh take on the classic genre of neo-noir crime thriller. Reason number two because at the heart of the story its about friendship. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. Both the casting and acting are incredible also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars."
" Elegantly crafted
",0.4404,-0.978,2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Movie Review: A Walk Among the TombstonesA Walk Among the Tombstones is a film released on September 19, 2014, written and directed by Scott Frank, based on the 1992 novel of the same name by Lawrence Block. It stars Liam Neeson, Dan Stevens, David Harbour, Brian Bradley, and Boyd Holbrook. 
The movie takes off with the protagonist, Detective Matthew ""Matt"" Scudder in a car, with a partner, who expresses his dissatisfaction with Matthew as a reliable back-up. Later, the detective goes into a bar; while he is there, there, two armed men come in and kill the bartender. Pursuing them, the detective kills all three people, including their getaway driver. Why, as a result of this shootout, Matthew retires from active service is what we come to know later in the movie. Much, much later.
Matthew becomes an active member of an Alcoholics Anonymous group.
Eight years later, a drug addict approaches Matthew and asks him to help his brother, a drug trafiicker whose wife has been kidnapped. Though the husband had rustled up and delivered the ransom money, it was the wife's tortured, brutalised, dis membered body which had been delivered to the husband. Trying to discover a lead or clue, Matthew frequents the library to discover similar crimes. He befriends a savvy, brutally frank, homeless teenager, TJ, in the library. Matthew speaks to people and comes across a groundsman in the graveyard, among the tombstones, close to where another dismembered body, packed in separate plastic bags was found floating in the pond. 
Alone and without help, Matthew shoulders on, digging, digging, digging. And the killers are at large, hunting for their next prey. The scene cuts to the house of the killers from time to time, panning to their terrifying instruments of torture, with sharp, barbaric knives and gouges to cut up bits of living flesh while the victim screamed in agony. Another 14-year old girl is kidnapped; she is the daughter of another trafficker, and suddenly, Mattthew is in the centre of the action...
No, I am not going to be a spoiler here, or reveal the twists and turns of the plot. There are so many unexpected events happening that it is difficult to predict what will happen next.
Watch the movie for Liam Neeson's understated histrionics: how he makes do with one raised eyebrow to convey an entire page of script. He is shown to be human and vulnerable, morose and non-committal: TJ, the homeless teenager is a wonderful foil to his character. Bright, cynical, worldly wise, the would-be detective sails through the movie, putting down his angst and his talent down on pieces of paper, in the form of animation figures.
The climax, where there is a faceoff between the suave, slick killers and the bumbling team consisting of the father of the kidnapped girl, the husband of the murdered woman, the drug addict and Liam Neeson, among the tombstones in the same graveyard, is masterly. The voice over is of a woman reciting the 12 steps of recovery of a confirmed alcoholic: 
1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.
2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.
4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
5. Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.
9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.
As these steps are recited in the voice-over, there is a parallel piece of action happening: and I found this analogy particularly moving. The haunting tracks of 'Black Hole Sun' featuring Nouela, that accompanies the rolling credits at the end, sounded like an extension of the neo noir genre that the movie is slotted into.
The movie concludes with a resolution, a firm friendship and trust between two strangers: TJ and Matthew, and a vindication of the resilience of the human spirit despite all odds.
Go, watch A Walk Among the Tombstones."
" Passable Crime Thriller
",-0.4767,0.6808,2018-06-01 00:00:00,6,'A Walk Among the Tombstones' is little bit more than usual Liam Neeson action flick. Bleak and gritty psychological thriller which roots definitely lie in the neo-noir genre and it also stands somewhat as an homage to hard boiled detective stories (Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe are referenced several times and the screenplay is based on the novel of the same name by author Lawrence Block). Although the film barely manages to float over the usual genre clichés it fails to offer anything new and by the end it is still a standard fare that is pretty forgettable. Liam Neeson's dedicated performance felt even too much of a waste for such a film.
" Wow... This movie deserves a 9*

" Tailor-Made For Liam Neeson
",0.0,0.2823,2018-03-10 00:00:00,8,"""A Walk Among The Tombstones"" Is The Perfect Vehicle For Liam Neeson. He plays Matt Scudder - an ex-cop haunted by a troubled and alcoholic past who makes ends meet by working as an unlicensed private detective. He gets hired by a wealthy drug dealer to find the scum who kidnapped, raped, tortured and murdered his wife, and as he investigates he discovers that she isn't the only one who's fallen victim to the killers - they've been targeting the wives, girlfriends and daughters of wealthy drug dealers - and in the end the movie focuses on the desperate search for a 14-year old girl who's been taken by them.This movie is dark and suspenseful, and Scudder is a dark, troubled and gritty character. From the very beginning the viewer is drawn in because after only a few minutes we become aware of what's happening to these young women with creepy shots of one of the terrified victims being bound and touched by her captors. It's enough to make you feel sympathy for the victims. You want these guys to be caught. You want justice and/or revenge for what they've done. The movie plays on that. It avoids the temptation to become overly graphic with what's happened to the victims. Just a few shots every now and then make things clear. There's a tense and sombre feel to this from the very beginning and that mood never really goes away.Neeson was superb. This character fit him to a ""t."" I was basically unfamiliar with the rest of the cast. They all did well enough. But they're not what I would consider big name actors. This was Neeson's movie. He would be the draw - his presence in the cast was why I chose to watch this - and he does not disappoint.There were a couple of things here that didn't work especially well for me. I wasn't entirely clear on how Scudder made the connection between the various killings as quickly as he did, and the character of T.J. - a homeless boy who befriends Scudder and becomes his sort-of partner - seemed extraneous to me. The movie could have worked perfectly well without him and I never really understood the point of his presence. But those are relatively minor quibbles. This is a very good movie with a story and performance from Neeson that are first-rate. (8/10)"
" Horrible just horrible.
",-0.7906,-0.7374,2018-02-26 00:00:00,1,"How many more of these is L.N. going to make. Boring acting, no heart in it at all. Going through the motions to get a paycheck. Stupid ending, not realistic in anyway. Weak action scenes, no suspense. What tombstones are they walking through. One scene in a graveyard, even if it's used metaphorically. Very much of a waste of time. The premise is absolutely ridiculous so far fetched it's like we have no minds. Thanks but no thanks. Please Liam no more, just put some effort into a real movie that forces you to actually act."
" Pedestrian
",0.0,-0.7983,2018-01-01 00:00:00,5,"Liam Neeson does a decent job as the moody retired detective Matthew Scudder who finds himself on the trail of the brutal murderers of the wife of a drug kingpin.It's a reasonably gripping movie. There's regular tension as Scudder puts himself at risk in graveyards, strange buildings, basements etc. The supporting cast all do a good job.But it's nothing special. The plot is boringly predictable. The identity of the murderers is revealed to the viewer early on (and Scudder figures it out himself not much later) and from then on it's a fairly pedestrian chase and fight between them and Scudder.There's also a strange lack of any major female characters. It's one of those movies where women are only represented as victims.An ok watch but not really one I'd recommend."
" A Walk Among the Tombstones (2014) - Mister Movie
",0.0,-0.803,2017-09-13 00:00:00,7,"At this point Liam Neeson had cemented himself as our new action hero superstar who proved that beating the air out of bad guys never gets old, if you do it right of course.'A Walk Among the Tombstones' takes our beloved actor down a different path this time with the character of Scudder (Neeson), an ex-cop who clearly has the weight of the past bearing down on him. Working now as a private investigator, Scudder accepts his latest case that gets him involved with some bad people, and some really bad people. From there, you tag along with him as he tries to identify the people who are responsible for the murder of his employer's wife.This might sound like something you have seen before because it is and it isn't. While the movie feels like previous pictures, it still manages to do the same things differently.The film manages to keep you attached with well acted characters, a steady story, that sometimes derails in different directions but quickly collects itself and progresses with the central story, and some really deranged villains that sometimes make you question humanity or the lack of, in this case.To end this review, the film is entertaining with some slow moments here and there, though they are usually integral to the characters or the story itself.Rating: Medium WellMister Movie"
" Captures Much Of The Darkness of Scudder
",-0.25,0.9897,2017-06-28 00:00:00,6,"The debut novel in Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder series is arguably the darkest and most unrelentingly bleak of the countless private eye novels I've read, and although I haven't read the novel which this film is an adaptation of, I suspect director Franks has nailed its tone.The subject matter - of the executions by a pair of renegade ex-DEA agents of drug kingpin wives and, in the final case, child - and the graphic nature of the killings might suggest cheap thrills appealing to fans of such as 'Death Wish' and other vigilante-style films, but there's a dark intelligence here, even if the focus might suggest otherwise.Based on the Block novels I have read, it's fair to say that they vary wildly in quality - I would also say that his ex-crime-writing buddy, Donald E. Westlake has a higher strike-rate - but this is one instance where I would urge anybody who has recognised the intelligence at work to seek out the source novel, because I strongly suspect that considerable extra depth and value will be added by Scudder's interior monologues.I won't claim to be a huge Liam Neeson fan but although from my vague recall I suspect the Scudder of the novels is bulkier and more beaten down - perhaps Brian Dennehy at his peak might have been a better fit - Neeson is probably as good a fit as anybody now, given commercial dictates, and he does an adequate job here.I particularly liked the scenes with the park attendant, and the performance and look of the more talkative psycho, Ray. The drug 'trafficker' who hired Scudder had just enough believable 'humanity' about him to make him seem real, and a cut above the stereotype. Dan Stevens' performance was probably as good as anybody's, in the role. I liked the dark look of daytime New York, too: that's how I would have pictured it in 'Sins Of The Fathers', also. The young sometime-assistant was novel, I suppose, but I could have done without his lightness and frequently-tedious street, and classic PI-smarts. Perhaps this was another concession to commerce?I've read elsewhere that this ending fell considerably short of the novel's, which is a particular highlight. Which is a matter of some relief, also, as this ending - apart from the juxtaposed attendant AA recitation - looked just too familiar for me.6 might be too low, but 7 certainly too high. It's functionally done, but just too lean in its 'execution' to be even considered for ranking among the great crime films of the 21st Century. Perhaps a 6.5, or a 6.4 would be fairest rating, mainly for Lawrence Block and his creation."
