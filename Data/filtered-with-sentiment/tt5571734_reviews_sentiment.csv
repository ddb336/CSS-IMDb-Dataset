",0.6369,0.9604,2021-03-04 00:00:00,10,"Amitabh Bachan did an outstanding and excellent job in his role. I can watch and listen to his speeches in the courtroom scene repeatedly, but the richness of his voice portraying as a lawyer remains stunning. I could say that the court scene is the best of all time."

" Raised a critical societal issue but terribly executed!
",-0.7809,-0.9143,2020-12-14 00:00:00,4,"A woman's privacy, space and consent must be respected! And men in the Eastern societies must understand this! To the extent that this issue was raised in this film and it educated the masses, this film was important. But the whole story, plot and screenplay was unnecessarily confusing, inconsistent, overly dramatic a lot of times and overall just very disappointing!I'm still not sure if they actually asked for money or not. Nevertheless, as soon as Falak admitted that in the court, it becomes a completely different case and the final verdict doesn't make sense. Had Falak not admitted that in the court, the verdict would have made sense, because all the evidence presented by the prosecution was circumstantial and through the eyes of men in our society that are quick to judge a woman's character. So no actual proof that the girls were indeed soliciting, until ofc Falak admitted as much herself.All the ""Safety Manual"" ""arguments"" were overdramatic and pointless in the court room. To the extent it was important to educate the masses, maybe a screenplay with a background narration would have served the purpose better, instead of utterly disrespecting the courtroom proceedings. Not acceptable for an art movie. If it were a TV serial, then anything goes ofc! Mr. Senghal, aka Bachan, did a pathetic job as a lawyer! The whole character, that was supposed to be the educator in the movie, was lame, timid and uncharismatic! Just defeats the purpose.With better writing and direction, could have been an excellent movie. It nevertheless achieved great acclaim, probably because of the critical issue it raised. But my criticism is technical and logical, and it miserably failed in that domain in my view."
" Why Men over Women?
",0.0,0.8689,2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"It's clearly showed in the movie that we have to take care of our boys because when they're in control, a lot of problems could be removed. But it doesn't mean we've to make girls free like our boys are now."

Amitabh bhachan has just played such a beautiful role that its amazing to see! definitely recommend watching this movie at least once in your life!"
" Finally a film challenging the stereotype. No means No.
",-0.6249,0.9901,2020-09-08 00:00:00,8,"Pink review :Welcome to Delhi...the supposed rape capital of the world. This infamous city forms the backdrop of Shoojit Sircar produced and Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury directed Pink in which three independent working women (Tapsee, Kirti and Andrea) get in to trouble with an influencial dude (Angad Bedi).To think of it, this could've happened in any big bad city of this country where the ladies accept a dinner invitation from a politician's scion and his cronies, land up in a resort and one of them ends up banging an alcohol bottle on his face after he tries to molest her. It doesn't matter why they went there with those bozos or whether it was indeed a case of soliciting gone awry. The point is the ladies have a choice and the right to say NO.Seldom has a bollywood film challenged not just the stereotype but our inherent feudal mindset that a partying and drinking woman is easily available to bed....NO if she says so, argues Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Bachchan), the self appointed lawyer defending the three ladies.Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury chooses a sensitive subject, weaves a gripping courtroom drama around it and employs the powerhouse of talent to drive home the point in his trade mark baritone voice. Yes doston, Amitabh Bachchan, at the age of 73, delivers a performance extraordinary enough for him to sweep all the awards in the 'Best Actor' category next year. Well, atleast those which are not rigged. :)All the three girls are terrific performers but Tapsee Pannu is a standout. Angad Bedi impresses in one scene he gets with Bachchan. Piyush Mishra is aptly cast as the prosecution lawyer.On the flipside, there are a few loopholes in form of character continuity of Deepak Sehgal - His bipolar disorder makes him difficult to even speak initially but that doesn't happen when the court proceedings hotten in the second half (?). Also, the parents or families of the three girls hardly support them in their time of crisis...On the tech front, the production quality, editing as well as the background score are top class. The dialogues pack in a solid punch. Thankfully, even the courtroom scenes aren't ridiculously juvenile and unreal as in the recently released 'Rustom'.Even with its share of flaws, Pink is still a superior product coming from bollywood which will be discussed and debated for sure!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."

I bet you during the filming none of the actor/actress felt for a moment that they are acting. All of the performance in this film is beyond realistic. It single handed slummed entire mainstreaming of characterization of women in society. Amitav Sir has delivered something out of the world. the actress's performance will pierce through your heart.

" a thrilling and important story
",0.5994,0.5902,2020-07-20 00:00:00,10,"This story is a long overdue indictment of the way we assess character according to stereotypes, and do grievous harm to people on that basis. This is a great courtroom drama, among the classics like To Kill a Mockingbird and The Caine Mutiny. The screenplay touches on the entire broad sweep of prejudices by which women, especially, are mis-characterized and, with that as justification, abused. That India remains a class society is also dealt with here. It is a modest courtroom in which this great issue of our time - of all time, actually, but in focus now - unfolds. This is not a Bollywood extravaganza, delightful as those are. It is an intimate story of several people we quickly come to like and root for, and others whose hurtful ignorance we pity, for our own sake as much as theirs. The only challenge here is that the likely outcome is signaled by the presence and outstanding performance of Bachchan, one of the pre-eminent actors of our time. We sense early that he has the truth on his side, and that he and his demure, compassionate clients might not walk with the angels, but they live in the neighborhood. The director does a marvelous job of keeping us in suspense just the same, however. To some degree this is a big-city India story: In today's India, including the very week this review is written, certain cases of abuse of women have have gained national attention and outrage. Otherwise, though, it is universal story and a thoroughly enjoyable one. -David Olive, Toronto"

" Must watch!!
",0.0,0.9899,2020-06-18 00:00:00,10,"It is rarely that you watch a movie and it stays with you forever. For me it was the message behind the movie which made it such a remarkable piece of art. Yes, acting, casting, direction, background score was prefect. But the plot is what makes this movie so remarkable, at the end it leaves you anxious and delighted at the same time. Delighted that the truth and what is right prevailed and anxious that such thinking still exists in our society. Taapsee, Kirti, Andrea, Angad, Piyush and everyone else did a remarkable job bringing the characters to life.The movie itself sends a much needed message that how important it is to not 'teach' our daughters to always be on guard but rather teach the boys to respect the opinion of and value women. It highlights the hypocrisy of our society, as to how the same set of behaviour is demonised in girls but ignored as 'natural' in boys. Drinking, going to parties, having guy friends, being polite does not mean you are interested in sex. Society seems to have no problem with men doing the same things but suddenly everybody starts questioning morality of these acts when a woman does it. A tight slap on hypocrisy is what this movie is.
Would recommend this movie to everybody!"

" Thought provoking
",-0.2023,0.9698,2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"Pink is one of those rare movies that is far removed from flashy item songs, out the world romantic storylines & misplaced fight sequences. It is one of those rare gems that give emphasis on real issues that exists in our society like societal mindset towards women ,women safety & corruption.
It is easy to see that the director (Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury) & his team have given more emphasis on acting ,dialogue & storyline & keeping thing real rather than creating a fantasy. As is evidenced by its star cast which includes less known faces except Amitabh , who according to me is steals the show with his gas mask & an unnerving performance.
Each & every character is well crafted with special mention to Taapsse Pannu & kirti Kulhari
The movie is loaded with some strong scenes supported with some impeccable dialogues that will unnerve you to the core & force you to think about the society & system we live in. It Shows how men & women treated different in the society. The movies also touches on the sensitive issue of a woman's right to say 'no' to being touched, regardless of whether the woman is sex worker or wife or friend, the no man has the right to force himself on her.
Altogether the movies is a treat to watch for serious movie lovers."

" Feminism at its best
",0.6369,0.925,2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,"Just seen PINK the movie and I would like admit that nothing has moved me so much as this movie did. Superb Acting by Tapsee Pannu She is probably the best we got in bollywood, Amitabh Bacchan did a very intense and powerful character and uplifted the role in his own charisma, His acting skills shows the reason why he is the biggest bollywood star ever. Director precisely enlights the deep rooted problems and harassments faced by women specially in metros and the immaturity of the society who blindly judge a woman's character by the way she dresses, talk or work. We badly needs these kind of movies to awake the generic thoughts of people who thinks that they can Objectify women and Misuse the power against them. I recommend all of you to watch this great movie. It's a Thought Provoking and a giant leap in movies what we usually watch in bollywood."
" Okay Film, Not The Masterpiece People Are Claiming It Is.
",-0.3387,-0.867,2020-04-09 00:00:00,6,"In essence, ""Pink"" is nothing more than a two-hour Lifetime flick about attempted rape and its ugly aftermath. Has this story ever been told before? At least a thousand times. There was nothing really original to see here. In fact, had the acting of a few people not been average, I would've said ""Pink"" was deserving of a ""7"" rating. The courtroom drama just seemed way too far fetched to be believed. If the court system of modern day Delhi really was that trifling, then I'm surprised any cases are tried. No jury? Well, if that's how it is, I guess that's their way. Only see this if you need to add yet another courtroom drama to your list of courtroom dramas."

It is a movie that every boy and man needs to see and understand.

" Above Average Movie with spectacular performance from Amitabh Bachchan.
",0.0,0.8666,2019-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Story revolves around a molestation case which leads to a court face-off. As the movie is already quite old at the time of writing this review, I'm skipping summarizing the story and would like to directly explain why I chose to give this movie a 7 and not a relatively higher score as others.
I found the court/judge to be biased towards the girls, many people might have ignored this because we as an audience had a idea of what happened but we have to keep in mind the court didn't know anything. I felt like the movie wanted to give a positive message which it successfully did but at the cost of some fallacies in the script. The defense never proved that the 'guilty' Rajveer actually molest Minal Arora and gave hima sentence. Also, Falak Ali admitted to having accepted money from the suspects which should mean that everything the girls reported in their statements could not be taken seriously as this was a very big lie on their part. But court somehow ignored that. Also, it seems like they deliberately chose a 'noth-eastern' girl to put forward the narrative that North-Eastern girls are more likely to be molested as she says in one of the scenes, this had nothing to do with the story and it felt 'extra' to me.
The film gives a good message but have it's short-comings, I'm sure the general audience will and have ignored it. The acting performances are A-grade and some of the messages are hard hitting. Go Watch it."

Simple,a girl gets harassed,she replies and then suffers because of the might the INNOCENT victim,until a man fighting for a just cause intervenes.The flow is linear but is never boring,keeps to at your seat till the end.U realize what will happen next,but u still want to watch it.ACTING and CAST
Casting has been great,,Taapsee has blood grown as an actor,and is garnishing praises from all aroung,,Kirti has done so many decent movies,and is yet to be rated,supporting cast is really good especially Angad,,,but the show belongs to Amitabh sir,,fantastic,an actor for generations to watch and take inspiration from.
The actors were never out of phase,,writing too was pretty good,and everyone performs brilliantly.DIRECTION and SCREENPLAY
Some weaknesses,,few scenes were not necessary,,some angles were not implicated and touched(that's why a minus 1),but other than that,the work was fascinating.The whole team deserves an applause!Must watch for Indian audiences who need to shed that old mentality and also start respecting women,,,NO means NO!!!!!"

I wanted the focus to be on the case and how the antagonists are going to be punished, not some preachy shtick. The lawyers seemed way too melodramatic and I just can't believe at one point one of the women straight up lied ""to end an argument"" No. That's nonsense. If you believe in your truth, you fight for it. Not let it ""end"". This movie is essentially the 21st century Bible for anyone that believes that women should be housewives and not be independent.

I thought that the 'crime scene/party scene' will be shown as a flashback during the interrogation as usually done in Bollywood films but it didn't. Instead, all the facts and evidences were shown as what the normal court does. And it was great. Amitabh's act as the lawyer of the ladies is outstanding. For me, all the court scenes and dialogues of Amitabh are the highlights of the movie. The last scene, which is the closing argument of Amitabh is superb. The showing of the 'crime/party scene' on the closing credits is also outstanding."

",0.0,0.9878,2018-10-15 00:00:00,9,"PINK - The latest from Shoojit Sircar stable is a very socially relevant film for the current generation and mindset. The film follows three girls who after a night of partying have a run in with the local politicians son accidentally injuring him and the aftermath that ensues. The movie depicts what independent women in this day and age has to go through in this society, the trials and tribulations faced in a crisis, the judgemental views of the oligarchic, feudal chauvinist society. 
The movie moves at a brisk pace keeping the audience fully immersed in the proceedings pulling you in from the word go. The second half although a bit lagging is the best part where the court proceedings takes place and the actors bring out their full acting prowess. The movie belongs to Amitabh Bachan who is just brilliant as a senile bipolar lawyer who fights for the girls' cause. Every dialogue is applause worthy thanks to super writing albeit a bit dramatic. 
Also full marks to Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kharbanda whose emotional outburst is super. A special mention to the actor who plays the antagonists' friend is a reveal. The only let down was the climatic verdict by the judge relying on emotion rather than legal evidence. 
Let's teach our boys how to treat women with respect and love."

One of the girls hit a glass bottle on one of the boy's heads. Later the women are charges with prostitution and the one who hit the bottle is also charged with attempt to murder. In the trail the girls are tried to strip of their modesty.I have never been to the bar, but I have seen movies that highlight the stereotypes to be true. Stereotypes like women (single) having drinks in a bar are available (mostly). But then comes the 'no' factor, even a prostitute has a right to say no.What I liked: In the court room it's said, judge knows everything from the beginning. Despite that he gives decision according to the evidence submitted. As a result there may be bad decisions declared. The movie pink is not that. Here the judgment given stays true to the incidences occurred.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Music: A song along with verses at last, both are good. Acting: Justified. Final Verdict: As discussed earlier I liked the movie because of courts judgment, despite the girls were in trial against powerful people. The movie is worth watching and adding to your collection."

" Delhi on trial
",0.0,-0.9918,2018-07-13 00:00:00,9,"I saw this movie only yesterday and was moved by it. It is an excellent movie that depicts the struggles of women in India and more specifically Delhi. It is a story of sexual assault in Delhi and various trials and tribulations that victims have to go through just to survive let alone prevail.This movie is based in Delhi and I don't think it is by any coincidence. Delhi has gotten the moniker of ""Rape Capital"" and I don't think it is totally wrong. There are certain subtle and not so subtle reasons that lead to rape in Delhi. What I am not sure is whether Delhi is unique in it.I write this review assuming Delhi, its population and its system, is one of the characters in this movie. I believe there are are multiple reasons why there are so many rapes in Delhi but I would like to concentrate on system, society and boys of Delhi.1 System: By system I mean law enforcement and judicial system. They are extremely powerful systems but they are also the most inefficient and can be easily bought by those that can exert power. As a default, law enforcement doesn't do much. You would hardly find a police officer stopping a crime even though there are various check points all over the city. Judiciary by default doesn't provide timely judgement and can not be counted upon. Additionally, you can buy the services of these systems relatively easily to do your bidding however illegal or immoral it may be. For example in this movie a police officer could be paid to create wrong police report and no one bats an eyelid. I am sure this can be done in other parts of the world too but it would require lot more effort and it will lead to big fall out if such a crime was to be caught. Judges in Delhi can be routinely bought. So two mechanism by which a victim could get justice and future crime could be deterred are used by perpetrators primarily as weapon in this city. Everybody knows this and therefore a victim is very wary to approach these two systems for protection just like the victims in this movie.2. Society: North Indian society that makes up Delhi, worships a number of Hindu goddesses. So they respect women but only when they stay on a small elevated pedestal. If women display any human tendencies the society consisting of men and women of all ages come out to put these women in their place. So this society gets very uncomfortable when a girl chooses her own mate, wears the clothes that are not prescribed by her parents, lives on her own or consumes alcohol. Fathers give up on their daughters and brothers give up on their sisters if they display desires that are considered natural in west. Honor killings are common in these parts and so is putting women behind closed doors for supposedly sake of their own safety. Rarely do we see this society rise and come to rescue women when they are doing things that are not within the narrow scope of what they are allowed. So a girl who wears short dresses and stays out till 9 pm with her boyfriend is considered to be asking for rape and will garner little support unless she dies a gruesome death. A rape victim is usually forced into hiding as if she has somehow invited the rape as opposed to going after the perpetrator. The same society which judges girls so much doesn't judge its boys at all. They have a free reign to do pretty much whatever they want.3. Boys: The biggest culprit are these boys and man children. A wide swath of boys grow up with very little contact with women other than their mother and sisters if they have one. This is because society frowns upon any contact between boy and girl before marriage. Most grow up with no knowledge of what women want. In their mind the women should be pious and stay away from boys like him. When they see a women that smiles and talk nicely to them it just messes up their value system and they start degrading such women even though that is exactly what they desire. Women and girls are well aware of this dynamic and they stay away from all boys and this leads to a positive feedback. Only way to get female companionship in this situation is to either get married or get it by power. Power means spending money on prostitutes but it also means rape. Most boys/men are well aware that a women is not protected by either the system or society. There is a good chance that they can get away with using force against women. Forcible rape in moving car on gunpoint are more common then any of us would care to admit. Forming a group with similar motives that includes harassing a women is not difficult. It is almost like people around you are egging you to do it and ready to be your helper by either driving the car or making threats on your behalf or protecting you if you ever get in trouble. Targets are plenty and easy picking with very minor consequences if it ever comes to that. Shoojit Sircar captured all of this in his movie very well. He did show a corrupt system ruling over apathetic impotent society in which powerful boys go after targets with utter impunity. If target fights back then the first instinct of perpetrator is to put them in their place and teach them a lesson just like shown in this movie. Often they are successful. This movie shows this struggle and highlights a case where things don't go as usual. In doing so it shines the light on what we are doing wrong.Amitabh was excellent as an aging retired lawyer who understands this struggle. He is fighting his own demons but gathers himself to fight this one last battle on behalf of victims. Taapsi, Kirti and Andrea acted beautifully depicting independent women with hopes and desires but are hunted by these boys with help of system and not protected by society. Lots of girls get broken or give up. Movie beautifully depicts their anguish and the hard decisions they have to make just to preserve themselves .The entire cast deserves kudos to play the roles they were given. This include prosecution lawyer who is paid to harass the victims in the court or the friend of perpetrator who aid and abet him. Lady constable did talk in perfect haryanvi and did capture the rotten portion of the system.This is a must watch movie and we don't see enough of such movies in Hindi."
" Brilliant

Another sad reality is that a ""Hindi masala movie"" will earn millions of viewers whereas real movies like these will hardly earn any viewers."

" This film isn't about good morals ... why are the reviewers confused ?
",-0.5727,-0.719,2018-01-23 00:00:00,3,"This is not a film that espouses any moral values like good character, not fornicating before marriage, avoiding alcohol or being a woman/man of dignified conduct / honourable character.
The three young women in this film live as roommates,work,date,fornicate,imbibe alcohol,party without dignity & go out roaming with shady characters to remote locations , at suspicious hours.This film is solely about one thing - Consent.While it's a sorry state of affairs that Indians think that they are entitled to act in immoral ways ( in their personal lives ) in the name of being 'modern' or have a bar set so low, that merely being 'consensual adults' is pass marks for any activity - this still is a very important film for this country - esp. the Hindi belt in North India ( considering the patriarchal mindset that a woman's consent means nothing or that if she is of questionable character / wears cheap western clothes / partakes of alcohol / is overfriendly - "" she's asking for it "" or "" needs to be taught a lesson ."" )Amitabh Bachchan doesn't dissapoint.Considering how many women are victimized in India , this film should be part of the curriculum in boys schools / panchayats / police training academies & law colleges ( for the future lawyers who defend rapists , by attacking the victim's character. )"
" The world we are heading towards
",0.0,-0.7286,2018-01-13 00:00:00,10,"It is quite clearly depicted in a movie that NO is not just a mere word its a statement and most often not speaking for whole world instead for India only, we have so many sections in our Criminal Law and when we go through it we will find there are certain special sections just for the security for the women for e.g. Dowry, Rape, Molestation, Stalking e.t.c. It is a trend in India that whenever a wrong takes place specially with women it gathers media attention but nowadays even media is tired of running these headlines on their channels. Anyway, the second thing happens is if the women is alive she will go through court proceedings, media interviews and that too only if media makes it a big news and if it becomes a big issue then Government start showing its false concern over the issue, and if she is dead there might be candle march/ protest which sooner or later people will tend to forget because in that time span who knows how many new cases have been risen, new laws or amendments would have also been made but the what is done is done no one can fill the gap that is made by the ""MAN ORIENTED"" society we have created.
The fact being why is there a need for such special laws for women, why are there amendments in the existing laws. By creating these laws we are not protecting women rather we are showing how vulnerable a women can be. We can think foul for someone else's sister or mother but we can't hear a single thing about our mother or sister. 
The need is that how can we make this group of society understand that women is not a thing for their enjoyment instead they are equal part of society. Like men even they have their opinions and their lives. 
The day will be marked in history when the laws relating to women will be scraped from law because there is no need of it."
" Great, until it became unrealistic preaching.
",0.6249,0.7912,2018-01-10 00:00:00,5,"Pink (2016) ""No. No, your honor. 'No' is not a word. It is a complete sentence. It doesn't need any further explanation. 'No' simply means 'no'. My client said no', your honor and these boys must realize that 'no' means 'no' whether the girl is an acquaintance, a friend, girlfriend, or a sex worker. Or even your own wife! 'No' means no'! I want someone says so, you stop."" The Good: 
* Makes important statements regarding social issues includes consent, double standards for females and males, inherent biases, molestation, misogyny, rape, self defense, social strata, and violence against women. This is especially relevant in India, where rapes often go unreported for to fear of public shame and possibly (as portrayed in the film) having it backfire. It is still frowned upon by some for a girl to be independent, outspoken, willful, or to drink or go anywhere in private with a male. 
* Amitabh Bachchan, due to his seniority, was originally first listed in the credits. However, to show gender equality, he requested to have his name listed after the three leading ladies. It is great to know that the actor was as passionate about gender quality as his character was in the film. 
* A clever creative choice was showing the scene of what actually happened that night, in slow motion, during the credits. Be sure to wait for that. The Bad: 
* Great acting overall by the three leading ladies, but they were quite melodramatic. It alternated between an impressive performance and a performance completely overdone. 
* Bachchan may have had a powerful presence, but he was also creepy. Whatever the reasons, his breathing mask, combined with his mysterious demeanor and harsh voice, made for more of a creepy presence. Add to that the angles that made his eyes look white in many scenes, he was straight up scary. Supposedly he had bipolar, but I do not even know why that was a detail. The Ugly: 
* Unrealistic portrayal of a court debate. These lawyers would not be a allowed to intimidate and yell at the witnesses on the stand, practically coercing them into a false confession. Likewise, they would not be allowed to preach on topics irrelevant to the case. The case becomes a stage for feminism, narrated by Bachchan. 
* Makes important points, but crosses the line very early on into preaching. To the point that I might call this propaganda. 
* Unrealistic to the point that I could not take it seriously and became bored in the second hour of this unnecessarily long film. Conclusion: Many memorable lines, overall good performances,, made a valuable case for many important social issues; but excessive in length, portrayed court cases unrealistically, and it became preaching (practically) propaganda."

A movie having a very different message that when a girl says NO, she could be anyone, your girl friend, your date, your wife or even a sex worker, it means a NO. Everyone might have different views on it, but i'll recommend it to must watch - you'd not be disappointed."
" Just what Bollywood needs.
",0.0,0.8218,2017-08-12 00:00:00,9,"Pink delivers an extremely crucial message by first explaining the subtleties, and then dismantling the logic behind, rape culture. It does this without any light moments, and still manages to keep the viewer fully engaged from start to finish. Amitabh Bachchan, Tapsee Pannu, and Piyush Mishra deliver powerful performances as the film builds very carefully to an increasingly exciting climax. Exactly as such court cases build in reality. This is very difficult to achieve, but is masterfully executed by the direction and script. The soundtrack is, in a word, epic. Seeing as the film discusses a global issue, similarly the music also pulls on the different sounds and cries of the world. These sounds are accentuated by the glorious poetry and lyricism of India, serving to drive home the heavy emotions packed in this film. I highly recommend this film."
" Excellent, Outstanding, don't read the story-line (spoiler), just watch it.

Judge it yourself.I liked everything about this movie, script, direction, main cast, acting, songs, lyrics and its surprisingly superb soundtrack.Amitabh Bachchan excels, in re-inventing himself for this role and its execution.Impressive acting by the girls, especially Kirti Kulhari(as Falak Ali) and Tapsee Pannu(Minal Arora). Andrea Tariang (Andrea) doesn't disappoint either despite being a debutante. And yes Dhritiman Chatterjee (Judge Satyajeet Dutt) too needs a mention who flawlessly plays his part."
" Contrived

I also give the film makers kudos for the unique way in which the story unfolds; the details of the evening unravelling with the questioning of each witness. And the masterful scenes during the end credits.However, once again, we have an excellent premise which is failed in execution.The court case scenes failed to build realism and instead became farcical drama where the lawyers either spewed commentary or attempted to advance their case with witness ""gotcha moments"". It was clichÃ© and reminiscent of court dramas of 1980.The defence's case appeared to rest more on sentiment than evidence. And the apparent *blow to the defence's story during one particular testimony was left completely unaddressed. I was frustrated beyond belief because it seemed completely far fetched that these women with gusto (shouting from their seats in court) were moments later, cowering excessively on the witness stand.Amitabh Bachchan's acting was sublime and played the quirkiness of the role brilliantly. However, he seemed to step out of character in his more final court appearances."
" Thank you
",0.3612,0.9551,2017-06-17 00:00:00,10,"Thank you for making such a great movie. I would love to heart fully thank each and everyone involved in making this movie. It has shown every girls most encountered problems in day to day life. There are men from a flamboyant or powerful backgrounds who abuse the system and get out of the crimes they did. ""No"" means ""No"", thanks for establishing that point. How far a normal working guy/girl can fight in this corrupted system of ours, if there is no person like Mr. Deepak Sehgal. How a country of rich culture, degraded to a piece of dump that objectifies women. Well written story and well directed screenplay.Please continue to make more movies that enlighten the narrow minded youth of our country. Sincere regards from a whole lot of people who felt the same."
" Challenging You To Think
",0.1531,0.979,2017-06-16 00:00:00,10,"Challenging You To ThinkVery few Bollywood movies can truly lay their claim upon the fact that after you have watched them, you will be challenged to think. They are riveting and intriguing in equal proportions. In this category and genre, I will like to fit in last year's movie - Pink. The movie's content, message, script, dialogues and screenplay is so potent and powerful that it grips you right from the first scene. If I may just try my bit to dissect the Movie, then I would say Pink is a court - room drama or it encompasses a Rule Book of the Girls Safety Manual or it revolves around a debate or it is an amalgamation of mystery and thriller substance. Nevertheless, what Pink does I will write about that. It breaks lot of preconceived notions, and preconceptions which are prevalent and widespread in our society currently. Very brilliantly and brazenly Pink takes a dig and potshot at the stereotypical norms, rules and prejudices which we knowingly or unknowingly have towards women. Pink is not trying to preach something, it is not trying to give a lecture over Women's Safety, it is not Moral Science Lesson about what is right and wrong, it is not trying to take sides. It is just trying, urging and challenging us all to Think. In a nut - shell Pink is a Reality - Check. Backed by electrifying performances by Amitabh Bachchan, Piyush Mishra, Dhritiman Chatterjee and three girls assayed by Tapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari and Andrea Tariang, flawless writing (screenplay, dialogues and script courtesy - Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, Shoojit Sircar and Ritesh Shah), exemplary and untarnished Direction by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury make Pink a must watch and also which one cannot afford to miss. And I bet, when the end credits roll midst the background music plus the Poem recited by Amitabh Bachchan himself, you will feel an urge to think."
" Tell me where do I belong to a sick society?

Our society accepts women blunders so famously, where men are not the victims of this transgression. If the beauty of law rules the world, then we can see a better world."
" A well made movie with a good message
",0.6124,0.9735,2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"This is a very well made movie that successfully highlights the narrow-minded thinking of many (Indian) men. A simple smile or a touch by a female friend is all that is needed for such men to assume that the girl is interested in them and sometimes they even go as far as viewing it as an invitation for a physical relationship. Glad to see a movie made on this subject. I think all the actors have done a great job. Only reason I have taken out 2 stars is because at times I felt the acting was unnecessarily a bit dramatic in the lines of a typical Bollywood movie. When you make a movie with a pure social message such as this, then it will be most effective if everything is 100% authentic regardless of how big the actor is."
" Depicts the truth of our society!!
",0.4374,0.5048,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie really explains, what is wrong with our society and where the actual problem is. Whole story is elaborated so nicely, I very much felt frustration against people like those, that I see all the time. Putting restrictions on girls and judging them by their dress has always been common in our country. I here quote a dialogue: ""Drinking is bad character for girls but only a health hazard for boys"".Everyone did a really great job. Story is kept simple and close to real. The facts presented by movie are very straight forward and make you think, what fact or logic some perverts don't understand. Really provoking and is a must watch movie!!"
" Good for reality, not for fiction.
",0.4404,-0.3261,2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"I want to say things about how the movie fails as a movie. And not whether it depicts the society correctly or not. First and most clear thing which gets noted is that the protagonist was forming a Rule Book on Women Safety. It appears that the main aim of the movie was to make Hittchicker's Guide for the Women Safety in Indian Society. The protagonist says his thoughts out loud amid the court sessions while everybody listens to him as if it is relevant to the case. It is totally irrelevant to the case and waste time of the court. This should have been shown as a side thought in the protagonists mind. There are some other blunders. At the end of first court session, there are no arguments against the antagonist and protagonist's client is proved guilty. The decision should have come then and there. But no there were other sessions as well. Then in one proceeding, protagonist objects the antagonist for filling in the details of his clients statement while questioning. And it was right thing to do. But later, when protagonist questions his client, he completes the story of which his client has told only a small part. Not only that, he also tells few rule for his safety manual. C'mon, this is unaccounted authority given to the protagonist. In most Bollywood movies, the same is true. Finally, when there is no hope left for protagonist to win, accuser/antagonist's client(accuser as he filed the case) confesses. There is no pressure on him. He gets angry on seeing a photo of his sister doing nothing. He starts talking badly. And finally confesses that she(accused) deserved it what happened to her. This ending could have been really made better. It seems like there was lack of content and/or running time left with the producers/directors. They were in a hurry to finish the movie."
