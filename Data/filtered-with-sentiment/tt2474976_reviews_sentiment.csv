What a waste of time, from the get go the characters make the stupidest decisions.
Then everything just gets even dumber, what was the point? Why did the mosters even want the baby, to make a family? so they want to hurt everyone else but keep the baby so they can have a family, on and on running back and fourth not much too this one really at all, you see everything coming, no real scares just tension cause you don't want to see a baby get hurt but with parents making the poorest choices ever the entire time you don't think it has much of a chance."

Fantastic cinematography and setting
Good riff on an old fairytale story without any of the cheesiness that often comes with that idea.

" Very good director's debut film
",0.4927,0.9618,2020-08-01 00:00:00,6,"The Hallow is a full-length debut of director Corin Hardy. He debuted at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. The plot tells about London conservationist Adam (Joseph Mawle) and his wife Clare (Bojana Novakovic) moved with their son to a remote house surrounded by an Irish forest.
The film begins with a wonderful atmosphere of the Irish forest, cloudy weather, fogs, dullness. Suspense is growing with every frame. With a modest budget, the ambiance is created by pale colors and dialogues. This is the most successful part of the film. But then the forest creatures enter the scene. They are the combination of practical effects and CGI. There are representatives with successful computer graphics in the cohort of low-budget films, but low-budget films and graphics are not compatible. This film is another confirmation of this. With the appearance of poorly drawn creatures on the screen, all the gloomy atmosphere, so well created in the first part, disappears in an instant.
An indisputable advantage is the acting. They very well conveyed the emotions of parents fighting for the life of their child. The gloomy atmosphere is replaced by a completely standard action game with a fight in the house and forest. In the end, the plot twist reawakens interest and the final impression is benevolent.
Fans of this genre should watch this horror film. You won't regret it if you do."

" ""The Hallow"" is a bit Shallow
",0.0,-0.9052,2019-02-16 00:00:00,6,"Plot in a Nutshell: Set in Ireland, a young family is terrorized in their 'cabin in the woods' by an ancient malevolent force.Why I rated it a '6': Film doesn't quite deliver on its promise. Started slow, picked up steam but then degenerated into bad character decisions and silliness by the end. Plenty of jump-scares and shadowy figures running in front of the camera. That's new. There was also something about a 'parasitic fungus' which unnecessarily complicated what might have been an interesting tale based solely on Irish folklore. Instead we got some weird combination of myths and science which, although it has its moments, in the end leaves you wondering what this could have been. SFX not bad for what appears to be a lower-budget film.Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Probably not."
" Enjoyable if somewhat flawed creature feature
",0.4404,0.9659,2019-02-06 00:00:00,7,"Arriving at a remote Irish villa, a couple and their infant son who are looking to mark a local area of the forest for a logging experiment find their neighbors' tale about a group of creatures called The Hallow are true when they target their infant son and must race to save him from the beings.This one wasn't all that bad of an effort. One of the strongest elements of this one is the fact that it manages to readily offer up some rather impressive atmosphere of the Irish setting this is taking place in. The lush, bright green forest, moss-covered rocks and trees, and impenetrable layout all manage to provide the locations here with a stellar overall look that's impressively chilling, especially with the area's ability to dampen and hide caves and other outcrops for the beings to hide in unseen. Once the film goes into the idea of the creatures attacking the house, it generates some rather fun moments here. The first incidents that are shown to trigger something happening with the creatures give this a decent start to the proceedings later on where they try to escape the house. Filled with some solid scenes of them driving through a field of creatures trying to get away to the barricade inside the abandoned house trying to prevent them from getting to their infant which results in one of the finest scenes in the film of them trying to retrieve it once he gets captured. The finale, with the descent into the creatures' lair and showing the way they react to him as he slowly becomes one of them while trying to protect his child has some great ideas at play here which really gives this a lot to like overall. As well, the creatures look great once we get to see them and helps to hold this one up overall as there are some problems with this one. Among the film's biggest transgressions is the absolutely banal and long-winded setup this goes through in the first half that just takes forever to get going. There's not much of anything going on with the endless scenes of the family puttering around the house as they argue about the absolutely trivial matters of their lives which manages to really slow down the interest of this one considerably during this part of the story where it's important to get this going and this banality that occurs at the beginning is quite hard to get through. The other real problem here is in it's confused and nonsensical storyline that doesn't really make much sense. The fact that once again people are given cryptic messages about what's going on within the film in regards to what the creatures are and then expect everyone to heed their warnings just because is an irritating ploy as they rightfully ignore such baseless meanderings. There's very little of any kind of information about the creatures, how they live or what they're society is like so in total the creatures are just plain mysterious. Coupled with some shoddy CGI in places and these hold the film back somewhat.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and continuous themes of children in jeopardy."
" The Hallow

He has a professional interest in the trees, and they have a young baby. And a dog. The locals, one in particular, are distinctly unfriendly, and Adam is warned to leave on account of The Hallow, prehistoric creatures who don't take kindly to English interlopers, or local ones for that matter. What do you think would be the reaction of a scientist to that kind of warning? Precisely.Although this film begins atmospherically, we are soon left in no doubt that The Hallow are very real, and just as soon Adam realises he should have upped and left with his family while he had the chance. There follows a night of utter terror, not least because the baby is kidnapped, and only retrieved with some difficulty by the lady of the house. Or is it really their baby?

" The dark side of nature
",0.0,-0.9443,2018-12-02 00:00:00,6,"Regardless of how overused the basic plot, executed with very hit and miss success on film, is, 'The Hallow' did have a good deal of potential. The idea was actually a good one, the title was to the point and attention grabbing and Joseph Mawle is always worth watching. So expectations were hardly low for 'The Hallow', and actually did think this could be a decent film. Of course too there was apprehension, considering the standard of a lot of horror films seen recently not highly rated or divisively to negatively reviewed that turned out to be that bad.A decent film 'The Hallow' turned out to be, and it is something of a relief to be saying this. Not a great film, with it running out of steam too soon and the quality set up so well before being lost. 'The Hallow' was quite good though for two thirds of the duration and while it didn't quite meet its potential it hardly wastes it either. Which pleased me having grown tired of the many potential wastes cropping up in my recent viewings and fearing somewhat that 'The Hallow' would fare the same.Will start with the good things. 'The Hallow' doesn't look too bad visually, it's stylishly and atmospherically shot, has scenery that is pretty and atmospheric, has suitably eerie lighting, has editing that is cohesive and the effects at least didn't look shoe-string budget (certainly when compared to those from other films seen recently). It is hauntingly and not too intrusively scored and the direction has focus and momentum.There is tension and suspense and a lot of genuine creepiness in particularly the middle act. That it is so in more than one way makes the execution fairly clever and fresh which is remarkable considering that the idea is hardly new. 'The Hallow' starts well but it's the middle act where it shines most where there are scenes that do unnerve. The creatures looked good and they did pose a formidable threat, would have liked to see them more though. The characters didn't bore or annoy me, while not exactly rich in character development there have been films that have done far worse regarding motivations and behaviours. Joseph Mawle commands the film well, standing out of an above average cast.So it is unfortunate that the final act was such a significant step down in quality, to the extent that it was hard to believe it was the same film. The suspense and creepiness dissipates and confusion and silliness replaces them, both to an excessive degree. It becomes muddled, from too much being left vague or unexplained, and ridiculous.Momentum sags badly particularly at this point, actually think that the pace was imperfect throughout but it was really only in some very uneventful stretches and some choppy storytelling that it did become bothersome. The dialogue is pretty weak, while the ending completely fails to make sense. Not many film endings recently have had me scratching my head, 'The Hallow' did that with me.In conclusion, decent but let down by the inferior final third. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
" Suspenseful and scary!
",-0.5411,0.8908,2018-11-15 00:00:00,6,"This is one you probably shouldn't watch alone, or watch at all if you're vacationing (or living) in a cabin in the woods. The setting alone was foreboding enough, let alone the things that go bump in the night! The acting was very good and the make-up and creature effects incredibly good and realistic. The movie will make you squirm at times. It offers a good dose of suspense, scares and a bit of gore, as well.I found the film very similar to 2014's 'From the dark', but this one added to the suspense by including an infant. Lets face it, who doesn't root for an innocent baby? If you're looking for a film that'll scare you and probably prevent you from going into the woods at night, this is the one. This is a great creature feature that delivers."
" (Sigh)...Ignore the negative reviews, this movie is pretty good..

'UNREALISTIC' scenes in a movie about fairies and monsters coming out of the woods and attacking people and turning people into vegetated zombies! I shake my head at this and am here once again to tell you all to enjoy a pretty decent horror movie and leave the notepad on the desk.
The lead actor was great. The tension builds up quickly and things really get going and doesn't let up until the end.
This is a spoiler here, but the father's attempts to get Claire the right baby and not have her leave with the 'pod' baby, or whatever you want to call it, really does make the ending of this movie. When a tear rolls down his cheek before dying after realizing she made the right choice, it is very touching and makes for a great ending.
Anyway...no, this movie is NOT the Lord of the Rings, or Aliens, or the best movie you will ever see in your life. It will not win any Oscars.
But get you a plate of chocolate chip cookies, get a roaring fire in the fireplace and sit down with your fam and get ready for some scares and a pretty good night of movie watching...and for God sakes, for future reference, don't come to this place first to read reviews and see if a movie is worth watching."

But soon he learns that there is something evil in the forest that wants Finn.""The Hallow"" is a horror film with great potential and promising story wasted by the terrible conclusion. The screenplay builds the tension perfectly, using few special effects. The climax is when Adam´s house is attacked by the evil creatures from the forest. But the writer did not know how to give explanations and conclude the film that becomes a lame mess. Somehow the conclusion gives the idea of being ecological but indeed it is terrible. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Maldição da Floresta"" (""The Curse of the Forest"")"

",0.6249,-0.2231,2018-11-04 00:00:00,8,"This is a good horror movie. No time is wasted getting the viewer scared, leading in with some, for me, very original 'walks in the dark', so to speak. Things quickly spiral out of control, yet despite that, intelligence has incorporated the back story for you, so you at least have some idea what things and why things are going very bump in the night. The effects could have benefited from cgi, but I suspect most people will disagree. The story itself was original enough for me to be impressed. Recommended."

The tension and chemistry between the main couple kept me glued to the screen, especially whenever their tiny baby is in danger. It was never cheesy, which can be a rare quality in indie horror movies. The atmosphere is what kept me feeling tense throughout this movie, not necessarily a specific monster, and that was the brilliant part. I felt like I was experiencing the horror with them, not just watching it happen to them."
" Nice little atmospheric horror film without any body count n jump scares but the tension is maintained.
",-0.6073,0.8309,2018-04-22 00:00:00,7,"Saw this on a rented dvd. Been on my radar for a long time.
The plot is about a couple and their infant baby who moves into the backwoods of Ireland.
The male (Joseph Mawle) who is an expert in microbiology has come to inspect the trees for clearance. He is warned by the local (Michael McElhatton) not to trespass the forests as the ""hallows"" will trespass into his house n steal his baby. One nite the window of the infant's room is broken but the couple is assured by the local cop (Michael Smiley) not to worry as some bird must have done it. In the beginning one will wonder why the scene of the wife (Bojana Novakovic) removing the iron grill is shown. Even the repair guy tells the husband that his wife shudnt have removed the iron grills. There is an explanation for that but not a logical one. Even the film became a lil silly towards the end.
The film moves at a decent pace n from the beginning there is a sense of dread. Also whenever a baby is in peril, the film becomes even more tension filled. 
Tension is maintained throughout n the effects were pretty good. Some may be bored as there is not enuff creature action n the body count is almost zero. But if u enjoy atmospheric horror film with enuff moments of tension then u will enjoy this film.
I wish Michael Smiley's role was bigger as i like that actor's comic timings n his face itself is smiley like his surname."

" A Proper Horror Film...
",-0.5719,0.9732,2018-03-03 00:00:00,7,"This is a very special horror film... because it's a horror film! This flick really does meet all the criteria of the genre... Secluded house in the woods; Check. Something strange happening in the woods; Check. Monsters of fairy tales and legend; Check. A newlywed couple with a newborn child; Check. Tension to create fear; Check. Atmosphere to give a nice spooky eerieness; Check. Special effects to make you shake and shudder; Check.The only thing this appears to be missing is a priest and a few teenagers, but hey! I can live without them.When I read the blurb of the story I knew I had to watch the film. Adam's (Mawle) new job as a woodsman in Ireland's last forest, brings his family to a secluded millhouse. On one of his investigations of the woodland, he comes across the carcass of a dead animal, which has a strange substance growing out of it. Taking a sample, he finds it to be a living organism... one that can destroy it's hosts cells. But before he can make the report other, more violent events occur. At first, he believes it's the locals as they see him as the enemy since he works for the men wanting to pulp the trees. But before long, he and Claire (Novakovic) begin to realise that it's not the locals they need to be afraid of.The film is beautifully shot and the opening sequence sets the atmosphere for the rest of the movie very well. Though the new family are smiling and looking forward to a prosperous future, the overcast sky gives the feeling of a storm ready to break... things are not going to be sunny for this family. The pace is quite meandering and builds slowly into soft peaks, this has the effect of letting the tension and unease get under your skin. Not just a hack slash and scream film. Along with some strong acting from the cast, it makes the film very enjoyable.The thing I liked about the characters is their ordinariness. This makes them more believable and easier to relate too. The only actor that appears to go a little over the top is the Police Officer, Garda Davey (Smiley), though I do know people of the same temperament as him so I can overlook it. It's the subtleness of the actor's and actress' portrayals that make this film stronger, especially Mawle, who does a good concerned wonder.However, there are a few drawbacks. The main one being the creatures themselves. these are meant to be the Fairies and Banshees, etc, of Irish myth. But, to me, they look nothing like you would expect. It would have been nice to see smaller Fairies and screechier Banshees, for a start. But these are minor things, they may have added a strength to the overall film, however, as they are, they don't detract the viewer from the story at all.If you're a lover of real horror films then this one is for you. It's one I'll be only too happy to watch again... and again..."
" Slightly disappointing
",-0.4417,-0.8082,2018-02-06 00:00:00,4,"A couple with a young child move to rural Ireland & meet hostility from the locals - but far worse horrors are to come from mythical creatures that live in the woods where their house is situated. There are plenty of scary creatures here and the special effects are adequate. But two things let this film down in my opinion.
Firstly I did not like Joseph Mawle in the role of Adam. Not because of his acting ability, I just couldn't get into his character. Secondly the onslaught of the creatures on the family started too soon & therefore lasted too long. Towards the end I just wanted the credits to roll."

It is filmed with that tedious green filter, which is just annoying. The film starts introducing monsters, but they look random: some are like human zombies, others are inhuman... And what powers do they have? Apparently infinite powers. They can make the radio in your car stop working, they can materialize in front of your car at will, throw rocks at you from a huge distance... I hate monsters that are not defined. I want to know what the monster is and what it can do. If the monster can do anything, then what is the bloody point? You can't predict what's coming, and you know that the writer is going to throw in more and more super powers. It's a staple of bad screen writing. And as for jump scares, they are fine in a horror film, but if that's all the film is, then it's just lazy writing. I hated the script, and I hated the direction. I hope this guy never makes a film again. And another thing: when someone breaks into your house, destroys your car, and smashes all your stuff, while you have a baby in the house, you do not start screaming how you intend to take on this guy on your own, while refusing to leave. Rather, you pack your bags and you drive off.Just another poorly written time-waster of a movie. Zero stars."

",0.2263,0.8837,2017-07-25 00:00:00,6,Better than probably many horror films. Not scary but had enough action to keep it interesting. The setting in the woods alone was creepy enough and some of the twists and turns were interesting. I wouldn't go out of my way to see this film. When they were under siege they had some pretty good creature attacks.
" Interesting concept, but you'll scream from frustration, not terror
",-0.4915,-0.9865,2017-05-18 00:00:00,3,"""Elves are terrific, the beget terror"" -Terry Pratchett, Lords and LadiesFairy tales were the original horror stories, so a return to the source is a refreshing departure from the Tinker Bells and Caspers of today. And the woodland creatures in The Hallows are creepy enough to fit the bill.However, the oblivious, bumbling, pig-headed stupidity of the male lead will so frustrate you, you'll start to wish he'd die faster. His much-smarter-than-him wife is constantly calling his name like the teacher from Beuller as he completely ignores her and does yet another idiotic thing that gets him stabbed in the eye. Further aggravation is to be had as the writers ignore traditional lore and begin making up their own rules, twisting the Fae until they more closely resemble contagious alien vampires. Freaky they are, accurate they are not. And then they start contradicting the guidelines they made up for themselves.To conclude, the cool practical effects and few scary moments are not enough to save this ultimately irritating and dumb movie."
" Slightly dragged out.
",0.024,0.296,2017-02-16 00:00:00,7,"The hallow is a fairly typical horror movie, family stays in a secluded house surrounded by a forest and strange things start to happen. Despite this however it is still an enjoyable film to watch and the monsters are somewhat original. The atmosphere of the film is tense and is mildly scary for those of us horror fanatics. The acting was decent although at some stages the script leaves a little something to be desired. The make up and special effects teams are both to be applauded, great effects. There wasn't any real character development besides seeing how the characters react to the situations thrown at them. I did feel that the film was slightly dragged out and could've done with a few unimportant scenes being edited out. Overall though its a good one watch film."
" Why such low ratings?? And hey, it's GoT's Benjen Stark!!
",-0.4667,0.9731,2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"I do not write that many reviews on here, but after reading the other reviews, I felt compelled to write this and stand up for this movie!! I personally thought it was EXCELLENT with only a few (very few) flaws. I read many reviews stating that this movie was unoriginal and had been done over and over in other titles. Perhaps so, but then again, it seems to be a difficult thing to do in the horror genre...I mean really, look at how many Friday the 13th movies there are, and how many vampire movies, and how many haunted house stories, and exorcisms, etc. So what if this has a similar plot to others? The main thing is that it was just plain good.First off, the two main characters are extremely likable and you find yourself rooting for them. They are NOT the typical stupid college kids that just go to the woods to get drunk and have sex and act like bullies or stuck up snobs. One reviewer said that there was no one famous in it - I disagree. The father's character is also Benjen Stark from Game of Thrones!! I do not personally know much about the mother and her other roles, but she did a fine job acting. Also, they did what normal people would do - they tried to flee!! They tried to save their baby!! There are no scantily clad women running around, there are no jerk/jock boyfriends that deserved to die as in soo many other horror movies that try to use nudity to capture the audience's attention.I'm not going to give too many spoilers here, but let's just say the basic premise of the movie involves the mythical ""changelings"". One reviewer didn't understand why there were two babies - just read up on changelings and you won't be confused anymore.The setting in the woods were absolutely gorgeous, and the director even was thoughtful enough to bring in smaller details regarding changelings, such as the iron scissors on the door for protection. Kudos to him for bringing in elements of the original mythology.As for the scare factors and the creature/monster effects - absolutely EXCELLENT for such a small budget. It's nice being able to have a clear view of the creatures, and they looked amazing. Someone else said the creatures reminded them of Pan's Labyrinth, but this reviewer also gave Pan's Labyrinth only 1 star. The creature effects were very, very good. I don't know if they were CGI or just great costuming and make- up. There were some seriously intense scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat - such as when the father is in the trunk of the car, or when the mother was trying to hold down the attic door with the slimy ooze ""hand"" going for her eye. Some reviewers called it a slow movie - come on, what did they expect? So what if the movie took 10 minutes to give us some background? Geez, people are so critical. It's a MOVIE, it's there to entertain us, give it chance!! I am even tempted to give the movie 10 stars (and no, I'm not part of the production crew giving it a false high rating). The main reason that I take away a star is because the baby crying so much was annoying... But then again, you'd cry too if dozens of demonic looking forest fairies start attacking you in your baby crib.So please - give this movie a chance. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. Considering the fact that I mainly watch horror movies and nothing else, this one was a gem!!"
" OK for a horror
",-0.1943,0.9726,2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,This was not to bad it did lack in some areas but the movie had a good feel to it.Good acting beautifully shot and not bad jump scares. I think it was filmed in Ireland as it was very green but that made it look cool.I feel it could have been better but it was not awful. I did like the scene in the car with the baby that was tense and fearful.Not big names in this but they did OK with the material.Worth a watch on a rainy afternoon with a coffee.I would tell my mates to give it a watch if they had 85 minutes to spare.The ending was a good idea though! Better than most crap that is out there though!The main actors did what they were suppose to do with the limited story.At the end of the day an OK horror to give a go. Reminds me of Antichrist in areas.
