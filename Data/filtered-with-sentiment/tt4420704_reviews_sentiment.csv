" Stunning!!
",0.4912,0.9745,2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,"This was so adorable! As a cat owner and lover myself I needed to see this - and I can tell you my expectations aren't disappointed. What I liked most was the camera work, the beautiful scenery of Istanbul and how authentic the dialogs and everything was. Cats are just our little fluffy companions in life. They carry so much love in their hearts, it's a true blessing."
" Wonderfully Made Cat Documentary
",0.5994,0.9011,2020-07-29 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed watching this documentary. The camera work is wonderful and the people and cats selected to feature are interesting and engaging. Also, there is a lot of variety in the subjects of the documentary. Everything is about the cats of Istanbul, but each has his or her own story and personality.I do think it dragged a little at the end. I know the director wanted it to be feature length, but then end was not as powerful as the beginning and middle.Its definitely for cat lovers."
" Nice one
",0.4215,0.8934,2020-07-07 00:00:00,9,"Me and my cat enjoyed this film/documentary very much. I guess all cat lovers and owners will too.
The fact that cameta is most of the time at cat level really makes this film interesting. Plus all the cats are really really cute.Besides that, you get to see Istanbul in the background. I have been to Istanbul 3 times but I have to admit I do not remember cats at all. On the other hand I do remember cats of Morocco and Tunis.9 from me."
" The Cats of Istanbul
",0.0,0.9958,2020-06-30 00:00:00,8,"A film about cats. Well, this was certainly something that attracted my attention. Okay, it probably isn't the only film about cats out there, but it is actually more of a documentary, and not one of the National Geographic ones either. No, it is actually pretty specific because it is about the cats of the city of Istanbul.A couple of years ago, when I was travelling through South-East Asia I discovered that Muslims seem to have an affinity for cats. This was particularly the case in Malaysia, and especially the case on the island of Phi Phi. Yeah, it turned out that Phi Phi island is crawling with cats, so I decided to do some digging and I came across this film. The thing is that Istanbul is also crawling with cats, and this is basically a documentary about this rather interesting trait that the city holds.They suggested that the reason there are so many cats in Istanbul is that when they built the sewers it literally attracted a plague of rats (though it might have been earlier than that). So, to deal with the rats the inhabitants introduced cats, and they literally exploded from there. Mind you, these aren't your typical house cats like we have here in Australia (and other parts of the Western World), these are cats that just simply wander around the streets and make their home wherever.In a way, as they say at the beginning of the film, the cats don't have masters, rather they are just free to come and go as they please, and they simply attach themselves to certain places and certain people. Yeah, sure, there is this concept here in the West that cats don't have masters, they have staff, but as I indicated, the cats in Instabul are free to come and go as they please, and they just end up attaching themselves to individuals, which is what I noticed around parts of South East Asia.This is a rather delightful film, and while the focus is on cats, they do explore the changing nature of Istanbul. They also speak with numerous people in the city, and their relationships with the cats. In a way they consider them to be not just a part of their lives, but a part of the city. It is interesting how some people even suggest that these cats give them a life of their own. Yeah, it is a rather delightful film, and really does capture an essence of Istandbul that probably most people have no idea about. In fact, it makes me want to go there just to see all the cats."
" A cat documentary for cat people.
",0.0,0.6705,2020-06-05 00:00:00,8,'Kedi' is a thoughtful and profoundly moving documentary that explores the hidden lives of Istanbul's street cats. Truly a cat documentary for cat people.
" Spay and neuter

It's wonderful to see people feed and care about the cats but if you really really care and educate yourself you have to spay and neuter them!!! It's so so important. This movie could have been educating about it ....
" The 4-pawed Citizens of Istanbul
",0.0,0.9837,2020-02-02 00:00:00,8,"It's nice to see how appreciated the street cats on Istanbul are for the citizens. This documentation shows the different characters of the cats and how people live with them on the streets. It's a very nice movie, surely made of cat lovers - people who care about cats. The cats behavior is told in an interesting way. I would have given it a full 10/10 if it had a more suspending background music. I did like the stories of the portrayed street cats. Cats are soooo cute! :D"
" Not worth

" Enjoyable
",0.4404,0.6301,2019-12-12 00:00:00,7,"Even though this documentary is not about the city of Istanbul, it would be impossible to have its importance ignored when telling the stories of one of its main residents. It certainly manages to hide the negatives of this chaotic city, focusing solely on the cats' perspective and the people who care about them. It was mostly enjoyable though it got a little repetitive due to non dynamic pacing.Stories of a few cats who live in Istanbul and people who surround them."
" A Kind & Gentle Documentary
",0.743,0.9571,2019-06-22 00:00:00,9,"I normally steer well clear of any film involving our animal friends as something terrible usually happens to them. It is upsetting enough in real life without having to endure it in a film as well. Kedi is not like that & you can safely watch without fear of any sadness. It might even restore your faith in human beings. The people who interact with the cats in this documentary are all kind. Even the big rough & tough fishermen have a caring approach to the animals.
With so many documentaries around about people doing awful things to other people & things it is extremely refreshing to have something like this film to give some balance. I had a smile on my face the entire two hour run time.
If you are an animal person, especially if you like cats, I absolutely, highly recommend this lovely documentary to you."
" A city as majestic as its cats and as great as its people.
",0.6249,0.9931,2019-05-25 00:00:00,8,"I am a huge cat person so I was naturally invested in this documentary, and I don't recall ever seeing something on the subject of Istanbul and its hugely unique population of cats, which I found immensely engrossing. It is my dream to one day travel far across and meet that beautiful city and witness the
grandness of its majestic cats, everywhere on sight. Speaking about the documentary itself, it narrates visually through the eyes of many felines that wander through the city freely, and we hear wonderful stories from its owners, or rather, the people who look after and care for them as they come and go willingly.It's compelling how all these people are connected to cats, and how they are a part of everyone's daily life, they can't imagine their lives without their existence. It sends a powerful message of union which intensifies the image of these magnificent creatures and also the people, because it is not all about cats, it's a charming combination of them plus the beautiful Istanbul and its marvelous, caring people.So, even if you are not a cat person, this documentary provides useful insight on what cats are really like, although I should tell you that there is absolutely
nothing like experiencing it for yourself, and building a connection with your cat companion, which is truly unique. Nevertheless this sort of helps you
understand them in a way. But there is a difference, because most cats in Instanbul live at liberty, that is not the case for me because I own two cats which live with me in my house, which I'm sure it is the case for many people across the world. So in more than one way, Istanbul is really a special place.Highly recommend Kedi, which is the Turkish word for ""cat"". Your welcome."
" Love this movie
",0.6369,0.992,2019-05-06 00:00:00,9,"This movie describes many feelings in our minds that we always have towards cats but were not able to describe in word. I love cats and I love them even more. I agree with a quote that people who do not love animals, they cannot anyone either. Cats also need love from human. We are doing the right thing not ignoring them. Every time stray cats look up at me and meowing at me, I feel like I have the luckiest moment in the world."
" The Cats Of Istanbul
",0.0,0.8847,2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,"This is a documentary not so much about cats themselves but about how the citizens of Istanbul interact with them. The cats in question are street cats brought in when they escape from incoming maritime traffic, and the people interviewed take care of them not as personal house pets, but as visiting wild animals, they way people in other places view pigeons.The movie focusses on several people who take care of these cats, including one who found that taking care of them helped him recover from a nervous breakdown. It also shows Istanbul as a city with many small, old-fashioned buildings, but with modern ones inevitably being built and threatening the old ways. No mention is made of people who dislike the cats or anyone who keeps them as actual house pets instead of strays to be taken care of, but that would spoil the movie's atmosphere. Interesting look at a piece of another culture."

Whoever you will hear speaking from the interviewees you will find yourself listening to a deeply philosophized yet simple quote you could keep to your heart for the rest of your life thus love and open heart create beautiful minds. Whenever you pause your screen you will find yourself in frond of nothing but beauty and you will catch yourself emotional or smiling or stunned or all of these together.

" For cat lovers.
",0.5267,0.9801,2018-02-27 00:00:00,7,"If you're an animal lover, and in this particular case a cat lover, there is no doubt you will like this documentary. It's well shot and the commentary of the people helping or having cats are obviously from people that love cats. I've always been doubtful about people that don't love animals, they are people I just can't trust. It's like they said at one point in this documentary ""If you don't love animals, you can't love a person either"". Turkey has obviously a lot of stray cats but here it shows that they're tolerated and loved. They bring joy to people's sometimes depressing lives. Every cat has a different character, like humans, and in this documentary it is well portraited. I saw already quite a bunch of Turkish movies, with a high rating, but I actually never saw a good one, ever. So this is the first Turkish production I did like. Can't get enough of those animal documentaries."
" Cats are worth their weight in gold
",0.2263,0.9816,2018-02-23 00:00:00,8,"2/22/18. If you love cats, then this one's for you! This documentary covers the lives of the street cats of Istanbul, Turkey. Amazingly, cats and humans can coexist, benefiting both in many ways. While these cats live in ""the wild"" of an urban area, they are not feral by any means, nor would you call them strays. Perhaps, community or free-roaming cats are probably the best definition of these cats. Unlike stray dogs, which you probably wouldn't want to make any contact with, these cats are open to human contact and know how to get free meals from anyone taken in by their charm. And, they do know how to charm. One benefit that was only touched upon lightly is rodent control. Perhaps New York City should think about adopting these street cats as a public health measure to control the burgeoning rat population! And, for being street cats, they were awfully clean-looking and approachable, and they know how to take care of their toilet needs discretely. So like cats! Worth catching."
" Unique

" A fine feline viewpoint
",0.2023,0.9907,2018-02-19 00:00:00,7,"This documentary pays tribute to the many stray cats of Istanbul as well as the humans who love them, take care of them, and are inspired by them.There is superb camera work that follows the felines in their daily adventures in the city. The cameras are always low and the camera people use clever devices that can keep up with the cats thus allowing the viewer to better see their activities some of which are fascinating.Even more inspiring are the interviews with the people who voluntarily help and observe the cats. Some find it therapeutic. Some are even spiritually inspired. One woman compares them to aliens from another planet with a different kind of intelligence. The interviewees, like the cats, come off as very likeable.There are about seven cats who each have a special segment in ""Kedi"". This is like the musical ""Cats"" in which each musical number told the story of one of its cat characters before moving on to the next one. While all creatures in this film (biped as well as quadriped) exude charm and warmth, interest wanes a little by the end. But it's still fun to watch the cats and humans connect so nicely. It helps one recall one's own favourite feline memories."
" Absolutely Beautiful
",0.6361,0.9946,2018-02-12 00:00:00,10,"Sometimes cute; sometimes funny; sometimes melancholic; sometimes philosophical, though always an accurate portrayal of our four legged friends; Kedi is a hidden gem. Regardless of your religion, race or culture, there is something there for everyone, and despite Istanbul being a city that is different in many ways, the themes and ideals explored are universal.Just like cats give us warmth, companionship and a sensation of being appreciated; this film accomplishes that same unique sensation. Focusing on the lives of seven cats, each with their own unique personality and characteristics, the documentary equally showcases how the people and the environments react to their presence. Those interviewed provide in-depth narration on their experiences, thoughts and feelings, which will truly remind you of human decency. It is nothing short of amazing.Though cats are occasionally tagged as lazy and ungrateful, with wild cats often viewed as a nuisance, this documentary shows the interesting lives these felines have. Every day, all of them have places to go and people to see, the feature giving us the time to pause, reflect, and notice how alike we are.The camerawork is fantastic, allowing us to track and follow all of the four legged friends which appear, from the winding alleyways, to the balconies which overlook the city streets, and the innumerable food stores, the camera going places you may never have thought of, to provide us an in-depth look into the lives of these many cats. The accompanying musical score is easy-going and memorable, like a catchy jingle, and really sets the tone. This is not a sombre documentary; it's a joyful one, though at the same time, reminds us to be mindful of how we treat the environment, lest these cats suffer.If I had any complaints about the documentary, it would be the length. As a proud lover of anything on four legs, the feature, which goes for just over an hour, felt more like a taste, than a main course, and it would have been great to see more of our seven friends, some of whom are provided more attention than others. That been said, from play-fighting through to territorial disputes; from jealousy through to adoration; from kittens to full grown adults; this documentary has it all."
" Wonderful!

I read a lot of the reviews here and one reviewer said it was about love. I agree with that. There are many things you could say this film is about. First and foremost it is about the connection the people have with these cats in this city. Most of these cats are wild. People feed them. There are a lot of caring people in the film that rescue them. People in the film express their personal stories about the cats or what they think of them. I just loved it. I highly recommend it if your a cat lover or an animal lover."

Even if you don't classify yourself as such, it will still hit its mark. All of the people interviewed and the stories they tell about the cats they've come to know are examples of humanity at its finest, and I'm so glad the film makers took the time to document them."
" very beautiful also: two types of documentaries

" A World of Cats
",0.0,0.9719,2017-11-21 00:00:00,8,"Istanbul is a city where cats seem to rule the streets. This documentary follows several of the furry felines as they navigate the neighborhood in search of food and affection from their human friends and caretakers. The people are secondary as the kitty's are the stars of the film. Their personalities are as unique as the men and women who help them make it through each day. The camera work is excellent, as many of the shots are from ground level and show the world from a cat's eye view. Kedi only runs a brief seventy nine minutes and I hope that it is one of the nominees for best documentary at this year's Academy Awards."
" Pretty Kedi
",0.4939,0.9705,2017-11-10 00:00:00,8,"Kedi is a must watch for all cat lovers. The culture of Istanbul and how cats are an integral part of it is astonishing. The humans speak frankly about how they love cats and how it affects their lives in a positive way. But through their words, it's the joy of sharing their love for cats that we see the most, cats are a significant part of their lives that keep them alive inside among all the chaos in the world. For some people, this new perspective would only be felt if they watch this film. There's some mesmerizing camera work throughout the film. The cat level shots, symmetric shots sometimes using mirrors and windows, the close-up shots of cats, the ariel shots etc and all this is in a documentary about street level cats. It must've been one hell of a job making this film. There are nine cats featured in here but they had shot much more than that. Ceyda Torun is definitely a talent to look out for in the future."

I was able to clearly see the love that so many people gave freely to these elegant, four-legged, furry creatures.TNR would be a wonderful option for such a huge over population that seems to be ongoing for these cats. I do dog rescue in the US and I wish that more people in the US would see this movie and view how so many of the cats of Turkey are cared for by the population of the country. What I encounter here in the US, for the most part, are people turning in cats that they have caught in cat traps. They set the traps in their yards and then ""proudly"" turn either someone's pet cat or a stray, into the animal pounds. When they are left there, for the most part, they have a very dismal future and end up being killed. There are not enough rescue organizations to help to save them, nor are there enough private adopters going to the shelter to adopt a new family pet. A disgusting state of affairs here in the US..."
" A dream doco for cat lovers
",0.6597,0.9973,2017-09-26 00:00:00,7,"First things first. If you don't like cats, avoid Kedi like the plague.There's more cats in Kedi than a Kibble convention and for those that don't feel a particular inkling towards our beloved feline friends, Kedi would be some form of torture.For the rest of us either passive cat fans or out and out crazy cat people, Kedi will be a delightful little treat as this lovable and easy to digest documentary that examines the life and times of various street cats that inhabit the landscape of Istanbul in Turkey is a no doubt slight but also thoroughly enjoyable documentation of the bond between humans and our ever aware paw clad friends.Director Ceyda Torun never looks to delve overly deep into any of the aspects of these cats lives but as we're introduced to the various hairy stars and the humans they have chosen to interact with (as well as the city of Istanbul itself), Kedi begins to showcase an understated yet reassuring look at the bond between humans and animals and how often these animal characters possess many of our human flaws, goodness's and personality traits.As Torun's camera prowls the hustling and bustling streets of Istanbul, sometimes from far above, sometimes from a cats point of few, we're introduced to the a cat that earns his keep by hunting rats, the cat that claws at the window of a café waiting for their food, a psychopathic cat that doubles up as an obsessive wife and a street wise cat the runs his neighbourhood as a dictator. They're but a few of the felines we are introduced to to go alongside our human figures.It's a lovely touch in the way that Kedi subtly brings in humans to the cat-centric tale, as these real-life figures from Istanbul become our narrators and storytellers of the history behind these cats and the way in which they've become a part of their worlds. The film may be somewhat aimless and sometimes even directionless but Torun clearly saw the need to just film and let things happen, giving Kedi a fresh and raw approach that remains engaging, even when saying or doing very little.Final say – A feel good cat-centred documentary that will be an unabashed joy for those many feline fans out there, Kedi may never climb or claw its way to any great heights but this is easily one of the year's most good natured and easy to digest true life tales, that will more than likely encourage cat ownership for the most stone hearted of feline naysayers.3 ½ rat exterminators out of 5"

" By cat lovers about cat lovers for cat lovers
",0.8807,0.9881,2017-08-11 00:00:00,6,"""Kedi"" or ""Nine Lives: Cats in Istanbul"" is a Turkish/American co-production in the Turkish language and the probably most known work by director Ceyda Torun. This award-winning film is relatively short as it stays below the 80-minute mark. And the focus here is on cats, namely stray cats in Istanbul and I found out there are quite a lot of them. But other than that and the director's nationality I am not really sure why they picked Istanbul. Anyway, we get to see many cats and their interactions with rats, dogs each other and humans obviously. Here and there the film also uses cats to elaborate a bit on the city of Istanbul, for example in terms of women's emancipation, plans about building new houses and here and there you may also see an Erdogan reference. But it is all about the cats nonetheless. The good thing is you get to see them from start to finish and it is impossible not to find them beautiful, especially when we see mothers with kittens. The bad news is that the film loses itself at time in just displaying nothing but cats and even id they included many people with a connection to these felines, it is not always working out. So I guess it was a good decision to keep the movie this short. The stories about the cats were interesting and entertaining, but nothing really groundbreaking. I bet there are thousands of cats out there keeping rats away from restaurants for example. But I still liked the watch as a whole and I probably ""only"" like cats. Cannot say I love them as I never owned a cat as a pet in my life (or the other way around as some might say), so those who really love cats will maybe enjoy the hell out of this movie and consider it one of their favorite films of the year. It's a pretty simple documentary, but still charming at times too. Yes the moments when they tried to make a connection between human happiness and feline happiness are a bit random, maybe even pretentious, but just don't take the film seriously. Maybe a bit of the cat action was scripted too. Who knows. Still worth seeing. Thumbs-up from me."
" A delightful movie set in a delightful city
",0.8225,0.9938,2017-08-03 00:00:00,10,"As one who loves both Istanbul and cats, I looked forward to seeing this movie. I was not disappointed. Istanbul is depicted in all its cosmopolitan beauty...but the cats are the stars of the show.Istanbul has an abundance of stray cats, but the Turkish people care for them by providing food and shelter and (in many cases) affection and company. It's not a city for cat phobics, nor is this movie suitable for people who don't like cats. But, if you do, it's a delight. The cats' unique personalities shine through, as the movie takes you to various neighborhoods to show their daily routines. The camera aims about 8 inches off the ground, so you really feel like a cat following the stars through their activities. We see affectionate cats, dignified cats, vulnerable cats, resourceful and acrobatic cats, tough cats, artistic cats. And, in between, we hear from the people who love them. We learn something about how these cats fit into their life philosophy, and why some of them go to great lengths to help them survive and thrive.It's a beautiful look at a unique culture and its feline residents. If you can get to Istanbul, it's worth the effort ten times over. But, even if you can't, this little gem will give you an interesting look into the city and its occupants, both feline and human."
" Heartful glimpse into the world that you may have missed in Istanbul
",-0.296,0.9918,2017-08-01 00:00:00,7,"Video sites are the brave new world of movie and series and other similar content producing, snatching awards and offering the freshness and quality the mainstream American cinema can only dream about. Following Amazon, Netflix, and others, YouTube has hopped on that train too, with similarly impressive results. ""Kedi"" is not actually produced with YouTube's money, but they bought all the streaming rights for YouTube Red. And now it's in our cinemas too. Kedi"" (cat"" in Turkish) is a 79-minute documentary about street cats of Istanbul. There's a lot of them around, and many people love and take care of them. What results is a heartful glimpse into the world that you may have missed even if you've been to Istanbul. If you don't care about cats, or have watched too many animal videos online already, ""Kedi"" is probably not worth your time. But for ardent cat fans such as I, watching it is a pretty good way to celebrate the existence of those magical animals all over again. ""Kedi"" is well made and put together, if not exactly spectacular in any way. If you like cats, try it out."
" This is everything a cat lover needs
",0.5859,0.9518,2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"This documentary is beautiful, funny and magical. I'm a strong candidate for ""crazy cat lady"" to be honest, because I simply love cats and this film gives the exact reasons why I do so passionately. The shots of Istanbul are over the top gorgeous and we get to know different sets and POVs of the city. As another viewer already said, if you don't like cats, you probably will miss most of the enchantment of this piece since, well, it's all about them. But you kind of like cats, you'll most likely start to see them differently or at least learn another perspective. And at last, if you do love them - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"
" Not Just for cat lovers
",0.5267,0.98,2017-07-21 00:00:00,10,This movie made me fall in love with my cats again. The beautiful cinematography and the limited story line was a treat to watch. I have always admired Turkey and after watching this I want to be there as quick as possible. Cat lovers are special people and we can see so many sweet people in there. I smiled so much looking at them with tears in my eyes. Thank you for this.
" Cats as part of the culture of an unknown country
",0.0,0.9816,2017-06-26 00:00:00,10,"There are movies out there for all types of people, old, young, romantic, sci-fi, but until now, nothing for cat-lovers. This is so popular in Sydney that I could not get a seat for the first 2 times I wanted to book in. The 3rd session, the next day in the afternoon, was full house, about 40 women and 5 men. Yep, that's the cat lover ratio. Istanbul is a city between East and West, and we see it as a fish eating busy and prosperous city, crowded with humans and cats. The people are just as charming as the cats. The cats eat well and have homes constructed from polystyrene boxes. There are the cat crazy humans and the crazy cats, polite humans and polite cats. This wonderfully shot, from the cat's eye view, documentary is a must see sleeper hit."
" Thin documentary for cat fanatics only
",0.0,0.8881,2017-06-13 00:00:00,6,"Istanbul is a port city and the cats that used to travel with the sailors hundreds of years ago would disembark thinking they had made their final destination, only to be left behind when the ship they had been travelling on left without them. This left generations of cats to make their home in Istanbul where they live semi-domesticated lives adopting humans who feel lucky to be able to feed them and pay their vet bills in exchange for the companionship these cats give them. Kedi (which means cat in Turkish) is about a small cluster of these cat/human pairings. We follow individual cats and learn about their personalities and about the people who take care of them but unfortunately even though the interview subjects hint at interesting stories or beliefs tied to why they feel such an infinity towards cats it's never explained in great depth and the subjects aren't given much time to explain themselves. Similarly while everyone is full of affection for the cats and their personalities we barely get to see much of them interacting or acting out before it's on to the next subject. And honestly I really love cats and had heard so many great things about this doc but at one point I almost fell asleep because the film was becoming so repetitive. Buried in the back their are so many interesting things being discussed, specifically about how gentrification and the ubanization of Istanbul means that these feline friends will be abandoned or imperilled, but again the treatment given is so service that these issues are barely discussed."
" Being a cat lover, I definitely enjoyed it.
",0.8689,0.9933,2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"'KEDI': Four Stars (Out of Five)A Turkish documentary about the thousands of stray cats that live on the streets of Istanbul, and how they effect the community there. The movie was directed by Ceyda Torun, a Turkish-born filmmaker that now works out of the US, and it was produced by Torun and Charlie Wuppermann. The film has received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's been performing really well at indie theaters (including my local theater, here in Corvallis, Oregon). Being a cat lover, I definitely enjoyed it.In Turkey, thousands of cats have lived on the streets of Istanbul (the largest city there) for centuries. Some of those cats are cared for, and deeply loved, by the people there. This film focuses on seven cats in particular; Sari, Duman, Bengu, Aslan, Parcasi, Gamsiz, Psikopat and Deniz. The film crew followed these cats around, while continuously filming them at street level. The crew also interviewed several people that interact with these felines.I think anyone that loves cats, or animals in general, will enjoy this movie. It does seem a bit long and slow-paced (even though it's only 80 minutes long), but the visuals are always beautiful to watch. The film is also pretty insightful, about how the cats deeply effect the people living in the community there. It's another great argument for why everyone needs to go vegan! Still, it would have been a lot better, and more effective, as a 20 to 30 minute short film. As it is, it kind of feels like a feature length YouTube cat video. It's more insightful than that, but still the cat videos that go on for too long can always benefit from better editing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/K3Maw4akm_o"
" A Cat's-Eye View of a Remarkable City
",0.5574,0.9917,2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"You forget Turkey's difficult politics watching this documentary by Turkish filmmaker Ceyda Torun and cinematographer Charlie Wuppermann about Istanbul's Big Romance with—cats! (What did you think ""Kedi"" means?) At an hour twenty-minutes, the film is somewhat longer than it might be, but as a vacation from the news cycle, perhaps not long enough. The residents of Istanbul don't ""own"" most of the cats that roam their streets and markets, that nest in quiet places and makeshift hideaways. But they more than tolerate them, they celebrate them. And the cats, meanwhile, act like ""slumming royals,"" says Joe Leydon in Variety. You can see the cast here. A number of the featured felines rule the neighborhoods where they live, defending their turf against interlopers and providing benefits to the humans. ""They absorb my negative energy,"" one man says. A waterside restaurant owner who'd had a problem with ""mice"" (I fear this was a euphemism) celebrated the day ""this lion took up residence."" She takes care of the ""mice,"" to the comfort of the diners, I'm sure. My particular favorite was the cat who lives at a deli. She never goes inside, but paws at the window—rather insistently, it should be noted—when she wants one of the countermen to make her a snack. The filmmakers identified a number of the city's human residents whose mission seems to be to keep these felines in food. One pair of women cooks twenty pounds of chicken a day for them. (!) ""All of us have tabs with all the vets,"" says a bakery owner, and we see a man take an injured kitten to the vet in a taxi.. In short, the film is charming. It talks about how cats are different than dogs. And it shows how caring for the cats has been helpful to people in many ways. Suitable for all ages, and especially for those who have—or wish they had—been to Istanbul and now are reluctant to go because of paragraph one above. As Leydon says, it's ""splendidly graceful and quietly magical."""
" Cats and the People Who Feed Them
",0.0,0.3818,2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"This movie is footage of stray cats in Istanbul and the people who feed them. There is no narration and no context. It's cats and the people who feed them. There is some variety in the fact that some of the cats are tabbies, some calicos, some black and white. Some of the people are men and some are women, some are fishermen, some are shopkeepers and some are restaurateurs. What we learn about these people is that they feed cats. We don't learn how many stray cats there are in Istanbul nor do we learn about any government policies concerning them. This is footage of cats and the people who feed them. I did find a few of the people's comments about stray cats to be interesting in that they offered a subtle critique of people who keep cats exclusively indoors as ""owners"" of these cats. This was a worthwhile point and I enjoyed this movie for about 45 minutes. Unfortunately it went on for another 35 minutes and I had seen more than enough cats by then."
" Kedi beautiful and sweet film
",0.7845,0.996,2017-04-03 00:00:00,10,Uplifting story about the cats of Istanbul and the kind people who care for them and love them. Incredible cinematography beautifully photographed. The city of Istanbul looks both beautiful and mysterious. After seeing this film you will want to consider a trip to this fascinating ancient city. As no other film has done you will experience the incredible lives of these animals How they survive take care of their young and still remain playful happy an adventurous. One of the best documentaries I have ever seen. A film that you will not forget. This really is a captivating gentle film about the special bond between very decent people and these interesting animals that interact with them daily. It reminds us that a cat looking up at us is one of those moments how sweet life really is and that we should appreciate these moments that remind us that were alive.Ceyda Torun the director has given us a great cat's eye view of their lives haunts travels and more importantly the personalities. But she gives us a glimpse of the every day people and how caring for these animals has brightened their lives. The 7 cats are all quite distinctive and memorable. A special thanks to Kira Fontana for a beautiful sound track that enhances this film with Turkish and world music that must be made available. To all involved with the production of this film you have done a great job. This film has been very well received.
" Sweet, but ultimately sad
",-0.4854,0.7182,2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"This is a lovely but highly romanticized documentary about stray cats in Istanbul and the people who are doing their best to care for them. And I could just leave it at that.Unfortunately, when one knows better, one can't love a documentary that makes no mention at all of spay/neuter for street animals. All I could think of were the neglected animals which weren't shown in the movie (which anyone who has traveled in a non- first world country knows are there). I managed to catch a glimpse of only one cat with a clipped ear tip (the universal sign of a sterilized street animal), so, in the end, I found the movie sad. Feeding street animals without sterilizing them only increases their ability to reproduce and, while well meaning, is incredibly irresponsible. The filmmakers owed it to the cats to at least ask the question or make some mention of this.Instead they focused on the pretty side of an essentially bad situation."
" Perfect film for all cat lovers out there!
",0.8122,0.9619,2017-03-23 00:00:00,10,"if you love cats, and admire/respect people who love cats, you will love this film.Kedi focuses on a half a dozen or so cats and their primary human caretakers. Each cat has their own very unique personality put on them by their caretakers. These individuals who take their of these people are very respectable, humble people. You will really admire how much these cats mean to them. They take on a very philosophical, down-to-earth, often religious approach to why they care for these stray cats. For most of these people, these cats have improved their lives and given them a better respect/appreciation towards life in general. It's very touching.There are also many scenes of of the city, showing random stray cats going about their lives, the cinematography and camera-work showing of the city is really great. These are a few brief scenes where you don't see any cats at all, just the people of Istanbul going about their daily lives.Does this film ever get depressing you may ask? Well, there is one sad scene in the film, but it is also one of those moments that you just have to accept as being a fact of life for these stray cats. There are also a couple scenes where you see swarms of cats waiting to be fed by their people, or scenes of litters of kittens living in dirty, clearly not ideal living conditions, and it makes you wish the city had some sort of TNR program to deal with the population of all these cats, but again, it's just one of those things you have to accept.Kedi is a all around feel-good film. But it did make me wonder when it was all filmed, considering the political turmoil currently going on in Turkey. It made me wonder how the people shown in the film and their cats are doing, if their lives have been negatively affected by all the chaos. I would certainly hope that is not the case.If you can still catch this film at your local theater that shows independent/art-house films, it is worth seeing for sure. Otherwise rent it or buy the DVD when it is released then."
" Kedi
",0.0,0.9607,2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Yesterday I saw ""Nine Lives: Cats in Istanbul."" It's a movie about the many unowned cats and the people of Istanbul who love and tend them. Though there are a few beautiful scenes of the whole city, most are shot from about two feet above the ground. Unless you are as short as I am, after awhile the film may make you feel slightly claustrophobic.I'm glad I saw the movie. I learned a lot about the personality of the cats and the people in Istanbul who care for them: The people speak Turkish, so if you can't speak Turkish and can't read English subtitles you're out of luck. Some of the cats speak too, but there aren't any subtitles explaining what they're saying, so, unless you speak Cat, or can intuit what they're saying, you're out of luck there too. Each of both have unique characteristics. Some of the humans have one special cat they feed and interact with, while others tend many and have many followers. The same goes for the cats. Some of the cats have kittens and, though they may have been lazy before giving birth, they're pretty protective after, and they spend a lot more time looking for food. One of the female cats seemed to be worried about other females having an affair with her mate. She chased any that came near him away. For all I know, the same may have been true of some of the people, though the movie didn't delve into that.My girlfriend refused to see the film because she was afraid it was going to be violent. Well, if you are a Rambo movie fan it's probably not a film you'd care to see. A couple of times the cats have a hissy fit, but nothing much comes of it. There is one scene where a guy picks up what seems to be a dead kitten. He holds its limp head in his hand and speculates it may have fallen and be dead--it certainly looked dead to me--but he hops in a cab and takes it to a vet. I can't say I'm too clear why he did that if the cat was really dead, since there were a lot of trash cans readily available. There's also a scene where a cat stalks a rat. Based on the number of cats in the city, it must have been a really smart rat. Fortunately for non-Rambo fans, the cat didn't catch it. I'm not sure why it would even try. The people of Istanbul feed the cats, and the cats live very well."

See this; you will NOT be disappointed. Cinephotography stunning. People and cats both sad and sweet, poignant, with high emotional impact. Hope I can find the music. I love world music, instruments. The music alone makes it worth seeing. A mix of traditional music, a little jazz, no syrupy pop music. Kedi will keep your attention riveted. Cannot recommend any higher than 10 out of 10."

" ""Without the cats, Istanbul would lose part of its soul""
",-0.4019,0.9967,2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"""Kedi"" (2016 release from Turkey; 80 min.) is a documentary about the thousands of stray cats (street cats) all over Istanbul. As the movie opens, we get a fabulous aerial view of the city, and then get to know a number of cats, starting with a female cat who is out hunting food on the streets, not for herself but as it turns out for her small kittens who are anxiously waiting her return. And that's just the start of this...Couple of comments: if you don't care for cats, then by all means do yourself a favor and seek out another movie. If on the other hand you love cats, you are in for an absolutely delightful treat. Apparently as we learn in this film, Istanbul, itself a huge metropolis, is home to many street cats, and the city's population (at least for the most part) has taken upon itself to care for these cats, and to outright love them. The movie focuses on a handful of cats, all of them with their own personality (the ""fish thief"", the ""carefree"", the ""flirt"", etc.). A number of shots are filmed from the cat's perspective (i.e. close to ground level). Along the way, we get a fabulous look of what day-to-day life in Istanbul is like. At one point a woman comments ""it is difficult for women to express their femininity in this country, but the cats do it so gracefully"", a dig as to the social environment for women in Turkey, even in a cosmopolitan city like Istanbul. But in the end, it's all about the cats: they hunt, they play, they roam the streets, they fight, they climb, and along the way they steal your heart.I had heard a glowing review of ""Kedi"" on NPR a week or two ago and when ""Kedi"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening where I saw this at was PACKED, much to my surprise, and the audience absolutely LOVED the movie, laughing out loud many times throughout the movie. After the movie was over, I couldn't wait to get home, where I knew my beloved cat Mimic would be waiting for me ;-) If you love cats, you don't want to miss this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Kedi"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Go see it!"
