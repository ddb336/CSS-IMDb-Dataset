",0.4767,0.9293,2021-03-14 00:00:00,10,"This film is full of life; it's inspiring and has pierced through my heart. What I love about this film even more is the breathtaking location, Maudie's paintings, and raw emotions portrayed beautifully. The main character's story reminds me that despite the challenges and misfortunes we have in life, we should keep going for it will be fruitful - our purpose and that we can find a place where we could call home."
" Must see movie!
",0.0,0.92,2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,Hawkes and Hawkins were soo unbelievably great in this movie! You felt like you walked into their lives it wasnt just a movie!! Love the storyline and awesome acting!! I do enjoyed this movie for the second time!
" one of the best biographical films you're going to watch
",0.6369,0.9922,2021-01-10 00:00:00,9,"It's known by fact that Maud suffered from a serious disease called rheumatoid arthritis, and by that you can tell that it's going to be a really hard work for someone to actually portray her in a movie, well but I guess they found the perfect actress for this role and she's Sally Hawkins.
And of course the direction makes an excellent job capturing the struggle that is like to live with such a disesase.I could easily say this was her best performance so far, I mean she did a great job on ""Shape of Water"" (which she got a nomination the same year Maudie came out, but unfortunately she could only get one nomination per categorie).Despite Sally's acting is so great, she's not alone here, Ethan Hawke does a really good job on this unusual role for him.This movie has so many great aspects, it's really a shame it wasn't recognized by the Oscars, you could argue that it kind of uses that sort of formula for biographical movies and it's not much different from like ""Coal Miner's Daughter"". This is a very unique story about this very unique artist and I think it deserves a lot more.You should really give this movie a watch, even if you have no idea who Maud Lewis is, the story here is just really inspiring and beautiful.I'm giving this a 9,5/10have you seen this film? what did you think of it?"

" Sally Hawkins can do no wrong; Ethan Hawke's pretty good too
",0.2023,0.9965,2020-12-23 00:00:00,9,"Maudie (2016) is a Canadian-Irish film that was directed by Aisling Walsh. It takes place in Nova Scotia.Sally Hawkins portrays Maud, who suffers from severe arthritis. She lives with her hostile, domineering aunt until she decides to somehow free herself. The way she does this is to become housekeeper to Everett Lewis (Ethan Hawke). Lewis is not the kindly sort--he doesn't like many people, and they don't like him.He lives in a tiny house near a village in Nova Scotia. He makes a marginal living by selling fish, firewood, and whatever can bring in a few dollars.Maud and Everett are an unlikely couple, but, as outcasts, they are drawn together. As it turns out, Maude has an eye for color, and she begins to paint simple pictures that are truly wonderful. Soon, people want to buy them.There actually was a woman named Maude Lewis (1903 -1970) and she was, indeed, a respected folk artist. I can't say how close the movie comes to portraying her life, but the basics are accurate.This is really a two-actor show. That can be good news or bad news depending on the actors. Sally Hawkins is one of the great actors of our century. She can do Shakespeare (Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester in Henry VI), she can do comedy (Poppy), she can do drama (Elisa Esposito in The Shape of Water.) She brings life to the character of Maud. (Incidentally, she can carry off an American or Canadian accent perfectly.)Ethan Hawke shines in his portrayal of Everett Lewis. Hawke isn't just a foil for Hawkins' brilliance. He holds his own in the film, and the chemistry between the two is obvious.This film played at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre, and I wish I had seen it there. The beautiful Nova Scotian scenery would have been wonderful to watch on the large screen. However, the DVD version was certainly acceptable.Maudie is certainly worth seeking out and watching. It has a very strong IMDb rating of 7.6. I thought it was even better than that, and rated it 9."
" Dynamite Comes in Small Packages
",0.1779,0.9308,2020-11-16 00:00:00,10,"""Maudie,"" (2026). Starring Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawkes. Directed by Aisling Walsh. Written by Sherry White. This film is a biopic of a woman named Maud Lewis, who despite her arthritic disability managed to become a prolific painter. She had several talents actually and a profound sense of self, along with keen intuition and a sharp eye. Maud did not limit herself and endured whatever she had to endure, yet she was able to maintain her personal boundaries at the same time sustaining many blows, including the physical, psychological, and emotional ones despite not being able to defend herself. You cannot see this movie without being impressed with this tiny little woman's spirit.
Her paintings reflect her vision of her little town, Marshalltown, NS. She became internationally famous.
The acting, direction, cinematography, art production were all excellent. I give this film 5 of 5 stars. It's on Amazon Prime's Starz channel. Enjoy!"

Oh man, what a beautiful piece of cinema with mesmerising performances and cinematography. These two, Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke were so incredibly great that, they just took me into their world and made me a part of it. People complaining about Everette being rude to Maud, as they could not tolerate it and yeah, agree he was , but that's how the life is and I didn't find any fault because when those two enjoying their life by comforting each other whenever needed barring Everette outburst, I don't think I have to take a dig.The best example, when Maud asks Everette to get a screen door , Everette refuses to do so but you know what happens eventually, thats the beauty of their relation and they don't even exchange words even after Everette fixing the door, but it brought a smile on Maud's face. I consider it as most precious one.Sally Hawkins was top notch , flawless and got everything right from the word go. Especially in one scene where she gets down the car to see something for the first time and she literally made me shed tears with her act. Coming to Ethan, I quoted in the 2nd paragraph that people didn't like the way he treated Maud , but I take it as a big achievement and compliment for Ethan. He made people to have opinions , I guess that's more than enough and he was spotless.MUST WATCH!!"

I'm either going senile or this is the best movie I've seen yet.The subtle way the storyline is developed amid emotions of tension & tenderness, brutality & betrayal, kindness and compassion. Acting just takes your breath away and the strength in some of those scenes. No words necessary - the visuals captured it all.Based on a true story with English & American protagonists and an Irish director - how can it not be good!"

",0.8934,0.9908,2019-12-20 00:00:00,8,"At first the movie was slow and i didn't know what to expect. But then I got into the endearing story line. I loved Maude and all she went through. She is the definition of perseverance.I don't understand why she moved out of her aunt's beautiful house to live with some grunting tyrant? I get she wanted something of her own, but he always made it very clear that it was HIS house. She at first was like a slave. I loved Ethan Hawke in this but his character was horrible to her compared to the aunt. But it was a wonderful surprise to find out this was a true story and that you can see the house where she painted in a museum in nova scotia. Her paintings are so beautiful. They may seem simple but when you look at them, you can feel the pain and sadness within the pictures. But also the beauty and love. Also loved how this movie was filmed in the maritimes. More movies should be filmed there. Only thing I just plain hated was the title. How many people are going to want to give a movie called, Maudie a try? No one even called her that. It should have been called 'The Painted House.'"

",0.0,0.9937,2019-08-04 00:00:00,8,"What an amazing little film. Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke soar. They own the film. This is a wonderful heartwarming story of two people in rural Nova Scotia who in their own way overcome poverty to find true happiness. Oh it had its bumps and bruises and Maudie (Hawkins) does suffer in the early going at the hands of Everett (Hawke). Maudie is crippled with arthritis and she really does smoke too much but she has a special talent in her ability to see the beauty of things despite what she goes through. Everett also finds himself through his rough hewn ways and grows to love Maudie. This is a stunningly beautiful film, filmed in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. The land and the sea help ease the poverty of the region and the small minded pettiness of the towns people. Maudie because of her afflictions is constantly taken advantage of but she escapes to find herself and forge her life with Everett even as he abused her. A worthy winner at the Canadian Screen Awards including actor, actress, picture and director."

" A world without shadows
",0.0,0.995,2019-06-27 00:00:00,10,"MAUDIE (2016)Two years ago a friend of mine raved about this movie, Maudie; she loved it and said that knowing me, I would too. I watched a preview and mistakenly thought it looked like a Hallmark movie, which is not the kind of film I was after. Well, I was wrong; Maudie is not an overly sentimental Hallmark-type movie; it's genuinely touching, wonderfully cast and acted, and unburdened by a maniplulative script or cloying direction, but rather, it's a strong, delicate story based on the life of Nova Scotian folk artist Maud Lewis.Maud was born bent, and suffered from severe arthritis; Sally Hawkins delighfully captured the physical and character traits of this vulnerable, creative, fiesty, persevering, and forthright woman as she finds independence from her emotionally abusive family by answering an ad, ""live-in or keep house,"" for a bachelor in his forties.The homeowner is a poor, struggling recluse, Everett Lewis, played beautifully by Ethan Hawke. Everett was so unlikeable at times, the only thing that kept me open to his relationship with Maud is that Ethan's portrayal hit a finessed balance of Everett's onerous nature with his hidden human side that was unfoldng under Maud's simple spell. Juxtiposed with Everett's harshness is the fact that Sally's Maud exudes self confidence, joy, the ability to speak up for herself, and to follow her passion for painting. As an artist myself, I reveled in watching Maud blissfully paint her bright, happy pictures all over the walls, furniture, wooden boards, and cards; I know this feeling and have done it a bit myself. Beginning with one kind patron, Maude's small paintings become sought after and she achieves a degree of artistic notoriety in her life.Everyone did their job well in this production: casting, location scouts, (the scenery is gorgeous), hair and makeup, music, editing, set design, and so on. Bringing Everett around to those times where he embodies hs love for his wife were moments so hard won that they gift the audience with some heartfelt heft. This lovely, artistic, character study will not be for everyone, but it was for me... to the tune of ten stars."
" Bored by Maude
",-0.2732,0.9837,2019-06-02 00:00:00,1,"When I first started watching Maudie I had no idea she was an actual person so for the first 10 minutes or so I thought this was a fictional story about an ungrateful woman, her brother who acts like no human I have encountered, and a long suffering Aunt, who the brother seems to hold some sort of mysterious power over. One moment this woman is hysterical because the brother has sold the house, the next she is mysteriously in a nightclub, as of course were common in that hotbed of the jazz age, Digby, Nova Scotia. By now I am rolling my eyes at the ridiculousness and the sheer black and white and lack of nuance of every scene. The brother and Aunt are evidently BAD and we can only assume, although as yet we have no idea who this woman is, where she came from and what she might possibly contribute in the future, we must assume she is a heroine of some sort in the making. Lapsing into profound boredom I consulted Mr Google and found ""Maudie"" is/was an actual person who is famous in in her home town for painting kitsch pictures of cats and other things that are dignified by the title of ""folk art"". Well what to think now. I ask myself, am I actually interested in this achievement? Well, kudos to her I guess for achieving what she did, but no, not really, I'm not. Am I actually interested in the road it took to make these achievements possible? On the basis of the movie so far the road seems to be an extremely boring one populated by a woman of no particular warmth who seems to make very stupid decisions. We know absolutely nothing about this woman. She may have been at her Aunts for a week or all her life, we have no idea. We don't know why she couldn't have stayed with her Aunt and painted pretty pictures there and lived happily ever after. She appears to have some sort of disability, but we have no idea what it is. Is this disability, whatever it is, sufficient for us to root for her on that basis alone and watch in awe as she overcomes it to become ""famous""? Would she have become famous if she did not have this disability?Why are we making a movie about this particular artist instead of the thousands of other possibilities?And of course hanging over all this like a dark cloud is the fundamental question as to whether ANY historical person or event should be documented by anything but a documentary. Anyone who has read any of my other reviews of movies based on historical events or people (""Sunshine and Oranges"", ""Hachiko"", ""Saving Mr Banks"", to name a few) will already know my answer to this question. Judging from other reviews many people have intensely enjoyed ""Maudie"" and for that I am thankful and somewhat in awe for I wish that I too could enter a world where fantasy is perceived to be real. For in the final analysis ""Maudie"" IS pure fantasy. NOONE in this movie said, or did, ANYTHING that occurs in this movie. Not a single sentence, phrase or solitary word in this movie was ever said by Maudie or her chums. We know she existed, we know she had a disability of some sort, we know she had a hard time (like most of the rest of the World) we know she painted, we know these paintings became popular. Maybe we have quotes of things she might have said in later life, I don't know and am not interested enough to find out. But fundamentally, like all of these ""biographical"" movies it is all a mess of a screenwriter's imagination to provide enough tension and tear jerks to sell tickets and win awards. That is it.
Sorry but I did not make it past 30 minutes. I gave up at the ridiculous scene where the rich New Yorker knocks on the door of Maudie's hovel (as rich people are wont to do) and threatens to take all her fish business away (what is she, a fish magnate?). She sees what appears to be the work of a blind 5 year old let loose with a paintbrush on the wall, and my heart sinks even further as I see the road of discovery stretch relentlessly and monotonously ahead. I see the triumphs, the heartbreak, the wetting of hankies...argh, it is all too much... Click. Goodbye Maudie and good luck."
" Ok movie, bad script and acting
",-0.3182,-0.9803,2019-06-01 00:00:00,5,"I am not sure if it is me, but I find the script and dialogues a bit basic, almost as if the actors run out of things to say or they are badly improvising. The acting is badly exaggerated, weak, unconvincing and somehow slightly embarrassing.
Over all a bad Hollywood attempt to make a European style quality movie. I guess it is down to bad directing too. But then again the critics seem to like it."
" Quietly Brilliant
",0.5859,0.9875,2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,"This is a beautifully produced story of a woman with a loving soul and a talent to match her heart. Her story seems simple on the surface, but there is a lot of depth to her character and her life. Sally Hawkins is simply amazing in her role as Maudie, and Ethan Hawke handled his character perfectly. He is not a man easily liked, but in the end you do feel you can understand him, thanks to Ethan's subtle performance. An added bonus comes at the end during the roll of credits. We are treated to views of many of the paintings Maud created, and they are absolutely beautiful. Two thumbs up for this one."

I really love the contrast between cold, mirthless scenery and Maudie's cute and colorful paintings.Maudie herself was a modest, happy and such a positive person, even when life wasn't easy on her and nobody had any faith in her. Despite everything, she kept going and didn't let anything bring her down! Now who wouldn't love a character like her?Overall, a really awesome movie, made me cry like 32 times.

I'll get back to that.I watched this in my ""Movies from 2016"" week. And that was basically what I knew before starting. In the start of the movie, everything was very dark. I might just have a bad TV, but for me it was to dark. And that's the negative I can say about this movie. I understand why you wouldn't love or like this movie. It's a little slow going, nothing really happens. It's just a good story. It's quite hard to set anything on the characters, since it's based on real people. I don't knoe so much about the real story, but from what I know, it's actually the true story that gets told. I HATE those movies, that is ""based on a real story"", that only got like a second of the real story. This happens in horror stories.BUT, I loved them both. In the start, where Everett slapped Maud, I HATED Everett. He is a bad person, he is always angry, he won't even pay Maud. But I got to love him. The best was actually, that he didn't just became some happy guy. He was still angry, he still didn't talk so much, he was still Everett.And the ending.. It's a movie about Maud Lewis life, and the ending is the ending of her life. That's the right ending, but how Everett acted was the best. She was gone, so he HAD to keep the paintings. Perfect!"
" Sensitive but not sentimental, hard but not harsh, sweet but not cloying

But if that word has any meaning, you will find it by watching this precious movie.
Sensitive but not sentimental, hard but not harsh, sweet but not cloying, beautifully directed, shot, and musicalized.
I've been reluctant to watch movies with Sally Hawkins from the moment I saw ""Happy-go-lucky"" (Mike Leagh). Now, I have to say, I will look for more feature films which her. She's done a wonderful work in ""Maudie."" And so did Ethan Hawk. The fact that the real people they portray were much older when the film narration ends doesn't matter at all.

",0.0,0.6249,2018-07-23 00:00:00,10,"When I walked out of the theatre with my two friends, my first comment was why can't Americans make good films like this? I have become so disgusted with about 96% of contemporary American films that I won't to to a theatre. This films the opposite (Yes, I know that kids won't like Maudie). Almost all of the positive user reviews capture what I feel. I do note that the fact the film does not tell us that her parents had died. What her brother did is in the film.The film tells that she had a daughter. It does not tell that her daughter was born out of wedlock and that her partner abandoned her and her baby. I feel this is just a tiny bit that comprehensively adds to the story. I don't understand why I have to go to film society presentations to see good films like this, but going to film society presentation is a much more pleasant than contemporary complexes."

First there is French Canadian cinema which produces films in the French language (and some in the English language) and like its counter parts in Europe, Asia, etc., come up with engaging, excellent and in many cases masterpieces. Then there the one which is linked more to the American film industry and Hollywood which nowadays appear to produce a lot of trash.
Maudie, Aisling Walsh's biopic of Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis, admittedly someone I had never heard of, pertains to the latter. Sally Hawkins was ok as the apparently humble Maud, while Ethan Hawk made a very good obnoxious Everett, but the entire film was very weak because none of the characters had much to say. There was nothing about what inspired Lewis, what makes her tick, in fact the whole film was totally devoid of any type of character study that should have featured in a work of this subject. To be honest, there was not anything much we haven't seen or heard in the average Hollywood fare. I fell that Director Walsh missed out on a great opportunity to make a poetic and philosophical movie. By using well-known actors instead of unfamiliar ones and exploring the subject instead of analysing it only goes to show that the producers were only interested in getting bums on seats, enticing people to go to the cinema believing they are getting a good film. They are not."

" Maudie - A Special Subject In A Difficult Frame
",0.0516,0.9901,2018-05-14 00:00:00,9,"I'm sometimes asked why I look at various movies without having heard of them before - Maudie is the personification of the very reason. Every so often you find something that leaves you almost speechless, something that changes a part of the way you think and see the world. Maud's story is entirely watchable - even though at times, it's not an easy watch - some people have such difficult lives but they simply keep on going against the odds. This one features powerful performances, beautiful location cinematography (Guy Godfree) & a warm, evocative music score, all showcased within a sensitive script by Sherry White & crowned by the effective directorial touches of Aisling Walsh. The Newfoundland setting (standing in for Nova Scotia for several production reasons) is alternately serene and inhospitable - with both elements adding to the challenged existence of Maudie (superbly played by Sally Hawkins) as she battles her afflictions and the socially inept personality of her unlikely partner/husband Everett Lewis (well portrayed by Ethan Hawk). Maudie is a must watch film for lovers of rich character studies about real-life battlers. Action blockbuster fans may find themselves being challenged but, If you don't shed the odd tear for Maud then you may have lost a vital part of your humanity. It's also very moving to see a clip from an old B/W short showing the real life Maud and Everett featured amongst the end credits. Try not to miss this Irish/Canadian production"

I was more and more enraptured with the two actors as the movie went on. It has subtle interwoven themes - overcoming obstacles, doing what you love, being happy with what you have. This is both gritty and romantic. It has a warmth that is sadly lacking in many films today. In many ways it is a striking and original film.

A tiny house, four walls, poorly made furniture, simple food, one bed, candle lights.... even after Maud starting selling her works and made money, they did not expanded the house or got a better car(in the film), because they were satisfied with each other and their little house. We don't need that much to be happy. Just like our fathers and mothers always say, they were much happier than us at our age. They had no internet, TVs, airplanes.... but they had much more real fun back then. It all make perfect sense now, we wanted too much and this desire grows bigger and the list of things we want is getting longer and longer, but it does not bring us the simple happiness, the fulfillment of living a life. This is a uplifting movie that make you think if Maud can make it and achieved happiness in her life, what is the reason for you to not have it?!

As the title character, Hawkins gives a brilliantly understated performance of a woman whose painful physical limitations are only surpassed by her ability to see the inherent beauty in life and her surroundings. A hidden gem, Maudie is one of the best films of 2016 that is now likely to receive the attention it deserves, after Hawkins' heightened notoriety from her work with Guillermo del Toro in The Shape of Water."
" Maudie
",0.0,0.9926,2018-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, Maudie is a film that guides us through the life of Maud Lewis. We see a cruel yet powerful story unfold and the ending is sorrowful yet hopeful. The story does focus too much time on the love affair aspect and not enough on the painting and art part of Maud's life.The acting is great. Sally Hawkins plays Maud who is a deformed painter that loves life and people. Maud's personality can be a little annoying at times because she is so nice and carefree. Ethan Hawke, once again, delivers a stunning performance as Everett Lewis. Everett is a slightly mentally ill man who has anger management issues along with commitment issues. Hawke's acting is amazing towards the end of the film. The ending scenes shows us his emotion and his power to move on.The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is overlong. The middle part of the movie is very slow but the ending is emotional and genuine.Pros: Emotional and heartbreaking story, great acting, an emotional ending, and a great performance by Ethan HawkeCons: The film spends too much time on the love affair aspect of Maud's life, some slow pacing, and an overlong runtime.Overall Rating: 7.5P.S. I watched this film because I am a huge fan of Ethan Hawk. In every film I see him in, he performs amazing. The Before Series has Ethan Hawke in it and I would highly recommend it."

" Truly charming with a great lead performance
",0.8957,0.9612,2018-02-10 00:00:00,7,"Based on a true story: In small-town Nova Scotia, Maud Dowley (Sally Hawkins) is a shy young woman handicapped by rheumatoid arthritis and misunderstood by her family. She becomes a live-in housekeeper to Everett Lewis (Ethan Hawke), a grouchy fish peddler who lives in a small house outside of town. During her housekeeping, she discovers her enjoyment - and talent - of painting.While the characters of this film often face difficult times, director Aisling Walsh does a fine job in emphasizing the serenity of rural eastern Canada. (While the film takes place in Nova Scotia, it was filmed in Newfoundland.)The very unusual domestic arrangement would mean little today but in small-town Canada in the 1930s, it was scandalous. The silent and tense atmosphere of the film conveys this well.Hawke does a fine job in portraying his conflicted character whose anger sometimes erupts in the form of abuse but who still shows a good and caring side. His character, like others, are not given sufficient background to show how they tick. But there is more than even enough development in the portrayal of the title character - mainly because of the superb work by Hawkins.Within her physical and social limitations, Hawkins finds the perfect mix. While she is often vulnerable, she can still mutter a few words now and then that show she has a clear sense of self-worth. Her greatest scenes are in the last half when she learns more about her past and also when she gradually becomes frail with age. Hawkins' performance is the highlight of this fine film."

Think Brando in ""On the Waterfront,"" Streep in ""Sophie's Choice,"" Olivier in ""Othello,"" Stanwyck in ""Stella Dallas."" Sally's performance puts her in that select company. Then there is Ethan Hawke. What a remarkable performance in a low key, unglamorous role. Possibly his best ever. Understated yet remarkable. Few movies move me like ""Maudie"" did.

It's a biopic, about an artist, not a famous one like medieval European painters. But a well known in her native. So now the world to know about her through this flick. That's what I love about films. Sometimes it's not about the famous people, but somewhere in a small place who quietly succeeded that inspires millions if they learn about that. So the films and books do that job well.An Irish-Canadian co production. I think it has a real shot at the Oscars. Definitely for Sally Hawkins. In my opinion, she has already won that award, despite there are other good performances in this year. But if they snub this film, then as I consider like usual, the Oscars is pointless. Coming to the title, it should have been 'Maud'. Because nobody uses that word in the film. Anyway, 'Mudie' makes a good sound to pronounce, similar to Charlie, instead of Charles (Chaplin).For now, this is an under-noticed film. As always, one of the reasons is, it's not an American or a British film. Then not made by a commercially well known filmmaker and cast. But this film never meant for commercial gain. It just tells the truth. A true story of an artist who lived not only on the edge of the society, humanity as well. Because when I saw this film, I could not tell the tale from what period. My guess was the late 19th century, then surprised as the story progressed to learn the real timeline. That tells she lived a life of at least a century ago of her time.-xX] Some people don't like it if you are different. [Xx-Not a story of a high society woman. This kind of people can be found in every corner of the earth. They are somewhat discarded in the society for being different. But they too wants a normal life like everybody else. In such instance, this story happens. Maud is an orphan living with her aunt, after her brother ditched her. With no social skills, her future is not so bright. But it all changes one day when she decides to become a live-in maid to a grumpy fish seller.Initially, they find it not workable, then as the time goes by, they find each other. Following that, recognition of her paintings in the local community and spreading across, she sees some success in an unexpected path. But that's not the end of the tale. Seems happily ever after is so distant to them. A twist brings another unexpected derive in the narration. The heart rendering side of the story. From there how the remaining film would shape up before the conclusion were told.Seems everything was perfect for this film. Nice casting. I think that's the best thing happened for this. Both Sally and Ethan were amazing. Like Sally, Ethan too deserves an Oscars for his so perfect supporting role. As for the director, I think it will remain one of her best work, despite she could do good films like this in the future. This is one of the great films about the artists. Very inspiring, as well as a tearjerker, if you are a soft hearted.Low cost film, but well shot. I loved the locations. Then the dialogues. So simple and convincing. This is this year's 'Mr. Turner'. A must see film for grown ups. It got nominated for several categories in the Canadian top film awards and expected to win most of them. I hope in the coming days, it gets its due, I mean the wide recognition. Highly recommended by my side! One of my favourite biopics!9/10"

I think she's the best of the movie and that she's going to win the Oscar.The film, by the way, does not have much more to contribute. He is fine, but there are times when he seems to interpret it is not natural. I do not think that this badly chosen, but it does not reach the level of it.It seems a bit long.

" Could've Easily Missed It
",0.0516,0.9947,2017-11-30 00:00:00,8,"It's not very often in modern cinema that one can go to a cinema and watch a film that can seem to spur up every emotion that you think you can handle at the same moment. Maudie does this. This striking, beautifully shot and moving film floored me. As the projectionist at the Rex Cinema in Wareham I don't get the chance to pick and choose the films I watch but I can surely say that I would never have chosen to watch this movie if I had the choice but what a mistake that would've been from my point. Maudie follows the story of an arthritic woman who seeks out a job with as a housekeeper, who she falls in love with, as she begins to expand her artistic talent becoming a beloved figure in the community. The beauty of this film doesn't lie with the extremely beautiful landscape of Nova Scotia (the setting of this feature) but with the way she sees this landscape and the world around her. The beautiful cinematography by Guy Godfree somehow is transposed into the colourful paintings of Maud as she transports the shack she lives in into a blooming, colourful world of its own. But what brings me constantly back to Maudie is the relationship between Maud and Everett Lewis. The beauty of it lies in how different these people are which makes their relationship even more absorbing and intriguing. Its how they see each other and how their relationship grows which is the prime focus of this feature as you understand the extremely odd and harsh Everett and the beauty behind this seemingly feeble arthritic woman. Both the major performances of Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke drive this film into something further than the script. The pain that Maud goes through is astoundingly portrayed by Ms Hawkins and Ethan Hawke holds an incredibly interesting role which I was floored by. If I left this film with anything it was these actors wonderful performances. Nitpicks – The end of the 2nd act drags a touch but I didn't think it removed anything from the experience and it didn't bother me. It picked up very quickly again and I feel it is a pretty extreme nitpick. - It's hard to rate films based on real life but I wasn't quite following certain aspects of the story such as the long lost daughter being found. Overall, Maudie is an emotionally riveting feel good film that one should not miss and while there were aspects of the film that didn't hold up quite as well, the driving performances of Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke allowed me to forget these."

" Everett
",0.0,0.9972,2017-11-23 00:00:00,10,"""Maudie"" is an Irish/Canadian co-production that premiered last year already (2016), so it certainly took incredibly long for this 110-minute movie to finally get to Germany. But the wait was worth it because this was an extraordinary work and I want to explain to you why I think so. I can't really say too much about director Aisling Walsh or writer Sherry White as I don't know them or their other stuff, but their collaboration here lets me hope that they may contribute on other projects in the future. Until then, I may want to check out especially some of White's other stuff as her script is without a doubt among the best of the year. Not surprised to see this film scoring a decent deal of awards recognition already, even if I think that the big bodies (Oscars etc.) will probably not pay a great deal of attention to it sadly. The only category where it may score is with Sally Hawkins' portrayal of the title character, but she has another apparently more baity film out this year that actually has her in an early Oscar front runner spot, so this will also take some attention away from Maudie.But it shouldn't as Hawkins really deserves all the praise she gets for this one. And her male co-lead Ethan Hawke does so too. I think that he was even an ounce better than Hawkins. His portrayal may not have been as exhausting physically, but he had other areas that made his character a really big challenge and he nailed it tremendously. Be it next to Delpy, next to Arquette or next to Hawkins here. Love interest roles to a slightly more central female character may be his huge forte it seems. It's always somewhat normal, regular guys and he totally delivers in these roles. As for Maudie, this was a decent film for 60-70 minutes, but afterward it turned into real greatness and totally delivered from an emotional perspective. This is also where the film loses its occasional subtly comedic approach completely, not that that one was bad or anything, but maybe it kept the movie from delivering its dramatic strength earlier, which is a bit of a pity.One thing I liked was how even the intermediate sequences were fairly memorable. The best example is how Hawke's character is pushing the wheelbarrow early on telling Maudie to move faster to follow. Later in she sits on the barrow while finally the two are joking around with her sitting on the barrow. But that's just something I subjectively perceived. Some people may not like the daughter story line and feel it was rushed in, but to me it added a lot as it helped the film to not just focus on the complicated relationship between the two main characters, but also deliver elsewhere. Like in the painting aspect. Maybe you wonder why I mentioned it this late as this is probably what Maud Lewis is of course most known for, but it's just that this never felt as the one central component and if you are seeing the film from this perspective only, then you will maybe be disappointed. So don't as there is a lot more to appreciate in here. I don't really know how much was fictionalized here for dramatic story-telling purpose, but I don't want to know either. Or how much younger the 2 central characters are compared to the people they are portraying. It was a brilliant character study² without a doubt.Maudie's ending with her knowing she has to go soon and bringing back the dog reference for her partner is touching and real as are her final words about being loved. This also makes another connection with her husband being a decent man from the beginning (also with his professions), but also a man who suffers a great deal from anger issues and relationship troubles maybe also caused by low self-esteem. Hawke really delivered there too. You will find flaws with this film if you are looking for them, so don't and ignore the possibility that it does not even deserve the term ""biopic"" because it delivers on so many other levels. I think this was an incredibly touching work and it's really close between this one and The Glass Castle about what was the best 2017 release I have seen so far. But as this one still counts for 2016, the question does not even need to be asked. All in all, you really wanna see this one. It will make you feel happy, sad, intrigued, excited and a great deal more. Really don't miss out here. It is a must-see that I highly recommend, maybe a better watch with your significant other than with friends and you also don't need any interest in art or painting to get the most from the watch here. Don't miss out! Oh yeah, finally the title of my review is of course ""Everett"" because it is as much about him as it is about Maudie and I don't want him and Hawke's turn here to be forgotten."

His coldness is often punctuated by surprising gentle warmth. This is a complicated relationship and Maud could easily portrayed as a victim which would leave Everett as the villain. There is so much life in her performance and he kept the love in his eyes which excused his many flaws. It's heartbreaking but also life affirming with a few surprise laughs."
" Maudie: The whole of a life, beautifully painted
",0.5719,0.9909,2017-11-20 00:00:00,7,"This is a quiet, slow film. During an era when time is counted by seconds and illustrated with the clownish stunts of a President seemingly more concerned with ratings than with any fabric of life, with society's shorter and shorter attention span, when movie screens are deluged with computer generated images, million dollar special effects, car chases at maximum speed, and lead characters with superhuman physical powers, Maud Lewis stands in her space occupied by Sally Hawkins, the actress who gracefully captures the heroine's awkwardness and beauty for film, and says, ""I am to be counted."" This film is to be counted. And I'll pass on films faster than a speeding bullet and choose Hawkins and Ethan Hawke as they steadily tell the story of the real-life painter and her husband, Everett. The film is much like a painting, using images to portray a life. There are few words and barely one is wasted. The dialogue, like the house in which much of the lives are spent, is spare, using colors and landscapes and objects and faces to tell a simple, amazing story. Much like the artist, Maud Lewis, did, the filmmaker shows us how he sees her world through the sense of sight: a single, still wooden wheel against a backdrop of a brown and gold wheat field, the wooden houses of reds and blues sitting on the hills of Nova Scotia, next to the sparkling sea, still clouds against a radiant sky, a woman's face suddenly opening with a large smile. The photography is dazzling, stunning, yet soft. With all to see, the ear is not neglected: Michael Timmons, the creative force behind the band The Cowboy Junkies, uses his moody, smokey hues to gently orchestrate the score that is true to the woman at the center of the film, and a few lovely songs dot the soundtrack with emotion, language, and beginnings and ends, stirring the canvass of the lives we are invited to witness and, through adroit performances by the actors, even enter. Maudie is what Maud said of windows: ""The whole of life, already framed, right there - "" and anybody would be lucky to see how it reveals itself. 7.5/10"
" A richly endearing dramatization of a folk artist...
",0.4404,0.9511,2017-11-18 00:00:00,7,"Maudie is a richly endearing dramatization of a folk artist's life, tailored by Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke's raw performances and some rather breathtaking cinematography featuring the Canadian landscapes, heavily inspired by the artist's home. However, the passage of time is very unclear. The film obviously centers Maude's life between 1930 to her death in 1970 yet the people don't seem to physically age to a noticeable degree (at least not Maude) and the settings don't evolve with future development either. There's also not enough focus on Maude's husband Everett. I know the film's specifically about Maude, but supporting figures require depth as well. While Hawke's performance is brilliant, Everett just comes off as that cliché stick-in-the-mud who doesn't accept change. Still a wonderful art house film overall."

" a treasure trove where love can germinate from a most barren place
",0.7506,0.9959,2017-10-22 00:00:00,8,"A biopic of the arthritis-inflicted Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis (1903-1970) from Nova Scotia, directed by Irish female director Aisling Walsh, and starring a transmogrified Sally Hawkins as the scraggly Maud and Ethan Hawke as her fish peddler husband Everett Lewis. In the abstract, Maud's life is hardly newsworthy, there is no oceanic discrepancy before/after she accrues a certain renown (Richard Nixon is interested to acquire one of her works), she and Everett have never moved out of their pokey cottage. To all intents and purposes, Walsh remarkably skates over the theatricality-ready liaison between Maud's physical defect and her immeasurable talent, the disability is a congenital condition for her to inure, a cross to bear but never her defining feature, and it is up to Hawkins' diligent yet histrionics-free incarnation to ram home to audience her distinct physical form is part of the furniture of her identity, it never deters her life-long pursuit. What undergoes a fine-tooth comb is Maud and Everett's complex relationship, the jumping-off point of their co-habitation is out of pragmatism other than anything remotely affecting, he wants a housemaid and she wants to slough from the clutches of her officious aunt Ida (Rose). For Maud, it is a precarious gamble because she throws herself on the mercy of Everett, who grudgingly takes her in (initially appalled by her unsightly appearance) and belittles her in the lowest rung in his bare-bones household: him, dogs, chickens, then her. At one point, Maud can only squeeze some wry but ironic laughter after being referred as ""a love slave"" of Everett, she is a slave to him without question, but there is no love involved. Maud's tremendous effort of thawing the illiterate Everett's unsavory make-up (inarticulate, churlish, penny-pinching, machismo you name it) offers a most therapeutic, wholesome and alternately heart-warming/heart-wrenching narrative arc by virtue of writer Sherry White's sensitive, sensible and no-hyperbole script; Walsh's unobtrusively observant tack against a muted but fetchingly beauteous scenery; soothing ear-worms (e.g. Lisa Hannigan's LITTLE BIRD) and needless to say Hawke and Hawkins' stupendous performances. Hawke is unexpectedly against type to give an uncouth Everett a humane transfiguration that mostly hinges on ineffable expressions, a look, a mumble, a gesture, greatly pins down a reticent man's innate foibles but also his rough diamond sheen. On the other hand, Hawkins, formidably sinks her teeth into the character body and soul, a vivid impersonation of an enabler, a fighter and most of all, a human whom we can all vicariously project ourselves in on different levels, a true testimonial of why humanity is still worthy of redemption and sympathy in our cynical world. Maud's last word is ""I am loved"", and MAUDIE is a treasure trove where love can germinate from a most barren place, a superlative folksy delight and heartening character study, kudos to those talents who are involved in the film's timely genesis."

",0.0,0.9592,2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"We really wanted to like this movie. It's a true story, starring Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke who are both excellent actors. And it's filmed in the stunning scenery of Nova Scotia. But it's just incredibly slow and really far too long. And not much happens. On the other hand, it is beautifully acted (Sally Hawkins is amazing in her portrayal of a deeply shy woman suffering crippling juvenile arthritis), and we did end up sticking it through to the end. If Art-house movies are your thing, you'll probably love it. If not, then you have been warned."
" An inspiring and heartfelt story
",0.743,0.9733,2017-09-23 00:00:00,10,"My favourite film so far this year : Sally Hawkins is mesmerising as Maudie and gives a performance,which is truly Academy Award .worthy. Ethan Hawke is equally good as her crusty damaged husband Everett. He describes their relationship as "" two odd socks ""and they fit perfectly together with quite a few holes. If you get a chance this is a not to be missed movie it's like a Mahler symphony and is quite inspirational. So grateful we have Mt Vic Flix in the mountains if it wasn't for their existence we wouldn't see quality cinema. You don't need a mega budget or Hollywood for that matter to produce a gem of a movie."
" A lovely story, well told
",0.7096,0.9933,2017-09-10 00:00:00,7,"There are no special effects in Maudie, and it moves as slowly as a tortoise, but it's refreshing to see a feature film concentrating on the true tale of a modest but tragic Canadian artist, Maud Lewis, and her crotchety husband, Everett. The cinematography is luscious, making use of different lights and seasons, and of town, sea and pastoral locations. Sally Hawkins is excellent as Maude - portraying just how strong she was in the face of a nasty and hostile brother and aunt, who prefer to issue vitriol rather than love. Maud moves in as housekeeper to Everett (Ethan Hawke) because she has nowhere else to go. He really is a brute, seeing her as less than a dog and also beating her. Only somewhat mitigating his behaviour is the fact he was brought up in an orphanage. Hawke beautifully conveys that Everett doesn't know how to love or be loved. He knows how to survive, and give orders, although while at first Maude is an unwelcome burden to him, he slowly lets her in, just enough for a partly functional marriage to develop. I love how the movie shows how art - Maude's simple paintings of animals and the landscape - can offer great solace, self-expression and allows her to transcend her harsh life of poverty and isolation. It literally brightens up Maude's small, drab house. It provides an income, and also is an escape from her severe arthritis. Her gift gives her so much! I was left with the impression that Maude was a hero. She tried to make the most of life. Her rich, art dealer friend yearns to be able to paint, and it's truly an enviable talent."
" Tearfully delightful
",0.5859,0.9508,2017-09-06 00:00:00,10,"I believe what makes this film a delightful experience isn't so much the story but the brilliant performances by Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke. As the two main characters Maud & Everett these two actors become the characters they are portraying.Here is a simple story of two socially inept people that find one another and experience all the joy, anger, heartbreak and peace that goes with love. The setting is both beautiful and bleak - just like Maud & Everett!Anyone who is incapable of getting emotionally involved with these two and their story as it is being portrayed on screen has an emptiness in their heart."
" Go see this film if you've forgotten how to feel
",-0.2263,0.8628,2017-09-04 00:00:00,9,"It's a long time since I've seen a film as affecting as this (principally because it isn't emotionally manipulative, which I always resent). Instead it just tells a simple tale of simple folk living in simple times, between whom love eventually blossoms against the odds. It's also a sobering reminder of how hard times were in the early 20th century in rural communities, where gossip and malice were endemic, people worked their fingers to the bone and there was no room for sentimentality. That very unsentimental ethos permeates the film, though of course in many cases it tips over into cruelty, and the cruelty Maudie suffers is at times unbearable. Yet for those tempted to walk out, stick with it because her life improves and she evens starts to smile a bit, once the art therapy kicks in. Take a box of Kleenex, expect to feel humbled (and never to complain again about your affluent neuroses). Beyond that, both leads (Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke) are great, and the photography of Newfoundland & Nova Scotia is beautiful, capturing the seascapes and landscapes in the brilliant light."

" Maudie .........simplicity raised to an art form
",0.0,0.9847,2017-08-24 00:00:00,9,"In reading a review what do you want to know? Is this going to be worth my time to watch it? Here's why I think the answer is yesIf quality acting is your thing then Sally Hawkins' portrayal of a beautiful personality emerging as a butterfly from a chrysalis of pain and abuse is irresistible. Ethan Hawke will have you constantly trying to work out whether his 'damaged' Everett is going to be worthy of the priceless prize of Maudies love. You will love to hate the despicable Aunt Ida, whose depravity deepens as the film lengthens. The blank canvass of her brothers' insipid lack of personality perfectly explains his life goal of obtaining money. There is a delicious sense of divine justice meted out to Mauds family. None of the supporting cast fails to deliver their messages.If cinematography is your thing then the wide landscapes in the different seasons will never get old. Each of the panoramic views has purpose, if not to illustrate Maudies difficulty with mobility, then to see the world as she did in its awesome simplicity.Those of you who enjoy subtleties of screenplay will be the most rewarded of all. I especially enjoyed the absence of cliché. Most notably when Everett takes Maudie to see the occupant of the little white house. Like Maudies art the magnificence of simplicity is the overarching theme. The truly nonsensical quote from Maudie : 'The whole of life, already framed, right there' is from one's own perspective.........our life cannot be encapsulated by the view from a single window. But Maudies could. Which is why she achieved what some religions call Nirvana. She recognized kindness and rewarded it. Not with grand gestures or verbosity, but simply with a smile. Its worth watching if that's all you learn."
" Maudie At The Movies
",0.0,0.9758,2017-08-13 00:00:00,9,"Hello. I saw this film on Saturday, August 12, 2017 at the Arbor Theatre in Austin, Texas. I had seen a trailer of this film and wanted to see it. The only thing I had known about the film was that she was an artist. SPOILER ALERT: I wasn't sure about the time period of the film, until there was a mention of Vice-President Nixon. Then, I knew. Maudie is a lady full of spirit and love, despite her limitations. I was wondering how she was going to manage living with that fishmonger. It wasn't what I expected. Maudie tries to make a go of it in her new surroundings. Her employer didn't make it easy. Later on, he mellowed and grew to love her, in his own way. For the most part, Ethan Hawke played his character very stoically. Sally Hawkins (Maudie)was simply amazing! The last part of the film shows the real life Maudie in her home in Nova Scotia. This is a wonderful little film, that hopefully gets some recognition during awards season."
" A bit of a plod...
",0.0,0.9678,2017-08-11 00:00:00,7,"Maudie, despite Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke, lacked a lot of things, especially the skill and talent of a decent professional director and a creative writer. The two actors are good enough to almost get you through, but there must, at times, have been some tenderness, and always a joke or two. But the film trudges along gloomily, without variation. It doesn't get an audience involved. It has too earnest an aim. It is utterly humourless. It is rather DULL. The lack of variation in pace is like these plodding sentences. I am going to sleep As the credits started to roll we were shown a black and white documentary of the real Maudie, a tiny wraith-like figure who 'came out wrong', but with a richer reality, in just a few seconds, than the impression offered on screen."
" Maudie: Two Broken Characters Find Each-other.
",-0.4767,0.9693,2017-08-07 00:00:00,8,"A melodrama, based on a true story, set in Nova Scotia over a 30 year period. Sally Hawkins plays the female lead (Maudie), an arthritic hunchback, she is a little simple and frail, but someone who has an artistic gift. When facing difficult or emotional situations she is seen rushing to paint, this is her coping mechanism. Ethan Hawk plays the male lead (Everett), a moody fish seller and 'do-it-all' handyman. He has a violent temper originating from a poor childhood, raised in a children's home and an evidently hard present-day life. Maudie answers a shop advert to be Everett's housekeeper, it's clear that no-one else would have tolerated Everett's fiery behaviour. However, they became a couple over time and they eventually get married, both realising they were the best either would ever get.One of Everett's customers notices and appreciates Maudie's art and agrees to purchase everything she can produce. Even though Maudie's art is naïve with a childish quality it's even acclaimed by the president and he also buys a piece, the wide admiration results in rapid fame.Later in the film we learn that Maudie had a baby many years previously that she believes had died. But we discover actually survived and was adopted, Maudie tracks her down and is content that her daughter's adult life is normal and happy (though they do not meet.)Maudie suffers with emphysema from heavy smoking, this does not have a good outcome for her. The film is very well made, with some Oscar worthy performances, particularly from Sally Hawkins. As is normal, we see actual vintage film footage of the couple during the end credits. Recommended."

",0.6114,0.9578,2017-08-03 00:00:00,9,"MAUDIE - a mini review This beautifully told story deserves your attention! Maudie is a taleof a lonely, afflicted woman who creates a space for herself in this world by dint of her pluck, artistic talent and charm.The principals are Sally Hawkins as Maudie and Ethan Hawke as a gruff and even abusive fisherman who hires Maud as his housekeeper. How the rest of the relationship develops is the essence of the story, and I won't spoil it here. Hawkins' performance is Oscar- worthy and calls for substantial emoting. Hawkes' role calls for more restraint and infinite shades of ""dumbfoundedness"" irritation, bewilderment, and occasional apercu of realization. He shows these emotions with only slight changes of expression that are fun to watch.Maud Lewis was a self-taught artist, kind of like a Grandma Moses of Canada. The landscape is Prince Edward Island, which I was fortunate to have visited a few weeks ago. Lovely landscapes and great Nature views abound. I saw ""Dunkirk"" the week prior.

" Two socially awkward people find unexpected love
",0.5574,0.9796,2017-08-03 00:00:00,9,"Maud Lewis today is one of Canada's best-known primitive painters—quite an accomplishment for a poor, chronically ill woman from a townspeck between the Bay of Fundy and St. Mary's Bay. This charming film, written by Sherry White and directed by Aisling Walsh, tells her story. At least in the way that biopics do, leaving you wondering, was Maud's husband really so prickly? Did they really live in a tiny one-room house? Further research indicates the answers to those questions are probably not and yes. Maud suffered from painful juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, which may have stunted her growth, and an equally painful awkwardness in social interactions. In marrying Everett Lewis, she finds a man even more emotionally and socially stunted than she is. I can't say enough about how beautifully Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke play these odd characters. Physically, it had to be a taxing role for Hawkins, because Maud walks with difficulty and, as time passes, becomes more and more bent over. But a wide smile comes readily to a woman who can look at a window and say, ""The whole of life, already framed, right there""—both to Hawkins and in photos and film of the real-life Maud. They find each other when Everett looks for a woman to cook and clean his one-room house while he runs his fish-peddling and junk collecting businesses. Maud is looking for an escape from under the thumb of her judgmental aunt. When he advertises for help in the general store, this tiny woman appears on his doorstep. She brings order to the house, but Maud's real desire is to paint. She starts by decorating the walls of Ev's house, then scrap construction materials he's brought home. From there, her career as an artist blossoms like her paintings, but since they charge about $5 per picture, it never makes them much money. Maudie is an uplifting story about a person who made the most of her gifts and whose efforts were recognized in her lifetime, far outside their Marshalltown, Nova Scotia, home. Because she had modest goals—""I've got everything I want with you, Ev. Everything.""—she found tremendous satisfaction and joy in her life, despite its challenges. (Many of Maud Lewis's paintings are now in the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, as is the Lewises' actual house, restored after the Gallery acquired it in 1984. In May 2017, a Maud Lewis painting sold at auction for $45,000.)"
" Outstanding bio-pic of Canadian artist Maud Lewis
",0.6124,0.9912,2017-07-30 00:00:00,8,"""Maudie"" (2016 release from Canada; 115 min.) is a movie about Nova Scotia painter Maud Lewis. As the movie opens, we see an arthritic Maud struggling to work on a painting. After that we go back in time, to the 1930s, when Maud is du(m)ped by her brother Charles, who has sold the parental home without Maud knowledge or consent. Now stuck at her aunt Ida (who doesn't think much of Maude either but gets paid to care for her), Maud is desperate for a change. As luck would have it, aloof fisherman Everett Lewis puts up a sign at the local grocery store: ""looking for live in housemaid, must have cleaning tools"". Maud grabs the sign, and Everett reluctantly takes her on. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: ""Maudie"" was written by Canadian writer-producer Sherry White, and directed by Irish director Aisling Walsh, so no shortage on women star power! They lovingly recreate the key moments in Maud's life and the movie works almost flawlessly in the fist hour, when we see Maud and Ev as ""the odd couple"". Beware, at times it is difficult to watch (one instance in particular, which produced a mass groan from the theater audience). I thought that the second hour of the movie would be straight-forward, but boy, was I wrong (no worries, I won't spoil). British actress Sally Hawkins (who was nominated for an Oscar for her role in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmin) gives a TOWERING performance as Maud, give this woman another Oscar nomination already! Ethan Hawke is equally up to the task as Everett. The film eyes beautifully (and filmed entirely in Newfoundland, as stated in the end credits). One thing I did not ""get"" is the movie's title, as I did not hear anyone in the movie refer to Maud as ""Maudie""... Last but not least, there is a wonderful score, courtesy of Canadian musician Michael Timmins (yes, he of Cowboy Junkies), reminding me of some early Mark Knopfler's soundtracks. I will seek that out. ""Maudie"" opened at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate acclaim. The movie opened this weekend at my local art house theater and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday early evening screening was attended nicely, I'm happy to say. Surely this movie will generate strong word-of-mouth. If you are up a top-notch bio-pick of one of Canada's most beloved painters, you are in for a treat, be it at the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
" Gorgeous...
",0.0,0.9984,2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"There is quote by Kurt Vonnegut that comes to mind when I think of Maudie, the latest film based on the real life and times of an artist. ""Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something."" That may sound like a backhanded compliment but if Maud Lewis was portrayed accurately in the film, I doubt she'll mind. To her painting wasn't a source of ego or pride. It was something she just did - to make herself happy - and if it made others happy all the better.The film picks up with Maudie, played with understated sensitivity by Sally Hawkins, as she struggles and fails to earn the respect of her family. Despite her severe arthritis, Maudie answers an advert for a live-in maid and runs away. She moves in with and eventually marries the crotchety Everett Lewis (Hawke), a fishmonger who manages to put on a grim smile but once over the film's 40+ year time span. After a time living in Everett's dimly lit squalor, Maudie relights her passion for painting using abandoned cork board and the walls of her new home to paint continuously.The true-life Maudie was eventually considered Canada's most popular and prolific folk artist; though one could hardly tell given the solitude that follows Maudie throughout her life. In the film, she remains isolated, largely due to her debilitating arthritis and painful shyness around strangers. There's one awkward scene early on where Maud struggles to shuffle out of a doorway and stick her head out long enough to compliment a woman's shoes. In that moment we realize her deep desire to be both accepted and left alone.The film aptly compliment's the artist's own frailties and unconventionality with a strikingly brittle and unconventional love story. Maud's warmth towards Everett is sincere and unconditional. She sees in him, a beautiful person - an outcast like her who has been made wild by the cruelties of life but nevertheless deserves her love. As open as Maudie is to the inner-beauties of a warm sunset, Everett remains as cold and brutal as a winter storm. Yet every time he ""puts a foot down,"" he wordlessly capitulates. He grumbles and erupts in objectively despicable behavior but Maud always seems to convince him that he's capable of love and being loved.The film continues down this path of bittersweet co-dependence and as the relationship develops, we see the results of Maud's patience and virtue. Thanks to the remarkably assured cinematography of Guy Godfree, the film crackles with natural beauty and warmth of a cozy hearth. There are some truly breathtaking natural vistas on display here, which despite their expanse manage to feel intimate and idyllic.As a film Maudie is certainly within the ranks of Mr. Turner (2014), My Left Foot (1989) and Lust for Life (1956). Much like those films, Maudie centers on the life of a tortured artist whose personal story tells something truly meaningful about the human condition. It also has a truly award-worthy performance by Sally Hawkins who is at this point in a class of her own."

",0.6249,0.9816,2017-07-22 00:00:00,10,"For me, this is the reason I go to the movies. Always in the expectation that when I walk out of the theater I simply will not be touching the ground. This does not happen frequently, but with ""Maudie"" the magic occurred. An amazing story eloquently told. Sally Hawkins is superb, touching and profoundly human. Ethan Hawke is at his best. There is a believable chemistry between these battered beings. When they do take flight, they soar over this crude grandiose landscape so beautifully captured on film.It's early, but the award community have a sure bet in this unforgettable gem."
" beautiful, rough and kind love
",0.91,0.9964,2017-07-22 00:00:00,9,"Director Aisling Walsh directed movie Maudie about Maud Lewis played extremely well by Sally Hawkins( loved sally Hawkins in Blue Jasmine)and her mean husband Everett Lewis played well by Ethan Hawke(one of my favorite actors, terrific in every movie). Maud has arthritis which makes her stoop and have a crooked appearance. But Maud has a good brain for numbers and her hands can paint very well. After moving in with Lewis as his housekeeper, Maud slowly takes over every aspect of his life. Maude can sweep, clean, paint and also defend Lewis if anyone expresses distrust or disrespect. The relationship between Lewis and Maude is very touching and it is absolutely beautiful to see Lewis pay close attention to everything that Maude needs and says. Lewis may not be sophisticated but is very careful to Maude's desires. Loved the scene when Maude wanted screen door and Lewis first response was a no and then out of his quiet love puts up a screen door. Lewis love for Maudie is obvious in his caring actions and Maudie's love for Lewis is clear from her talk to him and to anyone about him. Maudie is another great movie about husbands and wives(Beautiful mind, King's speech, Fences ). Some scenes in town could be edited. Ethan Hawke as aging, bitter Lewis is good. Sally Hawkins performance as Maudie is excellent. Oscar worthy acting by Sally Hawkins."

" a gentle portrait of a gentle artist
",0.7003,0.9989,2017-07-13 00:00:00,8,"At first glance the film Maudie (2017) appears to be little more than a story about famous Canadian painter Maudie Lewis, an arthritic woman who painted childlike images in early 1900s Nova Scotia. But this description is far too simple. The slow visual and emotional delights of this film are the kind that catch you unawares while you are waiting for the narrative to gather pace and reveal a bigger story.It is no spoiler to say that there is no bigger story: it's all about small detail. The opening scenes show a crippled hand barely able to hold a paintbrush, slowly etching the outline of a flower then filling it with vibrant colour. Some may call it childlike, but Maudie (Sally Hawkins) paints the world that she wants to see, not the one where children throw stones at her because she is different. An orphan mistreated by her aunt and brother, she is determined to break out, find a jobjust be normal. She responds to a housekeeper advert and meets surly fishmonger Everett (Ethan Hawke) who is too inarticulate to send her away. He lets her stay in his one-room timber shack but makes it clear that he regards her as lower than a farmyard chicken. He is brutish and coarse, while she is determined to see good in him. Despite her mistreatment, they form an unlikely bond and Everett allows her to paint flowers and wildlife on his drab walls. Her talent is noticed by a well-heeled New Yorker who surprises them by buying some paintings. Maudie paints more, interest grows, Everett does housework to allow Maudie to paint, and over time she becomes an internationally famous artist.This simple tale is strewn with beautiful small moments. There is a simple purity in seeing a hunched figure with withered hands slowly creating a bright pretty world with gentle brushstrokes, then smiling at what she sees. Maudie has a natural gift for finding warmth and happiness in alien places. A particularly touching moment is when Maudie learns the real fate of the baby she had lost at childbirth many years before. Despite the apparent differences between the optimist Maudie and the belligerent Everett, the two of them slowly evolve an emotional inter-dependency. Sally Hawkins fills her role with extraordinary expressiveness: with just a raised eyebrow or a wry turn of her lip she emotes with brush-like precision on the audience's emotional canvas. Ethan Hawke is excellent in playing an emotionally stunted man of few words who communicates through body language and grunted vocal tones. With minimal dialogue, so much that is not said is felt clearly.The film's fine grain is not its only strength. The cinematography of Nova Scotia village life seamlessly shifts from the landscape's natural beauty to close-ups of Maudie in pain but smiling elfishly as she finds good in all. Some may find it slow-moving, but the storytelling's gentle pace is perfect in this portrait of a gentle artist."
" Watching Sally Hawkins Act Can Make Your Heart Grow Ten Times Larger
",0.0,0.98,2017-07-13 00:00:00,7,"The film MAUDIE doesn't always hold the line between pathos & schmaltz. It hits most of its notes in clear, concise, but in unambitious ways. It sometimes redundantly says things that have been clearly and more powerfully shown. It's a bit of a hand holder and not all that courageous creatively. However, it beautifully photographs Nova Scotia, the mise en scène and costumes are fantastic, and Ethan Hawk does a damn fine job holding his own...But the real takeaway is this: watching Sally Hawkins act can make your heart grow ten times larger. She is transcendent. The film stayed in my mind solely because of the work she put on that screen.PS: Showing documentary footage of the actual Maud and Everett Lewis at the end of the film rammed home just what a beautified, Hollywood-esque, version of this story MAUDIE is and made me long for something more authentic and true to the reality I saw in those final shots."
" Hawkins and Hawke shine in this odd biopic.
",-0.3869,0.9861,2017-07-09 00:00:00,7,"Maudie: Hawkins and Hawke shine in this odd biopic. Maudie is slow, deliberately slow. My modern sensibility didn't like the pace. I wanted to know what was next for the Maud. But I had to wait, and wait, and wait. And in the end, it wasn't the pace that was the main issue with the film. The lack of character development and back story was problematic. Both Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke did well portraying these odd Nova Scotian residents. They are a couple out of time who live off the grid in a small town on the coast of Canada. The characters and setting are compelling; however, their back stories were not well developed. We never learn what motivates Lewis and even Maud's back story is insufficient. Both characters are damaged. We get a glimpse as to why Maude might be vulnerable and less than capable, but we have little information regarding Lewis's impairment. Why does he not trust others, ""hate people"" as he says, what led him to this place? Certainly, it's a movie about Maud, but Lewis is the other main character in the film. As for Maud, her character is revealed little by little and I wanted more. Why does she love painting? The movie only hints at the reasons. The beauty of Nova Scotia is skillfully captured by the cinematography of Guy Godfree. And the music works well for the tone of the film. The film won't get much attention from the academy, but Hawkins' performance is Oscar worthy, being at once sincere and unsentimental. And depending on the coming competition, Hawke might deserve a nod as well for best actor. Rating: MatinéeIt's a decent biopic with some flaws in the delivery of the story and two spectacular performances. Peace, Tex Shelters"
" Opposites and Similar
",0.0,0.9977,2017-07-07 00:00:00,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. As the saying goes, ""opposites attract"". It seems the bond between Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis and her reclusive employer/husband Everett Lewis prove this so – at least at first glance. However, digging deeper, as director Aisling Walsh and writer Sherry White do so expertly here, we discover an abundance of subtle similarities and life events that connect these two  showing yet again that real life is often stranger than fiction.Sally Hawkins delivers her best performance to date (and a slam dunk Oscar nomination awaits) as Maud. She somehow manages to look even smaller on screen and capture the twisted, painful posture and movements of one stricken with severe arthritis. Ethan Hawke is Everett, the local fish peddler who lives like a hermit in his one-and-a-half room shack on the outskirts of town. Our first glimpse of Maude has her sneaking a cigarette on her Aunt's porch while she listens to family members argue about who has to care for her. We first see Everett has he stomps into the general store demanding the shopkeeper write out and post his job opening for domestic help.Filmed in Canada and Ireland, cinematographer Guy Godfree captures the harshness of the seasons and, more impressively, the claustrophobic and sparse living conditions of Maud and Everett's tiny home (nothing like the HGTV segments). Maud's sweetness and never-ending ability to find joy in the moment contrasts with Everett's cantankerous and even initially cruel approach. These polar opposites are both societal outcasts, but eventually develop respect and yes, even love (though such a word would never be exchanged between the two). Hawkins and Hawke share two especially fabulous scenes – their initial meeting in his house, and a many-years-later emotional exchange on a bench. Hawke's character is a bit challenging for the audience, but Hawkins captures our heart immediately.Supporting work is minimal, yet effective, as Zachary Bennett plays Maud's brother Charles, Gabrielle Rose is her Aunt Ida, and Kari Matchett is Sandra – the New Yorker with the fancy shoes who first spots Maud's talent. Much of the story focuses on Everett's pride and Maud's joy/spirit, while slowly they both gain a bit of fame thanks to her artistic talent and their living arrangement.Ms. Hawkins has long been an underrated actress (despite last year's Oscar nomination), and her turn in Happy-Go-Lucky (2008) was proof she could carry the lead. Here, seeing her hoist such a real life character and story on her hunched back is a thing of beauty and is not to be missed. It's an artful movie about an artist and making the best of life. The film's music is perfectly understated and features acoustic guitar, violin and piano. It should be noted that the end of the film features a clip of the real Maud and Everett, and their house has been preserved and displayed at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia."
" Possibly the strangest love story I've seen in cinema, but a beautiful story about being happy.
",0.9325,0.9786,2017-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Sally Hawkins plays Maudie Who was born physically challenged. In order to prove she can take care of herself she answers an ad pinned in the local store by Everett Lewis played by Ethan Hawke to be his somewhat live-in maid, and they end up being each other's soulmates. Despite his horrible behavior she actually thrived as an artist living interdependently with him.Hawkins and Hawke made a great team. It was a compelling relationship to watch unfold on the screen. It was a small and quiet movie and depended on how good these two acted with each other, and they were so good, I loved them both and the people that they played."
" A heartwarming film that had the potential to be better
",0.7184,0.983,2017-07-01 00:00:00,7,"A heartwarming, tranquil ode to the simplicity of art and life. Based on the true story, Sally Hawkins is wonderful as Maud Lewis, the housewife turned folk artist who escaped her imprisoned family life to live freely and become a beloved figure in her isolated Canadian community. The film was effective in showing the serene lifestyle of the country but spent too much time delving into her love life when it could have fittingly and effectively expressed Maud's love for art in order for us to fully embrace her character."
" Folk as Art
",0.0,0.9957,2017-07-01 00:00:00,10,"Folk Art is art that is not defined by your traditional academic notions of what art should be, whether technical or aesthetic. Folk is an old word, from old high German, basically meaning people in general. ""Maudie"" is a movie about folks, especially one very important central figure who happens to be a folk artist. Maud Lewis is her name, and it's very likely she never classified her art by any term whatsoever during her life, much less folk art. Her art is just something she did.""Maudie"" is a sweet little biopic movie that at times is a bit disturbing. The disturbing aspects are subtle. The creators/directors gloss over some of the finer points of her life, with some alterations of the truth. However, the important questions are asked, literally, during the movie. It's up to the viewer to see these aspects, or not, and take them for what they are. Your reactions or discernment thereof may depend on prior knowledge or research of the subject.What is clear from almost the outset the movie, is that Maud and her husband led a difficult life - not quite but almost abject poverty. Yet Maud filled her life with beauty through her art. Flickers of relative fame touched her life briefly, but it was not until well after her death in 1970 that full appreciation was recognized, not that she really cared about these things.""Maudie"" is a small movie with big performances by the mains, especially Sally Hawkins. In my opinion, her performance as Maud is the best this year so far, but I can guarantee right now that you will hear her name come Oscar time next year. Ethan Hawke is also exceptional as her husband Everett, although the role itself is a bit more static. The supporting cast - mostly unknowns - does well in more cardboard cut- out roles, but Matchett, a Canadian actress who you might recognize from some American TV roles does a nice job as one of her earliest patrons.Will you like this movie? I don't know, but I loved it. It is what it is, not an action movie, but a small art-house drama/biopic of a very interesting and amazing person who lived most of her life in obscurity. This movie affected me not just during the viewing, with tears streaming slowly down my face, but well after. The tears that came were not only sad but also from joy at her creations, but most of all they stemmed from my belief that beauty and sweetness deserves beauty and sweetness and, well, Maud had very little of that in her life.Many biopics have been made of famous people that rose out of obscurity or extremely challenging situations or disabilities to achieve greatness and renown. What really interested and touched me about Maud's story is there was no rise.(Interesting side note: Maud sold her paintings during her life for a few coins to a few dollars at most. Now her paintings are selling for six figures)"
" Hawkins and Hawke shine in one of the year's best films.

Poignant and wonderful biopic about Canadian artist Maud Lewis (a compelling portrait of restraint and heart-break by an Oscar worthy Hawkins), whose broken winged dove of a human being, finds herself finding herself when she is ousted from her family's home by her jerk brother and selfish aunt. Seeking employment and a place to live she becomes the unlikely companion to gruff worker Everett Lewis (well-crafted job of nuanced grouchiness by Hawke) who eventually falls in love with the truly lovable and humble Maudie. Filmmaker Aisling Walsh does a remarkably efficient job in her big-screen debut after cutting her teeth on television balancing the possibly maudlin and mawkish instead with undeniable warmth, compassion and skill. Guy Godfree's lovely cinematography and the gentle score by Michael Timmins are on point. One of the year's best films."
" Maudie
",0.0,0.9991,2017-06-10 00:00:00,8,"Maudie, the new film about Canadian artist Maud Lewis, is at times a disturbing watch, but as a whole it is a very fascinating film on a number of different levels. Before, I went to see this new film, I looked up various pictures and images of Maud's different paintings and I honestly have to say that a lot of what I saw I did like. I am certainly no art critic and do not pretend to be one either, but with Maud's paintings I found myself loving her bright use of primary colours as well as the sometimes very simplistic style she used to paint with and I found this further enhanced her work by not being overly flashy, or showy, but instead it has more of a primitive almost at times childlike style, or way it was done, but instead of looking amateurish it instead highlights her grand use of colours and accentuates what she is painting and gives the whole thing a very pleasing look that I think words like bright, or happy could definitely accompany her body of work. Needless to say with the examples I saw online as well as the pieces that were showcased in this new film, I would consider myself a fan of her work and if I was to come across one of her pictures in a store, I would definitely consider buying it and hanging it up with my other collection of prints by various other modern artists. The other fascinating thing about this new film are the characters of Maud herself and her husband Everett Lewis. Both are complicated characters in a lot of ways and while at times their relationship is sometimes very difficult to watch, there is also a certain tenderness and mutual admiration that these two characters have for each other, even if they do not show it openly, or as evidently as perhaps most people would. Maud, is often hunched over and has a lot of difficulty walking and performing everyday tasks from what we later learn is arthritis, but I would not be surprised if there were other factors involved in this as well. Maud also has a certain childlike way to her as well. Sometimes she can be downright stubborn about a certain situation and at times she can also be very socially awkward and at times could easily mimic, or be confused with someone struggling with any number of types of autism. At other times she seems to have a general rosy type view of things and for the most part she seems to be a pragmatist and tries to look on the brighter side of life and in a lot of ways she will often forgo her own feelings, or wants to the extent that she is always willing to please and often puts her own happiness aside to please others. Everett, on the other hand is a man who seems to be extremely rough around the edges. Whenever we see him he mostly has a huge scowl on his face and looks unhappy and pretty much is angry and bitter a lot of the time. This causes what is a lot of the dysfunction, or at least what appears to be difference from the norm in his relationship with Maud. Everett, we learn was most likely an orphan and most of his life he seems to have been away and never truly gotten to integrate himself into life with other people, or mastering the terribly tricky thing of human relationships and even the basic levels of how to interact with other people. He often seems like a very self centered and sometimes downright cold and mean man. However as the film goes on we definitely do see his relationship with Maud tested on a number of different issues and yet they are always sticking by each other no matter what situation may present itself. Deep down I think they both had a sense of love for one another. It may be different than what most people would consider love, but I think it was still there even if it was hard to see at times. The performances by Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke are terrific and give much depth and also much to contemplate after watching them perform as these characters and they also do a fine job of establishing just how complex these people were. The body language, facial movements and mannerisms are all done to perfection and these are certainly two performances that will be noticed come awards time next year. I also like how the film did not sugar coat, or suggest an easy life for either of these two characters, but instead shows you them in the best and worst of times. The art aspect and Maud's paintings also make for intriguing viewing, but what is most evident to me here is a story of two polar opposite people trying to make a go of it and perhaps doing better than most people could say of their own relationships. Certainly food for thought and an intriguing notion the film leaves you with which is one of it's truly commendable qualities as well as being a great biopic, but more than that a truly unorthodox relationship that may be difficult to watch at times, but certainly is rewarding as well."
" An amazing film that captures a time and a complex relationship
",0.5859,0.9836,2017-05-09 00:00:00,10,"Although shot in Canada, and although it is about a Canadian, I don't like affixing the term Canadiana to it. It is a Universal movie about the indomitable spirit that some people possess even when faced with horrendous turns of fate. Sally Hawkins is incredibly good as Maud and Ethan Hawke does a superb job of playing Everett Lewis. Hawkins has the accents , the movements, the wry smile and the light that just won't stop shining. Hawke's performance is very nuanced: his character was an emotional cripple and he was violent, but we also know how much he loved and admired his wife. It was a time when dirt poor men asked for nothing, did whatever they must to survive and didn't allow expression of feelings in their lives. Many reviewers have called him ""vile"", but he could have been a miner, for example, anywhere in the world as easily as a fish seller in Nova Scotia in 1930. I think Ethan Hawke did an amazing job of capturing that man. It has great cinematography, excellent score and a minimalist script that allows, through actual superb acting, to get to know a pair of characters in a movie like never before. Don't miss this one!!"
" Gorgeous, charming Canadiana
",0.8316,0.9692,2017-04-29 00:00:00,8,"Painting in Nova Scotia! With arthritis! Sounds riveting, doesn't it? No, not really. So I was a little surprised when Maudie, a Canadian production, was getting international attention and even Oscar buzz, with its international cast. It's actually an Irish co-production, continuing an apparent marriage following the two countries' Room and Brooklyn (both 2015).It's more apparent, upon seeing the film, what the appeal is. Maudie is a solid drama, with strong performances by Hawke and Hawkins (don't get those two surnames confused). Hawke is challenged to be brutish with deeply hidden tender undertones, and largely succeeds, though with the character's violent tendencies I wouldn't exactly characterize the film as romantic, and would advice Maud Lewis to split. Hawkins simultaneously acts crippled, while maintaining shades of optimism and slyness, a somewhat similar challenge to what got Eddie Redmayne an Oscar as Stephen Hawking (another surname not to confuse). The paintings we see range from charming and cute, at best, to childish and bewilderingly popular, at worst. It was also refreshing to see a true-story movie without the mandatory captions at the end telling us about what happened to the survivors and to Lewis' posthumous artistic reputation, because I'm getting sick and tired of that. The performances, plus gorgeous photography of Newfoundland coasts and virtually anything else that comes into frame, make Maudie a winner."
" will warm your heart
",0.2263,0.9772,2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"What a good film. And most impressive is that it is actually based on a true story (sorry, I haven't done my research before the film, so when the documentary bits came at the end, I was like No way, that was actually for real!). I am not sure it can really be called a ""feel good"" movie - life wasn't that easy for her. But it will certainly warm your heart with a big and powerful message that we don't really need much to be happy.Sally Hawkins was absolutely great. With that shy but ready smile and wondering eyes. Although I felt kind of sorry for the way they portrayed her husband. Not sure if he was as brute in real life as they made him. Not that I know, of course, but it felt too much (and he looked smiley enough in the documentary bits). Also, I'd say the editing was not as smooth as it could have been so felt rather amateurish overall, but maybe that was intentional."
" Crippled, abused woman finds spirit and fulfillment in painting.
",-0.3818,0.9785,2017-02-10 00:00:00,9,"An Irish director casts a British woman and an American star in the — thus — quintessentially Canadian film about a national treasure, Nova Scotia folk artist Maud Lewis. As a woman and as an artist Maud is a heroically resilient figure. She survives life with a brutish husband, accepting a succession of indignities, some outrageous. Gradually she establishes her own rights, identity and even name. Though crippled with arthritis, Maud becomes a famous and esteemed artist. (Now you can add ""expensive"" — those little five-dollar painted boards go for $9,000 at the gallery.) As her craft advances, her domestic status improves. Husband Everett gradually assumes the Womans Work — sweeping, peeling, darning — so she can earn money with her art. Maud's art is gloriously naive. It springs from her wistful imagination more than from her actual environs. It's the triumph of spirit over perception. If it's representational it represents the figures teeming in her imagination not those actually outside and around. In rough parallel, she stays with vile Everett because she sees more in him, a softer self, than not only we see but that he himself doesn't sense. She dies knowing he loved her — despite his never having said anything like that, or shown it, or indeed ever acknowledging it even to himself. But the feeling does out, even if it's in the subtle shift from her walking behind him on the horizon line to him pushing her in his wheelbarrow. Love takes many forms. As does art. And marriage.Perhaps Everett's most loving act is taking her to espy her daughter, whom Maud's family took away and sold, telling her the baby had been deformed and died. The film's dominant palette is the grey gloom of cramped unlit interiors and a hard scrabble, penurious life. The fish seller makes so little that five cents for a painted card becomes a windfall. The point about that unrelieved darkness is Maud's response to it: flowers and animals painted in bright, unmodulated colours, a brilliance that her crippled hand uses to express her indomitable, spirited soul. Because she has spent her life in the shadows — from the shame of a humiliating pregnancy and helplessness to Everett's abused cleaner — she finds in art the joy and brightness of life. It proves contagious."
