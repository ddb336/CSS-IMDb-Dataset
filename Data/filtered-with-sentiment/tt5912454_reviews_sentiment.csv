",0.0,0.3127,2021-02-07 00:00:00,10,"In my one playwriting class in college, my teacher said when your two characters are talking a lot, make sure you fill in the rest with subtitle action because your audience will get bored. I find it interesting that the reviews for this movie go from 1 or 10, there is few in between. It's certain perspective. You either relate to the characters and feel their feels or you don't.I personally did. But I can see why some would think it's boring too because they can't emotionally connect. It doesn't make it a bad film which is honestly why I hate reviews. They are so subjective."
" Those were the days, my friend
",0.4939,0.8126,2021-01-18 00:00:00,10,"So many time-machine movies operate on the assumption you just twist a dial but Blue Jay takes you back and forward and back again like a needle dropped on an old lp record, oh that song, then lifted and dropped somewhere else, oh that song, oh and that one too, oh, then let to play on, mercilessly even, till the tears flow and the song reaches such a pitch of emotion that all it can do is play to the end, where nostalgia and reality meet for coffee.The acting is beyond acting here, the writing from the heart."
" First review ever, but this one is definetly worth it

I didn't even notice anything but them, the genuine chemistry they have, and then, at the end, I got it, why nothing else than those two was necessary at all to make this movie. Lights, sounds, songs, looks, moves, touch, everything is there, and I want it all. Okay now, if this doesn't make any sense, just watch it.
Thanks for the great team who made this incredibly both deep and light movie, I love it."

" How did this movie evade me all this time?!
",0.0,0.9808,2021-01-06 00:00:00,10,"High school sweethearts run into each other after 24 years, and end up spending the night together, mostly reminiscing the old days. It has no happy ending one would expect from a romantic movie, yet the viewer is left feeling oddly happy for the two characters. In real life, the choices you make cannot be fixed, no matter what you do after, and that is what the movie is about. Sometimes, some form of closure is far better than a fantasy happy ending that only lives in the imagination.Filming over 7 days with no real screenplay must have been both fun and challenging, and it comes across in the final product. Loved the choice of colours too (or lack of!), and the soundtrack is decent. One of the best low-budget indie movies out there. Here, take my rare 10/10 for that."

After I watched it the first time, I had to go back and watch certain scenes again... and within the week had watched it twice through... which is saying something considering the realities of work and life being as crazy as it is. Both leads are stunning in the performances they give and the way they convey emotion throughout the film. I'm adding this to my list of all time favorite films. Though I haven't experienced the same things this couple does, it is so relatable and hits home in so many ways. There is the essence of pure joy, dorky happiness mixed with serious struggles and unhealed pains from the past. Definitely worth a watch."
" Sweet
",0.4588,0.9796,2020-11-16 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed watching this movie. It was sweet and romantic, and I loved the chemistry between Sarah Paulson and Mark Duplass. The scene where Amanda talks about her abortion was heartbreaking, but she was a scared 16 year old who didn't know what else to do. I was hoping something magical would happen between Amanda and Jim. Like maybe Amanda would leave her husband for him and find out he was the one who she really loved. But...not all stories have happy endings.I wish they made more movies like this. This is extremely underrated."
" Black and white has never been this colorful.
",0.0,0.9949,2020-11-16 00:00:00,9,"Wow. Well, I was looking for a movie that would hit me like a ton of bricks, and I found it on accident. I started to go with an old favorite, but this popped out and caught my eye instead. I've been a fan of the Duplass brother's since way back in The Puffy Chair, mumblecore days. They've really managed to do indie movies the right way all this time, and now their films are all grown up.Mark Duplass not only plays one of the only two characters (across from Sarah Paulson) but he also wrote and produced this film. Paulson herself is the powerhouse she always is, of course. With this film, Mark really continues to prove that he's genuinely a master at not only writing, but acting with, genuine emotion and really pulling you into a thoughtful, heart-wrenching experience.Blue Jay is one of the most striking indie films I've seen in awhile. It was filmed sequentially over just 7 days. Instead of using a traditional camera set up, it's the first film shot entirely on Canon's high ISO ME2OF-SH, developed for military and security use. It looks like a black cube and is designed to capture HD-quality video in near-darkness. There's no built in power source or built in recording. The low light ability also allowed them the benefit of not having to use stage lights, and some scenes were filmed with as little light as LED's, lamps and other practical lighting, or even Christmas lights. The camera was also capable of inexpensively allowing them to get full framed close ups, without dealing with all the equipment and cost that would normally accompany that.In my opinion, this camera choice made Blue Jay a very unique stand out, especially compared to other recent indie films that are both louder and busier. It created a very rich, beautiful black and white that's been minimally processed after the fact.The film is peppered with beautiful shots, and the way Lehmann utilized the camera, you're pulled in close with Paulson and Duplass, it makes it very intimate and keeps you involved. There's not a boring moment, and you consistently feel as if you're right there.The absolute kicker for me, that completely left me stunned? That was reading after the fact that not only was this movie improvised, but it was Sarah Paulson's first time doing improv. There was no script. They were given a summary of the movie and their characters, and the rest was total improvisation. After reading interviews, many scenes had a few different tales, until they became comfortable enough with what they were going for to convey it the best way possible. In some instances, that meant parsing it down, such as when they're outside looking at the stars and they're saying very little but communicating so much.All of these things work together to make this film an absolute treasure to watch. I don't like going into the plot, especially because there's major spoilers if I were to do so. But suffice it to say that it's a rollercoaster. At first you're feeling kind of awkward along with the characters. Some time goes by and you feel them sinking into a comfortable space of nostalgia and taking you with them. A bit later and you're grinning ear to ear along as they are. Then suddenly, multiple times, there must have been dust kicked up in the room you're in, cause you're crying. The plot is just a whole ass punch in the gut, for many reasons at different times, but it's such a good hurt."
" More of this please
",0.4506,0.9728,2020-11-14 00:00:00,8,"Every once in a while you discover diamonds like this movie. Minimalistic, a script and just two actors who play their heart out. They have to be good because it is just them for every minute of the movie but boy do they succeed.Mark Duplass acting that conveys the loneliness that his character feels but still making it seem so natural. You just believe him and I think it is combination of good dialog and brilliant actors that you never actually think they are delivering lines. It feels very organic.Not to take away anything from Duplass but Sarah Paulson is carrying this. She is able speak just with facial expressions and looks. She will just change a look or tilt her head slightly and you will know what she thinks or wants to say and Duplass Character knows that to. In a way the audience is him trying to get as much as we can from the wonderful Amanda played by Sarah Paulson."

Lovely, lovely performance.What I didn't like:movies shot in black&white rarely do anything for me unless when they add meaning to my personal interpretation of the story. For this movie tho, it made it way too ponderous for my taste.Unsatisfying endings are not for me. And this one was one of the most unsatisfying endings ever. I get the significance, but it felt like a series finale cliffhanger."
" Self-indulgent, lazy and dull
",-0.6369,0.899,2020-10-26 00:00:00,1,"I love movies. They can excite, inspire, entertain, prompt thought and spark all kinds of intense feelings. Sadly, this one is just dull beyond belief and, for only the second time in my 64 years, I had to give up before the end. I recognise that the cognoscenti of the film world will mark me down as stupid, lacking in imagination or unable to accept an artistic challenge. However, I'm happy to put my head above that parapet and suggest that a more appropriate title for this dud might be 'The Emperor's New Clothes'."
" Technically superb make-up on flat characters and story
",0.6249,0.9689,2020-10-17 00:00:00,3,"Since the advent of colour film, filming in black and white is done to achieve specific artistic purposes. It can be done to set a mood, like in Schindler's List, or to mark a transition between the real and the strange, as in Stalker. Used right, it might even bring us closer to characters in a different era, as in the underrated Elisa y Marcela. But in Blue Jay, despite the undeniably superb technical and aesthetic quality, it comes off as pretentious, as an attempt to put on ""artsy"" make-up to pretend there is more to the story than there is.There is one fundamental question that all films - character studies in particular - need to answer: why should we care? Mark Duplass and Sarah Paulson are both accomplished actors and there are moments of great acting throughout the film, but ultimately we are left wondering why we should care about these two people in particular. We have all been the audience of ""you had to have been there"" stories - meaningful and funny to those involved, but impossible to convey to someone who was not. As high-school sweethearts Jim (Duplass) and Amanda (Paulson) chance upon each other in a supermarket twenty years after they both left town and embark on a day of silly reminiscing that evolves into play-acting ""what if we had stayed together"", I increasingly cannot shake the feeling that I am being told just such a story.The two actors improvise their way through an unscripted story of make-believe that hangs together sometimes by the thinnest of threads until we get to the big reveal: What happened those twenty years ago that broke Jim and Amanda up and why have they not spoken in all those years? Of course, that's what happens to most high-school sweethearts without any particular reason beyond life happening as it does to us all. But high schoolers finishing school and leaving town in different directions does not make a film so Blue Jay duly presents us with ... a cliché. And it is at this point that Duplass leaves any pretence of verisimilitude. Up to this point, all we have seen is progressively less believable play-acting, and so Duplass's Jim mostly comes off as emotionally stunted. And why should we care? The black-and-white cinematography feels more like a mist to mask how thin the story and the characters are than a way of enhancing an emotional impact that just is not there."

",-0.5423,0.9266,2020-05-22 00:00:00,1,"This could have been a great movie just because the idea is simple that we all can relate to and B&W was a nice touch.Plus we need more movies that aren't comics, shootouts and overall garbage mostly made for teenagers and China.But from the first scene it's awful and mostly because of the guy. I don't know anyone who would act like this because they don't exist...Could he have been a bigger dork? And jerk?
Nervous in his 40s to talk with an ex-girlfriend?But without a script and the actors (again, specifically the guy) able to pull this off, it's basically like watching someone else's home videos. Plug in a witty and talented actor (probably the director needs changing too) and this could be an intelligent and deep movie we'd love.I read there was no script but that's no excuse. Even Curb Your Enthusiasm, which is all improvised, has some structure.I'm about halfway through and feel like throwing up. If it improves I'll change this but I can't see that happening."

It released in Netflix in 2016; long time back. A lot of people who would've already seen it, can ignore this chota sa review. 😊This is an incredibly intimate film, in all the best ways. People often confuse intimacy with sex, so let me clear, I don't mean sex. There is a kiss and miss, but the words, and the emotions these two bring to life are deeper, and more meaningful than what some couples share in an entire life time. The chemistry is perfect, their interaction is superb as it burns you down and takes you back through memories of your life you once had. It was like sitting by a stream on a quiet summer day and letting the flowing water hypnotise and soothe you.There is nothing I didn't love about this wonderful film. There is a good possibility that people shall have some down time right now. :). I recommend spending it with #MarkDuplass and Sarah. You can hear their souls singing in their performances, and in his writing, and to me that makes Blue Jay a piece of art.The scope of #AlexLehmann's Blue Jay is humble, detailing not a great rectification of missed opportunity, but revealing instead in two unhappy people as they work through their longings in an extended duet.
Watch it, if you already haven't. 😊"

However, in contrast to other opinions here, for me Paulsons acting seemed a little light next to Marks. A bit too much of grown-up-woman-uses-plastic-smile-to-look-girly. She somehow couldn't make me believe her character fitted Marks once. But she very much made up for it in the final scenes when, let's say, the mood turns. That was a joy to watch.."

" Underappreciated is the kind of romantic movie in which the leading pair of love interests just talk
",0.8228,0.9913,2019-12-13 00:00:00,8,"Underappreciated is the kind of romantic movie in which the leading pair of love interests just talk. Nora Ephron and Rob Reiner are good and fine - they're definitive masters of the rom-com - but in my years of obsessive film watching have I found that nothing's more romantic to behold than voyeuristically watching as a connection between characters forms organically, no precious meet-cutes, no comedic misunderstandings, to deter the believability of the situation. Like Richard Linklater's ""Before ..."" trilogy and like this year's Michelle and Barack centered ""Southside With You,"" Alex Lehmann's ""Blue Jay,"" headed by the inimitable Sarah Paulson and the cultishly legendary Mark Duplass, is a romantic movie that reasons that beholding deep conversation is more carnal an action than anything sexy we've come to expect in the dependably rose-colored genre. In the film, Paulson (as Amanda) and Duplass (as Jim) are forty-something high school sweethearts that reunite by chance at a grocery store on a lazy afternoon. In the two decades since their breakup, neither has fulfilled the middle-aged prophecies they envisioned for themselves. Amanda married up and is a stepmother to a trio of kids nearing high school graduation. While her life seems ideal, a vision of suburban perfection, she worries about what'll happen when her nest is empty - she's dissatisfied and isn't so sure that she married her soulmate. Jim, by contrast, is doing much worse. Abidingly on the verge of erupting into a fit of tears, he's back in town to renovate the home of his late mother. Additionally unemployed and feasibly aimless, all he has to look forward to during the work week is the building of houses with his businessman uncle. But it's hardly his preferred line of work and he's bothered by the fact that everything he's come to understand about himself has all but shattered. Because Jim's immediately forthright with his emotions whereas Amanda lets notions of domestic bliss circle around her before she can't take it anymore, the film largely wallows in his unrequited longing, every smile and every laugh coated in a tangible melancholy, every revelation a bruiser. When the last twenty minutes arrive and it's divulged that Amanda, in fact, is not the unblemished woman she appears to be, and that the focal relationship is far more complex than meets the eye, ""Blue Jay"" metamorphoses from ""Before Midnight's"" soul sister to a visceral slice-of-life. In store is not a romantic comedy with optimism peeking around every corner but a relationship drama coated in sorrow, in desperation. It's a masterstroke in empathetic filmmaking, with Duplass's screenplay crucially naturalistic and Alex Lehmann's direction appropriately tender. One false, clichéd move and ""Blue Jay"" wouldn't work - it'd become an interesting, but manipulative, experiment in its genre. But everything about it feels unpredictable and unnervingly genuine, undoubtedly a result of Lehmann's knowing handling of the material and the masterful performances on the part of the luminous Paulson and the surprisingly moving Duplass. As its languid eighty minutes breeze by, its black and white photography enhancing its bittersweetness and its spotlessly placed instances of catharsis, ""Blue Jay"" proves itself to be among the most exciting independent films of 2016. It's mumblecore all grown up, an epilogue to the sweeping days Generation X reveled in. You can forget about your Meg Ryans and your Tom Hanks' here: fakery is nonexistent in ""Blue Jay,"" and our seeing of ourselves in Jim and Amanda only heightens its spellbinding hold over us."

It is not natural, it just feels awkward and pointless - it feels as though the actors are stumbling around awkwardly trying to find a thread in the narrative. Perhaps the director thought that would feel natural, but my feeling was that these people really don't know how to have a conversation.I couldn't watch the whole thing, lost interest in the characters and their story.

Also the vocabulary in this movie is ordinary so that we can empathize with it.De chemistry between both actors Mark Duplas playing Jim and Sarah Poulson playing Amanda is so sweet. You really feel their story, their laughter and their sadness. You might not relate with the story between them because it's quite special and unique. But somehow we can understand them. The words and sentences they say on particular scenes could be the same we would say in that type of situation.
Wich makes this movie so great. Mark Durglas did a good job writing this movie, aswell playing in it. He knows how to make akward situations or conversations that we might come into in our daily life.Overall, it's just a good indie movie. Where two people share an amazing (somehow) sad history.

And at other times, I felt like I was literally part of their conversations, laughing when they laughed etc. To me, the film had a strong ""play"" vibe - the kind of thing you'd see in a theater for some University's end-of-year final assessment.I was already a fan of Mark Duplass's work (though struggling to stop seeing him as the serial killer from ""Creep""), yet completely unfamiliar with Sarah Paulson - and whoah, she puts in one hell of a performance in this and I found her stealing the show in many scenes. Glad to discover her via this!Sometimes I became a little bored though, or found my mind wandering off into reflection of my own life. But ultimately I was always pulled back by a funny line or plot twist. The ending was a bit abrupt in my opinion, and this film won't be for everyone.

" Master Class in Acting

What follows is a painfully sweet and sad story about two people processing the regret they feel about giving up on something that might have been right, but who must move forward with the lives they have.Much of the ground covered in this film has been covered before, but so what? After all, there are only so many stories and themes out there for artists to explore. What matters are the particulars brought to any one telling, and that's where ""Blue Jay"" shines. Its improvisational, loosey-goosey vibe feels just right, and makes us feel like we're privileged insiders in this couple's story. Paulson and DuPlass don't miss a beat, and the final scene is a tour de force for both of them.I wasn't ready for this movie to end when it did, not because the ending felt misplaced, but because I wasn't ready to be away from these people. That's pretty high praise.Grade: A"
" A chance meeting of high-school sweethearts after many years
",0.7003,0.953,2018-12-14 00:00:00,7,"A chance meeting of high-school sweethearts brings back memories - some sweet, some bitter. He's back in town after the death of his mother and to sort out her house; she's home to visit her expectant sister.They meet, awkwardly, in a local store, have an awkward reunion coffee in the Blue Jay cafe which has lent the film its title, and by degrees return to his mother's house - a time capsule evocative of so much of their past.The film starts slowly, and the script is spare. To me, the many pauses and the awkward moments are perhaps a little overplayed. There are also little interludes giving us glimpses of (black and white) scenery and a sense of place and of memories. It's often unkind to praise the settings, but these were beautiful, as was the immense period detail of the mother's house. Here, they eventually move to a slightly confusing and unlikely role play as if they had married and were now reaching their twentieth wedding anniversary.Sarah Paulson plays Amanda with tenderness and poise. She is perhaps a little hardened by her life experiences and her marriage. Mark Duplass, who is also the film's writer, plays Jim, a sensitive man who seems to have drifted rather into what feels like a lonely and uncomfortable career choice in renovating houses. He sports a beard which, to me, wasn't a good thing.I have to say I was sorely tempted to give up on the film at the 40 - 50 minute stage, but towards the end, the pace picks up and the story starts to make more sense and feel a lot more worthwhile. There is a genuine message and I think it was worth the wait. 6.5/10"

The first line of the song is "" I saw my old lover in the grocery store"". This is the first scene of the movie.

Sarah Paulson gives a great performance and many scenes are very enjoyable. Everything was set up for there to be a serviceable or good movie by the end but a couple key scenes ruined the believability for me. The reveals could have been interesting but they only further enforced the lack of realistic character interaction. Mark Duplass (I think that's his name) gave a decent performance with many subtle anxious ticks and good line delivery up until he has to deliver real emotion at the climax of the film, it was almost laughable."

Their encounter takes place in the same house as many of their previous encounters, providing a perfect backdrop to traverse their past. As this develops, they shift from an initially superficial, floating dialogue to an increasingly emotional and intense interaction, with many varied emotional peaks and valleys along the way. It's mostly interesting and engaging, although some of it lingered in silly/sappy territory too long for my taste. It's not really a serious movie as a whole, more like a piece they would do to practice their acting range and have some fun; still fairly fun to watch though."

" Interesting, but not exciting
",-0.3802,0.9904,2018-05-13 00:00:00,8,"I used ReelGood's Netflix roulette to find a movie to watch, and my only disappointment with this movie is from the fact that the genre I selected was ""Thriller"" which this most definitely was not. I kept expecting some sort of mystery or twist that would make this drama into a thriller, and it never came, but I'm still glad I watched it because this film was one of the rare movies that doesn't enlist tons of predictable cliches. The story follows former high school sweethearts as they reconnect after twenty years. The residual feelings between the two characters are evident right away and throughout the film you watch those feelings spark and rekindle. A typical hollywood romance would find an easy out of the predicament that Amanda is married, like her husband is negligent or abusive, but this movie doesn't do that. Instead, even though because of their chemistry and palpable desire you want to see them reconnect physically, you also don't because of the moral issues regarding her marriage. Though the final revelation that the couple was driven apart following an abortion is predictable in the moments leading up to it, the scene is still incredibly relatable. Everything about this story feels authentic and engaging. Though it is not terribly exciting, it is realistic. Even Jim's foolish notion that had Amanda not gone through with the abortion the couple could have been so happy together is genuine and understandable, given that people who are disappointed with their lives often think if one thing could have gone differently in their lives, they may have had the perfect life they fantasize about--even though if what they wanted to happen had, they would ultimately have found the fantasy still unattainable. The story, characters, and emotions were so real, so even though the movie wasn't thrilling, it was still beautiful and interestingly complex."

" An achingly poignant yet beautiful powerhouse
",0.5994,0.9945,2018-03-08 00:00:00,9,"The story of Jim and Amanda, two former high-school sweethearts who reunite by chance some years later, is told and performed with such passion and honesty by the very grounded and talented Mark Duplass and Sarah Paulson.The vulnerability these actors no doubt felt due to working from no more than a summarised outline and having to improvise the rest - often times drawing inspiration from their personal lives - comes through and serves the film well in perfecting the authentic nature of their characters and interactions.Something I didn't expect with Blue Jay was how much it would make me laugh and smile. The humour and heartfelt moments came about so naturally and effortlessly, not to mention consistently. This allowed for easy involvement and echoing of feelings, sending me from smiling to laughing to crying all within minutes.The creative choice of black and white lends itself well by keeping the focus on the story and characters, at the same time adding a notable atmosphere of nostalgia that highlights and complements Jim and Amanda's reflections on past joys and, more truthfully, present disillusionment.The direction and cinematography of Alex Lehmann, and the dedication and love for this small independent project from the rest of the cast and crew - especially Duplass, who has managed to achieve what most creators wish they could, and with less than half the time and budget - pours onto the screen, through the screen, and into your heart.Blue Jay is filmmaking and storytelling at its finest; a real piece of poetry."
" Two dull and awkard ex-lovers
",-0.4019,0.5862,2018-02-23 00:00:00,2,"I confess upfront that I have no idea who Marc Duplass is and if I should be impressed in any way. I just selected this movie hoping in a decent story, since I am a big fan of the ""Before"" trilogyThe two main (an basically only) characters in the story are Jim and Amanda, ex high-school sweethearts who meet after 20 year. They both moved out of their small town. Jim is back because his mum died and Amanda because her sister is pregnant.They take a walk down memory lane, starting with a coffee at the Blue Jay of the title and from there on their conversation veers from awkward to boring, to bizarre and back to boring again.Turns out it is not so easy to write and perform lines that seem improvised but are actually carefully scripted. While in the ""Before"" movies conversation flows beautifully and the actors seem to have a connection, here Jim is plain weird. He is also a liar and keeps touching his beard (which is very annoying).Amanda also lies, but I guess it's normal that neither would admit their lives are not turning out that great. Still, the tape with their super-weird conversation register 20 years previously sounds like a mega fake. Honestly, who would register anything like that?It just get worse with the role play that follows. Everything looks staged and fake and the leads have zero chemistry. Good black & white photography, though."
" A small story told with love

The screenplay is there to be followed but it seems everyone could write it or even the actors during the shot could amend it with the director and screenplay writer approval to changes because of this is a simple story like a children tale that everyone could pass through: a kind of archetypical tale. Back to the film, it is indeed simple, simple scenarios, black and white, good performances. The story drags you into your own story or someone else from your college. The film invites you to listen old love stories in old houses. There you see the characters finding remembrances, old notes, and letters, secrets, grievances buried in a pile of years. A man and woman in a search of life meaning came across each one way a second time to inquire about what the best track from now on. Good cinema, , a never-ending theme to be explored by a sensitive filmmaker. Great film!"
" Bittersweet
",-0.0772,0.9918,2017-12-27 00:00:00,10,"As a person fuelled by emotions that I increase and trasform into a hurricanes inside my soul, I claim: this film gives you a magical experience of living through strong emotions. The issue is not about just me being an impressible spectator. It's about having no expectations for the film and then receiving amazement and pleasant satisfaction after watching it.These are the reasons why:1. Actors: I know Sarah Paulson as a good dramatic actress, so I expected a good performance from her. But still I am impressed about how versatile she is, turning from silly behaviour to feeling pain and sadness in 1 second. I haven't seen Mark Duplass before, but he left a rewarding experience. Sometimes I thought that he was overacting, but then I recalled my thought about men: they are just as children when it comes to emotional expression. So, who knows, maybe his acting was natural.2. Script: Mark Duplass took on the role of script writer too. Though, wait, there was no script to this film. I think it helped actors to wear their roles as own faces and transformed this film into well-shot POV taken from characters' archieve. Of course, the plot is not forward-looking. But the final makes me feel happy, because even if it is more or less obvious what is going to be next, we don't know what is to happen after the last glance. 3. Picture: The visual component of the film is gorgeous. It is that situation, when the black & white imagery is totally appropriate (it's like a retrospective in the present: old feelings are experienced after 20 years). The cameraman worked well with the view. As a result, the whole film is a visual bliss.4. Style: What is that wins over in this film is the style, which is fully matured. Starting with the clothes of the main characters (thanx costume designers for the mix of a coat, a knitted cap and a dress with a bright flower pattern) to the interior of Jim's house, from the music to the silence (even the silence is underlining the style). Everything looks beautiful, languishing and luscious, as a red-ripe fig.5. Soundtrack: Did you notice it? I didn't. Idon't know if it is good or bad. But it inflooded the narration, and it is good. All in all, this film infected me with feelings, and now I have a lot to go through for the next hours or even days.10/10"

Its simplicity — yet, followed by its simultaneous complexity to deal with the relationship of the couple whose story it tells us — makes it worth every minute. I was fascinated by the difference noticed in the characters' behaviors from the first scene, when they run at each other for the first time in 20 years at the market, to the last one, when they smile at each other as a sign of goodbye. Besides its ""genuine"" atmosphere, the fact that it was composed with basically two characters gave it a particularly intimate ambiance. Oh, and I couldn't forget to mention the tender black and white effect, which, together with the nice photography, amazed me during the whole movie. So sensitive!"
" Inexcusable
",0.0,-0.8813,2017-04-02 00:00:00,1,"I do not understand how anyone could give this bad excuse a ""10."" Mark Duplass, who has some talent, owes an apology to all filmmakers who struggle to make their art. This exercise in bad judgment and self-indulgence is atrocious. As may be commonly known, there was no script for this film. That is painfully obvious as we watch Sarah Paulson, an otherwise fine actress, fake her way through this, following Mark Duplass's meandering lead. If we cared about these people and wanted to have an intimate look at their lives, this might have been a touching film. But because neither of them gave me any reason to care, all I could do was sit and watch in slack-jawed amazement. Sarah (as Amanda) and Mark (as Jim) stumble into each other at a supermarket after apparently not seeing each other for 20 years. Although Sarah has purchased ice cream for her sister, in addition to other items, she agrees to join Mark for a coffee at a place called the ""Blue Jay."" This cafe does not have any other importance in the film and begs the question, ""Why was this film called 'Blue Jay'?"" We follow Sarah back to Mark's mother's house as he attempts to pack it up after her death. During this process, we understand that Sarah and Mark have history, and as the film unfolds, they have a fantasy moment of what their lives would have been like had they remained together. Although I will allow that there were several sweet moments during their imagining of ""what if,"" we had to endure endless stupidity having to do with them both doing ""rap"" music, making stupid sounds, doing stupid dances, and making up stupid dialogue. Again, if these two individuals were deeply engaging, I would have happily followed their story. Perhaps because I wanted a STORY (and not some out- of-control blabber-fest that felt like: Let's hit this point about 15 minutes in; let's hit the next point about 30 minutes in, ad nauseam...), it was hard to invest myself emotionally in the lives of two people that actually could have been interesting. Things get borderline maudlin with the discovery of ""the letter that was never sent"" and the ""confession"" from both sides about the ""tragedy that should have never happened."" I'm sorry; for all of Mark's Oscar-winning (in his mind) crocodile tears, I didn't buy his performance for a minute. He seemed like a first-class wimp, a crybaby, an emotionally stunted a**hole who was apparently incapable of manning up for over 20 years and was, I guess, going to go on and live in anger and denial till the day he died instead of coming to terms with the past. Yes, there are people like that... and in the hands of a qualified actor, I would have felt those things. But Mark has a certain detachment about him that makes him come across as a failed stand-up comic or a serial murderer -- it's hard to tell. Bottom line: I could not like him. Sarah fared better, but because she spent the majority of the film under an absolutely ghastly ski cap, even her Hollywood smile couldn't help her in the wardrobe department. As another reviewer said, it seemed that the Duplass Brothers (or whoever was involved in this amateur 80 minutes) scored a camera (and Sarah) for the weekend and said, ""You know what? Why the hell not?"" And so... they made this mistake. I do not think it was brave or fresh or emotionally moving. I always felt that they were just about reaching for straws as they tried to ""improvise"" what they were going to say next. The further along it went, the more Mark dropped in my estimation (and I actually liked him in ""Your Sister's Sister.""). He said at the beginning that his face ""leaked"" -- ""Leaked?"" Give me a break; was that supposed to be funny? By the time he really was supposed to be crying (and I'm sure he thought he was brilliant), I was looking for my barf bag. Last, who on earth goes around by the name of ""Waynie"" ? It's amazing that the prod co managed to press Clu Gulager into service as the manager of a liquor store. He actually seemed real and I would have much rather heard his story. But why did they have to name him ""Waynie""? I found it borderline vulgar and insulting. Sorry, I went into this with an open mind, struggled to get through it, found a few entertaining moments, maybe even a twinge of sadness during Mark's big ""breakdown,"" but over all, this is like a demo of what the film COULD be following the FIRST draft of a screenplay. There could have been a much more polished version of it if some thought had been applied instead of saying, ""Yeah, hell, sure, let's go for it."" Throughout the whole film, I kept asking my husband, ""But what about the ice cream that she bought for her sister?"""

But also how that isn't reality (reality is in color). The ending doesn't drive this home for me. It's rushed and malformed. We know something is coming, but what and how has it impacted them?

Flirting with the lines of danger and further heart-break, the two characters learn about each other's lives and the story blossoms from the dialogue. It is simply written, well directed as Lehmann's debut, and Mark Duplass was very convincing in his role. It leaves a bittersweet taste throughout, as the undertone is soaked with regret and deep sadness, where on the outside, cavalier attitudes and laughter are rampant. Blue Jay has plenty of sweet and loving moments, but that underlying tone of poor life choices is the nail on the coffin, and the reason why this film is so beautifully bittersweet."

Here is a film so honestly made that it will make your heart melt. Blue Jay is essentially a two handler about two former high school lovers who bump into each other for the first time in two decades.It is an awkward situation at first. But soon it develops into a very memorable day for the both of them. There are moments of immense joy and pain as they revisit their past through their present. It's like experiencing catharsis. Indie films, when they are really good, can really pack a punch because they are not bound by the liability to placate the Studio bosses, thereby allowing greater liberty to the filmmaker. And, Blue Jay is a very well made indie film and certainly one of the better indies that I have ever seen.One of the greatest strengths of the film are the acting performances of Mark Duplass and Sarah Paulson. The two of them look so natural (the choice monochrome of course helps... color would have drastically toned down the intensity). Both the actors demonstrate a great range of emotions. Duplass looks the more volatile of the two but it is as per the demand of the character. As for Paulson, her smile seems capable of speaking a thousand words. Together, they create magic, which, I daresay, most Hollywood A- listers fail to create these days. The film has its share of flaws but overall it makes for a wonderful movie viewing experience. If you are a hopeless romantic then this film is certainly for youFor more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges""."

I got this film for free and I must say that I feel a bit guilty for it. It heralds joy and nostalgia and reality in subtle measures. It is beautifully crafted; I think shooting in black and white was a strophe. I usually avoid b & w but I think it complimented the tone and the titillation here. The chemistry between the two main actors speaks of colour.I will buy this film or it will pass like a mandala.Either way, It is quietly beautiful, I hope someone reading this can enjoy it in new ways."
