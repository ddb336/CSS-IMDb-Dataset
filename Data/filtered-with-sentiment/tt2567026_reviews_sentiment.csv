" Avoid.
",-0.296,-0.1779,2021-04-05 00:00:00,2,"I won't lie, I didn't finish this film. I made it about half an hour in and then turned it off. It's boring. So, so boring. Do yourself a favour and watch something else instead."
" Not Too bad.
",0.431,0.9354,2021-03-23 00:00:00,5,"I would say that the first release of Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland was far better. I got the vibe that this sequel was more concentrated on visual effects rather than the storyline.To me the acting in this film (although not bad) was more ""flat"" than that of the original. When Alice returned to Wonderland, the reactions from it's inhabitants kind of gave me a fake feeling of ""oh my God! It's Alice."" There's just not a lot of emotion in the acting when you compare the movie to the original.The visual effects of the film are stunningly gorgeous. It's kind of a debate to me whether I'd let very young youth view it, due to some fantasy violent storytelling visuals, but it is a family film nonetheless. I would probably say ages 9+ in my opinion. This is just my opinion.Overall, the movie is decent and I rated it while comparing it to the original at a mid level. If you liked the first film, it's definitely worth a watch. 5/10"

",0.0,-0.3392,2021-03-21 00:00:00,3,"What was that I just saw? The movie was totally unrealistic and I do not mean in ""wonderland"" way.. more in the way ""what the heck am I just watching"" way... I think I completely missed the point.. Alice is really annoying.. the only character I liked was actually Iracebeth :D.. I think she was played perfectly.. but the effects while traveling in time, the ridiculous scenes and dialogues, the time stopping... ehm... too much..."
" Nick of Time
",0.0,-0.9799,2021-03-18 00:00:00,5,"A sequel nobody wanted, to a film that was successful,l but unloved, and at a time when it's star was at one of his lowest points. . . can't wait.Alice (Mia Wasikowska) now a successful explorer and ship's captain, returns to wonderland, via a mirror to discover that the Mad Hatter (John Depp) is in a state of extreme depression regarding the apparent death of his family. Alice resolves to borrow the Chronosphere from Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) and use it to investigate what happened to them. Time refuses to give her the device, which Alice then steals and begins a quest back through the history of her friends, with Time in pursuit.A change of director for the sequel, but it's essentially in name only as Tim Burton has established the tone and look of the films that James Bobin, of ""The Muppets Movie"" fame, continues with. That tone and look is of course ""whimsy"". WHIMSY BY THE BUCKETLOAD. All the forced whimsy that you can possibly manage. And it's all the more boring for it. With the possible exception of Alice, I don't like these characters, even the ones I'm supposed to root for, like the White Queen and the Hatter. They seem like terrible, infuriating people to actually spend time with. It feels like a movie that everyone involved made because they were contractually obliged too, and not because they actually wanted too.The only bit of the film I do like is the character of Time. I like that he's not a traditional villain, given that he really needs the chronosphere to keep time going and is actually trying to save the world but also I liked that Cohen played him as if he was channelling Werner Herzog, which I found constantly amusing.With a gun to my head, I might suggest that I liked this more than the original - but genuinely like it, I did not."
" Better than the first
",0.4404,0.6322,2021-02-23 00:00:00,6,"There's really nothing that special going on in this movie. The CGI was standard as well as the acting. This movie does have more heart than it's predecessor, which is something that normally doesn't happen with these types of sequels, so I was pleasantly surprised at that.
Give it a watch if you like. It's interesting enough to keep your attention, but forgettable enough that you can move on from it immediately after."
" It's a kids' movie, alright
",0.25,0.8457,2021-02-16 00:00:00,4,"This was a bore packed with some pretty effects. However, not pretty enough to distract you from everyone's horrible acting and script that was cliched nonsense, full of sentences that seem to be taken from ""Generator prompt list"" or somewhere similar.Alice was annoying in this. As a main character, her one job, in the absence of plot, was to lead the story and help it move forward. Instead, we were stuck with whiny, self-righteous babbling Barbie with Turkish/Indian TV inspired tendency to think aloud.Real star and protagonist of this movie was Time. He is just simple guy doing his job who wants to be left alone because he has seen it all, and I respect that. If they really wanted to do something original with this sequel, they should have named it Time vs Babbling Barbie and make it all about him fighting the thief who, for her own selfish reasons, threatens to destroy everything. Rating for that movie wouldn't be better than the rating for this one, but at the very least it would be one of those movies you don't mind rewatching every decade or so (which is more than I can say for Alice Through the Looking Glass). As for Red Queen, even though I don't understand why they tried so hard to give her and her actions background, she once again triumphs over her sister as a far superior character.To sum it all up, it's perfectly fine for the kids aged 0-12 to watch this movie as it bores you to death with stories about friends, and love and what not, but anyone older than that would be better off with something else."
" A visual show based on a feeble script, where the cast tried without success and the director did not demand much.
",-0.5897,0.9953,2021-02-09 00:00:00,6,"There are some films that are made only for the money that is expected to be collected from them. After seeing this film, I think it fits that description. ""Alice in Wonderland"" was a box office and critical hit, and had a good financial fit. The sequel, expected, takes advantage of the title of a novel that Lewis Carroll wrote after ""Alice in Wonderland"". Just the title! The story has nothing to do with the book that, out of curiosity, turned 145 years in the year the film was released.The script begins with Alice's return from a trip to the Chinese seas and the discovery that her mother had gone into debt and passed control of the family firm to Hamish who, by malice, decided to take revenge by forcing her to sell her ship. It's in this context that Alice returns to the magical country that she already knows after going through a mirror. There, she discovers that she was ""summoned"" to the country to help the Mad Hatter, who is dying of sadness for believing that his entire family, presumably dead, may be alive somewhere. Alice will have to go to the Castle of Time and get the Chronosphere, a time-travel machine that would allow her to discover what happened to the Hatter's family.I was unimpressed with this film. I think the direction of James Bobin bet a lot on the visual and little on the script. In fact, I found surprising that Burton did not stay with the direction and preferred to stay in production. I think it would have been better for the film to have Burton in the chair. Linda Woolverton's script seemed to be predictable and not very creative, with childish's dialogues, forced jokes and too many puns that fade over time. The material given to the actors was probably not the best either.Mia Waskikowska is quite good as Alice, she looks safe and confident. Helena Bonham Carter gave soul and emotion to a character who was, therefore, very humanized. Sacha Baron Cohen is also in good shape and this is reflected in the inspired and fun way he brought Time to life. I bet he had fun with the character and did this job with pleasure, I got to feel it when I saw him. However, if we put aside these three actors who, in fact, did very well, the cast's performance is generally poor. Johnny Depp, for example, was a shadow of himself, and he is one of those actors that I consider almost a safe bet for fantastic characters. I believe that the bad phase he was going through at the time of filming had a strong influence (the stormy divorce with Amber Heard), but the bad material of the script did not help him either. Anne Hathaway was also bad in a lifeless, emotionless performance, as if she was not engaged in her work. The film also features Rhys Ifans, Geraldine James, Lindsay Duncan and Leo Bill, but they all seem to be adrift, doing as they see fit and without much support from the director. The voice actors, as their characters, were in the third place of importance, highlighting only the very brief contribution of Allan Rickman because it was his last work.Technically, the film is great, as its predecessor had previously been. These are films with a great visual focus, and where a lot of money is invested in CGI and state-of-the-art effects. The result is what is calculated: a visual show with a colorful, vibrant and intense cinematography. The effects of the storm at sea and the maritime maneuvers of Alice's ship were very well done and the fantastic world of Wonderland looks incredible, although not as absurd as Carroll's imagination would have liked, I think. This is compensated by the Castle of Time, as extravagant as possible. The costumes also help, starting with Time's and the two queens (I didn't like Alice's oriental costume so much, I confess). Still a word for the good conception of the Seconds and, particularly, of the guard of the Red Queen, inspired by the magnificent art of Arcimboldo, who is one of my favorite artists of the Renaissance period. Whoever has never seen one of his artworks must see it. As for Danny Elfman's soundtrack, I think it meets expectations, but it doesn't stand out."
" discouraging story,and fails with characters
",-0.6908,-0.9571,2021-02-04 00:00:00,4,"With a disheartening story, bad and terrible narratives, characters with bad performances, the film miserably fails plots of your characters."
" I liked it!
",0.4753,0.9632,2021-02-02 00:00:00,9,"Dispite all the negative reviews, i liked it every minute! Great artwork, great special effects, beautiful colors! A movie doesn't allways have to be a great story!"
" James Bobin's direction and the less eccentric suitability of this world worked for me making the experience of watching the film quite fun and enjoyable
",0.7755,0.9985,2021-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Linda Woolverton, one of the most traditional Disney screenwriters, returns to the role to work again with the characters created by Lewis Carroll, but it is very wrong to think that the adaptation of Alice in the Country of Mirrors is faithful. Woolverton's work follows the line of the previous text: totally free for creation. However, despite the studio betting on the screenwriter's imagination, she delivers a hot pocket script - the basics of the most basic, yet fun and fleeting. Lewis Carroll's book features crazy characters in a fantastic universe and the author gives even more depth to this world through nonsense poems. Alice Through the Looking Glass at Disney - directed this time by James Bobin - pulls any magic out of that place by explaining the insanity (and obsession with tea) of the characters and by summarizing all the conflicts in the film to family problems. In a universe as rich as Wonderland, trying to sum up all problems to topics as mundane as death and family makes the whole fantastic world lose its wonderful characteristics and become a mirror of our world, just including a palette of more vibrant colors.Alice Through the Looking Glass, like her predecessor, has very few references in the book. In this new story, the protagonist must race against time (literally against Time) to find out what happened to the Mad Hatter's family. Meanwhile, in the ""real"" world, Alice faces family problems and an oppressive society that believes that the fact that she is a woman makes her unable to run her father's business. Bobin and Woolverton manage to present a film that, while bringing interesting questions about time and in a small dose, the role of women in society, also amuses, entertains and is much more dynamic than its predecessor. Alice is a young, single, independent woman, commanding a boat, overcoming storms and beating pirates. She wears what she wants, not caring if she is going to shock someone, and she also challenges men of the time, refusing to be treated as incapable just because she is a woman, and rebelling against diagnoses of ""female hysteria"", something common in it was Victorian, a period in which the feature takes place. All the scenes of Alice in our world are much more unbelievable and inspiring than any minute she spends on the other side of the mirror trying to save the Hatter. Unfortunately, the feature is not called Alice Being Incredible in the Real World. The young woman spends very little time in her own reality and much of what we see on the big screen is precisely this Wonderland created by James Bobin.Taking the place of Tim Burton in the direction, the difference in pitch brought by James Bobin is felt immediately. Its action is more imaginative, the camera has a more participative and creative role, the atmosphere is lighter, the characters are less affected mainly by the White Queen and the Mad Hatter making them more pleasant and relevant within the film. The framings are rich, knowing very well how to fill the massive presence of the chroma key that brings life to Wonderland. Bobin also works with point of view issues more gracefully when Alice changes size on the journey. In fact, there is even a very expensive sequence plan during the explosive climax of the film that can well illustrate the sense of urgency, adventure and magic that perpetrated at the end of the journey.There is no great effort to build this story. The main highlight is the use of time travel that Alice performs with the aid of an apparatus of the pseudo-antagonist Tempo. In addition, the lighter and less somber tone than seen in Burton's film makes the tape much more enjoyable for the general public. Linda knows how to inject energy into the story whenever necessary. That is, at least three big twists manage to change the direction of the narrative taking it to even unexpected places in a select scene, very fast, but courageous for inferring such a vibrant contrast between the raw real world with that of the impossible imagination of Wonderland. .However, even with this curious twist in one of the twists, Woolverton weighs heavily on the use of clichés that end up making the film quite predictable, in addition to the expository verbiage that insists on explaining many obvious things - Alice is the one who most explains the film to the audience. Many relationships between new characters cannot escape this and many of the others even behave as mere supporting characters. The development on the journey, done properly, is restricted solely and exclusively to the family drama of the Queen of Hearts with the White Queen. Even though the Hatter's bow and his family are the driving force of the whole film, it is somewhat uncomfortable that it can be resolved with some ease, all by magic. With it, there is at least one interesting dramatic exercise on the narrative use of an item related to the character's childhood - even if it gives rise to yet another cliché conflict.The drama of the two sister queens does not escape from an already known structure or even a common question: ""If you had the opportunity to go back in time, would you prevent the existence of some genocidal tyrant?"". Obviously, because it is a children's film, this is very appeased and mixed with humor. Still with the interesting theme in this nucleus, it is sometimes better to leave stories of origin under the rugs. What Woolverton brings to explain the motivation for the Queen of Hearts' evil is, let's say, wasted. In fact, the motivation problems in the first film are practically solved here. Alice, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, White Queen and Time have reasons, albeit weak, to act in favor of advancing the narrative. Tempo, unfortunately, is a weak character, of a single note, although the interpretation of the always cartoonish Sacha Baron Cohen gives energy to his mad pursuit against Alice. The script is quite contradictory in the repetitive phrases he says about being immortal when clearly, throughout the film, he loses strength. It can even be seen as an irony or a mocking speech about arrogance, but as the character does not learn during the journey, it is difficult to defend the rickety treatment. In fact, the Queen of Hearts' relocation in this adventure is strange and a little out of place after being banned in the previous film. Woolverton has little interest in explaining this to the public.Technically, the film matches Tim Burton's film. The visual effects and creatures are magnificent once again. Taking advantage of this journey before, during and after the Queen of Hearts' reign, Bobin, photographer Stuart Dryburgh and production designer Dan Hennah hit the nail on the head in this film's impeccable look. From the gloomy conception full of Gothic architecture crammed with clocks in the palace of Time to the heyday of a more cheerful, lively and colorful Wonderland. Highlight, of course, for the tea table, now impeccable as it should be with full sweets and cakes, shiny silverware and refined porcelain escaping Burton's defeatist and depressed conception. This attention to detail with the visual and art direction is what really elevates the film. Even though Dryburgh does not risk creating visual metaphors that run away from the basics, the diverse color palette is praiseworthy, in addition to the more inspired lighting using demarcated backlights to create true ""painted"" plans on the canvas - an example of this is where Tempo controls the clocks. ""Life"" of every citizen of the magical world.The cast weighs a lot in favor of the work. Wasikowska is forced to say regrettable phrases - ""How will I live without the impossible? ""-, but she doesn't abandon her character, which gives the least credibility to the worlds that surround her. The actress seems to have learned a lot since 2010 and delivers an Alice with more personality and much more charisma than we saw previously. Helena Bonham Carter, who returns as Queen of Hearts, and Sacha Baron Cohen, who debuts as Time, are the only ones capable of entertaining the long way to the end of the film, easing the uncomfortable insistence on Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter. Entitled to family drama, the character takes center stage to make the other inhabitants of Wonderland his luxury troupe, including Anne Hathaway's White Queen and Alan Rickman's ultimate work as the former Blue Caterpillar.Alice Through the Looking Glass is an unimaginative film that tries to answer questions that have never been asked. The only plausible reason for this continuation to exist is a response to the success achieved in the first feature. Perhaps all the disasters in the film that happen in Alice's fight against Time could have been avoided if Alice in the feature had heard a phrase from the protagonist of Lewis Carroll's book, in which the little girl says that there is no use going back to yesterday, because even so she was a different person. Anyway, this is a product that brings a little more of it, but full of charisma. Bobin's direction and the less eccentric suitability of this world worked for me making the experience of watching the film quite fun and enjoyable. However, even so, the weak script takes away the technical brilliance. For children, it is still a great choice, after all it is a quick, easy and harmless entertainment. And very expository."

HOWEVER there is something so freeing about this movie and the way the actors and director pay homage to the stories written by Lewis Carroll ESPECIALLY Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. I find that my heart absolutely melts and identifies with the vulnerability he can portray with just one single look. I find the mad hatter relatable and a lot easier to understand in this rendition rather than Disney's animated version. It's no surprise though- Tim Burton always delivers unique and quirky films that have this way of comforting the beast we call our mind- and I must say, that this is no exception."
" Solid film
",0.1531,0.9893,2020-11-16 00:00:00,7,"A step down from the 2010 film, but 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' is a solid film nonetheless.I enjoyed seeing this plot, largely about time, play out. The film is CGI heavy, but does look great for the vast majority. The cast are good, with Mia Wasikowska leading well and surrounded by the likes of Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.I do think the film could've been slightly shorter, with better pacing and less emphasis on the 'real world' stuff featuring Alice. The looking glass entry isn't as interesting/magical as the rabbit hole, also.Far superior to the 1998 adaptation of this 1871 Lewis Carroll novel, that's for certain."

I love Alice in Wonderland - In fact I love most fairy tale/fantasy movies. With the first Tim Burton Alice movie I wasn't disappointed, but the story took me by surprise. The same goes for this movie. But the surprise for me was that I really enjoyed this movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, so I went in not expecting much - and though the story line was a little bland - It was nice to see what became of Alice - Also in this movie, you learn things about people you didn't know. Such as the White and Red Queen's childhood. Take a step through the looking glass and follow Alice through an adventure to save The Mad Hatter's family - In a race to turn back time, Alice goes on another adventure and learns some things that cannot change the past, but can change the present."
" A film lacking Tim Burton's flair from the original.
",0.3182,0.9987,2020-10-31 00:00:00,6,"This film was very entertaining as someone who was interested in the sequel to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. It lacks the Tim Burton touch, but it still hangs on its own. If something has remained a constant in these two films is that the cinematographies are gorgeous, with every trip to Wonderland looking colorful and like paintings. The third act impressed me when I thought Wonderland would be doomed, but it didn't happen. The visual effects in the third act are a masterclass, and I'm impressed they didn't get nominated for an Oscar like the original.
In conclusion I liked this film a lot. If you like time travel stories, I don't think you will be insanely disappointed by this film, unless you don't like the fantasy from this franchise. Mia Wasikowsa still remains, in my opinion, magnificently cast as Alice. The supporting characters have less time (pun intended) to work with on this film, and that's a letdown compared to the original in which they were better. Overall, this movie felt like a spinoff for Alice and the Mad Hatter since they are the core of the story and nothing else. It is a letdown compared to the original, because it lacks Tim Burton's flair but still manages to be entertaining thanks to the colorful world, the lead in Mia Wasikowska, and great visual effects. This movie is slightly worse than the original so I give this film a 6.5/10. I gave the original a 7/10, because the art direction was just so beautiful and it was one of the Oscar wins that it desevedly won thanks to Tim Burton's vision. I really wish this movie had been a better success with it not making almost anything from the budget, compared to the original making a billion on the box office. It still manages to be entertaining so give it a shot if interested."

" Waste of Time
",-0.4215,0.3646,2020-08-14 00:00:00,1,"Disney's sequel to 2010's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Alice Through the Looking Glass,"" as with its predecessor, has very little in common with Lewis Carroll's classic books. There's an alternate world occupied by some creatures with partially-shared names, including a female (a woman here instead of a child) named Alice falling down a rabbit hole before and, now, going through a mirror. The similarities mostly end there. Not only is this Disney series evidently not really inspired by its literary source, it's antithetical to it. Where there was charm and wit in the books, there is none here. A place where characters were less important than what they represented is turned into a void where what's represented is only characters. Episodic and cleverly-constructed nonsense is replaced with hackneyed journey plotting. Enjoyment unsaddled by sentiment and a moral, here, becomes a cloying morality tale about the importance of family with an obnoxious musical score that's always keeping the audience attuned to what they're supposed to be feeling. This is one of the most vile big-budget, major-studio productions I've seen in some time.Even the CGI animation merely looks expensive rather than imaginative or impressive. The shots of Time chasing after Alice in the ""cronosphere"" (yeah, it's pretty stupid) look especially dreadful--static green-screen stagings that the illusion of movement by animated vortexes can't conceal. The ""cronosphere"" time machine itself looks like a gyroscopic mix between the prop from the 1960 ""The Time Machine"" with the flying capability of the ""Back to the Future"" DeLorean and a toilet. The clockwork stuff doesn't even look as good as what one could find in the first two ""Hellboy"" movies. Even the mirror motif is junk--a vestigial leftover from Carroll's original story.More so than even in the last movie, Alice is turned into a corporate marketing tool to profit from piggybacking on socially-progressive issues. Never mind, I guess, that this Alice is a colonialist--a ship captain for a Victorian-age trading company just back from opening up China for the imperial West. I've never thought much of the claim made by others that Carroll's books have a secret message regarding drugs, but Disney has done quite an inept job of things to tie Alice to the Opium trade.And who in their right mind wants to know the backstories of Wonderland (I mean, ""Underland,"" seeing that Wonderland is a ""real"" place in these movies instead of a dream) creatures. I don't care about the family situation of Johnny Depp's most-irritating character, the Hatter. There's no wonder behind Disney's association of evil with physical deformity, as with the big-headed Queen of Hearts this time. Nobody reads the Alice books and thinks the case of the stolen tarts is in need of more drama. Throughout the picture, I was rooting for Alice to fail and that all of Underland would die. Ironically, the movie is too long, as well.These most recent Alice movies aren't only a disgrace to the legacy of Carroll's books, they're a disgrace to the company's founder, Walt Disney. I'm not the biggest fan of his 1951 cartoon version, either, but it's far better than these two, and, at least, Walt had respect for the source. Walt and company made some interesting short films loosely inspired by the books, too, including Mickey Mouse in ""Thru the Mirror"" (1936) and ""Alice's Wonderland"" (1923), which led to Disney's flagship series of Alice comedies, which combined live action with animation long before his namesake conglomerate made abominations from such technical innovations. The only silver lining here is that the box-office success of the 2010 movie turned out to be a fluke--one likely based largely on the novelty of 3D and Depp's fleeting star power--before he Flutterwacken'ed it away--being associated with the Disney brand. With the same dynamics waning after six years, this one bombed. It was about time."

According to the plot, this one should be called ""Crazy Hat Biography"", close to the first story line, the grievances between the red and white queens, indicating that there is no love and hate in this world for no reason, and there is no absolute justice and evil. Everything must have cause and effect. No one can change history, but you can learn something from it and do something impossible. A very good film, not only the characters are very funny, fantasy wonderland inside is also very fantasy. Taking the little story of the White Queen as a child and the Red Queen as a child, it taught us to do something wrong with people who are sorry for important things, as long as the attitude is sincere, apologize and ask for forgiveness from the other party, we can reconcile and cherish the time.

" Ugggh....Burton..just stop now...
",-0.296,0.9241,2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"I have never been the biggest fan of the first film by Tim Burton (as a lover of the books and original animated film) and was not exactly looking forward to what in my opinion was a pointless and unneeded sequel to an equally pointless first film. Hollywood at the moment seems intent in remaking, rebooting, making prequels and sequels of everything it can from old classics (and not so old classics) to foreign films. I'm personally growing tired of it. Whether they think it's needed for a modern younger audience, or there really is a serious lack of writing talent around I'm not sure.Mia Wasikowski returns (after her moderately successful role in Crimson Peak) as Alice and I still feel that she is miscast. Mia to my mind is a very classical actress and suits more period drama type stuff. I think that is where she was cast perfectly in Del Torro's Crimson Peak (Review to come at some point) as that had the style, atmosphere and more importantly the period setting where she shines. Here unfortunately she does not. But then she is not alone in that regard.We find Alice as a ships captain returning home only to find out that her mother is set to sell away everything they have, including her fathers beloved ship in order to stave of financial ruin. Before much longer Alice is following a butterfly and finds herself back in Wonderland where she meets the old gang again (Nice to hear Rickman's voice once again) only to be told the Hatter is dying and that his family may well still be alive. Alice sets out to find them in order to save her old friend.The main problem this film suffers from though is that it is all a little badly paced and a little messy. Bobin to his credit has managed to create a film with a similar look and style to Burton's epic mess (if that indeed actually deserves any credit), but this isn't really any better. The effects and CGI come thick and fast to try and paper the cracks of a muddled story, over-acting and a very weak script. Even the score is mostly recycled, and really Danny Elfman can do so much better when he puts his mind to it. At least production values are good though, but then with the budget this feature had, they sure as hell better be.I personally feel that Depp is long past his best and has not made a good film in close to fifteen years. He lisps his way through his parts and at times looks lost, as if he is wondering exactly what he is doing there. Meanwhile Helena Bonham Carter is just annoying and screeches, screams and over-acts her way through her scenes in an attempt to cover up how bad she is of late. The rest of the cast are acceptable (including Sacha Baron Cohen) but everything is average with no real stand out performances.A visually very impressive film it is sure to please the younger children but while looking impressive, it cannot hide the truly shocking sections of CGI interlaced within the visuals. The trio really do not have the magic anymore, and without Burton, Depp and Carter are average at best now. Such a shame that a once great actor now churns out more turkeys than swans. Stick it on for the kids during the holidays, but don't expect much if you're looking for a quality telling of the book.The Sage's Rating: 5/10"
" Vast improvement
",0.4588,0.9928,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I'm glad to see Tim Burton learned from his mistakes of the first one. While the first one felt like ""Lord of the Rings,"" and had way too much fantasy, this one actually feels like the source material. It's an original story, but still feels like the world of Wonderland. It didn't really feel like a Tim Burton movie. For one, there's color. Also, the visual imagery in this movie looked like something Robert Rodreguiz would make. That's a good thing, though because it's fantastic. The story was intriguing, the villian was comedic while still being somewhat threatening, the action was exciting, it was just an all around fun film. However, there is one thing that bugs me. Making Alice an action heroine. There's nothing wrong with strong female characters in movies, as long as it fits that world, like with Marvel or Star Wars. But when it's in a movie like this, it feels forced. Also, the White Queen apparently can't talk without fluttering her hands. It's very distracting and looks ridiculous. Compared to the first film, this one is actually pretty good. I was genuinely surprised by how much I liked this. It was enthralling! It's what the first movie should have been.

The cast is just as impressive as in the last one. Mia Wasikowska is increasingly good in the role of Alice. Johnny Depp is clearly still having fun as the Mad Hatter which is a pleasure to see. However what I liked most about this was that all the characters get more involved in the action and there is a lovely message about working together and helping out others through the film. There's a wonderful panning shot two thirds through the film of all our heroes marching forward and reaching their goal which was equally funny as well as uplifting. A particular highlight for me was Sacha Baron Cohen as Time; really funny and a brilliant character. James Bobin is certainly a director to watch from his work in Flight of the Conchords and Muppets Most Wanted (one of the funniest films I've seen at the cinema in recent years) and now with Alice Through the Looking Glass; one of the more light-hearted and enjoyable blockbusters of the year"

The issue with these films is that they are not based on story content by Lewis Carroll. They merely take his titles and produce an entirely new story. So basically, why does this new movie exist? MONEY! So the screenwriters made up another new story based in the universe created by Lewis Carroll... How can somebody all these years later extend and tamper with stories that are all time classics. But who knows, maybe by some miracle the extended story lies on par with the imagination and creativity of the legend Lewis Carroll... It doesn't. The story is dumb and boring but it tries incredibly hard to be great. It's the type of story which relies on characters to make dumb decisions in order to extend the runtime. Furthermore the characters are all ridiculously over acted, with the dialogue sounding so forced, in the attempt to match the writing by Lewis Carroll. Also the CGI is trash. It looks like rainbow vomit, but not realistic, more like animation. It also tries to give all the characters these emotional back stories, like the Red Queen and the Mad Hatter. To me I find it's disrespectful. Don't tamper with a classic. The only person who can add to theses characters is Lewis Carroll... So I pretty much hated this movie. It's garbage. Why does it exist? Please remove it from my memory. So therefore I give Alice Through The Looking Glass a generous 3."

This palette of rainbows and geometric magical forest of sites brings Alice-like wonder to the optic nerves. This sequel bursts with vibrant life developing its primary characters further in a strong female led role. This fantasy come to life offers a script filled with a meandering thread of life and death, of space and time, and weaves it magic in tender and sometimes action-filled circles. Predictable for the most part with a not completely developed tie up between sisters, this film is entertaining to the visual senses and a matured bed-time story for the imagination.

" Slightly better than the first one

So, everything I wrote about ""Alice in Wonderland"" stands for this one too. However, this one is perhaps slightly more entertaining.6,5/10From the perspective of the ten-year-old kid, I could maybe raise it to 8/10.Alice in Wonderland (2010)Disappointment
29 August 2018""Alice in Wonderland"" by Lewis Carroll, directed by Tim Burton (whom I love), starring celebrities like Johnny Depp (whom I adore), Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman and legendary Christopher Lee, with technical capabilities of year 2010 and a $ 200 million budget ... You can not blame me for having high expectations. And when you see this wonder of wasted potential you won't blame me for being disappointed either.The film is visually impressive and I really have no complaints, but everything else is lousy. Tim Burton didn't really fail, but we all know that he can do it much much better. Mad Hatter is one of Depp's weakest roles, Mia Wasikowska is sweet and she played Alice quite decent, and only Helena Bonham Carter really made an impression on me. The story is cute but lousy, it's not boring, but it doesn't engage you as much as such adventure should. You will not have the urge to turn off the movie, but you will not be upset if you need to leave it in half. However, I'm not sure how much is that the fault of unimaginative screenwriter and director (it certainly isn't Carroll's fault), and how much is this actually result of this being Disney movie primarily intended for children, which imposes many limitations. But the fact that the film is intended for children is just an explanation, and not an excuse for a naive, shallow and too simple story. A quality movie for children should be multilayered, on the first glance simple enough to entertain children, but with a certain depth that will intrigue adults. This movie doesn't have that. If you are out of elementary school you're too old for this.6/10"
" Very little to do with the book, but a visual treat
",0.5499,0.9576,2018-08-07 00:00:00,4,"As the film begins the viewer might wonder if they are watching a Pirates of the Caribbean knockoff. They are not, instead it is Steampunk Onedin Line out of Poldark, with a hint of Dickens.
The plot is absurd, but no more so than The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (original radio version anyway), and contrives to be coherent within its own definition.
The CGI, other than the intro sequence, is magnificent, like Armageddon, forget the plot, enjoy the spectacle. Alas, the cast of Armageddon threw themselves into their roles with gusto, and offer some of the most glorious over acting imaginable. Here, nobody except the Cheshire Cat and Alice inhabits the role consistently. Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee bear an uncanny resemblance to Boris Johnson, but are no more convincing.
As another reviewer has pointed out, the psychology is absurd, but unlike the physics, is poorly thought out, and falls flat.
There are numerous references to both the Alice Through the Looking Glass and in Wonderland books, but as decoration only, the substance is pure Disney Family Values pap, with visual goings-on to keep the eyes on the screen.
I have seen worse films, much worse, and actually enjoyed this one on balance. Take it as its own valuation and it is fun, but no more than that."

" Better than the Burton one
",0.4404,0.7927,2018-05-30 00:00:00,7,"The two Alice books are must-read classics, and have found their way onto screen in many different versions. James Bobin's film is a direct sequel to Tim Burton's Wonderland film: both take their names from Lewis Carroll's books, but neither takes any more than characters from them: Alice Through The Looking Glass is another original story.The end of Burton's Alice In Wonderland movie saw our heroine ditch her nerdy fiancée and go off to sea. Through the Looking Glass starts with a dramatic sea chase, before Absalom the Butterfly (voiced by Alan Rickman in his final cinema work) calls her back to Underland, where the Mad Hatter (now named as Tarrant Hightopp) is pining away for his lost family. Alice's adventure - seeking the Hightopp family - involves her stealing a time machine from Time himself, a menacing personification of entropy, who is understandably miffed at having this mechanism nicked, especially given that it has the potential to unravel reality.In short, the story has nothing whatsoever to do with Carroll's book. Having said that, it's not a bad story - it holds the attention, has lots of eventfulness and action, illuminates some of the characters, offers a couple of emotional moments, and allows Johnny Depp to mug from under the Hatter's elaborate makeup. I preferred it to the story offered in the previous film.The visuals are, as expected, impressive, and Sacha Baron Cohen's Time is a good addition to the cast. Rhys Ifans as the Hatter's Dad makes less impression. The reservations I had with the first film are still there - Barbara Windsor is just plain Wrong as the voice of the dormouse, naming the characters is both unnecessary and irritating, Anne Hathaway's White Queen's airy-fairy affectations get on your nerves, and Helena Bonfire Carter's Red Queen is still nicked wholesale from Queenie in Blackadder.Mia Wasikowska's Alice is pleasingly feisty, more so than she was in Wonderland. And so we come to Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter. We've seen the character before, of course, and Depp once more gives us the gentle, lisping, well-spoken and slightly barmy Hatter who has a bond with Alice, as well as the occasional psychopath from the Gorbals. To these he adds the declining depressive, a sad reflection of the heartier main iteration. But ultimately they are all Johnny Depp doing funny voices under funny makeups and, despite their appeal, I do find myself wondering if Depp has now overdone the heavily disguised eccentric phase of his career.This is nonetheless an enjoyable film, more so than its predecessor."
" A Hot Mess
",-0.3612,-0.6812,2018-05-22 00:00:00,2,"I really enjoyed the Alice in Wonderland film so I was looking forward to seeing this one. Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is captaining her father's ship, The Wonder, escaping Malay pirates and giving orders to port while her crew is going to starboard but they escape anyway. She's a year late returning to London only to find that her father has died and her jilted fiancé Hamish has taken over. Her mother has agreed to sell the family's shares in the shipping company and give up The Wonder to save her home. Absolem (Alan Rickman) turns up and Alice follows him through the Looking Glass. The Hatter (Johnny Depp) is all depressed. He is haunted by memories of his family killed by the Jabberwocky. Alice has to get the Chronosphere from Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) and return to the past to save Hatter's family. The White Queen (Anne Hathaway) is there making strange gestures with her hands but with well-groomed eyebrows this time and the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) is back and apparently off her meds again. Then Alice wakes up and everything since she went through the looking glass was a dream while she was in the insane asylum. And the Hatter's family is fine, they have been living in an ant farm. The movie goes downhill from there."

My goodness, if they had paid their tech guys a little less, and their story-writers a little more we may have had something good here. (Although in my opinion they were finished by the first movie in this series with the casting of Alice. What a vapid and uninteresting actress.)

I should note that it has nothing to do with the Lewis Carroll novel, instead mixing together a Wellsian time travel plot as Alice once more heads to Wonderland to rescue the Mad Hatter from a certain death. Right from the beginning, where we see Alice captaining her ship in a big CGI set-piece, I knew this film would be complete nonsense and so it proves. It's one of those slick CGI action adventures in which every single shot has to be packed with CGI landscape, imagery, and characters. The same old annoying characters return from the first film to annoy once more (hello, Helena Bonham Carter) while Mia Wasikowska seems to have mastered that single expressioned, mildly bored look. The story goes through cliche after cliche, merely showing off the latest work from the CGI animators rather than having any kind of real character or warmth of its own, and as such it is quite the bore."

" Not enough Wonder
",0.0,0.5271,2018-01-22 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed the first film, I thought it struck a good balance between the whimsical eccentricity of the source material and the modern Hollywood demand for thrill ride action.
But the second time around they get it all wrong, much as they did on the second Pirates of the Caribbean. Too much rushing around and too little humour and quirkiness.
Firstly, right from the get go, they forget to maintain the vital distinction between the Fantasy World of Wonderland, where the impossible is common place, and the Real World, where the possible needs to remain within the constraints of the culture and available technology of the day, in order to be credible.
So we get Alice, the teenage female Captain, sailing her Victorian sail powered merchant ship in ways that defy the laws of Real World physics (Groan)
Who needs to visit Wonderland if we can bend the Real World to our will in this way?
Secondly I think the decision to try and explain the backstory and motivation of the previous film's characters and situations was misguided.
We don't need to know this, and it goes against the whole idea of ""Wonderland"", once things are explained, they often lose much of their ""Magic"", their wonder.
The Queen of Hearts happens to be a bitch and she serves a purpose in the story, that is her only ""why"", we aren't supposed to understand or feel sorry for her.
The fun of Wonderland is in the novelty of the experience and trying to explain it only dilutes or destroys that.
Thirdly they don't introduce enough new characters or situations with the requisite quirkiness, the original is a parade of quirky characters, this one only has a few, with the space between filled up with, briefly, revisiting old ones and, mainly, by pointless rushing about.
I enjoyed Sacha Baron-Cohen's ""Time"", but his assistants were merely derivative of other movies tiny mechanical robots, and there was very little else we hadn't already seen in the first movie.

She ends up back in Wonderland where she must go back in time in order to save Hatter Tarrant Hightopp, who believes his parents are alive, but who died. She meets Time (Sacha Baron Cohen), a kinder German version of Rasputin type of man who must endure a rash of puns.As the film progresses, only Alice can save all of time, space, and dimension and realizes you only have one family.This film lacked the action, scenes, drama, and adrenaline flow of the first one. Through the time travel sequences we obtain background information of the queens and why their relationship as sisters fell apart. It seems the Queen of Hearts didn't eat the tarts after all.Mia Wasikowska continues in her female role model, although not as strong as the first feature.

" Alice Through the Looking Glass lavishes with colorful, eye-dazzling visuals that unfortunately fail compensate for its uninspired story
",-0.7096,0.9928,2017-10-10 00:00:00,5,"Tim Burton's reimagining of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland' in 2010 was far from anything special, but its ability to engage the audiences with its dazzling visual imagery in an effort to distract the director's drift from the familiarity of the source material proved to be enough to make a head-spinning earning at the box office. After sitting through this film's follow-up, which picks up shortly where the end of the film left off, I was only left pondering with the question of why a sequel was even remotely necessary. With Tim Burton reassigned to the producer's chair, James Bobin takes over the director's role in attempt to squeeze the small remaining juice out of the source material, but does with results that are a bit underwhelming to say the least. This film, following the eponymous character on yet another adventure through Wonderland dazzles with just about everything from the visuals to the quirky humor that made granted appeal to its predecessor except a satisfying story. What Bobin's leaves us with is more of a roller coaster ride through a cave of wacky cartoon imagery than a cohesive family fun picture. The film focuses on Alice (played by Mia Wasikowska) who disappears through a mirror and into the magical world of Wonderland where she reunites with the White Queen (played by Anne Hathaway), bobbled head twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum (both played by Matt Lucas), the chesire cat, and white rabbit. They inform her of the urgent news of the Mad Hatter (played by Johnny Depp) growing ill due to his depression of the loss of his family. To save the poor man from his fate, Alice must travel back in time with the help of Time ""himself"" (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) to change the course of events that led to the death of family at the hands of the Red Queen (played by Helena Bonham Carter).For a continuation on Lewis Carroll's classic source material, you would think that writer Linda Woolverton would come up with a premise little more thoughtful than what is sold here. Sadly, that is the only beginning of the misdeed that drives this fairy tale into diminishing effect. The best thing James Bobin's wrings out the picture is an overwhelming barrage of colorful visual design of the whimsical world of Wonderland completed with bloated CGI that pits Aussie actress Mia Wasikowska with the daunting task of interacting with mysterious creatures who only exist in the computer. Wasikowska manages to pull it off and Bobin's makes a fabulous attempt at springing the imaginative world to life. But for everything and everyone else though, that is another story. Wasikowska is left adrift in a story that, while has its moments, never gets truly engaging. The moments of excitement are scarce as the film pedaling swiftly from subplot to another without giving any of the classic supporting character a time to shine. It is especially disappointing for Johnny Depp's Mad Matter who stole the show in the previous film, and is succumbing to a performance that is more vexing than charming. If there is anyone even remotely as charming as Wasikowska here, it is Sacha Baron Cohen, giving a quirky impression of his loopy character. On the other hand, the fun is left to the climax when Alice and the rest of the characters are forced to make a daring attempt to save Wonderland as the entire place from ground is up is morphing into rust. It's too bad however, that lot of the pulse-pounding excitement is left buried under an uninspired plot while the visual effects are left to stand out with open arms. On the bright side, it does make a sweet visual ride with who happen to see this in 3-D.Alice Through the Looking Glass is an underwhelming fantasy ride that benefits from striking visual methodology that manages stick out among the uninspired mess of a story. That is not to say this doesn't make for a wholesome family entertainment, but there are certainly better options to say the least."
" Weird reviewS – A very big surprise, did not expect this
",0.1725,0.996,2017-10-06 00:00:00,7,"First of all, I want to say that I am not a big fan of the first movie, directed by Tim Burton. I thought it was an OK movie and nothing more. When I heard about this sequel, I couldn't care less. And the trailers didn't do much either to get my interest for the movie. So it took ages before I saw this film. And mama mia, was I wrong about it. This is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated movies that came out this year. It's more interesting than the first one, with a far more interesting story and concept. And in the end, it has a really good message for children about time and how we should use time the best way we can, and that the most important thing is our family. The directing is solid, on par with the first movie. The acting is OK, with some good CGI. The music and art direction is actually were the movie shines. There are some incredible beautiful scenes in this movie. It's definitely eye candy for children but adults too. It is a good family movie, and I would never thought that I would say this, but now I feel sad that this movie didn't do better at the box office. And actually really surprising, after all the first movie made over 300 million domestic and over 1 billion worldwide. So what really happened here ? But they could definitely use more time, especially in the beginning, for characters and story. The movie would gain more momentum and be stronger. Most of the CGI is great, but there are some scenes with bad CGI in it. This movie is definitely a step forward, and I would like to see a third movie, but I doubt we will get one. Families will enjoy this and children will learn one or two thing with this movie too. In the end, I would recommend this movie to everyone, go buy it on blu ray. Christmas is coming, and this will definitely be a great gift for every child who didn't see this movie (according to the box office of this movie, there's a lot of children who didn't see this film). This is a good movie, with more pros than cons. + Visually impressive + Art Direction + Very entertaining - They could take more time for character development and story - Some bad CGIGOOD - 7/10"

Sequel to the 2010 movie ""Alice in Wonderland"", this one soon starts with sexist feminist propaganda, with Alice a few years older as, just imagine, captain of a merchant ship. The innocent Alice of the first movie here is an arrogant pirate to her subordinates, she responds crookedly to her mother and steals an artifact that allows her to travel in time even though she has been warned and experienced firsthand that the past is unalterable, and she does it to help the Hatter who is dying of, just imagine, nostalgia for his 'supposedly' dead family. Then in the end all turns out well with impossible understandings: the two queens would never be friends forever and ever even being sisters, for one is notoriously insane, just as Alice's mother's change of heart is totally out of character. Moreover, the story is bad, confusing, and stumbles upon itself like the hands of a clock in infinite circles (and that is what it is about!), the visual aspect being the only redeeming factor.

The basic plot is the Mad Hatter is feeling downtrodden so Alice has to go back in time to help him. While going back in time she must outwit a personification of time. Time was probably the best character in the movie. Lots of CGI time traveling effects. By the way, all 5 points go to the production team as they did a great job. If only there was half the effort put into the story and script. There were a smattering of witty jokes but overall I felt zero engagement or concern for the character's efforts. There was also a sub plot point that bookends the entire movie but by the end you had completely forgotten about it so you are likeoh yah, they had to tie that up rather than add meaning by touching on it throughout."

",-0.6249,0.993,2017-04-21 00:00:00,5,"OK, unlike the previous movie, this time we knew what we were going into, so I had my expectations on low. One thing for sure, Mia's acting improved, she now can make real emotions! who knew? Visually, it is also very good, I really enjoyed the visuals, scenario, costumes, it was really nice-looking and compared to the last movie, packed more vibrant colors. I personally had a very low expectation about Time. When I saw it was Sasha Baron Cohen in a seemingly antagonist role in the trailers, I expected him to just chew the scenery and be annoying, but he was actually one of my favorite characters, maybe because his acting wasn't forced and his role was more than antagonic, more neutral. But speaking of which, he was also the following elephant in the room that was the plot holes in this movie. The plot itself felt like Alice Madness Returns from Spicy Horse. Not enough plot, too much action and visuals, complete with clockwork robots that would feel right at home as a video game boss. But the writing wasn't that bad, some lines were really clever and had a nice ring to the ears. Now, irredeemably, the pop song in the credits was just plain stupid. Seriously Disney? A pop song in a Alice in Wonderland movie? Final thoughts: The movie was definitely clumsy and not enough plot compared to the overbalancing visuals. The acting improved, and just like the previous movie, The plot was simply a weaving string around the poems and footnotes of the original material....not that anybody asked for that. Disney, stick with original material, if you pick a fairy tail, STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL! Now, if you excuse me, I think I'll read again ""The adventures of Alice in Wonderland"" and maybe play Alice Madness Returns."
" Good enough

Some of the special effects were really good, almost magical, representing wonderland beautifully. However, some were almost like a badly made computer game. But my main problem with this movie was the story. The reason why Alice had to go into the time world and steal time was weak, like they had to think of an excuse to make an adventure and that was the first thing that came into mind. The make up was weird (even for wonderland), but the performances were good. Still, however, it wasn't as good as the first movie and surely it won't be a movie that I'll watch again. So, 6 out of 10."
" I really wanted to hate this movie but it is OK at least some of it is
",0.3437,-0.9239,2017-03-28 00:00:00,5,This is the only Alice through the looking glass movie and it is more like an adaptation of the book than an accurate plot that perfectly follows the incidents in it. So naturally I wanted to hate it. Straightaway in the first scene Alice is the captain of a ship and everything in this scene was nonsense. Okay she can be a captain but what did they actually do? Discover a tiny island or race the pirates to it? This has no real tie-in with the story except that Alice loves to be captain of a vessel. It gets a little worse before it gets better. She gets back to England and finds out her father is dead and her mother Helen is signing away the ship to save the house due to some mortgage and or Alice has always lived the way she wanted to and that is not a way for a nineteenth century woman to live. They should live in oppression and must get used to it like Helen has. So Alice must leave the career she apparently was so good at because it is a man's job not a woman's job. At this point I actually hated Helen more than that villainous guy who was behind all this as a revenge for being rejected by Alice when he proposed to her. At least he had a spine and there was a more valid reason for his behavior than woman's etiquette. Alice then follows Absolem voiced by the late Alan Rickman into a looking glass.The madhatter was a moody moping mess and this was worse than the previous movie but it is his family who apparently died and he believes that they are still alive. His sadness is causing him to die and we enter the dramatic Bollywood till the nineties since Bollywood is less cheesy nowadays than Hollywood. Alice not believing in the hatter goes to see Time so she could go back in him LOL and save the hatter's family. Time was done well by the Borat star. Trust me the middle section of the movie was genuinely good and Lewis Carrol funny. The ending was better than the beginning but only by a margin. Where Helen states the ever so obvious 'you are a bad man' at the villain and instead of selling the house gives a shot at feminism.It ends with both mother and daughter getting into a ship for a voyage into the unknown and I wished them Mal Voyage and hoped that they would go down with their ship and so could never attempt a sequel to an already horrible movie. In conclusion it is a movie done so bad that it is kinda good and you would get some entertainment from it unlike its previous.
" Another evidence of a pretty film....a pretty mess, that is.
",0.5994,-0.8942,2017-03-22 00:00:00,2,"It's a shame that the estates of the writers of classic novels can't sue to prevent the assassination of their ancestor's work. Certainly, there have been revisals of classic books, plays and movies that worked, but more often than not, it's an insult to the memory of the creator. Looking like ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" meets ""Downton Abbey"" as this begins, this is a beautiful block of ice that drips and drips until there's nothing but a puddle of colored slop left. Already too old in the first film (where we at least had the creativity of Tim Burton to admire if not the film as a whole), but here, it's under new hands, and the claws have torn apart whatever charm was there before.I am tired of the attempted manipulation of my emotions through special effects, computer animation and overly dramatic music that overpowers ordinary scenes and makes the emotional powerful scenes that needed less underscoring into head scratching tripe. Alice is nasty in her world, telling us she learned nothing, and the charm quickly fades even more when she flies through the mirror and opens that fateful door with the one long step. Her next stop? Nearly two hours of pretentious boredom disguised as art. Ugly in spirit in spite of how colorful it looks, it is completely unfaithful to the story, and for me, that is enough to dismiss it. I have seen several versions of ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" that knew just where to go and where to stop, and this comes to a dead end pretty much near the beginning. The Mad Hatter is not meant to be the protagonist of a story, just a brief stop in Alice's voyage to Wonderland in the first novel. He's not even a part of the second book. Only the rabbit is briefly seen. I've become convinced that Disney is on a secret agenda to manipulate its audiences through mind numbing dumbness and noise, and unlike Alice in the first book, will not know tow to the demands of a bottle to ""drink me"". Just one more piece of evidence that most movie makers have lost the real sense of what art is, not to mention disrespect to the artists of the past. It's started snowing in Hollywood, and the flakes are as large as the blue butterfly that sounds strangely like Professor Snape."

There she finds old friends like the Mad Hatter, White Queen, Tweedledum and Tweedledee and the Cheshire Cat. The Mad Hatter is in a poor state, pining for his family who died several years ago. To correct this, Alice meets Time, and steals his most valuable possession. This brings her into contact, and conflict, yet again with the irascible, insane Red Queen. Not great, but not terrible either. The set up was slow and felt contrived, especially the real life part. Director James Bobin could have made the movie a whole lot better by diving (literally) into Wonderland almost from the get-go. Even the Wonderland side takes a while to find its point and gain momentum.Once it gets going its a fairly decent ride. No great twists or any real point to it all, but is reasonably good fun."

There were a few scenes in the movie that either didn't make sense or which I felt slowed the movie down. but overall it was a pretty good film, cleverly told and the CGI was actually pretty good.

While it certainly takes a great deal of liberty with the original material it is based on, and lacks the energy and drive of the original, it dares to pace itself more slowly and give characters more heart than the original, pun intended. We finally get to see how the Red Queen came to be the decapitation- happy individual she has become, given a decent if slightly heavy- handed fable on the nature of time, and the movie focuses more on the key characters required to tell the story, rather than trying to spread it too thinly over many minor characters. Do I recommend this? Yes. It's not brilliant, but it's worth a watch, if one is in the mood for something a little more slower paced."

Maybe it got better, I kept hoping it'd get better. What little action I saw was totally improbable and defied basic physics. This was before she drops down or goes back or whatever she does. It was done so formulatically that I cannot even tell if the actors did a good job as the characters were cardboard cut outs. Pity I really liked the first movie and enjoy this type of movie in general. I did not read any of the reviews and came in with a very optimistic view. Then wasted 20 minutes of my life.

" Read the book
",0.0,0.992,2017-02-08 00:00:00,1,"The Book ""Through the Looking Glass,"" like it's predecessor, ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland,"" is a charming and witty piece of nineteenth century political satire which is based on a chess game (unlike it's predecessor, which is based upon a card game). But like it's predecessor, it works both as satire (for adults) and fantastic adventure (for children). Both books were written for the Alice Liddle, a young girl at the time and friend of author Lewis Carroll, a childless clergyman and mathematician. The original Disney animated film combined the books much more accurately and never went so far over the top as to lose the essential spirit of the originals. Even the political satire was still present, though dulled by time and overwhelmed by the magic of animation. However, this film and it's predecessor concentrate almost exclusively on eye-popping visuals and fantastic everything, losing sight of the political satire altogether. Plus, the absurd shipboard wrapper to the basic story is totally unnecessary and misleading. Apparently, two screenplays were mashed together in an awkward and contrived effort to reinvent the story for today's audiences. Why? Obviously, to showcase the (admittedly) extraordinary computer graphics and special effects skills Hollywood currently has at its disposal. And give the actors another chance to dress funny, wear weird makeup, and act crazy. The original story is fantastic, agreed, but it is a lot more than that. Both of these new interpretations stop at the fantastic and miss all the rest. Turn the sound off and ignore the naval wrapper, try to forget the original books, and this film can be enjoyed as a visual feast. It might help to get high first. Otherwise, you may wonder if anyone was actually in charge. Maybe everyone was in charge!You more serious viewers, try watching Disney's animated ""Alice In Wonderland"" from 1951 and Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth.""In the world of traditional art, one basic rule of thumb is ""Less Is More."" Here, we get, as with so many of today's special effects driven films, ""More Is Less."""

I also am only aware of the one Alice story we all know more or less and which got depicted in the first movie of course.For a sequel this was pretty good and the story was easy to follow. The effects are good too (generally speaking, not 3D). Of course since this is a fairy tale you kind of know where this is heading (no pun intended).

All I can hope for is that the dismal returns on Disney's investment guarantees that the studio won't desecrate another classic. Wishful thinking I'm sure - they didn't learn anything from John Carter.

Burton's movie is a jumbled sequel to Lewis Carroll's work whereas this one reinterprets it completely. The first one is no masterpiece of storytelling but at least, it has the fun of new invention of imagery. This one is no longer so new. Wasikowska's spunky innocence has turned into full fledged defiance against old-timey sexism. I actually like the attempt to find the origins of the sisters' rivalry but I don't like the execution. Sacha Baron Cohen's Time would probably work better as a supporting character. He's neither villain nor hero. Alice is more reckless than heroic.

The only thing that really made me happy was listening to Alan Rickman's voice, one more time.STORY - Alice has been gone from the Underland as well as from the real land for a long, long time.

Hatter is distraught and is dying out of grief and Alice must help him. In order to help him, Alice goes to Time himself in order to fix the past and thus mend the present. This could have been an interesting story but the screenplay starts to fall apart after 45 minutes of screen-time. There is no real character motivation and everything seems to fall in the correct place with no real explanation. Like how did Iracebeth meet Time? How did she even return because as far as I remember, she was sent to exile. It was so convenient when Alice falls into the wrong timeline and finds out about the exact things she has to fix. I know it's a kid's story but there was no fun in it. Everyone was so weepy and emotional and that brings me to the director.DIRECTION - So, this one is not directed by Tim Burton. It is directed by James Bobin who has directed the Muppet movies and Ali G. Now that explains a lot. I just don't understand that why doesn't a director return for the sequel? I mean, you started it. Just see it through! James Bobin just sucked out the fun. I know the original was cheesy and over-the-top but it was fun. A bit exposition heavy but it added to the character of the Underland. This movie just expected us to assume where something is taking place. Last night I was watching a video about the flaws in BvS and there the Youtuber mentioned that BvS didn't have a sense of place. Gotham and Metropolis look the same. The characters are kept in close-up so you don't feel the place they are in and that detaches the audience from feeling anything real. The case here is almost similar. The 1st movie always introduced the place where the characters were entering, due to which I'd know that where the characters are. Here it was just jump, jump and jump. I don't want to include a separate section for CGI and editing so I am including it here. The editing wasn't snappy enough. If you'd remember the tea- party scene in the 1st movie, you'd notice that it was very quick and that made that scene more humorous. Here, they missed a lot of beats and it wasn't only limited to the tea-party scene but the whole movie. The CGI felt extremely off at times. The lighting was wrong in the opening scene as well as when Alice meets Hatter for the 2nd time.ACTING - The acting was very bland. They were doing the same thing that they did in the original. Johnny Depp felt a bit off but I won't blame him. The worst of the lot was Sacha Baron Cohen, who was actually doing a Borat impression the whole time. Again, won't blame him.FINAL VERDICT - I hate it when sequels just bank on the success of the 1st one and doesn't improve on it. What is the rush? Make a proper script, take your time and give us a good movie. If you've haven't seen this one, don't. Just re-watch the original. This one is certainly not worth your TIME."
" A watchable adventure
",0.3182,0.9541,2017-01-04 00:00:00,5,"First let me state that Alice through the Looking Glass is NOT a bad movie but there's a few reasons why I only gave it a 5/10.The plot of the movie revolves around the time honoured classic of time travel and making sure that the future isn't altered through travelling back into the past... its been done a thousand times, however I have no problem with that as it makes for enjoyable viewing.The time travel aspect of the movie was done well and its interesting to see some of your favourite characters from the first movie in the past as well as learning a few things about The Mad Hatter and The Red Queen that were not told in the first film.Mia and Helena are the stars of this movie for me , I know everybody loves Depp and his portrayal of the Mad Hatter but I much prefer some of the other characters in this movie.Although I liked the film I just felt like it was lacking something. It seemed as though the studio spent too much time on making the film visually stunning and kind of missed the important part which was the storytelling.All in all it lost its muchness."
" Alice Brings Power
",0.0,0.9136,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Once again Alice brings power to women's, telling that we need to stand up for ourselves, our goals, and shows that we only need courage to go further, persistency and faith to conquer the impossible. Although the movie is a pure fantasy reality based on an astonishing book, this is a great metaphor to overcome the obstacles and negativity that try to bring us down everyday. In the other hand, teach us that we should always help a true friend in pain, like the Hatter. In this second work, the viewer have the opportunity to explore more of the Wonderland and it's characters, specifically, the life story of the Red Queen, the way Time acts and the struggles of the Mad Hatter. If you want to emerge in this magical world beyond a mirror's glass and above the waves of time, watch this piece and let your mind go to unknown places."
