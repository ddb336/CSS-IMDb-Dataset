" A Good, Solid Movie
",0.5423,0.9341,2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,"I'm not sure what I was expecting to see when my sister suggested this movie to me. She knows I'm a fan of Russell Crowe, so I tend to like most of his movies. I'll put this movie in that column too.The movie takes a different approach in dealing with loss.Good strong performances by Crowe, and surprisingly, by Seyfried, whom I tend NOT to like. But she turned in a strong performance in this movie.Watch it. You'll be glad you did."

This movie helps you see the unexpected reasons behind some choices that society usually explains in a stereotypical and superficial manner. It's really amazing and worth watching."

It will leave you reeling with anger, as it completely destroys this whole amazing movie.It shouldn't have happened. If this had gone the RIGHT way it would've been a perfect 10.What a shame."

" I would rather have stayed bored than take a chance on this one.
",-0.0258,-0.965,2020-07-12 00:00:00,1,"This movie has problemsThey keep talking about Russell Crowes character having mental problems when they only show he has some sort of seizure disorder related to the car accident. And it's not just the legal spin of a contested custody battle.Amand Seyfried's character howerve DOES have mental problems which makes her life as a social worker all the more ludicrous. Crazy, immature and unlikeable. Run Aaron Paul, don't walk... but of course, in this pathetic melodrama, he doesn't.I'm honestly sick of seeing Bruce Greenwood in small, underdeveloped roles like this. I just watched the directors cut of Doctor Sleep (it's not worth it to see, btw) in the hopes his role had more material (yes, I read the book and know it wasn't a big part-then why cast him in it?).I want my 1hr and 56m back even though I saw it for free.It replaced my boredom with a dull empty feeling. I would rather be bored."
" Fathers & Daughters Never Say Goodbye!
",0.0,0.9893,2020-07-05 00:00:00,8,"Amazing movie about the strong relationship between a father, who suffered so much but wanted to hold his daughter near, and her loving daughters. Crowe is one of my favorite actors and he did a fabulous acting. As father he did all he could. Won Pulitzer prices while being sick to ensure his daughter has the best in life.
Amanda did a great work as well as a daughter who lost her mother so early and didn't get all the love she deserved in her life. Movie is not just about just these characters but I felt it could be related to all those kids and parents who struggle in life and do not get chance to grow together. I can only say my eyes were wet in the end...."

" Love is not love?
",0.21,0.5859,2020-07-01 00:00:00,5,"The film emphasizes over and over how much the father loved the daughter and vice versa. And yet, when she is an adult she says she is incapable of love. That is absolutely absurd and makes the whole story a farce."

I'd certainly increase the score if they had cut off 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes of it... It's not that I don't like lenghty movies, it's just that the story could be more direct. Half movie in, you know all the remainder of it... Maybe it is for the younger audiences who have never read anything about parents/children relationships.

" Bad, in an annoying way
",-0.7351,-0.9721,2018-08-27 00:00:00,4,"Given the theme and the cast, this could have been a poignant film, but it was not. The storyline didn't make sense, and the lack of logic and loopholes were difficult to ignore while watching. The dialogues were similarly lame and unconvincing; in some cases overly dramatic. There were too many dialogues which tried to come across as deep, but didn't gel with the scene and with the otherwise shallow plot. However, the real downside is that the movie is incredibly annoying, because you'll need to put up with the weak story and dialogues and continue watching right up till the end if you want to find out what happens to the father & his daughter."
" Maybe you gotta be a girl's father...
",0.0,0.9817,2018-08-27 00:00:00,9,"... to understand this movie and be so touched by it as I was. I can't quite grasp why the critics gave it such a run-down! You could improve it here and there - as in anything in life - but the superb acting, especially Russell Crowe's, and the great plot, makes it very easy to understand what it feels like to be a daughter's loving father after undergoing a major disaster and being on the verge of going through another one - both diametrically distinct but very much moving. Call this movie melodramatic if you may, but I definitely recommend it. More so if you're a girl's dad."
" Disappointing!
",-0.5411,0.8849,2018-05-27 00:00:00,2,"With Russel Crow I expected more. I agree that the plot is shallow and repetitive. Amanda Seyfried is a terrible actress. As grown-up Katie, she has one-night stands, one after the other, but when she meets a certain guy, she acts like the Virgin Mary with him. Why didn't she jump his bones like she did all the others? Implausible. But after the two are ""in love,"" he comes home to find a messed-up bed with a used packet of rubbers on the floor beside it. He storms out. At the end he forgives her...implausible regarding what went between the ""storming out"" and forgiveness at the end.And although ""Katie"" is a psychologist, she doesn't adhere to her own training. And nothing is ever even alluded to about the ""reason"" (childhood trauma?) that resulted in her self-destructive behavior.A total waste of time."

" Seizures and Tears
",-0.2263,0.8962,2018-01-19 00:00:00,4,"Okay I got it. Director Muccino must have found a profitable vein and he's exploiting it in a rather shameless fashion. The script, very much like in ""Summertime"" ""The Pursuit Of Happiness"" and ""Seven Pounds"" is an expositional tear jerker with characters who explain themselves with every line of dialogue. 
Russell Crowe has his first seizure within the first few minutes of the film and then he has others, I don't know how many but it felt like 400. So at the end we have a 2 hour movie out of a tiny idea swollen by an infinite series of cliches that includes, I'm not kidding, a musical, romantic montage when the young lovers first meet. The extraordinary Janet McTeer has one scene and the extraordinary Jane Fonda, one or two. So this must have been an expensive production and in fact Fathers and Daughters has everything , cast, looks, settings, everything except real thought and original ideas."
" Totally sucked
",-0.5095,-0.7264,2017-12-29 00:00:00,1,Totally sucked throwing it in the trash regret buying it
" Superbly well done tear-jerker with an excellent cast! Totally and 8 Star Flick!
",0.7494,0.9029,2017-11-16 00:00:00,8,"At first, I thought this was based on a Pulitzer Prize-Winning book. I was fooled. The book referred to in this movie is fictional only, but I would have given the writer of this book something highly unforgotten because this movie is prize-worthy alone. Never mind the potential as a book here. You wonder why a lot of movies don't come from books and novels rather than just screen- writers, but I really do hope Brad Desch got something for writing and producing this script. The acting was prize-worthy as well. Did this movie win anything? It should have. I would watch this over and over again! It is a gripping and emotionally-inspired work of art! Every part of this movie seems like it could have been based on a real story. We all need proper parental guidance and unfortunately some parents didn't get the proper guidance they need when they were in need of their parents. To all parents, including fathers and father figures....the youth need you to properly guide them NOW! Our future well-being is non-existent without your proper parental or guardian guidance. Top-notch drama film, well-deserved 8 Stars!"
" Incredible acting
",0.0,0.9829,2017-09-29 00:00:00,9,"After his wife's death, Russell Crowe can't cope with being a single father. He may be a beloved successful writer, but he has deep psychological problems. Twenty-five years later, his daughter Amanda Seyfried is getting her masters in psychology and volunteering at a children's center. The film cuts back and forth between the past and the present, and while normally I don't like those types of movies, Fathers & Daughters is an exception.For some unknown reason, this film was completely ignored during awards season, even though the acting is phenomenal and Brad Desch's script is powerful. Russell Crowe gives the type of performance that is deserving of an Oscar, but he didn't even get a nomination. He hasn't shown off his acting chops like this in over ten years. Kylie Rogers plays his little girl, and her performance in the film is incredible and heart-wrenching. I hope she has a marvelous career as she grows up; child actresses with that much talent are hard to find. I thought Amanda Seyfried would cheapen the film with her lack of talent, but surprisingly, she wasn't bad. Her character is written to have tons of problems, so her unlikability isn't really her fault. While I may be critical of actors sometimes, I'm the first to admit when someone shows their hidden talents, and Amanda has a couple of very well-acted scenes in the film.This is a very heavy movie, so get out your Kleenexes and have the pause button ready; you'll need to take a couple of breaks and have a good cry. I watched it with my mom, but anyone brave enough to watch it with her dad will probably shed twice as many tears. Rent it, though, even if you need to watch it by yourself. It's worth it."
" Father figure

This leads him to live separately with his beloved little daughter, Katy, for 7 months. After getting older, traumatized Katy is in a trouble with loving people. Then, she meets up a man who admires Jake's novel, Cameron¬Ö This film is confusing at first because the story goes on back and force. Yet, this is like a riddle and a key to ambiguous scenes by degrees. At the same time, the film is beyond words and it is literally hard to hold back tears. In particular, Jake's struggling of both taking care of Katy and writing a novel simultaneously is described. This makes me think better of what my father has done to me in a daily life positively. I was wondering why the title ""Fathers and Daughters"" is plural. If this story is just related to Jake and Katy, this should be singular title ""Father and Daughter"". In my opinion, this story conveys a message to us to value family bond more and more in general. In addition, seemingly the film is about father and daughter story, but Katy's love story is included. Keep an eye on the film!"
" Not worth to watch
",-0.1695,0.6943,2017-06-11 00:00:00,1,I cannot see any logical reason between a girl (daughter) who sleeps with men randomly to suppress her feelings of sorrow and the love of parents and their kids. Sexual concept dominates the main plot... The strong love between a dad and a daughter has been ruined. So I have had hard time to finish the movie.. It is boring..

" Incredible Acting & Emotion Covers Up Almost All Faults
",-0.4256,0.9947,2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Based strictly on content, ""Fathers & Daughters"" is not the type of movie I would usually see. However, after watching the trailer and seeing the star power of Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, and Aaron Paul, I decided to give it a try. While the plot of this film can be a bit shaky at times, one almost doesn't realize it because the quality of the acting invokes such strong emotions all the way through.For a basic plot summary, ""Fathers & Daughters"" opens with writer Jake Davis (Crowe) struggling to cope with his life after the loss of his wife in a car accident. Fortunately, he still has his lovely daughter Katie (Kylie Rogers), but even that is threatened when his seizures and medical problems begin. Flash-forward 20-some years later, and Katie (Seyfried) has grown up to become a successful social worker...who is also as promiscuous as they come in terms of love life. However, when a new little girl named Lucy (Quvenzhane Wallis) is put in her care, and then Katie meets Cameron (Paul), she begins to be confronted by the demons in her life that have caused her so much pain.I wish I could say that ""Fathers & Daughters"" is a ""best of all-time"" type of movie, but the fact is that it isn't. The writers/producers/director make some head-scratching choices about how they play the narrative out, and there are a few key plot points missing that probably needed to be included to make this a ""tighter"" film. So, this is really more of a ""niche"" film built on emotion.But boy oh boy, though, does that niche ever get filled perfectly here! I'm not usually one to get overly emotional during a film-watching experience (at least visually), but ""Fathers & Daughters"" moved me to tears on a few occasions. It truly is that powerful of a film, as it deals primarily with the relationship between a father and daughter (something that isn't always seen in these types of films). It would have been very, very easy for this film to turn into a typical tearjerker, as all the elements for it are indeed present. Fortunately, although not without a few hiccups along the way, it ends up producing natural instead of contrived emotions, which I have a great deal of respect for. All the emotional moments in the movie feel earned.In large part, I believe that is due to the incredible acting performances in the flick. It has been awhile since I've seen a movie where every performance was this spot-on. Crowe really commits (and when that happens, he's always golden), Seyfried is (as usual) perfect for her role, and Paul is absolutely killing every role he takes these days. Even the youngsters, Wallis and especially Rogers, bring the emotion perfectly.So, while ""Fathers & Daughters"" may not rise to elite heights due to a few storytelling difficulties, it has more than enough acting and emotion to be a solid film. It uncommonly moved me during my viewing of it, and I will always remember the experience because of it. Even if this doesn't look like your ""cup of tea"", you may want to give it a chance, as more than likely you'll be moved as well."
" Connection (lost)
",0.0,0.9398,2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"There is a special bond between fathers and daughters. So far so good, but what if that's all that is left for both? Can they be apart? And what does happen, when they have to (for medical reasons)? Also where does that lead our main character down the stretch? There are a lot of questions that are open, though I do believe that one of them will be easy to answer for most when looking at the character Amanda S. portrays and how she acts and reacts to certain situations.There is no nudity, but the MPAA deemed the not graphic depicted intercourse scenes (a couple and shouldn't be a reason to watch this) to be enough for an ""R"" rating. While the viewer will connect the dots and understand why those scenes are necessary (especially because we don't linger upon them), the movie tries to keep it mysterious all the way through. I don't think that part works that good, but the movie is more than decent enough especially because of the performances"
