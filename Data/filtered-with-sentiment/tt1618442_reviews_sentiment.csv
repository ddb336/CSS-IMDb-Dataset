" The Last Witch Hunter
",-0.3612,0.802,2021-03-28 00:00:00,8,It was a good movie. Casting was good and it has some great ideas.the only problem I saw was his sword.it was too short.
" it's okay
",0.2263,0.9855,2021-03-24 00:00:00,6,"I was hugely disappointed to find out this movie is set in modern New York. The introductionary scene dates back to medieval times and was a perfect start. It should have stayed in the Dark Age. But okay I decided to continue watching and was scarcely rewarded. The story isn't gonna knock you off your seat, but it fits the whole production. It's supposed to be an action drama with spells and witches. And that is executed quite entertaining. The visuals are exceptionally great. The set inside the tree was actually built and lit on fire. The soundtrack by Steve Jablonsky is bold and serves each scene very well. I still don't buy Vin Diesel's smooth voice and the cute look he puts on in the safe house. Anyway if you just want to enjoy a fantasy flick then crank up the volume of your hifi and go on annoying your neighbours!"
" Nope. No way.
",0.2235,-0.492,2021-03-13 00:00:00,2,90 Million Dollars! absolutely wasted making this dreck. I watched it so you won't have to. Avoid!
" It's a pretty good movie to watch on rainy days and it knows it
",0.7003,0.945,2021-03-01 00:00:00,7,"While the movie isn't cinema worthy it is an Excellent quality movie for Netflix.It's got a happish ending and isn't too plot heavy or filled with jump scares.It's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously (not that it's a total comedy but it doesn't try too hard to make you get excited into the plot which is nice as yiu don't have to think too hardDecent world building and it doesn't try to set up sequels too much tho there is a a little attempt to.It's acted well since the actors aren't overacting too much.
Negatives:A little silly how one of the main characters who appears to be quite young owns a huge apartment and a business (I'll leave it at that)Some things are left a little unclear too but it's forgivable given that you won't be dying to know them"
" The Last Witch Hunter
",-0.3612,0.1154,2021-02-28 00:00:00,4,"Flat, uninspired and derivative. Once the narration starts you begin to think what possessed Michael Caine to phone in his performance.A big fat cheque I presume will be his answer.Vin Diesel is out of gas as the 800 year old immortal witch hunter Kaulder. Made immortal by a curse from the witch queen.In the modern day, there is peace between the witches and the church. Co-existence that is about to be shattered.The priest Dolan 36th (Michael Caine) who is Kaulder's assistant and liaison with the church has retired. To be replaced by Dolan 37th (Elijah Wood) who once met Kaulder.Now someone is attacking Kaulder, someone with power and a grudge.There is little magic here just a bigger budget and more noise. The story is plodding, a major twist does not come as a surprise.At least there are some nice action scenes, a bit of humour but so many underwritten characters."
" Ugh....
",0.0,0.0,2021-02-12 00:00:00,2,How does this schlock get greenlighted!? Don't they have focus groups approve these dreadful nightmares first?! Not to mention that this director actually did a good movie in the past with Sahara. But this is loaded with pure dribble.
" Like To See a Sequel
",0.3612,0.9848,2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed The Last Witch Hunter. I actually think its one of Vin Diesels best movies.
A nice atmosphere, excellent effects and a really good story.I thought the acting was great, particularly the support cast.Its exciting, interesting and funny...it ticks all the boxes :)"
" The Witcher.
",0.0,-0.5341,2021-01-06 00:00:00,4,"After watching the incredible Perfect Blue (1997-also reviewed) for my 2,500th review on this site,I decided to relax with a easy-going flick. One of the first flicks to pop up when I checked the Sci-Fi/ Fantasy section on Netflix,I got set to join at the witching hour.View on the film:Directing for the first time since 2010's The Crazies remake, director Breck Eisner & Dead Calm (1989-also reviewed) cinematographer Dean Semler lift the sword for a pulpy Fantasy tale, and completely miss the mark, with a horribly muddy aesthetic, and over reliance on CGI dimming the sparks of playfulness this Fairy Tale Action flick should have been beaming with.Conjured from lead Vin Diesel being a Dungeons and Dragons fan,and having Olafur Darri Olafsson, Elijah Wood and Sir Michael Caine join in to take a roll of the 20-sided dice, the screenplay by Cory Goodman,Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless promisingly open their tale with Kaulder being cursed with eternal life and working for a secret organisation to keep the truce between witches and humans strong.Sadly,the writers turn but the pulpy offerings sour, with long, messy dips into a endless memory spell (flashbacks) and plodding non-twists revealing those standing against the last witch hunter."
" Good popcorn-flick, 7.5 for me
",0.4404,0.9669,2021-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Witches, alchemy, interesting story, great CGI, Vin Diesel and good acting. Can't really ask for more, at least for pure entertainment.Of course this could have been an amazing and highly original movie - with a slightly different cast, (a different title), a deep dive into the witches' world and lore and more nuances to the plot.But for what it is, I really liked it and can only recommend watching it."
" Very enjoyable
",0.4927,0.9514,2020-12-14 00:00:00,8,"Hard to take vin diesel seriously these days with that dreadful xxx return of cage and the goody fast and furious franchise but the last witch hunter shows the man can hold his own. This is a good entertaining movie, it's simple to follow, casted well, good plot and plenty of action. I hope to see bin diesel star in more movies like this as they suit his style.
Worth watching, make your own mind up."
" two deserved stars
",0.0,0.2592,2020-10-27 00:00:00,2,"I gave it two stars because someone took the time out to hold a camera on this one and someone else spent a considerable amount of time on the CG.Neither of them wanted to be part of the film, but they had to, to put food on their tables. I really hope this is the last of the witch hunters."
" OK family viewing
",0.4466,-0.1804,2020-10-24 00:00:00,4,"OK family viewing, didn't really do it for me. Felt like Constantine clich√©s meets Hansel And Gretel but nowhere near as good. Still big budget production with good special effects, if there is nothing better to watch worth a view."
" ""Try doing that with an iPad""
",0.0,0.8982,2020-10-23 00:00:00,6,"Following the defeat of their wicked queen many, many years ago, an uneasy truce exists between witches and man - the former being permitted to co-exist so long as they don't use their magic. Vin Diesel is ""Kaulder"" the last of a breed of witch hunters; their job being to enforce this truce and to bring to justice any transgressors. Aided by a ""Dolan"" - a human priest - he has managed to survive for over 800 years until his 36th one - Sir Michael Caine - is attacked and cursed. Now he must try to break this curse and free his friend before it kills him. As his investigations deepen, he discovers that the race is now on to stop the evil witch queen for resurrecting and wreaking havoc on all humanity! It's quite a fun fantasy adventure held together fairly well by Diesel and Rose Leslie (""Chloe"") with the odd intervention from a curiously cast Elijah Wood as the 37th ""Dolan"" and, of course, Caine. The story is pretty formulaic, and there is practically no doubt about the outcome - but the effects are quite decent, as is the imagination of writer Cory Goodman in weaving some less obvious threads into the story. There are far more sophisticated, better crafted, fantasy adventures out there, but this one is perfectly watchable nonetheless."
" Seen a lot worse
",-0.4767,0.9656,2020-10-10 00:00:00,6,"Vin Diesel stars as an Immortal Witch Hunter in this okay but not great action flick. The premise has been used loads of times, but the plot is okay, the acting, above average, and the effects are pretty good. Rose Leslie and Michael Caine are good in the supporting roles, but Frodo seems out of place.They keep on trying to find new movie franchises for Vin Diesel and this one didn't make the grade, although I admit I would have watched a sequel. Not bad."
" Not what I expected...
",0.0,0.9051,2020-08-26 00:00:00,6,"If you watch the trailers you would be forgiven if you thought this would be set in medieval times, somewhat like a Van Helsing style romp...but...it's not.It alternates between medieval times and present day, and does those transitions well, mostly as flashbacks so most is set in modern times.Vin Diesel is serviceable in a role that is not all out action, Michael Cain plays a cameo and Rose Leslie also is really just a support role but plays it well enough.I found the action scenes from medieval times not very well done, they were fast action and short clips that didn't quite work, I also found the Queen's (Julie Engelbrecht) costume/makeup very unconvincing.Worth the watch but don't expect too much"
" Vindiesel action movie
",0.0,0.3244,2020-08-15 00:00:00,6,"I find most of his movies very similar and am fine with that. So this isn't some amazing fantasy movie, it's a vin diesel action, some minor nonsensical fantasy and interesting enough. If you like vin diesel it's worth watching. If you find his movies dumb and over the top, then just skip this."
" Only movie Vin Diesel smiles in !
",0.5255,0.4128,2020-08-08 00:00:00,4,"It started off really well . It was dark, mysterious , and intriguing . Michael Caine was terrific in it . Vin Diesel as usual was his exciting and active self , fighting off the 'badies' . Then in stepped Rosie Leslie as Chloe . It became a little bit weak . Her acting was atrocious. She was insipid . She couldn't pull off the character she was meant to play . There was also no chemistry or 'connection ' between her and Vin Diesel. The movie started to go downhill too. It became one big jumbled mess! It went from one scene to another and then another. It was as though the director was tripping ! Elijah Woods character was very predictable too. It's. Shame it was such a let down as the cast was fairly strong ( apart from Rosie Leslie) ."
" So-so
",0.0,0.8294,2020-08-03 00:00:00,5,Had some good moments And of course Vin but in the end of the day it is a mixture of several movie themes and agree to several other reviews: definitely predictable.
" I really wanted to like this...
",0.4144,0.945,2020-07-21 00:00:00,4,"I have to be honest. I was pulling for this film. It has Vin Diesel as the main character. It is urban fantasy. It has Catholic symbolism. Its CGI is surprisingly good. It has Vikings in it. What's not to love?And to be fair, the first half of this film is pretty much what I was hoping for. Vin Diesel plays Kaulder, a man cursed with immortality who has spent the centuries of his life hunting witches and sorcerers who would misuse the gift of magic. But now his original woe, The Witch Queen who cursed him to live forever, is returning. So he has to team up with his latest cleric helper as well as a young witch bearing an ancient magical gift in order to beat this adversary.We get a lot of really cool magical spells being cast. We get a lot of religious symbolism. We get one mean warlock named Baltasar Ketola (√ìlafur Darri √ìlafsson) hunting Kaulder - easily the best character in the film aside from Kaulder himself.But then comes the second half. Baltasar is quickly tossed aside when Julie Engelbrecht's Witch Queen becomes more prominent and she just isn't as interesting as Baltasar. Part of that is the heavy CGI makeup but part of that is sheer charisma missing from her performance.Beyond that there's also the problem of predictability. We joked around when the first few introductory scenes were playing out, predicting what would happen to certain characters if this was a bad B-list horror fantasy film. Then we forgot those jokes when the first half of the film managed to pull us in.Every single one of those jokes came true...The Last Witch Hunter has a good premise. It has bones. I can see why Vin Diesel is interested in making a sequel. But man, was the second half of this film rough. Disappointing doesn't even begin to describe it."
" Starring Vin Diesel as Vin Diesel
",0.0,0.9341,2020-07-06 00:00:00,4,"And that's what you need to know, Vin Diesel, a bunch of CGI special effects. Okay action set pieces and a good supporting cast including Michael Caine and Elijah Wood.Vin plays a medival warrior who is out to kill the witch queen who killed his family, but in turn is made immortal by the queen as a curse. He becomes the center of a religious order focused on keeping the peace between witches and normal humans. Hardly an original premise... Hellboy, Men in Black, etc. come to mind.Well, give Vin his props, he's a likeable actor. But nothing about this movie is memorable....Some parts were downright predictable. Was anyone surprised when Frodo Baggins turned out to be the traitor? I wasn't. I'll probably forget I saw it in a month."
" Good watch...
",0.4404,0.923,2020-07-05 00:00:00,7,"I like action and the character that Vin Diesel builds around him in any role he plays, same happened here. Overall movie was nice and had interesting twists and I wish it had more meaningful plot and characters."
" An action and adventure film which is not surprising, despite being able to entertain.
",0.4188,0.6768,2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,"I approached this film with caution and low expectations. However, I ended up concluding that it's not as bad as I thought it could be. In fact, despite being far from brilliant, its a very decent action and adventure film that will entertain us quite well, if we dont give excessive relevance to the problems that arise.Everything is centred on a man who cannot die, the result of a curse he was the victim of in the Middle Ages, when he set fire to the sacred tree of the queen of witches and tried to kill her. He has lived an unusually long human life in the service of the Catholic Church, and has been busy chasing witches and magicians who violate magical laws (does it sound enough like Harry Potter?).The film stars Vin Diesel, a muscular veteran of action films, who already knows what he has to do and does it without any problems. He is not even close to my favorite actor and sometimes he has the dramatic expressiveness of an apple (I am being nice), but he is not one of the worst around. In this film, he even does a satisfying job. Next to him is an impeccable Michael Caine, making extensive use of traditional British impassivity, a good Rose Leslie, an imposing Olafur Darri Olafsson and even Julie Engelbrecht, who does what she really has to do. We can still see Elijah Wood, who looks surprisingly well in a cassock but does not seem to know how he ended up in this film, disappearing quickly. Did he make a mistake in the studio?As expected, the film has a lot of regular CGI but does not bring anything truly spectacular. The action scenes are also good but relatively mild. Of course, everything seems false, of course the film does not have a hint of credibility, but if the audience only wants to entertain their spare time, I think that is enough. The sets, costumes, cinematography and soundtrack are also not particularly worth mentioning."
" AN UNDERRATED BUT FANTASTIC FANTASY THRILLER
",0.7579,0.9474,2020-04-24 00:00:00,8,"I had to admit after watching this extremely underrated but excellent film that it's become my favourite Vin Diesel movie. I always liked the beefed-up & tough Vin Diesel from way back watching the Cult Classic Sci-fi Horror, Pitch Black at the cinema & from then i liked him in the Ensemble Gangster Drama, Knockaround Guys & he was good in the first XXX flick & excellent in the old school style Revenge Cop Thriller, A Man Apart & the Awesome Chronicles of Riddick but i never liked the silly Fast & Furious franchise & his Apocalyptic sci-fi Thriller, Babylon A.D was pretty good & Riddick was Awesome too & of course this fantasy Horror Thriller, The Last Witch Hunter i loved.I don't know why the boring critics hated this? Yet they will like the latest crap ""Tom Cult Cruise"" film (I hate that guy) so it comes down to what you like yourself & i never follow anyone as i like what i like & that's it.Here the action legend Vin Diesel is really good as an immortal professional Witch Hunter that works for the Church & hunts down ,only the Evil witches & there's just as many good ones living among us. This film is set in present day New York City & it's captured beautifully with the cinematography, especially the night time scenes & the look of the witches hideouts that look like parts of a beautiful enchanting Forrest, are stunning, the look, sets & production design is outstanding in this movie, it's a visual treat. Diesel plays Kaulder & he's lived for so long & has seen all the atrocities of the world throughout his years as he was cursed by an Evil Witch centuries ago & has lost his wife & daughter to the evil ones. Diesel gives a solid & serious action hero performance as the tough immortal warrior that all witches fear abit like the Blade character in a way & he's good as our hero to follow on his witch hunt in this fantasy world full of black Magic.
The supporting cast is good too with the ageing legend Michael Caine & Elijah Wood & a really good performance from Rose Leslie as a good witch named Chloe, who helps our hero in his battle against evil.
As i said the production design for this film is spectacular & obviously had a huge budget splashed over this & it's got a slick look & a decent music score too. The main Evil Queen Witch is a scary design & is actually frightening & makes for a very dangerous villain for Diesel to battle.
The beginning sequence is incredible, exciting & creepy as Diesel with a gang of Viking warriors enter a huge ancient Tree type Witch nest that is a hidden coven for demonic witches that are scary as hell & reminded me of the possessed demons in the Evil Dead remake.
Good atmosphere & mix of Horror & fantasy.This is a fun big budget blockbuster popcorn movie & it's a good time but it's also a well made & richly detailed fantasy action Thriller.
I really enjoyed it & it's an underrated Gem & one i will watch again & again"

I despise medieval age themed movies. I really did not want to watch it.

So I watched it. And I was so surprised. It is a great movie.
Interesting, fast-paced, nice plot, nice acting.

I think that Elijah Woods could have given a much better performance. But Vin Diesel was great.

",0.4574,-0.9904,2019-10-25 00:00:00,8,"And it worked... (Did you see that, I reversed the ellipses and the exclamation mark. Bite me.)The main character: a cursed witch hunter, his family killed by witches. He wanted to die with the witch queen, but got cursed to walk the earth as an immortal. He decides to forge a treatise with the witches, burying the hatchet. Witches that break the law get reprimanded or locked away for good.Skip forward a couple of centuries.A priest that just retired from aiding him, a friend, gets killed, setting off a chain of events meant to upset the balance and instigate an all-out war by witches against humans and the last witch hunter is the only one there to stop it.So, what do we have here? Characters I love and want to survive. Fighting, magic, potions, depravity, a good witch that's about to be every teenage boy's celebrity crush (and grown guys just make pretend they don't care, uh-huh, really) and some dead that turn out not to be so dead or really they're dead, or maybe not.And he drives a fast car.

It's not a good movie, per se, but it's a fun concept with interesting visuals. It is a little difficult to relate to a protagonist who can't die, isn't scared of anything and shows very little emotion. Even though I probably won't watch this movie again nor recommend it to others, I enjoyed the viewing experience enough."
" Typical and clich√©, bad characterbuilding, no tension and predictable
",-0.7906,0.9589,2019-09-28 00:00:00,4,"To start, the idea is actually pretty cool... So was the intro. The world building seems pretty awesome, too. They establish some rules which kind of make sense. The main character being known to the world and not having any worries as he is immortal, was handled well. There's also a nice ""no-nonsense"" vibe about the main character which fits having lived for 800 years. The effects were pretty cool, too! However, this does not weigh up against the big list of negatives;There is absolutely no tension whatsoever. Every matter is resolved within no time, decisions are made within literal seconds and any issues that arise from it are resolved in similar fashion.The characters jump from point A to B like snapping your fingers. They have 0 characterbuilding and 0 independence. They are being moved by the plot and sometimes they just make decisions without the plot even demanding it as if it's jammed down your throat. It makes no sense.Vin Diesel was really good in the non-fighting scenes, but he just couldn't pull off the action-hero. Honestly, he just could not carry this movie and I'd say he's been misscast as the main character.The relationship between Chloe and Kaulder was also extremely rushed. It makes absolutely no sense how quickly they were in it together and how much they cared for each other in a matter of what... hours? Again, coming back to the snap decisions and absolutely no building of characters or tension.This movie could have been so much more. The intro makes it seem like such a serious movie but that just adds to the negative surprise when watching further.In my opinion, just watch the intro. Maybe another 20-30 minutes for some world-building if you want. Now imagine the rest of the movie and I guarantee it'll be better than what they did with it."
" Ok film, nothing spectacular or great but decent entertainment
",0.4859,0.98,2019-09-13 00:00:00,4,"Do you ever wonder why you enjoyed movie more in the theatre than when you bought it on blu ray it home? We all know films are more exciting and exhilirating when watching them in the theatre (i.e. more immersive). The simple answer of course as to why our viewing experiences are better in theatres than at home has to do with the limitations of our media to view it at home (TV's, blu ray playes, home theatre systems, etc.). With the advancements of todays technologies in televisions now days such as high resolution TVs (4k's and beyond), improved media formats (blu ray, 4k UHD) and frame rate manipulation (24P vs 60P) etc., among many other features, this has brought us closer than we've ever been to being able to match theatre qualities that ultimately give us that same immersive experience. Unfortunately some new features of todays tech can actually hurt the viewing experience as well. Your setup is going to be vital to how you experience a film and ultimately what you thougt of it. You may be telling yourself ""well duh, everyone knows that, so whats your point?"" The point I'm trying to make is that not everyone knows this and may have an improper setup when writing a reviews on a film. This is especially concerning to me when I see reviews suggesting films were ""bad,"" ""outdated,"" or ""what were they thinking, people actually thought this was good."" Case in point, PLEASE, make sure you have the proper settings when viewing films before making a review on it as it can most certainly effect what you thought of it.I am a film lover and nothing brings me more satisfaction than to see others experience that same level joy as I do. Conversely, nothing upsets me more than to see a good film get torn to shreds due to an inadequate setup. So instead of giving you my 2 cent review of a film, since there are so many good reviewers out there already, I will simply rate the film and state whether I thought it was good, bad, ok or excellent and tell you how I watched it. Obviously settings are subjectable to each setup and individual perspective and I am in no way shape or form suggesting that my way is the only correct way but rather this is how I enjoyed it and you might like it that way too."
" Pleasantly surprised
",0.6124,0.9435,2019-08-27 00:00:00,8,"I've been putting off this movie for a long time, mostly because of Vin Diesel as the main character. I love this genre so I decided to give it a shot one boring afternoon. I figured it had to have some merit with the likes of Michael Cain, Elijah Wood, and Rose Leslie.I must say the movie held my attention, and I was pleasantly surprised by the overall plot. Vin Diesel wasn't horrible, but he wasn't all that great either. I would love to see this film with a different protagonist like a Viggo Mortensen or David Tennant. I would even take Duane Johnson over Vin Diesel!If you're a fan of this genre, I would say give it a watch."
" Worth Watching...
",0.2263,0.9259,2019-08-26 00:00:00,7,"If only for the sake of Rose Leslie, the beautiful and versatile Scottish actress from Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones. Leslie brings real acting chops to whatever she does, including this entertaining if not brilliant witch flick. Honestly, I watched it because of the cast, headed by Vin Diesel, who was surprisingly sympathetic, and Elijah Wood (Frodo Forever!). Michael Caine also plays a small but key role and adds just enough tongue-in-cheek gravitas to elevate the movie. The story isn't new or brilliant, but it is fun as far as supernatural good versus evil goes. I gave it a 7, one click above its average, to acknowledge the work of the cast, which proves that good actors can make even middling material into something better than it would be without them."
" Make Sure this is the Last Witch Hunter
",-0.0516,-0.5274,2019-07-31 00:00:00,5,"The Last Witch Hunter was very formulaic and dull.Vin Diesel plays Kaulder a witch hunter from the middle ages. I'm saying middle ages but I don't know for sure. When were the Vikings prominent because he looked like a Viking. In any case; he and his squad were hunting the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) because she had released the black plague on mankind.*That's another clue: he looked like a Viking, the black plague was killing people and it was 800 years ago.Klauder was able to corner the Witch Queen and deliver a fatal blow with his sword. Before she expired she ""cursed"" him with immortality. 800 years later he's still hunting witches but there is a better relationship between witches and humans. Witches do their own thing, not bothering humans, and the witch hunter leaves them alone.Because Hollywood lacks imagination they figured out a way to bring the Witch Queen back to life. Again, because Hollywood lacks imagination, there was a girl brought into the picture who would have to fall in love with the hero. For a third time I say, because Hollywood is trite, there was a betrayal. And for the last time, because Hollywood is lazy, the hero is near the brink of death before mustering up the strength to deliver that precious kill shot.Man was this movie a dud. It certainly didn't help to have Vin Diesel as the lead. He makes Keanu Reeves look like a Tony award winner. The Last Witch Hunter really needs to be the last witch hunter. Do not reprise this."
" Underrated Vin Diesel movie worthy of a digital rental
",0.4404,0.872,2019-07-28 00:00:00,6,"When this movie came out in the fall of 2015, it did good business despite getting wrecked by critics. Most recently this film has gained a cult following due to heavy rotation on tv and a discount price for rental on Google Play. Starring Vin Diesel as the main character who fights witches, along with supporting roles form Rose Leslie and Anthony Hopkins as he nears retirement soon after the Transformers misfire. The sound mix is good and the effects are well done. The ending leaves it open for a sequel, which didn't happen due to the lackluster box office of the film."

Firstly, I don't believe Vin Diesel was a wise choice as the protagonist. He looks and sounds the same in every film, he might as well have been Dominic Toretto without fast cars... I also didn't find Rose Leslie a strong enough actress to portray Chloe.Regarding the visual effects, wow, they really do have A LOT of effects in this film. Some of the effects reminded me of 1999's 'The Mummy', and a bit of 'Highlander', too. Towards the end it really became CGI-heavy.The film became confusing jumping forward and backward in time through dreams and memories. The plot was incoherent and a lot happened for effect only. The story seems to invent magic for the characters to use as the plot requires them. It felt way too convenient and not believable. In general 'The Last Witch Hunter' was entertaining enough for a once off viewing. Not sure I'd watch it again in a hurry, though."

" Pedestrian horror sorta-superhero starring Vin Diesel
",-0.5719,-0.8795,2019-05-02 00:00:00,4,"An 800 year-old immortal Witch Hunter (Vin Diesel) now lives in swank New York City, still hunting malevolent witches with the help of two priests, an aged one (Michael Caine) and a novice (Elijah Wood). Rose Leslie plays a winsome witch with mettle while √ìlafur Darri √ìlafsson is on hand as a formidable evil warlock.I thought I'd like ""The Last Witch Hunter"" (2015) since it mixes ""End of Days"" (1999) with ""Van Helsing"" (2004) and elements of ""Ghost Rider"" (2007) and ""The Mummy"" (1999) but, while Vin Diesel towers in the lead role, the story is meh. The overblown intro with its CGI-laden witch grotto sequence wasn't a good first impression. By the halfway mark I wanted to turn it off, but I persevered.Everything is here for a quality movie of this sort, but the story isn't captivating and doesn't build any drive. It just goes through the motions. The script needed a serious rewrite. But Vin Diesel is charismatic as the witch-hunting 'James Bond' and redhead Leslie has some appeal.The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh and Southern Cal.GRADE: C/C- (4.5/10)"
" The Last Witch Hunter offers a plague of fantastical visual effects yet eternally damns all to boredom.
",-0.6124,0.9124,2019-04-23 00:00:00,4,"If you told me that Vin Diesel would be cast as a witch slayer who is cursed with eternal life, I would've joked that his other 'Fast & Furious' family member Dwayne Johnson was cast as a CGI scorpion monstrosity. Oh, wait a minute...! Anyway, back to the witch hunt, fantasy adventures are my bread and butter with a light spreading of fantastical flavoursome jam. But only when the adventure is thrilling, characters are infectiously entertaining and the medium of film is put to maximum usage. This disposable start to a forced franchise succumbs to the symptom that most modern fantasy flicks contain. Emptiness. We see a witch hunter, the last apparently (who knew!), tasked in saving the world from the Witch Queen who has recently been resurrected.Incoming special effects, visualised environments and Diesel's deep mumbling voice. The first two factors are well executed, with many creatures and dream-like worlds looking surprisingly realistic exhuming that magical quality. The world building is thick with much of the dialogue cementing the foundations of the lore. Order of the Axe and Cross, Dolans and the Witch Council. This inevitably leaves no room for, yes you guessed it, character development.Kaulder is emotionless thanks to Diesel's terrible miscasting. His niche charm just does not work for this genre, in my opinion. He is accompanied by a witch named Chloe, performed by Leslie who singlehandedly uses her wit and comedic execution to save the film, who conveniently has a ridiculous amount of spells and abilities to save Kaulder whenever he is in peril such as dream-walking. Essentially negating any thrills. Caine is quickly replaced by Wood as the friendly neighbourhood priest who only exists for a specific plot point in the third act, which was abhorrently unnecessary.Suffice to say I wanted this to be good. The time is right for a new fantasy franchise to hit our screens, sadly this is not the one. The Last Witch Hunter has rapidly hunted its last witch."
" Not bad
",0.431,0.793,2019-04-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie was okay. I must first comment on the brilliant makeup and special effects. The acting was pretty good. The story line wasn't as good as I had hoped for it to be, however it is cool that some scenes took place in the middle ages and then in present day New York. There was a little plot twist but nothing truly mind blowing."

It feels like the studio execs sat around the big table and thought here's Vin Diesel lets build a boisterous popcorn franchise setting piece around him.Plot has Diesel as the title character who here in the modern world is all that stands between humanity and the combined forces of the deadliest witches in history. Cue lots of crash bang and wallop, digital blitzkrieg and Vin with a glint in his eye, this in spite of not having the emotional paths required for the role. In support are Elijah Wood, Michael Caine and Rose Leslie, all of whom arguably come under the miscast banner.There's some smart ideas at the film's core, the nightmares and dreamscapes narrative smarts particularly hint at what might have been a potent asset to the pic. There's some nifty set-pieces on show as well, which just about stops this from being a boring picture - but it comes mightily close - and in HD form it looks and sounds terrific. Yet sadly it's never a fully realised whole for dramatic impact, with the casting decisions only compounding this feeling.In nutshell terms The Last Witch Hunter is a passable time waster that entertains if one is in an undemanding mood. 5/10"

" Swords & Guns - action fantasy, which probably feels like you've seen it before.
",0.3612,-0.8519,2018-09-17 00:00:00,6,"Starring Vin Diesel as Kaulder, a witch hunter, this film is an action/fantasy cross over. Kaulder (Vin Diesel) is made immortal by the Witch Queen, a punishment for killing her - to go through life, never having closure with nobody who can share experiences with for long. Fast Forward some 1000+years and Kaulder is in modern day America, still fighting the witches, or at least, policing them - as a truce exists between witches and humans. A new threat emerges from the old world and Kaulder has to work out where and who the threat is, in order to stop it. This film wasn't as cheesy as I anticipate, it's got enough pace and action to keep things going. There are plenty of stars in the film, from Michael Caine, Elijah Wood and Rose Lesley to name a few, and the action is generally a tasteful mix of live action and CGI. The issue I had was that it felt as though I'd seen the plot unfold in other films before, in fact, ten minutes into it I turned to my girlfriend and provided a potential ending, which turned out to be a spoiler as it came true. Lots of clich√©s, lots of tongue in cheek moments, lots of Vin Diesel doing the same he's done in other movies. If you like sword and gun action which mixes action with fantasy, you'll love this. I thought it was average and missed an opportunity to be better. 6 out of 10."

I loved the visual effects that were used a lot throughout the whole movie, they were colourful, the nature environment was beautiful and I also liked how original the Queen Witch looked. I liked the gothic setting in the visions from the past, I liked how the story was slowly revealing itself as the movie progressed, altho it was confusing at some points because of that. The only negative aspect was the lack of quality action scenes, but we've all seen a lot of Vin Diesel in action, so who needs them here anyway."

The acting is bad, the story will not impress even a 10 year old and characters are flat. CGI was okay, but that hardly helps. 
Hopefully there won't be any sequel."
" Riddick In The Light... 'ish...
",0.0,0.9958,2018-02-14 00:00:00,6,"So way back when witches roamed the land so did Witch Hunters. Kaulder (Diesel) and his gang are hinting the Witch Queen who is intent on the destruction of the human race. The battle between Queen and mortals is fast and furious with everyone but Kaulder and the Queen being slain. In a last ditched attempt, Kaulder attacks and runs her through with his sword of fire. However, as witches are accustomed, she doesn't die easily... she curses Kaulder to immortality. However, judging by the notches on his bedpost this curse has backfired on the witch because it looks like he's enjoying life... not only does he have the women, but he has his own toys, fast cars, and a penthouse... when can I get cursed that bad(?)So this is pretty much a Vin Diesel vehicle and to be honest, it's kinda like Riddick without the contact lenses. There's at least an air of a mystery in the story, something is happening in the magic community and it's not good. What's happening? Who's behind it? What's the twist? All good questions, though all, are pretty easy to figure out. Mainly, because it's all been done before and maybe they didn't want to get too complicated and confusing as the film is aimed at a 12A audience. Any adult should know where this story is going and all the twist reveals well in advance of their actual reveal.Vin Diesel once again does a great job at being Vin Diesel... I would love to see him stretch his acting wings to take in a few more characterisations... or is he gonna be like Bruce Willis stuck in a rut being John McClane in every film he does? Can anybody remember when he was Hudson Hawk... But I digress, then you have Rose Leslie as Chloe... she's a strange one as sometimes she's great, then at others, a lump of wood. Similar can also be said for Elijah Wood as Dolan 37th (shouldn't that be The 37th Dolan or Dolan 37?). Most of the time he's on screen he gives out an appearance of uncaring. It's like he didn't want to be there. Other than Diesel, the only other actors who do well with their characters are Olafsson as Belial, brilliant as the hulk of a warlock, who is certain of his power and his mission. Michael Caine as Dolan 36th, a cheeky priest who has befriended Kaulder over his tenure. However, it's the direction, the special effects, and action scenes that will keep the audience entertained the most. Eisner is a good director and uses both camera shots, angles, pans, and lighting to his best advantage. It's also nice that he decided to keep the dark subterranean scenes well lit so you can see the action. It's also refreshing that in the action scenes he doesn't always opt for shaky cam. But, uses quick pans and cuts to add speed, tension, and excitement... phew, no seasickness pills needed.If the story had been stronger and some of the characters slightly upgraded it would have made this a much better venture. As it is, it's a leave your brain by the door, magical slobber knocker. Not too bad a way to waste an hour and a half... though if you're looking for original, this isn't it... or thought-provoking.I would recommend this to all viewers who want a not-all-together mindless entertainment. It's a one watch movie."

What viewers actually get is a showy mess that makes one wonder how such cookie-cutter drivel ever gets the green-light in the first place.Star Vin Diesel is forgettable as Kaulder, a witch-hunter who was cursed centuries ago with immortality by a witch queen (Julie Engelbrecht), and who has spent his everlasting life hunting down those who practise dark magic. Michael Caine plays Kaulder's church sanctioned assistant Dolan 36th who is killed by an evil sorceror, and Elijah Wood is his replacement, Dolan 37th, who joins Kaulder in the search for those who seek to resurrect the witch queen. Also lending a hand is good witch Chloe (Rose Leslie).After lots of confusing, special effects driven action and dreary supernatural drama, the film ends in a manner that suggests it was intended to be the beginning of a franchise. Given how poorly the movie was received, I think that there is a witch's chance in Salem of that happening."

",0.0,-0.5881,2017-07-19 00:00:00,4,"From terrible editing to pacing of the script and scenes, this movie just feels so weird.I liked the CGI. The visuals obviously had a lot of effort put into them and Vin Diesel works fine in his role without overdoing it, but the movie never really delivers on what you're expecting from it (you know, a lot of witch-hunting).The whole world is populated with witches but our hero apparently takes humane approach and only kills those that ""break the law"" or some rule which you as a viewer don't give a sh*t about. While we're at it, using Vin Diesel as a action hero is fine, but making him deliver lines next to actors who actually act is painful to see (that butler from Batman especially). Also, Elijah Wood's character is just underdeveloped and the movie forgets about it until the ""twist"" (which won't be a shock to anyone). Personally I think they should've casted someone with more sinister face in his place.Then there are random cuts, which happen because they either re-shot those scenes without caring much for continuity or cause the editor was just high on cocaine. Either way, they are jarring. What is even more jarring is the speed with which the whole plot flows jumping from scene to scene without developing anything lore-wise or character-wise.Movie is so-so. Watchable if you have nothing else to see since CGI and action scenes are well done (though action isn't really that amazing)."

Vin Diesel couldn't save this movie even if he tried. We got some big actors, but they couldn't have done anything to make this film interesting either. The battle scenes were boring. The storyline was generic. The movie is just terrible. Kaulder is a witch-hunter cursed with immortality by the Witch Queen. They couldn't even come up with a more cool name for the queen? When Kaulder and the Witch Queen met again, she took back her curse of immortality. In the end, when Kaulder killed the Witch Queen again, a witch friend of his stopped him from destroying the heart because he would die. WHY WOULD HE DIE? The Witch Queen didn't cast the curse of immortality on him for the second time. Destroying the heart wouldn't have killed him at all, so what the heck?

The actors were great, the plot was good, the magic and witches refreshed - more in the buff and chant, less in the glass cannon idea.The main reason I write this review, because of other negative reviews. I do not think that the reviews mirror the reality. So please let me debunk that.The CGI is good, not over-excellent, over the top.. it's CGI. Very good looking, at some places a bit lacking but well edited when it comes to action and chanting. The story is good. Makes the mood, gives you empathy, let's you feel through of it.. yet it goes well with nowadays. Of course it's a 2 hour movie, don't expect world-end, but it has a lot. The world building is also great. We can see the world of witches, the world of man, the collision, the mix. At some places there are moments that make you think, why they do that, how that comes together.. at some other places you see war-thorn witches, very old.. which are just hints as in how did that happen? Would they be black magic users, they would be in prison forever. So it does have that. The characters have development, they work well together. The script is well done, it has seriousness, thoughts, funny moments - ""Let me see you do that with an iPad."" Very good. The actors.. now.. here a lot of people didn't like things. Vin Diesel plays more of the father type in his 50ies, of course without family, which play out very well. Michael Caine does a very good job, you can feel the chemistry but the gap between the worlds. It's a bit distracting, but also good, because it is also written as such. Caine is an old man, probably 60-80ies, typical old British gentleman who lived over his life, adventures, strife, etc. Which clashes with Vin-s character, since he cannot find peace or happiness. Very good. Than comes other characters - no spoilers - they do a very good job. I really liked how both the side characters had their own side feelings, they weren't cast-ed as how they look, but as what they lived. It's a surprise. Really liked Rose-s playfulness, good movements, body language. Elijah did excellent. He will surprise you too - again no spoiler - with his strong standing up and hardened stature.I don't really have more to say. It's very well done, and I really enjoyed it. I recommend it."
" The Last Witch Hunter Review
",-0.3612,-0.9847,2017-02-24 00:00:00,6,"I don't know what it is about The Last Witch Hunter, but for some reason it was really hard for me to get into this movie. Allow me to explain¬ÖSynopsis: The modern world holds many secrets, but the most astounding secret of all is that witches still live amongst us; vicious supernatural creatures intent on unleashing the Black Death upon the world. Armies of witch hunters battled the unnatural enemy across the globe for centuries, including Kaulder, a valiant warrior who managed to slay the all-powerful Queen Witch, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the Queen curses Kaulder with her own immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter in the afterlife. Today Kaulder is the only one of his kind remaining, and has spent centuries hunting down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost loved ones. However, unbeknownst to Kaulder, the Queen Witch is resurrected and seeks revenge on her killer causing an epic battle that will determine the survival of the human race. Starring: Vin Diesel, Rose Leslie, Elijah Wood Director: Breck EisnerFirst thing, let's start with a good thing. The story is, in my opinion, an exceptional story. An immortal man is only living to rid the world of witches and warlocks. Who wouldn't like a storyline like that? Yes, it is a fantasy movie with elements of horror and action and comedy, but it is still a good story.I don't know about the setting, but it worked in the favor of the movie. NYC is the hub for commerce in the entire world. So why wouldn't the witches and warlocks base all their operations out of the biggest hub in the world? It would have been nice to see someplace a bit smaller for this setting, but I can understand.As for the acting, it just seemed like most of the actors phoned their roles in. The only exception to this is Rose Leslie. I've never seen her in a movie before, but she owned her role as Chloe. The worse one of the main cast was Elijah Wood. He didn't play the part in the right way it seemed like. You could something was up from the second he came into the movie.Now, I like Vin Diesel movies, and this was one of his movies. It was made completely around him. I don't think this movie would have been made (even though it should have) without him in the lead role. Although, he did seem out of place in the movie.If you have about an hour and forty minutes to kill, you can give this movie a gander. But don't go out of your way to do so. It's not a bad movie, it's just not a must see either.Rating: 6 out of 10"
