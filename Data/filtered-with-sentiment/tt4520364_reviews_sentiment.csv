",0.0,0.6692,2021-04-11 00:00:00,4,"Because, Luke, you're wasting amazing talent and their awesome performance with this amazingly stupid story. I am watching one stupid decision to the next from ""supposedly"" brilliant scientists and a professional assassin. Amazing actors like Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Toby Jones have nothing to do, yet they still shine with what little they have. Giamatti has quite an ""okay"" chance to shine and he performs the $#1+ out of it. So, yeah, the four stars are for the actors, because the writing is so bad that it makes everything other than the actors really bad."

" Hmmmmmmm
",0.0,0.9286,2021-03-15 00:00:00,7,"I remember not thinking much of this film the first time I saw it, but I've just watched it again and it was much better than I recalled.Maybe I've come to appreciate certain members of the cast a bit more, or maybe my expectations were very low?Either way I recommend it."
" A film of two halves. Your emotions got you killed!
",-0.6996,0.5218,2021-03-13 00:00:00,7,"'Morgan' starts really well with an interesting premise, a secret AI program being visited by a corporate investigator called in after the AI in question (Morgan, an artificially created but biological human) starts to go a bit crazy, and things aren't quite right with the way the scientists are running the program. The first third of the film is a good analysis of what is and isn't human, the science of the project, and started to remind me a bit of Bladerunner, especially the psych evaluation (which also goes badly wrong). The only thing that is problematic in the first half is that the scientists are all very annoying and pretty stupid (what is it with the Scott's for writing idiot characters?) but oddly enough that actually works out well later on as you will see...Suddenly though the film breaks into an fight/action movie, with faux martial arts fights and several vicious slaughters as Morgan breaks out. To be honest though at that point I had had enough of the overly liberal and overly emotional scientists and their desire to protect Morgan at any cost (even after she's killed someone) and I wanted them all dead. The most satisfying thing is... that's exactly what happens, she kills them all! Their stupid emotional attachment to Morgan is their downfall, and I was pretty much cheering Morgan on at this point as she butchered them in various interesting ways. Inevitably there is the final boss fight at the end, and a couple of unexpected executions and one extremely satisfying one. Never in a film have I ever wanted to see a character die so badly as Amy, the 'behaviorist'. That felt good.There is a slight 'twist' at the end, although it's easy to guess what that is nearer the start and certainly easy to spot once the fighting starts.I'm giving it 7/10 rather than 5/10 because I'm glad Luke Scott killed off all the annoying characters (his dad should take a leaf out of his book here).The two lead women were brilliant. With Anya Taylor Joy bringing the same other-worldy presence she displayed in Split and The Witch, and Kate Mara was superb as Lee Weathers, and that character should get a film sequel in my opinion."

" How far would science go?
",0.0,-0.823,2021-02-23 00:00:00,7,"An artificially created thing develops feelings thanks to the new programming for the project. In a fit of anger it injures one of their programmers.
Now a psychologist must determine if the project should be eleminated. For that a risk-management consultant is there.
But everything goes wrong...Now this movie could ask the question: Should science be allowed to create new life.....and than eleminate it if the result is not what they seek.
For a few moments there was this possibility for the movie....but than the action
takes over. Sad, because everything was there...childhood memories, troubled scientists a very emotional scene seconds before it would be poisoned.
In the end this is nothing more than another action movie....and for that it deserves my voting (7).The plot twist....meeeeh, after watching a few minutes I knew what's up with the
oh so correct consultant.You can watch the movie, but don't expect a profound story..."
" This is the perfect movie for Bill Gates and many Democrats.
",0.5719,-0.9764,2021-02-17 00:00:00,1,"See, this film takes the premise that humans are imperfect, so let's go 'make' a 'better' one! We'll use lots of 'software' -- yeah -- that'll do it! Then, oops, those naughty nanites decided to re-program themselves. Well, that's okay, we'll just grow this creature, then ask it how it 'feels'. (just like Democrats) They give ""it"" 'directives' -- no mention was ever made as to what those directives were, though. (The movie completely ignores Isaac Asimov's ""Three Laws of Robotics."")Then, the scientists fall in love with their 'fantastic' 'creation' -- ala Dr. Frankenstein -- and cannot see past treating the thing they created as an actual human being.Throughout the movie, no concept of God or Morals was ever mentioned. (Gee, just like our Public Schools!) Then (apparently) everyone is surprised and shocked when their Frankenstein Monster turns on them and begins killing them! My, my, what a surprise. Then, all the 'scientists' try to reason with their nanites, to no avail of course. The nanites figure out what fake response is required, then IT (just some stupid nanites, remember) mirror that expected response. So, the Stupid Humans then think: Well, IT has learned from this experience; but IT has not. Then, when the Frankensein Monster is finally killed, then the Corporate Cleaning Crew, in the person of our main character, does what any corporation does -- kill everyone involved, destroy all the evidence, and move on.Oh, 'fun' film! ... ... NOT!"
" You did not get it, or just plain missed it.
",-0.296,0.7408,2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"I see a bunch of people reviewing this movie and they try to compare it to Ex-Machina. As if that was the point of this movie, only about AI. Well, it was and it wasn't. I also see a lot of people stating how bland Kate Mara was in this movie, as if she cannot act. I think you need to watch this title again, because her acting is based of the character she was playing. The writers and the directors showed their hands, more than once, on what Lee Weathers is (played by Kate Mara). So, if you do not want to watch the entire movie again, I get it, just watch the last 5 minutes of it again. Especially the part where she (Lee Weathers), is sitting in the dinner all by herself and corporate is discussing her. So, yes it is about AI, but the twist of who or what Lee Weathers REALLY is, that is what you did not see. I liked this movie, I found it to have many layers to it. The writer did not want to make another Ex-Machina, and I actually like both of them. They are different from each other in so many ways, which is good, because I don't want to see the same movie with just different actors."
" Could have been so much better
",0.4902,0.9677,2021-01-18 00:00:00,7,"Visually splendid with a great first act, the movie had the potential to be something great. The then less-known Anya Taylor-Joy offers a great performance well supported by Kate Mara and the rest of the cast. Sadly the quality of the writing goes south in the last third of the movie. It could have been so much better."
" A great sci fi script, but lacked wow elements.
",0.8294,0.9522,2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,"The movie is a very interesting one. The beginning is but slow, which could have been better. The story demanded a little more action in the first half of the movie but is was quite simple.
Second half is more gripping. The movie is a very intellectual storyline, the ending steals the show. The passion and feelings are shown quite nicely. A better execution of this story could have made this movie a hot cake."
" Lazy writing, but not a horrible waste of time
",0.7204,0.9913,2021-01-17 00:00:00,5,"Morgan is film that failed because it didn't know what it wanted to be. It doesn't have the boldness to justify as a R-rated horror thriller, nor does it have an intelligent screenplay to accompany its themes of an AI psych thriller - both of which it was trying to go for.In the film, Lee Weathers (Kate Mara), a ""risk-management specialist"", is called to evaluate whether or not the company she works for, SynSect, is to terminate a humanoid being hosted at a rural site. The project refers to the humanoid as Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy). And from the trailer, we see that Morgan shows concerning behavioral traits - including an incident wherein she stabs one of her doctors in the eye - which is why ""corporate"" has to step in. The doctors all seem to love Morgan, referring to her violent actions as honest mistakes. However, Lee Weathers is only there to do a job and doesn't seem to have any interest in humanizing Morgan. She is just there to weigh the risk of keeping the project afloat.This film is not intelligent, especially considering others films in the same genre such as Ex Machina and the brilliant HBO series Westworld which released around the same time. The characters who all take care of Morgan seem to have developed a love for her, but the direction of the film doesn't lead the viewer to contemplate the relationships between genetically created organisms and humans. This is really just about a kick-ass robot (they don't explain why it can kick ass either). It had a great cast, good action sequences, and a satisfying ending which may have been obvious and predictable to some. Also, Paul Giamatti shows up halfway through the film to do a straight up ask-questions shoot-later psych evaluation. He has an excellent performance, although given the circumstance, his character made some questionable decisions.I admit one of the primary reasons I watched till the end was Kate Mara (yeah, I have a bit of celeb crush on her not gonna lie). She is great in the film throughout. And Anya Taylor-Joy is excellent in her role as well. She does a fascinating portrayal of a machine displaying human emotions and human misunderstanding of them. I'm thrilled to see her continue on to great lead roles. Kate Mara needs to be in more films. I especially liked her in American Horror Story: Murder House as the crazed ex-lover and homewrecking patient, Hayden.I like to see that Ridley Scott's kids are doing their thing. I suggest they keep experimenting with the artform. That said, Morgan is an experiment that could have succeeded, but underwhelmingly failed."
" Big idea but shallow way of story telling
",0.0,0.9134,2021-01-02 00:00:00,6,"Black technology is always my favourite genre. And AI related story definetely gonna be a hype for the coming years.I would say the framework of Morgan is good, but the way they execute the idea is shallow. The bonding between the research team and Morgan is weak, what is the meaning of special? Why Morgan is special? How special she could be? No. We don't know, so we the audience cannot feel resonate.The story development in first 30 minutes is good, subtle and fine, but the following hour is going south, directionless and clueless, too much fight scene too little proper interaction. It is a great waste for such a good idea. The idea could outwit many commercial big film, but end up as a mediocre."
" What's the difference between intelligence and consciousness
",0.4767,0.993,2020-12-15 00:00:00,8,"I just watched the movie, and - wow!
first of all: avoid to watch a trailer and any spoilers of the story, to have the best film experience. this review contains no spoilers.Morgan is a brilliant science fiction movie with a lot of realism in it and great acting. though the following text seems to be very theoretical, it is an intense thriller. to me there was not a single boring minute.the movie shows, how complicated it is, to create artificial human like consciousness. it shows the problems which come along with it, when a learning AI is allowed, to make decisions. And if an AI is aware of the fact, their decisions have consequences for themselves and others, then it's one step closer to the point of being conscious.creating human like consciousness is not a challenge of creating intelligence. not at all. human technology already has reached the point of better AI than human intelligence. And it will increase exponentially in the near future. in fact, intelligence has little effect on creating human like consciousness. there is a lot more what it takes. actually it's all of the things beside intelligence, which make the difference. which create consciousness and personality. our personality is the thing that tells us, what decision is the right one. to be conscious means, being aware of the fact, that our decisions have consequences for our existence, and for others. but what creates our personality? it is the result of real life experiences and how to handle them. It gets extremely complicated when we try to compute that. And it's incredibly hard when it comes to compassion, empathy, morality and conscience, how to handle our feelings and the feelings of others. experience of social interaction creates an ego which is also needed to build up a personality. all of these things make the difference between a conscious human being and a machine of pure intelligence. intelligence is the easy part. this is, what the movie is about. go and watch it, if you are interested in these things. you won't be disappointed."

" As usual people overthink it, this is a GREAT scifi thriller!!!
",0.7969,0.9867,2020-11-03 00:00:00,9,Sure it's short and every now and then I like adding a scifi to my collection that's not 2 and a half +++ hours!! They usually over do it and you have over an hour of character development and that's good sometimes but sometimes I just want to get to the point and the action and that's this movie. It's not an oscar contender and it doesn't try to be that. It's a excellent scifi thriller with excellent acting by the 2 main characters . The ending was slightly predictable but no one could guess the exact ending so nice try saying you did!! I highly recommend watching this if you want a short excellent well made film!!!
" Could have been better but it's watchable.
",0.2382,-0.0433,2020-09-14 00:00:00,6,"Overal Morgan is watchable but the story clearly had more potential. A story about an artificially created humanoid being, it's not that we never saw something similar before, but that's the case for most movies. I thought it all fell a bit bland in the end. There are some flaws that bring down the credibility of the movie, for example when a normal car rams an iron gate you expect to have some severe damage at the front of your car, and in this case the car was scratchless. It's those kind of little details that bring down the quality of a movie. The acting was okay, nothing mindblowing but nothing cringing either. The quality of the images was good, looked all professional but that's not a guarantee for a good movie. I watched Morgan without much joy or suspense, just another movie I will forget everything about it in a couple days."
" Stunning movie

" Sleeper
",0.0,0.8033,2020-08-06 00:00:00,7,This is a very good movie. The bad reviews focus on expectations. Morgan is not a blockbuster by any stretch but it is clearly above average fair for sci-fi flick. It deserves better than the 5.8 on IMBD's scale and much better than the bad reviews listed here.
" Nothing remarkable here
",-0.4449,-0.5646,2020-06-23 00:00:00,5,"The TV presenter promised ""old school sci-fi/horror"" but I wouldn't go that far. For a movie about artificial intelligence it is not highly intelligent itself. It is a pretty slow burn at first, then it culminates in plenty of violence including girl on girl martial arts fight scenes, plus an ending that was satisfactory but I saw it coming. Kate Mara reminded me of Posh Spice, Victoria Beckham, so that didn't really help!"
" Things wrong with this film:
",-0.4767,-0.9759,2020-05-06 00:00:00,4,"Ill just write out everything that is wrong with the film. If you see these as non-issues then by all means enjoy the movie~Actual Plot: SynTech sends out a fixer from risk management to evaluate and clean up when an android attacks one of the scientist care-takers.(the name is only said in the film, never written out for you. I spelled it this way for Synthetic and Technology though it could be SinTech because they are 'playing god' if you will by trying to create synthetic life) ...Issues i found with the film:1) the scientists: theyre not very scientisty. theyre in love with the android. they arent shown becoming attached to the synthetic as it grows other than ONE of them and shes a behaviorist so that would be the obvious pick. this is their 'first success' but they for whatever reason treat this droid like the golden child when according to their science they figured it out and should be able to reproduce this outcome infinitely, making the droid even less significant and important i.e. no reason to not be detached enough to not get murdered.2) the risk management / clean up detail: she doesnt fit the part. her dialogue is fine, but her actions dont really reflect her objective. the film tries to hide the truth from you but does it in a way that seems obvious and as a result pretty much screams out what is going to happen far too early. Why does she need a gun if all she is there to do is evaluate and make a recommendation?? Yes there was an incident but the incident didnt in any way imply a lack of security and safety.. which was compounded by the fact that the synth was contained in an enclosure and had not tried to escape.3) the synthetic. why is she always wearing that stupid hood. why did they make her look fake when she was actually more human / organic than not. they just tricked an egg into thinking it was fertilized which still would have meant real skin etc. why was she so lame in combat despite being 'weaponized'? the film only tells you she has 'weaponized protocol' after she starts killing people. they try to focus on the droids humanity but its a weapon but they dress and treat her like she is not human. there is a conflict here with 'it has a soul' and 'its obviously being treated as not having a soul, which you can see in how they treat it'. had she wore normal clothes and had a more normal looking living quarters the attachment to her by the scientists might have been more believable rather than the drab 5 year old wool hoodie and concrete everything-else. also, shes killing everyone for keeping her like a 'thing' despite her having free access to roam about prior to the incident. meaning, the people she is killing never really did anything wrong to her, she didnt hate them, and when they did confine her she had already hurt someone. the one person she didnt try to kill didnt do anything more or less bad or good to her than anyone else. and in fact, you dont even see the affection from that character to that degree, while you do see it from others who she is quick to exterminate. very contradictory.4) objective. did the film want to be a deep thought scifi or an action film? it couldnt decide and fails at being either. it tries to ask a few deep questions, or present ideas in a complex and thought provoking way but then tramples all over that with bad choices by characters, lack of motive of key players.tldr:in closing, it felt like someone who doesnt watch or read a lot of sci-fi had an idea and tried dipping their toes in, but the water was colder than they thought so despite going knee deep never actually jumped in fully. the action sequences are kinda wack. the android goes from loved child to murder droid without any semblance of motive, and it makes even less sense because youre given a scene that heavily implies mercy and compassion yet just feeds the confusion later when the droid kills those that do obviously care about her and see her as more than a science project. and then, to finish it off, a cliche ending plot twist when the incompetent fixer decides to man up and take action.too predictable, not fleshed out well, and poor character design."
" Interesting concept but execution muddled.
",0.2144,0.8131,2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,"This is an interesting concept of a mixture of the scientific question ""does AI having true thought?"" filtered through the lense of ""does a clone have a soul?"" But, it is designed as a thriller and falls into the trap of corporate paranoia. And the characters also become the standard tropes to fill plot points as well as ""cannon fodder"" for the terror in the thriller plotline. The director is excellent at creating the emotionless characters, but he seemed to decide to create an emotionless film as the canvas for his characters."
" Weak
",-0.4404,-0.9389,2020-04-09 00:00:00,3,"Starts out kind of like an interesting movie, and it gets from bad to worse to why am I watching this ...

Thanks, now I hate that name
Lee is always wearing high heels...
Fighting scenes are lame, and unnecesary, at least in the forest..Lee decides hitting Morgan!! over the head with a rifle, and throwing her in the water so that she can drown her ( while wearing high heels), instead of shooting her...to name oneAll in all, I felt it was a waste watching this.

" Do paranoid androids dream of electric sheep? Nope, of killing their creators!
",0.587,0.9815,2020-01-16 00:00:00,5,"""Morgan"" is the name of an android, a piece of artificial intelligence, created in all secrecy by a team of devout scientists, in a lab somewhere hidden in a remote and forestry region. Before you start praising the downright magnificent make-up effects on the girl, bear in mind it's actress Anya Taylor-Joy's real face. She's a really good and talented young actress, but admittedly she has a bit of a weird face, which - luckily for her - helps to obtain interesting roles as the ""outcast-girl"" (also in ""Split""). Anyways, Morgan is only five years old, but she already looks like an adolescent and she behaves like a spoiled teenager. Lately, there have been serious issues with Morgan, and she even stabbed one of her creators in the eye. Corporate headquarters sends out emotionally numb but highly professional risk-manager Lee Weathers to assess if ""Project Morgan"" should be terminated or not. Needless to say, Morgan's makers grew to love her as if she were a real child, and they will not accept that's she killed based on an evaluation by an outsider. Director Luke Scott (son of Ridley who made the Sci-Fi landmarks ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"") initially tries hard to make ""Morgan"" is a very ambitious, existential and emotionally challenging Sci-Fi/thriller, but he can't prevent that it turns into a rather ordinary 'stalk & slash' type of B-horror. There are a handful of terrific sequences, notably the scene with Paul Giamatti as the obnoxious auditor, but it's ultimately too lightweight to be considered a significant genre effort. Scott Jr. managed to gather an impressive cast (including Brian Cox, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Toby Jones, Paul Giamatti) and the special effects are more than adequate, but I doubt anyone will remember ""Morgan"" in ten years' time."

MORGAN is a case in point. It's about a synthetic human and her interactions with the team of scientists looking after her. This film was made by Ridley Scott's son Luke, who doesn't seem to have inherited much of his dad's panache, although this turns out to be perfectly serviceable as it stands. There are some fun twists and moments of violence that don't hold back, and a particularly distinguished cast that includes Toby Jones, Michelle Yeoh and Jennifer Jason Leigh in various roles; Ridley must have called in a few favours to make this a star-studded production. Kate Mara is a fine lead, and the film, while never wowing, often hits the mark."

" Mediocre result of what should have been good...
",0.0,0.9616,2019-06-26 00:00:00,5,"Granted, while the concept of the storyline told in ""Morgan"" was quite interesting, then the movie fell short somehow. I guess it was because the movie was so generic and predictable. There was nothing offered to the audience throughout the entire course of the movie that you didn't see coming a mile away, well maybe except for the ending of the movie. That, I will admit, I hadn't seen coming.Anya Taylor-Joy, playing Morgan, was actually quite well cast with her inability to portray emotions on the screen. And the make-up department definitely also should have some praise for there was a very distinct non-human like feel emanating from her.The movie actually has some pretty interesting cast members on the list, including the likes of Toby Jones, Brian Cox, Michelle Yeoh and Paul Giamatti. And while they did individually put on good performances, they just weren't able to transcend the mediocrity that permeated the movie given the linear script.I am guessing that writer Seth W. Owen was aiming for a story which was meant to get the audience thinking about artificial life and its impact. But, for me at least, it just didn't manifest or manage to take root. And director Luke Scott was left with a script and storyline that was just, well, bland.""Morgan"" definitely was watchable and semi-enjoyable, but it is hardly a movie that will ever make it to my screen a second time. The movie just scraped by as it was the first time."

Good job, good characters and some really good surprises."
" CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10)
",0.837,0.9943,2019-02-15 00:00:00,8,"The stage curtains open ...A nice sci-fi thriller - kind of a ""Splice"" meets ""Terminator"" action film with some horror elements to it. Very engaging, very entertaining.When a genetic experiment named Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy) attacks one of the attending resident doctors at a hidden facility, a risk management expert, Lee Weathers (Kate Mara), is sent in to begin assessing the situation. Weathers is very calculating, professional and prompt with her job - not exactly making any friends while she is there. Morgan is technically only 5 years old, but has the vocabulary, body and reasoning ability of someone far older. And, as we see later on in the film, some rather excellent fighting skills as well. Morgan is pushed into a corner by another visiting doctor causing her to escape from the facility with Weathers hot on her trail.I had a lot of fun watching this movie. They give you a little twist at the end, but to be honest, I had already figured it out and wasn't really surprised with it. The acting was above average with convincing performances. The action sequences were awesome with some straight up fighting scenes, Jason Bourne style - and the cinematography was very well done. The story was good and the dialogue intelligent. Overall, a very good movie.I highly recommend this one. I was pulled in from the very first minute and it held my attention throughout. Great movie - a hidden gem."

" A Cynical and Amazing Look At A.I. Sci Fi.
",0.296,0.9964,2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"4 September 2016. Ridley Scott's son has put together an icy, cynical, but very intense and psychologically tight sci fi thriller. I assume that many audience members will overlook the superb acting and directing especially when it comes to Morgan, the primary character. What's really difficult to evaluate is the basic underlying premise and twist in the movie which isn't likely to endear audience members with its distinctly anti-audience pleasing expectations. What this movie does as well or better than the best of the scientifically created human movies is the theoretical presentation of the development of a life form that is usually just handled with stereotypical laziness or perhaps better described as underdeveloped primitiveness. Writer Seth Owens and director Luke Scott both put extensive and artful portrayal of artificial life persona into the big screen with both creepy and emotive effectiveness. While Splice (2009) also offered a carefully appealing psychological developmental process of human created life, Morgan offers up an additional covert agenda (with some resemblance to Alien (1979)) as well as an even closer look and vibrant and compelling relational interactions between and among the characters in the movie. Morgan spends more time allowing the audience to experience and absorb and evaluate for ourselves Morgan's existence and its meaning.Albeit, a number of audience members will likely miss the nuances of this movie and reasonably compare it to Event Horizon (2009) or Cube (2009) due to its cynical nature and that's all. Yet a closer experience of Morgan can also reveal even deeper resonating and at the same time frustrating emotions if one compares Morgan to an assassin movie like Hannah (2011) or La Femme Nikita (1990) of which there are similar parallels in character development and the ethical underpinnings as well as conspiracy theories that tie these movies together.Unlike Kurt Russell's sci fi character in Soldier (1998), Morgan presents a rather more complex and more opaque presentation than even Roy Batty's character in Blade Runner (1982). Overall, Morgan is a good addition as well as sometimes an apparent improvement on the vast majority of artificial intelligence movies to date, ranking with the best of them including the more forward looking Ex Machina (2015)(which I found an actress being too human trying to be an artificial life form instead of the other way around)), Transcendence (2014), Lucy (2014), Automata (2014), EVA (2011), and my favorite The Machine (2013)."
" Small Scope Yet Biting
",0.0,-0.4295,2018-11-21 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)This is another one of these films about intertwining emotions around an engineered being. The story revolves around a risk-management consultant assessing whether this engineered human is to be terminated or continue being evaluated. This engineered human is in the form of a teenage girl and as the research team has assesses her, they have grown emotionally attached, thus keeping emotions detached for a proper assessment poses a challenge, surprisingly as this one has an erratic tendency for violent outbursts. Will everyone involved be able to keep feelings at bay to make an unbiased decision? This is a well-produced and fairly well-acted film with doses of some no-nonsense violence. There is a decent twist at the end telegraphed by some clever cinematography earlier on or if you have seen many films with this story, it may not be shocking. Overall, this was a quality execution."

",-0.1154,0.9779,2018-09-04 00:00:00,4,"Morgan is a hybrid movie as much as the title character is a hybrid. Morgan isn't quite sure what it is and neither does this movie.The plot starts of as a ""sci-fi thinker"", there is a scene early on in the movie where Morgan - the humanoid - attacks one of it's creators and a corporate risk-management consultant is called in to evaluate Morgan. The attack scene is seen through a surveillance camera and not very graphic. Kate Mara plays the consultant very stereotypically cold corporate style and we are introduced to rest of the similarily stereotypical cast. A Jamie Oliver style cook, ""hippie"" behaviorist, nerdy scientist etc, bearded and bear like ""good guy"", super stereotypical in an annoying way, like every 90s scifi horror movie. We are also introduced to a psych analyst played by Paul Giamatti and shortly after the movie takes a somewhat unexpected turn into a gorish ""creature horror"".There are so many problems with this movie, but the biggest problem is that you are never sure whether you should like Morgan or not. It's kind of the point of the movie also, will you be fooled by the innocent looks and cute ""childhood"" videos of Morgan or put off by it's horrific actions. But the concept doesn't work, partly because rest of the movie is played as a sci-fi action ""horror"", very stylized all the way to some driving synth soundtrack over martial arts fight scenes. After a slow, but promising first half the movie turns into a super boring Alien style ""horror"" where most of the cast is killed one by one, all the way into a semi surprise ending, which doesn't save the movie tho.The movie and scenery look pretty good, cinematography is quite gorgeous. I was a bit put off by the ""filters"" used quite extensively, like they didn't believe the movie wouldn't look good enough without putting some scenes through an ""instagram filter"".I didn't know this was directed by Ridley Scott's son while watching, but it explains a few things about this movie. First, it has relatively big name cast for a ""small"" movie and also the fact that this has a lot of Ridley legacy to it, borrowing from Alien saga, Bladerunner etc. I guess Luke even went for a similar look his dad has used in many of his movies too.Certainly a missed opportunity. Big names cast, very uneven direction, confusing plot. Kind of an interesting watch, but not really a good or rewarding movie."

And how they explain Morgan's so-called abilities by saying it's intelligence doesn't make sense, because sure she is intelligent but how come she knows everything about you with one glance. And how about they explain what her purpose is a bit more, what is their end goal here? To make an emotionless assassin?
The movie is just one big plot hole."

The trailer made it seem like this was going to be some sort of supernatural thriller with Morgan using telekinesis and so what. In reality this movie is nothing more than an action martial arts movie. You read that right, THIS IS AN ACTION MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE!I actually don't might seeing Kate and Anya engaging in fights during the second half of this movie (This movie is barely 85 minutes, not including credits) because they do a good job with the 2 - 3 fights that they have. The problem is that the fights are so chopped up and quick edited that you end up getting a headache from all the cuts in the fight. The story is interesting at the beginning but loses itself during the second half when it becomes a martial arts action movie. There is really no horror in this movie, and you can't be scared of Morgan because Anya (Actress playing Morgan) is just too good looking of a girl to be scary. Morgan isn't really a force to be afraid of since all she does is threaten people with a handgun, bite people like a dog, and perform martial arts. The characters have ZERO development besides Morgan. Kate Mara has zero character development until the final shot of the movie. The rest of the characters, you know absolutely nothing about. Yeoh is a legendary martial arts actress yet she doesn't even get to showcase her skills in this movie at all. This movie tries to bring in this philosophical element of ""even if Morgan is not human, she feels human emotion so maybe she IS human,"" but it completely abandoned all of that during the second act.Seriously, I am so happy Anya found success in Split because this movie is extremely silly and forgettable. Anya Taylor Joy (Along with the cast) deserves to be in a better film. This is one of the shortest films I have ever seen released on the big screen. It just shows that they had a cool premise but had no idea what to do with it, thus ending it as soon as possible, and with one of the worst death scenes ever for a ""villain.""There is a cool twist with Kate's character during the final shot of the film, but besides that, this movie doesn't need to be seen unless you have 85 minutes to spend. Don't expect anything big out of this, expect a paper thin plot with zero development and a ton of hand to hand fighting between Anya and Kate."

Morgan(Anya Taylor-Joy) appears to be a teenager girl, but she's actually 5 years old. She very intelligent. Her only dark side that she is unpredictable. Cold, aloof, and violent she responded by attacking anyone. Lee Weathers(Kate Mera) travels to the institute to examine Morgan. She does not perceive Morgan as a girl, only as an ""it"". 
Since Morgan was more successful than the others made, and she's just like Morgan, COLD!
This movie could have been better made. Some parts were just too common. Needed more action. Too much killing. The script is weak. Needs more impact. Too obvious.

How they had the subject act and respond was lackluster. The rest of the acting is fine. I think the story's details and background were missing. They did give some back story.

In this case, Morgan is a flesh and bone character with some synthetic genes infused to her DNA and we're expected to consider her a ""thing."" This is outright silly in today's norms where we discuss the human rights of an embryo. We also understand that the first thing all ""humanoids"" excel is martial arts. Despite its pretentious philosophical dressing, the movie is all about Morgan biting off ears and noses, mauling all those crossing her path with the usual blood and gore fest.

The moronic and nonsensical actions of the highly educated staff makes me think the writer believes all of us are this stupid except that the last presidential election has shown otherwise; only half of us are willing to protect someone in the face of certain death and destruction.The moment Lee shoots Amy dead was the highlight of the third act for me.
While everyone apparently followed the ""How to do nothing while a coworker gets mauled to death"" company handbook, Amy was the worst offender of them all.
She had about 4-5 chances to stop Morgan or at least warn others of their impending doom.
Then there's Skip, the useless cook, who had a rifle pointed at Morgan and thought the only reason she was acting this way was because no one had asked her not to.I watched to the end purely out of hope the fine cast would turn this around.

Pick a popular genre, horror. No point in making a movie in a small market, say an Eskimo Sword and Sandal. Pick a script that doesn't need a big budget, no special effects, just a few run of the mill stunts. No big studio sets, film it in the wilderness. Have a small cast, save on payroll. But spend a generous portion of the budget on a good professional cast, but on the other hand you don't need A listers. This is a savvy way you cut your teeth in the movie business.But... the ball was dropped on one crucial guideline, though.

We understand within the film right from the beginning that ""Morgan"" would cause havoc and start causing problems potentially killing others. A clever but obvious twist from the ending was helped to save the film but it did not do much. Overall, Morgan is quite decent but could have been much better, as it is somewhat of a mess. The performance of Morgan played by Anya Taylor-Joy was good, though some issues regarding Kate Mara's performance (though some claim it was intended).

Here's the problem folks: Garbage story, garbage cinematography and quick editing, garbage acting (bunch of nonsense stares), I cannot remember the music so it must have sucked too.Kate Mara, sorry to say it, she just sucks as an actress. I have not seen anything good from her. The fight scenes with her were ridiculous. OK, she turns out to be an engineered human or something. But when she fell off the balcony and kept moving, and the big reveal didn't happen yet, that's when we need to call this what it is, garbage story telling. PLEASE FIND SOME WRITERS WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE! She crashes the car, no problem, gets in another car and continues the chase. She fights Morgan, has her body slammed to the rocks, No problem. She gets impaled, and ends up drowning Morgan. By the way that was just a very stupid scene, boring and down right sleep inducing. Like what the hell is that? Then she kills the girl on the pier and the guy on the road. OK, now the BIG REVEAL. She's an artificial human soldier something. Then we get the scene with the corporate types discussing Kate Mara, that she's the perfect actress and that they will be able to follow this up with a few more movies, because Kate is great, and we can see that Kate is great, because they show Kate being great, not great acting, but just posing. Kate is not an actress. At best she is a fashion model.Anya Taylor-Joy as Morgan was great if you think, blank stares are great. I've read reviews where people are raving about her being the next big actress. Maybe they are the same people who propped Jennifer Lawrence, I don't know. Well, from this performance I don't know how Anya can be anything more than a fashion model.Rose Leslie as Dr. Amy Menser at least showed some fear in her performance. Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dr. Kathy Grieff was completely underused. I only saw the scenes with her eyepatch and her getting killed. Completely underused. Michelle Yeoh as Dr. Lui Cheng looked like a sad joke of acting and character. Paul Giamatti as Dr. Alan Shapiro, I didn't see his scenes, but from reading other reviews he was a psychiatrist who provoked Morgan. This tells me, it's unreal, not professional. And that the Producer/Director = Father/Son = Scott/Scott need to PLEASE FIND SOME WRITERS WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE! I can't comment on the other actors here, they might as well got some people off the street, at least they would have come up with better dialogue than what the writer Seth Owen came up with.So, what we have here is another pile of garbage. While watching it, it can be entertaining. But if you stop to think, the story is garbage. Better to watch the original, Frankenstein 1932. Do not see Bride of Frankenstein. Just the original, Frankenstein.This movie is another representation of our current society. It represents that if you build it they will come. Well, we've come and we've seen what you can produce. Nothing. Back in 1932 if you wanted to make a film, you better be sure to have a story or the studios will not even let you submit another story or even sweep the floors. What we have with Morgan is Mr. Ridley Scott, who hit a payload with the garbage film Alien, yes I said it. Alien is garbage. I am not fooled by nostalgia, or props, and I am not a part of cult. I don't believe in witches or extraterrestrials. Alien is an amateur film with crappy dialogue, characters, plot, scenes, cinematography. The acting is garbage all around. The best part of Alien is the props, and that's not even great. Frankenstein beats Alien on all fronts. Take a look at the prop in Frankenstein, in the form of Boris Karloff and tell me the prop alien in Alien is better. I don't think so. Scott got luck with Alien. Although Blade Runner is a much better movie, he got luck with that as well. At least Blade Runner had a story, and much superior actors. Please read my review of Alien for full evaluation of the garbage that it is.Until film makers start with GREAT and ORIGINAL Stories they will continue to produce films like this. What did we get with the over-hyped Force Awakens? Garbage, copy paste, superwoman! Force is in the name, but it's in the movie for a few seconds. Rogue One we get another superwoman in the middle of a bunch of tough warrior guys and she says, wait for it ""THE TIME TO FIGHT IS NOW!"" No S***!, why do you think we're all here assembled with all the artillery on our backs? It all starts with the writers.As Tiny Tim famously stated, God Help Us, Everyone!"

It stars Kate Mara as Lee Weathers, a ""corporate consultant,"" Anya Taylor-Joy as Morgan, and Rose Leslie as a behavior specialist. Paul Giamatti makes a notable appearance as the only character with emotional depth. Going into the film, I thought it was going to explore the ethical issue of genetic manipulation and cybernetic enhancement. I thought it would pose an interesting dilemma to the audience about whether research of this nature should be pursued, like Ex Machina (2015) did for artificial intelligence. Boy, was I disappointed.First, the film was deceptively marketed. It's not a mystery and it barely passes for horror. Its IMDb summery is, ""A corporate risk-management consultant must decide whether or not to terminate an artificially created humanoid being,"" but that's not actually the plot. Spoiler alert: the end of the film reveals that the corporate consultant was actually a genetically-enhanced assassin, and the whole exercise was an excuse to see whether her version could defeat the newer version, Morgan. So, in the end, there's never a question about whether Morgan should be terminated, and the protagonist never solves a mystery–she knew what Morgan was the whole time. The result was a boilerplate chase/assassin thriller.In one of the best scenes, Paul Giamatti's character, Dr. Alan Shapiro, attempts to evaluate Morgan's emotional development and ends up inciting her to violence, kicking off the second half of the film. In the context of the first half of the film, this scene makes no sense. Morgan had already demonstrated a propensity for violence. Why did Dr. Shapiro insist on entering the room with her? Why did he provoke her when he knew she was likely to assault him? Also, when they first met she demonstrated the ability to read his mind–why did he still believe he could manipulate her? It only makes sense as a plot device to set up a battle between Morgan and Lee Weathers.Of course, this raises a huge question. If Morgan was a genetically engineered assassin, why was the corporation and her project supervisor, Dr. Lui Cheng, so concerned when she exhibited violent behavior? Why did they consider more emotional assassins to be worthy of development in the first place? Lee Weathers' cold, impersonal demeanor didn't seem to inhibit her in any way. She still accomplished her mission. If you were a multinational corporation spending billions of dollars on genetic research, would investing all those resources into making a more emotional assassin make any sense? And, would it make sense to terminate her at the first sign your research had succeeded? There were little things that bothered me too. In one scene, Lee Weathers was locked in Morgan's enclosure and escaped by climbing up a shaft and breaking out the skylight. Why couldn't Morgan have figured that out and made a similar escape? Later, she is shown effortlessly driving and executing maneuvers in a high speed chase and besting Lee Weathers in hand to hand combat. Where did she learn these skills? If the research team was kept in the dark about her ultimate purpose, I doubt they were teaching her martial arts on the side. I also find it hard to believe Morgan could quickly pick up these skills, but then not be able to figure out how to escape through the skylight.Morgan was a promising concept with a decent cast. I actually like the actors and actresses in this movie, especially Kate Mara and Rose Leslie. It's almost worth seeing just for Paul Giamatti's performance. The movie as a whole, however, was poorly executed. The entire assassin angle seemed contrived and unbelievable.If Morgan was actually as advertised–a dilemma over the fate of a genetically enhanced child who displays violent tendencies–it would have been an interesting film. Instead, that plot is undermined by boring car chases and a prolonged duel between two sociopathic, superhuman characters. Finally, the revelation at the end made everything that came before it completely meaningless. It's unfortunate the writers took it in that direction."

" GMO goes psycho
",0.0,0.9064,2017-08-26 00:00:00,3,"First feature film by Luke Scott (son of Ridley Scott), addresses a theme already explored by his father (and way better). Morgan is an artificially-created girl who, at the age of five, is already as physically developed as a teenager and with intelligence well above average. The movie attempts to exploit the conflict between her super-intelligence and her emotional control, but falls flat, because we easily realize that this premise quickly gives way to yet another movie about an ""uncontrollable killer machine"".Held at a facility in the middle of nowhere far from civilization, Morgan is monitored by the group of scientists who created her, but during one of the sessions she becomes violent and attacks one of her handlers. So, a corporate risk-management consultant arrives with a psychologist who conducts an unreliable interview: he first says he wants to conduct a face-to-face interview with Morgan and not through a glass, in order to establish a trustworthy relationship with the patient, but during that same interview he does everything to antagonize Morgan... So, what was made of the trust and professionalism expected of such a reputed psychologist? It is clear that the thing goes sour and he finishes dead.Being more than proved that Morgan does not control her murderous impulses and has to be exterminated (and even given an executive order to that end), they restrain her, but the ""brilliant"" scientists make the stupid decision to not exterminate her anymore, but instead to take her to another location to continue their work. Now, I accept that scientists may develop an emotional connection with their projects, but I do not accept that they are so stupid to the point of not realizing that said project will not hesitate to kill each one of them, and throughout the film all these scientists had ample opportunities to do so but never do it, and this is totally unrealistic: do they not have any basic survival instinct?!? It is then that finally the business consultant comes into play that predictably (although this is only revealed at the end of the movie) is another genetically modified creature that was sent to evaluate and if necessary exterminate Morgan, and from here on out the rest of the film is a game of cat vs mouse without anything special or deep about the theme of the premise. Disappointing. I give it 3/10 because the performances have much merit, but unfortunately, however good that they may be, they can never save a bad script."

Camera - great outdoor scenery, interesting design of their ""remote facility"", dark interiors of the house and hi-tech dungeon. 4. Script - total crap, revealing main tinsel town problem these days - they ran out of ideas. Where are they getting total morons writing them scripts - is beyond my recognition. Even the ending which reveals that Lee Weathers is also artificially created, is not adding anything to the plot as it is quite obvious from the very beginning. Conclusion - the only good thing is: I watched in while working out on elliptic, so it kept my eyes busy for a while otherwise I'd never bother. Definitely isn't worth buying. Those copyright owners should promote that kind of movies for free on every torrent site at least some people will probably bother to watch it."
" The story structure is a real mess
",-0.3612,0.6716,2017-08-18 00:00:00,5,"Here's the problem with 'Morgan' as a film, there are two very distinct halves to the film and yet neither of them really works. The film starts off very slowly, the first 30 minutes are an absolute grind and an arduous one as that. In fact I can imagine a lot of people giving up on the film in the early stages because they thought they were in for some action and weren't getting it. At this stage I thought the film's sole purpose was to be a thought-provoking piece. Then the film takes a very abrupt turn around the halfway point and suddenly becomes a non-stop, violence-filled rampage.So let's take a look at why neither half works. The first half doesn't work for multiple reasons. One, it's been done before. The concept of Artificial Intelligence in films has been explored often and almost always the film makers like to ask the question about whether or not they should be treated as real people with the same rights and privileges. Secondly, the pacing is simply far too slow. I understand they were saving up for the second half, but the problem with that is that by that stage the audience likely no longer cares - if they haven't left the cinema already that is.So the why doesn't the second half work? Firstly, it makes no sense. We have to believe that a group of very intelligent people make some incredibly dumb decisions. From the moment Paul Giamatti's character enters the film (although his acting is admittedly terrific) all sense of logic and believability fly completely out the door. Secondly, the concept of non-stop violence isn't really enough any more. There has to be some intelligence behind it. As it turns out with the twist near the end there actually was a level of intelligence behind it all. The problem is that again the audience didn't know that fact as they were seeing it happen.There are some entertaining moments in the mix and the acting from almost the whole cast is of a pretty high standard. The twist is also clever enough and adds some brownie points. But all added together there's a lot more wrong with this film than there is right."
" MORGAN was a great film with many outstanding actors to carry out difficult roles.
",0.765,0.022,2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"PROS: This movie had a lot going for it. To start off, there were many iconic horror actors like, Anya Taylor-Joy from SPLIT, Rose Leslie from HONEYMOON, and Toby Jones from WAYWARD PINES. The acting in MORGAN was ridiculously good as well. The actors were tasked with such a challenge, they had to really develop their characters to show the bonds that the workers in the facility would have created. A benefit from this was how believable every action was from the characters. There was little to no places in the film that could've been added or subtracted, every scene had a purpose and was done impressively. And to top it all off, the end of the movie was also well crafted. It left the viewer wondering and speculating about the film as a whole, which there again brings you back to how well all the characters were established throughout MORGAN.CONS: There was one con that I felt hurt the movie greatly. The rising action in the film was lost, it felt like it had dragged on, which is unfortunate to say the least. I felt that it fell victim to poor sound effects. I really wished that the sounds in the movie had more tension to them, in this way it could make the scenes more high strung and it would have had a greater purpose.www.chorror.com"
" Be grateful the writers can't create robots
",0.2928,-0.8519,2017-08-02 00:00:00,3,"This is a thriller and horror story with a science fiction flavor totally lacking in scientific value.The world will be a dangerous place if the writers were to try to design robots such as Morgan. Fortunately they would be incapable of it. A robot such as a self-driving car must obey rules. In the case of self-driving cars, the rules are the same as for humans that drive cars. This story ignores many of the fundamental concepts that real AI designers would be familiar with and consider critical. Even up to the very end, the scientist's techniques are totally inconsistent with the reality that real robot scientists would do.Have you heard the story of Microsoft using Twitter to teach their AI chatbot (called ""Tay"")? The result of that was that Tay quickly (within a day) learned to swear and behave in other immature ways. It is a true story. The point is that it was not the programming that was the problem, it was just how the program was taught.This movie treats Morgan the robot as a complete, inseparable whole whereas in fact man-made intelligence would be a combination of many pieces (technologies) and success or failure of one would not necessarily mean the other would succeed or fail."
" Only one mention of the source for this story?
",0.0,0.9393,2017-07-28 00:00:00,5,"Why is there only one mention, in the first three pages of these MORGAN reviews, of Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN, the obvious source for this retelling of her classic story? Are these reviewers all so ingenuous that they are completely ignorant of the original story, or of the earlier films based on the story; all they can allude to are other recent films with similar story lines. This story has an old, old pedigree.MORGAN is just another take on Frankenstein's monster, without any of the substance or density of Mary Shelley, but with some well-paced direction and engaging performances, if cold is your dish. That Lee was an android of some sort was clear all too soon - Scott must have not given Mara any wriggle-room at all. When Morgan flies off her leash, the plot's derivation becomes obvious and we pass the rest of the film vainly waiting for intelligent parallels. The music was effective."

Yes, it is heavy-handed, and minus a few developments, but overall the movie is worth watching. Kudos to the director for making females look as vicious as males. Also some decent setting-projectiles & story through-lines are apparent despite oversights such as the kitchen or the majority of the enormous house, which is left unexplored an perfunctory. What lacks most is character development for the supporting cast (Jennifer Jason Leigh is wasted, plus Paul Giamatti is under-utilized, especially when his character is murdered and then nothing is said or cleaned up despite his busy schedule!) Also be wary of noticeable plot- holes, such as a lack of reinforcements for Kate Mara's character. Most ultra-violent action scenes do deliver if you like that sort of thing. As compared to ""Ex Machina,"" it's about equal in terms of acting and premise. This film could've easily been a full 2 hours long and avoided its low rating by expounding on abbreviated scenes. Predictable by the end, most viewers will anyway enjoy the ride."

How was she able to escape the locked room so easily, but Morgan didn't think of doing the same thing? The way that Mara's character got the upper hand on Morgan was laughable. The reveal at the end was very predictable early on.Toby Jones' character was annoying just to look at. I don't know why. Maybe that was intentional.Michelle Yeoh's character could have been played by nearly anyone with the same impact. There was definitely wasted talent with this casting.Jennifer Jason Leigh's character was nearly worthless. You didn't really find out why she was attacked early on. Then, her character didn't have anything to do for the rest of the movie.Paul Giamatti's character annoyed me the most. He smugly says something like, ""I know what I'm doing!"" and then proceeds to display the fact that his character was completely inept. I think Lucy, from the Peanuts cartoons, would have made a better psychologist/psychiatrist.Rose Leslie's character seemed to be the most interesting character of them all.....and that's saying a lot.Anya Taylor-Joy's character of Morgan didn't make sense.

And yet, we are the childish ones.Well, Mr. BB, let me give you and others a hint of what makes a good movie. A good story makes for interest. Morgan fails at this as we see no redeeming values in her character. When she is on the table and about to be euthanized there is no wanting to see her get up or fight back. I found myself wanting Kate Mara's character to end her in their fight scenes. Even the doctors who 'raised' Morgan have no empathy for her victims. They don't seem to see how dangerous she is even when she mauls her first victim.Only until she rips the throat out of the second doctor do they realize that she might not be stable. Really? It took two victims and a deer before they realized this? And what's with the hoodie?

I find Kate Mara a very adaptable and excellent actor. She's basically good at every role I've ever seen her in regardless of whether she in a supporting role or lead.While I was able to figure out pretty much from the beginning how the plot would go, this was by no means a detraction from seeing how the plot played out.

Most of the movie though occurs with Morgan appearing in her teen years.Morgan feels both good and bad emotions, with her negative emotions affecting her in a dangerous way. In fact she had just assaulted one of her caregivers because she was kept from going outside, which she loved. Due to those circumstances, the corporation sends in a risk management specialist to interview all employees there at the facility as well as Morgan. The specialist lacks emotion and is pretty straight forward; and calls Morgan an ""it"" instead of a ""her"".The movie had an interesting concept which was similarly done in another movie I watched a couple of years back. I'm giving this 6 stars due to a few things. I felt the acting was done well for the most part and the plot was good. The movie did leave out a lot of details and the character of Morgan doesn't grow much on the audience. More time should have been spent developing Morgan's personality...let the audience feel more what she feels. I think more time should have been given to detail more how the process of developing Morgan came about.I recommend watching this movie....some may love it, others may feel as I do about it.

At one point she even says, ""Let me do my job!"", and then proceeds to do it very badly indeed. Hunting in a forest with hundreds of hiding places and a scoped rifle, she stands behind a tree and is immediately spotted by her prey.Not sure why Michelle Yeoh turned up, the script seemed to want a mother figure for Morgan and Toby Jones (wasted) was not it. I think she gets about five lines of dialogue, but several paragraphs of exposition.Everyone else is a bit pathetic; the story tries to set up the family vibe that Morgan was brought up into, but there are too many characters to give them all an adequate back-story and it ends up being confused.The one light is Ana Taylor-Joy as Morgan. Her otherworldly beauty fits the part well, her expressive face conveys every emotion and she sells the role perfectly.The direction is quite flat, there are no surprises in shot composition (apart from a weird SteadyCam shot in the forest, which wasn't quite sure where it was pointing). From not enough cuts in the slow sections, there are too many in the fight scenes; longer takes would make them feel more brutal and real.And why does this film have so many famous people playing minor roles: Brian Cox, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Toby Jones, Michelle Yeoh, Paul Giamatti(brief appearance, but effective)? Did the director call in a huge bunch of favours? Give unknowns a chance, might have been cheaper too.""Ex Machina"" shows what you can do in a closed environment, but this just feels like a wasted opportunity, with many plot-holes. If she is being bred as a weapon, who is giving her the training she will need; her ""family"" is far too insipid for that. If she has telepathic skills and can mind-read names and biographical details, that would help her massively in a fight, but she doesn't use them.The ending is nice and tidy, but would have benefited from being more obtuse and less pat.Ultimately this film doesn't know what it wants to be, horror or SF, and ends up being neither, which is a shame."

That ties into the twist/reveal. By the end, the reveal is not shocking as much as it's perfunctory. After a couple of fights with Morgan, one could guess at the reveal.

The way also in which we are introduced to Morgan (an artificially created being) and the team tasked with handling her development also leaves much to be desired despite some solid attempts by the recognisable cast.Led by Kate Mara as emotionally void higher up employee Lee Weathers, Morgan also introduces us to Rose Leslie's loving carer Dr. Amy Menser and Anya Taylor-Joy's titular mysterious creation but unlike say Ex_Machina's wholly engaging cast of characters and scenes together, Morgan never bothers to make us care about the group were joined up with, even if at times Scott try's to manipulate our emotions in certain ways.It's arguable that there's a good story to be told within Morgan but there's also solid arguments to be made that this type of story has been told before and told a lot better and while it's great to know the Scott name is entering into its next generation, Luke certainly has a long way to go before we can start getting excited about that fact.1 injured deer out of 5"

Picture reading the last chapter of a book first, and then imagine how exciting reading the preceding ones would be.Worth a look, but only if you have some time to kill."

Let's say I was positively surprised at what direction this went. And I really liked the ending, which is always a make or break deal.Science Fiction low budget movies that are actually good are not that common, therefor it's a joy to see something like that being done. I also like the fact that there is a lot of female talent at hand. Which goes to show you that there are a lot of women out there who can pull their own weight, if given the chance.

Having similarities to ""Splice"" and, to an extent, ""Lucy,"" Morgan is (more or less) a test tube baby without a father or mother. She is literally made in the laboratory.However, as in most movies of this genre, things go awry and a corporate assessor is sent to determine whether or not Morgan is worth saving, or if everything needs to be shelved. I believe her decision should have been an easy one given Morgan's outbursts of aggression.There are many named actors in this movie: the divine Rose Leslie (of ""Game of Thrones"" fame), Paul Giamatti, Michelle Yeoh, Toby Jones, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Kate Mara, yet the movie comes across as robotic as its main character. All of the characters are as stiff as cardboard, and if you'll pay close attention, you should be able to figure where all this is headed long before the end credits.Rated ""R"" for violence and language.

So here's another ""Submitted for Your Approval"".Comparisons to the Multitude of Previous Pics are Inevitable, Predictable, and frankly the Attacks on this and others of its Type are as Worn Out as the Formula. This Film Feels Short. Not only the Running Time but the Concept, Characters, and Execution. To Call it Compact would be Accurate. Not much Time is spent on Philosophy, Ethics, or Philip K.

It's Deadly Serious, Dour, and Oh-So Empty Headed where Nobody Dares Smile or Say Anything Intelligent for that matter.But the Action is Rough and Tumble and the Violence is Sharp.

Anna-Taylor Joy as ""Morgan"" is also an Attractive, albeit Creepy Presence.

When she attacks Dr. Shapiro (Paul Giamatti) there is talk of terminating her.Morgan had also previously attacked other workers. it is decided Morgan is too unstable and must be terminated. But since this is too early in the movie to terminate Morgan, she escapes with the friend she trusts, Amy (Rose Leslie). Lee Weathers (Kate Mara) the company's Risk Management Consultant witnesses Morgan's behavior, but the way things happened so fast she does not get a chance to really talk to Morgan. They do talk later when Lee is behind the secured glass wall and cannot get to and subdue Morgan, but Morgan's mind is made up and her plan is to escape because she doesn't want to be terminated. The rest of the movie is Lee chasing Morgan in the woods.Notables: Toby Jones as Dr. Ziegler, a doctor caring for and monitoring Morgan; Jennifer Jason Leigh as Kathy one of the workers Morgan attacked. The acting all around is very good. The fight scenes are cringe- worthy as they are brutal.Is there a twist, you ask? Of course.

" Solid But Unsurprising Saga About Artificial Intelligence
",0.6652,0.6592,2017-03-23 00:00:00,5,"You've seen it done before, and you've seen it better, but freshman director Luke Scott's ""Morgan"" isn't awful. Mind you, it lacks the intelligence of ""Ex Machina""; it lacks the adventure of ""Hanna""; it isn't as outlandish as ""Splice,"" and it isn't the trend-setting spectacle that was ""Blade Runner."" Ridley Scott's son Luke has staged a solid but rarely surprising sci-fi thriller that benefits from sturdy production designs, persuasive performances from a crackerjack cast, and first-rate cinematography with beautiful scenery. The biggest problem with ""Morgan"" is ""Peepers"" scenarist Seth Owens' screenplay never pushes the envelope with its ""Frankenstein"" premise. Thoroughly underwhelming throughout, this flawlessly lensed potboiler with its surprise ending that doesn't amount to much of a disclosure will hold your attention during its meager 92 minutes, but you won't emerge from the experience saying ""Wow!"" Sadly, if you never saw ""Morgan,"" you wouldn't be missing anything. Owens' script concerns the obscure corporation named SynSect and the investigation that it has launches about a hybrid biological organism with the capacity for autonomous decision-making and sophisticated emotional responses genetically modified clone under development which has malfunctioned (think Michael Crichton's ""Westworld"") and it dispatches a risk management consultant, Lee Weathers (Kate Mara of ""The Fantastic Four""), to assess the damage. Basically, this low-budget, science fiction outing doesn't shower us with a lot of special effects, aside from standard-issue banks of monitors and computers in a striking but remote architectural setting. The eponymous character Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy of ""The Witch"") is never shown like Alicia Vikander in ""Ex Machina"" as a stripped down, half-robotic chassis. She wears a hoodie, and she doesn't emphasize her femininity. Neither is she as advanced as the androids in ""Ex Machina."" Comparatively, ""Morgan"" shares more in common with ""Hanna,"" except ""Hanna"" wasn't confined to a claustrophobic setting, and Hanna embarked on a journey of initiation. Like ""Hanna,"" virtually everybody connected with Morgan died a hideous death. Everything in ""Morgan"" occurs in and around the clandestine facility where the scientists conjured up the character, apart from a post-script scene in an urban locale where corporate approves the action taken by Weathers and washes their hands of any remorse.""Morgan"" breaks down neatly into a three-act structure. Lee Weathers cruises off the beaten path to a research and development facility where she meets the scientists who have devoted their genius to creating Morgan, now a five-year old in the body of a teenager, and investigates an accident where Morgan smashed up a scientist's eye. Scott and Owen provide us with flashback footage of Morgan as a tyke and we soak in the family atmosphere of the place that emanates from the collaborative feelings of the scientists. They are strongly protective of Morgan and they remain suspicious of Lee Weathers who poses a threat to their research. The last thing that these scientists worry about is having their cyborg destroyed and their research wasted. In a sense, the ending with its revelation about Lee Weathers seems like a neatly wrapped package. It strikes me that the corporation, if it were greedy, would have taken Morgan elsewhere and reassigned the scientists to other projects. Instead, the corporation destroys the robot that it created and then kills everybody associated with it so nothing about the project will ever see the light of day. Nothing in the aftermath of ""Morgan"" offers either us or the filmmakers with somewhere to go. The success of Lee Weathers isn't that interesting and the destruction of Morgan isn't as satisfying as it should have been. The murder of the family of scientists by either Morgan or Lee Weathers adds nothing except to seal everything into a nice, neat package that a sequel will never unwrap and analyze. The fate of ""Morgan"" is that it sticks to the formula but it never transforms the formula. Luke Scott is not without talent. By the third act of ""Morgan,"" Scott has changed his approach as the story intensifies. Restrained at the outset as everybody broods and Morgan makes her apologizes, ""Morgan"" concludes with an action-packed finale that Scott indulges in with a conspicuous lack of restraint, in other words, the camera-work is more active than passive than it was at the start. Again, the performances are all memorable. You feel more sympathetic toward the dedicated scientists who struggle to nurture Morgan but have been unable to discipline her than either the anonymity of Lee Weathers or the remorseful behavior of Morgan."

Very few movies one views, especially movie buffs, can honestly say that they don't see similarities or something that reminds them of another movie. I for one often am looking for a movie that fits a certain criteria. With that you will get the similarities. Plus this was a smart movie meaning not just some action sci-fi for a dumbed down audience. There was some intellect put into this film. The acting in this movie was A-Grade and many familiar faces playing supporting roles. The story successfully blended sci-fi (yes, along the lines of Ex-Machina, Westworld, and even Terminator), with psychological horror (think Legend of Hell House and The Other Ones). Not saying all will but I did predict the ending early on but I'm thinking the makers of this film wanted people to have that thought as a possibility (no spoiler given). The violence, while I wouldn't call it gory, was realistic and very well placed throughout the movie."
" An average thriller
",0.1027,0.8715,2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,Morgan was an average sci-fi thriller with decent acting by the cast especially Anya Taylor Joy. The story is similar to Ex-Machina by inferior to that film. The pacing was slow in most parts of the film and it was predictable but the acting elevated the film for the most part. It is good for a one time watch if you are into the science fiction genre involving the humanity of artificial intelligence.
" Waste of a good idea

You could guess every single turn of the movie and the ending was so obvious. The idea and the psychological side of characters would have got so much more to give, but that all was ruined with the thin plot. Waste of time."
" I kind of feel sorry for scientists...
",-0.0772,0.9114,2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"I mean, in pretty much every movie, they are portrayed as either idiots, romantic fools without clinical detachment, or just plain megalomaniacs. It would be nice if a movie about ""science gone wrong"" actually had the scientists be scientists, rather than bumbling buffoons meddling with things they do not understand.Well, sadly, Morgan is not that movie. The scientists here all get overly attached to their work, leading to predictable mayhem and destruction.Overall, Morgan is not a bad film. Dumb scientists apart, it is a reasonable thriller that, although utterly predictable, entertains for the most part.Whilst we all crave a movie that surprises us and makes us mutter ""Didn't see that coming!"", it is sometimes nice to watch a movie and know what is to come well in advance of the characters in the story.Morgan is that latter type of film. Even the ""twist"" at the end is utterly predictable and, if I'm honest, rather ham-fistedly telegraphed at points earlier on in the movie. That doesn't mean the film is bad, except in its lack of originality. It is just rather formulaic.The cast do their best. I doubt any of them were challenged by their ""overly attached ex-girlfriend"" characterisations and the movie builds quite nicely over its run time. A couple of the cast, like Jennifer Jason Leigh and Brian Cox, are woefully under-utilised and only Paul Giamatti really gets to go nuts in his brief cameo.Overall, I found it more engaging than Ex-Machina, which it is often compared to, and less preachy. What it does well, is make you change your opinion of the main character, Morgan herself, several times during the film. You feel by turns, pity, then fear, of the character and this cycle happens more than once.However, overall, it isn't anything special or worth going out of your way for and finds its best moments in the first half of the film.SUMMARY: Rejoice as dumb scientists return! Science bad, violence good. Science will kill us all etc etc. Woefully obvious twist ending. Okay, but nothing you'll discuss around the water-cooler the following day."
" More a great TV pilot than a feature film
",0.659,0.83,2017-02-17 00:00:00,6,"My rating would have been higher but for the fact the film lacked the visual surprise and narrative depth the idea required. But it remains an enjoyable, tense drama about the challenges of AI. The principals, Kate Mara and Anya Taylor-Joy are strong but some of the minor characters are poorly scripted and not wholly convincing, particularly a miscast Toby Jones with an unnecessarily poor accent. The number of players, too, would have been more fitting of a TV pilot for a running series rather than a single set piece that might well have been a stage-play, with a stronger script."
" Under the radar
",0.0,0.9476,2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"This movie may have been one of the bigger surprises of 2016 for me. But, hardly any publicity, no real big-name actors, and a release on a summer holiday equaled an 18th place debut at the box office. Yes you read that correctly. It only barely made its $8 million budget back, and it took the international haul to tip it over the edge. Paul Giamatti was great in his small part and Anya Taylor-Joy impressed. In reality, the whole cast, side characters included, were very solid. There were a few moments of unnecessary exposition, but nothing overt. It has a dark tone and keeps the pressure up throughout. If you're looking for a unique, under the radar sci-fi flick, Morgan's got you covered."
" Adequate thriller, but far from original
",0.5574,0.9946,2017-02-06 00:00:00,6,"Given the existence of two other moderately comparable films with titles consisting of a female first name (i.e. ""Lucy"" and ""Hanna"" - both of which I've reviewed), there seems little doubt what niche ""Morgan"" is aiming at. That begs a question as to whether this British-American piece from Ridley Scott's son Luke Scott is not afraid of the competition because it's confident of its own quality and merits, or whether it's simply too ignorant to care. Those are two quite different possibilities and in fact it's a fairly close call between them! Ultimately, I QUITE enjoyed ""Morgan"" (which is also a bit similar to ""Ex Machina""), but would have enjoyed it a great deal more had it cost me less to see it (yes, I'm afraid it's that kind of trade-off). There is some OK acting here, especially from Anya Taylor-Joy in the title role (when she is not ""in action"" at least), from Kate Mara as the person pitted against her, and - as ever - from Paul Giamatti. Michelle Yeoh has great screen presence without trying too hard, though Rose Leslie (of ""Downton Abbey"" and ""Game of Thrones"" fame) takes no step forward of any kind here.I'm not normally cagey about giving away plot details, as I know a good film can stand that - hence the ever-present spoiler warning. But here it would be pointless to write much, as it would CERTAINLY ruin the film. This is therefore its own kind of warning about this piece being a bit content-free (and it also includes the occasional dialogue clanger like ""biological organism"" - though this is nowhere near as bad as in ""Lucy"", by the way). However, ""Morgan"" is reasonably atmospheric, reasonably well-located, and it does - at moments - achieve the intended mix of emotions that (if taken further and handled with a lighter touch) would have raised ""Morgan"" up several notches. For brief periods, our heroine (if such be Morgan herself) engenders tender feelings - not least sympathy for her predicament - from the viewer, but these periods are somewhat too brief, and the story overall slightly too predictable, to allow those feelings to flower as they otherwise might. 50% less ""action"" and 50% more of the aforementioned sensitivity, and we really might have been on to something, but as ever it's a question of pleasing different audiences. Personally speaking, I could have been more pleased than I was, but do not regard ""Morgan"" as entirely a waste of time. And - overall - it's probably not much worse than ""Hanna"", so take your pick..."
" Better than Ex Machina and Splice
",0.4404,0.9528,2017-02-01 00:00:00,9,"Going into this I was very much convinced it would be a copy of Ex Machina or Splice, neither of which I thought was spectacular, just OK. However, I think I preferred this over either of the aforementioned movies.It is closer in plot and ideas to Splice, but does have some traits from Ex Machina but only in that it addresses the moral dilemma of where ""human"" begins or is defined. Morgan went beyond the two previous movies in that it was looking at multiple people's view of the subject instead of just two persons views like Ex Machina. It shows a dynamic of a team of individuals and how they view Morgan as opposed to how ""The Company"" views it.Where this movie kicks into overdrive is the last 20 minutes. The truth about the company rep, Kate Mara, comes to life as well as the truth about Morgan. All and all, this is better than Ex Machina, which was good but bordered on boring, and Splice which was too stiff and poorly executed as a whole. Reviewers are saying it is a take off of those, which it is, but it succeeds where those two failed. Also, on a personal note, those folks comparing it to the movies that came before it, are the same ones that will tell you all remakes stink, instead of looking at a film as its own piece of work and NOT comparing it to others."
" This may be like Ex-Machina...but its not.
",0.3612,0.9252,2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"What people miss in this movie, they miss by comparing it to other AI contemporaries. It has everything to do with the subject, but has its own merit...to the end. Yes some concessions have to be made (don't they always), but none too hard for me. For instance, character development. Little existed because little was needed. Each character was either a known actor (needing less introduction) or stereotypically unique to the cast; letting them stand alone and be quickly evaluated.This does have the ecosystem qualities, female leads, and similar allure as Ex-Machina, but it's distinctly different. As many more of these films continue to surface in the coming months and years, we all will continue to grapple with the ethics and potential consequences. But rather than pure science, this version deals with the dynamics of science, research teams, human weaknesses in the process, as well as competitive forces of people, corporations, and government (in terms of weaponization).This movie is succinct, smart, and definitely worth the watch."

Either an attempt is made to create a properly functioning living being, by making use of human remains, such as in ""Frankenstein"". In most cases a high-tech design containing artificial intelligence is made, as in ""Ex Machina"" or ""Uncanny"". In ""Closer to God"", the cloning of a human being is the central subject. Or as in ""Splice"", you'll see the manipulation of DNA from different organisms which leads to a reasonable bizarre looking being. Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy) is the result of synthetic DNA and applying nanotechnology on the neural network of an organism. It's a rapidly developing human-like creature, whose intelligence and physical appearance grows exponentially. As Dr. Ziegler (Toby Jones) enthusiastically said : ""A hybrid biological organism with the capacity for autonomous decision-making and sophisticated emotional responses"".But as always, deficiencies can be found in this seemingly perfect creation. As in all the above-mentioned similar stories, those who carried out the task of creator of human life (in religious circles the expression divine intervention would be used rapidly), will become victims of their own creation. That's something Dr. Grieff Kathy (Jennifer Jason ""The hateful Eight"" Leigh) experienced first-hand. A talk session with Morgan, who flew into an abusive rage, ends with a pierced eye. But like all other scientists who try to create artificial life, an emotional bond is being formed between the creator and the creature which leads to a rather protective attitude from the scientists. We see the same here as Lee Weathers (Kate Mara) is summoned to assess the situation and to take the decision whether or not to proceed with the Morgan project. This could mean the termination of Morgan's existence.The film was directed by Luke Scott, son of my ""all time favorite"" director Ridley Scott. Unmistakable he inherited the qualities as a director from his father. Even though the story isn't exactly groundbreaking, Luke Scott manages to create some suspense. Of course, the acting of Anya Taylor Joy and Kate Mara also played an important role. Morgan is kind of creepy, despite her human appearance, with her pale white face and jet-black piercing eyes. The same look as in ""The VVitch"". But it is mainly her attitude and composure that impresses. A shrewd and thought out look. And yet, Morgan can transform any moment into a raging fury, harboring a deadly aggression. Lee Weathers has that same calmness and sobriety with which she approaches the facts. Two equal personalities ending up in a fierce confrontation.The given situation with Morgan behind armored glass, was a perfect opportunity to increase the tension between Morgan, Lee Weathers and those who created her. Immediately it made me think of ""The Silence of the Lambs"". The only thing that annoyed me the most, was the intervention of Dr. Alan Shapiro (Paul Giamatti). An unstable, artificial experiment attacks a staff-member in an aggressive manner, yet this tactless, blasé behaving psychiatrist can interview it without any protection. When this ignoramus starts to provoke Morgan in a challenging way, the outcome is really predictable. What else did this charlatan expect to happen? A miraculous personality change? Although this scene conveys an overall stupidity, it's a very intense moment. It's, as it were, a tilting moment in the film. Giamatti plays his part in a brilliant way. This actor knows how to pick his roles. Mostly it isn't a decisive leading part, but each character Giamatti chooses, plays a crucial role in the course of the film. The chauffeur Ralph in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is another example.But despite the strong performances and intriguing subject, this felt like a mediocre film to me. Probably because I could guess already in advance which way it was going. Even the crazy, violent denouement with a rampaging frenzy Morgan in the lead, couldn't change the ordinary feeling of mediocrity. A kind of ""light"" version of ""Ex Machina"". Everything that made the latter so overwhelming, was missing here. More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

" A very good movie!
",0.54,-0.079,2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie is in line with The Machine, Ex-Machina, and Humans (TV series). Similar to those three, it has a certain subdued ''British'' feel to it without it being an actual British movie, and not quite being on the same level. However, it is - in my opinion - an extremely good movie in spite of what some reviewers mentioned. First of all, the ''electronic'' music is sparse, and only adds to the coldness and spookiness of certain moods when it is there. One reviewer raised a list of questions that were apparently unanswered in the movie. I answered all of them. I won't list every single one, as this is not a ''reply '' to his post. Suffice it to say that, yes, the movie does explain why one of the people in Morgan's entourage got stabbed in the eye. Kate Mara is excellent in every way, as is Anya Taylor-Joy. The rest of the cast - except for the Chinese doctor perhaps - alas, pale in comparison. Some people criticized the ending. If you ''expect'' a typical Hollywood ending, you'll be disappointed. If, however, you're accustomed to the European, Asian, or Philip K. Dick type of endings, you'll be rewarded. 8/10 for me."

Although it does not entirely succeed, you can watch this one without being bored.The acting is well done besides Kata Mara's performance. This might be subjective view, since I never liked Kata Mara at all. I think she is a very one dimensional actress, but well, that might be just my opinion. In this movie her performance is underwhelming, and also she gives away the ""big twist"" pretty early in the game by the way she acts. I don't wanna lie, I figured it out basically after 5 minutes, and I guess, so will you. This is what did cost ""Morgan"" 3 to 4 stars from the start.It is filmed very well, I liked the cinematography, and I liked the soundtrack. What I did not understand was why so many big names were wasted. Jennifer Jason Leigh was in it, Paul Giamatti was in it, Rose Leslie was there, Michelle Yeoh was in it. And they all get like two minutes of screen time and had no opportunity to shine. Well, Giamatti a bit maybe, if you like overacting a lot.The movie, as other reviewers already stated, is very obviously a try to be ""Ex Machina"", but heavily lacking the smart charm and very good and thought through script of this exceptional movie. Still...I liked the idea of the movie, and I immediately routed for Morgan as a ""person"". So, as probably many of you guys will, I hoped all the time she will ""win"" and overcome the situation, but here we go again, it is no ""Ex Machina"". I hated Kata Mara's character, and the end was...meh. Not because of the idea, but because of the explanations, that you get in the end - they are the direct opposite of what you see on screen and make you questions the basic decisions of the company even more. But go and find out, maybe you will like it.Also important: this is NOT a horror movie. This is an absolutely standard science fiction flick. It had it's flaws but kept me fairly entertained for the entire runtime, so my vote is 5 out of 10."
" Come on let's twist again, Like we did last year......
",0.3612,0.9477,2017-01-20 00:00:00,4,"A movie that hinges it's big ending on a major plot twist that becomes blindingly obvious 15 minutes in has basically set itself up to fail.Maybe as an audience we've seen all manner of plot twists to the extent that we've now become pretty astute at sniffing them out.This twist however requires no sniffing out. The director might as well have lit a glaring neon sign saying ""major plot twist under construction"" right at the start.Aside from that this movie shows that the people responsible for bringing an artificial life form about will be the dumbest people on the planet.In once scene Paul Giamattis character insists that he interviews his subject in the same room across a table rather than from behind a safety glass. The last time this subject sat across someone at a table, she stabbed her victim repeatedly in the eye.Paul Giamatti now not only sits across her, but yells and goads her into giving a physical response as to how she feels. ""Show me"" he yells at her repeatedly.No prizes for guessing what happens next.No prizes for guessing the ending within the first 15-20 minutes of the movie either.The only prize this movie gets from me is a blown raspberry and two thumbs down."
" a good dark sci-fi horror movie
",-0.2023,0.9822,2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"So Morgan directed by Luke Scott is a sci-fi horror movie with the plot involving a team of scientist tried to raise a girl made from a lab that go horribly wrong .Basic concept that has been made million time before but this time it actually tried to tell a different story.Much like his dad Sir Riddley Scott the man who brought us many great sci-fi movie like Blade Runner,Alien and Prometheus he really know how to shoot a movie with great cinematography and beautiful isolation location.The acting in this movie is great,everybody is giving their best work throughout the movie with two spot on performance by Kate Mara and Anya Taylor-Joy play the main character Morgan who keep proving herself is one of the best young actress working day.In the end this is a damn fine sci-fi horror movie with many intense scene,good action movie set pieces and a very shocking third part which make me feel very disturbed.If you a hardcore sci-fi movie fan definitely check this movie out"
" very weak
",-0.4927,-0.8941,2017-01-17 00:00:00,2,"the movie starts pretty boring till minute 36 when a doctor comes to asses the AI thinking, and it ends at 47 minutes when the doctor dies.from that moment the only reaction i received from the movie was annoy, those highly specialized people fail to put in place any safety measure to stop the AI, and they fail again and again and again in those situations it is highly improbable that people will act so childish and accept to be killed and even in that situation they don't act the end is pretty clear from around 47 minute and forward TL DR for 11 minutes of decent and realistic movie (36-47) i consider this movie a waste and not advice you to waste time like i did"
" Surprising ending
",0.2732,0.8033,2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"I am voting for 8 out of 10, not because of the plot, the actors, the idea behind the movie or the dialogues, but because of the ending. Until the very last minute I was neither disappointed nor satisfied with the movie, but when I figured out what Lee Weathers really was, I was stunned. Seconds ago I had considered her unnatural actions (like killing Skip Vronsky) a negative point, and I am a little surprised that I did not see that twist about Lee's nature coming. It makes sense though, and explains many aspects of the movie that might have been debatable until then, for example Dr. Lui Cheng asking Lee whether they met before which Lee denies.I have to admit that I still was utterly surprised discovering the fact that Lee herself (or itself, considering her resistance against assigning a gender to Morgan) was not entirely human. I did not see it coming and it was presented very well. The timing of Lee turning her hands and the dialogue of the executives of the company was excellent.Morgan is not one of the best movies I have seen (not even close), but it managed to surprise me in an unexpected moment."
" Not really worth the pay off
",-0.3708,-0.9946,2017-01-13 00:00:00,1,"So the movie for 99% percent of it is a boring dumb predictable snore fest. The premise and story and payoff is decent, but the reason why you're seeing so many negative reactions is because the scientists, all of them are just incredible stupid and shallow. It's a ton of ""there's a shark in the water lets go swimming!"" scenes. Its not just a couple like Prometheus that ruin an otherwise exciting premise. Its over and over and over again. The worst possible example is a scene that goes on forever of this ""pompous arrogant doctor""(the one note cliché could have been written by a new born) arguing with the doctors that he ""Needs"" to be face to face with Morgan instead of behind glass to properly evaluate if she should be put down post rampage, despite being warned over and over that SHE IS A WEAPON THAT JUST TRIED TO KILL SOMEONE.You know how you're in a theater and you'll hear some moron yell at the screen ""OMG Don't GO IN THERE""?Thatll be you, constantly, every 5 minutes, through the entire movie.Seriously just avoid this one."
" Ironic direction choice?
",-0.128,-0.4654,2017-01-08 00:00:00,3,"Given that this is simply Blade Runner without the budget or the genius, it's ironic that the son of Ridley Scott was chosen to make this mediocre vessel. Or was it ironic? Regardless, feel sorry for Scott Jr. that this is where his wreath has fallen.There are no characters only templates. The actors are never called on to perform anything beyond the barest notes of orchestrated emotion. It's sad given the caliber of talent brought to this project.The saddest moment is the reveal. It would have been far more fitting and interesting had it played to its source by having her open her hands to show an origami figure nestled in her torn palms. Instead her hands are empty. Empty like the moment in the film it hearkens back to. Empty like the lack of philosophical exploration that is never explored here. Empty like the feeling you are left with as this trifle folds into its obvious conclusion."
" Morgan Freewoman
",0.0,0.1705,2017-01-05 00:00:00,3,"Seriously, just watch Ex Machina. It's 10x the movie this is.Actually, there are dozens of movies out there like Morgan. Many better, few worse. So, this is nothing new. Unfortunately, how they tried to ""shake things up"" is with a twist that's foreseen 8 or less minutes into the movie. What's left?Well, an all-star cast of great actors that, sadly, never excelled. Fairly good cinematography, but not explored enough. Interest in what Morgan can do, though never explained and the rules kept changing. Morgan is smart beyond smart without signs of how she acquired such knowledgeand never showing any intelligence in any one scene. Characters we care about with the motivations and actions of abnormal humans. And there are hot, girl-on-girl fight scenes filmed by a blind cameraman. Hey now. It's not my fault every positive I came up with the movie shot down.Morgan tells the now-ancient story of DNA manipulation, rapid growth and corporate greed. Morgan is the third attempt at creating life and after five years, she/it/buddy maims a staff member causing a suit from corporate to investigate the risk of their investment. Enter many subplots that begin, abruptly end or never explored, actions that make you wonder if even the cast were in on the script and tone-shift from sci-fi to sorta action, sorta horror and all predictable territory. After all I said above, I didn't hate on the movie. There were sparks that showed the director/writer had ideas and maybe they can be explored on future projects. Maybe they can learn from these mistakes.But for now, it's an ""eh"" or ""wtf"" film that wants to be much deeper than it appears on the very thin surface.***Final thoughts: The Fly II, Splice, Ex Machina, Alien: Resurrection, Jurassic Park(s) and Frankenstein are just the movies off the top of my head this film mimicked. I am sure there are countless othersif I did research. Not worth it. Just know this isn't the first A.I.D.N.A-gone- bad story."
" Better than expected, especially given reviews?!?
",0.5502,0.9642,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"We were pleasantly surprised by this one. It's a solid sci-fi that keeps a good pace and seems to have known better than to wear out its welcome, as do so many movies these days. The movie is right at an hour and a half and it felt perfect for the pace and story.I'm very surprised by the emphatic negative reviews for this movie. I can see it being a little slow for viewers looking for something more like Independence Day and less like Signs but I wouldn't call it boring by a long shot. On the flip side, I also see many negative comparisons to Ex Machina - while I'd say EM was probably a more sound movie from an overall film-making and quality perspective, I'd watch Morgan a second and third time before I'd want to sit through EM again.It was a good, thoughtful, entertaining movie and it gives me hope that Luke Scott will carry on the Scott tradition of being a cut above in Hollywood."
" Good sci-fi horror thriller
",-0.1027,0.8265,2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"In the intro, via cameras, wee see and hear a woman talk to someone in some room. The other person appears. As the woman explain something about letting the other one out, this one suddenly leaps forward and stabs her repeatedly in the eye.Then we meet Lee, a corporate risk assessment consultant who is sent to the remote facility where this incident took place. She talks to the scientists there who have been living at this camp for years. Lee talks to the victim of the attack who somehow survived, but she's drugged. However, she has quickly gets a sense of who Lee really is, and what she's there to do.Then Lee and we meet Morgan. Morgan is a hybrid human/AI. She's a few years old but looks like a teenager and is also developing superior mental abilities. Basically, the entire team loves her and makes excuses for the attack. In flashbacks we see how Morgan enjoyed walking in the woods and the river. One important event was when she ran into a starving and injured deer and she decided to end its misery.The next day the psychologist arrives who will evaluate Morgan's state of mind. To him she might as well be a microwave, no different than other AI. The doctor pushes Morgan until she flips out and chews his neck off. Now the crew under Lee's supervision as well as the researcher in charge decide to put Morgan to sleep. Of course others have different plans and Morgans escapes and goes again into berserk mode. Of course Lee will have to try and take care of things.Morgan isn't particularly original nor compelling. It's got some weaknesses no doubt, but nevertheless, it worked for me. I seriously ended up disliking Lee and rooting for Morgan, while scratching my head about her nonsensical behavior. There's an interesting revelation about the purpose for creating Morgan and a twist that will eventually dawn on the audience before it's made clear. The strangest thing perhaps is that this movie didn't aim to stand out when it could have."
" What an awesome movie it turns out to be!
",0.6588,0.9032,2017-01-02 00:00:00,10,"Don't get me wrong. I despise Morgan. She's a lab grown 5-year-old freak with a temper problem and strong violence tendency. Besides, she's unattractive. Therefore, I don't feel any sympathy for her.The scientists that bred Morgan were plain silly and unlovable. I didn't feel any sympathy for them either when they were killed by Morgan. They deserved it. I was rooting for Kate Mara's Lee Weathers all the way.I would have felt sympathetic towards Morgan if more backstories had been given to enrich the character and make me care and if Morgan had been prettier. Instead, I just didn't care.Halfway through the movie, I was thinking, yeah, now the priority is to kill Morgan, how predictable.Then came that marvelous fantastic plot twist... My heart was flooded with joy in the end.Yes! Brilliant! Beautiful! Kate Mara is perfect.PS: Kate would make a wonderful Ada Wong. Her Chinese is so good."
