" One of the most underrated movies of all time
",0.0,0.296,2021-02-03 00:00:00,9,This movie is perfect in every way as far as my movie watching is concerned anyways. It may be a little slow but it is so embracing. Key word embracing. I give it a solid 9 seriously.
" Truman - A wonderful lesson in humanity, disconcertingly natural!
",0.7574,0.9852,2020-10-17 00:00:00,10,"Truman is a Hispano-Argentinian movie directed by Cesc Gay released in 2015. This dramatic comedy written by C. Gay and Tomàs Aragay is interpreted by an extraordinary duo of simply brilliant actors: ""Ricardo Darín and Javier Cámara"". Truman is screened in many international festivals (Toronto Festival, San Sebastian festival ...) where it has won several awards; he is also rewarded at Spanish and Argentinian award ceremonies. Crowned with five Goyas, including the prize for best movie and best director, this feature film evokes with tenderness, humor and sobriety the approaching death, Ricardo Darín and Javier Cámara weave a story of friendship and full of tenderness, with its non said and her tears withheld. ""Truman"" is a nugget of emotions and the great strength of this movie is the extraordinary interpretation of the two main actors who will be incredibly natural and sober, nothing in this movie is forced and you can feel very well all the dramatic sensibility of the story, not a draw, but an extraordinary emotion that has never been there to extract the dramatic side of the film for free. A movie that simply deserves to be seen for all its emotions."
" Because I liked Ricardo Darin as an actor I choose this film. However well acted and genuine, it is a bit boring.
",0.3818,0.6849,2020-05-04 00:00:00,6,"Because I liked Ricardo Darin as an actor I choose this film. However well acted and genuine, it is a bit boring.The story: Ricardo Darin is dying of cancer and he meets his long time friend for a last time and he meets a few other people for the last time. And he seeks a new owner for his dog.This movie is not about his dog Truman really. It is basically about dying. It is in no way a bleak movie, on the contrary, talking about dying is done in a lighthearted way..The bad: it's a bit boring. How can a story about dying be boring, well it can, because it is definitely lacking drama and it aint really funny either.The good: Ricardo Darin is always worth watching as an actor. The story is subtle and friendly."
" Short review: What a surprise.

" Entertaining and humorous despite the sad undertone and the underlying cause (uncurable cancer). Strong story and movie populated with strong actors
",0.9281,0.6405,2018-09-11 00:00:00,8,"Entertaining all the time, despite the serious undertone and the sad underlying cause that makes everything happen and keeps the story rolling on. It is the unpopular decision to stop medical treatment and scans, to merely await a certain death without all the burdens of hospitals and other forms of medical interference with inevitable death caused by his progressing cancer. Of course, everyone tries to change his mind but they all are doomed to fail (is this a spoiler?). He, on the other hand, causes several surprises while dealing with family, friends and colleagues, in the sense that his attitude is refreshing, far from depressing as could be expected. The dog named Truman that gave the movie his name, is the subject of several attempts to find a suitable new household for him, involuntarily being another cause to keep the story rolling, if not working as a running gag. Apart from dog Truman unknowingly playing a central role, the two main characters are Julian, who is terminally ill and refuses further treatment, and Thomas, who is sent by his wife to let Julian change his mind. The two were close friends many years ago but pick up their friendship easily as if there had been no interruption. While Julian does not stop surprising Thomas with unexpected moves, they both behave very rationally and succeed very well in coping with pitiful scenes and dealing with people avoiding contact because of not knowing how to behave or what to say.  All in all, a strong story line and a movie populated with strong actors. Luckily, there is no tear jerking and I could not spot any overly emotional scenes. There is ample humor interwoven in the script, and the surprises induced by Julian and his sometimes-unorthodox behavior, keep our attention from start to finish."
" Real picture of grief, patience, and friendship
",-0.0772,0.9988,2017-05-13 00:00:00,9,"*Spoilers* This movie struck me hard. Its pace is like several short stories that bring the beauty of life in small conversations. It's not so very much a comedy, as it is more so a slice of life and drama. The pace does match the motif; this is Julian's walk towards the end of life.The two friends are different people, but they understand each other - it's clear they fill each other's gaps. Tomas has to dive into the grim reality of Julian's coming death. Julian tackles the challenging procedures that accompany death with a level and mature head, much to Tomas' discomfort.However, Tomas quickly understands although Julian is a strong personality and a brave person, he needs help getting through the 'logistics' of dying. He just needs a friend to walk with him to the end. Money is no question for Tomas, and it's interesting they don't speak too much about their personal past or talk about their memories together. But the two actors are so in sync in the present moment you feel like you are a voyeur in a very long and profound friendship.It's also interesting to see the power of what having a true friend can do to your life. With Julian's encounters with the fake friends at the restaurant and the friend he hurt, we see very great slices of life. The power of having a great friend, the cowardice of 'fake' friends, the consequences of betraying a friend, and the accountability of taking ownership.Although Tomas is at first uncomfortable with coordination with Julian through these painful rites of passage of death, he quickly steps up to the plate. When Julian realises how small an urn is, his eye turns glassy, and it is evident he is replaying his entire life. Hi was a stage legend in his life, and now everything of his being will be fit into a small jar. Tomas is fast to recognise this and takes charge of the conversation and asks for the estimates and billing information. He also facilitates Julian's visit to see his son Nico, and challenges Julian to do the right thing, and tell him of the decision to skip chemo.I gave the actor who played Nico a hard time because he seemed so awkward, but when more is revealed about him later, I can understand how a 21 kid could look so uncomfortable. When Julian and Nico hug their last hug, I cried so so so much. I'm tearing up thinking about it even now. This film is such a powerful movie.I wanted to mention; someone felt the sex scene was unnecessary. I felt at first the length of it was a bit overkill, but I understood the power in the point of the scene. Tomas and Paula are both frustrated with Julian, but still, can't find themselves being able to express how they feel as they know it would be unfair to Julian at this point of his life *death*. So to find a release for their frustration in orgasm is a touching scene, albeit a bit too long.Then there's Truman. I have a dog, and this dog made me cry too much during this movie. Julian is broke at the end of his life. His boss fired from his passion for acting; he has no real friends in Madrid other than his cousin. Julian needs to be in control in the end, and he needs to be the one who decides when it's time for his life to end. But he knows he can't do any of this without knowing Truman is in good hands. Geez, at the very end of this movie, I was not expecting what I saw. When Tomas gives Julian the leash and starts talking, I just cried my life away. The actor who plays Tomas does this scene so well, of hearing out Julian, not interrupting him, and just accepting this gift. He understood that although he was able to bring joy to Julian, and hopefully give Julian strength (and money) to live a little bit longer to see his son again, Julian's choice was clear. He took care of every aspect Tomas would need to know, and gave him the best gift he could afford - his dog.It also shows how he proves his love for his friend, he could not speak to him like he wanted to, nor could Tomas spend as much time as he wanted to, he could not express his feelings verbally, but he was present. He was present and able to take action for Julian. And this is such a great testament to what you can do for someone who has lost someone, or is grieving, or is at the end of their journey. Just be there, be present, just acknowledge them, and let them feel empowered to face their life situation.I think this is the best movie I've seen this year. It is slow paced and simple but very touching. I hope everyone could have a friendship like this."
" One of the best movies I've seen in a long time
",0.6369,0.9952,2017-05-06 00:00:00,9,"""Truman"" (2015 release from Spain; 109 min.) brings the story of Tomas and Julian. As the movie opens, we see Tomas, a Spanish emigrant now in Canada, flying over to Madrid. He is there for an unannounced visit to his life-long friend Julian, an Argentinean theater actor living in Spain. It's not long before we learn that Julian has lung cancer and is refusing any further chemo treatment. Is Tomas there to try and change Julian's mind? And what becomes of Truman, Julian's old dog who has seen better days as well? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Spanish writer-director Cesc Gay. Here he brings an intense and emotional (but never sentimental) look at what a man does with his day-to-day life when his remaining time is limited, and how it affects his relationship with a guy who once was (still is?) his best friend but now lives in faraway Canada. It is important to emphasize that this easily could've been an emotional exploitation movie, yet Cesc Gay manages to infuse the perfect dose of reality. Check out the scene where Julian, accompanied by Tomas, goes to the funeral home to make funeral arrangements. ""And who is the deceased?, asks the funeral director. ""Me"", Julian wryly responds. ""Oh..."" Just because the movie purposefully shies away from obvious emotional exploitation, we find ourselves sucked in even deeper. I was simply blown away by it all. Cesc Gay movie regulars Ricardo Darin (as Julian) and Javier Camera (as Tomas) each provide towering acting performances. But ultimately I feel that the credit must go primarily to Cesc Gay for this wonderful movie, easily one of the best I have seen in a long time (and that's saying something as I see a LOT of movies).""Truman"" opened to immediate acclaim at the Toronto International Film Festival 2 years ago, and went on to garner multiple awards. Imagine my surprise when the movie opened without any pre-release advertising or fanfare at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, I went to see it right away. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, not surprising to me (given the lack of any marketing for this film). Regardless, if you are interested in a slice of life that will resonate closer to you that you may think, or simply want to enjoy a top-notch foreign indie movie the likes of which are all too rare, you don't want to miss this. ""Truman"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" a real guy friendship
",0.4404,0.9621,2017-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Greetings again from the darkness. Is this a cancer movie? A dog movie? A buddy movie? Well, the answer is yes – at least somewhat – to all three. Writer/director Cesc Gay and co-writer Tomas Aragay offer up an unusually paced and uniquely focused film that is likely to strike a chord with many viewers, while leaving some others thinking, what's the point? For those of us in that first group, it's an absorbing ride-along with a not overly likable character who is out to put his proverbial ""affairs in order"".Two exceedingly talented actors take the lead here and draw us right in. Ricardo Darin (terrific in The Secret in Their Eyes, 2009) is Julian, and Javier Camera (an Almodovar regular, so shuddersome in Talk to Her) is his long time friend Tomas. Knowing his friend is dying, Tomas hops on a plane back to Madrid, from his new life in Canada, in order to spend four days and yes, to say goodbye.The surprise visit sends the two long-time buds on a kind of (mostly) inner-city ""road trip"". Their daily outings include: a trip to the veterinarian so Julian can prepare his dog Truman (a non-puppy Bullmastiff) for the coming change; a doctor visit to convey the desire to cease treatment on the tumors; a bookstore to search for material on pet psychology; a diner where Julian confronts old friends – a lunch that provides significant insight into Julian's mindset; an in-home visit to a potential pet adoption family; a direct chat proving 'the show must go on' with the owner (Jose Luis Gomez) of the theatre where Julian works as an actor; a spur of the moment flight to Amsterdam for lunch with Julian's estranged son Nico and wife Sophie; and a meet on the street with Julian's ex-wife. In between, there are exchanges with Julian's cousin Paula (a very good Dolores Fonzi) who can't hide her frustration despite offering unwavering support.There are many wonderfully subtle moments that keep the story grounded and prevent anything approaching the typically over-dramatic movie that we have become so accustomed to. Death and comedy don't tend to blend well, but there are some charming and even comical moments that sneak in  sometimes during the moments that Julian is expressing regret for things said or done, or not said or done. He attempts to make amends, but this isn't about the profound moments – no, it's about the small ones. When Julian mutters the brilliant line, ""I used to be a romantic hero"", we know exactly what it means. This isn't the usual tear-jerker, but it will likely tug at the heart strings, even as it touches on death on one's own terms (a common cinematic theme these days)."
