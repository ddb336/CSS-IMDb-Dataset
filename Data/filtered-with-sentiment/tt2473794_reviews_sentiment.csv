" Strange man
",-0.2023,0.8621,2020-11-23 00:00:00,8,"And a bit odd and eccentric too. But the main feature of this movie is the brilliant performance of Timothy Stall as the protagonist the famous British painterJMW Turner not only by his physical characterization but also for his acting, behaviour and talk. This movie shows some episodes of the painter's life, some of them not praiseworthy such as a sudden sexual abuse of his woman employee (although she didn' offer any resistance) and his visit to a brothel taking a prostitute to a room and asking her to show her breasts. He has also an odd relationship with his father (though not a bad one) and also with some of his fellow painters. He has also been tied to a ship's mast during a storm at sea to watch the storm in order to be able to paint it. This movie has also some wonderful views of landscapes, seascapes and urban areas with a faithful reproduction of 19th century first half atmosphere, surroundings and people figures. An interesting story to follow and well filmed and directed."
" Great character study, but .....
",0.3716,0.9053,2020-11-05 00:00:00,8,"... despite the great acting, directing, casting, dialogue and PHENOMENAL CINEMATOGRAPHY (which comes as close as possible to doing justice to the artist), it is a bit slow. The man was interesting, but there was very little 'tension' or dramatic interest, and so I finally had to fast-forward. But beautiful scenes, settings."
" A fabulous biopic
",0.5267,0.9694,2020-07-31 00:00:00,8,"This was a film of impact, a really really great production with a performance by Timothy spall that boggles the mind. He was one of the truly great Masters of the last couple of centuries, he was not a terribly impressive man, but he sure was an impressive painter! The things that he captured on canvas, the light, the pulse, the energy, resonate to this day.This is a very, very good film, great direction, writing and performances."
" Crass depiction of a great painter
",0.6249,0.7962,2020-06-26 00:00:00,4,"Let me start by saying that the cinematography is quite good. Unfortunately, nothing else is.This movie is repetitive, patchy and boring. What a grotesque and crass portrayal of a great painter's life! Since the movie depicts the last 25 years of Turner's life, we never get to see how he grew and matured as an artist. To me, that's the most important aspect of a film based on an artist's life. Otherwise, what's the point?Maybe it's just me, but I felt that the actor playing the part of Turner Senior was miscast since he didn't look old enough to be the painter's father. An elder brother, maybe. But not old enough to be the father.Watch this only if you must, for example if you were writing a thesis on Turner's later years; otherwise just steer clear."
" A Brilliant Work of Art
",0.5859,0.991,2020-04-09 00:00:00,10,"MR. TURNER tells the story of the famous painter during his later years. Some have complained that the film is disjointed and lacks a clear narrative, but for me it is a very ingenious take on this man's life.The acting is some of the best I've seen in years, and the writing and directing are brilliant. The pacing is perfect and the dialog is some of the best I've heard in any film ever. Scene after scene is totally brilliant and original and had me grinning from the first frame to the last. Highly recommend."
" Unique Structure - Unique Results
",0.0,0.9925,2020-03-24 00:00:00,8,"Mr. Turner is an interesting film for a variety of reasons, all of which I personally enjoyed. For starters it breaks the mold when it comes to a traditional movie format, and instead opts for a format that instead gives us vignettes into Turner's life. Key moments that weave together into an, albeit jumpy at times and somewhat disjointed storyline, yet very enjoyable film. Because the film establishes this jumpy nature early on it doesn't feel out of place by the end of the film, it also allows us to see much more of Turner's life than any traditionally styled film would be able to accomplish. It is also clear throughout the entire film that Mike Leigh and his team cared deeply about the authenticity of the film they were creating. Each shot is brimming with details of every size which only add to the great performances of the cast, all amplified by the amazing cinematography that runs throughout the entire film. This dedication to accuracy and authenticity is further emphasised when you learn that Timothy Spall, the actor who plays Turner, spent two years during production learning how to paint with oil and watercolor to make his performance more authentic, or how how the crew used the information in Turner's actual journals to know what he wanted his home to look like and make the set match that vision. All in all Mr. Turner is a great movie that takes incredible leaps in an effort to be authentic and respect Turner and his work, and tell his story to a new audience. I personally enjoyed this film a great deal and would highly recommend it."
" Inspiration In A Visual & Physical Sense
",0.5267,0.9971,2019-12-24 00:00:00,10,"Another biopic from 2014. Mike Leigh is able to separate this from many other films that were released this year. This one actually looks good, doesn't try to do too much, and capitalizes on Timothy Spall's excellent performance.We had to do some research regarding J.M.W. Turner before watching this one. We had not even heard the name before we got into watching this film. It was unclear to us why Leigh wanted to make a film about the painter in the first place. We had read he was an eccentric guy, but nothing really stood out to us that would make for a compelling film. But that's not the kind of source material Leigh needs to create a great film. Timothy Spall takes on a character that could stand alone without any sort of back-story. With the help of some amazing production and costume design, the world comes to life. Of all the biopics to be released this year, we finally found one that feels like it's own film.We always find it daunting to sit down and watch anything over two hours. You get about an hour in and realize it's not a great film but then there's no way out. With a shorter film you can wait it out. For something of this length you're trapped in the seat for the length of another film. We tend to research films with longer runtimes more carefully. Mike Leigh actually uses the two and half hours to make the story work. The arc of the character isn't rushed. It plays out naturally, slower manner, kind of reflecting the ""simpler times"" kind of attitude this film reflects. And it looks amazing. That alone will keep you interested. It makes the British landscape which often times looks very drab, look like a painting. It leads you to discover the inspiration behind Mr. Turner's work. That is a revelation.Theory of Everything was a poorly stylized romantic drama featuring an amazing performance by Eddie Redmayne. The Imitation Game was a movie about a rule breaker that followed too many rules. American Sniper was a love letter to patriotism and war movies. Foxcatcher was Steve Carrell trying to win an Academy Award. Of all these movies stretching across a common theme this year we have to say that either Mr. Turner or Selma take the cake for best execution. Those are the two films in the category we watched that we found inspiration in, in a visual and physical sense. Mike Leigh knows what he's doing."
" Classic
",0.0,0.4927,2019-08-12 00:00:00,10,One of my all time favourites. A thoroughly enjoyable presentation of an enigmatic character. Will revisit this many times.
" A Complex Movie that I Didn't Understand
",0.0,0.5053,2019-07-29 00:00:00,4,"Perhaps it is just my opinion, but this slow burn movie did not seem to leave much impact on me other than showing just how hard it can be to be an artist living in his time. I understand this may not be my kind of movie, but I do usually connect with more indpendent films like ""The Old Man and the Gun."""
" Good, but Not Leigh's Best
",-0.5577,0.9827,2019-06-24 00:00:00,7,"This is a good movie, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it great. It boasts many of the same things that keep bringing me back to Leigh: interesting characters, a well written script, and amazing attention to detail, but I felt as if the story itself could've been trimmed by a half hour, and I couldn't help but feel like it was missing the heart that made me obsess over Leigh's other movies. If you've an interest in classical paintings or Victorian era Britain, you'll probably enjoy this movie (I'm certainly glad I watched it, even if it wasn't my favorite Leigh movie)- but if you're looking for somewhere to start with Leigh, I wouldn't suggest starting here. Start with Secrets & Lies, Naked, Topsy-Turvy, or ""Life is Sweet"".

" Beautiful film but no story
",-0.09,0.991,2019-06-24 00:00:00,4,"The film is visually stunning but there's no depth. You never come to understand the artist or the relationships around him. He goes places, he sketches, the scenery is breathtaking and that is it. You never really see his work in much detail. Some people pop in an out with drama but who are they? You never know what they're about or what any of it means. As a biopic it fails because you really learn nothing. Take the 1956 Lust For Life with Kirk Douglas, you learn something of Vincent Van Gogh and his work. In this film you really learn nothing. It's a series of scenes that are often remote.
The actors are superb and they do their job. I've loved Timothy Spall in everything he's done and Dorothy Atkinson as Housekeeper Hannah Danby is superb. She's a constant in the film and doesn't say much but her performance is quietly powerful. It's worth watching if only for the fact it makes you curious who this painter was. He left behind an amazing volume of work and it's worth a look. I'll be checking our museums to see if his work is displayed. I think it's amazing, expecially if you've had expressionists up to your eye balls."
" Very good acting
",0.4927,0.9426,2019-06-05 00:00:00,9,A beautiful picture about a great painter. Not an exiting story but a very good insight in the life of this extraordinary man. I loved it!
" Mao killed the artists as they found no authority in the external, thus a danger to the state.
",-0.8689,-0.91,2019-05-10 00:00:00,10,"Here the invention of the camera heralds cinema, both dismantling, deconstructing the past via 'recording', turning Turner's health south right after that. The film is about the beauty of the artist's mind rivaling god. See how his work exposes his fear of being witnessed as in is his language is not words. How he is a terror to his family and a burden to everyone around him. He is a demon of neglect. The painterly shots show he is constantly in search. He can't not see. Even viewing his own family from the detachment of a frame not partaking in their melodramas. Cinema stares at its early ancestor. Leigh understands, puzzles and relates painting through his own form. One key is like Leigh, Turner constantly brings home he is 'of the people'. He thumbs his nose at intellectual society. They're bored when he has their audience. He's genuinely surprised at the performance mocking him, and feels mutual scorn when The Queen scoffed at his work. Art as the working class. Also why he pitied the other artist and spared him his debt, seeing outsider kinship with him. The film concludes with the two loves reactions. Nihilism is the wrong reading but how his neglect externalized as her rotting skin, and by extension, the world around him rotting. Not only is the film damning of him but preaching balance through objectivity requires our attention. ""The sun is god."" Rather, ""The self is god."" Then as the world lead toward streamlining industry, those new paintings show the fear in efficiency as retreating into religiosity, showing Turner as knowing prophetic victor.
Post-Note: It made my top ten of the 2010s."
" Grunt away Spall
",0.0,0.0,2019-02-25 00:00:00,6,This movie has the most grunting I have ever seen. Watch it with the subtitles on. So many (GRUNTS) and (GRUNTING). If you're into that then this movie is for you.
" Disappointing for the great Mike Leigh
",0.2263,0.8402,2019-02-16 00:00:00,6,"The subject of the film is J.M.W. Turner (1775 - 1851), a renowned British landscape artist. The film covers the last twenty-five years of his life and begins at the point when he is already a successful artist. ""Mr. Turner"" is written and directed by Mike Leigh and Timothy Spall plays the lead role.Within the first forty minutes or so, the film successfully recalls a time and place where the manners and language are very unique and different. The costumes, set design, and photography add beautifully to this other universe especially the stunning landscape scenery.I'm a great fan of Mike Leigh especially for the films ""Secrets and Lies"" (1995) and ""Another Year"" (2010) among a few others. Sadly, I believe ""Mr. Turner"" does not meet the bar met by these other films.Spall has done great work for Leigh in the past especially in ""Secrets and Lies"". He does a fine job as Turner using very odd but believable characteristics. While he portrays the frailty of aging well, he didn't seem to evolve or change emotionally throughout the story, particularly in a scene near the end when he hears very disturbing news. This causes the two and a half hours to pass rather slowly especially considering that some other scenes seem odd and out of place.In some smaller roles, there were some character actors who did very well with limited time on-screen including Marion Bailey as a landlady on a seaside resort; Dorothy Atkinson as a quiet housekeeper who conveys her misery with her facial and body language; Lesley Manville (superb in ""Another Year"") as a scientist who helps Turner with his art; Joshua McGuire as a young art critic from a privileged family whose enthusiastic commentaries are amusingly pompous; and Ruth Sheen, also amusing as a bitter ex-lover who speaks congenial words in a tone that is the opposite of congenial."
" Scenes from a life
",0.0,0.8248,2018-10-28 00:00:00,6,"J.M.W. Turner is widely regarded as one of Britain's greatest artists. As portrayed by Timothy Spall in Mike Leigh's film, he was a taciturn, curmudgeonly individual, far from the model of the cultured gentleman. Leigh mostly works, of course, in a contemporary setting, and often features eccentrics and misfits. But in a Victorian setting, it's harder to assess the output: are we seeing crude, Deickensian caracitures, or what are actually subtle portraits, just in an alien milleu? In places the film just works - some scenes are deeply imbued with the character-driven black comedy that typifies Leigh's best work. But elsewhere I found it dragging, perhaps because there's no real plot - just a portrait of a life already well-established when the film begins, and consequently, one that only becomes truly moving as it approaches its end."
" A masterpiece
",0.6249,0.383,2018-07-15 00:00:00,10,"The portrayal of Turner by Timothy Spall is nothing short of a masterpiece. It deals with the incredibly complex and famous British painter, Joseph Turner, who is full of faults and haunted by personal demons: a true outsider who is allowed access into the upper class due to his brilliance as a landscape painter. If you want to watch a movie about a real human and the real people around him, see the movie now. Spall is superb."
" Practically perfect
",0.5719,0.6249,2018-05-19 00:00:00,9,Mr Turner is beautiful quiet contemplative sensual moving. Timothy Spall becomes Turner before your eyes. Guessing that many negative reviewers felt the movie was too slow or that it was hard to watch the depiction of such a complicated human being. That's why I liked it. Slow and deliberate like the process of a painting.
" Turbulent and epic end of life
",0.0,0.2794,2018-03-30 00:00:00,7,"This film goes distance in revealing the master painter Turner, England's best. Nice to discover how the fellow was. Scruff but witty and not francophobe like the common english. Refreshing film!"
" One of those rare perfect movies
",0.5719,0.9983,2018-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Mr. Turner, the biopic of the last 25 years in the life of British Painter William Turner is an absolute triumph.
Not many movies manage to not have any weak points at all. But Mike Leigh manages to craft this picture with the precision of the most skilled painter. A work of direction so elegant, so polished, so precise, that locates Leigh among the most talented directors working today. The script serves as the foundation stone to what I can only describe as a very immmersive experience. The long conversations between the characters are truly fascinating, but the best aspect of the script is the moments when Leigh tells the story with silence. These quiet moments when we can only hear the background noice and perhaps a little bit of music at times, is what make the viewer so invested in the story. The cinematography, work of Dick Pope, is absolutely breath-taking. Every single frame looks like a painting worth hanging in an art gallery. It manages to capture the colours and feel of expressionism, which fits perfectly with Mr. Turner's story. The score, work of composer Gary Yershon, while simple, fits the movie beautifully. Costumes, courtesy of Jacqueline Durran, are beautifuly tailored and work very well with the cour palette of the sets and locations. Suzie Davies and Charlotte Dirickx constructed sets so meticulously crafted that feels like every old paintbrush Turner owns has a purpose. But by far the best aspect of the movie is Mr. Turner himself. Timothy Spall gives the performance of a lifetime. He is not playing Turner, he is Turner! There are so many aspects and details in his performance that truly made him one of the best characters of the year 2014. Is not only the way he deliver his dialogues, which is what you may expect from what's defined as a ""good performance"", but the way he grunts, the way he walks, the expression in his eyes when he is bothered by something, as opposed to when he feels facination, sadness or confusion, the way he moves his lips when he isn't talking, everything is delivered amazingly, and I can't remember the last time an actor got so robbed of an Oscar nomination. 
What may put a lot of people off is the length of it. And yes, it is 150 minutes long, but I believe that all scenes are there for a reason, even the ones that are inconsequential are never boring and serve a purpose in the development of the character.
Overall, this movie is an example of what a biopic should be. And the way it made me feel while watching it, the way it made me feel afterwards, makes be give this movie the perfect score. When I say this movie is perfect, I don't mean that there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. In my opinion there are no movies 100% free of flaws, but this is as perfect as a movie gets."
" How not to make an interesting biopic
",0.4019,0.9652,2017-09-01 00:00:00,4,"A great biopic tells the story behind the story so that we learn about how things came to be. Instead what we see in the story of Mr Turner is a collection of well known stories linked together with no exploration beyond these onto the screen.William Turner created some of the greatest landscape paintings that inspired generations after him. We know the stories, in particular how we was lashed to mask in storm so that he could be inspired to his fabulous Steam Boat in a Storm painting. Except we know that story. We know the painting. It is interesting to see it on the big screen, but the movie contributes nothing to our understanding of this event.In the same way it contributes nothing to the whole story of Turner's life other than some little snippets that are loosely linked together. We don't see his youth, his inspiration, his great struggles. This is nothing but a collection of anecdotes rather than a story or a movie. ."
" Portrait of the artist as both a man & visionary
",0.5267,0.9979,2017-03-21 00:00:00,7,"Not usually a fan of Mike Leigh's work, but thoroughly enjoyed this film, which is slow-paced & impressionistic, with distinct scenes that seem apparently unrelated, but which harmonise into a whole. Leigh's film echoes Turner's approach to art: both take an unorthodox approach. Leigh's film does not possess a linear narrative, but is a series of impressions that hang together (like pictures in an exhibition) to form an organic whole. A cynic might wonder if Leigh views himself as a latter day incarnation of Turner as an artist (misunderstood).The film (three hours) is structured around Turner & his relationships, firstly with his beloved father & loyal maid-servant Danby in London; secondly with a landlady he meets on his painting trips to the Kent seaside; & the final strand, about the ageing painter with his contemporaries, nascent art criticism (Ruskin's intellect contrasts with Turner's intuitive, instinctual approach), with the public (ridicule) & royalty, a man seemingly out of touch with new movements (the pre-Raphaelites) , fearful of being forgotten though still retaining faith in his own distinctive artistic vision ('it will come': understanding), whose genius is appreciated by the few (the compassionate doctor), a man ahead of his time anticipating the new French art movement to come.The film is the study of an inarticulate man but one with a very deep instinct & artistic vision, a man fuelled by both a passion for art & the sensual. There are echoes of Hesse & his multiplicity of selves, in the way Turner is a man both of sublime vision but also of powerful sexual drives (his sexual exploitation of his long-suffering maid-servant). He is a visionary but also a loving son, socially awkward, moody & grunting assent yet capable of deep feeling & passion (his faltering yet moving rendition of Purcell). These multiple personalities are reflected in how those around him address him: to his father & estranged mother of his children, he is simply 'Billy', to his contemporaries (Constable) 'William' & 'Turner' & in the upper echelons as 'Mr Turner'.'Mr Turner' is also about his relationship with those around him, in particular, his beloved father, 'Daddy', Mrs Booth, the landlady with whom he finds content & loving understanding of the whole man, the unfortunate Danby, loving but neglected & Benjamin Haydon, a fellow artist.This artistic relationship provides a fascinating strand to the story & a real undertow of tragedy for we know history saw Turner vindicated, but what happens to the artist who is mediocre & whose sacrifice proves vain? Haydon, too, is a man of passion, anarchic, angry at being derided & whose outbursts provide vitriolic black humour. He is, sadly, a rebel without a cause. (Researching Haydon's life following the film, he committed suicide. Dickens, usually so compassionate in his books, made a caustic appraisal of Haydon's work).Both Haydon & Turner are marginalised & misunderstood by their contemporaries, though one is ridiculed for a lack of talent ('Self portrait of an ass'), the other for being innovative, respected but regarded as veering off into his own eccentric direction (the scene in the RA where he apparently ruins a picture, but then smears over the paint). Such relationships throw a kind of chiaroscuro, light & dark, (tonal contrasts) over proceedings so that we see Turner in different kinds of light (light being central to his work as an artist). Turner's talent allows him to flit between the social worlds of aristocratic salons & the brothel.Thank heavens for Film4 +1 as one scene completely left me befuddled & yet after watching it again, this challenging scene is probably the emotional key to understanding the film & the man. This is the scene with the experiment regarding colour & light undertaken by Mary Somerville (Lesley Manville), a scientist. The experiment about the magnetic pole & spectrum of colours reflects both Turner's personality (artistic, sexual, a man of contradictions) & the impressionistic nature/vision of the film itself, contradictory elements that harmonise into a whole. It is also a scene where the normally inarticulate Turner is voluble as if the nature of science justifies his vision of art, of capturing light & shade.The final scene, of the artist out in the open air as seen through the loving eyes of his companion harks back to the opening one set in the dusk of the Dutch countryside, of a free spirit out in the open air."
" Meh
",-0.0772,-0.8566,2017-03-04 00:00:00,5,"A day after watching the movie, I am still not certain about the way I feel about it, hence the 5/10. Mr Turner is a beautiful film to look at: the cinematography, the framing of the images, the colours, the are all extremely well done. I was only let down by the cardboard houses and harbour at Margate, that was like looking at a cheap operadécor. Everything actually filmed on location looks marvellous and romantic. The atmosphere in the Victorian Houses and at the Academy are also captured very well.I don't know if it was intentionally meant by the director/producer, but never could I sympathize with the Turner character. He's rude, sometimes a pervert, but mostly grumpy and boorish. If those were indeed the main characteristics of Turner, then Spall did a great job. However, it was very hard to unsee Spall's Peter Pettigrew (Harry Potter) and I find he even uses some of the same eccentric actingtrics in this movie. He huffs, puffs and groans throughout the movie, I found it very tiresome. Neither could I see the attraction Mrs Booth had to have to this grumpy old man. There were too few scenes in the movie to justify their apparently loving relationship.But Turner is a movie about a painter! I was so disappointed that only 10% of the time you can actually see him paint. I read Spall took art classes for 2 years, but that was waste of time and money, because you can hardly see hem hold a brush, let alone actually paint. The movie never reveals his reasons for painting, his convictions nor his passions. I don't understand his relationship with Haydon, Constanble nor the other painters, but he loves the camaraderie of the Academy. He seems to have contempt for the paintings of the pre-rafaellites, but it was a fact that he was a fan of their work. I was mostly disappointed by his mocking of John Ruskin - in a scene at Ruskin's house with his parents - which seemed to me totally disrespectful towards the Ruskins, who have just bought one of his paintings.The movie is a sequential series of fragments. Some of them seem out of place and unimportant. For me it made it hard to warm to it. It has not made me want to know more about Turner, which usually is a sign that the movie has not enough quality, despite the beautiful cinematography."
" Huge disappointment
",-0.25,0.7992,2017-02-15 00:00:00,3,"Having seen Leo McKern in an excellent TV movie about Turner titled ""The Sun is God"", I was eagerly looking forward to this film. For me, it failed on virtually every account. I wanted to know why Turner got out of bed in the morning to chase the sun and the light. I wanted to know what drove him to paint such wonderful pictures, and what technique he used. I wanted to feel his inspiration. I was appalled by the directors offensive portrayal of John Ruskin, who was an amazing man, a great writer, an ecologist (who took on the polluting Mill owners and struck a blow for the environment) a wonderful watercolour artist in his own right and a champion of Turner. The one redeeming scene was of The Fighting Temeraire being towed away on the Thames. This is often voted one of Britains favourite pictures, and there it was on the cinema screen, brought to life. Sadly - the incredible artist Turner was not brought to life - but reduced to a grotesque soulless caricature."
" Turner as fodder for Director's craft.
",0.0,0.9373,2017-01-20 00:00:00,6,"The Bad Either I am watching an attempt at an accurate biographical account or I am not. Leigh inventing a story line that traduces Turner's character because it ""felt right"" is an important step too far. Not that he appears to have been a saint. Turner was sacrificed for Leigh's craft. It also did not tell a tale, more a series of barely related events, which themselves were not followed up eg. Haydon. Turner's father looked in some ways younger than Turner with more of a twinkle in his eye, so a very questionable portrayal. I also could not hear what was being said at the beginning of the film; maybe this was intentional but let's have a few subtitles to poke fun at this stupidity. The Good. Beautifully shot and great atmosphere."
