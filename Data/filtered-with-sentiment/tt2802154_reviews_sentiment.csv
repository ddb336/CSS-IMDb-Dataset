" sad insight into the countryside living in Russia and brilliant portrayal of family life under strain.
",0.128,-0.7884,2021-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Rather long but completely involving and vivid portrait of a family struggling to survive against the elements and harshness of the immediate environment, made worse by the activities a of a corrupt local mayor and his aspirations. There is much soul searching with devastating references to the State and the orthodox church and we see the fragility of relationships under this outside pressure exasperated by the imbibing of incredible amounts of vodka. Not just generous portions but bottle tipped on its end pouring or even straight from the bottle whilst wandering about. A fabulous look is achieved with the help of wonderful cinematography even if everywhere looks pretty bleak. Can be a little confusing where the director leaves out key scenes so as to gradually introduce the effects later but in the meantime there is a temptation to wonder if you missed something. Rather sad insight into the countryside living in Russia and brilliant portrayal of family life under strain."

" Beware: Two Hour Commercial For The Russian Orthodox Church
",0.0,0.9708,2020-07-30 00:00:00,3,"Sigh. I really wanted to like this film, too. The music was mesmerizing. In fact, i didn't read the ending credits, but I'm 99% sure the hypnotic, repetitive music was by Philip Glass. The cinematography was breathtaking and the overall acting wasn't so bad. So why the poor rating? The preachiness. ""Leviathan"" was nothing more than a church's moral story about how to live a good life in the eyes of the lord. Thanks, but no thanks. If i wanted to be preached to, there are are numerous churches around here for that. Thanks, though, ""Leviathan"", for introducing me to borscht and dumpling soup. I must try it some time."
" Very powerful in all it's gloom
",-0.1298,0.6369,2020-07-07 00:00:00,9,"One of the best films ever made in my opinion. It's dark, hyper realistic and moving from the first to the last second. A real film."
" Vokda and venality make for a potent mix...
",0.0,0.9774,2020-06-25 00:00:00,7,"This is a salutary lesson in the abuse of power, and it's told in a gripping, if rather sad, fashion. The mayor (Roman Madyanov) of a small town on the Barents Sea has his eye on a property built (by hand) by local man ""Kolya"" (Aleksey Serebryakov) for his wife and son. When ""Kolya"" finds himself on the wrong end of a court ruling that could cost him everything, he recruits a friend from Moscow - now a lawyer - in the hope that he can help fight back. Perhaps not surprisingly, this is all impacting heavily on his friends and family and it isn't too long before vodka is becoming his best friend. It's got a well crafted score and some beautiful photography of the remote, sometimes bleak locale as the story all starts to come to an head. The acting isn't the best, the boy ""Romka"" (Sergey Pokhodaev) really under-delivers in his quite important role, as does Elena Lyadova (Lilya) as his mother. That doesn't really distract, however, for a tensely delivered thriller that casts a critical eye over small town (Russian) politics - complete with photographs of Vladimir Putin, and that has you cheering for the little guy with small hope of success!"
" Disgraceful
",0.0,0.1406,2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"In a Ryssian coastal town of the Barents Sea lives a couple with a young boy who is son of the husband's first marriage. They are being harassed by a corrupt mayor who wants to take their land, house and a car repair-shop from them. It looks like they must accept it because they have lost all court procedures against it. This is the movie main plot but from a certain moment on there is a subplot because the wife engages herself in adultery with an attornery that had come from Moscow to help the couple to fight the expropriation. This ends tragically, The movie is not exceptionally deep in psychological terms but the story is dramatic enough to keep our attention and well acted and directed."
" Long and dreary below average film
",-0.34,0.8367,2020-06-10 00:00:00,5,"I had quite high hopes for the film from the start. Unfortunately, my hopes came burning down with charred skeletal remains of wings. The film had a plot of sorts, but it actually ended in middle of the story - only to return to it at the end of the film. It was as if the screenwriter could not decide which of the two plots they had designed was the one carrying the film forward.Most of the time, the film seemed like a random collection of events. The scenes had some string attached to them, theoretically binding them together, but even that felt far stretched and thin. There were scenes that could have been cut off from the movie without having an effect on the plot. I understand that it is hard to edit your own baby, but in this case, cutting this to 1 hour and some 20 to 30 minutes would have done this a huge favor.Nice scenery and an impression on Russian life that most western people have no experience of. Reminded me of childhood trip to Soviet Union. The buildings were pretty much in the same shape already in the 80s. As a film this does not stand out from the crowd."
" A Symbolic Voyage Into The Small Fishing Town of Northern Russia
",0.0,-0.8049,2020-06-08 00:00:00,9,"Leviathan is symbolic voyage into the hearts and intimate lives of Kolya, Lilya, Roma and Dima. The film shed lights on the ""little man"" motif of the Russian art, portraying tragedy and an irony of fate as experienced by a Nikolay. It is full of symbolisms, which makes it for an intelligent, sophisticated experience. Nuances in scripture are used in reference to the life events of the little man, Kolya.God, Truth, and Fate are discussed given the backdrop of Kolya's search for meaning. That, the film does masterly, exploring the ways religion interweaves with state in fascinating ways. In turn, themes ranging from fatherhood and emotional distance, friendship and betrayal, deception and drunkenness are meticulously portrayed, all the while informing the viewer of nuances of the lives and feelings of characters.In sum, Leviathan bears witness to loss, to glimpses of hope, and to the rise of an ironic unfolding among the poor and the wealthy, the powerful and the powerless. This is a film that leaves no empty figures, but the fullness of fate, power, and the paying for a crime is hasn't committed."

No emotional depths to be found here ; even though the immersive cinematography looks promising initially it's charm is lost as the story seems to go nowhere.A thorough disappointment."

" Leviathan overwhelms its vodka-induced characters with serpentine trenchant ambition.
",-0.2023,-0.9934,2020-01-24 00:00:00,9,"""Truth is with us. The Lord's love is with us, and in defending our faith, we will not liken ourselves to our enemies, but just as Christ, shed light on the truth and unmasked the lies with one word"". The Eastern Orthodox Church expands its faith upon the mortals on this bitter land, consuming individuals with words of enlightenment. Preventing God's words from seclusion. But much like the Church, the current Russian State entangles its cold reptilian limbs across the Siberian landscape, devouring the innocent lives it promised to nurture. For it is the tyranny of man that exhumes greed and gluttony. Reaping affluence through gargantuan unstoppable powers. Masquerading totalitarianism within its falsely advertised democracy.Zvyagintsev's most ambitious work to date is an insight into the social issues of contemporary Russia, or more specifically, the Putin administration. Tragedy strikes Kolya and his family when the local mayor takes legal action to expropriate the land on which his house is built. Paralleling the theological work behind the Book of Job, Zvyagintsev addresses theodicy by comparatively illustrating the despotism of the Church and the State. The mayor, corrupting everything he glances upon, representing the political detriments that Russia currently faces. He is the leviathan. Kolya embodies Job, and his close friends oppressed by the local council depict Job's three friends. Zvyagintsev equips biblical text, modernises its literal substance to suit current Russian society and still, much like the book, investigated the problems of divine justice. The damnation of the righteous.Through his unflinching direction, he illustrates the presumption of innocence only to be juxtaposed by divinity. ""Innocent until proven guilty"" repeatedly states Kolya's lawyer friend. Yet even he succumbs to the behemoth-like powers of the mayor. Punishing his blackmailing sin through, what is considered, retributive justice. The omniscience and omnipotence of the State, likens itself to a deity. The antithesis of what it represented. What the people voted for. What the people wanted. Again, Zvyagintsev takes a neutral standpoint when depicting the family's tragedy, neither attacking or praising the current climate of contemporary Russia. And with that unbiased narrative, he's able to project his aspiration through clinical precision. Every single frame is handled with the utmost importance. Character actions are natural responses to any given situation, not forced reactions to condemn a particular body.Consequently, the neutrality of Leviathan produces Zvyagintsev's most formidable feature yet. It is bleak. Depressing. Intimidating. Soul-crushingly wretched. Blustery chills that shroud the fictional town of Pribrezhny flow through the screen and into your body. It's, unfortunately, real. And that ornate sense of reality enhances Leviathan's staying power. Krichman's much improved cinematography, from vanishing points illustrating loss of belief to harsh waves crashing on sharp cliffs, assists in building a world where the powerful rule. Performances from the entire cast were exceptionally nuanced. Serebryakov's hotheaded temper fluctuated extravagantly, granting Kolya a guarded aura. Madyanov as the mayor exhumed tyranny through expressionistic anger and corruption. Yet it was Lyadova's muted performance that shattered my heart. Fulfilling a connection with my own soul with just her eyes alone. Breathtaking acting.Glass' noteworthy score also exemplified the grandeur of Leviathan's story. As with most of Zvyagintsev's filmography, some scenes were stretched out adding no substance to the plot, however I'm unable to claim that any should be cut. It's an arduous experience that should feel onerous for all the right reasons. And it does. The excess amount of vodka bottles drunk by depressed characters did somewhat tickle a stereotype that Western audiences often perceive. Although not a substantial detriment, far too excessive with minimal representation.Regardless, this remains Zvyaginsev's most alluring piece. Leviathan consumes. Leviathan corrupts. Leviathan devastates. A half-buried whale skeleton looms over the arid seas. Alone. Disintegrated. Dead. What was once a creature of grandiose stature, now lies in ruin. Forever witnessing the greed of tyranny engulfing the innocence of man. Forever suffering."
" Massively decompressed storytelling
",0.0,-0.1027,2019-11-25 00:00:00,1,"It took 70 minutes before anything of even slight significance occurred. I really don't understand why anyone would want to retell the old, old, story of civic corruption in such a bland, unnuanced, way. A complete waste of time. (I watched the first 85 minutes and then fast-forwarded through the remainder.)"
" Bleak, depressing and captivating
",-0.3818,0.9899,2019-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Andrey Zvyagintsev's Leviathan is one of the bleakest depressing films I've ever seen.
Kolya is a downtrodden man who attempts to fight back against a corrupt Major who wants his land to build a 'research center'. Kolya gets his lawyer friend from Moscow to come to his aid but this only brings more misfortune to Kolya who reaches his wits' end.
This is a bleak and unforgiving drama. Set against a small coastal town in an area of Russia that is wind swept, wild and inhospitable you get a feeling that you are on the edge of the world. Even the characters look aged by weathering as they try and offset their injustices by swilling Vodka like it's water. Hoping that the beast of corruption will just disappear in their drunken state.
And therein lies Leviathan's political statement during a Putin era where the ordinary downtrodden man has not an ounce of a chance against the relentless & corrupt leviathan-like alliance of the church and the state. You really get a sense of what it would be like to contest the unfairness of the Russian court system, as the corrupt judge reads out her judgements unflinchingly, robot-like without emotion, ignoring all the man's appeals of misjustice.
Performances are all excellent and incredibly grounded in their roles. Encouraged by the Director to use the minimum of facial expression to convey their own dispair. Aleksey Serebryakov as Kolya & Elena Lyadova as Kolya's wife are especially great.
With muted cinematography by Mikhail Krichman adding another layer of bleakness to the proceedings and the framing of expansive shots by Zvyagintsev Leviathan is an astounding piece of filmmaking. Maybe a little too long in running time but it's a powerful drama that will stay with you for a good while afterwards."
" Affecting and Satirical!
",0.0,-0.6378,2019-08-19 00:00:00,9,The movie proves that it's possible to create a hard criticism with no agitative text or no exaggerated presentation of political message.Zyvagintsev has knitted very powerful sub-texts on corruption of both humanity and the state institutions (including the church) within an ordinary story of a real property court.
" Zvyagintsev´s masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9341,2019-08-15 00:00:00,9,"Another great movie from Andrey Zvyagintsev. This movie shows a well-known problem of the political aspect, in rural town/region in Russia, but not just in Russia. There are many towns and villages that political hypocrites are trying to rule with it. They do not choose a weapon, but in many cases, they are protected by Church organizations or party leaders.This movie shows the perfect picture of that kind of society. At one side you have native man, who lives in same house and place as his grandpa and father, and on the other side, you have local ""cowboy"" who thinks that he can do anything because he has power and money. Supported by local mafia and church. With the main thing on his mind ... win the election no matter what, using all kinds of ""weapon"" to reach the main goal.In the region that is very oriented to the Church, he has an easy way to win an election. Build something (Orthodox Church) and give something to people, no matter of cost or way how you get it. Character Nikolay is an unlucky guy. Has a property that interests the Mayor. This brings with it major problems for Nikolay and his family. Besides that, Nikolay is trying to solve and overcome problems in the family, especially with his wife. Everything ends tragically. ""Small man"" destroyed by local ""cowboy"".The hard movie, with real-life problems that are shown perfectly. All misery of life ruined by private inters of some rich guy with mayor function."
" Cliché upon cliché
",0.0,0.8586,2019-08-13 00:00:00,2,"This movie starts off well - you have about half an hour of interesting material. An innocent man is victime of corruption, and one of his friends, who is a lawyer in Moscow, comes to help him.Nonetheless curruption is in the way, etc. etc. etc.Then, out of the blue - contemporary art cliché #1 - the innocent man's wife starts an affair with the lawyer. Of course this is completely out of the blue, and has no previous link to anything, nor does it really make more sense than ""hum, i guess people are horny"".The movie, from then on, goes on a downward slope. All the interesting elements from the beginning disappear, and all you are left with is a bad rewrite of Jobe's story, with a lot of biblical references all over. It was a mix of very predictable, and ""crippled with plot holes"".The actors were quite ok, the scenery was beautiful, it was filmed ok, nonetheless, a poor and weak script, filled with clichés, upon clichés of déjà vu, doesn't do much for me, even if it's put in a Russian context.In this film you have about 30 minutes of interesting material. The rest is a waste of time, an absolute bore. After having seen this movie I was filled with annoyance at having wasted time seeing this very forgettable film, which for some reason was celebrated by an artsy-fartsy clique."
" Frusturating
",0.0,-0.5398,2019-05-01 00:00:00,2,"To use the story of Marvin Heemeyer as inspiation for this sorrymess is embarrassing. I guess the director really didn't understand the source material.
I remember seeing the directors other movie ""loveless""in the theater and was very unimpressed with how he used one story to metaphor a completely different story.
Just like this whatever the movie claims to be isn't what it is even about.
Not sure why we are shown scenarios and then not let them fill themselves out to a proper conclusion.
Just absolute trash that not even a good soundtrack, good acting, and great cinematography can help dressup.
Next time just make the movie you want to make and don't force the viewers down a rabbit hole of metaphors that don't mean a thing in the end.
And based on a real story maybe but changed the whole ending that made it a story in the first place.
Don't come in expecting a rampage at the end because I guess that was just a little too much for such an amateurish storyteller to give us.
Gonna write no spoilers because I wish someone had told me this was gonna frustrate me so much."
" Disproportional like it's hype and it's contribution to the cinematograph
",0.3612,0.6946,2019-03-29 00:00:00,5,"Well. let me start with introducing myself, i am citizen of Russian Federation and i'm kinda biased in this case. Narrative is a reflection of living in nearly all cities and towns and being a part of this time and culture. Leviathan is the only russian Oskar nominee, so i was exited about watching this film. And also this film received pathetic unconvincing criticism, so everything lead me to the thought that film is really good. And i should say, most scenes look extremely realistic, actors doing good, good shooting, and also a couple of interesting artistic devices. But there are a lot of thing's that absolutely destroys the status of this film: some of important and the most important scenes looks weak and lame( drunk scenes, Kolya talking with a priest), not ever realistic, this movie not gonna surprise you at all, production is lower than average, many events happens behind the scenes and we should think out what happened on our own, way too much events, zero depth. So, even having a good mood and being beased, can't recommend this movie at all, tho' i realy think that it's important to show this unpleasent truth. It's obvious that hype, Oskars and other regalia means nothing, so such an average movie can get the fame fo this level. I know i always had more strict taste than lots of people. still i ask you to think about everything you see on the screen, not eat everything culture gives you.And i also suppouse we should have diffirent attitude to the overrated and underrated movies. Even if everything was good i think this movies would barely got 7 from me, cause level of immersion is not that big. and I think it's takes immense effort to get a big rate by pure reflection. I can say that ""Blue is the warmest colour"" is also movie about life, the story of 2 people, what did Leviathan to suppouse that it is a bigger film? Nothing, at the same time being highly overrated and pretengious it get's rate lower than BIWC."
" loss of faith
",0.128,0.9961,2019-02-08 00:00:00,8,"'Leviathan' directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev is a movie about faith. Russian literature and cinema are populated by heroes who are confronted with power and faith, the two spiritual components (but also historic institutions) whose combination and close relationship has always dominated the lives of Russians both nationally and personally. The last century has challenged this historic symbiosis. For seven decades after 1917, the communist regime destroyed churches and monasteries and tried to establish atheist Marxism-Leninism as a state doctrine instead of the Orthodox Christianity. The fall of the Soviet regime led to the resurrection of the religious institutions, the rebuilding of churches and the building of many new ones. Does it also represent a return to faith? This question is acute in Russia and all over Eastern Europe. Corruption is the other main theme of the film. There is corruption at the level of the institutions (including the church), but especially there is corruption in the souls of the people.The landscape in which the action is taking place is that of an ecological disaster, maybe typical and symptomatic of Russia, although such areas of post-apocalyptic appearance exist elsewhere in the world. A retreating sea, wrecks of boats and ships, huge skeletons of prehistoric animals brought to light by the withdrawal of water. A world is obviously decomposing, but the place does not stay empty, there are signs of modernity, although modernity does not necessarily mean progress. The 'new world' that takes hold of these places seems dominated by corrupt authorities. The film's hero, Kolya (played by Aleksey Serebryakov ) is a fisherman. He is not exactly poor, he owns a house at the bend of a river, a boat, a car, has friends, a teenage son, and is also at his second marriage to Lilya (Elena Lyadova). All his life is destroyed in a short time after the local mayor decides to take possession of the land where his home is located and puts in move the justice and police system for this purpose. Kolya will not only be defeated in an uneven struggle with a system that does not hesitate to resort to any method to destroy him, but he realizes that he remained without any moral or spiritual support. Fallen in alcoholism, with his life and family destroyed, he asks why. The answer has nowhere to come from.Acting is excellent, Russian actors rarely deceive. Aleksey Serebryakov creates a complex and credible character. I was a little disappointed with Lilya's character, the wife of the hero, missing maybe some text or extra scenes explaining the motivation of her infidelity (an old love story? attraction to Moscow?). I liked the cinematography, spectacular and full of symbolism. I do not know how much courage is needed to make such a movie in Russia today. Director and co-screenwriter Andrey Zvyagintsev is attacking front-level corruption at the local level, and the desolate image of the scene where the action takes place is not flattering. His political criticism however stops at the periphery. The critical approach also targets the institutions of the church, and the parallel with 'Beyond the Hills', the film by the Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, was for me immediate. But there is also some hope. The only positive character is a priest from the ranks, whom we see helping his poor parishioners, a man who tries to make sense, console and provide an explanation to the film's hero about what is happening to him. For Kolya the answer comes too late, but perhaps for others there is hope in returning to the human foundations of faith. It's maybe the only positive message in this remarkable, but not very optimistic movie."
" An authentic and masterful portrayal of post-Soviet Russia
",0.0,0.9208,2019-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Somewhat unnecessarily long as this film manages to be, so well acted, directed and scripted it is that it easily passes the watch-checking criterion.Like almost all Russian films since 1992 it cannot but refer to a common visual iconography: the melancholic ruins of an empire - or even empires. stretching back to Tsarist times - destroyed as much by robber-capitalism opportunism and corruption as by any mere winds of change. Portending the future, even as far back as the 1970s - as in Stalker (1979) - Russian film settings have at times turned surreal-dystopic, depicting social disrepair and environmental blight. Yet the northern arctic coastline in which Leviathan is set is hauntingly beautiful, which only serves to make the human drama even more distressing.The characters and performances, not to mention the direction and cinematography, make for a film that flows magisterially from beginning to end. Even if there is the odd flaw in the storyline's coherence and stylishness.One reason certainly to see it is for its fabulously authentic portrayal of the notoriously corrupt Russian Orthodox church's hierarchy and its often ultra wealthy, corrupt and hypocritical or medievally simple worshippers. Yes, just like other organised religions, but even more conspicuous in the inequality and distress of post-Soviet Russia. And something that must be stated no matter how much one - like me - respects the people and the culture. Coral Browne and John Schlesinger were right, in the almost matchless masterpiece that is An Englishman Abroad, to relegate all the good that can be assigned to Russian Orthodoxy to the mere if undisputed choreographic aestheticism of its services. Opium of the people indeed, and no film makes that more apparent.Finally, a nod must always go to the genius of Phillip Glass' music and of its employment in any film. Leviathan joins an elite club, in company with The Fog of War and The Thin Blue Line, in this respect."
" Vodka and Despair
",-0.3182,-0.8821,2019-02-01 00:00:00,7,"In a small Russian coastal town, Kolya (well played by Aleksei Serebryakov) owns a beautiful seaside property that is inherited from at least two generations. The town's corrupt mayor and the various sleazy elements of bureaucracy that support him attempt to confiscate the property for a cheap price and use the property for a development project. Kolya's loose temper and alcoholism frustrate his struggle.The first section is intriguing in its exposure of deviousness in high places. The mid-section takes an unusual turn which is at first frustrating because it appears to be a typical subplot device - that is, until its repercussions take over as the main plot.There is another frustration when a very smart character does something uncharacteristically stupid, thus changing the outcome of the story. However, the impact of ""Leviathan"", depressing as it is, at least does the successful task of getting the viewer (me at least) out of one's head and into one's feelings which linger well after the film's completion. Be warned, though. These are difficult feelings.Before seeing this movie at my local cinematheque (TIFF Bell Lightbox inToronto), two staff members warned me of the impact. Their summary of the film was ""vodka and despair"". How true.Nearly every character drinks way too much vodka, especially Kolya, and the unfolding events in the last section are despair indeed. The film also takes a good swipe at corrupt Russian bureaucracy and the Russian Orthodox Church. This itself is courageous but we are unlikely to see such films again. The country's Ministry of Culture was upset by how Russia's people and church were portrayed in ""Leviathan"". Guidelines have now been set to ban such movies in the future."
" As 'dark' and depressing a movie as I have seen.

This movie also shows that even foreign films have nothing but loathing and animosity towards Christianity. The movie is built around a corrupt mayor in cahoots with a pious, pompous catholic priest, who is anything but a Christian leader, who tries to justify the evil acts of the mayor with false scripture and interpretations in order to get a church built. Everyone is a drunk, immoral, selfish, self-centered, self-serving, or some other manner of deviant human being. Even the film title 'Leviathan' and front cover are false misrepresentations. There are only two very short shots of the whale's skeleton and it has nothing to do with the movie. This is the outcome of communist/socialist/progressive governments/societies. If you want to feel bad about everything and everyone watch this movie."
" A monument to corruption
",0.0,-0.812,2019-01-24 00:00:00,8,"There is nothing positive whatsoever in this film. Everything is naked and dreary and hopelessly bleak, and the only possible thing this film could inspire you to would be drinking more vodka. Many bottles are emptied, they drink it every day, they empty glasses in one draught, and they never mix it with water. That's their only pleasure in life, the only thing that provides them with anything other than bleak hopeless misery.It's beautifully made, though, if you like landscapes by the Arctic sea and the ocean roaring for both introduction and finish of the film. The direction and acting is splendid, as Russian films usually are technically perfect, but the total realism is without any spirit at all, except for the spirits they drink. It's a self torture to sit for 140 minutes to suffer from a film like this, constantly going from bad to worse, so the one thing you are sure of, when it is finished, is that you will never see it again, which is a relief."
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.8591,2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,I will not go into many details here. A great and impressive movie about humanity at a certain point in time in some particular circumstances. I would not see it neccessarily as a portrait of modern Russia more as of a portrait of a simple life faced with the complexity of a system that overpowers you.
" Desperation and injustice on Russian Northwest
",-0.7717,0.9941,2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,"Leviathan is one special piece of cinema. It is definetely not for everyone, if you are looking just for fun entertainment and light hearted hollywood ending this is not for you, if you are enjoying cold, atmospheric and pessimistic movies Leviathan is definetely for you. Leviathan is directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev one the Russia's most talented directors and with Leviathan he shows that he is one of the most talented and interesting directors not only in Russia, but in the world. Before Leviathan from Zvyagintsev i have just watched The Return, it was okay movie for me, especially enjoyed the landscapes of Northwest Murmansk region and atmosphere but something was missing. Leviathan is also happening in the region mentioned above, but it is more complex and more social themed oriented. In Leviathan Zvyagintsev shows all the bad things happening in Russia and it is totally realistic, ultra realistic, so much that reminded me on the situation in my home country. It seems that is case in all East European countries, but in Russia that corruption and unfairness is on the highest level. Local politicans and mayors of bleak and criminal past, corrupted justice system, corrupted police. As a result of all that, ordinary citizens don't have any hope, and from desperation they are drinking and drinking too much, and family starts to broke up. The atmosphere in the movie is cold, dark, brooding, disturbing but at the same time meditative, atmospheric and thought provoking. Landscapes of Russian Northwest are just breathaking and camera work is just insanely good, i like the slowness/minimalist approach of the movie so you can enjoy feel the atmosphere even more. There is no much music in the movie, only two themes taken from legendary minimalist composer Philipp Glass but they are going so well with the movie that is just fantastic. Acting in the movie is extraordinary but i was most amazed by Roman Madyanov who is acting the main villain, the corrupted mayor, he is so good and real in that role, also his look is so good for the role, he is really looking like all of this fat corrupted ""businessmans"" with round heads you can see driving big Jeeps. This movie totally left me speachless after watch, i was amazed and disturbed at the same time, ending at the church is one of the best endings i have ever seen. A must see for all lovers of the true cinema. Leviathan will be future classic, and Zvyagintsev admired one day like Tarkovsky. I gave 10/10."

" A bit too slow and predictable
",0.0,0.8131,2018-07-11 00:00:00,6,"Everything than can go wrong in a human's life happens in this movie.
To the point it starts to feel a bit stupid.
Also some scenes drags out too much to the point you ask if it was necessary to have them there.
Also some very weird character choices that makes you wonder. 
But it had very good acting and interesting story and characters. 
So I would recommend watching it."
" Nice Views
",0.4215,0.8411,2018-05-30 00:00:00,5,It's hard to admire a camerawork when it's not relevant to what's happening on a screen. Or to what is really on director's mind. At one point it becomes clear: he's searching for a recepie of international success while putting together the images. Which is OK since Hollywood has promoted this type of cinema. The issue I'm having with Zvyagintsev style is that he pretends to be something bigger than just another widely-recognized movie entrepreneur. I wish him good luck but I'm not in his fan club ))
" Life Corrupted
",0.0,0.7269,2018-04-07 00:00:00,9,It's amazing how Zvyagintsev tells a story and fills the background with so many details of the Russian system that the narrative brilliantly combines both aspects in a compelling way. In a way a retelling of the story of Job from Bible but more about how deceptive it is in giving a happy ending and being blind. The film may be thought as pessimistic but I feel it's nothing more than realistic. The system ie both the state and the religion are failing in corruption and the rest can only hope to live without involving in anything.
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.8979,2018-02-21 00:00:00,9,"Brilliant film that discretely depicts the hypocrisy and nonsense of the church and faith, corruption and power inequality. The ones in power always win in the courts. This film is one of the few films I've watched lately that made me feel amazed by it's end."
" The title says it all: Leviathan.
",0.0,0.9097,2018-01-30 00:00:00,8,"In Russian style, the story challenges constructs of modern society. In this case, social contract theory is under attack showing how governments can easily become a vehicle of corruption, thereby destroying more liberty than it serves to protect. Along the way, the story provides stunning backdrop of Russian landscapes and a positively warming depiction of Russian culture and it's people. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
" this is really not what you expect-not an artwork, more like joke
",0.6453,-0.8926,2017-11-18 00:00:00,3,"When you want to describe Russians, as the westerners see them, then you add Vodka in the movie (whole the time), show it as a rough and wild open space with poverty on every step and nowadays many of the self-proclaimed artist use a church as a starting point for spitting. And, not to forget Pussy Riot and Putin, they should be put somewhere too. That is the point of this movie, to make a sad story about small man fighting politics and money, and church, betrayed from everyone. And you add some symbolism to look more artistic, but symbolism is always bad when it is direct (Putin on the poster in every office and in the shooting practice party...) Today, propaganda is implemented in every movie, and this one is full of it. It should receive Nobel price for it, but you don't need to watch this garbage when there are much better movies."
" Life in the wild north
",0.0,0.8951,2017-11-08 00:00:00,10,"Set on Russia's remote but surprisingly beautiful Barents coast, Andrey Zvyagintsev's film 'Leviathan' tells a simple, harsh story of a man who stands to lose everything when he runs foul of the local mayor. Zvyagintsev's 'The Return' is one of my favourite films, but his follow-up 'Elena' disappointed me, being not only depressing but also oddly uneven in tone, mostly flat but with a near-apocalyptic ending. 'Leviathan', however, is a return to form, the director watches the lives of his characters without unnecessary judgement or indulgence in a way that reminds me of early Kieslowski. The brilliant ending at first seems to be making an obvious point, but in fact delivers a final knife to the guts. In an earlier scene, the characters go shooting using targets of past Russian presidents, and comment that it's too soon to view the rule of the current one in his historical perspective. This brilliant film suggests otherwise."
" The title of the movie refers to Thomas Hobbes seminal work 'Leviathan', a political philosophy work about the nature and conditions of liberty and the nation-state.
",0.5267,-0.9231,2017-06-26 00:00:00,9,"Andrey Zvyagintsev's movie Leviathan (2014) is inspired by a true story that took place in the USA, the director however decided to shoot the movie in Russian in order to depict the conditions of Russians under a corrupt bureaucratic oligarchy. The movie suggests that the conditions of living under a corrupt leadership system isn't unique to one Nation and hence Leviathan intends to be a universal parable about a rigged and corrupt capitalist political system in our modern contemporary society.The title of the movie refers to Thomas Hobbes seminal work Leviathan, a political philosophy work about the nature of liberty and the nation-state. Hobbes argue in his work that there is a need for a sovereign power that should rule instead of humanity being in a state of nature. Since Human beings are political animals and that antagonism is inherent in them, then for stability and avoidance of anarchy they need to surrender their powers and right to a sovereign institution. As its evident in the movie, Hobbes didn't anticipated that the sovereign will be brutal and corrupt to this extent. Modernity's Sovereign institution- the nation state- is run by 'figures' that dwell in a state of Nature. The protagonist Kolya is a hotheaded and rude car mechanic. He lives with his second wife Lilya and a teenage son named Roma from his first marriage.Lilya is a depressed and trouble young beautiful woman and Roma loathe her totally. Lilya works in a fish factory where she cleans fish. This simple family living in a small town in the Barents Sea coast are haunted by the town mayor who is an ever drunk and corrupt. Vadim, the town mayor wants to evict the Kolyas from their land by a court order, and it is evident that the court is under Vadim's thumb. Dmitri, as sophisticated handsome lawyer from Moscow comes to help his former friend Kolya. The court rules against the Kolyas and as they report a trespassing case against the mayor, Kolya is arrested. While in jail Lilya and Dmitri have an impromptu sex in hotel and this leads to a crisis in the Kolya family. Kolya's calamities lead to catastrophes, Lilya commits suicide after he threatened her after her relationship with Dmitri. He is finally arrested and jailed. Roma the teenage boy is taken by a family friend. Finally we come to learn that Kolya's jailing was planned by the town mayor who demolishes their house and take the land. Leviathan is a tragic drama that beautifully pulls its viewers to contemplate the subjects of morality and justice in our modern present day. Kolya is a modern day Job- the figure from the old testament fable- who endures the brutality and trials of living under a corrupt judicial and political oligarchy. Kolya's world just like ours is a world governed by arrogant corrupt politician, smart lawyers and corrupt priests. A priest who looks like a character from Dostoyevski films advise Kolya to endure his trials and be patient like Job and submit his affairs to God. Kolya doesn't heed this advice and ends up being the bleached whale – Leviathan-that we see in the dried sea basins and the movie hence evokes both Hobbes Political tract and the old testament's Job.Parliamentary representative democracy failed. The working class is under the gaze of a corrupt politician and a bent judicial system. Modern democracy is hijacked by crony politicians who employ the state institutions to control dissenting voices from the public, Kolya is finally behind bars as we have seen. The judicial system and the prison are used as a control 'mechanism'. The church expects and instills into the public the conformity the state wants. Modernity with all its facets and institutions turned out to benefit the few ruling elites and the subjects of modernity virtually live in a controlled society. Leviathan is a critique of the social contract theory that emancipated an absolute sovereign power. Foundational principles like justice, equality and right to own property are no longer sustainable under a modern sovereign power without complying with their rules and needs, and those who dissent are then put under the mercy of a corrupt justice and emergency laws. The state, the Judiciary, the prisons and the church/mosque all cooperate the elites to consolidate power in their hands."

" Beautiful drama about despair in contemporary Russia
",0.3818,0.9294,2017-04-12 00:00:00,10,"Spoiler Alert!Leviathan is a 2014 drama directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev, the movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture in Foreign Language. The film tells the story of a confrontation between ordinary men Kolya and the corrupt mayor Vadim. Mayor wants to expropriate the land where Kolya's house is built, Kolya believes that the mayor will use this land for his own purpose and fight for the right to deny the expropriation. The setting of the film is the fictional town of Pribrezhniy, we understand that the city is small and that nothing extraordinary is happening there. The town also is not different from the other small town in Russia. It feels like the director is telling to the viewer that similar story could have happened in any Russian town. The film is an open critique of the corrupted governmental and local officials. This could be surprising because the film is made with the help of Russian ministry of culture. Yet, Leviathan brings up the themes that are not discussed explicitly in the Russian society. The film not only shows the issue of the corruption and the morality of the official's deeds, it also shows that the vulnerability of the officials and the inside hierarchy. For example, Dmitrii (the lawyer from Moscow) threaten Vadim with a compromising evidence. Therefore, we see that there is inside hierarchy and the official from Moscow stand above the ones in a smaller town of Russia and that they have the tools to replace them. Vadim's anxiety after Dmitrii threats supports this claim. The movie shows that all of the officials are interconnected in all of the affairs: when the mayor position is threatened, the other officials feel that they might lose their positions as well, so they start to act to support themselves and the corrupted mayor. It is interesting that film proposes that the ordinary people of Pribrezhniy are also complicit in the entire situation. They are complicit because of their ignorance and passivity. We see people who take of Roma at the end, they are not bad people and they decided to help the boy. Yet, they are not ready to act against the officials. Furthermore, they do not see beyond the facts that are presented to them, thus we can say that they ignore the issue and the actual truth. At the same time, Zvyagintsev shows that even intelligentsia is not ready to be active. Dmitrii as a part of the intelligentsia is fully aware of the situation, however, when the threats are starting to be about his private life he decided to flee and not to help. All of this creates the atmosphere of despair. Kolya is not able to protect this house and the citizen themselves are not able to oppose the government – Leviathan. As in the biblical text, the people are not able to fight with this creature and in a Hobbesian term, they give up all of their freedom and their rights. Therefore, the film shows this despair and how ordinary people are unable to fight the government. The film ends in the same manner as it started with the nature sequence. However, the end of the film is happening during the winter time. And we see same shots as in the beginning, but the river and everything is frozen there. This demonstrates the stagnation, and that after the Kolya's case this despair even strengthened. Yet, the very last shot of the film shows the strong sea that is not frozen and this might illustrate the hope that is present in Russian society."
" It can happen to you
",0.0,-0.9735,2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"It would be easy to say that Leviathan is a cruel depiction of the current state of affairs in Russia, that long time enemy we love to hate. But what we see here -abuse of power, cruelty, greed- is sadly universal and would be equally in place in Rwanda, Bolivia or Iowa.What strikes us as foreign is the steady descent into bleakness -poor Kolya seems doomed from the start and indeed the events throughout the movie keeps dragging him deeper and deeper- as opposed to the magic twist into a happy ending, or at least a glimmer of hope, Hollywood style.Leviathan does not offer a solution to end with authoritarian tyrants, and that makes it a better movie. If a solution even exists, we the viewers need to think it over and come up with our own answers. Superheroes are pretty hard to find."
" Fear and loathing in Russia
",-0.7845,0.9739,2017-02-13 00:00:00,10,"It is said that the horror movie genre was invented in the US during the Great Depression. That people needed something scary to get distracted from their own harsh realities, even if just for an hour or two, and maybe even get the feeling that their lives aren't that bad after all.Andrey Zvyagintsev reinvented the concept of horror movies. He basically replaced the screen with a glass wall, so that the audience could see... their own lives, devoid of any fake prettification. And, in fact, his films are way scarier than any, even the most brutal and gory horror film Hollywood could come up with.You probably ought to live here to be able to see it like that though. Not just visit, but actually be an integral part of this Russia. Russia without god, without truth and without hope. Russia that holds you from the day you were born and suffocates you throughout your life. Russia that only a marginal number of its citizens gets to escape. And this Russia is real, no matter how much the majority of my compatriots try to believe otherwise.But even if you are lucky enough to be living in a more hope-filled place, watching Leviathan could still be of some use. So that you could see what we are as a country and as a nation. Beautiful as the hills and mountains and bays of our Far East, cold as a breeze over the wasteland, and utterly lost in space and time like that ever-leaden sea. You could see people, living their lives one day at a time and having no hope neither for tomorrow nor for the rest of the time ahead, drowning their angers and sorrows and basically a total absence of anything really bright in alcoholic drowsiness and silent self-loathing that follows. People who once were born beautiful, just like the rest of the humankind, but whose sparks had long been put out and smothered by not even a darkness but a neverending fog of life with no meaning or goal. That's the real fifty shades of grey, people, and this time there's nothing sexy or fun about it.Of course, it's not always horrendous out here, otherwise all of us would have slit our wrists centuries ago. The sun still shines from time to time, the nature is still mostly uncorrupted and instilling liveliness, people still manage to love each other, even when the life is hard. But, come think of it, even in the brightest and the most poverty-protected places of this country you still could feel living under a huge dome. Because the system, one that's been around long before Putin came to power and stemming from the very essence of our people, makes sure that you're never fully in charge of your life. Small or big, we are still puppets in someone else's hands. The only difference is that some have absolute pigs as their masters, never shy to show around who's the boss, and some are given a dose of illusion that they actually have freedom here and that god is their only judge. But even if god ever existed, he's long forsaken this desolate place, and all the freedom left is still bound by the invisible glass walls, walls one of which Andrey Zvyagintsev has used so artfully."
