" Families can be boring .... or that !!
",-0.4374,0.9646,2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,"I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. A beautiful cast that blends to form this -definitely interesting- family with a lovely mix of love and tension that is well built based on their backgrounds.
It delivers the message that nobody's perfect and that life goes on no matter what.
I dont think Adam driver was the best for this role, but everybody else were just so lovely and made you feel you were part of the family."
" Better than expected.
",0.4404,0.8591,2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"This film was great, it portrays a family that fits the category of ""dysfunctional"", but that also shows how complicated human relationships actually are. It's low-key dramatic and has its funny moments; the all-American drama with all the key ingredients for a ""it's gonna be okay"" feeling in the end."
" zzzz

" Regular...
",0.0,0.9344,2021-02-13 00:00:00,6,"Slow, with a few comic situations in the family (the poop and the little boy scene was iconic), a little touching drama, tasteless fights, good actors in a not-so-good work, unbalanced, not moved, not entertained, not amused, regular to boring, but the outcome was cute, exciting and fun ..."
" Warm and real movie

" Blood sucking tick
",0.0,0.3876,2021-01-08 00:00:00,3,"The beginning of this movie is amazing. The first 20-30 minutes is some fine quality cinema.But post that it takes a sharp plunge. And if you force yourself to keep watching it, you will realise your blood and peace being drained. It transforms into a completely different movie, which is advisable you stay away from.It becomes so monotonous and boring it will put you at unease!"
" Tina Fey sucks
",-0.3612,-0.6591,2021-01-02 00:00:00,6,"The film is good, star-studded, jason bateman is amazing as per usual in doing both drama and dry comedy. Adam driver is so fresh. Janr Fonda is, well Jane Fonda. But Tina Fey is really bad at drama, really bad at crying. She can't cry, she doesn't know how, and she shouldn't even bother."
" A Likable Dramedy
",0.0,0.8594,2020-11-16 00:00:00,7,"A death in the family reunites four siblings for a week. In that time, their interactions demonstrate that life is not simple. In fact, they are confronted with most of the occurrences that complicate life: divorce, pregnancy, affairs, love and death. Each of them must refine his understanding of happiness.The central character is played by Jason Bateman. He is surrounded by a strong cast. My favorite performance is by Tina Fey, who commands every scene she is in.As in life, the plot does not resolve into easy, happy solutions. Each character must deal with real issues---or not----and sometimes they are not masters of their own fates. The film never settles for the maudlin, and does a good job of balancing comedy and drama"
" Worth watching once but nothing not seen before
",0.1154,0.9916,2020-11-03 00:00:00,7,"This is a well made movie. Very good acting & direction, but for older movie viewers who have seen movies very much like this before it is just a nice one time watch.
It has a good storyline & for a younger audience who have not had the opportunity to see a good movie about a family dealing with loss, love & being grateful for what you do already have in life, then this is a good moving to watch & be inspired by.
I've probably seen like 20+ well made movies that cover all these things though so that is why I will give it a good score of 7 out of 10 ( as lack of real originality here )."
" Fantastic film once you've matured a bit
",0.5574,0.9125,2020-10-18 00:00:00,9,"I watched this film when it first came out when I was in my mid-twenties. I was drawn to it as many actors in the film are personal favourites. It fell pretty flat. I didn't hate it by any means, but there was a sense of ambivalence. Fast forward five years to me being 31 and having suffered the loss of my grandfather with a dysfunctional extended family thrown in and this film just hit different to the first viewing. For those saying it's unrealistic, I dare say you likely have functional families and/or haven't lost either the patriarch or matriarch of your family, because this movie is spot on - at least in my experience. If you like adam sander or will ferrell, this movie isn't for you, but if you want something heartfelt and real, this movie is fantastic. Probably not for anyone younger than 30."
" Great ensemble cast
",0.6249,0.8883,2020-10-02 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this film about a family coming together to mourn their father. Heartwarming and funny, they make a believable family and all the performances are excellent."
" I cried watching a comedy
",-0.0258,0.9078,2020-09-30 00:00:00,10,"I usually don't leave review but for this movie I really want to write something. Hate to admit it, but I cried in the movie theatre at the end of this movie, granted there were only a couple of patrons at the theatre on a Tuesday night, I still remember walking out the theatre tears rolling down my cheeks.
Without spoiling the movie for you, I'll say this. This is not just a drama romcom about a dysfunctional family, there's siblings bonds, father and son memories... Love your family but still recognise the pain of spending all the time together sitting 'shiva'.
Everytime I tell anyone this is my favourite movie of all time and they judge me for liking this, i was like ""well, this is where I leave you""
Hope you'll enjoy ðŸ˜‰"
" Underrated and beautifully acted
",0.5719,0.8291,2020-08-07 00:00:00,8,"My wife and I just watched this for the second time. The first time we saw it, it didn't resonate with us. This time, I think with our having experienced more of life and being in a different headspace and place in our lives, we loved it. The actors are great and the relationships are highly relatable. I don't think I would have liked it as much in my twenties, as my life experience was so much less, but being in my late forties, and having experienced much of what goes on in the movie, I really enjoyed it. No matter what age you are, give it a watch and see where you are in your life."
" What a waste of a good cast
",0.0258,0.3869,2020-07-17 00:00:00,4,"Based on the list of actors involved like Fonda, Driver and Bateman, and the good reviews (no doubt added by friends and family) I gave this a try. Not a good decision. It plods along not knowing whether to be a comedy or a tragedy and widely missing the mark on both keveks. The script is dire with constant remarks about Jane Fonda's boob job and ogling of the results by her sons. When you think of Adam Driver in the wonderful Marriage Story you wonder why he ended up in this sorry mess."
" Truthful and poignant
",0.4588,0.6234,2020-07-15 00:00:00,8,"I watched this film shortly after my mother died. Not because it was about a family going through grief but because I was watching everything I could with Adam Driver in. What it gave me was unexpected. Yes I got Adam, and I enjoyed that element but it gave me far more. I found it funny, I found moments sad and poignant but ultimately it spoke to me. The way I felt about death, immediately after was reflected in so many moments. It made me feel better and it still does every time I feel a little low about life it makes me feel better. There is so much to take away from it and for all it's faults I take that from it.
I liked it, it's not perfect but I liked it."

",-0.4588,-0.6483,2020-07-06 00:00:00,1,"Boring, not funny, tries way to hard. Waste of good actors! Absolute rubbish"
" Jason Bateman
",0.0,0.9403,2020-07-04 00:00:00,7,I'm no movie critic or film analyst but i do believe Jason Bateman is one of the best actors going around today. His ability to balance the serious and the comedic is genius level. The movie itself was good. I don't normally watch these types of movies but with COVID i think I've watched ever bloody movie ever made and this one was next cab off the rank. I'm glad i watched it.
" Above average!
",0.0,0.9464,2020-06-21 00:00:00,7,"As far as watching chick flicks goes, this wasn't too bad.
Good humour and interesting characters. It's funny seeing Adam Driver play quite a different role to Kylo Ren and his Marriage Story character. Jason Bateman is a good lead character and glues all these extras together. A good way to fill in a night."
" Jason Bateman is the only good thing
",0.4404,0.7703,2020-06-18 00:00:00,2,"So many talented actors in a cliche ridden movie, either they were paid a lot of money or they're friends of the director."
" Unfunny, boring and pointless movie
",-0.3182,0.2263,2020-04-25 00:00:00,1,"I expect this from Jane Fonda but it's disappointing to see Adam Driver and Jason Bateman play in this joke of a movie. I feel ashamed to say that I have watched this film.
One star is too generous."
" This Is Where I Leave You left me wanting more laughs and less destructive drama.
",-0.1063,0.8124,2020-04-17 00:00:00,5,"Grieving is always a solemn time for solace and melancholy. To reflect upon the life that has departed, recounting the flourishing memories shared with them. A chance for fragmented families to rejoin as a unit once more, offering emotional support for one another. Well, for the Altmans, whose patriarchal father had sadly passed away, that's not the case. A boisterous family consisting of four siblings whom each inhibit their own overbearing issues. There's Judd whom recently witnessed his wife cheat on him with his loud-mouthed ever-growing heterosexual boss, only to then reconcile with his high school friend who was incidentally madly in love with him. Wendy, being married to a workaholic, rekindles a burning flame with her childhood friendly neighbour. Paul whom is unable to provide his wife Annie with a child due to infertility, despite trying repeatedly during the seven days of shiva that their father supposedly demanded. And finally Phillip, the man-child playboy entrepreneur of the family. Rather predictably, being confined to their mother's home for seven days produced bickering, brawls and bail outs between the self-destructive siblings, whom all seemingly yearn to make their lives even more complicated.Levy's ""dramedy"" is equipped with an outstandingly talented cast of both comedy and dramatic prowess, yet frustratingly strolls along at a pedestrian pace. Driver, Bateman, Fey, Byrne, Stoll, Olyphant and even Fonda all in the same feature? That's madness! Unsurprisingly, they all supply compelling performances that bring joyous life into their characters, with Fey offering a career-best presentation that balances emotional complexity with comedic execution.However, Tropper's screenplay, for which he adapted his own book, generally painted unlikeable characters. Family members who would make the very worst relationship decisions, by seemingly committing adultery with every member of their neighbourhood in the space of seven days, that makes them no better morally than Judd's counterpart for example. It's careless characterisation that only had one purpose, to create drama. Whilst it does provide a development strand for adult responsibilities, it does so through a predictable mesh of sub-plots. Certain characters, notably Olyphant's Horry, were underused and acted as mere plot devices. The forced and absolutely unnecessary climactic lesbian revelation was, well, pointless to say the least. Again, supplying the narrative with this abhorrent self-destructive force within these supposedly married couples, culminating into reconciling acceptance.And finally, the obvious flaw, Levy was unable to blend weak comedy with overbearing drama effectively. The poignant moments of reflection produced the largest impact and certainly had its moments. The comedy however? Non-existent. Mostly relying upon profanity and phallic jokes. It's a dire shame that the screenplay reduced the onscreen performances to predictable belligerents.Whilst the end product is an easy and watchable feature, the pedestrian pace and lack of morality certainly left me with no impression. Olyphant and Driver though! Phwoar..."
" Netflix got me here in quarantine
",0.0,0.4996,2020-04-16 00:00:00,9,"I liked the movie because right now, life feels so hard and there goes this guy, life happens and gets in his way, if he could survive, sure I will too."
" 2014 what a year
",0.0,0.9887,2020-04-04 00:00:00,10,This movie came out right after I found out my own wife was cheating on me. It actually saved me. I went and saw this in the theater every night for 30 days. I felt it spoke to me. Living in Florida but being from Maine so the drive at the end meant something to me. It's a great gem of a movie. The acting is superb and I felt like they were all actual family and real friends. Definitely one to watch. I hope this helped you as much as it helped me. I also hope you will find this movie as entertaining and heartwarming and heartbreaking as I did.
" Such a underrated movie!
",0.0,0.8271,2020-02-08 00:00:00,9,"Love this, hilarious in a clever way, great acting (actors) and pretty emotional at times. Only a few cheesy lines that could have been avoided, but all in all wow:)One of my favs."

" Well worth watching
",0.4588,0.907,2019-08-16 00:00:00,9,"With lesser talents it would be a lesser film. But the casting makes a film that might seem saccharine into a very enjoyable piece of entertainment. Neither a simple romcom nor a heavyweight Bergmanesque family drama, a bit of both worth a watch."
" Family Angst
",0.0,0.296,2019-07-10 00:00:00,7,Call me simple but I found this movie to be a funny and moving story based on a dysfunctional family forced to reconnect when dad dies. Maybe it's a little formulaic but the ride was worth my time.

",0.6369,0.9608,2019-06-27 00:00:00,9,"Never get tired of watching it - every time finding something new. Adam Driver is hilarious, everyone seems perfect for their roles. Jason Bateman just keeps continuing to be great in everything he does. Corey Stoll is a bit of a wet blanket but that's who his character is. Great trio of brothers here. The story does a full circle - kids who don't want to be there, have trouble remembering any good times with their deceased dad eventually acknowledge their mom was right - they all needed to be together for this time, this event. Loved this family and the story and the way it's written."

" Great Film; Inexplicably Under The Radar
",0.6249,0.9587,2019-04-24 00:00:00,9,"In a day and age when the mere presence of a single great actor seems to trigger positive reviews from their sycophants, it's amazing that this star-studded cast hasn't elevated ""This Is Where I Leave You"" to critically bulletproof status.It's a bit inexplicable, as there's something for everyone beyond the generational casting feat itself. It's intelligently funny as hell. Every familial character has an individually compelling storyline that seamlessly weaves itself into the story of the collective family itself. And because of the diversity of character sketches, one would think the film would have an appeal that reached out to almost everyone within the American family demographic.Yet despite all that, the film got traction, but didn't get entrenched. What a shame, as it's Really Rather Wonderful. Will streaming allow ""This Is Where I Leave You"" to become a residual classic over time? It could happen. There are certainly less deserving films. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, please click ""Helpful."" Cheers!)"

" a beautiful, well-crafted film with powerhouse performances
",0.5994,0.9559,2019-03-22 00:00:00,7,"A sharp, engaging, and emotionally lively comic drama, This Is Where I Leave You blends cynicism with warmth for something that manages to put forth a mirthful edge and a bittersweet lilt. Entertaining and ideally cast, the film is a sometimes subdued, sometimes joyous look at grownup scrapes and lessons learned."

" A deep comedy
",0.3612,0.639,2019-02-02 00:00:00,6,This comedy film has some very serious undertones. The film was good not amazing and it's not one that I would rush back to watch but it was a good movie to have watched
" Lousy.
",-0.5423,-0.7814,2019-01-14 00:00:00,3,I suffered through the unnecessary expletives because I genuinely admire the leads but the weed smoking/getting high in a Jewish temple scene as well as the lesbian reveal were both in too poor taste to excuse. Lousy.

" family
",0.0,0.4404,2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,Review: I love this movie because it examines the Jewish form of mourning i.e. sitting shiva. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. The casting and acting are incredible also. Jane Fonda steals the show as this very complex and complicated matriarch. The basis of this story is love conquers all and family is forever. The altman's are extremely complicated people thrown together in this very bleak and comical scenario for 7 days. Watching this period it is clear that they are dysfunctional but also relatable to others when someone dies and everyone has to get together. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" TIME AFTER TIME
",0.0,0.2492,2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,"The family gathers for a funeral and spend time together after the death of their father not in August Osage County. The film centers around Judd (Jason Bateman) the second oldest son and the most stable in the group. Recently he has split up with his wife (Abigail Spencer) when he caught her in bed with his boss (Dax Shepard). His sister Wendy (Tina Fey) is his confidant, although secrets burn inside of her. She has her own issues.Paul (Corey Stoll) is the oldest. He believes the family business should go to him. His wife Alice (Kathryn Hahn) was Judd's girlfriend for 6 months before he met Quinn.Phillip (Adam Driver) is the baby in the group. He hasn't grown up and brings his much older girlfriend Tracy (Connie Britton) who is also his analyst.Mom (Jane Fonda) Loves to talk about her dead husband's sexual ability and shows off her cleavage to the dismay of her family. She has also written a book ""Cradle to All"" based on the personal lives of her children.The film is a light situation comedy with family drama and secrets but without the intensity. On some level it feels like a romantic comedy. The family comes together to form new bonds and more understanding relationships, even those they know are doomed for failure.Parental Guide: F-bomb.

Every single character in the film is well cast and perfectly played. The actors skillfully bring the characters from the book to life on the big screen. When you turn a book into a movie (or any source material) you have to stay as true to the source material (if it's well done) as possible. The actors and director did that here.

The siblings squabble and barb to great comedic affect.
The characters were engaging and quite often charming.
There is a lot of great talent here.
I was most surprised by Tina Fey who was so great that I now struggle to disengage her performance from her real life.Now this film probably does tug at one too many heart strings and near the end it does get a bit ""Dawson's Creek"" but I didn't mind for a minute.This is not laugh-out-loud but is a great, simple story; heart warming, humorous and very enjoyable."
" Made Me Laugh Out Loud a Couple Times and That's Hard to Do

Dad was a stoner?
No, it was probably medicinal.
It always is.""Classic. I remember in high school finding joints of the best Thai weed when I tried on my older brother's sport coat at his house in Hawaii. Classic. I was so rooting for a miscarriage. I honestly thing the world would be a better place if there were a lot more of those and a lot fewer accidental pregnancies, but I guess that I'm just a romantic at heart."
" It's OK, but has not particular point or purpose
",0.2421,0.9813,2018-04-26 00:00:00,6,"The thing is, while it is funny and somewhat interesting, it deals with serious things, yet provides no particular insight or point and serves no particular purpose. Sure, the father died and a large and somewhat-dysfunctional family is trying to cope with it. That is portrayed OK and from a funny angle, which is good to take your mind of the sad event. But, it would have been much better had it tried to go somewhere with all this, apart from the silly cliche of ""don't play it safe, take a chance"" for our somewhat-main protagonist (played by Jason Bateman).As-is, it is a look of a particular family and how it deals with its first tragic event. Which is fine, but, there are many families and they deal with this stuff in many ways, we never quite find out what's so special about this one that we should care much.Even the extended cameo of Blah-Blah of HIMYM fame (Abigail Spencer) doesn't really work towards providing much point to all of this.All that being said, it's OK and worth a watch, it's just that it feels like it could have been much better."
" Solid family-based comedy/drama
",0.1531,0.9913,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'This Is Where I Leave You' is a good mix of funny moments and dramatic moments of reflection. It's basically the story of four siblings - Judd (Bateman), Wendy (Fey), Phillip (Driver) & Paul (Stoll) - and how they, along with their mum (Fonda), deal with their father's death. There's lots of squabbling and jibes, but also some nice scenes with some emotional depth.This film is slightly better than 'Date Night', Levy's similar film from a few years ago with Fey. It's not too long, is quite well paced and has a good soundtrack. My main gripe is that - since I can relate! - there wasn't a more fleshed-out character for Paul, the big brother. I think Phillip comes off being the most interesting, but it's enjoyable seeing how they all interact with each other & their sibling's partners. No real conclusion, but there is a few unnecessary spanners thrown in the works at the end.The best bits are when they all deal with the loss with some levity, especially aided by ""Boner"" the Rabbi (Schwartz), some of Fey's quips and the toilet-training kid. Byrne's good as Bateman's love interest, but since there's so many cast members, doesn't get enough screen time, along with Fonda."
" Bateman Carries
",0.0,0.9901,2017-10-23 00:00:00,7,"Yes Jason Bateman plays the same kind of guy in most of his work, and it may even be close to his real personality. But either way, there is something likable about that guy. I don't if it's acting or what, but he's great. Without him, I would not have watched this.Regarding the Jewish aspect. They say up front that the mom is not Jewish (meaning I assume that she didn't even convert), and the dad is an atheist.So these people are secular, born to a non-Jewish woman, but with apparently some loose ""Reform"" Jewish identity. Let's not say that they are typical Jews. Even most of the actors were non-Jewish. Having said that, it presents a horrible family and makes them seem Jewish. So be prepared for that if it's bothersome.But there's more to that. Clearly these people are living Godless lives and never fully understand the relationship between that fact, and their disappointments. (That is probably true for the film makers, or people in Hollywood in general) Yet, I don't know if it was intentional or not, but the writer used the vehicle of religious ritual (sitting together for a week to mourn a loved one)as a means toward some spiritual or moral reckoning, and that seems to be a pro-religion statement.The Bateman character lacks ""alpha"" qualities. That's probably why his wife went with an alpha male, and why he never really lived his life to the fullest. They don't identify this by name, but it's really one of the core themes affecting millions of men around the globe. Beta males live in the shadow of alphas.The house and town looked lovely. Why does everyone talk about who ""got out?"" I guess elitist types view their hometowns as provincial and silly.Tina Fey was good. She was down-to-earth and didn't ham it up. Forget the device of having a kid sitting on a portable toilet. That's such a cheap way to get a laugh. Wouldn't the kid need toilet paper anyways? That whole story line cheapened the experience.I realize that we are living in a ""progressive"" age, but I don't know if audiences want to see same-sex kissing, etc. I guess it will become more and more accepted. If you want to imply that same sex people are together, you could just show them gazing into each other's eyes. I guess the whole movement is about making it identical to the straight life. So showing actual gay bed scenes will be next, if it's not already happening.With this many characters and only so much time, it's hard to establish back stories. I think they did a reasonably decent job of that. Also, as others have said, they walked that fine line between slapstick and drama well."
" Not an ideal scenario of how relationship should work.
",-0.4168,0.7269,2017-10-13 00:00:00,4,"As you all know I share ratings with following sequence: rating = number of stars, 6=1(poor), 7=2(average), 8=3(good), 9=4(very good), and 10=5(excellent). Now I will tell you why I have been rated this as poor.The movie portrays a story where a person temporarily gets into relationship only to forgive a member in his past that got into relationship with somebody else. Further the old couple would again get into relationship after everything clears. Ideally this makes the story weak. Only psychiatrists would know if it would work. Ideally the past companion is to be forgiven without making any blundered choices. Thus I rate the movie as poor."
" Typical Dysfunctional Family Movie
",0.0,0.9753,2017-09-28 00:00:00,6,"Jane Fonda's husband has died, and her four children return home for the funeral. The oldest son, Corey Stall, has marital troubles with his wife, Kathryn Hahn, who used to be his younger brother's girlfriend. Jason Bateman, just found out his wife cheated on him, and he seeks to numb his heartache with Rose Byrne, a friend from high school. Tina Fey's husband ignores her and works too much, and she has an emotionally complex history with the neighbor, Timothy Olyphant. And the problemed child, Adam Driver, is involved with an older woman, Connie Britton. With all the children's problems, is there any room for Jane Fonda? Yes, there is. She, just like her children, has problems and secrets that are bound to come out over the weekend.I'm sure every viewer will take his own opinion of the film, but I was pretty split down the middle. Jason Bateman's storyline takes the lead, and it was my worst part of the film. Rose Byrne was wholly unlikable, and I wished that both she and Jason would have surrendered their screen time to someone else. Adam Driver's part of the plot is much smaller, but it's more interesting. His girlfriend is a therapist, and his character, more than anyone, shows the damage dysfunctional parenting does to children. By far, Tina Fey's segment was my favorite. Yes, she's famous for her comedic talents, but when she tackles a dramatic scene, she's surprisingly talented. The scenes she shares with Timothy Olyphant are very touching.This Is Where I Leave You is a very typical dysfunctional family film, so if you don't like those types of movies, you're not going to like this one. I watched it because I like Jane Fonda, but it's not a movie I'll probably want to rent again.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some adult content, I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie."
" Hard Hitting Hilarity,
",-0.1027,0.9976,2017-06-13 00:00:00,8,"This Is Where I Leave You is a great movie with a well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It deals with a lot of serious, somewhat distressing family issues, each character and individual story is very layered, with many surprises throughout. However, it is also a very funny film, there is s lot of comedic dialogue that lightens the mood and takes us away from the depressing situation these characters are in. I did feel that a lot of the plot lines did not go as far as they could have. For a movie that sets up a tone at the very beginning that it is going to deal with some complicated issues and is not going to be a typical comedy you would see the likes of Jason Bateman and Tina Fey in, it did feel like the writers were playing it safe on certain occasions. They had so many opportunities to really surprise its audience, but instead made mundane decisions. The cast is phenomenal, there is amazing chemistry between each individual member and I was truly convinced this was a family. Bateman is stellar in the lead role, playing a very flawed character whom we do support, and his relationship with his brothers, played by Adam Driver and Corey Stoll, is my favourite part of the movie. They had a great back and forth with one another that was very real. Tina Fey also shines in one of her most dramatic roles today, and Rosa Byrne had great presence as Penny Moore, having some beautiful dialogue with Bateman. It is a heavy movie that also had me in stitches at times. Very funny and well acted, I would certainly recommend This Is Where I Leave You to anyone looking for a good comedy drama. A week long mourning period begins to take its toll on four siblings when they return to their family home. Best Performance: Jason Bateman"
" Go For It and You'll forget You just watched 6.6 rated movie
",-0.2263,0.9681,2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"The actual factor any audience wants in a perfect movie is its ability to hold them from the very beginning. Either it be the modern society clichÃ© or be the long lasting parenting this movie excels in every part. Gearing for the dad's funeral and reuniting the emotions certainly entertained me. The cast is flawless and I found every part should be clearly praised. This will certainly boost up for some family golden moments. The brothers and their differences, the eldest one being not so funny and the youngest one being the most naughty is what we all expect from the family pack, but the arrangements of their characters and the way they are presented will not leave you being bored at any instance. It has done a decent job in handling the old days, old days link-ups and has exactly shown their effects in the future when actually you need those to be back again. But I laughed hard in some scenes of Church or even more. So, the perfect blend of emotions, comedy, reality inside the family makes this movie a must watch."
" oh my god i hate this movie
",-0.3818,-0.9918,2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"ugh what a horrible film.i still have 20 minutes to go on this movie but good lord i despise it utterly. the script is glib and sanctimonious, and the characters are clichÃ©d. worse, they are so obnoxious that they are insufferable to watch. everyone behaves inappropriately, all the time. this film is meant to be about the journey of bereavement, but any sense of grief is lost in the shallow wisecracks. lying, violence, belittling and adultery is treated as no big deal either, which i found a real turn off. a horrible misfire. avoid."
