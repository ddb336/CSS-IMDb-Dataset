" Poignant, sultry character analysis
",0.0,0.9381,2020-08-06 00:00:00,8,"I think a lot of people were either mislead by the glitz and glamour of its star-couple, or decided they hated this right off the bat *because* of them, but in any case, By the Sea is not what I expected it to be. My advice when you decide to watch this film: surrender to it.
Accept that this is a slow-moving character piece devoid of spectacle and shock value. Rather, it is a very intimate and accurate portrayal of two peolple torn apart by heartache, but choosing to stay together nonetheless.The performances by both Pitt and Jolie are admirable. I was especially fascinated with Pitt, his Roland being a character who shows nothing but patience, restraint and loyalty for his destructive wife. He had me constantly guessing as to his motivation and willingness to stay with her, though in the end it becomes plainly clear: love. He loves her, in spite of everything. Jolie, on her part, does a very commendable job in her painfully accurate portrayal of grief and depression, on an unrelenting path to destruction. Her Vanessa is an intriguing character to observe; all at once beautiful, sad, destructive, pathetic, vulnerable and charismatic. It is, in fact, very true to what depression actually is.
In terms of atmosphere, By the Sea is heavy, slow, sensual, sweaty almost... The entire film feels exactly like the setting it's placed in: a hot, clammy summer in the south of France, where everything just sticks to your skin and there's no escaping no matter what you try. It's slow-moving yet there is, as is life, always movement. Things are never truly still, especially beneath the surface, as this film so poignantly shows.All in all, I think Jolie did quite an excellent job here with her writing, as well as direction. The cinematography is quite beautiful and the music fits perfectly. It's overall an obvious homage to 60s romantic art cinema, and it works damn well.
More simply put, it's much better than everyone would have you believe, you just have to... surrender."

" Unconvincing Jolie Acting: Convincing Picturesque Cinematography
",0.6486,-0.4458,2020-05-07 00:00:00,5,"(Flash Review)This is a calm and somber tale to arrive at a singular point. Pitt and Jolie play a married couple who spend time in a rustic French resort, by the sea of course, so Pitt can be inspired to write. They have a rickety marriage and Jolie is either depressed or just finds the worst in every situation. There is a young and newly married couple in the room next door and Jolie discovers a peep hole so logically :-) they both begin to take occasional ganders. This 'activity' begins to bring Pitt and Jolie closer together for a change yet she still tries to be emotionally destructive. What is the root cause of her mental agony? Scenes in the film depict different perspectives on marriage at different phases. The cinematography is picturesque yet I don't think Jolie is a very good actress, which hurts the final reveal as it should have had more impact. She lacks nuance and is better suited for fluff action."
" A film of tender, subdued intensity. Intelligently and passionately made. A delight of a film.
",0.8834,0.9674,2020-04-30 00:00:00,9,"Someone said in a review that this movie was of hyper-realism. Within the first 10 minutes, I realised this is exactly what it is. Yet I was not bored for even one minute of the 2 hours. I found myself glued to the beautiful imagery, almost anxious to see what the next exchange would be between the two partners, portrayed by Pitt and Jolie in a subdued, yet intense manner.Most movies, in fast-pacing the flow of life, come to alienate us from our slow experience-from our reality. Distraction and dissatisfaction are the price we pay for entertainment. That's what's appreciated in the film industry these days. This movie doesn't cater to that. It follows moments, expressions, reactions naturally; it connects us with the slow, infinitely subtle nuances of our own lives, emotionally, sensually and so on.All those 1-2 star ratings are given, perhaps, by people who cannot stand to see their all-too-human reality mirrored back to them-pain, envy, trauma-, so they bash the film because they can't stay present to it.There's a feeling of ennui that permeates everything; there's quite an existential feel to it. She is closed off in her own world; he is lost in his. Disconnection, insecurity, jealousy, distrust, even malice born of frustration with oneself, and with one's partner.The cinematography is beautiful; the whole film belongs, as someone else said, on a postcard. The lines are sparse, but they are not cheap. I found the characters to be quite insightful, though not necessarily overly self-conscious. There is perhaps a line or two that feel a little unnatural in the whole movie, but that's it. The rest was hyper-real human interaction.This is a film for those passionate about beautiful cinematography, who seek to connect more deeply with life and its realities-not to escape from it. If you're disconnected from your own experiences, you'll be disconnected from this movie. And if you love to explore all kinds of aspects of the human experience, and of relationships in particular, you'll be grateful this movie exists."

" I Love This Movie
",0.6369,0.8807,2020-02-16 00:00:00,10,"I'm watching this movie for the 2nd time. There's something about seeing Brad and Angelina in a film together. This is no Mr. & Mrs. Smith yet each movie reflects where they were at the time the movie was being made. There was electricity between them in Mr. & Mrs. Smith and in By the Sea, there is struggle which apparently was really happening at the time this film was made.Watching it now in 2020 after they've split up and are yet to be divorced officially and completely, it's sort of a testament to their lives. I think Brad did a better acting job than Jolie did. Her acting seems a bit stilted but she's great to watch just because of her incredible wide eyed features. She is definitely too skinny here also. In M&M Smith, she looked a lot healthier.The other thing about this movie is Malta. Such a beautiful place.Although this movie is about her struggle to come to terms with 2 miscarriages and not being able to concieve, she had said that the movie was about coming to terms with her mom's passing. Then later it was said that this film depicted the struggle going on in their marriage - Brad's drinking which we've learned by his own admission was a problem. I don't know if Angelina is the jealous type but she has few friends it seems and there were rumors to the effect her being a jealous type so there's somewhat of a parallel there.If you've always been a Jolie-Pitt/Brangelina fan, you'll enjoy this movie again and again."

" Since I am European, I sort of liked it
",0.3626,0.9863,2019-10-27 00:00:00,7,"Some of the reviewers dismissed this movie as being too ""European"", which is not really explaining anything. However, I am European and I found it interesting, albeit imperfect.Attractive middle aged couple Jolie and Pitt (Vanessa and Roland), are vacationing in a most beautiful location, allegedly in the south of France. It is actually Gozo and not looking much like southern France (where I spent many summers), but this is irrelevant to the story.The couple is on the rocks, they hardly speak to each other. Roland drinks a lot, Vanessa lounges. A sparkle of life comes with the newlywed couple who takes residence in the adjoining room of their hotel.Vanessa spies the couple through a hole in the wall and soon Roland does it, too. This sort of rekindle their sexual life, but there's a dark secret in Vanessa's life and until she acknowledges it, there is no future for the mature couple.Allegedly a ""vanity"" project, there is also plenty of Jolie on sight. It would have been better is she restrained herself a bit, but we get plenty of her rather large breasts on her very thin body, and close-ups of her weird, taut facial features. Luckily, we also get some Brad Pitt, to balance the Jolie overexposure.The mood and atmosphere are melancholic and hypnotic, probably best understood by a more mature audience who already experienced a slump in their relationships. It definitely seems realistic. However, onscreen fractured relationships are much more appealing than real-life ones, especially when portrayed by attractive people."

You have the two best looking couples in Hollywood, and you couldn't make this movie more interesting? Not to mention sub titles the kiss of death for a movie. I gotta meet the people who were paid to give this movie an 10.
Your life has to be so boring and uninteresting to think this slow movie deserves a rating of a 10. It's so bad you cants even make fun of it. Please give me another Mr. n Mrs. Smith!

It is beautifully shot with great attention to detail, especially regarding the interiors and the fashion.It plays like a subtle, engaging, independent French movie, that, for better or worse, has two Hollywood stars in lead roles. Had it not, I am convinced it would have earned much more positive attention. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt play their roles well, but if you dislike either, it may cloud your judgement and you will not like this film.Watch with a positive mind :)"

" Interesting, but not really coherent
",0.2144,0.8816,2019-06-09 00:00:00,7,"Angelina Jolie wrote the script, and shows that she is more talented than I believed. It was hard at first to watch, because Jolie is rather a strange actress (comparison:. Mia Farrow). She always appears so sullen and lost in her own cloud. I found out during the film that this takes place during the 1970s.A middle aged couple (Pitt and Jolie) stop by a wealthy resort in the Riviera (actually filmed in Malta, however). Pitt befriends an elderly bar tender/restaurant owner who has been through it all, and has found peace in marriage. Jolie's character is sullen and angry. Pitt is jolly and care free, and does not understand her bad mood.It turns out that Pitt's character is a has been writer who drinks a lot. He is frequently down at the bar. Jolie's character, in her paranoid state, starts to believe that Pitt is having an affair with a beautiful young blond American woman next door to their room who has just married a Frenchman.
The couple argues and the woman's mood seems to improve. She discovers a peep hole in the room and starts spying on the couple next door to recapture the young and fun memories of the early state of marriage. Soon her husband finds out and joins in spying on the neighbors. It seems perverted, but it is supposed to represent the passion of newlyweds. Soon, it turns out that all is not well with the younger couple.
It was an interesting movie, reminiscent of the French New Wave films. Psychoanalysis of relationships is not as in vogue as it was forty or fifty years ago. In the end, the couple drives away from the hotel feeling like they have survived another stage of married life. Sadly, that has not appeared to have happened in their real life marriage.
I think the main flaw of this film is Jolie herself. I never quite understand her. She is Moody and rather depressive person in all her roles, and even when she appears in the tabloids. I felt she had something really important to say about marriage and that the romance eventually meets hard reality of the tedium of married life. However, I felt she appears so odd and jaded that she does not seem like she connects with the audience."

Touching the display of so many emotions by Angelina and Brad without overdoing it not even for a second. The story could be acceptable except for the motivation of the main couple crisis. In a story of 2015 is no longer acceptable. Infertility cannot be the reason of the whole drama, since it has been used a innumerable times. It cannot be accepted ad a motive for the death of sex life between Jolie's character and Pitt's character. It seems that she is considering sex for procreation only, which is outlandish. Also, Pitt's character job (the usual american writer with the blank page block and a propension toward finding inspiration in a glass of wine or pastiss, is not particularly original. It is an effort by Angelina Jolie to show all she can do. She should, however, read and watch more good French movies (perhaps some good English movies too) and try to make a better, more interesting and intriguing story. Her great performance, Pitt's good performance and the convincing job of the other actors are not good enough."

Anyway who would want to get to know Angelina and Brad characters in this movie. Both were unlikeable, in particular Angelina. Skeletal Angelina! Also that peephole how the hell did the French couple next door not notice that? Why would you go on holiday to play cards with the foreigners next room?

With him indulging in too much drink and her indulging in too much of absolutely nothing, progress seems to be very poor - at least until a second, younger honeymoon couple arrive at the same hotel.Judged by its indifferent scores and very underwhelming box office take you might dismiss this film as a vanity project hatched by an actress with more money than talent - but that would be very unfair. In Angelina Jolie's Wikipedia page ""episodes of depression"" are mentioned and in this film it seems clear that she's addressing these and other demons from her own past even if the basic plot is fictional. This is not the kind of subject matter suited to an entertaining evening with a romantic dinner or after a curry and a pint (substitute non-UK alternatives here if you wish). This never was a film that was even targeted at big box office.Is it a good depiction of depression? I'm lucky enough not to have personal experience here so I don't know. But I do feel that I learned something and in that Jolie must have succeeded - for that must surely have been her true goal. And I respect her for taking on the challenge.The film isn't perfect though. Even with the chosen subject matter, the pace is sometimes a little slow and the new interest that Vanessa eventually finds and shares with Roland is a little creepy. (If the gender roles were reversed I'm sure it would be judged as great deal worse than creepy.)Overall, though, if you feel up to trying to understand something of depression from the inside, this might be a good place to start."

When depression is depressed, it's depressing to watch. That's mostly in the writing and I don't think Jolie is a good writer. She may have fair concepts but her dialogue does not sing. The flow is stuck in mud. The plot could have gone somewhere compelling. She needs to collaborate with a better writer who could help her work. This has potential but Jolie lacks the skills to exploit."
" Disappointed
",-0.4767,-0.7242,2017-09-10 00:00:00,1,"The film is about a couple going through the doldrums of their marriage. Actually, lower than the doldrums.The main characters are unredeeming. The supporting cast is OK, if somewhat wooden. For the most part - the film is about the disintegrated relationship between the two main character, the writer husband and his (former) dancer wife. Actually - that's the only thing this film is about.While there is improvement in their relationship over the period of the movie - it isn't a dramatic change.I can't help but wonder if this film was shot in order to give the stars somewhat of a working vacation in France. Also - the gist of the film somewhat mirrors the frustrations going on in the marriage of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at the time.Thankfully we borrowed this title from our local library. I would have been disappointed in myself had I have paid to rent or purchase it."
" Fantastic Film
",0.5574,0.9527,2017-09-09 00:00:00,7,"I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. I must admit, I had my doubts, being directed by Angelina Jolie and the romantic aspect. But I was very moved by this picture.It was a sweet, small little film that does wonders. It's romance, drama, and just a general good time.7 Stars, though it deserves one more"

" Stop directing movies, Angelina!
",-0.3595,-0.9401,2017-06-20 00:00:00,1,"Angelina has once again failed in every way possible with this movie! Her editing was bad, her directing was horrible, and her acting was just horrendous. She has failed to put out a good movie in quite some time and By the Sea was not even close to a good movie. Even the script was just horrible. If you think that being a voyeur is going to save your marriage, Jolie will show you all the ways that it won't with this movie. Even Brad Pitt should be ashamed of himself for his role in this movie as his acting was just as bad as Angelina's. Based off their lack of chemistry in this movie, I can understand why this couple got divorced. The movie was so slow that there were times that the only thing that saved the movie was the beautiful background of Malta. And Brad Pitt's car was the star of this movie in my opinion!"
" I enjoyed the direction and the nature
",0.5106,0.9493,2017-06-01 00:00:00,10,"The direction and scenography of this movie feels like a Greek summer in a Greek island. In my mind still remain wet pictures, the brown and the ceramid color, and beautiful people like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. I liked the direction and how the movie captured the life of the the couple. The ideal room istead feels like a prison for two lovers who are searching their own keys in their everyday salvation."
" The sea is the best thing that happens
",0.6369,0.9327,2017-05-08 00:00:00,5,"I kept waiting for something to happen to these two beautiful people. They are bored, and apparently not attracted to each other any more, but staying at a beautiful place surrounded by gorgeous scenery. They are unhappy, though. It's hard to empathize with these characters. Then they become obsessed with the newlywed neighbors, watching them have sex through a hole in the wall. Brad and Angelina become voyeurs, a turn-on, but not enough for their relationship. We find out later, it's because she's ""barren,"" in a scene that is almost laughable. Kept waiting for Angelina to show some emotion. I became bored early with her wooden performance. First saw this movie before their break-up, and saw it again recently. I can recommend it based on foreshadowing of the cracks in their marriage, leading up to the real life break-up. So much can be seen between the lines. For the beautiful scenery, I would definitely recommend. But for anyone who doesn't appreciate slow-moving films, you will probably not enjoy."
" Boredom By The Sea
",-0.3182,-0.7115,2017-05-07 00:00:00,1,"The only good thing about this movie was we didn't have to pay for other than on our cable bill. It should be on Lifetime next month. Another crying, spoiled, drama queen making a puff piece because she new she was getting dumped in real life. If this was what she promised Brad Pitt would save their relationship, he got suckered! Embarrassing to admit I watch it and sad for Brad Pitt he let Angelina drag him down with this garbage. Did she write this when she was 13? She can't act, He can't act, she can't write or direct, or dress herself. Now they are washed up.Go away Brad and Angie. Hollywood doesn't want you anymore and the public won't pay to see you ever again."
" I lived for a year in 1964 between Nice and Monaco, and this was NOT a ""Southern France"" location
",0.4215,0.3716,2017-03-16 00:00:00,4,"I lived for a year, all of 1964, in a coastal town between Nice and Monaco (specifically, in the Villefranche-sur-Mer and Eze-sur-Mer towns. Went to school near Cap Ferrat.)I read the description that this about a couple living in Southern France. Yet the scenery was more desert-like. I went to the ""Location"" page and, sure enough, filmed in Malta. A very long way from southern France.Perhaps a quibble, but it bugs me when I know a region and yet see something completely different on the screen. (Like seeing episodes of t.v. shows supposely set near some Eastern U.S. city and yet I can California mountains so plainly visible.)The film itself was very slow-moving and presaged the anomie and jadedness of Angela Jolie and Brad Pitt in their real lives at the time.--Tim May, California"
" One of the best I have ever seen
",0.6369,0.9793,2017-03-11 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie. I really did. It's not exactly what you think it's going to be and it goes where it goes in ways you don't really expect. I would call it an honest movie. I would call it a funny movie. It's something that you watch and you laugh. You laugh and laugh because it is so honest its like being exposed to someone's unconscious mind. And as such it's not exactly realistic either. It's a surreal movie, not quite to the point of being scary, but to the point of being very funny. All in all I have to say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And I hope to see many more."
" Luxuriating in boredom...
",0.0,0.8934,2017-01-17 00:00:00,2,"Glamorous married couple in the 1970s--he a writer who can't write, she a retired dancer--vacation at a French hotel overlooking the Mediterranean; he spends most of his time drinking at the local bar while she stretches out on the balcony with a book. 30 minutes goes by without much happening, while the viewer is asked to feast on the lush locale (the film was shot in Malta) and the endless movie star close-ups (which aren't so lush, as neither Brad Pitt nor Angelina Jolie Pitt, who also wrote and directed, look attractive here; she appears gaunt, and they both seem worn out). The couple, bored and prone to bickering, seem to be in a sexual rut, which is temporarily given a reprieve by the discovery of a small hole in the bedroom wall, perfect for peeping on the sexy newlyweds staying next door. Jolie Pitt may have overestimated she and real-life husband Brad Pitt's combined appeal, as their presence in these luxurious surroundings curiously fails to generate any interest, much less sparks. The voyeurism subplot promises drama that never really emerges, mainly due to the one-dimensional screenplay and flat handling. Alas, ""By the Sea"" sinks. *1/2 from ****"
" God, it's bad... it's so dang bad. God dang!
",-0.2193,0.4882,2017-01-07 00:00:00,1,"1 star just because Brad can act. Watching Angelina is like nails on a chalkboard... she pouts and poses... changes her outfits and puts on a lot of makeup. That pretty much sums it up! Hubby and I have been laughing throughout it and making snarky comments. I'd feel pretty bad it, except I'm irked I'm still up trying to ride this snail out to the end. Do we ever find out why she's so depressed? Do we even care? Ridiculous! Can she please slink back into the bathtub with all her makeup on, so Brad can just drown her already?!!! Just kidding... sort of. We have no idea how this movie scored anything above a single star. Oh wait, Brad can actually act!"
" Mostly Pittiful but must see the cinematography of By the Sea!
",0.0,0.9507,2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"Many critics and moviegoers thought that Angelina Jolie's ""By the Sea"" was at the apex of pittiful. I don't share that sentiment, but I am close. Jolie wrote and directed ""By the Sea"" about a couple who have been married for 14 years who travel to a France seacoast village to escape a recent tragedy. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as that married couple, Roland and Vanessa. Roland is a writer trying to recapture his scribe magic that gave him much acclaim for a past novel. Roland likes to roll a la Hemingway with plenty of alcoholic inspiration for his scribe. Vanessa is a frigid wife who is not very Jolie I mean jolly to those that she confronts. Roland and Vanessa then encounter a newlywed couple to the villa next to them, that would be Lea and Francois played respectively by Melanie Laurent and Melvil Poupad. Roland and Vanessa find a peephole that allows them to perverse I mean observe Lea and Francois' interactions. Do I need to say more how ridiculous this is. Sorry Angelina, but your direction and scribe of ""By the Sea"" was atrocious and absurd. Both Pitt and Jolie were not believable in their roles as Roland and Vanessa. One wondrous aspect of the film was the stunning cinematography by Christian Berger. He was the only Berger King of this movie. OK, just like Brad & Angelina, it is time for me to split. Sea you later! *** Average"
