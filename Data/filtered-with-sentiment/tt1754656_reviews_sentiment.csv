" A masterpiece
",0.6249,0.878,2021-03-31 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie that I can go back to over and over again. It is such a feel-good movie. The details in very scene are so well done. Honestly, simply a classic and a masterpiece."
" Interesting approach to the classic story
",0.4019,0.9432,2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"The Little Prince is an extremely short book, so if you want to make a full-length movie of it you need to add some stuff. This movie's approach is to create a story about a little girl who meets the aviator who narrated the book and hears the story from him. This gives us a good deal of the original story inside an engaging story of the girl's search for meaning and understanding.The animation is first rate and at times marvelously imaginative, and the whole thing is quite entertaining. Well worth your time."
" Great animation!
",0.6588,0.9169,2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"Good screenplay,
Good directing,
Good music,
Good dubbing,
Good editing,

If you say what was bad;
Its duration was a little longer, it could have been 20 minutes shorter.
The messages he gave were too obvious."
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.9485,2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,"The movie isn't 100% like the book but it is still worth the watch. You can get the same message from the book and from the movie. If you can't read the book you should watch the movie because its and amazing interpertation of the orginal book from 1942. The message is as important today as it was when the book was orginaly writen. So to summarize, if you have the time sit down and watch the movie because it is an amazing version of the book and it is another form of learning the important message the little prince represents."
" This must be classic!
",0.0,0.4926,2020-10-03 00:00:00,10,"One of the best animated movies. Yea, its good to be child, growing up is boring, life is also boring without fantasies, realism is boring!"

Then I'd say stop reading this review and go ahead and watch it without any hesitation, you won't regret it. The most amazing beautiful storyline ever, literally amazing. The movie is like the baseline of our century and our lifestyle since forever, it's pretty deep and gorgeous, I would've given it 100‚≠ê's if it were possible... It's that amazing. It's simply perfection that anybody could ask in a movie.. love it. Totally recommendable for any age, literally any age."
" beautiful interpretation
",0.5994,0.9143,2020-09-06 00:00:00,9,Movie brings lot of emotion and skilfully adapts original story to modern times. Very sad at times but valuable to watch. Animation is very good and Little Prince book parts is even better with different style.
" Cheerful laughter
",0.7717,0.9833,2020-08-01 00:00:00,9,"I think it's one of the most beautiful stop-motion animations I've seen. Okay, maybe after my favorite. Felt faces were so cute. Oh also musics were very wonderful.
So much so that I can listen to soundtracks to sleep or rest. To be honest, I was expecting a few more characters from the book. Like drunk man or the man who turns the street light on and off. At least film showed us their asteroids. I tried not to cry at the end of the movie. Finally, the movie does not go wrong with your imagination, as the book has drawings. Love it!"
" Excellent and beautifully animated
",0.8126,0.9609,2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"I'm not sure why I watched this because I'm definitely not the target demographic, but I loved it. You can tell how much love and effort was poured into this. It's one of those movies where the story doesn't always make sense, but it doesn't matter because it isn't that kind of story. The animation and claymation (papermation?) are painstakingly created and really beautiful, and the music is just as good. I freaking cried over it, although that may say more about me than the movie, at this point."
" Oh, there was a book, this makes more sense now
",0.0,0.9653,2020-07-08 00:00:00,7,"Really good watch, will watch again, and can recommend.Whatever animation style this was, is almost perfect stylization for me: it is varied, so it's not boring, but not so exaggerated that it is off putting, even in the characters where that is partly the intent.The voice acting is nearly perfect as well: Jeff Bridges, Mackenzie Foy, and Riley Osborn amazingly embody their characters. I honestly can't imagine the movie with other actors in place.My big problem with this one is that this is actually the 3rd part of a 3 part story that just happens to reference back to the first parts in a attempt to faux multi thread and drip feed information. Don't get me wrong, it does build a certain amount of intrigue, but it's one of the problems with ""The Lorax"", the audience is installed, just give us the story, you don't have to break it up.My other problem is that my biggest problem isn't enough to keep me complaining. It's a touching movie about keeping a certain amount of freedom and passion in your life, and while it is necessary to meet requirements, they can't always be the only thing that matters."
" Boring
",-0.3182,0.1531,2020-07-04 00:00:00,1,Extremely overrated movie. The story is boring and there are thousands of better movies for kids than this.
" Interesting way to adapt the book
",0.4019,0.9333,2020-06-04 00:00:00,8,"This is not a straight adaptation of the original book. It seemed to be a sequel to those events, but it also shows the events of the original book in 2D animated flashbacks that look like the original illustrations. This gives it a lot of new life since the original book had a very short story. It has the same themes and emotions and pulls them off well."
" Growing up
",0.1779,0.0235,2020-05-09 00:00:00,9,"The real problem is not growing up, but forgetting. The heart can see it clearly. The little prince is each of our childhood. It is a period of time that we forget or remember, but they are just the past, can not go back."
" Single mother syndrome.
",0.0,0.9079,2020-04-26 00:00:00,9,"TLP is a nice emotional movie about a girl who lives with her single bossy, independent and neglectful mother.The little girl meets and gets the attention of an old guy who was shunned in his past.I do like the movie because it's down to earth, fantasy and not obnixous like today's new hash.The movie gives an accurate representation of single moms and unhealthy homes.This movie teaches a life lesson on not rushing to grow. Or rush others to grow. Kind of like a Rose seed when you wait it will grow into a beautiful strong flower.When you rush rose seeds it won't grow well or at all.I recommend this movie to fantasy and adult-children."
" Some interesting visuals with a worn-out anti-job message.
",0.4019,0.9838,2020-03-27 00:00:00,6,"I understand there are limitations when it comes to adapting picture books into feature-length movies. The amount of content present in these books isn't even enough to cover a few minutes just reading it aloud, so extending it out over 100 minutes requires a bit of framing and exposition. While movies like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009) took the approach of explaining why there was giant food falling from the sky, The Little Prince (2015) framed its iconic story with your standard ""overbearing parent wants their child to succeed at the detriment of said child's childhood"" sub-plot.When I was growing up, I never encountered The Little Prince in all the picture books I read. Even without this prior knowledge, I could get a sense that the entirety of the book's content was contained in the stop-motion sections of this movie. I felt there was a missed opportunity to do the whole film in this style. Animated films seem to rely so heavily on CGI animation these days, that something which had a different visual aesthetic would have been a welcome change to the monotony. Granted, in splitting the animation styles, it allowed both stories to progress with little hindrance in understanding which plot was being followed.And while I understand the importance of children being allowed to play and have fun, the adult in me finds these anti-corporate/anti-job plots a bit tiring. Yes, we should all pursue our fun and creative passions, but how many of them pay enough to make a living? An individual's level of comfort will inherently dictate their compliance with the corporate structure. Sure, there are plenty of people who make a living on a meager artist's wage, but it's honestly not for everyone. Demonizing jobs and work does no good for children who will eventually have to grow up and provide for themselves.Some interesting visuals with a worn-out anti-job message, I give The Little Prince 3.0 stars out of 5."
" Sweet, and magical

It's a beautiful tale captured on the big screen with sweetnessWho will I recommend the movie to - anyone who'd like to watch something uplifting. There's good stuff even beyond PixarWhat did the movie teach me - it's all about perception. Just because something isn't visible, doesn't mean that it isn't.#OMAAT One Movie At A TimeHere, the word 'movie' refers to both movies and series."
" LIGHT-HEARTED.
",0.0,0.7649,2020-03-13 00:00:00,8,"The Little Prince is a deep and meaningful film with a twist of light-hearted childlike playfulness and imagination. The film is well thoughtout and reminds it's audience that it's okay to grow up, but it's never okay to forget the child side of yourself."
" Rubbish
",0.0,0.4033,2020-02-18 00:00:00,3,"This animation is very loosely based on the novella ""Le Petit Prince."" Please read the book before seeing this movie. Actually, skip this movie if you've read the book. The movie is really disappointing - it has nothing to do with the beautiful philosophy of the book's author, Antoine de Saint-Exupery."
" They has me on the first half
",0.0,0.9137,2020-02-02 00:00:00,6,"This movie tried to retell the timeless classic to a new era of kids and for a little while it does a good job, the stop motion scenes are beautiful and the relationship between the old man and the girl is sweet. The pilote is interesting and their friendship is strong enough to make me care about them.
I liked the parallel between the wild imagination of the pages and the strict world.However, they just danced around the main themes and I left wondering what is this movie even about.The last act is just horrific, the characters suddenly jumped into an action movie and dumbed down every lesson they tried to teach. Also the CGI little prince is so odd looking.The old man got into the hospital and the movie ended for me."
" Very good in its own way
",0.4927,-0.6934,2020-01-15 00:00:00,8,"This is a WEIRD movie. Magical? You could say that. Very distinctive, even if the animation isn't that great most of the time. Give this one a shot."
" Not so much for kids but so enjoyable
",0.7279,0.539,2020-01-05 00:00:00,9,"I red the book when I was way younger, and didn't remember the full story. Just saw it on Netflix without any expectation. At some point, I forgot it was a animated movie for kids.
I really did enjoy the movie, with all the subtles it can bring. Something was magical about it. I really recommand this movie."
" A faithful retake on the original
",0.6369,0.5106,2020-01-01 00:00:00,9,"So... The rose died?... It's because he left her...No, it's because he forgot her.Being one of my favourite books when I was a child, I think that even with all the clich√©s and the standardized animation style, in terms of the story being told, it does it's work and recreate a possible version of what could have happened.
I think this movie respects Exup√©ry's views on life, childhood, the role of dreams in all our sunrises and sunsets, and the role of the man who voluntarily alienates himself from his own feelings, from his dreams and utopias, as time passes and they become more diffuse. Something I find more explicit in his book ""night flight"".
You may like or dislike this movie. If you look at the technical details, it obviously has its flaws, if you are only looking for originality, it is obvious that it recounts something that they have already told us numerous times. But although the rose is only one more between thousands..."
" Neat but it's just wrong
",-0.4854,0.9574,2019-10-29 00:00:00,6,"This movie is a dumbed down, sugercoated and misinterpretated adaptation.
The animations are good but the movie faults on a fundamental level.
It makes an interpretation of the original story and rehash the story again somehow. I personally think they didn't get the original story right. (The prince is obviously part of another character and should never grow up!)
However you yourself should make your own interpretation and apply it to your own life. Why do you need the filmmakers interpretation to enjoy the original story?
There is also some stupid kids movie stuff in it, and death is made insignificant. I believe the original story is foremost made for adults. The infantilz ed art should just part of the narrative for the story.It's hard to score this since the original story is great which is basiclly the first half of this movie. The second half is pretty boring. Animation is good and I liked that they were smart enough not to name any of the characters.
However the -74 adaptation is the film version to watch. I seriously can't understand how this has an higherscore than that one."
" Beautiful from start to finish
",0.5994,0.9571,2019-09-30 00:00:00,10,The interesting take and expansion on the original book brought it into the current age while paying a wonderful homage to the original which has been reinterpreted so poorly many times before. Wonderful art transitions from past to present. Great film for everyone
" Good family movie
",0.4404,0.9427,2019-09-27 00:00:00,7,An easy to watch family film that features some really captivating animation. The story is one of hope and friendship and the first hour of the movie was really enjoyable to watch. I felt the conclusion was a little lack lustre in comparison to how it started but any movie which features Jeff Bridges is ually a win for me and he really gave the Aviator a heart and soul as he tranformed into character to care for.
" Very different than hollywood's formula animated films

" Stunning Animation & Beautiful Story
",0.7579,0.9744,2019-05-31 00:00:00,10,"In a world full of expectations for success a single mother does what she thinks is best to raise her daughter in preparation for adulthood. Meanwhile, fate brings an old man into the little girl's life and introduces a whole new world to her and shows her the imagination of childhood. This movie was great! The animation was creative and beautiful. The story line, based on the book, is such a good reminder to hang into what's important and not focus so much on what the agenda the world tries to push."
" Brilliant!
",0.6239,0.9853,2019-05-16 00:00:00,6,"Well now, this is a very special little film! There are so many hidden meanings here, the film deserves a few viewings. 'The Little Prince' definitely mocks grown-ups, or rather, it accurately depicts grown-ups.The film is like a wake-up call to break our daily routine and synchronized life style and just be free and live a little! It is interesting that an aerial view of the neighborhood looks like a computer motherboard - maybe the way adulthood has become!The animation is awesome and the score is fantastic. This was amazing. What an absolutely beautiful film!"
" One of best animated movies ever made!
",0.6696,0.9993,2019-04-19 00:00:00,10,"This movie is positively brimming with heart, warmth, and emotional moments, all layered over some pretty deep, thought-provoking concepts.It's rare to find a movie that can make your eyes glisten (from both sadness & joy at different points), but also inspire some good, deep conversations afterward from its rather big & adult themes.We had some great conversations after the film about what it means to grow up, about our societal views on work & play, and ultimately about how we define our own (and others') worth. There aren't much bigger themes than that, and the fact that the Little Prince deals with them all in such a charming, engaging, colorful way is a real treat.Kids will love the cute animation, the fox & the old man, the music, sure... but this is a movie made to delight & to challenge adults. Meaning its not just tolerable or ""enjoyable enough"" for all ages like a basic Pixar movie, its actually MADE for all ages.The film expertly intertwines the 4 main characters (all at different stages of life) to accomplish this. The Prince representing the naivety of youth & how that changes over time. The little girl representing the ""coming of age"" period, struggling with what it means to grow up or be more mature as she prepares to deal with a very adult life. The mother representing the challenges of parenting, of a busy work life, and of dealing with loss. And finally the old man in his twilight years, struggling with his relevancy; his ability to stay independent and do the things he loves; and trying to understand the context or worth of his past stories and lessons.The concepts are great, the characters are great, the voice acting behind them is top notch too. The music is stellar, and the animation isnt just great, its 2 kinds of great (2 separate styles used for different parts of the story, both captivating).The story is absolutely wonderful, full of surprises, twists, heart-wrenching moments and genuine laughs.To those complaining about connections with the book, I think you're missing 2 things:1st, this was never meant to be a retelling of the book or a reimagining of it, its clearly a new story, but built around the telling/reading of the book. Its not a remake, a reboot or a reimagining.2nd, in many ways this new story is meant to be for readers of the book, as a followup of sorts. The little girl represents us as readers of the book, struggling to connect with its message or believe in its relevancy in the modern world. The later parts of the movie with the Prince shows this as well, that often those who even give the messages of hope can lose sight of that message themselves.Its only in the connection between the two that the message of hope can survive or thrive in our modern world. Its takes the strength or courage of our current selves (represented by the girl), combined with accepting & embracing the hope of our youth (the Prince), to overcome the challenges of today & find that peace & joy.Its a beautiful, layered story that will sit with you long after you watch it, in a good way.I watch a lot of movies & review a ton (not on IMDB, but have a database of about 1000 I've watched & reviewed), & this was 1 of only about 25 true 10s that I have ever seen."
" Growing up isn't the problem... forgetting is
",0.1779,0.9661,2019-04-17 00:00:00,5,"The film is really so boring if you watch it by yourself but really amazing when that occurs with a friend....really so amazing
The correlation between the story of little Prince and the present of the children today reflects the great destruction occuring for children imagination, so many obstacles and restrictions were put in their way .....Learning should provide imagination not destruct it as occuring in Mantsorri
Being an adult shouldn't make you forget you were a child once upon a time...you are alive with a heart and mind knowing how to deal with a child means you make a great act.... That isn't easy in world's today....The last 46 minutes haven't made sense for me....Anyway I prefer the book more...."
" Great film
",0.6249,0.9313,2019-03-08 00:00:00,10,"The little prince is a book a hold dear in influencing my childhood and I think that this film was perfect at showing the theme of staying young at heart and is perfect for people of all ages. This along with beautiful animation and sound track, 10/10."
" the story is too adult
",0.0,-0.5859,2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"No, the story is too adult. We have grown up. We prefer childish stories. Maybe it's the so-called people who are hard to tear apart. Current society is a goal, a goal to delineate, can not comply with all will be eliminated."
" Moving and Well Executed
",0.2732,0.9779,2019-01-27 00:00:00,9,"The filmakers made one key mistake here: the choice of title. This film is rooted in the classic children's book The Little Prince, but it is not a film adaptation of that story. Rather, it is a meta story that centers around the character of the Aviator from that tale, who may also be (in actuality or else merely subtext) the author of the book itself. There's nothing at all wrong with that model-in fact, it's a very engaging treatment of a work that has taken such a larger place in the collective consciousness of the world we grew up in and live in now. It does, however, invite an unwarranted comparison and unmeetable expectations for both critics and audiences.As can be seen by the quickest of glances through the reviews, the debate that this creates is both entirely unwinnable and fundamentally flawed. It's a shame, because if the negative reviewers had gone into this film knowing it was ABOUT the book, and the relevance and impact of the book and it's messages to us as human beings trying to find meaning in our lives in our modern world, then they may have not had such an instinctive and negative reaction. There'd be no need. It's a film celebrating a treasured classic, not attempting to change or retell or even repackage it. I, personally, hadn't read the book, so I had no such expectations or reactions. But, I was legitimately confused as to whether the original book itself was so meta, circling around the characters and how they are changed by a fictional book within the book that we never really read in its entirety. It wasn't until I did some perusing of reviews that I learned the film was a meta treatment based around the book, but that the book itself was a more straightforward fantasy story. I supposed that's about as bad as if ""Christopher Robin"" or ""Goodbye Cristopher Robin"" had been titled ""Winnie the Pooh"".Setting aside the confusing if not outright misleading choice of title, however, what we are left with is a beautifully-animated film with a lot of depth and emotion that is nothing but respectful, no... reverant, of the book. There's nothing here to feel badly about. It uses the book and its fantastical story as a focal point of introspection on the role that a childlike sense of wonder and innocense play in making us human, even into adulthood. It looks at the now-cliched contrast between the oppression and sterility of adult life in the modern world with the necessity for finding inspiration, awe, and beauty in the world around us-something we all seem to have instinctively as children, but sometimes risk forgetting as we age. But there's nothing trite here, despite the fact that it's been done before (Finding Neverland comes to mind, though a very different type of film, the underlying emotional themes about the innocence of childhood). There's a stark authenticity here that makes this film memorable and effective in conveying its core message and, for me, I came away feeling very touched and grateful for the experience. There's not much more one could expect or hope for, unless they had been expecting something else very specific, in which case they might rightly feel misled. But it still shouldn't take away from the merit of the material itself."

My heart is often overwhelmed at how quickly innocence and childhood is sucked away in our culture. I personally felt when I was young that innocence was to be looked down upon. As most encounter, the years couldn't go by fast enough for my young self, constantly wishing to be older and wiser. Now is the time I look back. I deeply appreciate this film because it cherishes the beauty of a child's imagination. The animation leaves me awestruck at its beautiful simplistic style of stop motion. I cannot help but by transported back into my ever too short childhood along with the little girl and the Prince. I hope more teenagers and adults will stumble upon this piece of art because it is such a good reminder to cherish our imaginations amidst our mundane every day life."
" A Feat Of Animation

""This wasn't done the way I'd do it"", or ""that seems like a dumb way to make that happen"" often comes out of my mouth as I watch some animated productions lately. I've seen The Little Prince three times all the way through since it has gone live on Netflix, and I can say with unassailable faith that it is not just one of the greatest animated feature-length films ever made, but one of the greatest stories ever told. I try not to give too much credit to adaptations, but I can't help it with this one: it's an emotionally-charged, superbly-written roller coaster."

Well that's how I (and my family and friends) found this movie. The song that sold the trailer was not to heard during the movie (which I find really annoying). Our kids didn't finish watching this coz it bored the living daylights out of them (my friends kids watched it and didn't like it as well).
No wonder why Paramount dropped this film from cinemas at the last moment coz the studio must've seen the finished product and knew mainstream audiences ain't going to dig it.

The Little Prince is my favorite book & I was terrified it would be terrible, but I am so glad I was wrong. This film is heartwarming & brings to life all of the charm the book has. The animation style is perfect & captures the characters beautifully. There are a few nitpicky things I didn't enjoy as much, but it did the book so much justice. If you haven't read The Little Prince, please do! It's short & lovely & a real classic. But if you are not a reader, this movie encapsulates the intellect & message of the book in the best way possible. If you, like me, are concerned about watching this film because you love the book, give it a watch. I guarantee it will not disappoint you."

" Rather good
",0.4404,-0.4277,2018-06-17 00:00:00,7,"In a French suburb, a girl of maybe nine has a hyper-ambitious mother who has over-scheduled the girl's life. Naturally, the girl connects with their eccentric, ostracized neighbour: a former pilot who tells her stories of the title character, taken from the novella by Antoine de St-Expury. This review is for the film's English-language version.The greatest delights in this film are the ways it mocks our modern world. It begins by focusing on a child whose childhood is being ripped away and compares her to an elderly man who refused to let his childhood spirit die. They are surrounded by drone people living in cloned modern homes. Brief scenes mocking office clones and uppity schools are a joy.With so much going for the film, there's almost a feeling of anti-climax by the end. There is certainly nothing wrong with it but the main story has less bite than the occasional satire that rightly criticizes the worst of modern times. But the overall message is worth it: despite the insane demands of our modern world, we can get through it if we stay connected to our childhood spirit and imagination."
" Simply enchanting
",0.0,0.918,2018-05-28 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. There were many parts that I did not understand but I still loved every moment of it. I have never read or even heard of the book. It seems that there are many different interpretations of this story. No matter which you choose, it is a poignant and delightful tale.First off you have to suspend disbelief a little bit. Obviously in the real world a little girl secretly spending time alone with her old neighbor would not be a good idea. But in this realm we know right off the bat that everything will be fine.I found it very interesting that not a single one of the characters has an actual name. I found myself not even realizing this until halfway through. The little girl's mother had already fully immersed her in the essential world of adults and she had no friends and was not permitted to be a child. I love how no matter how perfect and rigid the mother tries to be, there is always one tiny piece of hair sticking out of place against her forehead. I thought that this was very poetic. And in the end when she finally learns from her daughter, she is wearing casual clothes to show that she has calmed down. I also thought it was very sad and beautiful when the aviator left the mother an illustrated apology note and a rose to try to make amends for the damage he had done to their house. She read the note over and then immediately disposed of it as well as the rose as they were not ""essential"" to her. This is the mother tossing away his attempt to connect with her.I personally feel that The Little Prince represented The Aviator's inner child, I do not believe he was actually a separate entity at all. We see in the very beginning that The Aviator used to love to create drawings that no one understood. The very first thing The Little Prince asks the aviator to do when he crashes in the Sahara dessert is to draw him something. I think that the aviator's troubled mind upon waiting for rescue or death conjured the image of his former self to comfort him since he was all alone. The Little Prince asks the aviator to draw him a sheep which is often symbolic of being a conformist or ""part of the herd."" I believe that the little prince is killed by the snake in the dessert, or at least the idea of him is. The aviator's drawings in the beginning depicted creatures being swallowed whole by snakes and to me this seems like what happened to the little prince. But it was only a shell, and as the little prince said, ""No one is sad over old shells."" So the aviator fixes his plane and moves on, but never forgets the little prince.We see the dangers of growing up too fast and also of never growing up in this movie. It was very unhealthy for the little girl to be so involved in the adult world already, her mom talking to her at length about work problems and her being able to file police reports. It was also just as unhealthy for the aviator to still be acting like a child. He could have killed the little girl several times, particularly when they are both beholding a butterfly and he runs the stop sign. Most of the adults were depicted as villains, people who had entirely forgotten their former selves and who no longer possessed love or hope for anything or anyone. ""Growing up is not the problem, forgetting is."" The key is to grow up but to hold on to what is most essential, what cannot be seen with the eye, but with the heart instead.Even though this movie and book are dubbed a fantasy, I am fairly certain that everything that happened with the little girl taking the plane to find the little prince is just a result of the fall that she took. I do not think that the little prince was real, I think it is just the idea of him that is important. She imagined him lost on a planet of adults who had corrupted him and now she must save him and reawaken hope in his heart. It is important to her that Mr. Prince remembers who he is because she is so terrified that she will suffer the same fate, especially when the aviator leaves her. It was beautiful when he turned back into the little prince in the end and she was able to finish the aviator's story for him before his ended. I loved all of the symbolism in this movie and the all star cast. Paul Rudd's scene with the little girl in the end when the rose dies is particularly heart wrenching. James Franco also spoke very tenderly as the fox. Human connections are certainly what is most essential in this world."
" Enjoyable
",0.4404,0.9493,2018-04-08 00:00:00,8,"This movie is incredible with an interesting story, heartfelt moments, and beautiful animation. This is a fantastic movie that is well worth watching."
" Beautiful, Charming and ADORABLE!
",0.9173,0.9965,2018-04-02 00:00:00,10,"A multi-country collaboration between a LOT of studios, by the director of Kung Fu Panda adapted The Little Prince, one of France's most beloved children's books back in 2015. The film however, takes a very interesting approach to the book.For those who haven't read it, The Little Prince contains a lot of philosophical anecdotes, the first several of which have a theme of the child versus the adult. And this movie opens with a girl being raised in a strict household with her mother's intention of turning her into a ""proper adult."" But then she makes friends with the strange eccentric man next door, who is the aviator and writer of the The Little Prince book, (in universe.)Just to clarify that The Little Girl is not in the little prince book. Also, none of the characters in the book or the movie, have proper names. The movie cuts between the story of the prince, and the little girl's reaction to the story.And in a nutshell, this movie is INCREDIBLY good. I love it. It feels like a movie that could have come right out of a mainstream Western studio; if they didn't have to force in a joke every 10 seconds, and were allowed to be subtler and metaphorical. While it does draw the lines between kids and adults in such a blatant, stark way, and maybe her transition from a mini adult into a playful kid is a little bit too easy, and MAYBE this whole lesson of keeping hold of your inner child isn't really one this generation has any problems with, there's still a lot of relatable, inspirational material here!I love the way she initially reacts to the story in a SUPER literal way, which seems to echo how much fiction is judged that way recently! Also, this film approaches the concept of belief in a remarkably mature and tactful way.But then the last act suddenly takes a SHARP left turn, and takes on a VASTLY different tactic of re-imaging the book that's an interesting idea, but completely ruined because of how over-the-top spastic-ally CONTROLLING the tone was. Also, because the moral is SPELLED OUT to the audience, which it didn't need to be.But overall, I thought this movie was AMAZING. It's beautiful, it's touching, and it gets these really complex ideas across in very relatable ways. This is a movie I would watch again and again."
" very whimsical, imaginative, and magical

" First rate beautiful stop motion within a CGI animation, which is the book inside the film.
",0.4019,0.9569,2017-11-05 00:00:00,8,"I watched the french version of course. Super excellent for the animations, the story inside the story and the way the director depicts that the film is only one way of interpreting the sourced book. It is funny to see that the french company making the film is owned by an English company. This is about true of the narrative, the french book is owned by the English story telling it or about it. There is quite a bit of ironies. The school in the film wants to make essential adults, while the main point of the book is to make us realise that the essential is invisible. It is a sort of recuperation by the English. As to what is the essential, it is wisely left to our own ideas. The book is all very slow and ponderous. Very philosophical. This film is more grounded and adventurous although some of it is imaginary."
" Eviscerates the Little Prince and twists his guts into a million Disney rebellions
",-0.2732,0.8287,2017-08-24 00:00:00,3,"The movie version of The Little Prince is a travesty, encouraging little girls to lie, disobey and disrespect their parents, like a Disney princess. The movie version is selling little girls a world where they get what they want with moxie, inexperience and a little magic, just like the Disney princesses do. None of this has anything to do with the story of The Little Prince, which was artlessly appended to this Disney ripoff.The book, The Little Prince is not a children's book. It is philosophic and traumatic, neither of which should be applied to children. Although it artfully depicts death as a spirit leaving a body, it does not pretend to be a book on theology. When we see someone die, we know that the spirit is gone. Where the spirit goes is theological in nature, and the book covers this only in passing. In the book, we are free to assume that the Little Prince is back on his little asteroid with his Beloved, staying busy and enjoying eternity. The next morning the body of the Little Prince was gone; does this remind you of anyone special? The book makes no claim to be a reinterpretation of the Passion, but it is a useful reference for anyone who has to explain death to a child. We all die. We all leave our body and go to meet our Beloved. We who love Logos will remain alive. One day we will be given our eternal body and we won't have to wander any more.The book The Little Prince allegorizes the beauty and errors of the universe with humor and wry philosophical ponderings. The movie eviscerates the Little Prince and twists his guts into a million Disney rebellions. Did I mention it was a travesty of the book? There oughta be a law."
" Great movie, but could be better if it's not animated
",0.7506,0.9408,2017-08-18 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie on an airplane and watched it again when I got home. This is a heart warming story, and it really reminds me to think about what's really important. However, I think this movie would be better if it is not animated. The graphic is a little jumpy, and the image of the girl is just a little odd. The figure of the little prince is great though, it is exactly what I imaged he would look like after reading the book. Still, great movie, and I'll definitely watch it again."
" A film that's more confusing that beautiful.
",0.4535,0.9907,2017-05-29 00:00:00,6,"Have you ever heard of the animated film ""Ernest & Celestine""? You probably haven't and that's because it didn't receive a wide release. The film was made in France, starred the fine¬†young actress Mackenzie Foy along with Forrest Whitaker, and focused on the friendship between a mouse named Celestine and a bear named Ernest. I loved the film from beginning to end and it was certainly a sweet animated movie. The reason I say this is because ""The Little Prince"" is another animated movie that is pretty similar. It was¬†made in France, also starred Mackenzie Foy, focused on a friendship, and didn't get a wide release with the film being released on Netflix in the United States. When I saw that the film was selected for completion at the Cannes Film Festival in 2015¬†and critics praising the film calling it a beautiful masterpiece, I got interested. I watched the movie after the film was released to Netflix and I'm sad to say¬†that I didn't really enjoy the movie because¬†I couldn't get into this film. ¬†I'll try to explain why because honestly it was really hard to follow this film.The film focuses¬†on a young girl played by Mackenzie Foy. Her mother (Rachel McAdams) is trying to get her into this big academy and decides to prep¬†her throughout the entire summer with a giant schedule telling her to read the schoolbooks and doing complex work. However, an old aviator (Jeff Bridges) gets her distracted and tells her stories about a young boy called The Little Prince (Riley Osborne) and how the aviator met him after crash landing¬†in the Sahara Dessert¬†. The girl then skips doing her daily assignments and goes to the old aviator every day and continues listening to the story about the Little Prince, not telling her mother.From what I just said, it doesn't sound bad at all, but trust me when I say¬†the story is definitely the worst part about this movie. ¬†Having never read the book it was based only by¬†Antoine de Saint- Exup√©ry, I judged the film on it's own and honestly it started¬†off decently, but then I got confused with the sections about The Little Prince and then about a third¬†though the movie, I was totally lost. The movie just went spiraling out of control with¬†no focus whatsoever and when the film ended I was left so baffled and confused. The characters didn't really leave much of an impact on me either. They're a couple of reasons for this. One is that they have no names. I mean none whatsoever. The movie just credits them as ""The Aviator"", ""The Mother"", or ""The Little Girl"" and that did get me a little frustrated because I find it¬†lazy when a movie doesn't give characters names. The second problem with them is that, I didn't feel they had a clear personality. I mean, some I could understand like The Mother and The Little Girl, but characters like The Aviator and especially The Little Prince had very little to no personalities. As for the animation, I'm pretty split about. The stop motion elements of the movie¬†I think are beautiful. It may not be as good as ""Kubo and the Two Strings"", but I thought it was pretty well done.¬†They have a paper like feel to them and I definitely¬†could see the craft in them. The computer animation parts, however, seemed amateur to me. I felt like they were done by an animation student¬†and not by¬†professionals which is a problem when you get down to it. I also really hated the cinematography in the film. Most of the shots were straight and didn't have tilts or were shot in different angles, they were just straight and that kind of became irritating ¬†after a while. Now I will give the movie credit on this though. The voice acting is outstanding. I thought the characters were well casted and performed and they definitely brought something to the characters, but not a lot.""The Little Prince"" was just a confused mess. I could see something trying to get out of this film, but the story was just to confusing for me to grasp. I really was not impressed, which is a shame as I could see that this¬†film really did try. However, I thought this film was trying to be a nice and sweet animated movie and it failed to accomplish. If you want much better¬†animated movies that are nice and sweet, might I suggest watching the aforementioned""Ernest & Celestine"" or even the director's previous work ""Kung Fu Panda"". Those movies had much more joy and balance than this film ever did, and besides they both got Oscar nominations anyway."
" Lousy revisionist bechdel story with virtually nothing to do with original
",-0.296,-0.9977,2017-03-28 00:00:00,1,"I would give this a zero if IMDb allowed a zero. This lame, pseudo adaptation of the Little Prince deserves nothing precisely because it has NOTHING to do with the book. It capitalizes on a good story by turning it into some dreadful vehicle for how ""it would have been such a better story if it had been entirely about a girl who saves several men..her mother..and probably the population of a small, androgynous colony on Mars... from the failures they were doomed to, without her...sniff"". really, really lousy. Saint-Exupery wrote a beautiful story. But it didn't involve a precocious girl (oh, poor, poor sad thing.) who was exploited by her single, regretful mother (oh, bad, bad mummy) and how said girl redeems the life of a crusty old man or the eponymous Little Prince. This SUCKS. SUCK FEST. FESTIVAL OF SUCK. SUCKY, SUCKY, SUCKY, SUCKY, SUCKY SUCK. i think you get my drift. SUUUUUUCKCKCKCKCKCKS!!!!!!!!"
" Good, but not perfect
",-0.4673,0.9896,2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"A lot of people are probably going to hate me for not giving this a perfect score but the thing is, I really did enjoy this film! I admit to being very unfamiliar with the original book version of ""The Little Prince"". I only know that it's one of the best selling books of all time. I hear some people regard this as a stop motion film, but most of it isn't that at all. I was kind of disappointed by that, because while the CGI was good, the stop motion was simply fantastic. The details were down so perfectly and the characters had more depth this way. I still like the idea of two styles being blended together.I also like the story a lot, particularly with how it deals with a little girl who has a mother who literally arranges everything in her life to happen at a specific time. Most of us know what it's like to live with someone who wants everything to be precise. I admit that the film does get weak in the last third, particularly with how it suddenly turns into a dystopian future-like world. I do like the reveal for the main villain. This is the first and probably only movie I'll ever see on my Netflix as my free trial is ending. I had no idea it was just a Netflix movie so boy am I glad I saw it there! ***"
" Disappointing would be an understatement
",-0.4939,0.9211,2017-03-07 00:00:00,3,"Three stars only for the sequences that actually came from the book, as the stop motion work is quite beautiful and well executed.But the framing story, which seems to think we need the message pounded on us with a twenty- pound sledge hammer, was totally unnecessary and ‚Äî as I""m afraid it might be ‚Äî put in a sop as part of the ""empower little girls!"" campaign currently running through almost all media. (Let me add, I have no problem with empowerment, but it doesn't need to be slathered over *everything*.)The Little Prince isn't about empowerment. It really isn't about the power of imagination, although the marketing might like you to believe that. Rather, it's a meditation on life and death, on love and loss ‚Äî and the filmmakers here completely missed the point in their rush to create this mangled view of a book whose message comes from a more delicate and thoughtful place. I applaud the art, to be sure ‚Äî the CG work is nice... just not for this particular story. It needs its own story to tell, not tailgating on the back of something else."
" not just the essential
",0.0,0.9907,2017-01-21 00:00:00,9,"The Little Girl lives with The Mother. Her father is absent with the exception of his gifts of glass globes. She fails her interview for the prestigious Werth Academy. Her mother moves them into the wealthy neighborhood for the school. Their home is the cheapest due to their eccentric new neighbor. It's the summer holidays and mother has set a scheduled regiment for the little girl to prepare for her long march to adulthood. Their neighbor is The Aviator. He becomes the Little Girl's best friend as he describes his adventures with The Little Prince.I read The Little Prince for french class. It was tough enough to translate the thing. Plenty went over my head especially something like the Rose. One needs to appreciate the adult relationship being portrayed and also its autobiographical nature. The essentially literary nature of the book makes it more than a children's book. It's never been for the littlest kids although they probably like the pictures. The film takes the essentials of the book and adapts it into a cinematic Pixar-level movie. It's really the best of both worlds being combined here.There is a switch in the world around the start of the third act. It concerned me a little about the execution. It would have been a lot easier to switch to the book instead. The Fox probably kept my faith with his humor. He is hilarious. Mr. Prince is a little problematic. It's like making Peter Pan grow up and I didn't appreciate that in Hook. However, it is all very audacious and it pulls everything together in the end.There are many complaints about what this movie isn't. It isn't a kiddie movie and this isn't trying to be an ""Ice Age"" movie. It's digging into deeper material and I compare it more with ""Where the Wild Things Are"". That movie is definitely too dark for little kids. This isn't a simple transcription of the book. The book is unlikely to be good narrative for a two hour movie. This is able to translate this literary classic into a compelling movie structure. It's a heart-warming coming-of-age story as long as one haven't forgotten."
" Not bad interpretation of a classic
",0.431,0.9777,2017-01-10 00:00:00,7,"Greetings from Lithuania.So i did like ""The Little Prince"" (2015) overall for the following reason - great and universal message that should appeal to everyone. I liked the voice acting, although there isn't anything special. Animation itself was beautiful. Script was OK, but the movie kinda dragged to me here and there, and i wasn't highly engaged into the story, at least for a second half of it. First half of this movie was good, second after the little girls sets out to find The Little Prince the story kinda started to drag. But still i liked the message overall, but i'm not so sure the youngest audience members will get it yet or will be highly involved into the story but lets face it, the audiences today need movies like ""Finding Dory"" or ""Frozen"" and etc. - i can't imagine ""The Little Prince"" being a big box office success. Overall, i did like ""The Little Prince"" overall, but it is sometimes draggy story. While the main part of Little Prince itself was good, it was maybe a little to short and they should focus so much on a little girls story. Nice animated movie overall, but nothing that special."
