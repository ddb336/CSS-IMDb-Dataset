" Good movie! Ignore the negative reviews.
",-0.5562,0.4879,2021-04-11 00:00:00,8,"I read all the mostly negative reviews and was ready for a cr*p movie, but watched it for the sake of the history.Turns out that it was NOT a bad movie. The CGI was kinda poor, but outside of that... I have it 8stars. I liked it. Really... make up your own mind."
" A disservice
",0.0,-0.7506,2021-03-17 00:00:00,1,This film is horribly made. They added nonsequitors to explain simple concepts and constantly manufacture drama when portraying one of the most harrowing events in human history. This makes Pearl Harbor look like a good war movie. Mario Van Peebles should stay in retirement. I logged on for the first time in 4 years and went through the password reset just to convey how bad this movie is. I would rather have sat in shark infested waters for 42 hours.
" Great story but average movie
",0.3716,-0.6786,2021-02-23 00:00:00,5,The story of the USS Indianapolis is tragic. The story of all the men of this ship is heroic. Sadly the movie is really average. Sad
" It's not about the CGI, but the STORY!
",0.0,0.9683,2021-02-19 00:00:00,8,"This is a story I've been interested in since, like most, I saw Robert Shaw tell it in Jaws. I was thrilled to finally see a film had been made about the Indianapolis and its crew. And as far as I'm concerned, it lived up to the history! Sure, the CGI was pretty bad, but it wasn't about that - it was about the story of these brave men who were hung out to dry by their own government. Yes, all the back stories were probably untrue, but I found the whole film intensely moving. What happened to these men was a tragedy and the cast, director, writers etc. did a wonderful job in making them into real live human beings. I highly recommend the film. And the score was fabulous!"
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.8741,2021-02-06 00:00:00,4,"The acting is not that good, and Nick Cage looked bored. The CGI is poor, especially the shark attacks which looked like they came from a ""Sharknado"" movie. And why cut away to stories about fictitious crew members relationships in the US? Finally, the I-58 (the Japanese sub) torpedoed the starboard side of the ship, not the port side. Needless to say, I was disappointed by the movie. I would recommend the documentaries ""USS Indianapolis: The Legacy"" (I think it was on the History channel, don't remember for sure) and ""USS Indianapolis: The Final Chapter"" from PBS."

I thought the CGI shark stuff and the men in the ocean was pretty lame. I give -1 star because there was supposed to be 1000 men in the water and you never see anywhere near that. I give +1 Star because the parts where they do show what happened to some of the men in the water .I thought the political statement stuff was unnecessary. -1 Star for that....
Even if it was touching.A lot of good men ON BOTH SIDES, and ON ALL SIDES....died in that war. And a lot of bad men died too. Such is the nature of war.This could have been better imo. 4/10"

" The actual footage and pictures at the end were way more impactful than the movie.
",0.0,-0.9243,2020-06-25 00:00:00,5,"I had recently stumbled upon a youtube video about the history of USS Minneapolis and really wanted to watch a movie about it. After watching ""the Finest Hour"" and ""the Command"" I was very excited to have found another disaster-in-the-ocean movie. However, I was pretty disappointed with the movie from early on.
CGI in the movie was not believable and took away from the experience. The sinking of the ship was almost like watching Titanic again with similar shots, angles, and keys to a lock-up falling in water , except Titanic did it WAY better.
Then there were the sharks. The actual story is tragic enough that there was no need for the dramatic, surprise ""out of nowhere"" attacks by the sharks. I really did not like that there was so much emphasis on the sharks from early on. I feel that it should have been a surprise to the viewers so as to give the viewers that feeling of a disaster on top of a disaster. At no point did I feel that I was with the characters feeling their pain. Neither through the sinking nor during the 3.5 days of floating in the ocean. One of the bigger disappointments was that the movie failed to show how men were scattered over miles after the sinking of the ship. The movie moved on way too fast for viewers (or at least for me) to be fully immersed into the scenes. The way that the Japanese submarine was introduced just seemed too rushed.The way it surfaced to the top before attacking USS Minneapolis was too abrupt.I did like the overhead shot of the ship while passing under the golden gate bridge.I give the movie 4 stars because it was still informational about the disaster and what followed."

" Bizarre mis-step dumped onto streaming platforms in order to find audience?
",-0.6124,-0.4852,2020-03-25 00:00:00,3,"This territory has been covered already with the lower budget film ""Mission of the Shark: The Saga of the U.S.S. Indianapolis"" in 1991, which handled things far better on a far smaller budget. The cast here ought to have been a warning, flooded with a litany of Hollywood has-beens, Cage unfortunately included. While I think a few of them put in surprisingly good performances here and there (especially Sizemore, who had already reduced himself to exclusively starring in bargain-bin Z-movies by this point), the acting here really can't do much to salvage a terrible script filled with inaccuracies and anachronisms. The real kicker here has to be the solidly amateurish CGI and compositing, coupled with the total lack of realism and originality.The narrative follows a lazy love triangle, orbited by a few subplots that come to absolutely nothing. There's an unambitious cretin who steals a ring and a do-gooder who is obsessed with becoming a writer. Is there anything else in these characters worth learning about? How about that sinking? Is that handled well? Well it's worth a laugh at least how they decided to pattern it exactly after the climax of TITANIC.When I saw Mario Van Peebles listed as the film's director, things (kind of) made more sense, though even he's directed countless better films than this, especially NEW JACK CITY. It's baffling to me how a film this bad could still get made for a reported $40m budget. Looking at it, I'd have guessed $39.5m must have gone to the actors' paychecks as it otherwise looks as cheap as an Asylum Mock-Buster type film. They didn't even get the species of shark right. The only possible theory I can summon for this film's existence is that it was set up as some kind of cynical quickie foreign tax shelter merely masquerading as a patriotic celebration of wartime heroism.It's pathetic and cringe-inducing, but I can say to Van Peebles' infinite credit that at least he manages to keep it from getting dull."
" One of the most important disasters never told in film
",-0.4186,0.2469,2020-01-30 00:00:00,2,"Does anyone who attempts to make a film about the USS Indianapolis ever do their homework? I've read 4 books on the subject (in the order in which I read them)- ""In Harm's Way"" by Doug Stanton, ""Abandon Ship"" by Richard Newcomb, ""Out of the Depths"" by David and Edgar Harrell (Edgar Harrell being a survivor), and ""Indianapolis"" by Lynn Vincent and Sara Vladic, and I fully intend to read more. Already it appears that I've read 4 books more on the subject than the writer of this movie.The Indianapolis is a story that NEEDS telling. People need to see it in movie form that entices them to learn about it and how badly the US Navy and government wronged those that died as well as those that survived and court-martialed a good man and good commander simply because the ones who were truly to blame held higher ranks.Movies done like this one, hitting wide to the side only turn people off from learning the true and terrible story. Seriously, horror movies cannot express what terrible things those men went through. Could someone PLEASE make a movie that does justice to this disaster and actually honors those who died in it and those who survived? This movie really did nothing but tick me off. You didn't even get the sharks right. Great whites, though they travel the world, are not open ocean, deep water sharks to begin with. If any were involved, they were likely very few. The main culprit was the oceanic whitetip, possibly the most aggressive shark in the world. Stop messing this story up."
" Overwhelmingly underrated (Nick' Cage hating?)
",-0.128,0.8724,2020-01-28 00:00:00,8,"Based on a true story does not mean identical to it, in fact, anyone who has seen anything knows to take that one line with a few grains of salt.
This is a decent movie. Has a bit of a Pearl Harbour feel to it, blended with some survivophobia, the acting on average holds good standards, peaking av very good thanks to Tom Sizemore and Cage. Some questionable CGI quality but then, thats not what this movie is about, its not Jurassic Park or the Avengers.It could have been made in other ways and the know-it-alls here on iMDB each have their own ""perfect"" version in mind. If only they would have become movie makers, such wonders we would see!So why this low rating for a movie that should atleast be above a 6 ?
Inaccuracies in historical depiction are not in this case a justifiable reason for the low rating, there are many titles out there who rank far higher despite their flaws. What i see is a bunch of high horsed pseudo-intellectuals who pass themselves off as being historically
enlightened after having ""read-up"" on Wikipedia (cough) when in fact they want an excuse to trash something good - and what better way than to do so than with a Nick-Cage movie, not many will save him from the sharks these days."

But in a relaxed and sympathetic way. For example, there is a scene where some do gooder says to the colored sailers that ""you are dying for a country that treats you really bad"". And the response is that the sailors of all heritege start talking about that they joined up to get away from the street of xyz and to chase foreign tail. Neat. Antiracism done right.And the ordeal in the water, there are sharks, they are scary but they are not the main problem. This must have been a huge temptation and many that have covered this event have focused exclusively on the shark attacks. But if we imagine being in the ocean for three and a half days without water, do we even need sharks at all to explain the the casualties?The story is a bit wonky at times but it was such a breath of fresh air not to have all my emotions and conclusions and moralism super closely directed. As is customary in other movies these days. So this was very valuable to me and made me enjoy this movie a lot."

" Solid WW2 Historical Film - USS Indianapolis

This film makes Jaws look like a swim in your family pool. I am not kidding. The only appalling part of the film was the behavior of the United States Navy toward the Captain of this ship. He was a scapegoat. There seemed to be a collection of Navy idiots linked to this incident; all of them high-ranking officers. Other than that, the film captures your attention from beginning to end.

Sending an unprotected cruiser into the middle of Japanese defended waters with no ASW protection and no CAP cover, it could hardly end up any other way. To be sure, no today warship (which have NO armor) would do any better if she was exposed to enemy subs or attack aircraft.The most amazing part of the story is that the captain of the USS warship was put on trial, while on a secret mission with no support, losing most of his men to exposure, saltwater poisoning and sharks. But that is standards US politics, unfortunately. A convenient scapegoat.I liked Mario van Peebles directing. He rose from playing a supporting role in Heartbreak Ridge, to a leading role in a B-class movie American Warships, to directing this. I salute him!"
" Painful to watch

While in port, a fighter plane flys close aboard and skims the water next to the ship.
There is a engineering Chief directing repairs to the bow. This same Chief makes a report to the Captain about the readiness of the ""big guns"".
An admiral, in port, gives the Captain instructions to follow after he ""weighs anchor"". No ship anchors pier side, the instructions should have been followed after the ship ""gets underway"".
A group of sailors are punished with ""mess hall"" duty. There are no ""mess halls"" aboard ship, there are mess decks...
A scene when the ship is underway shows every gauge in the engine room at zero.
The command to abandon ship is given ""all hands on deck, abandon ship"". You don't direct the crew on deck first to go over the side, it's just ""abandon ship"".
The phonetic alphabet used was not the one used during WW2.
The Captain addresses a Signalman First Class as Signalman. It would have been "" Petty Officer"" Jones.
After several days in the water, the Captain needs a shave but the rest of the crew was clean shaven.

Most of the deaths in this tragic event was not actually from the heavy cruiser going down, but from shark attacks. Of 1,195 crewmen aboard, about 300 went down with the ship. Thus the remainder , including the captain of the Indianapolis, Captain McVay (Nicolas Cage), would face exposure, almost no food or water, dehydration and shark attacks while floating in not enough lifeboats. This makes for a very interesting and dramatic movie; factual as can be...probably not. Is this a waste of time, definitely not.! Mario Van Peebles directs.

" This film is sunk by poor CG effects, not a torpedo...
",-0.4767,0.9183,2018-09-23 00:00:00,7,"To preface this review, I never read other reviews on a film before I write my own. This is a subject ripe for a film for decades. The film is worth seeing but not fantastic. Note: stating that the ship in question is sunk is not a ""spoiler"" but is common knowledge and if it is not, then pass the blame onto poor public school funding nationwide and not this review. We shouldn't compensate for stupid people, but raise the bar for everyone. Onward.
Good story, good acting, nice little nods to the movie Jaws but also flawed on actual facts, ie. the sharks. Quint's famous shark story got it right, the sharks were Tigers not great white's as this film portrays. The directing was competent but there were many moments he missed getting real ""movie moments"" which in a more, I would not say experienced but ""filmic"" directors hands, would have elevated this film to a higher bar. For those of you that don't know what a ""movie moment"" is... basically it's those moments in a film everybody remembers, if not consciously, at least leaves the imprint unconsciously on the viewer. A director like Spielberg is a master of ""movie moments"" and that is why his films are memorable. And now onto the weakest link in the chain...the CG effects, or defects if you prefer.
The budget of this film is $40 million, not a huge amount anymore for a Hollywood film but still a sizable sum. Perhaps it would have been wiser to cut down on the name actors in the film and hand that to the effects department. But Hollyrock producers still think that only name actors pull in the audience and not a good story. Some of the effects are really good, some good shark effects whether on set effects or CG, most are ok bordering on ""iffy"" while the rest are just at a student learning level of quality, that is piss-poor. Some of the ship de-fects would not even be up to video game standards.

But that is about as good as it gets. If all the acting/writing was as good throughout as it was here, you could be a bit more forgiving towards the CGI.But damn that CGI. I can look past the planes.. the sharks.. but when your ship looks dodgy half the time. That's poor. 40m USD on the budget, should be doing better. A small bit I noticed was near the beginning as the ship is leaving, it sails under the Golden Gate bridge, but it seems they forgot to do any effects for the ships wake. That's taking the term smooth-sailing to a new level.Acting in general.. fine, average, meh. Completely middle of the road. The story deserves better. But if you just want a fun Nic Cage film, it's not quite bad enough. It's a shame either way. The best probably was Yutaka Takeuchi in his 5 minutes of screen time. Although I do appreciate the scenes onboard the Japanese sub, that they actually had the actors speak Japanese. Wish more War films bothered to actually do that. Gives it a little more authenticity.As for subplots, you've seen them all before. And done better. The writing for the characters was generally weak, you probably won't care for anyone as they are all so cliché. If you like historical dramas it may be worth checking out anyway, you get the meat of the story. Just don't have too high expectations for much else."

That said, this film is just horrendous. I love a film and consider myself slightly knowledgeable I also feel I have a working knowledge of the subject matter. I am however no historian. 
I must admit I actually gave up on this film and walked out within the first 30 minutes.
I'm not going to go into specifics as I don't want to cause any spoilers.
Save to say, blatant mistakes which can only have been included to increase the Hollywood drama/action effect, I hope that's the reason if not then it suggests people involved actually couldn't be bothered to do it right and were more interested in how much money they could make.
CGI quite simply awful. Acting way below par!
I'm sorry this is so negitive but this is truely one of the worst movies I have ever seen considering I managed the entire Twilight Saga curtesy of my wife.

" Awful and disrespectful.
",-0.4588,-0.986,2018-07-02 00:00:00,3,"This film fails on so many levels it's actually embarrassing. In an attempt to honor US sailors who served on the USS Indianapolis during the second world war (at least I hope that was the intention) the filmmakers instead dishonor them by making a movie that feels cheap and at times even silly. With a culmination of bad effects, bad acting, bad camerawork, and bad storytelling, it made me feel sorry for the actual people this story was based on for the fact that their story has to be told through this awful piece of cinema.With a budget of $40 Million, its shocking how abysmal the CGI is. All the action in the film is computer generated and hideous, looking more like a commercial for War Thunder ( a video game about military ships, planes, and tanks) than a scene from a multi-million dollar movie. Making you realize that if they couldn't afford to film any actual ships or planes (or at least hire a better effects studio) THEN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE THE FILM IN THE FIRST PLACE! Aside from the ship, animated fire, and decent to cheap looking props ruin any immersion the film attempted.The acting also tarnishes much of the movie's believability as much of it is either mediocre or feels lazy. This is especially true when referring to Nicolas Cage who feels like he's asleep half the time, and considering he shares a majority of the screen time it makes the entire experience painful to watch. You'd believe that a film based on a true story would feature a lead who cared more about his part, but it feels that Cage is just doing the minimum to receive his paycheck and not actually into his character WHO IS BASED ON A REAL HUMAN BEING! The other actors in the film are either good to passable but considering Cage appears to be a selling point for the film and in most of it, he undermines any good performances.The cinematography is another witness to the film's cheapness. With awful closeups and shots that films students could do better (since at least THEY know how to put the camera in focus), the movie feels like it only as 1/40th of its own budget. Granted 40 million is not as much a many other films have, if it had been used competently, then the movie might have been much better.And out of all the negatives, one of the most shameful, horrid, and down right worst parts of the movie is its writing. Every single bit of dialogue is terrible and incredibly difficult to listen to. Anything trying to be sentimental comes off as cliche and stupid, to the point where it feels that the writer spent a week watching classic war films and wrote the script based on everything he could remember by heart.It truly feels terrible to think that the real serviceman this film claims to be portraying have not been done justice by this film. Even though their story almost certainly deserves it. If you wish to actually watch something good about the USS Indianapolis and her men, I suggest watching ""USS Indianapolis: The Legacy"" a documentary that actually does right by this story.(Even ""Mission of the Shark: The Saga of the USS Indianapolis"" is better.)"
" Surprisingly bad acting

On the contrary, this must be without a speck of a doubt the worst perfomance and lame acting of Nicolas Cage and Tom Sizemore. It is just appalling. Just painful to watch."
" Good God...what have you done? Geeeeeeeez
",0.4404,-0.9179,2018-05-03 00:00:00,1,"The screenwriters, the producers, the entire cast of this schlock piece should be rounded up and escorted to the brig and interrogated one by one as to who ate the strawberries from the ships' ice cream stores. Oooooops. That is another movie entirely, The Caine Mutiny, a truly classic movie on every level.
This movie. Oh God help us. This movie. This is quite possibly the stupidest movie ever made. I can see it now. Hollywood aging rat pack producers bang on Cage's mansion door and beg him to salvage this ""treatment"" of a script. 
""Please Nick. Please rescue us from this shipwreck. We'll pay you anything. We know your careers is in tatters. We know your desperate. We know you need the cash. Please. Please. Pleeeeeeeze!
Nick stares at the ceiling from his lazy boy. ""Sure, I'll do it, boys. But, you'll need to supply me with the proper amount of blow before I commit to such a venture""
From inexplicable beginning to absurd end, the movie meanders like a deaf, dumb, blind man trying desperately to make sense of the senseless. They didn't even bother to get the CGI even close to real. Who cares? They didn't even bother to get the dialogue into semi coherent shape. Who cares? Gee whiz. They didn't even bother to press the uniforms. Anybody who spent two seconds in the military knows for darn sure that the anal retentive navy always has to have those damned uniforms pressed to a crisp at all times, even before they are right about to be blown to hell from a Japanese torpedo strike.
Seriously, this movie is a direct insult to the hundreds of brave men who actually did die a slow, vicious bloody death in the waters of the Pacific after delivering the bomb. Their suffering and bravery gave meaning to the word, hero. And Captain Charles Butler McVay III, the actual captain of the Indianapolis who was made a scapegoat by the Pentagon and politicians saw his life destroyed after this tragedy at sea. He took those bogus court martial trials like a man, with quiet nobility. The families of the dead sailors mailed him death threats for decades after that. They repeatedly called him to threaten his life many times. He suffered quietly through all of that hell. Then one day in November, 1968, he walked out into his front yard, holding the doll of a toy sailor in the left hand, given to him as a child and a pistol in the other hand and shot himself. 
These real stories of heroism, nobility, and true courage are paid a deep disservice by this horrible movie. The real story of the U.S.S. Indianapolis is heroism at its finest and most legendary. You men will always be remembered by those who are committed to knowing their history and the truth."

If people actually researched movies rather than just watch them, it might help this title.
Most of the 1-3 star reviews are all crying about the horrible CGI.THIS IS A LOW BUDGET MOVIE...WTF DO YOU EXPECT?
As soon as i seen Mario Van Peebles was the director i instantly knew this would not be a AAA title.I think this movie cops so much flak because half of the people reviewing it expect it to be transformers or a top notch CGI filled shark fest.Just because Nick Cage stars in a movie, does not mean is a big budget movie. 
I'm kinda neutral when it comes to Cage, but i thought he honestly done a good job. He was given a role and he played that role like you would expect him to.The story is pretty factually correct. Typical American government willing to sacrifice their own people with the purpose of hiding the damning truth. If you're interested in the story and don't need your typical AAA CGI effects. This is a pretty decent movie and well worth the watch.
Sure it's not a masterpiece, but it's certainly worth more than the 1-3 stars a lot of CGI idiots gave it.For the budget these guys worked on, it was pretty decent. There are like 2-3 scenes in the entire movie that have horrible CGI and all of them were when sharks were leaping out of the water to attack. I got over it, i knew the budget & therefore it did not worry me.People on this site really need to grow and learn how to review titles based on their merit.
You cannot compare low budget movies with likes of the hobbit, which got a rating of 8 stars. Consider if you have read the book of the hobbit, how horribly they replaced the real story for a pathetic elf/dwarf love story with CGI going through the roof.
Anyone who had read the books would not rate the movies more than 6-7 out of 10.
Why does it sit at 8 or above? 
Because of all the stupid CGI addicts, that think CGI is preferable to a good story.When rating a movie, please, please use your brains. Allow for a low budget or if low budget is not your thing. Just do not watch it or review it please. You guys are ruining reviews for the rest of us.Focus should always be on
A. The budget.
B. The Story
C. Music/Atmosphere
D. Acting
E. CGIThere are more aspects, but for now all you scrubs please stick to these 5 points. NOT just CGI..This was a pretty good movie for the budget.

There was this added part of the story where 2 sailors were in love with the same girl. I honestly think that added parts make a movie worse. In a movie we need the original story not some added things and a title to make a movie. Other movies like these have better reviews because it was faster and better. I rate this movie a 6/10 because the Special Effects, the SFX and the decor were pretty good. So was some parts of the story."

As watching the film, one can tell how much effort they put into the film as though it did seem more than a straight to video film. The budget appeared to be there and there was some decent interactions and many characters. Nicolas Cage plays the lead but there are plenty or supporting actors. The film isn't as bad as some critics are claiming but not very good either. It doesn't become too interesting until late midway and remains at a certain point for a while, as the Navy crew are stranded in the ocean for over 45 minutes. Many cliches and bad jokes in the film. It is also quite long in runtime and moves slowly at first, and doesn't offer much suspense or thrills as this film should have given the real life nature of what occurred. Perhaps with better writing and more poignant direction, this could have ended up being a great film."

The acting isn't bad, the script and horrible inaccuracies sadly are too much to ignore. At one point I thought I was watching every war movie combined into one enormous turd. A 3 way love affair like pearl harbor, a gunho take no prisoners officer like platoon or full metal jacket, Nick cages character seems like the same one from windtalkers.This movie made me watch pearl harbor with Ben Affleck just to see a better movie (I hate that movie). Yes it's that bad that the worst war movie ever (pearl harbor) looks great compared to this. There are also so many inacurracies I couldn't believe it. Some of the dialog is from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Then there's the shark scenes, my god in heaven what 10 year old from YouTube did they hire for those special effects!? Wrong species, and I swear in one scene it was the shark prop or footage from jaws. These men that served on this ship deserve a lot more than the crap you dropped in the toilet, videotaped, and sold. Horrible movie at best, I feel bad for the actors having to say those crappy lines.

" Not really that bad...
",0.0,0.9024,2018-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Well, I don't think this movie was quite as bad as some reviewers are making it. I do agree that the direction left something to be desired. Some of the early part of the film was a little sloppy. There were short scenes that seemed to come out of nowhere, and didn't seem to have anything to do with the flow of what we were seeing. As a former military man, I was astonished to see a scene where Nicolas Cage wore a mis-matched khaki naval uniform. Never happen, folks. However, I thought the movie got a little better as it went along. I was very disappointed that race had to be inserted into this. There didn't seem to be any reason why race had to play ANY part in this story. I don't know why so many directors (& producers and writers) seem to feel the need to do this (well, I have my suspicions, but that's a story for another day). The scene of the cook spitting on an officers piece of pie was despicable, and I wondered why that was even included in this. It served absolutely no real purpose. This was, supposedly, a crack naval ship and crew, entrusted with a top secret mission, and a sailor is spitting on an officer's food? But the survival scenes were done fairly well, and it was clear the incredible suffering & tragedy these men were exposed to. I thought the movie started rather poorly, but improved as it went along. I think, perhaps, Van Peebles is lacking in experience, and bit off a bit more than he could chew, but, all in all, I thought it was a decent enough movie. Cage played a fairly stoic, controlled character, but I think that was a good choice on his part. The story was what needed attention, not some overblown character. He seemed to hit the right note as a Naval Ship Captain. The actors all did adequate jobs, and it wasn't exactly a terrible movie."

Any one of hundreds was better directed, more atmospheric, more realistic, and of greater dramatic effect.Poor CGI is much less effective than using models and traditional cinematic techniques. It seems that the greater the budget the worse the results.Even the name is odd - there was no courage in being abandoned and lost in shark-infested water, just terror and desperation. And incompetence and callousness by the US navy.The summary is misleading too - the crew may have delivered nuclear weapons, and perhaps they ended the war. But they were also responsible for the greatest single act of mass murder the world has ever seen, and the most deadly war crime in history."
" A barely competent war story
",-0.3848,0.879,2017-11-25 00:00:00,5,"USS INDIANAPOLIS: MEN OF COURAGE is a true-life story of the sinking of the titular vessel by a Japanese submarine during the dying days of World War 2. The setting is the Philippine Sea, where a bunch of crewmen - introduced via lots of cheesy and old-fashioned character drama, from fist fights to romance, all of it very predictable - suffer firstly the explosion and sinking of their ship, and then being stranded at sea for a week in shark-infested water.The premise is a great one, but Robert Shaw's memorable soliloquy in JAWS is better than the whole movie here. The film is way too reliant on dodgy CGI to depict the sharks, the planes, and the ship itself; the mostly inexperienced cast members come off bland to boot, with only a few old hands like Nicolas Cage and Tom Sizemore raising the enjoyment levels.

Prayed upon by hordes of hungry sharks they wait to be hopefully rescued. Their mission to deliver the atomic weapons that would end the World war was top secret. No one knows that they are missing. Will anyone come to their aid?I think the biggest problem with USS Indianapolis: Men of courage is that the producers of the film just didn't have enough cash to do it right. With a decent cast and a competent director present it must be down to the budget why this movie fails to be spectacular. After all we do have Nicolas Cage, Tom Sizemore, James Remar and the excellent Thomas Jane all involved here. However if you can imagine asking a talented chef to create Beef Wellington but only giving enough money to buy cheap pastry and a tin of corned beef. It's not difficult to realise that the end result isn't going to turn out too well. A story as epic as this needs the lavish ingredients of CGI, practical effects and Set design to help sell it to the audience. Unfortunately this movie has none of the aforementioned.Robert Shaw's telling of the Indianapolis in Jaws is much more suspenseful, gripping and realistic than the 2hrs and 8mins of this entire movie. A prequel to Jaws that has never been made. This attempt to tell the tale falls flat whenever a scene of action is required. CGI that looks laughably bad distracts us away from the decent drama cooked up by the talented actors on screen. Plastic sharks and firework explosions spoil any sense of realism that the actors have tried to muster.Stock footage of Great White Sharks are repeatedly used. There would have been no Great Whites present. Oceanic whitetips and Tiger sharks were the real killers. Shots of the same aircraft doing the same turn are used frequently and the CGI aeroplanes look like graphics from a PS2 game. The lighting of the entire film just seems false giving the interior of the Indianapolis the impression it is merely a fabrication. The raft scenes which are supposed to be filmed way out in the Philippine sea appear to be filmed just off shore of Scarborough beach. Everything looks fake, even Nicolas Cage's hair seems suspect.Another problem I feel is that the audience seems disconnected to the action on screen. If the cameras had been set at water level with the ocean constantly lapping at the lens the audience would have had the sensation of being in the sea with the crew. As the water splashes up at the screen we would have had a brief glimpse at the depths below and the horrors that dwell within it. Instead this film is constructed like a cheap movie made for TV. With a budget of forty million dollars the people involved making this production should have known their limitations. The champagne lifestyle for lemonade money is never going to work when you're putting it up their on screen for the world to see. In a world of 4K and HD, effects need to be done properly or the audience will notice.This movie could have been truly magnificent. However due to the horrendous special effects and the altogether low rent feel of the entire production this film ultimately fails to deliver."

I find it hard to believe, considering the potential wealth and gravity of of the story how poorly it was scripted and directed, one might forgive the CGI on cost grounds alone but Mr Cage did little to convince us of anything other than the one dimensional depth of an animated wet scarecrow. A harrowing story wasted due to a lack of vision and integrity. Let's not forget the impossible double page colour picture of a shark for the period, nit picking I know, but Jacques Cousteau would be turning in his grave."

I didn't), and the excellent cinematography and special effects. Unlike others, I don't expect everything to look 100% real. Come on, people, it would take tons of money to make real explosions, sink a real ship and round up real sharks! I think most of those bad reviewers are just petty. The special effects did NOT get in the way of the story, in my view.There was a lot of meat on this one. Good dialog, expansive treatment, great sweeping camera angles, and a real period treatment to the camaraderie between the seamen before they shipped out. Great color, costumes--for a ""low budget film"", this seemed like a blockbuster in terms of production values.Not knowing anything about the original true story, I also did not have my finger on some Google page, checking facts while watching, but just enjoyed the movie, which took its time and treated the subject with much drama and dignity as ANY war movie.

The war against Japan was still going on. To force Japan to surrender, and prevent an invasion of the Japanese main islands, USA wanted to try out a new weapon, the nuclear bomb. USS Indianapolis was selected to transport the bomb to Tinian and the United States Air Force Base. The ship completed the mission and then left for the Philippines. A submarine from the Imperial Japanese Navy discovered the cruiser and attacked it with several torpedoes. USS Indianapolis sank in 12 minutes. The survivors left floating in life jackets and in lifeboats were exposed to dehydration and shark attacks. Out of 1200 only 300 lived. So finally, this is the movie. The story is the perfect movie manuscript. However, this is a low budget movie. Faked ships and planes was done badly. The movie lack realistic details. It's a bit surprising to see Nicolas Cage in a movie like this. I was tempted to shut it down but I needed to watch the complete movie to write this.

An sharp, full-color, taken-underwater picture of an shark. In a 1945 magazine..First half I did not think much of it. But than after the ship got hit and sunk. And most of the bad decor was gone - managing to look past the not-so good CGI sharks. The movie actually turned out to be okay. The acting was good. The scene's where the men where grabbed by the sharks were convincing (not the sharks, the acting). Though this is also where I meant the movie deserved more.The story it tells is an bizarre one as well. I did not knew about it. The hypocrisy, even ongoing after the war ended in trying to wash some hands clean. Pushing the man over the ridge. And for what.. Also an nice gesture of Captain Mr. Hashimoto in trying to save the face of Captain McVay.All this is my personal opinion. And with the bad reviews I saw I thought I gave in some counter-weight. I love Nicolas Cage in a movie, and this one too. I also noticed that he's in more movies with bad CGI / decor, but I also think he's not in charge of that than. So, a fan here. And as said, I think the other actors in this movie where good as well. On a last point though. And I am just an someone, public, not in the movie-business. But does 40 million dollar gets you this less? Is this misplaced? If so, I apologize.A lot of stuff I get, salary's of technical staff, actors, decor, CGI of-course. Over an period of time. But than again I'm also thinking who's getting overpaid there? I would love to see what a bunch of carpenters would've made. (carpenters / decor builders, don't know the right word) So yeah, from that point of view I get all the people here saying this movie doesn't even deserve two stars. But I think the bad decor aside, the story and acting made up for it. And deserves a watch."
" But as a man, I have regrets
",-0.5023,-0.56,2017-09-19 00:00:00,4,"The film is meant to be a tribute to the USS Indianapolis, the ship which delivered atomic weapons to the Philippines to be subsequently used on Japan. As fate would have it the ship was torpedoed at 38 minutes into the film. The rest of the film tells their survivor story.The end shows the actual people and the people who portrayed them. My guess is that the enlisted men stories were dramatizations. Nicolas Cage was perhaps not the best to play Captian McVay, however when your opening scene looks like model planes on a string with very bad CG fire, you take what you can get. Tom Sizemore did play a good CPO with sea stories and newbie pranks. In spite of it being a tribute film, there is an anti-war message that goes along with the idea dropping the bomb was a bad thing. The men in the film separate themselves from the dutiful military man, just falling just short of the Nuremberg defense ""I was just following orders."" The plot was good, the execution wasn't there. Mario Van Peebles has done better.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Stripper with tassels."

This film is truly a disservice to those that served on the Indianapolis, a heroic story that deserves far better than this trite effort in the telling. The CGI is actually worse than many solo efforts that you can see on YouTube. It is shockingly bad, even compared to films of thirty years ago. That, allied with a script, written in an afternoon by somebody completely disinterested in film making, make this a perfect storm of ghastliness. Perhaps it is not my place to publish a review, as I must confess, I hit the Esc button halfway through, with far more vigour than it is accustomed to. On the upside, the Japanese characters fulfilled their roles admirably, in fact I found myself cheering their efforts to send this whole, inglorious abomination to the bottom."
" Much Better Tale Of Survival And Scapegoating Than Most Of The Reviews Suggest
",0.4404,-0.9976,2017-08-23 00:00:00,8,"Just a few days ago the actual wreckage of the USS Indianapolis was discovered on the bottom of the Pacific, 18000 feet below the surface. When I heard that, I decided that I wanted to see this movie that was made as a tribute to the crew and events. I was completely prepared not to like it and to be regretting my decision to watch it within a few minutes. But having watched it I found myself scratching my head over the number of really bad reviews and wondering where they came from. I thought this was a pretty decent movie. Some people are getting picky about the special effects, etc. - but I found myself wondering if the bad reviews aren't somewhat similar to a shark feeding frenzy. So many people are saying bad things about it, so more and more people just pile on for the sake of piling on. But as the movie progressed I was asking myself the question: ""what's (really) not to like about this?"" Historically, it's a pretty accurate telling of the story. The USS Indianapolis set sail for Tinian without an escort to deliver components for the atomic bomb that would be dropped on Hiroshima within a few days of the events depicted here. Having completed that mission, it was left unescorted and was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. The ship sank, and the crew found itself in shark infested waters battling for survival for days because the Navy didn't really bother to look for them. (It was a classified mission, after all, and the Navy didn't want to really admit that the Indianapolis had even been out there and didn't report the Indianapolis overdue.) The bulk of the movie deals with the attempts of the crew to survive (about 75% of them were either killed instantly in the attack, drowned, died from various kinds of exposure or were taken by the sharks.) I found the story compelling and - in the end - even emotional.Once the rescue is completed, the story turns in its last half hour or so to the search for a scapegoat. The Navy couldn't admit that it was responsible for leaving the Indianapolis unescorted and for its refusal to launch a search, so someone had to shoulder the blame. The choice was Capt. Charles McVay, portrayed by Nicolas Cage. I find myself wondering if Cage's presence isn't the real reason for many of the bad reviews. For whatever reason my sense is that Cage is looked upon with more than a bit of disrespect, and even contempt as an actor. There's no doubt that he's made more than a few stinkers, but then again he's made a huge number of movies so there are going to be some bad ones. This, in my opinion, was one of his better ones. I found him believable as McVay. McVay ends up being court martialled for failure to give the order to abandon ship quickly enough (he was acquitted on that) and for not taking sufficient evasive measures to avoid the torpedo-ing (on that he was found guilty.) As a character, perhaps McVay could have been fleshed out a bit more. The writers chose instead to give us too much backstory on too many of the crew members, apparently to provide some romantic and racial melodrama that could play out unnecessarily all through the movie. That was a weakness. I would have liked to have learned more about McVay's background. What we do eventually learn about the Captain of the Indianapolis is that he was scapegoated - the only captain of a vessel sunk by the Japanese who was court martialled for it. In the end, McVay was stricken with guilt over a number of things - mostly, it was survivor's guilt because he made it but so many of his crew didn't. He was haunted by that, hounded by the press and blamed by many of the families of those who died. It was also suggested (and - whether there's evidence to back this up or not - I find it believable) that he was tormented by his relatively small role in the development of the atomic bomb. In the end, guilt overcame him and he committed suicide in 1968, only to be finally exonerated by a resolution of the US Congress signed by President Clinton in 2000.I thought all that was pretty well portrayed. Cage was good in the role, and although the role was much more limited, I also thought that Japanese actor Yutaka Takeuchi was solid as Hashimoto - the commander of the sub that sank Indianapolis. Controversially called as a prosecution witness at McVay's court martial (the only time an enemy officer has ever been called to testify at the court martial of an American officer) Hashimoto's testimony was actually sympathetic to McVay's position, and Hashimoto later became involved in efforts to have McVay exonerated. Although fictional, I thought the portrayal of Hashimoto and McVay meeting and speaking after the court martial and confessing their regrets to each other was quite powerful.My advice would be to ignore the bad reviews and give this movie a chance. It's not a blockbuster by any means, but it's a pretty solid piece of history and it presents a good story. (8/10)"
" Screenwriter totally inaccurate for 1940's
",0.0,-0.9996,2017-08-21 00:00:00,3,"Fast forward past the shark attacks to the rescues & watch from there to the end. This is the only good part of the movie. Prior to that it is inaccurate & unwatchable shock value with 90's attitudes on 40's sailors. The screenwriter & director were clueless.I saw a much better WWII version in the 70's & was horrified to learn about hundreds of sailors eaten by sharks for days until spotted by accident. Then using the Capt as a scapegoat so the gov't would be held blameless. Where was Truman's sense of propriety & honesty while this farce occurred? Not to mention the misguided families who believed the propaganda & cruelly made this innocent Captains life a living hell. He was also a victim in shark infested water as well as a scapegoat for merely surviving. Shame on the gov't & those ignorant families who stalked & tormented him to death.This screenwriter had no business writing 40's dialogue & WWII behaviors. He was clearly writing with 1990's attitudes which didn't fit & ruined the movie with inaccurate BS. The blacks of the 40's did not behave like punks or taunt whites. Challenging would have been a death sentence. There was a separation between races in the military until Truman corrected it. This movie has terrible dialogue, terrible characters & worse acting with bad story lines from the wrong decade. Stupid stunts like blacks spitting in food & harassing the whites, knife fights, fist fights, gang attitudes. Totally doesn't fit the 40's. Same with hispanics in the 40's. This scriptwriter & director couldn't even create believable behavior of stranded sailors in the ocean without food & water. All of these characters were right out of the 90's & unrecognizable for the 40's as were their side stories as portrayed.The writer & director clearly had no Navy or background research either. The bell bottoms which were heavily starched were designed to create water wings when knotted in the ocean to keep the sailor afloat. This is true. Whether it worked in practical application is unknown. Even the life vests in the film were modern design as were the styrofoam floaters. This occurred in 1945. Not 1995. Clearly, no one did any research. They also forgot the ships were diesel not gasoline. But the director had the crew running around with multiple sailors on fire and explosions as if it were gasoline.This movie tried to cash in on the horror & gore of a horrific historical event. They turned this travesty into a horror movie. Not even close to historical reality. Creative license on a true historical event is unacceptable.Instead of focusing on gory scenes of fires, shark attacks & fictional 90's, the travesty of this horrific incident was the failure to escort the ship after it delivered its nuclear cargo; the failure of the Navy to report the missing ship & intercepted message; the loss of hundreds to sharks and the inexcusable persecution of the captain who later killed himself. Only after his death & the death of the Japanese sub commander who sought to clear the Captains name did they finally pardon the Captain & clean his record. After everyone involved was dead, it no longer mattered.Now I learn the main scriptwriter was a foreigner & a neophyte who has no clue about US 40's attitudes since English is not his native tongue. The director was so spazzed at having Nick as his star that he couldn't function. While Nicholas was clearly not comfortable doing his speech to the ship crew, he obviously had no help from the director or the writers. When one of the crew on the extras exclaimed how well they researched, I nearly fell over. Maybe the shark. The animatronics shark was so real I feared it might attract real sharks or they could mistake a real shark as fake. They should have filmed in a pool. As suspected, the crews main interest was in shark attacks not the story. They also could have saved the real seaplane by using CGI than losing a real one in the ocean. Especially an antique. They clearly chose an incompetent cheap CGI company to pocket more money. What loser idiots they were.Cage was so uncomfortable as captain, he made all of us uncomfortable to watch him. I found myself waiting for Andy Griffith to start saying ""Helloooo"" over the speakers in a southern drawl. Who would hand over $40 million for a limited theater release? That's why it flopped so grossly. It wasn't shown in most theaters except Philippines, Japan & a limited few US theaters.They took one look at the extreme negative feedback & decided to eat the money loss than risk extreme damage to their reputations by distributing this mess. Honestly, would you want to go to the theater to watch a true story of a crew eaten by sharks. Fiction is one thing but the graphic deaths of hundreds of real sailors by sharks in a feeding frenzy is too much to stomach. It probably would have crashed & burned at the box office. The film & script were too terrible to fix.This historical travesty should be known & seen but more as a TV movie or documentary about real life stories than the blood & gore aspect. The true travesty was the failure of our gov't to protect the ship & leave the crew to the mercy of enemy subs & sharks; then savagely convict the captain as a scapegoat to hide our gov'ts own accountability for this atrocious farce. No president corrected this outrage until over 55 years later after they were all dead.Even on a well made movie this tragedy is difficult to watch. Between the sharks & gov't persecution of the scapegoat captain, those responsible should all burn in hell."
" Great story, poor movie! 4/10
",0.3164,0.9937,2017-08-16 00:00:00,4,"USS Indianapolis (2016)Plot: Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage stars in this wartime action drama directed by Mario Van Peebles. After delivering one of the atomic bombs that would eventually end World War II, the naval cruiser USS Indianapolis is torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. Left with no option but to abandon ship, Captain Charles McVay (Cage) and hundreds of his crew are left stranded in shark-infested waters...Review: This is another one of those movies, we're the storyline is brilliant but the director made a right shambles of it. The acting was also pretty poor, and it seemed more like a TV movie, than a film made for the big screen. With that aside, this true story is truly amazing, and I really can't believe that so many of the crew survived, after such a terrible ordeal. Anyway, Captain Charles McVay (Nicolas Cage) leads a crew of young soldiers on a secret mission to deliver a nuclear bomb to Japan, during World War II. After successfully delivering the bomb, the USS Indianapolis is torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, which leaves them stranded in the middle of the ocean, after the boat sinks. With most of his crew heavily wounded, Captain Charles McVay tries his utmost to hold his crew of young men together, whilst waiting to be rescued. With sharks surrounding there lifeboats, and little hope of surviving, the crew bond together through the toughest times of there lives. It is truly an mind-blowing story, which really needed a top director, and top actors, to portray it. Nicolas Cage and Tom Sizemore put in a decent performance but the rest of the unknown actors failed to bring true emotion to such an impossible situation. When you see the real crew towards the end, it does touch your heart but the 2hr long movie didn't do the true story any justice. Average!Round-Up: This movie was poorly directed by Mario Van Peebles, 60, who also brought you the great New Jack City, the poor Posse, Panther, Hard Luck, Redemption Road, All Things Fall Apart, We The Party and Red Sky. Judging by his average movies, I'm surprised that he was given such a big budget to direct this movie, and after such poor takings, I doubt that he is going to get such a big budget again. Nicolas Cage really needs to choose his movies carefully, because he has been starring in one bad movie, to the next. On the plus side, I'm glad that this story was made into a movie, so people get to know about the heroic episode, which took many life's but this movie really didn't get to be seen by a wide audience, so there are many people that don't know about this important part of American history. Anyway, I won't be watching this film again in a hurry but it did make me look into the history of the USS Indianapolis.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $1.2million (What A Flop!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their history/action/dramas, starring Nicolas Cage, Tom Sizemore, Thomas Jane, Matt Lanter, James Remar, Brian Presley, Yutaka Takeuchi and Johnny Wactor. 4/10"

Nicolas Cage is the strong and sturdy captain who is metaphorically thrown to the sharks by his superiors in order to save face.When the sharks arrive the composer cannot resist a few chords of Jaws like music further reminding you of Robert Shaw."

",0.7003,-0.9437,2017-07-30 00:00:00,6,"Years ago I read ""Abandon Ship"" the story of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis by Richard F. Newcomb. It 's not the book the film is based on.In some ways that's a pity. Although Newcomb's book was first published in 1960, it is a masterly account of the disaster and recounted events that are not in the film. I always remembered his description of the strong swimmers who rode herd on their weaker comrades pulling them back when they drifted away until they themselves used up their reserves of energy and drowned - many of the bravest acts of WW2 were not necessarily in the heat of battle.Somewhere along the way, much of the drama leaked from this film.It's unusual these days to see a movie where the special effects are not absolutely dazzling. They might be a cut above the old Hollywood bathtub effects, but the limitations of the effects in this film draw attention away from the story.But that isn't the key weakness in ""USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage"".Although Nicholas Cage gives a fine performance as Captain McVay, and the ending does have some punch, the filmmakers weren't content with what really happened, and added some very predicable fictional elements. Was it really necessary for Craig Tate and Johnny Wactor's characters to duplicate the scene from ""Titanic"" where Kate Winslet saves Leonardo DiCaprio from imprisonment in the nick of time? It's the forced backstories that rob the film of stature.There was no need to expend so much energy on the fake elements. Here is a passage from Newcomb's book describing what happened when Lieutenant Gwinn, the pilot of the PV-1 Ventura who first spotted the men in the water was taken aboard the hospital ship ""Tranquility"" and introduced to the survivors as the guy who found them. ""Men in all stages of recovery, some weak and hollow-eyed on their beds shouted cheered and whispered. Those who could, crowded around and thumped him on the back, laughing and jumping. Some merely turned their heads on their pillows and cried softly, and the quiet, reticent Gwinn himself broke down under the flood of emotion"".I think I would have had that scene in my movie."

" Jaws Meets Titanic in Major Disappointment
",-0.5106,0.8878,2017-06-23 00:00:00,6,"The torpedoing of the USS Indianapolis in shark-infested Pacific waters, during late World War II, was a harrowing tale of survival. Having completed a strategic mission, the ship was officially not located where it was. The eventual rescue was bungled and delayed, which was fatal for many who survived the sinking and resulted in subsequent finger pointing and scape-goating. Unfortunately, Mario Van Peebles's screen treatment of the events is more ""Jaws"" meets ""Titanic"" than a graphic war film. ""USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage"" rips off bloody shark attacks from the Spielberg film and underwater escapes and sailors sliding down sloping decks from the Cameron opus. No need to be creative, when plagiarizing classic films is so easy. Even the Japanese perspective of the submarine attack on the Indianapolis owes much to Clint Eastwood and his two Iwo Jima films.A miscast Nicolas Cage heads the cast as Captain McVay, and he looks tired and old in contrast to his crew of young, squeaky-clean hunks, who play at war on a ship with clean Tide-white sheets and freshly swept gun emplacements. No grime, no grease, no sweat on this movie ship; war is a video game until the fins start circling survivors and the water boils with blood, but even then there is time for laughs, reminiscing, and camaraderie, while clinging precariously to rafts and watching the survivor count diminish. The model work and special effects are obvious and unconvincing, blatantly second rate in an age of state-of-the-art CGI. The shore scenes are cardboard attempts at 1940's atmosphere and costumes, flimsy at best, laughable at worst; hairstyles and fashions are anachronistic; the sailors and their girls perform swing numbers with the skill and dexterity of Broadway hoofers; and the period automobiles are pristine collectors' pieces, all freshly polished and gleaming. Teeth are pearly white, uniforms spotless, interiors decorator perfect.The acting is passable at best, lots of toothy grins, macho strutting, and over emoting. The clichéd use of genuine footage of the rescue, recent film of the survivors, and a parade of old photographs of the victims fail to rescue the film in its final moments, and the ""USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage,"" which cries out for the sure hand of a Clint Eastwood, rates as a major disappointment and lost opportunity."

Considering it starred Nicholas Cage and was directed by ""Stitch Jones"" from Heartbreak Ridge, my expectations going into it were pretty low. I wasn't expecting it to be as horrible as it was, however. Honestly, it's an insult to the brave men who served on and lost their lives in the USS Indianapolis tragedy. The social-racial commentary the writer/director attempted to make throughout the film was inappropriate for a movie of this subject matter, and did little more than cheapen and trivialize an already bad movie. The historical inaccuracies in the film were too many to pick apart here, and the special effects were B grade SyFy channel at best. Nicholas Cage has been in some horrible movies, but he sunk to a new low with this piece of art. All this combines into one big hot mess. If you're looking for ""Do the Right Thing"" meets ""Sharknado"", using the USS Indianapolis tragedy as a backdrop, here it is. Otherwise, skip this one and watch one of the many well done, powerful and accurate documentaries about the USS Indianapolis that are available out there."
" How could a deep water adventure be so shallow?
",0.3182,-0.9532,2017-05-19 00:00:00,5,"This movie spends too much time making up or embellishing clichéd stories about its secondary characters. The story of the Indianapolis doesn't need gratuitous character conflicts to be interesting. This is made worse by the film's tone-deaf rendition of the period; most of the cast act like they were dropped into this movie without a chance to study up on how people behaved in the 1940s. And of course we have the obligatory lectures on modern social issues. It's not that those social issues don't matter; they do, but I doubt sailors stranded in the ocean would take time out from dodging sharks to deliver feel-good speeches on those topics. Cage is predictably over-the-top, but Sizemore seems determined to beat him on that score; the first half of his performance consists of every tough-old-salt trope you've ever seen in a sea movie all rolled into one, and the second half consists mostly of screaming. (Too bad William Shatner's too old to be included; he could have taught them both how hamming it up is done.) The rest of the cast do their damnedest but the script doesn't give any character much depth; just forced, artificial, needless personal dramas.This film would have been much, much better in someone else's hands; Tom Hanks, for example, or Clint Eastwood. As it is, it takes a gritty true-life ordeal and turns it into a slick package of manipulative formula clichés. Too bad."

I want to take everyone involved that was in the production, from the producers to the assistant of the assistant grip, and drop them all into a shark frenzied see thru tank so that the real survivors, and their families, can watch them get brutally drowned and thrashed! We can also throw in any surviving military/government officials who tried to cover up the tragedy and then blame the Captain for it :)Being a WWII history buff and a huge fan of Robert Shaw's beautifully acted monologue in Jaws, I was excited to hear about this feature film. I also just watched the amazon prime documentary which honestly got me all choked up after hearing the survivor's heartfelt tales of brotherhood and valor. Then this piece of shite film comes on!I guess the first red flag was when I saw Nick Cage on the cover kind of like he was on the movie World Trade Center (probably another terrible movie). I really cannot recall him ever being in a good movie outside of Fast Times and Raising Arizona (Family Man was OK i guess). Then, after just watching the first scene, I started mumbling, 'No no no no...Please get better! No Please!,' but it didn't. The rest of the movie was just one bad scene after the next in all facets of film making. I can deconstruct all day, but this movie is really not worth it. I didn't even really watch it to tell the truth. Just skipped on through it. Why? Because it's unwatchable! It may as well be on Mystery Science Theater to be laughed at and mocked! The important point I'm trying to make here is that the brave souls who lost their lives along with the remaining survivors (and their families) deserve a better banner. Waaaaaay better! 1200+ sailors went into the shark infested waters for 5 days(?) and only 300+ survived! Imagine that!!

I finished the pizza, but I couldn't finish this gawdawful movie. Every scene was a travesty -- every single one! How could that happen? One would think Van Peeples could get at least one right by nothing more than probability. To make a movie this crappy takes determination. Maybe he was incensed by having been given only $40 million dollars and consequently decided to ""stick it to da Man"" in revenge. Or maybe he really is as incompetent as this film suggests. Whatever... Don't waste your money or your time. Look for ""Mission of the Shark: the Saga of the U.S.S. Indianapolis"" instead. It's a made-for-TV feature and nearly 27 years old, yet superior in every way to this film."

You'll learn more about the events and it'll save you from wasting 2 hours and ten minutes of your life to this awful movie. I always expect that Hollywood will bungle the details in military movies and usually give them a pass for those. There are SOOO many anachronisms and inaccuracies in this movie though. EVERY scene has something wrong with it. The ship itself, the uniforms, the orders given, the weapons, the lingo, even the sharks. It's beyond distracting. The most glaring example is that they the used a battleship to represent a cruiser. You can have a movie like U-571, which is fictional, and they have more accurate depictions of the submarines and even a German destroyer. Mario Van Peebles is like ""hey, the USS Alabama is located in Mobile, let's go film on that."" ""It's the wrong type of ship though."" ""It's only a film based on true events, accuracy doesn't matter.""On top of that the writers couldn't have stuffed more cliché, trite military lingo into this movie if they tried. The focus they have on the sharks is weird, and inaccurate. The captains speech made me groan out load. Nicholas cage don't ever do another war movie again! If you've seen Windtalkers you know what I'm talking about. Again, if you really want to know what happened to the USS Indianapolis, take 10 mins and read the Wikipedia or better yet go to the library and find a book about it."

Watching this movie will lower your IQ permanently. $40 million budget and didn't even clear $800,00 at the box office. When will Hollywood finally realize that having Nicolas Cage as the star of a movie is a guaranteed cinematic kiss of death?"

Right, the film itself is of appalling quality - cheap CGI and terrible shark representation and attack scenes make this a movie of Sharknado quality. The CGI is so cheap its a surprise they even bothered to make it. Acting is pretty bad as well with no feeling or emotion towards any of the characters. The explosions and scenes from the boats and sub look like they have been shot in the bath. IM pretty sure some of the key facts in the film are wrong as well. I know films makers do this but come on at least get the basics right. All in all - read the book or if you want a film adaption just listen to Quints story in Jaws and save yourself a few hours of utter pap."
" Great Story Sloppily Executed
",0.6249,0.7706,2017-04-20 00:00:00,3,"I ran across this on Netflix and only towards the end of the movie did I realize that this was based upon a true story. And what a story it is! This tragedy has real potential to make a fantastic WWII movie but this version is atrociously bad. The CGI and special effects in this movie is reminiscent of a late 90's movie, not something that is made in 2016. Most of the characters are difficult to differentiate and Van Peebles has tried to shoe-horn in far too many tertiary characters. Most of the deaths have no build- up or dread pertaining to them. A shark will jump out of the water, take a random character I may or may not remember and then that's that.At over two hours, this movie is 30 minutes longer than it should be. This B-plot involving the love triangle could easily be cut from the script. They could also cut this ""2 men of different races learn that they're not so different."" It's been done a million times (usually better than they do it here) and really adds nothing to the experience. Probably the oddest thing about this script, however, is how they shove in the court-scene at the latter end. The rescue should be the climax of your film. Instead, we get an episode of Law & Order afterwards. Why? Just tell us what happened after the rescue via title cards. You use them anyways, the court-martialing would only take an extra card or 2.The only real emotional response I got from this movie was listening to the two actual veterans tell their stories at the very end of the movie. Beyond this, the movie didn't do a good job at conveying this tale."
" Better wet than dry
",0.4404,0.9908,2017-04-14 00:00:00,5,"I didn't think it was as bad as some reviewers have said. True, it is full of inaccuracies (A ship's crew is given orders by its captain and replies, ""Yes sir!""--huh?), and the buddy-buddy-girl love triangle is straight out of an old Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy movie (Test Pilot, Boom Town). Also, the racial politics are 21st century, not of the WWII era, but that seems standard these days. The first third (other than the opening battle sequence) is pretty bad, but things ramp up when the torpedoes land and everybody goes into the drink. The scenes in the water are curiously undramatic, and maybe they should be so; the men on the Indianapolis seemed to have realized that none of their own efforts would have determined their survival: their individual fates were a crap-shoot, and they could be delivered only by their tardy rescuers. Ironically, the one officer who makes an active attempt to save himself and others is portrayed as a blowhard and a brat, and one is glad to see him paddling off into oblivion. Everyone likes taking a shot at Cage, and Sizemore as well, but the lead actors do a pretty good job; Cage is as stoic as Randolph Scott, and Sizemore dies un-peacefully in his sleep after cradling his severed leg like his unseen child. The younger actors, black and white, seem pretty much interchangeable once they're scuffed up a bit. The plot has a beginning, middle, and end, but only the middle is much good. I try not to worry too much about cgi; you know it's all fake anyway, so why worry about it? The actor who plays the Japanese sub commander, Hashimoto, is a class act, and his scene with Cage is very moving. Still, the invented plot twists (borrowing from The Defiant Ones, The Caine Mutiny, The Enemy Below, and I Wanted Wings, among others) are really less intriguing than the true stories survivors have told. Is it possible that $40M was spent on this?"

Who did the director had to provide him any kind of military input Popeye the sailor would be ashamed.Just to mention a couple, in the opening sequence, the Bridge Crew at Battle stations would not be wearing their combination covers, nor would the C.O. have his cool-rays still on. Yeah it makes a cool visual but completely un-real!. Nick Cage needed an 1940's style hair cut. Ohh and BTW if a Water-tight door is so hot, it bbq's skin, you don't go through as that is an indication the adjacent compartment is engulfed by fire...need I go on...The only believable Navy shot were of the Japanese Submarine and even that had problems. Gages on a Japanese Sub would be in....Japanese not English!! and that includes numbers and characters! The movie is hard to stomach and did the real story of the Indianapolis ZERO JUSTCICE!"

Captain McVay and the situation was rolling the dice on the trip to and from and the Navy was at fault.The sharks that got the survivors were not great white sharks at all. Dumbest portrayal I have watched. The sharks that attacked the survivors were whitetip. I am not arguing that the great white weren't there but the story portrayed here is just wrong.So why the 5 stars? Probably what Mr. Peebles was going after is another story of the USS Indianapolis.It was also funny to see the director in the courtroom shot. The CGI wasn't as polished as it should have been ...also not accurate of the period planes and ships.Story was a bit weak... in the movie too. This one would have been better left on the shelf.Also I wasn't looking for a documentary on this but for entertainment a bit lame.
" Very Disappointing
",-0.5413,0.1069,2017-03-31 00:00:00,2,"To be fair I couldn't get thru the whole movie. But it was clear after about 10 minutes that the movie was too flawed for me to enjoy, and I'm not that picky. From the exaggerated bracing for impact on the bridge for a bow impact, to the bad sound, to the contrived closeups when Cage talked to his wifes picture, it was poorly directed, schticky, and over- acted. And I love Nicholas Cage, but unless he got a whole lot better, this was a dog. But as I said, I only watched a few minutes, so if it's a slow day, maybe you can get further. I didn't want to impinge upon such an historical incident with what my instincts are telling me is a docu- overdrama, with a lot of dumbed down and unflattering politics mixed in with emotionalism, i.e. a politically correct re-write of history which I hate. There was a scene where they were discussing the reasons for bombing Japan, it wasn't far off, but the characters were callous and unlikeable. All they needed was a few more cigars and maybe a prostitute or two. I've always been interested in this story, but I guess I'll have to read one of the many books written about it.It's possible that I am wrong, but I doubt it, and as I said, it was so unbelievable and inaccurate from an action point of view, and a tactical Navy point of view, even a few minutes in, that even a non Navy person would have to suspend belief"

They made no effort to learn the true story of the gallant ship and crew or even worse, they ignored a great story to make a senseless travesty. They also made no effort to learn any of the customs and traditions of our great service. There is a grievous error in every scene. I only wish there were sufficient relatives of direct lineage left to sue these people and shame them in court. One of my best friends drove a wounded ship to safety after a series of kamikaze attacks. That brave act was dramatized in the wonderful film, Away All Boats. If you want to see how we fought, how we dressed for combat and how we cared for each and our ship , get a copy. This film shames all who served with honor."

I was hoping that this movie -- with updated Hollywood technology -- would tell the story well and do it justice. But this was just 2 hours of horrible acting, you never got to know the true stories of the survivors. If you want to watch a much better movie, please watch the 1991 ""Mission of the Shark"" movie. It was less cheesy Hollywood shark-attack graphics but still had the same intensity and drama and you actually got learn about some of the real crew and their stories and a lot more facts! Like I said, you want a better movie. Please watch ""Mission of the Shark"" instead. This movie is an absolute disgrace in the retelling of this tragic event at the end of World War II.

" Worst Historical Adaptation...
",-0.6249,0.2308,2017-03-27 00:00:00,2,"USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage is supposed to be an adaptation about the sinking of the USS Indianapolis after delivering the atomic bombs that are to be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. What it turned out to be was a laughable representation of a catastrophic event where nearly 1200 sailors lost their lives.The script is extremely choppy, and really gives no background on any of the principals. The dialogue is forced and very unnatural, and the language is not accurate for the WWII era. It's an elementary attempt at a story that could have been monumental.Cinematography...WTF is that!? Scenes aboard ship are laughable and the exterior shots, which are CGI, look like they came out of a video game. Once the crew is in the water, it's basically a cross between Titanic and Sharknado...with really bad CGI.I have seen a few reviews saying that the proper shark species weren't used. This isn't really relevant to the story, but this is one part that the movie gets right. Great Whites, Mako, Blue Sharks, and various reef sharks are all found in that part of the world and most make an appearance in this film.Now the Nauseating part...the love story. It's cliché, overdone, and completely predictable.I've seen a couple comments about the racial tension being inaccurate, but this is another part of the movie that is close, but doesn't go far enough. You have to remember this story takes place in 1945, before the civil rights movement, and stories of sailors banding together, regardless of race is not cliché...it actually happened. I heard several stories about this exact subject from my Grandfather, who was a helmsman aboard in a navy ship during WWII.Overall, I would recommend watching a History Channel documentary rather than wasting two hours watching this terrible movie."

Seriously, Cage is making some of the worst films imaginable now since he went bankrupt. I am guessing he is willing to make anything to get money and directors making garbage films like this know they can get him in the cast for probably a lot less money than they used to. I am not really sure how bad films get green-lighted. just don't watch this crap and just spend an hour reading about what really happened, because the real story is quite amazing."

The remainder are more than forgettable, though not sure if this is more the script or the actors.CGI could have been worse(though certainly much better as well).Plot...well as I mentioned the story was great to start with...the subplots are forgettable.Overall it's your call whether you want to waste a couple hours on this one.

Even as I write this, my wife is watching the movie for her first time and its all I can do not to go crazy ignoring it. Nicholas Cage has always been a marginal actor but here it seems hes lost any ability to act. Nothing he does or says is believable. As for the rest of the actors in the movie, they too should have stopped a long time ago. The graphics throughout the movie remind me of late night B movies or something from the sci-fi channel... absolutely horrible. The sharks looked (and acted like jaws) the planes looked like they came from some cheesy 90's video game as did just about everything else. The Indianapolis was a heavy cruiser that the Japanese sub commander thought was an Idaho class battle ship and yet the movie was filmed on the USS Alabama with no changes to make it look like the ""Indy"". Finally (SPOILER) McVay was found dead from a gunshot wound in his front yard holding a sailor toy in his hand, not as the movie depicted in his living room. Also the Japanese sub commander did not speak English and there is no record that they ever met in person. Pass on this movie, pass pass pass!"

They return to San Francisco for repairs and to pick a mystery package, the atomic bomb. They deliver it in secret to Tinian island. After completing the mission, McVay is denied escorts since their mission is entirely secret. He decides to sail straight fearing the Japanese human-guided Kaiten torpedoes. This would later be used to scapegoat him. A Japanese submarine sinks the ship with two conventional torpedoes. The survivors are left to fend for themselves against roving sharks as confusion let the American military ignore their men for days.The historical story is compelling but this movie is bloated. The production looks weak. The budget is probably not that high which does excuse the fuzzy CGI. However, there is no excusing the poor work from director Mario Van Peebles. The sinking could have been epic but scenes with the real battleship are static. Honestly, it looks old fashion. The script is bloated with unnecessary side characters. It should zero in on Nicky Cage and dump the extraneous stuff about some of the crew. The movie is too long already. The budget excuse is viable for some of this but mostly, it's Peebles. He should adjust according to the money anyways."

Let's just say my trip to the facilities to relieve myself were more exciting than the actual film. The animated effects in Sharknado seemed to be more realistic, the explosions made me feel like I was shooting off fireworks at my grandfather's house, and the acting was worse than my cousins middle school play I attended last month. 1 star. Do you know how they make babies cry in movies? They pinch them. That's how they got Nicolas Cage to cry. I could have shot a better shark scene with a paper cut and ice cream cone in my hand at Panama city beach. I could even tell the Japs were bad actors as well and I don't even understand Japanese. At the end of the movie we were clapping, not because it was a great movie, but because our pizza was ready.

My wife and I thought that Nick Cage and the other actors did a good job in playing their parts. I know that Cage has been in some bad movies in the past but this one makes up for it. And I admit that we are somewhat Cage fans. I thought the movie was well made and the FX were well done. I guess if you pause it you might see any problems. The critics on this site have nothing better to do than pick things apart. They paid a few bucks for the movie and less than 2 hours to watch it and criticize a movie which took years to research, write, film, edit, distribute. If you watch the ""Making of"" part with the interviews of the survivors, you wouldn't criticize it. These men went thru more in 1945 and since then than any of you critics could think up. The movie was for these men and how the government covered up things for the government's benefit. I've had relatives who fought in WWII and only told about their experiences before they died. This movie is in honor of all of these brave men. I wish the movie had been widely released in the theaters for more people to see and appreciate these heroes."

The men who served on the USS Indianapolis not only did they're job for their country but also had to get through 5 terrifying days of not drowning and as depicted in the movie Jaws from the 1970's Sharks, starvation, wounds and heat don't deserve a movie like this. I turned it off, went to the library and got the book: ""in harms way"". not only a way better way to read about this incredible event that took place, but also much more intense. Hollywood what have you done to these men, this must be one of the worst war movies I have ever seen. understandable that Nickolas Cage and other actors did they're best, and tried to depict the movie the best way they could.

This Chud Kroeger of Cinema drastically changes moments of the movie that pretend to be serious and pompous into fun. To make things worse: - awful visuals with photoshoped people falling and pain.net-ized fires; - scenes and dialoges stolen from ""Pearl Harbor"" (would you still pan it after ""Indianapolis"", huh?); - plastic acting of other young actors, whose career's been sunk along with USS Indianapolis (well, that was predictable, due to theirs captain personally);The only thing which was real to me were the memories of veterans at the end of the film. And, for sure, the doc. footage of actual saving of sailors. To sum up: if you're into historical dramas and / or American history – this is definitely not the movie you're looking for."

I was very pleased with how it captured the story. I thought it was well balanced and did not turn this into another ""Jaws."" Men of Courage, especially the saga of their Captain is certainly worth the watch. The character development of some of the crew could have been more developed, but considering the volume of these events, I thought there was enough here to give the viewer a solid sense of it's significance.

He's not a bad director (New Jack City folks) but he did an absolutely terrible job here.The editing is terrible too. We see people falling from a boat tilted at 90 degrees - we see them let go of whatever they're holding onto then the next shot is inside the water where they land. How does that work? They should have it all the stuff sticking out of the boat on the way down.We see one shot of someone hanging onto a bar 3 times with three different people, almost back to back - finally the third one we see the guy actually hit stuff - the other two miraculously made it into the water. It's like they shot this three time with different actors and were going to use one and just decided to use all three even though it makes no sense that the second two somehow got to the same extruding bar the first guy was on.We see guys getting dragged off their rafts in the water by sharks - next shot is blood in the water. Huh?This is the type of movie this is. It's short of something you'd find on syfy. Worst of all is Nic Cage's acting. There are some cringe worthy scenes, I felt really bad for him. The absolutely most laugh out loud scene is toward the end when James Remar is telling him about another ship that had also sunk and Cage grimaces and makes a fist in frustration - how the crew was not busting their guts out laughing I don't know.Clichés abound and of course since it's a movie, every single sailor is a model. Everyone in really good looking in this movie (except for Cage and Sizemore) which makes it seem even more phony. The real guys on the ship were of every size and shape - not models.I'd love to see someone really tackle this story in a more professional and realistic manner. This one ain't it."
" History Finally told and an Injustice Corrected
",-0.5719,0.9741,2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"This is based upon a true storyIn 1945 the USS Indianapolis was on a secret mission to deliver the Atomic Bomb to Tinian Air Base in the Philippines. The ship was to go and return without escorts (to handle enemy subs). The USS Indianapolis was sunk on the return and the crew was in the water for 5-days without food, water and with hungry sharks all around before they were rescued. There is a court-martial afterwards. (Whaaaaat?)Most of the movie shows the crew of the USS Indianapolis in the water waiting to be rescued and trying to stay away from the sharks and that was not all that easy. The CGI and camera work were spectacular and we found ourselves jumping more than once when sharks attacked. We see red in the water but there is nothing gory seen. (And that was a good thing)There was too much screen time of the men in the water and let's face it there was too much repetition with these scenes. We could have seen more story in the courtroom later on.I was surprised at the amount of water in those rafts and there was no effort to bail that water out. Maybe those rafts were built like that. Who knows? There were a couple mini sub-plots: two sailors in love with the same girl and two sailors fighting each other on land and need to learn to survive in the raft. But did we care about any of this? Of course not. There was no real character development as the emphasis was on the crew stranded in the water and later the court-martial. Notables: Tom Sizemore as Petty Officer McWhorter; Currie Graham as Capt Ryan a lawyer at the court-martial; and Yutaka Takeuchi as the Japanese Commander Hashimoto who sunk the USS Indianapolis and he gave the best performance. The acting was okay, sparse but okay and it got better at the court- martial (Whaaaaat?) To be honest I was completely surprised there even was a court-martial. The Nicolas Cage Impersonators didn't really have much to go on in here as Mr. Cage played it too straight. (As he should have)The ending is very surprising and it may even make you angry. Watch the statements at the end to see what happened to some of the survivors and how an injustice was corrected. (7/10)Violence: Yes.Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Small stuff only and not much of it."
" An important historical military story that deserves better than this movie.
",0.5719,-0.2374,2017-01-22 00:00:00,5,"""If it works they're heroes."" President Truman is looking for a way to put an end to WWII. His answer lies in the Manhattan Project. Captain McVay (Cage) is tasked with guiding his aircraft carrier and cargo into position. Without an escort and alone at sea they are attacked and sunk. Now the men are stranded on whatever they can find to float on, surrounded by sharks, and questioned by the military that left them vulnerable. This is a story that is important enough to be told. This, however, was not the way it should have been done. The first scene of the movie lost me for a reason I don't usually judge on. Special Effects. The effects looked like a high school student finding Photoshop and seeing what he could do. In a war movie explosions need to be powerful and realistic. They weren't and it set the tone for the movie. There was really no character development and it hindered my ability to care. I feel bad talking bad about the movie because the story is very important and one that hasn't been told before but this was just not the vehicle it deserved. Overall, an important historical military story that deserves better than this movie. I give this movie a low C."
" A true story, a decent movie, horrible computer graphics
",-0.1779,0.8972,2017-01-22 00:00:00,5,"This movie has some things to offer, mainly the true story of the worst naval disaster during World War 2. But it starts out with video game style computer graphics that are way too obvious. I immediately thought ""low budget"" and I was only 5 minutes into the movie. The movie does tell the story, but it meanders through the lives of the men and seems to focus on conflict rather than camaraderie. I'm not sure how to best depict the horror of 3+ days in shark infested waters. The producers did a decent job at it and had some good shots of sharks with the men in the water which was by far, by far, the best computer use in the movie. It's a miracle that 300 survived. Not as horrible a movie as some of the reviews, but I wouldn't recommend this if it hadn't actually happened. It's hard to believe otherwise."
" Complete Insult
",-0.5106,0.3179,2017-01-18 00:00:00,1,"Words fail me to be honest. Mr Cage is a very good actor, has done some very good films and must have a few notes in the bank. So why if you were a successful millionaire actor would you make a film that is so bad in every way all it does is insult everyone who has ever served in the armed forces? Would you not know a good film from complete gutter garbage that looks like it was made in 1982 with graphics from 1975? Surely you would watch it before it was released? If they had enough money to pay a top star like Mr Cage why didn't they have a budget to make a good film? IT SUCKS honestly this thing is nothing more than a joke and a insult it is the worst film I have ever seen in fact i have not seen it as i could not watch it all its sooooooo bad. Mr Cage you should be ashamed for taking the money for making this tripe nothing short of disgusting."
" It could be so much better ,it must have been much better....
",0.4902,-0.9424,2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"This is my first rewiew, but I just had to write something.Maybe some spoilers, but, who didn't ever heard about actual story, watched Jaws or ,,Night of the sharks'' , this whole text will be spoiler... The real story is one of the dramatic life stories, not even during the WWII, and I expected to see the real drama of sailors who survived the sinking , and most of them didn't even know that real battle for life is yet to come...But,what we get is uncreative piece that deserves to go straight to video or TV at the best... A lot of rip-offs of Titanic, Pearl Harbour ,end ,even Band of Brothers. CGI of submarine , torpedoes or shark attack is that dreadful that I don't have enough text space to write about all flaws...enough to say that Hallmark chanel have better produced and edited movies, that bad that was.What to say about the actors, in the movie you have Nicolas Cage,Tom Sizemore, James Remar and Thomas Jane sometimes were solid actors, but their careers are very questionable those days, but what to say when you see Tom Sizemore in this one, and , automatically you're remembering some of his old roles, especially in Saving private Ryan, or N. Cage...you just have to cringe... In this movie you have some moments that can bond you with the situation or characters, but, in my opinion, it seems to accidentally turn out that way, and not the director intended, as I mentioned in the beginning of this text...one scene from Jaws, when Robert Shaw spoke about the real event have much more soul, tension and You bond,trough that one scene that lasts just couple of minutes, with the ,,survivor'' much more than with any character from this try to be a movie...the only good thing is dialogue between Cage and Yutaka Takeuchi,actor who played Japanese submarine comander at the end of the movie.And for the end, Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed for his work on this film.... It could be so much better ,it deserves to be much better....I wanted to give 2 stars as grade, but, trough my writings I decided to give 1 , cause of events that film portrays, bringing the A-bomb to the Philippines, tragedy of soldiers in sea for four days and the life of a real captain McVay trough he's whole life till the tragic death... it must have been much better ..."
" Not Sure About Accuracy, But Enjoyable
",0.5218,0.9893,2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"I found this a nice movie, with good effects and the acting ranged from great to sometimes laughable.This movie was fun and fast paced, yet had good humor and commodore. I am not sure why someone dislikes this movie outside of demonizing the sharks...yeah.....crazy leftist.Cage was excellent, and you did love his character till the end. The movie did have some unbelievable moments, the sharks and some hokey stuff but all in all very watchable movie.I highly recommend, 8 out of 10. Do not left the fake hipster historians detract you from this enjoyable film; it is a fun, entertaining and somewhat heartfelt film."
