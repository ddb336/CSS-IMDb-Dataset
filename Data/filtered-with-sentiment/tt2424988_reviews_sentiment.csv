" Not impressed
",-0.3724,0.25,2020-02-23 00:00:00,6,Movie is too much overdone. Misplaced comedy mars the seriousness. They could have made the movie in a much serious and darker note.
" a great touching movie

" Time pass entertainer, no real depth.
",0.1027,0.9752,2018-11-11 00:00:00,6,"Akshay Kumar's Gabbar feels very much like the popular and loved Rajanikanth movies, where he finds and punishes corrupt people in unique and enjoyable to watch, ways. He pretty much succeeds in doing just that. If you are looking for cerebral cinema, this is not for you. This one is for those who like light straight forward on the face easy to decipher entertainment. Can watch, not a must watch."
" Surprisingly good
",0.6249,0.8728,2018-11-07 00:00:00,8,One of the first Bollywood movies I've watched. And I was highly impressed. Granted there is the OTT action and the escapism from the reality that seems to be in these genre of movies. But the plot and story have. Strong message that resonates throughout the film. Ive highly recommended this to others to watch.
