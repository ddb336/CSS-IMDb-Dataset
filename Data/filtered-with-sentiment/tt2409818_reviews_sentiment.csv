" This Movie Offers Something Or It Would Be 1 Star
",0.0,0.6996,2021-02-27 00:00:00,2,The first 5 minutes of the film is pretty cool and then nothing.I don't know or understand what Wood is doing in this movie!
" Hyperbolically advanced tech and overcomplicated twist
",0.25,-0.586,2020-10-20 00:00:00,7,"Fairly ok for thriller fans, but with tech that's not even close to your dreams. Diabolically sinister and confusing script spends 90% of its time prompting the viewer to think that the main character is a naive techless idiot celebrity fan, only to reveal an unecessarily complicated and douzy cybercrime spy story with at least 3 participant sides in a final twist. Absurd victimhood at its best: If mediocre and bad actors can be subject to such fuss, imagine what'd happen with famous good actors. Many unecessary elements, such as needless conspiratorial explanations - provided because otherwise the script would make no sense to the average viewer. Absurdy advanced tech and computer applications! Even the Army or the NSA wouldn't have such surveilance capabilities, never mind an amateur hack. Relentless wifi data & virus transfer and remote installation programs that provide camera views for just about every secret nook & corner in the known universe? Haven't these people heard of firewalls? GPS tracking and pinpoint camera locations? Does anyone have such advanced tech or is this stuff of dreams? Average acting, with the exception of Elijah Woods. Not much worth watching except as visual candy."
" Surprising!!
",0.3987,-0.1726,2020-07-30 00:00:00,8,It's a fast paced movie that keeps you guessing at every turn. I had watched the trailer several times and wasn't quite sure if I wanted to watch it or not. I've been so sick of being in the house. I can only watch movies so many times that I needed something new to watch. I am so happy that I finally gave in and watched this.
" so soo
",0.0,0.1211,2020-02-20 00:00:00,4,"The cyber-hacking scene was very striking and, despite the fact that the genre is a thriller, the picture cost almost no killings and the plot turned out to be with straining moments that subsequently had a stunning outcome. But here and there, plot holes are noticeable, such as the lack of mention of applications like Utopia P2P, which cannot be hacked."
" Innovative and interesting to a point, but convoluted and ultimately unsatisfying
",0.4215,0.6177,2019-12-10 00:00:00,5,"Elijah Wood stars as a geeky fan of an actress (Sasha Grey) who accepts an opportunity to spy on her via his laptop when he is swiftly pulled into a deadly cat-and-mouse with a sinister hacker.Written & directed by Nacho Vigalondo, ""Open Windows"" (2010) is a crime thriller revolving around computer hacking. I give credit to Vigalondo for the incredible skills it would take to conceive this story and put the film together, but it's annoyingly complex with some ""Why sure!"" plot turns. Yet Wood works well as the protagonist and the alluring Grey has looks that kill.The movie runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Madrid, Spain, and Spiderwood Studios, Austin, Texas.GRADE: C"
" A pretentious dumpster fire of a movie
",-0.4588,-0.5811,2019-11-23 00:00:00,7,"I hate writing bad reviews. I really do. Bad reviews aren't helpful and only serve to make well-meaning artists feel bad about their work. They worked hard on their piece. Submitted for your approval. ""Open Windows"" Overly complicated. Overacted. Overly stupid and in some choice ""nuggets"" of scenes, I found myself cringing from embarassement- you know the feeling, like when your chin gets pulled down to your neck and your face turns red? And yet I *still* gave it 7 stars. Why? It was weird fun and I stuck with it to see what happened next. There certainly are worse films for sure, but not too many ""Golden Turkeys"" like this one."
" Bits of plot around a hole
",0.0,-0.7814,2019-11-15 00:00:00,2,"During the chase with the police before the crash there was at least 1 police car ready to shoot Nick. That entire car with he 2 cops inside disappeared. Any other cop car that was in the chase also gone. Where? ......
I can even let go technology that see through walls. But this is plain stupid."
" An extraordinary and brave shot!
",0.5707,0.7579,2019-09-08 00:00:00,8,He connected the audience with his style with this style of shooting. And this is truly admirable.
" A creepy, terrific 70-minute movie that goes on for 100 minutes.
",0.4767,0.9926,2019-07-16 00:00:00,7,"For most of its short running time, Open Windows is riveting. It involves a nebbishy guy who runs a website creepily devoted to an actress who finds himself pulled, step by step, into and insane and disastrous crime.The movie begins on Nick's (Elijah Wood) laptop. He is messaged then given intrusive software that allows him to spy on the actress. As the movie progresses he gets in deeper and deeper; he is complicit for taking that first step but then is simply caught.The film is cleverly shot entirely through screens open on the laptop. I'm not sure how this would work in the movie theater but it works great on TV.The movie was written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo, who specializes in elaborate twists, but after digging himself in deep in the first hour he can't find an elegant way to dig himself out again, and the last part of the movie is a long, convoluted mess that is like he was trying to get every twist ending he could think of in one movie.I loved most of this movie, and would have rated it a 9 if it had all been as good as that first 70 minutes, but the last part is maybe a 5 or 6.A final note: this would make a great video game. There's a fairly obscure adventure video game called The Experiment that involves doing everything through security cameras, and I would love to see something similar done with this.Anyway, if you're a fan of Nacho, check it out. For all its issues it's pretty entertaining overall."
" my notes
",0.0,0.5994,2019-06-25 00:00:00,5,"Interesting and intriguing, well done in a lot of ways. but in the end it was too convoluted and didn't make sense. it tried to do too much. Also terrible acting by Sasha Gray. if they found a way to make it make sense, this could've been a great movie (1 viewing)"
" Cool idea........
",0.3182,0.0772,2019-06-16 00:00:00,5,Bad ending. Confusing and headache inducing. Sasha grey can act. Well I might add. The movie seemed too focused on tech and not on the human side. And to be honest the ending sucks. I have a headache now.
" Has a SVU feel
",0.0,-0.8371,2018-12-05 00:00:00,5,"More suspense then horror. Shouldn't be classified as horror at all. This is a ""who done it"" type movie. I won't lie , it kept me watching."
" Absolutely dire.
",-0.5095,-0.5848,2018-07-09 00:00:00,4,"This movie was seemingly written by an 8yr old. The premise is ridiculous. The dialogue is like something lifted directly from a Scooby-Doo script then delivered in the style of a Batman bad guy. If you're about to watch this movie online, do yourself a favour... close that window!"
" Decent
",0.0,0.8955,2018-05-07 00:00:00,6,Pretty good voyeurism thriller. I had to watch it when I saw Sasha Grey was in it (I'm sure that's what the studio had in mind). I do prefer and recommend you check out her other work on redtube.com. Now those are 10 star performances!
" Wider
",0.0,0.4767,2018-04-26 00:00:00,4,"Nick Chambers (Elijah Wood) wins a dinner with his favorite movie star Jill Goddard (porn star-Sasha Grey). To his dismay the dinner has been cancelled. Nick is befriended by an on line hacker who shows Nick film from her phone and computer, essentially spying on her. The voyeurism, on which the film was hyped was short lived. Nick is drawn into a web of activity which centers on a mysterious man called ""Nevada.""Sasha Grey shows us her boobs, something she has done in every movie I can think of except one. The film has us looking at a computer screen (open windows) for much of the film. And what was with taking black and white photos of a screen shot?"
" The night of the battle of the hackers!
",-0.4389,0.966,2017-11-14 00:00:00,6,"I have been longing to watch this film since it was out, only now it had happened. There are not many hacking film that could satisfy thoroughly. Well, I haven't found as impressive as the recent 'Who Am I'. This film was more like partially a found-footage type. Everything was from webcams and phone cams. Not exactly truthful to the reality. Even people with basic knowledge about computers would know that. But entertainment was there. I enjoyed it, mainly because of the speed and being an edgy.Well, a contest winner is waiting in his hotel room for his dinner date with a celebrity in the later night. While he was updating his blog, someone hacks his computer and gives more contents for the blog than he had thought of. But soon it all plays out differently. Now he's the hacker's puppet, and must follow everything he says or the consequences would be serious. How far it all goes and how it all ends are the remaining story to tell us.As I said not the best in this theme, but watchable film. Everything was a one night event. Slowly started and then picked up the pace before ending on a high. The end was not good, the twist. At least that's how I felt. Should have been better, yet acceptable. Elijah was good. I just checked it out after seeing his nice act in his latest Netflix film. The rest of the cast was fine too. A Spanish film in English language. Soon I'm going to check out the 'Colossal' from this same director. So it is a good time pass film and you might enjoy it as I did.6/10"
" Friended
",0.4019,0.9558,2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"Released in the same year as 'Unfriended', though not as widely seen, 90% of the action here likewise takes place on a single laptop screen with the camera darting between various open windows (hence the title), including a webcam of the protagonist. It is a very well paced movie and one that offers further proof of the ability of a single laptop screen to create a riveting thrill ride. Little can be revealed of the plot without ruining a fresh experience, but suffice it to say that it focuses on a nebbish who receives an invitation to spy on a famous actress through his laptop and then has trouble preventing a planned kidnapping without convicting himself. As such, 'Open Windows' plays into some interesting dilemmas faced by computer users in the voyeuristic era in which we live. At the same time though, the film mounts such a series of ludicrous twists (especially in the final fifteen minutes) that the convoluted nature of the plot detracts from the novel laptop screen format. And in terms of the laptop screen format, 'Unfriended' plays better into the anxieties that we all face when the internet or our computers do not work properly, however 'Open Windows' certainly puts a new spin on clicking on links from non-trusted sources. It is a decent enough thriller, but it is easy to see why the tighter scripted 'Unfriended' has found a larger audience over time."
" Long, boring, tedious
",-0.3182,-0.9533,2017-08-02 00:00:00,3,Started out okay but about 20 minutes in became a long involved not so fun exploration. Not very thrilling. What am I watching and why. Waste of an hour and 40 minutes following who is chasing who for ineffective twists that don't work well. Reality meets the web or whatever and real life consequences don't really matter.
" Open Windows
",0.0,-0.8754,2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"The plot is about a B-Star Actor Jill Goddard (Sasha Grey) who is tired of the business she's in and wants out. But feels trapped by her friends and management. Here enters Nick (Elijah Wood) her number one fan who runs a website dedicated to her. After winning a competition to have dinner with her he is later disappointed when a person alleging to be her representative says she cancels the dinner date. Her manager, then gives him the ability to view Jill secretly via her computer and phone. Little does Nick know that he is about to enter a sinister game of cat-and-mouse where nothing-and no one-are what they seem.Described as a 21st Century Rear Window that boasts that it is a unique film that has never been done before. Sadly, it is neither a modern version of a classic nor unique. Yes, voyeurism links both films, but really, that's where the similarities end for me. However, that does not necessarily make this a bad film. In fact, it's pretty a compelling thriller for the first two acts, and then it loses its steam and plausibility by the third act as it takes on an unnecessary Science Fiction element that makes it go a little over the top in my opinion and kind of slightly spoils the ending and the film overall. Although I had a good time watching it. Woods and Grey performances are good, although the former comes off a little pathetic and easily to manipulated at times. Which makes it hard to root for him as he keeps making one bad decision after the next. This isn't a must watch movie for me, but if you do watch it, then I think you will have a good time too. Just don't go into it thinking it's a 21st Century Rear Window because it's not."
" A highly captivating Psychological thriller, fantasy
",0.1689,0.9781,2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"The movie begins well and captivates your attention quickly with a clear emphasis on drama and the unexplained or expected. It somewhat surprises you and sets the background for the movie well. The main part of the movie is nothing like the beginning. It gradually builds the tension and keeps your heart racing as a good thriller should although is clever enough to not neatly fit any genre really. For this sense of adrenaline the film length is great as it leaves you wanting more and never bored. From the review ratings I have read they seem a little low for my own enjoyment of this film. It is definitely worth a watch for any sci-fi fan looking for a captivating and thought provoking movie. Do not panic about the intellect necessary to understand this film however, since it is certainly easily understandable unlike some films with a slight psychological emphasis. Whilst the film engages you thoroughly for a clever ending the ending for me was a little flat and didn't do the beginning any real justice. It could have been more believable which is a shame since for me this movie would have been very close to a top rating had this and the beginning been sharpened up a little. On the whole ... Dramatic, thought provoking movie which caters for the genre focused adult masses well. Definitely needs an appropriate age rating due to content but does have a wide audience appeal. Worth a watch. Don't miss and you won't be disappointed."
