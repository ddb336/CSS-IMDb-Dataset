" Too many cliches and too much forced melodrama.
",-0.4588,-0.9792,2021-03-25 00:00:00,6,"Great special effects and action. But the movie tries too hard to be super melodramatic.The audience has seen too many movies like this to have their jaws drop at the possibility of the threat being the possible end of the world --- again. And I would assume the characters in the movie have seen it too many times also, to be acting like the extinction of humanity has never been imagined before. Most of the audience is just going to roll their eyes and wave it off as ""seen it too many times already"".Experienced military is used to death, destruction, and risking their lives. They don't freak out everytime somebody dies, or they lose the advantage. Too many instances of battle tested soldiers wide eyed, jaws dropped, and screaming ""What are we going to do !!!""It doesn't make sense the soldiers would be so unsupportive of a scientist --- who works for the company who designed and built much of the equipment and weapons that have both given them the advantage on the battlefield, and never failed them --- for no reason. It's an insulting cliche to insist on painting soldiers as always too dumb to understand or respect science and technology. Even though they are using it everyday.And it's illogical the little boy who spent the whole movie cowering in his older sister's arms, would just stroll out into the middle of the battlefield, with an active firefight going on all around him, to retreive some cheap trinket. And then just stand there while everyone is screaming, ""No, come back !!!"" Just a plug in cliche attempt to be melodramatic."
" Great and creative until the end
",0.7906,-0.4588,2021-03-22 00:00:00,6,An interesting movie until they tried to justify mass murder at the end for zero reason.
" Surprisingly good sci-fi.
",0.6249,0.9562,2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I generally find sci-fi to be hokey. This was surprisingly taut the whole way through. By that I mean that it had lots of well crafted action, while the story line was loud and clear without long drawn out dialogs. Maybe it simply caught me on a good day but I was impressed. If you liked ""Outside the Wire"" then you'll like this just as well and vice versa."
" Dont listen to the closed minded idgets!
",0.0,-0.6273,2021-02-21 00:00:00,10,This is 5 years later and I have watched this movie several times. The critics calling it trash dont even like or watch scifi. Pay no mind to those idiots. If you like action and a good story watch this film.
" A unique concept, the ultimate weapon, a very good recommendation for the genre
",0.2484,0.9417,2021-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Fiction/action/war movie. We are being transported to Moldova where civil war seems to have broken out. The U.S. already has some forces there and is sending one of the leading manufacturers of military equipment as well as vision devices to the spectrum beyond the visible, to help them with an unusual find. Some blurry manifestations, visible only in the spectrum beyond the visible, wipe out the soldiers there one by one. Rumors in the area call them ghosts of war. Other theories speak of the enemy's special camouflage. What are these manifestations really? The only thing that is certain is that they win and conventional weapons have no effect on them, they will need to solve the mystery first so that they can fight them. A pretty good film of its kind, with an original idea, set with more experienced actors, better directing and perhaps more effects could become very powerful. Recommended as it escapes the moderate and the usual."
" Overrated
",0.0,-0.7969,2021-02-13 00:00:00,4,"It could have been a decent film if the plot was better developed. The first 20 minutes was a total waste and the movie should have started with a proper introduction. The battles that followed were okay but it was a matter of the blind leading the blind with no real tension. For a cheap movie, not the worst sci-fi thriller. The dialogue throughout, however, was weak and the movie only qualifies for a star rating of four for mild entertainment."
" FICTIVE SCIENCE
",0.0,0.7851,2021-02-08 00:00:00,6,"Decent way-out ""science"" fiction, distinguished from the pack by it's classical European setting. I hate cgi, so big problem for me. but not most, I'm sure. For cgi it's pretty good, even for me. Actors really put it across, all good"
" MacGyver parody scene was amazing.
",0.5859,-0.8934,2021-02-04 00:00:00,5,A supergenius MacGyver dude in a moment gets the whole plot and the mystery out of nothing because why not. Then he takes parts of pcs and some other broken junk to make super duper plasma something guns for everyone to go and kill the enemy ghost things.This scene alone was priceless.Rest of the movie not so much.
" Video game movie
",0.0,0.9633,2021-02-01 00:00:00,6,"This movie is a videogame. I'm laughing at some.od the reviews here. I'm.aure the people bashing it probably love Transformers and Fast & Furious. Give me a break. Did you expect good science and plausibility?
Great special effects and action. I hope they make a videogame based on this as it would be fun!"
" Good action entertainment
",0.6908,0.6124,2021-01-19 00:00:00,7,"This movie had decent action and I found it entertaining. You have to overlook some of the science plot holes and the acting is a bit hokey. However, it's an action/adventure/sci-fi...and it performs well in that category, overall."
" Science fiction with a dose of believability
",0.0,0.9631,2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,"This is one of those ""stop the insurgence or humanity will disappear"" movies. The premise and solution to the attack is fresh approach that is mostly believable. The one issue difficult for me to buy is the development and building of the necessary weaponry in a single evening. As a retired engineer myself, I know for a fact that the task is would take weeks, not hours.
However, I still found this movie to be entertaining, clever concepts with the screenplay moving well start to finish. There isn't much in the way of heavy social posturing, but there is a closing action that will prompt a little moral thought.
The character development was adequate, acting pretty was good given the requirements of the storyline. There are a few faces you will recognize that gives the cast some credibility.
When the movie ended, I felt that satisfaction you only get with films you are glad you watched."
" The worst piece of garbage I have ever watched
",-0.6249,-0.985,2021-01-08 00:00:00,3,"The first scene is ok and kind of interesting with the main character inventing some kind of laser to evaporate water.The rest is awful. It is covered with bad acting, badly thought out dialogue and plot thought out over a coffee break. I wouldn't even mind all of that if just anything made sense. But sadly the movie goes from one outrageous explanation to another. I would almost have preferred that they blamed it on magic instead of trying to sound scientific.If you are watching this or thinking about watching this despite the bad reviews just for an interesting sci fi explanation to a weird fenomenon, Don't. You will be severely disappointed and dissatisfied."
" Beware the ghosts of war.
",-0.5994,-0.9443,2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"FINALLY! An actually original scifi film that doesn't include super tired tropes such as evil corporations or rogue secret government agents. I'm so sick to death of tired, totally unoriginal, formulaic films that include evil corps or rogue agents as their central premise. It's boring and lazy writing.Spectral was therefore a breath of fresh air in what has become a very stale genre! No bond villains, no evil corporations seeking to make money from war crimes or evil experiments, no rogue CIA or KGB agents, just a group of soldiers who are peacekeepers in a brutal civil war that come up against an enemy they don't understand, can't see and can't seem to fight.Yes there are plot holes if one looks hard enough and the science is bunkum, but wrong science in scifi is sadly par for the course these days so the film can be forgiven for that.Acting is generally very good. The film obviously had a decent budget so the props, clothing and SFX are all excellent. Not all the characters had any great depth to them but the good quality acting made all the characters at least very believable from the logically minded scientist to the tough Delta Force team members to the general trying to fight a barely understood new enemy in the midst of a brutal civil war.Spectral is hardly the best film ever made but it *is* made very competently, has a refreshingly original story and is generally well acted. Can't ask for more!"
" To Watch or not to Watch
",0.0,0.8126,2020-12-25 00:00:00,7,"If you are wondering whether to watch this or not being afraid it might be another ""Skyline"", it isn't. This movie is a sort of decent sci fi action flick closer to ""Reign of Fire"" inspired by Aliens/Spirits within. Overall I enjoyed it 1 h 47 min of fun"
" Terrible Premise
",-0.4767,-0.9555,2020-12-18 00:00:00,3,"I just thought the whole 'science' behind the plot was sadly ridiculous. The movie was solidly shot. Special effects seemed decent. But man, the whole premise of the thing was bad. The soldiers didn't stand a chance and really ALL of them should have died. The fact that any of them lived to end the threat was pure cheese. They obviously spent a LOT of money making this and there could have been so much more done with that money. Could have made a really good war movie or something. Ha. 3/10"
" Looking at this is like having a deja vu!
",0.4199,-0.771,2020-12-15 00:00:00,5,"Some aspects are reminiscent of Vanishing on 7th street (2010), and the very concept of portraying a unknown superior attacking force is reminiscent of The Darkest hour (2011). Although the story is not original completely it is definitely interesting. In some parts, the action takes place too quickly and there is still no explanation for the various parts shown in the movie, or the explanation is very brief or poor.Definitely watchable movie but if you are looking for some solid rounded story at the end then this is not for you because it is not like that here. Let's face it, this movie has actually an ""ending"" but all of that somehow isn't shown very well, when you watch that ending its like I switched to some completely different sci-fi movie, actually a very weird feeling!"
" Good mainstream trash
",0.4404,0.0196,2020-12-13 00:00:00,5,"Nothing remarkable, part of netflix's propaganda to create good noise so that you don't run out of things to watch. So you can watch it incase you have nothing to watch."
" One off Netflix best original films

" AVOID IT!!!!
",-0.5216,-0.9485,2020-11-30 00:00:00,1,"Simply among the worst movies I had the bad luck to choose to watch. Rarely have I seen so many bad obsolete cliches gathered, it is like a collection!!!! I had to ask for anyone I know and might had seen it, to tell me how it ended because I just could not keep watching any more, it was a torture. Avoid!"
" I love this film... in the top10 for Scifi
",0.6369,0.9139,2020-11-28 00:00:00,10,"Such a great film, good script, good effects, good storyline..For once a film with the US military that's not destroyed by trumpets, flags and painful 'no man left behind tripe'..How this didn't go to the screen is beyond me, a film well made with nothing out there atm that stands close.Thumbs up!"
" Better than I was expecting
",0.4404,0.765,2020-11-21 00:00:00,6,"Something sinister is killing soldiers in war torn Moldova. A weapons geek is sent out to help. Simple plot, but well executed with a couple of twists. The acting and effects were good, it moved along at a good pace and in general it was a good movie."
" Has rewatching value for Sci-Fi fans, but technobabble and R&D speed are implausible
",0.1779,-0.9237,2020-11-01 00:00:00,7,"Strangely, the movie had rewatch value for Sci-Fi fan that I am, but technobabble and R&D speed are implausible and HORRIBLE. Voltage counter anyone? Bose-Einstein condensate ""fitting"" this??
BTW Netflix DID NOT MAKE THIS. TAKE YOUR STUPID LOGO OFF OF THIS FILM."
" Good father son action flick
",0.4404,-0.5458,2020-10-29 00:00:00,8,"Despite being special ops, they shoot ghosts not people, so suitable for 12 up.The action and plot moves along at a regular action movie pace. Graphics and special effects are used very well."
" Naked Dementors or Ringwraiths VS US armed forces
",0.0,0.5621,2020-10-28 00:00:00,6,Pros: Budget on Special effects was well spent. Sets and production art are excellent. Cast for the most part were good in their roles. No standouts but ok. 10 points.Cons: Lots of plot holes. Questionable science and technology mumbo-jumbo. McGyver style weapon making. A lone female CIA operative only useful as interpreter. -5 points.
" Oh my....
",0.0,-0.8345,2020-09-28 00:00:00,2,This movie is so bad it gave me a headache. Such potential as far as special effects however the movie failed to follow its own far fetched technoScifi logic and lurched from one bad idea to the next. Heavily cliched and USA dogma rich. Not too bad if u want to eat popcorn and not think (at all!). Maybe a good date flick as it will encourage dIstraction.
" Expensive and well made - Character reactions feel unreal
",0.2732,0.9719,2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie, it was very high tech and the futuristic armoury and weaponry was awesome. Character reactions and conclusions to things happening in this movie felt very unreal though. Story would have been awesome in some corrections through the movie.This could have been full 10 star movie for me with some more extra thinking in the storyline. Special effects and props team did amazing job in this movie. Movie looked beautiful and special effects very realistic! That is why it felt bad that the story didn't feel credible. For example it took so amazingly long before characters realised that typical weaponry doesn't work etc. Tens and tens professional soldiers had to die in vain. Characters felt quite stupid and the science woman in this movie were quite meaningless. Adult actors did quite well job, kids did what kids do, they learn to act. But the script, it would have needed corrections.I love science fiction, this movie was enjoyable but could have been SUPERB. Turned out to stay in the mediocre line."
" Not even good for a bad movie
",-0.7101,-0.9736,2020-09-05 00:00:00,2,"This movie just isn't good. The writing is terrible, the characters don't matter, the plot is painfully boring and, to add insult to injury, this movie seems to drag on for soooo long.I can't even recommend this movie for a late night, low expectation, tub of ice cream in hand kind of viewing. It's disappointing to the point where you don't even want to find out what the heck is going on and much less what anyone plans to do about it.And, just when you think it's almost over and you can put an end to the agony of watching it, you realize you're barely halfway through.MY ADVICE: Pick another film."
" What a pointless movie
",0.0,0.0036,2020-08-27 00:00:00,1,"Sci fi flick that is totally ruined by lots of military stuff and lots of shooting, the kind that only immature teenage boys would like. Totally boring. Why the movie industry is wasting time and money on movies likes this is beyond me..."
" Could've been good but went bad
",-0.5859,-0.7476,2020-08-25 00:00:00,1,"Started nice but all went wrong in the end.
Still can't understand why they take the CIA woman in the enemy's base instead of a properly trained seal?
Not worthy at all"
" What a load of tripe
",0.0,-0.4469,2020-08-20 00:00:00,3,"On the plus side, it gives a big thumbs up to the role of Darpa. And it gives a very good idea of a major city torn-apart by urban warfare.It does have a plot, utterly insane but a plot nontheless.The engineer character does a fair representation of 'working the problem'.On the downside, it is a mishmash of technobabble attempting to glue the insane plot together and justify some CGI effects recycled from Raiders of the Lost Ark.I suspect if I say more it might count as spoilers, so to be vague: stock characters, a checklist of inclusions from designed-by-committee script.I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy the film, but for me there were too many flaws."
" Very enjoyable Sci-Fi Action
",0.4927,0.9643,2020-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Exactly what one wants from a sci-fi action movie. Good story, good acting and good action sequences.

Exciting and with many invisible Opponents.
I am very happy that there are two Films that go in that Direction.
If I have forgotten a Film that is similar, I would be very happy to receive Suggestions.
Have Fun with the Two of them ^^"
" Would have been a solid 8/10 20 years ago
",0.1531,0.8516,2020-08-02 00:00:00,7,"Yes, it would have scored way higher than 6 in the pre-internet days. Education has ruined the enjoyment people get out of this old school cliché of an action movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it though, maybe because I wasn't expecting anything even close to hard sci-fi. I expected good CGI and action and decent acting (borderline) and I got what I was after. 7/10 from me."
" Yet another way to quickly ruin a good film
",-0.2263,-0.5707,2020-07-25 00:00:00,3,"The first hour or so is a 7-star film. Then, it turns dumber than Blade II quickly (a pretty major feat) and keeps up that level of stupidity through to the end. Suspension of disbelief is thrown out the window when even MacGyver would be ROFLing at the absurdity of what is going on. Hint: super genius is no replacement for R&D, materials, and power sources! Nice helmet design though. Too bad it was wasted on this film."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.5951,2020-07-20 00:00:00,1,"Do not waste your time on this movie. The acting was terrible, story line even more terrible."
" Gritty military action with some paranormal and sci-fi
",0.0,0.9741,2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,This was impressive for a Netflix movie. The production plays out like a big screen flick. It's suspenseful and keeps the viewer engaged. The paranormal twist is original and well executed. The thing that keeps it from being classic material is that the solutions come way to easily and quick. This made for a wrap up that was less climactic than I had hoped for. Still a pretty good movie.
" McGuyver meets Aliens meets Ghostbusters!
",0.0,0.903,2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,"I saw this movie on a list of ""hidden gems"" on Netflix. It's something old with a new twist ,and it works ! I was engaged from beginning to end. For Sci Do horror ,it wasn't bad. Shows what having a guy like McGuyver who has more than bubblegum and a paperclip can do. The lead ( James Badge Dale , baddie from Iron Man 3) plays a DARPA engineer. Other actors are faces you will recognize like Bruce Greenwood (Star Trek, I Robot) , Max Martini ( Pacific Rim, tv show -The Unit) and Clayne Crawford( Lethal Weapon-tv show) , play alpha male soldiers embedded in country , and something other than the enemy is hindering the mission at hand. Decent FX's and good pacing . With a little more money, and a little tweaking to the plot ,and this could have been released in theaters."

Pretty much an Aliens style plot, complete with a little girl that looks astoundingly like Newt.
A Predator style creature(s) with a ghostly twist.
Star Trek Next Generation style techo-babble and made up science loosely based on actual science.
Gigantic plot holes (he has to sign a waiver to see the big secret, a secret which apparently everybody already knows).
Cliché army dudes.I will say this, the acting was pretty good. The characters, while shallow, were well executed by the actors.
There was some decent suspense.
Effects were up to par.
All in all a great movie to kill an hour and a half on a lazy Sunday afternoon."

It is very cheesy, americany with one of the end lines ""I guess science can't explain everything"" but I mean obviously science could explain the monsters because how else would a science team have made them and how could a machine create them. And also all scientists know that science can't explain everything, we don't know everything and there job is literally to try and find a reason for things science cant yet explain...Though I cannot help but get annoyed at how few women there were, I mean come on there are women in the military (in most countries). There is only one woman and she is the only one without a gun and the one who takes care of the children..."

" Pretty Good Sci-fi
",0.7269,0.9517,2019-12-16 00:00:00,7,"I liked this film. Even though much liberty is taken with the ""Bose-Einstein"" theory (which is real). It has been used in at least a dozen films to (typically) explain time travel type plots in films. Regardless, George Nolfi wrote this film's screenplay. He is probably best known for ""The Adjustment Bureau"" (2011), based on Philip K. Dick's brilliant short story ""The Adjustment Team"" which Nolfi directed as well. ""PKD"" as Philip K. Dick is known, has had more short stories, novellas and novels made into films than any other science fiction writer with the exception of Stephen King. Personally, I prefer ""PKD"". ""Total Recall"", ""The Adjustment Bureau"", ""Minority Report"" & ""Blade Runner"" are only 4 examples of his work. Nolfi made ""Deja Vu"" (released in 2006) which has Bruce Greenwood (who is also cast in this film), Denzel Washington, Paula Patton and several other terrific actors. That's another film which claims to use the ""Bose-Einstein"" theory for time travel (discovered by accident). Regardless, ""Spectral"" is worth a watch."

These are some of the reasons why Spectral can stand with the likes of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and other recent theater-released blockbusters. True, it does commit a few military-movie cliches, such as trained soldiers who suddenly appear to be inept at aiming or firing weapons or a big, motivational speech before the final conflict, but overall it's a well-done, well-paced film. Any fan of sci-fi action will be pleased with this surprising treat hidden under a Netflix label."
" Pleasant
",0.5106,0.9566,2019-12-01 00:00:00,7,"I find this to be an entertaining movie. A nice mix betwenn war movie and thriller. The themes handled in the film have been frequently seen on screen in the last decades. However I found some ideas refreshing. This idea of killing ghosts and trying to rationalize where they came from was good because it keeps the spectator guessing and wanting to see what's to come. There is a build-up to this revelation for most of the film and the pay-off didn't disappoint me. I also liked to see such a film in a new setting (Moldavia) and not in America.
However, a lot of details in the script, in the action scenes and how the characters sometimes react lessen the value of this film.
The CGI and visuals are good. The actors are convincing and believable. The directing was ok with a few good ideas. I would like to encourage this kind of movie because despite being flawed, it doesn't feel like a manufactured product, but rather a personal vision of a 21st Century Sci-fi movie. Thanks Netflix for alowing such a movie to come to life!"

Guys , do your research - read the preface and watch trailer ; if it's not your cup of tea ; don't watch! It's that simple.After watching several episodes of excellent quality series on Netflix / otherwise , I wanted a no-brainer action movie. And I found exactly that.So that's what this move is : it's a refresher , it's a drink of lemonade in a wine tasting run.Coming to the story - there is no dull moment. From the moment go , the whole movie is action packed. It has enough special effects to remind you of your favorite FPS.It actually starts off VERY strong. The first half makes you go 'whoa' to be honest. But once they discover what energy bodies are made of ? Then it's all downhill from there.The end just doesn't justify such a strong opening.It has gaping plot holes , obviously - but these kind of sci-fis always do have them.
As an entertainer , I was thoroughly entertained - 2 empty buckets of popcorn stand testament.Seriously , go with no expectations and you will thank me."

Great post apocalyptic sets and very expensive looking FX. It moved quickly story wise and although they actors did a good job they were most forgettable and of course, expendable. A major problem was also one of the reasons it was never boring....how fast it moved. That pace keeps you interested, which it did, but also leads to many ""WTF?' moments. This thing would have been a better as an 8-10 episode series."

No real people or dialogue. The US is implicated in Europe as "" a force of good"" which is a joke on its one. It's so silly that they refer to Russia as bordering with Moldova or is it Hungary? Either way, they should have created a fictional state at least because this is beyond laughable. Not to mention that there is no back story as to who created the ""phantom menace"" and why.

I found all characters likable and even the ones who were jerks had very valid reasons for being tough or disgruntled. No one was out there being overly dramatic or aggressive stereotypes. Just basic stereotypes I could manage. Lol.SPOILER COMINGThe twist at the end was a little mind blowing for me and I'm surprised that not more people are talking about how they layered the ending. It started with thinking the spectral was just 3D printed spirits but turns out they were full nervous system situations being ""kept alive"" to act as soldiers??!!! Mind blown. No one can tell me they could predict that especially after the scientist had basically stopped the threat by pulling the plug in the one room, they still found more. Good one, Netflix.Over all highly recommended by me."

The acting is brilliant, the effects are outstanding and the story is better than most B Movie Sci Fi films. Yes it is a B Movie, but it comes across as a big budget blockbuster which is amazing in itself. I for one loved the story line and did not see any plot holes or problems with dialogue. Instead I thought it ran at a great pace. Just when I thought it was going to slow down and leave me bored, it started up again and blew me away.

So, you can probably understand the apprehension I had when it came to watching this film. Well, it turned out that I could not have been more wrong because, honestly, this film was nothing short of awesome. As another reviewer pointed out this is the type of film that Hollywood, when it does well, can go really well - not much story, but great action and great special effects. Well, story, I probably wouldn't say that the story was that bad either.The film is set in Eastern Europe, which honestly is a break from your typical Middle Eastern terrorist trope of late, but then again the whole Middle Eastern terrorist trope is honestly so naughties. No, now we are going back to Eastern Europe, and the not so subtle 'Russia is the enemy' again, which honestly opens up so much more for secret technological experiments that have the potential of completely overwhelming a force of highly trained US soldiers - which is what the case is here in this film.Yeah, we are in Moldovia where a totalitarian government has collapsed, but there is still fighting going on between insurgents and rebel forces. Yeah, the US is here, but they are only here as peacekeepers (which is probably a little unrealistic anyway considering that in this part of the world the US are openly sending in their troops to keep the peace, particularly since there happens to be another superpower just over the border that happens to have a completely different interpretation of what keeping the peace happens to mean). Anyway, there seems to be some strange things going on, and the government decides to send this DARPA scientist over to find out what's going on.To cut a story short, it appears in all intents and purposes to be ghosts, but there actually is a lot more behind the fact that they are basically fighting ghosts, but I honestly don't want to give too much away because that would spoil the fun (and I've already had some shows spoiled because I have accidentally read ahead while trying to find out other things). In a way though, this film did remind me a lot of Black Hawk Down, but with a much more supernatural element to it than the previous film, which was just American soldiers killing heaps of Somali's, and somehow managing to survive the encounter.Well, it felt like that in part, that is until I realised it was a little more than that, and in whole 'let's get the hell out of dodge' part of the film was probably only about a third, namely because the are actually going in there to attempt to get their wounded back, and also to possibly capture one of the ghosts. It is only when they realise that they are way, way over their head that it becomes evident that retreat is the only option.Yeah, this film actually turned out to be pretty intense, and was much, much better than expected. It certainly is one of those films that will keep an sci-fi action buff entertained for a little over an hour and a half."

James Badge Dale, who was once a soldier himself in THE PACIFIC, plays an engineer tagging along, eager to test out some new lens technology to battle the titular menace: ghost-like apparitions that kill by touch and are seemingly indestructible.The first thing that becomes apparent when watching this is how derivative it is ; the military element feels like BATTLE: LOS ANGELES (with ghosts instead of aliens) while there's a debt of inspiration to ALIENS to boot. However, most importantly, this is enjoyable. The action comes thick and fast and the enemy is quite a spooky presence. The heavy use of CGI comes across well and fits with the general look and theme. The characters are a bit underwritten and thus indistinguishable from one another, but for a rollercoaster ride you could do a lot worse these days."

A scientist and CIA team up to figure out what or who is behind it.This is a straighforward, by-the-numbers sci-fi military movie that might have had a theatrical run if it were made a few years ago. The specifics of the plot are something I hadn't seen before, but the first, second, and third acts are delivered competently--but predictably--by the actors, who are mostly unfamiliar to me (with the exception of Bruce Greenwood and a cameo from Stephen Root). The dialog works in the necessary science and military buzzwords you might expect. The cinematography doesn't break any new ground, but the effects and action sequences are exciting enough to hold interest. The nature of the mysterious enemy creates goof tension. There are elements toward the end that suggest how a movie with a more ambitious message might have gone, but these occur too late to really be developed.Overall, found it an enjoyable way to relax after a stressful work week. I was specifically looking for an easily digestible movie that I could ""veg-out"" to, and it delivered. My rating isn't higher because I use an absolute standard within each genre.

It's your typical middle east war flick paired with a sci-fi movie, and oh my god almost every trope in the book. Let me be clear that I didn't hate it. The rating is just reflective of my objective look at how the film did.Let's start with the lead, Clyne, who is played by James Badge Dale...or as I came to know him throughout the film, poor man's Sam Worthington if Sam Worthington could actually act decently. I don't have anything against good ole' Sam, mind. I just don't think he's a good actor. James and the rest of the cast do an adequate job of acting their roles in this film. That's honestly all I'm looking for in an action film, adequate.The plot is a bit goofy. It starts out slow, then gets pretty strong and intriguing about half an hour in. However, after the big reveal (which is completely outlandish and ridiculous), the film just left me rather...blase. It suddenly went from this intriguing film that made me want to know what was going on to just another action film where we shoot things and blow everything up. Since I watched it on Netflix, I actually found myself browsing Reddit on my secondary monitor during the last thirty minutes or so. The one thing i can say is that the reveal wasn't as predictable as I was expecting. However...there are so many holes in the plot, most of them physics and science base, that it turned me off a bit more. That's not to say that it ruined the film, because I understand there has to be a suspension of disbelief in sci-fi...but I do appreciate it when they do their homework and don't just blatantly make up things that can be proven false.The effects were pretty good, as you might expect from a film of this caliber. I don't really have anything bad to say about the effects, which is mostly why I didn't give it a worse score. Again, didn't hate the film, but I wouldn't watch it again.Remember, think for yourself when it comes to film. Don't take reviews too seriously, because not everyone has the same tastes."

The secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" though in different roles. Max Martini always plays his best as a Spec Ops Operator and one would think whether he is actually a one. Spectacular special effects and gloomy background give the movie a realistic look.
The director has done a superb job with the movie which is fast moving with good combat scenes. The film would bring back a lot of memories to Spec Ops people. 
The only thing I am a bit disappointed is the look of the Delta Guys who seem young and inexperienced. They show lot of emotions except Max. Delta guys usually don't show emotions under pressure. Dale as usual the cool guy and Max always the tough guy give much depth to the film. 
The film has a similarity to ""Black Hawk Down"" especially the end scene.

But one more thing to say, Those weapons modified too fast is kinda impossible... you can say this is just a movie, and this happen only in movies don't compare with reality, but we actually love more reality on movies too...Wanna see this type of movies More ! Please someone convince the Director to make this similar type of movies... Thanks"

The best thing is the plot.It s original.The idea is fascinating.Every scene in the movie happens for a reason.The event happens at the right moment.It gave you the answer that you ve been wondering since the film started. The cast ve done great with their work.Though not the oscar style ,their act can go along well with the plot.The CG was really good though not the best,but it served the plot well.
If you just want something fun to watch and have something to think about afterward,this is the must watch."

" A unique Science Fiction concept
",0.0,-0.9641,2018-07-22 00:00:00,7,"The most impactful aspect of Spectral is its wonderful adaptation of states of nature and materialistic aspects into a thrilling and a suspenseful science fiction movie by the writer and director Nic Mathieu.
The flow of the story merges a military background with an ongoing war with a catastrophically misaligned human experiment with the unnatural and unstable states of nature in the aim of creating mass murdering military weapons.
James Badge Dale as Clyne shines and becomes the main focal point of the film as the DARPA scientist who is confused and carries the burden of responsibility of finding the answer for all the chaos breaking loose on battle grounds.
The momentum of the plot is best kept with enough suspense in the first half of the film where you wouldn't take your eyes off the screen but the second half would slowly become repetitive and kinda exhausting with its predictability.
But, the climax would set things straight in the right way giving a proper conclusion to the chaos.
Watch this film for the director's unique adaptation of unstable states of nature into a chaotic science fictioned catastrophy.
I'm going with 3.5/5"

" Eastern Europe is a mess / But US Army comes to help
",0.4215,-0.9446,2018-04-13 00:00:00,5,"I found this movie randomly on NETFLIX when my 4 month old didn't let me sleep.
As the movie started I checked the IMDb rating and trailer on my phone with my free hand and I noticed it was shot in Budapest. So I gave it a go: my wife, very exhausted joined too.The good:
It was attention-taking most of the time although we laughed on the most emotional scenes.
The soldiers did move / act like soldiers from a sci-fi / near future world.
Budapest looked good with it's fantasy / gaming elements as a power plant / weapons research facility and huge buildings added to it.
Budapest has already been on screen Berlin, Paris, Moscow, etc. - but Chisinau, Moldova? That was fun!
I didn't regret watching it in this state.The neutral:
It was a B category movie. (I haven't seen one for a long while.)The bad:
Acting was terrible throughout (except for some soldiers). Okay, I've just said B category.
One of the key points is a US Army military engineer's conflict that his work that destroys a lot of things - shouldn't be used to destroy human life. Yeeeeep, sure.
speaking foreign language - a mixture of Romanian and Russian (the 2 languages spoken in Moldova, both being popular but you always use one of them with a person and you certainly don't mix the two during the same conversation) + adding Serbian (someone suggested Slovenian) words (why?)
The US Army seems to be on the same side with the elite Communist soldiers against the ""insurgents"": the people of Moldova. Although allies no local soldiers are taken to fight - rather a fragile office woman with no combat experience gets to go. 'Cause she is American, I guess.
US Army soldiers love children who shoot at them from AK-47.
Did I mention that the whole movie's premise was totally stupid?
If you shoot a movie in Budapest, using dozens of the major landmarks of the city - why wouldn't you call it Budapest? After all it's Eastern Europe too, isn't it?
I thought this was a but like a war movie where people will fight (we are supposed to be in a civil war) but it's only the GOOD US soldiers fighting... ...ghosts (?)All-in-all: 4,5 / 10."

" Who are you gonna call?
",0.0,0.9533,2018-03-28 00:00:00,8,"Spectral: Spectral is about American special forces fighting the remnants of government troops during a civil war in Moldova. During the battle, the special forces are attacked by what appears to be ghosts and call on a DARPA scientist (James Badge Dale) to come investigate and help the US Army counteract this new threat.
The Good: Spectral pulls off a neat trick. It is a movie about science and technology and the hard-working scientists behind it. Despite all the hoo-rah action scenes, it is the thinking men that will get them out of this mess. The movie sets this tone well and keeps it throughout the film. The fact that it manages to do this without talking down to the audience too much is an amazing feat.
The solid acting across the board and a solid science fiction foundation are matched with a good pace and good action scenes. The film does manage some very nice set pieces with good practical effects mixed with the CGI.
The Bad: If one goes a looking there might be a plot hole or two. (You need a hundred laser cannons using brand new tech? I am going to need half an hour and some duct tape). In addition if while the film certainly uses science throughout I wouldn't exactly quote some of those theories on Friday's physics exam.
Actual citizens of Moldova can also feel free to criticize the wrong city, wrong language and ridiculous description of your government.
In Conclusion: Though marketed as a Netflix original; Netflix actually picked Spectral up on the cheap from Universal/Legendary who was unhappy with all the science stuff and possible realized too late that Emily Mortimer is not going to open a summer blockbuster. That said one can certainly see the not inconsiderable budget on the screen.
How Universal shelved this film and opened The Mummy is a mystery for another day. Solid Sci-fi actioner with an elevator script sounding like a cross between Black Hawk Down and Aliens. A fun film that is better than one might suspect."

And it's something you have to be aware (if you saw the trailer you already are aware of it) before watching the movie and possibly waste your time.If you decide you want to see this visual extravaganza, then hold onto your seat, because this Science Fiction movie, while not making sense throughout, has a tension level that is high.

I would only point out, being and knowing a lot of engineers, that lots of the ""workarounds"" and quick solutions and gadget reworkings shown in the movie are, to me, too far from reality to consider even in a science fiction context. Sometimes it reminds me of a movie where a printed circuit board that was to control the fire sequence of a magnetic cannon pas split broken in 2 pieces (like a PC motherboard cracked in 2) and the person in the movie held it together by hand and then the cannon could be fired thus saving the crew of the (space) ship involved.

" Some very cool aspects
",0.3804,0.9824,2017-06-23 00:00:00,6,"Not sure how to go about this review without contradicting myself. It's both a very good movie and a mediocre movie. It's a mystery sci-fi thriller. Set in a war where soldiers are being killed by ghost-like specters. The special effects in this film are superb, really really excellent. The specters are brilliantly portrayed with some outstanding scenes of them running through air. The plot is basically the army bringing in a scientist designer of high tech gear to help them identify what the specters are. Although the plot is pretty good the movie lacks a certain depth. I think maybe a stronger cast may have helped deliver some of what was lacking. Even as the film reveals what the specters are it doesn't really disappoint, the story-line is one that hasn't really been overdone in the past. The movie is full of action, a lot of death which is a little overwhelming at times and the specters are relentless. The locations that the film was shot at are very impressive. It is just a shame that it feels something is missing just to make it that level of excellent that we look for in this kind of movie."

Having made up my mind to see a militarysque flick with some sci-fi twist is what I expected, but Boy oh Boy, I was stunned to see the actual piece of work.The movie paced along brilliantly without giving anything away pretty much till 20-25 mins left in the movie. I am not going to unfold spoilers here but the twist is as simple in theory as it is profound. I have not seen anything quite like this and I am a sucker for sci-fi mind benders when it comes to movies or novels. Netflix has totally put their money in the right place and the vfx from Weta adds another dimension to the movie. The movie only lacks in acting department which could have been better, something like what Sharlto Copley did in D9. But having said that, this is one masterpiece that you truly can't miss if you love sci-fi which keeps you guessing and doesn't play the 'Aliens did it' card.

Fantastic flick 9/10 if you are looking for watching a mindless action flick while sipping on Whiskey or Brew.The only criticism I have for it is the continuous oversized Ego of the United States Military. We get it, you have the biggest baddest military of the current age. We know. We are reminded of it enough times. US filmmakers and directors like Michael Bay and those who follow have a huge hard on for the United States Military. Either from this movie or the Edge of Tomorrow some US soldier or Official has to come to Europe to save the Day.Now, we all know that the Chinese market is growing bigger and Hollywood has start pandering to it. But isn't it time we started giving something to the European market as well. The sooner every Hollywood Director takes up the Star Trek model and incorporates an international ""Human"" or ""Earth"" defence force. The sooner you ""Rich kids in Hollywood"" get to make more money and you keep everyone happy. Please stop stroking the massive ego of the US market. Enough companies do that already. Like: Quantic Dream SA is a French video game developer based in Paris, France, founded on 3 June 1997. (The city that the game takes place in is never named, but signs on the highway in the chapter ""Crime Scene"" indicate that it is somewhere near New York. David Cage of Quantic Dream mentioned that the city is modelled after Philadelphia.)Again in Beyond: Two Souls's events occur in a contemporary American setting and centre on Jodie Holmes, a young woman who is psychically tethered to a ghostly entity named Aiden. Again in Detroit: Become Human. I don't have to talk about that. It happens in Detroit. Quantic Dream is a French company for Pete's sake yet it's catering to Us crowds.Another one. Ubisoft..... Ubisoft Entertainment SA (formerly Ubi Soft Entertainment Software), doing business as Ubisoft (formerly Ubi Soft), is a French multinational video game publisher, headquartered in Rennes, France So in essence another Frenc company. Doing what do you ask? Catering to Us crowds? I don't even have to mention to smart people how often this French company panders to the American market with it's Farcry series and Watchdog franchise.Don't get me started on other movies stroking the ego of the US. Military.It's about time people either stop stroking the massive throbbing ego of Americans and started stoking the international one. France has an outstanding military force. So does Germany. Norway is holding international Winter exercises with Nato Troops. Australians special forces are inhuman. Yet in Hollywoos these do not get represented in mainstream action flicks.Or abandon the whole Us vs. them mentality and did what Star Trek used to do, witch as uniting Humanity under one banner. Which was Starfleet, and it was a banner that every human and every alien on this planet could be proud of.9/10 If you enjoy brainless action, no emotion from start to finish. 10/10 if Hollywood would let the America throbbing swollen member go......let that go limp.

" ""Spectral""- A fast-paced high-concept Sci-Fi thriller. Not particularly original, but strong visual direction and heart-pounding action make it a fun watch.
",0.8722,0.9993,2017-05-03 00:00:00,7,"The history of ""Spectral"" is a strange story indeed. Originally a co- production between Universal and Legendary Pictures, the film is the brainchild of first time feature director Nic Mathieu and established writer George Nolfi, and stars a relatively talented cast of name actors including the likes of James Badge Dale, Bruce Greenwood, Emily Mortimer and even a small turn from the delightful Stephen Root. With a moderately sized budget, an entertaining high-concept story and top- notch talent on both sides of the camera, the film seemed like a surefire hit. They even got the effects geniuses of WETA to supply the many excellent digital effects. It was given a tentative Summer 2016 release and the stage seemed set.Then something happened. The film was given virtually no advertising. Hype was all but absent. And you could barely find a lick of information about it, despite a looming release window.While reports are sketchy, it seems Universal got cold feet regarding the project. Evidently, the executives in charge weren't pleased with the finished results, and decided to sever ties with the film, leaving it entirely in the hands of Legendary, who were out millions of dollars and now without a theatrical distributor at the last minute. Which is sadly something of a theme with some higher-concept projects Universal has been involved with at one time or another in the past. They seem all too game to begin work on these types of projects... only to either back out or otherwise screw over the production at the zero-hour. With seemingly no other options, Netflix eventually stepped up to the plate and the film was released in the Winter of 2016 as a ""Netflix Original.""Frankly... I don't know what Universal were thinking! While nothing revolutionary and suffering some clunky sequences and a few too many clichés, ""Spectral"" is actually quite a bit of fun, and is never anything less than completely entertaining. It's action-schlock through and though. But it seems to understand this and puts all its effort into giving us consistent and increasingly fierce thrills from start-to-finish.We follow DARPA scientist Dr. Mark Clyne (Dale), as he is whisked away to a war-zone in Eastern Europe and informed of a situation- some mysterious force is taking out American soldiers... a force that is apparently invisible to the human eye but visible through the use of hyperspectral imaging goggles that Clyne developed for the military. There to supervise, Clyne eventually finds himself drawn into an intense and violent conflict as it soon becomes all too obvious that the enemy aren't normal humans using adaptive camouflage as originally hypothesized... but that they just might be a dark force from beyond the realm of human understanding.The movie is a roller-coaster ride. With slick and stylish visual direction and a fun premise that mixes military dramas such as ""Black Hawk Down"" with supernatural Sci-Fi thrillers like ""Aliens"", it's a blast and a half from start to finish. First time director Mathieu is very confident in his abilities and demonstrates a keen understanding of flow and visual narrative. The budget is estimated to be in the $50-$70 million range, but Mathieu's wonderful sense of composition, movement and framing makes it look far grander. I've seen films with $200 million budgets that don't look this good. It's startling how much he is able to achieve with comparatively so little, and the film aesthetically rivals the best of the best in terms of big- budget Hollywood fare. And my lord, the action is just relentless and will leave your heart pounding. It's creative, fun and mixes good old- fashioned stunt-work with the latest innovations of computer technology in a very admirable way. I truly hope Mathieu is given another chance to direct a big-budget film for the big-screen. I'm very curious to see where he goes from here.I was also quite impressed with the cast. Our leads in James Badge Dale and Emily Mortimer are both quite good in their respective roles and are able to give a lot of weight to what are admittedly stock ""heroic"" characters. I also very much enjoyed Max Martini and Bruce Greenwood in supporting roles as members of the military. Especially Martini, who is ton of fun. (And also worked with lead James Badge Dale in Michael Bay's film ""13 Hours"") And even the smaller parts played by the likes of Stephen Root, Clayne Crawford and Cory Hardrict are very well cast. Just a good, solid ensemble that bring the film to life in the best of ways.Where the film doesn't fare so well is the writing. Not to say I had any particular problem with the script by George Nolfi... It's just a bit too reliant on the old clichés and has a few too many clunky sequences that don't always add up. Characters are particularly stock for the most part and the story hits all of the beats you'd expect it to, which robs much of the suspense. And without spoiling anything, the film makes a rather hard left turn towards the final act that might very well be too much for some to swallow.But honestly, when all is said and done... ""Spectral"" is here to entertain. And entertain it does! The action is fast and ferocious. Performances are quite good for the most part. And it's a competently made film with some fine visual storytelling. It won't win any awards, but as far as high-concept action goes... you could definitely do worse. I give it a solid 7 out of 10."

Spectral in contrast scored a big thumbs up for me for its solid and believable military spec ops content, interesting and original plot,the sound acting and especially for the locations which I believe were in Hungary, The urban and industrial sets were exceptionally well selected and prepared - very detailed. The action, and there was a lot of it, was very well done with some very good CGI work. Overall I found this a very entertaining, enjoyable and quality sci-fi movie which is all we really want in a night at the movies isn't it? Just wish there were more as good as this."
" If you don't know any delta guys this is good.
",0.4404,0.9914,2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"See , I hate it in movies when they make the special forces guys the typical jock macho guys.. ... they are not the gung ho kill everyone type of guys. I mean this movie just portrayed them like what we all imagine them to be , but the reality is that they just are not like that... . So I hated that. My brother is one of the least racist , sexist , macho type of guys ever. He is extremely humble and kind to everyone , so that disturbed me to a major degree and almost distracted me. In fact , every single SP forces guys I have met and known, has been a really wonderful guy.. a hero. In real life. Sure they can party like rock stars and be slightly hyper , but really great humble guys.. who would help an old lady across the street if she needed it. But I liked the concept and if I let go of the special forces stereo typing I could enjoy it.. but it was hard to do."
" Best sci fi film I have seen in a long time
",0.6369,0.9756,2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Just pure sci fiction at its finest, acting fantastic. This film made me believe what happened was possible, and that is indeed the essence of science fiction. To meld ones imagination with reality and to create a situation where its almost believable. This film managed to capture my interest. Finally we are getting back to some good old fashion take your time build up a plot and tell, actually communicate a story where it grips your interest creates excitement, thrills you in some aspects, and wow I wonder if that can actually be done thoughts, and I can totally see that happening..."
" Made, or at least edited for...TV
",0.0,-0.7853,2017-04-16 00:00:00,6,"I gave it 5 stars, my 12 y/o 6, and my 10 y/o 7. Both of them predicted every plot development, and all three of us agreed the plot was extremely preposterous, but not to the point it took away from the suspense. As a veteran, however, I found the military inaccuracies a little distracting. I have a hard time believing what a previous reviewer wrote about a $70M budget, however: The art direction and sound screamed made-for-TV. And the characters lacked depth even for a formulaic adventure flick. It was a little too intense and scary for anyone simple enough to enjoy the film very much (such as my 10 y/o), so I'm not sure for what target audience this was intended.But at least (MINOR PLOT SPOILER), as my boys said, ""at least there was no smooching!"""
" A well-made propaganda.
",-0.25,0.98,2017-04-10 00:00:00,4,"First of all, the movie suffers from a lot of clichés. Genius scientist? Yes. Placeholder female? Yes. Damsel in distress? Of course. Damsel capable of carrying 20-30kg weight armor+weapon? No problem. Damsel that shoots better than Delta Unit? Bingo! Throw in some predictable moments: speeches, crafting montage, showcase death scenes and spot-on problem resolution - and you'll see that directing\writing this movie was not exactly a breakthrough job.However, the practical idea of the movie - is not bad. It desperately(to the point of absurdity) tries to depict ghosts, and equally radically tries to explain them. Nonetheless, when you get to the finale, you can't help but nod at how semi-reasonable the trick is. I don't mean scientifically repeatable, it's Sci-Fiction for a reason. But still, there can be worse.The biggest issue, personally for me, however, is the propagandist nature of the movie. Of course, the world is used to heroic USA Delta Shmelta fighting Aliens, bugs, Predators and other fancy stuff. We also are used to them saving the world, giving speeches and generally not hiding their boner even one bit.But this... This story is built around a very recent, very relevant conflict... The Ukrainian Civil War. No, this is not tin-foil, not paranoia. Stuff began in 2014, movie is shot in 2016, there is a pretty good reason to say the words: ""Russia had it, lost it, and not can't let go""(or at least along these lines). Of course, USA are the peacekeepers there, digging their noses in foreign business. That's what national security is for, right? They position bases, supply soldiers and arms. Everything is so heroic! Such an innocent depiction of lies that actually make countries burn. But... it's Netflix, so what else would a proud American need? A fictional country with a fictional conflict that doesn't reflect the real world at all? Didn't want to miss their chance, I suppose.So, if this movie was not built upon propaganda - I'd easily give it 5 or 6 stars, because it's a good watch if you have nothing better to do. It's not outright cringing, it's got some tension. But... for me, the movie's agenda has ruined it. Maybe next time they'll shoot a movie about stopping some virus in Africa\Middle East, and to achieve that, they'll shove immigrants all over Europe. USA will be the heroes again, people will be saved, the sheep will be fed."
" Created an account to share how exquisitely garbage this move is
",0.4939,-0.884,2017-04-05 00:00:00,1,"As the title says, I've never felt the need to share a review of a movie/show as urgently as I do now. As a connoisseur of sci-fi and someone who appreciates military sci-fi in particular, I'd expected this to live up to the hype I'd heard... unfortunately it was hot garbage.If I had access to a time machine for only one trip, it would be to the moment I was going to begin this movie, tie myself up, and beat myself for the 108 minute run time and then thank myself for having not exposed myself to this spectacular failure of an idea and execution. As many have mentioned, there were decent aspects to the flick- after all, when involving a large group of professionals, someone ought to at least do a good job on accident. Nevertheless, the show was plagued by stupendously stupid writing by people who consider Ghost Hunters and Alex Jones to be exceedingly reputable venues of news and information. I can't express how painful it was to have watched over half of this torturous folly.I'd kill myself now but I feel that it's imperative to warn the rest of humanity until I die of natural causes or succeed in destroying in evidence of this movie's existence."
" Didn't really know what to expect and was reasonably satisfied

" Unexpectedly Good
",0.4404,0.9924,2017-03-24 00:00:00,8,"I downloaded this film to my phone to watch on my two hour bus rides that I take twice a day thinking it would be a fun but dumb popcorn flick, but I was pleasantly surprised. A B-grade TV cast gives this film it's all, and the producers and director utilize this by allowing the actors to really breathe life into the characters, which when combined with the fact that these actors are relatively unknown, adds up for a well acted character sci-fi drama really pulls you in if you let it do so. The battles are pretty by-the-numbers, but Legendary Pictures does what they do best: combining interesting ideas with good performances by unknown actors to deliver a solid picture that entertains and excites. After doing some research, I learned that this was originally going to be released by Universal Pictures, and while it probably wouldn't have done well in theatres, I would pay good money to see it in IMAX. Watch it with an open mind. Don't watch trailers for it, because if you go in with only a description, you will be enthralled at how surprisingly fun this small scale action flick can be."
" Great special effects and acting - poor script
",0.5719,0.9157,2017-03-14 00:00:00,3,"The production and special effects were fantastic. Acting was excellent, too. It's just that the script is lacking any sort of coherence or logic. This feels like a long TV episode of something like Stargate, where you're OK with people walking through walls but not falling through floors. It was entertaining on a purely visual level. And I kept watching to the end, hoping that it all pulled together. Spectral left me feeling like I put a puzzle together and, at the end, realized that there are pieces missing. Maybe those pieces are on the cutting room floor. But the movie fails to make any sense. If you're willing to suspend wondering ""How did they do that?"" ""How did they know that?"" ""Who did that?"" and just watch for the visual entertainment, go for it. It left me feeling disappointed."
" A Netflix release. A decent SF war story with some slick looking footage
",-0.5994,0.1886,2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"""Our business requires us to make suppositions. My business requires us to prove them. Your technician's job is to find glitches, so, he sees glitches. Your job is to find the enemy, so, you see the enemy. Locals believe in spirits, so they see spirits. Everyone is biased, in one way or another. So, my answer to you right now is that we lack data to support any theory.""I hope Netflix still has a few more similar films up their sleeve, because this was surely excellent work. Not only did it look great. It was also thrilling and action-packed. Unfortunately, the creators of this action-SF are huge admirers of ""Aliens"" I guess and based their concept a little bit too much on this blockbuster. Again, a group of hard-trained soldiers try to make their way through a war-ravaged metropolis while being harassed by non-human enemies whose touch is sufficient enough to make you fall stone dead on the spot. Even their sophisticated equipment is no match for these supernatural entities. The equivalent of Newt (the charming little girl with that tousled hair) is introduced as well. And of course, this group of soldiers serve one central person, Clyne (James Badge Dale), who has the key to the solution.The only thing that bothered me somewhat, was the denouement and the final explanation of the particular phenomena. I'm not doubting the intelligence of Dr. Clyne, but the sudden insights he gains here and the naturalness with which he brings forward solutions, is adjacent to the unbelievable. And how he could upgrade the weapons into ultimate defense weapons by using material that was lying around, made him look like a real MacGyver. The scene in the power plant of Masarov wouldn't be out of place in some kind of PS4 game. Only, the final scientific explanation was beyond my hat.Apparently, Universal Pictures has produced this film and pushed aside the film because they didn't believe in a successful worldwide release in cinemas (disappointing cost-benefit analysis, most likely). Maybe that explains the rather spectacular effects and overall design. Fortunately, Netflix has taken over this not so bad SF and started broadcasting this on their channels, otherwise this film would have died a quiet death. Ignore the coincidences (like the huge camera Clyne has taken with him, even though he didn't know what was going on) and some stupidities, and you'll surely get to see a sound and spectacular-looking SF. I thought the armor and weapons of the advancing troops really looked slick. Not those plastic fake firearms you give your adolescent children as a gift for Christmas. And when the final offensive is deployed, you can expect some decent action scenes.So! You have a Netflix subscription and you don't know what to do on a Sunday afternoon? Feel free to look for this film and enjoy a decent, cyberpunk war story. And if you have knowledge of the Slovenian language, you'll notice that the Moldovan little girl isn't speaking Moldavian. She speaks Slovene fluently (If I wasn't married to a Slovene girl, I wouldn't have noticed myself). It's these small imperfections that prevents this film to be among the greatest science-fictions. Mind you, the emphasis is on ""small"" when talking about these imperfections.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

I even enjoyed it considering it has some fine connections to actual science and have worked that into the movie.The visual effects are really nice and the acting is okay.HOWEVER, the extremely bad video/sound editing puts me off. Scenes which looks like an old Jackie Chan movie, where the character speaks and the mouth doesn't move in unison.

It's just a fantasy film masquerading as a sci-fi.2. NO and I repeat NO character development AT ALL. I know what you are thinking. You are assuming that I am being a little bit hyperbolic because at least the protagonist is going to have some development. NOPE! None whatsoever. Every character is virtually interchangeable with the other one. 3. Stupid plot. I mean, it's okay for a YouTuber to come up with a film plot like this. Expected better from this movie.4. The protagonist is supposed to be some kind of a top level science geek. Fine! But he's the same guy who will say one of the most jaw dropping stupid things about pain and science in the movie. Trying to write this without spoilers so can't tell you exactly what comment I'm referring to. However, just know that we are at a stage now where we can conduct scientific studies on pain felt by plants. 5. The physics explanations were beyond BS. As I've said earlier, they just made stuff up and expected the scientifically illiterate masses to believe ANYTHING.6. This type of a movie usually contains a few funny lines/situations. This movie contains none of that. If you still want to watch the movie, be prepared for the boredom."

This movie is so bad that I suppose it will get a cult following. I can fully imagine daring my friends to watch it. We will drink shots every time a shot is fired. 2 shots for every ridiculous gadget assembled in the middle of nowhere without any tools.I will give it that.

Putting all those movies in a blender doesn't create a fantastic movie but it is very much the sum of it's parts making this a not bad action flick.It's not a good movie, it feels a little disjointed and the more you think about the movie the less things will start to make science, combine that with the ending punchline being ""I guess there are some things Science can't explain"" and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth in many ways."

The first part of the movie was promising though because you don't really know what's happening. I had more problems with the second part, when we suddenly have a McGyver in our midst that can create weapons out of scratch. And this time not weapons with two screws and a rubber band but very sophisticated weapons that would take years if not a lifetime to create for specialized people. Here our local McGyver does it with scratch in a dusty bunker in a couple of hours. And not one weapon but an arsenal. That was way to stupid for me and it kind of ruined the movie for me. About the cast of Spectral you can just say they are not great and will never win any awards for their acting skills. All in all I thought it started good but with a weak ending. Too bad!"

US Forces, CIA and Private Weapons Research Contractor take it down. Very good classic Sci Fi. Technical without boring you. Reminds me of older 50's Sci -Fi where they take a scientific idea and run out to the extreme possibility. Many actors were well known faces and made the story that much more enjoyable since audience knows these folks are always in good flicks. Explanation of the technical side of plot is believable and not dull. Ending was well done and satisfying. Good and not trite or silly. Military jargon accurate. LIKE. Thumbs Up."

The locals believe that spirits of the war dead are rising. Fran Madison (Emily Mortimer) believes the spirits are actually camouflaged soldiers. General Orland (Bruce Greenwood) sends them in to investigate before trying to explain it to headquarters.This was pulled from cinematic release and purchased by Netflix. It looks like a properly funded production. It has a nice wartorn gritty setting and a good amount of hardware. It reveals too much too quickly. There are no shocking reveals or any tension from the unknown. It only has expositions. The movie shows the spectrals early on. There are stretches without much action. The setting is good with plenty of explosive action but it's not altogether that satisfying.

I was hyped for TDH but was bitterly disappointed by that movie so when i came across this on Netflix i almost gave it a miss but i'm glad i did not. Its the same sort of enemy, invisible and unaffected by conventional weapons so a way to stop them must be found blah blah blah....The action scenes were fun and exciting and it was enjoyable to find out what the enemy actually was and how they could be defeated. Acting was solid as was the camera work and special effects.Don't get me wrong some of the negative reviews are correct in saying its totally far-fetched in the way some of the tech is created to save the day but who cares?

Yeah the premise is a little out there and yeah they are just throwing some science terms around with very little explanation on how it applies but it gets at the core of a sci-fi thriller. It's a lot of fun. Guns, ghosts, combat, and honestly the acting wasn't terrible. Not a terrible story line either with a whole lot of suspense and pretty good cgi.

Some military big shots arrive who are impressed. They off course want to test this on something living so it can be turned into a weapon. The main developer Dr. Clyne isn't thrilled by the idea. He's more of a pacifist/defense guy than an aggressor.He's now called by the military to fly to Moldova. He invented the special goggles and military guys are seeing these ghostly figures. They show him footage of the sightings. A CIA girl is also there who suspects it's active camouflage used by the enemy. Local lore has it that what there are seeing are the ghosts of war.Clyne installs a camera on some armored truck and goes out on a mission to rescue a missing unit in a building. There they find lots of dead bodies and some guy hiding under a tub who survived. Upstairs more dead military until finally one of these shapes shows up and nearly wipes out everyone just by flying through them and is completely immune to all weapons.The few survivors make it to an abandoned plant where they notice that iron shavings keep the creatures out. Two local kids are also there. They hear more about the local lore. They manage to communicate with base and arrange for a landing zone nearby. That means facing these indestructible beings so they build some grenades with iron fillings. They meet up with the choppers and are flown to a civilian shelter because the beings have run over the base as well as towns all around.It's here that Clyne realizes what they are dealing with. The creatures are Bose-Einstein condensates that are powered from the main power station in Moldova. By retrofitting the available weapons they now have a way to fight these condensates. They launch an operation were the military guys will distract the condensates while Clyde and CIA girl go inside to find out what's going on and stop all of this once and for all.Inside they find scans of human bodies and 3D printers that are printing the condensates. Nearby are human nervous systems that are somehow kept ""alive"" which did belong to actual human beings. There are also plenty of condensates in capsules all over that are starting to escape. Meanwhile outside the ""dead"" condensates are coming to life again. So Clyne will have to figure out a way to put things to an end.Spectral is an outstanding sci-fi action movie. It's a bit too long and has too many acts. The first part as they arrive in the building to rescue the missing unit is very exiting. Things slow when they get to the abandoned plant. Then the movie tries to pick things up again for the power plant mission but by then you're somewhat exhausted. Unfortunately this was filmed mostly in gray color so the movies looks boring. During the major battle all you see is dusts of clouds with monochromatic humans and these lighter-shaded things zooming around. Acting is strong all around. The movie presents plenty of believable things and some stuff that doesn't pass muster. But that's fine. I'm giving this movie extra points for the fascinating science behind it all. I was unfamiliar with this and it is rare that a movie actually teachers the audience something new. I appreciated it a great deal. And it also was very well-handled. For once the filmmakers didn't mock science and scientists. Clyne looks like a regular guy, not your typical Hollywood scientist caricature. Also remarkable is that we don't get some unnecessary romance story here, which is what every other mediocre Hollywood script would have done.Spectral stands out not just among sci-fi action which is usually low-budget and underwhelming. This movie is a smart blockbuster."

A phenomena unlike anything humanity has ever seen before, but all figured out perfectly and in its full complexity, by one scientist bloke in the space of a few hours. Discussions on what to do next descending in to shouting matches before someone stamps their fist and utters something along the lines of ""listen to us, we're fighting amongst ourselves..."". A plot that is so incredibly implausible it would have been more believable if they'd just stuck with the ""they're ghosts"" explanation. The tough-guy grunts whose dialogue consists entirely of ""Go! Go! Go!"", impervious to injury. ...its one scene after another of pure cheese, and for that (and the decent SFX) it gets two stars. It was hard not to laugh the whole way through and almost felt like the film makers weren't taking it seriously themselves. In many ways the film more closely resembles a computer game, with similar cinematic sequences and cut scenes, but computer game manufacturers are doing a better job of dialogue and story these days."

Dale plays a scientist invested in designing protective tech for the US Army of the very-near future when he is assigned to accompany a Delta Force unit on the field in Moldova who have encountered, well, ghosts. Ghosts that can fly through walls and humans, the latter of which immediately perishes upon contact. Mathieu's constantly-moving camera-work and in-your-face visuals are slick and surprisingly high-quality, thanks to the use of Weta for the F/X work. The story, however, is nothing more than an outline for the big-bang shoot 'em-ups and creepy apparitions. The Delta Force team members are mostly faceless fodder smacking of, but lacking the charisma of, the marines from Aliens; they even rescue a blonde girl who has been scavenging and hiding out safe from the ghosts in the inner workings of an old factory. Later, when Delta has the chance to regroup and restock, they are luckily holed up with enough provisions and workable gear that would make B.A. Baracus smile with glee, welding torch in hand.The overall premise of Spectral makes for fun viewing. The film's a fast-paced video game where the viewer doesn't mind playing the third person role. And while the story briefly describes the HOW of the ghosts, the WHY is untouched resulting in an unfulfilled feeling as the convenient failsafe stopping the threat is thrown allowing the credits roll. The quick wrap-up makes you think that if there were a couple more available quarters to feed into the slot, the story could continue with a more satisfying ending."
" O my GOD
",0.4278,-0.8647,2017-01-04 00:00:00,2,"watching this movie was a horrible even painful experience for me and even the Bose-Einstein condensate could't save this film. After a strange beginning already struggling to understand what happening, why and when, the actors where spitting out strange meaningless words this highly advanced techno-abracadabra was build in Moldova by Moldovan scientists? why not in Pitkern island by alien penguins? It supposed to be Sci-Fi meaning believable use of current science not a complete mambo jumbo it felt like it was written by a monkey without even a basic understanding of anything. Though i can hardly believe any movie can surpass the horror and the headache inflicted by this movie on an unsuspecting viewer i gave it a well deserved 2."
" Rambo joins Delta Farce to shoot ghosts
",-0.6249,0.6758,2017-01-01 00:00:00,2,"I'm OK with a sci-fi premise, in-fact I like science fiction which is of course why I decided to watch this film. OK lets get to the two problems with this film. First if the real Delta force were as macho, poorly trained and undisciplined as this lot, I would be rooting for the bad guys every time. They started the movie questioning their orders, because you know that's what professional soldiers do and then showed us that lack of discipline for the remainder of the movie. They all looked like they needed less steroids and tight fitting shirts and more basic drill. Lets not start on the tactics they used. Yes they were actors and and as far as I could tell they all watched Rambo II for research and maybe a couple of video games. That would all be forgivable if the story was good. The concept is fine, the execution is clichéd and well just uninteresting. I didn't care what happened to the characters, because well, they were all a pain in the ass.It reminded me of the B grade 50's movies, just with less story and no one to like. I want a sequel, but only so the bad guys can win."
" Spectral isn't memorable
",0.0,0.9932,2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"Spectral is confused. Is it action? Is it thriller? Is it horror? The team behind this film apparently did not know. The entrance to this film tries to recall every B grade horror film, though with betterspecial effects.The rest of the film cannot quite decide what it is doing; the flailing of the plot writers almost, but not quite, crashes this film.The action and honestly fabulous special effects manage to save the whole thing. I am bad at pointing out positives, and honestly, these are two of the biggest. The action scenes are quite good, the special effects are beautiful. Onto the downsides; the acting hurts, the one liners hurt, the 'science' hurts and we get bashed a few times with the clichés of every action film either - the tough as nails American soldiers, the female spy, the action hero scientist who can do solve anything. Feeble attempts were made to give the characters personality, but they would have been better to abandon all hope of that. We're not here to emphasise with them. No one watches these type of films for that reason. Simple plot holes that could have been solved easily are disappointing. At one point, the cast ends up hiding out in a fortress that is apparently immune to the creatures. No one bothers to explain; someone seriously exclaims ""Oh, we're safe here for some reason."" Given the established lore by that point, it would've been easy to handwavium an excuse; the last time they ended up hiding out, the film spent several minutes building up to why they were safe. But these are not failings unique to this film, most action films get them, so in the end I enjoyed it enough to excuse the time spent. A lazy day film, not something to choose over the many better ones out there, but if you are like me and watch most blockbusters as soon as they come out, you'll find you need enjoyable but quickly forgotten films like this to fill in the spaces."
" Somewhere between ill-fitting khakis and a dumpster fire.
",-0.4588,0.0835,2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"So Netflix has kept a generally high level of quality through the years, but now it seems they've decided to tap into the Syfy networks market. Apparently, they want some of that sweet sweet Sharknado money and are not afraid to peddle out some real generic sci-fi garbage to get it! I don't know what Dean Cain was busy doing that made him pass on this he could have made this bland mess at least watchable on pure ""lolitude"" alone. I usually like Emily Mortimer too, so it's a shame they had to drag her down with this..If this is a precursor to what Netflix is going to produce from here on out, I'd just go ahead and unsubscribe from their services right now if I were you."
" Entertaining until the mysteries are revealed
",0.4404,-0.7787,2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"TLDR version: if you don't mind taking huge leaps to maintain a suspension of disbelief, then the movie is entertaining enough. If blatant technical impossibilities and logical failures in key story components bother you though, it might not be your best option.***SPOILER ALERT*** ***SPOILER ALERT*** ***SPOILER ALERT***One comment in the movie is that DARPA is many years away from coming close to developing active cloaking technology, which is the primary working theory to explain the ""hyper-spectral"" phenomena killing all the soldiers. This is shrugged aside as silly because duh, if DARPA can't do it, the bad guys surely can't. The alternative explanation preferred by the locals is ghosts. Apparently though, it's more reasonable (this is what is actually happening) that the bad guys have developed anthropomorphic avatars made of super low temperature Bose-Einstein condensate, which kills living things on contact, that can be controlled remotely by artificially sustained human central nervous systems extracted from civilians and imprisoned in a super-secret military research facility. But of course, they are bound by the laws of physics. They may be able to walk through walls, but pure iron stops them, and they can't pass through ceramics (like in the armor of the tanks they smash up). But they walk around in buildings and stuff, so normal floors and dirt ground support their weight...? At one point, the good guys barricade themselves in a building surrounded by a barrier of poured iron filings to protect themselves from incoming attacks. It seems that the 'ghosts' can't jump over the barrier, but later in the final battles, they can suddenly fly...? These, plus a solid handful of other liberal stretches of the imagination completely took me out of any involvement in the movie. The first half or so was enjoyable when it all still seemed 'real,' but I couldn't handle it after that."
" Entertaining!
",0.4926,0.9672,2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"I was pleasantly surprised watching this Sci-Fi thriller of a war movie. The scenery was engaging and spot on camera work was unobtrusive, some of the soldiers acting was not too believable but all in all the overall effect was a continuous ride of a story played out till the end. Bravo for that! The special effects were done well and blended in with the scenery. Some movies you can pause to hit the bathroom, this one didn't have many of those opportunities. At one point I was literally at the edge of my seat watching some action unfold. I would definitely recommend watching this movie, I am on the fence whether or not it belongs in my DVD/BlueRay collection."
