" Alfred Molina And John Lithgow Are Brilliant
",0.5859,0.7074,2020-03-01 00:00:00,10,"When I saw a movie that had both Alfred Molina and John Lithgow together and that was it, I was in. I was not disappointed, both actors shine in their roles. They are absolutely wonderful and the chemistry between them is what really sells the story. I also love the realism as well, these men are not wealthy with with unlimited funds, only one of them was working until he was fired from the Catholic school where he was teaching after they find out he married his long term partner. Ben (John Lithgow) and George (Alfred Molina) find they have to sell their apartment and because they have no real savings so they are forced to live separately for a while. This has a big impact on their lives and those around them. Molina and Lithgow are brilliant as the couple who no matter what is thrown in their path, still love each other completely. It is their performance that makes me give this film a ten star rating.
The rest of the cast are good, but overshadowed by the two leads.
Now as gentle and nuanced as this film is, it has it's problems. First, Ben's death. What happened? One minute he was there and then dead, they could have explained it better. The story between Joey and Vlad, there are so many dangling threads that are never tied up. It was just like the film ended, that was it. The film could have concentrated on George saying goodbye to Ben but instead focuses on Joey sobbing in a stairwell. Who was the girl at the end? Joey's girlfriend? The movie could have been a little more thought out but still, seeing Molina and Lithgow together was enough to forgive the film's faults.
I would recommend seeing this movie just for the performance of two great actors."
" Very moving
",0.0,0.9964,2019-04-27 00:00:00,8,"Ben (John Lithgow) and George (Alfred Molina) are a New York couple who get married after having lived together for nearly forty years. Shortly after the wedding, they are hit with a situation that causes them to temporarily live apart. Ben moves in with his nephew who has a young family; George moves in with a younger gay couple who are friends.""Love is Strange"" is a wonderful update to the brilliant "" Make Way for Tomorrow"" (1937), a rare movie that was made during the Depression and actually used the Depression as part of its storyline.Director Ira Sachs does a great job in conveying mood throughout this film. In Ben's new domestic setting, much tension is exposed with a powerful subtlety by the actors. Ben is having his own difficulties while his presence is exacerbating the usual problems that a young family faces with a pre-teenage son. Sachs also makes great use of classical piano pieces as part of the soundtrack creating a sweetness that is very touching.A couple of major plot points are predictable but the most important one is exposed uniquely as it takes place off-screen and the viewers learn of the event many days after it has taken place. This technique is quite effective.The film is filled with many sweet moments such as George conversing with a young gay man who shares about his fading relationship that is coming to an end. Other moments include the nostalgia for older ways of enjoying the arts and entertainment: George does not share the enthusiasm of a younger friend about modern technology and Netfilx while Ben shows great enthusiasm about seeing an old movie on a big screen in a theatre. The most beautiful moment of the movie is when the couple go out to a gay bar and converse about their lives, continuing their conversation as they walk in a deserted Greenwich Village street late at night. The sweetness and poignancy of this scene are lingering.Lithgow and Molina are superb in their performances easily convincing the audience that they truly are a couple who have been intimate for decades. Among the supporting performances, the best include Marisa Tomei and Charlie Tahan as the mother and son of the household where Ben resides."
" Drama Depends On Confrontation
",-0.3182,0.7574,2018-04-22 00:00:00,5,"I am marking this down because it could have been so much better. Its starting scenes promise a good story but disputes are resolved seemingly without confrontation, and drama depends on confrontation. The people in this movie are too timid to confront those who should be confronted whether it's the Catholic Church or a family member. Even the direction seemed to be trying to please everyone, from its choice of score to the photography. Unnecessary scenes didn't set the mood but just added to the slowness and boredom. Maybe it got better but I couldn't finish it."
" Homeless In New York
",0.0,-0.0129,2018-01-22 00:00:00,9,"On rewatching writer-director Ira Sachs' touching, perfectly-formed, 2014 low-key drama, it struck me that one of the most thought-provoking things about the film is the multi-dimensional potential of its title. Not only does Sachs' choice to portray the deep affection felt between two ageing homosexuals set his drama apart (even now) from the mainstream of Hollywood films, but a relationship longevity of 39 years is an equally rare thing it seems these days. Most pivotally for Sachs' narrative, though, is the fact that the choice made by Alfred Molina's Catholic school music teacher, George, and John Lithgow's artist, Ben, to seal the marital knot on their obviously loving relationship provokes the powers that be to sack George from his job, thereby forcing the couple to sell their New York apartment and to take up offers of (hopefully temporary) accommodation with family and neighbours, in the process necessitating the pair's physical separation. What follows is a perfectly judged, naturalistic drama, full of moments of poignancy and wry humour, perceptively co-written by Sachs and Mauricio Zacharias, and touching on themes of family dysfunction, intergenerational difference, guilt and regret, in which we really feel for George and Ben as seemingly helpless victims of unfair circumstance. Sachs' observational touch is particularly adept around the intergenerational angle, for which, amongst an all-round superlative cast, Marisa Tomei's niece to Ben, Kate, and her son, Charlie Tahan's Joey are outstanding. The film's subtle, poetic qualities are also enhanced by the choice of some sublime Chopin piano music, whilst Christos Voudouris' cinematography, though generally unfussy, also gives us some memorable sunsets of the New York skyline. The film's narrative arc and its take on the bittersweet nature of fate and fortune also culminates in one of the most strikingly uplifting closing sequences that I can recall anywhere, providing us with a final dimension and take on Sachs' film title."

",0.0,-0.7964,2017-06-27 00:00:00,7,"Alfred Molina and his partner give bravura performances, but enough with the gay thing already.We see joy at the wedding of the couple, only to see one lose his job as a music teacher at a Catholic school for obvious reasons afterwards.As stated, the acting is excellent and Marisa Tomei steals every scene she is in as the aunt-by-marriage to one of the gay partners in the film.The story also points out the apartment crisis in the city once the couple loses their apartment and is forced to live separately while desperately searching for new digs. That part of the film reminded me of the great Make Way for Tomorrow, circa 1937 with Victor Moore and Beulah Bondi. Housing affects all people regardless of sexual orientation."
