Love everyone irrespective of how and what they are as each may be going through their own roller coaster ride.
This movie makes you smile/cry at certain situations.
All in all very movie which you can watch with family"
" What does make sense?
",0.0,-0.9689,2020-09-09 00:00:00,1,"It's in the Top Rated Indian Movies 31. What a joke. it's an insult for the other top-rated movies on the list. One of the worst movies I have ever watched in my life. It even does not deserve 1 star, how 8?Guys, these ratings come from the unit and fake accounts who gave it as 10/10. Btw, it deserves (minus) 8.The story of a girl, she and her partner, a transgender, faces some social problems and they are now seeking revenge using a television program 'behind the scene' set. Police, special forces are trying to manage the situation from the outside.Worst acting, and most boring gameplay, 1 by 1... As if the whole world of logic is a joke.What a time waste. Why I am wasting time reviewing here? To aware you, keep away from this garbage. Don't believe the ratings more than 1, you will regret, and come to know, I was right."

During the show, nothing happens as expected. The two were not what they were pretending to be.The dialogues are witty. Dark side of the story is revealed slowly and you are drawn into it.It will not be wrong to say I have never enjoyed any film as much as I enjoyed watching Aruvi. Everything was going well but just before the second half, in an uninteresting turn of events, she shot a man. From there it all went downhill. A super interesting film turns into usual affair.Very few films take mental issues seriously. The way Aruvi's story is told, we can't help but start questioning everyone.It's a black comedy, but I won't put it into a specific genre. It's a film like only it is. It's not your usual drama. The film doesn't use any stereotype. It's worth your time."

But the logic less and unrealistic depiction of the events discredited the message it was supposed to spread.For the lack of credibility and content the final verdict about the film is:NOT RECOMMENDED."

'Aruvi' movie is a glimpse into what stages her life is going through.Aruvi {(adithi balan) was born into a middle class family consisting of her father, mother and brother she who wants to live independently like all women. At one point, she and her family realize that she has AIDS. Family members are forced to believe that she got AIDS because she was in a physical relationship with someone had AIDS
With that, their live's harmony and dreams disappears. After she leaves her home, she is unable to cope with family neglect .later, her life and perspective shifts to a different levelBut no women can forgive a man who has sexualy abuse, there is no need and no man can speak casually in front of a woman he has raped
But these two things happen herea women who puts you in a room he holding a gun threaten you to do what she wants Occasionally she look you and smile repeatedly.
What's on your mind?
""is it her mad?""
I felt like this too.
But the characters enjoy with her.
The director has said that she is mentally ill. It could have been a little more goodThis movie, it was like to be a director's opposition to the outlook of society
We think we live in harmony with society But the truth is, we are living in fear of society. Every day we are constantly telling others that we are good,i am perfect."

Director : @arunprabu_p
DOP : #shelleycalist
Cast : @officialaditibalanOne of the best tearjerker and heartfelt film which Closer to your heart !The film is so effortlessly crowd-pleasing - and also tremendously moving. This is, by far, the most unconventional among the recent new-age films, with a bravura lead performance by Aditi Balan. It is certainly one of the most sparkling acting debuts Tamil cinema has seen in a while, and Aditi beautifully realises the complex nature of the character without trying hard to make her Aruvi endearing. Even in the final portions, when there are tragic tones, the actress doesn't resort to melodrama and performs this role in a matter-of-fact manner.The actress is ably guided by the direction of Arun Prabu Purushothaman, who joins the list of first-rate debutant directors we have got this year. If his writing displays a sensitivity that you don't often see in a first-time filmmaker, there is flair in his filmmaking that gives this film a distinct new-age vibe.Mainly it triggered a bullet on the So called media programmes, which makes cash with your problems by telecasting !It is a sure slipper shot to that kind of so called media like #TV9 #Mahanews #ABN #Rachabanda #Bathukujatkabandi and many ! Have to shoot them at the spot !!"
" Offers hope in a turbulent world
",0.4404,0.9819,2019-11-19 00:00:00,9,"The entire film was like good poetry to me. It made me cry. It made me smile. It made me fume, cringe and choke with emotion - and all these, I rarely do when I see a film. Maybe as a woman, I could relate to so much it said not just blatantly but also between the lines. But more importantly, I felt it was a movie on not just feminism. That would be an understatement. It was superb commentary on many things preventing us from reaching a world where people can be happy regardless of wealth, status, power, or gender. The film celebrates individuality and contrary of what many say, I don't think it is preachy. The strongest message to me was that, individuals are not black or white, and amidst all the crime and negativity, there's still hope to connect to the fundamental benevolence in people."
" An eclectic experience ! A MUST WATCH !!

Sounds too close to real life.. does it ?Aruvi is a genre grinder which mixes all this and more into a narrative that is engaging and enthralling in equal measure.Debutante Aditi Balan, who plays the titular protagonist, is a natural and shines bright in a layered role. Her superlative performance which sees her shouldering the entire movie and make it stick together is among the best this year and is sure to bring her many laurels.
Director Arun Prabhu Purushothaman has announced himself as a helmer to look forward to with this audacious debut feature. He brilliantly strings together diverse strands of his storyline to concoct a captivating symphony like a seasoned maestro. Check out the initial sequences of measured vignettes from Aruvi's unfolding childhood which subtly state a lot and surreptitiously smuggle us into the storyline and create an instant connect with her and make us care for her. Or the way, he can transition from a tense situation of a terror response into a playful mood of truth or dare that takes us on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Arun Prabhu Purushothaman is a welcome addition to the league of promising debutantes directors in Tamil cinema this year which included Sri Ganesh (8 Thottaakkal), Karthick Naren (Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru), Lokesh Kanagaraj (Maanagaram), Nithilan Swaminathan (Kurangu Bommai) and Gopi Nayinar (Aramm)."

The director and cinematography has created a pretty character , aruvi's childhood days were well portrayed on screen and the way transformation happens in her life. I enjoyed every single moment in this movie especially the bottle rolling scenes and story of the granny which was compared to a sandwich dosa and many such heart touching scenes are there in the movie.

Is it to raise awareness about HIV, is it against consumerism, is it about reckless college goers, is it a revenge drama, or is about parental bond? It ultimately ends up as a confusing mish mash of all.Aditi Balan is superlative as Aruvi. Special mention for Anjali Varadhan, who plays Emily, a transwoman with lot of grace and dignity."

Whole ""spin the bottle"" scene is unbelievable. Many unrequired comic elements are added in an otherwise serious drama. Writing is very good. It actually gives meaning to many little things, which you don't think are important in the beginning. It doesn't leave any string untied at the end. Direction is okay.

",0.6542,0.8916,2018-02-25 00:00:00,6,"The middle part of the movie that deals with the reality TV show is a well-made spoof and critique of shows of such genre. But, the whole story is rather contrived; and the ending too sentimental.
I wonder why the director chose a taboo subject and tried to glorify that character beyond normal circumstances. It is also obvious that the story intends to portray the lead female actor as a liberal girl fed up with social expectations for conformity. But, such a girl still has to contract AIDS under 'mysterious' circumstances! Probably, the makers were so much concerned to take care of her so called 'character'! May be, from their point of view the character might have lost its 'purity' if AIDS was contracted through the most common means!

",0.5423,0.9587,2018-02-19 00:00:00,7,"I don't dislike this movie and at the same time I dont think it is a path breaking experience and questions society as I have seen in some reviews.Though it is high on emotions,the ratings,and the beginning 20 mins are highly misleading.Heck even the storyline present in imdb is misleading.The protagonist as said in that storyline does not take hard on people instead she is amicable and playful which is a huge let down for me because I was misled by its ratings and initial 20 minutes.I wanted her to be rebellious and question the perception of majority.The movie doesn't put forward a moral and critical question but instead gives a lament message which it does very well indeed.I don't know why people think otherwise and say that their perception is changed.If this movie came 10-15 years before I may have agreed with that statement.Because if you had a contradicting perception before I don't know how do you fit in 21st century.Is this movie a new attempt and is never tried before?Yes but isn't as courageous as I have expected.Now coming to the positives the emotional thread of protagonist is well executed and the actress who did it is amazing.I don't want to spoil too much but the life of lead character is shown very well with little diversions here and there.There are some flaws in other characters but it is acceptable if you overlook it.These are my opinions about the movie.Avoid falling for its high ratings and reviews and enjoy the emotional drama and exceptional performance of the lead character."

" Fruitful taste of trustiness
",0.3818,0.9976,2018-02-06 00:00:00,8,"ARUVI
Arun Prabhu Purushothaman
 It's been a time that something haunts me for the past couple of days again after the re-watching of the movie Aruvi. I just recall a resonance from the cracking voice of Aruvi at the end portion. I think she has some sort of trouble rather than the reason of her unhealthy condition but more about the disturbances that she is undergone from her early days. She doesn't want to culminate everything. She wants to teach. She wants to tell something without any mode of violence that's why she creates a new path of revenge. Yes, that was her revenge, a subtle more of her anger and abnormality through which she likes to deal with not only the three of them but also the entire community who are witnessing her. Aruvi is not just a single girl, she is the representation of each and every one and what she tells are the voices of many. 
 I have been thinking about the title of the movie since the initial watching. For me, the first watch was just a vague experience because I stick only to the plot outside. I watched like a 'simple' audience, who goes along with the film and literally threw the film after it gets over. Nothing matters to them afterwards. They valued it as mere a matter of entertainment, so that what is inside the film doesn't matters to them. I was like that initially because as I early said I was just gone only through the outside plot of the movie. But after the second watch I realize what the film meant to be. This might be a stick on problem, what actually the film was. Actually the movie ends at the interval portion because the role of editor to edge the audience from the opening ends at the interval portion. After that he doesn't carry much effort. We were talked about the title and I just skipped from that. Aruvi, it is the name of the central character a cute, innocent, naughty girl, teenager and a woman. Aruvi the same meaning in English is River. Girls are like river somehow, I don't know; but here Aruvi is like a river. She is flowing. Her life flows in a way which she doesn't like. Firstly through that chronic disease, then her abandonment from the family, the sour taste from the people who gave her a life pack and at-last her unhealthy condition that gave by her life itself. She is little bit (not a little) a struggling women. But she covers everything deliberately with some smiles at various intervals even though at the climax of the movie. There were rocks, trees and many obstacles in the flowing path of river but it must have to flow, like-wise Aruvi's life also have these kinds of obstacles but she flows smoothly. What Aruvi meant to be is; it was our way of life and the rules for the life. Nothing matters. We can make our life better. Smile at everyone who make harm to you, like Aruvi.
 So we were talked about movie from its periphery now I want to get deeper into it. I'm very much fascinated about the acting of Aditi Balan, undoubtedly who done the role of Aruvi. She just handled each phase of her life smoothly that wonders me because she done it with an ease like an experienced actor. Everything in the movie is fresh. From the director, he himself is a new comer into the film field. So simply we can call this movie as a legendry work from the upcoming legends. Yes, I call each and every one who work in the film is legends because they are seem to be like that. Why I am pointing more and more uprisings about the movie? The answer is simple; it touched me a lot, not only Aruvi but also the entire crew. As an aspiring filmmaker this one gives me an inspiration to jump into some extra-ordinary themes and plots which I already got from Karthick Naren's Dhruvangal Pathinaru. 
 Apart from the over-view of the theme and the subject, we should overlook to the technical side of the film as well. First, we can discuss about another creativity level of the film that is its music. I think, the first thing I'm bound with the movie is its editing and we pointed a short about it above. After editing what attracted me about the movie is its music. The phase of the music and background score changes unto the maximum when the movie got to subject its steady flow. Initially she was little Aruvi and that cuteness is drawn nicely through that initial song. That song also reveals her affection towards her family especially with her father. When the film jumps on from one layer to another the mood of the song gets deviated and sometimes it becomes rocked at some part. The modern derivation of the classical devotional notes are highly marked which revokes me to the poster of the movie (Goddess Saraswathi holing a gun). So it is a matter of appreciation to Vedandh Bharadwaj and Bindhu Malini for such a splendid music.
 Arun Prabhu Purushothaman, the debut filmmaker arranged the movie in an unaccountable way. He seems to be a professional and look like an experienced filmmaker. It was his sheer courage along with the teamwork to put forward the movie. He took a challenge to go along with fresher's not only technical side but also for the acting purpose. He trusted them as well. They trusted him too. So that Aruvi was a fruitful taste of trustiness."
" Aruvi-The girl who wanted to live!!
",0.0,0.982,2018-01-29 00:00:00,9,"Awe-inspiring reviews from a majority of the viewers made me to watch the movie with high hopes.But,initially the movie was a bit confused.At times,felt it like a coming of age movie of a girl from a village who had to shift to a bigger city due to her dad's job.The scenes leading to interrogation was too mysterious to begin with.There were some incomplete statements in between.Most of those statements were flashbacks.I thought that I missed something and had to rewind the video.Then,a question came.What is so special about this movie which made it a sensation last year?
 These were my impressions of the movie 'Aruvi' at start.But when the 'Green Room' was transformed to 'Interval' in the movie,I was absolutely stunned by what I just saw on the screen.An amazing work by Arun prabhu Purushothaman,which made viewers confused,mysterious and thrilled at times until interval was about a cause which needed attention from the society all the time.A theme,which was always narrated as a near to documentary type ,brimful with over sentiments got unveiled in a contemporary way. Aruvi(Aditi Balan) ,born and lived as a normal girl who was loved by her parents and brother got into trouble at a certain period of her life.It wasn't her fault,but there was none to believe her.Then she left her family and started a way of living in her on way and terms,later to be caught up into some situations.Then she reacted to all the misfortunes and hatred she had to bear in her life in a unique way.Sorry,the story can't be too elaborated than this.'Coz,'Aruvi' is a movie which demands actual movie experience.If one is unaware of the story,this is an absolute piece of breathtaking experience.this movie will tickle your sense of thrill,mystery ,downcast and even make you laugh at times.
Last Word: Aditi Balan enacted her role so brilliantly that one wouldn't surprise if she gets some Elite Awards for the role.The movie really deserves more appreciation form the nation,as it concerns everyone.Buckle up to watch one of the best movies of our time,if you haven't watched it yet."

" Sub-standard in most aspects
",0.0,-0.9438,2018-01-27 00:00:00,1,"Tamil cinema continues to veer as far away from reality as possible. This film is no different. It is still better than Telugu films, which cannot think beyond marriage or pelli. However, in this also, the actress laments about her marriage in the end. The film from the very start was rushed. The characters are all half baked and cliched. This seems to be norm now-a-days, there is no attempt to develop the character. Or it was a deliberate decision, considering the only real reason for making this movie was to rant against men. Watching the film I was wondering that does Tamil viewers really buy this stuff? Tamil films' relation with quick highs and cheap thrills is well know. This film is no different. It shows an IPS officer, ex-Commando, no less, interrogating the actress asking if she is from any terrorist organisation. This, after it is clear that the motive of hostage situation was make the rapists apologize on live TV. No IPS officer, let alone an ex-Commando is that stupid. That cannot be said about the makers of this film though. There is a scene where the heroine keeps a group of hapless men on their toes in front of her, asking them to do her bidding at gun point. If you flip the scene and had hero done that with a group of women, it would suddenly become unacceptable. The film is misandric, openly being hateful of men, of fellow human beings. The makers had some narrow agenda, and it would appear that they set forth with all their might to getting that agenda on the screen. If only they hadn't made it so poorly. The film appears contrived in almost every frame. It was a wastage of time. Performances of two actors stand out. One is Lakshmi Gopalaswamy, who did a good job, and another is an actor, who recites the multiplication table of 7 under duress. Who knew, under the labyrinth of this sordid movie you will find moments of good acting?"

Aruvi, she is not a good girl and she doesn't claims that the society or family or the men surrounding her put into that insanity. She knew she is not good rather she needs to prove her justification. She wants to show something. That's why she turn out of terror. Something comic derivation can also seen at the stuck portion of the subject simultaneously it overcome with the climax which we saw what might be the final stage of Aruvi, the character. I think it is a deviation or the change of path to depict any kind of women oriented subject into the silver screen."

" Pain and Agony - Well captured
",-0.6124,-0.6444,2018-01-01 00:00:00,9,"We chose to watch this movie given that it was considered to be different. The start was confusing, with the Police, commotion, rain, enquiry, hindi speaking top cop et al during the first few minutes. 
The background of a waterfall, a young girl, a caring father who stops smoking when the child says it ""stinks"", a loving brother who sneaks in a surprise gift for the sister and the mother is how the story starts weaving itself in the flashback. The whole world turns upside down when Aruvi is diagnosed with AIDS. Disgust in the family, the father starts smoking again, brother distances himself, the mother cries in agony.
The movie trolls the reality show titled ""Solvadellam Unmai"" in its own way. What strikes is the nature of such reality shows that tend to exploit the subtle and deeply personal problems of individuals and families, all for TRP ratings. Though this has been depicted in a comical way featuring Actress Urvashi earlier, this movie takes the troll to a new level.
The movie also depicts the vultures and hyenas who feast on those who are weak and vulnerable by way of the three characters. Friend's father (a widower), A pseudo religious guru and the manager from a garment factory (which is known for all kind of harassment related exploits). The Assistant Director tries to make hay with the story of Aruvi and Director hatches a plan to exploit Aruvi herself. The anchor Lakshmi Gopalakrishnan has done her role well. All credit to Arun Kumar Purushothaman for the characterization and selection of actors. Aditi Balan has played it with all her might and deserves a special mention.
The entire floor turns around when Aruvi discloses that she is AIDS positive and the three exploiters hear this in awe. The anchor for the show wriggles in discomfort. Director of the show wants to increase the tension by not disclosing the results Elisa test. Aruvi shooting him gets justified. 
As Aruvi plays the Roulette the softer side of the Garment factory Manager surfaces. Pattinathar's song in the background when he describes the death of an old lady who used to feed the hungry is good choice. The role play by the Security Guard, TV Show Anchor and the Garment Factory manager turns hilarious and again mocks the reality show ""Solvadellam Unmai"".
The office boy Subhash capitalizes on the situation and adds a bottle of beer to the order ! 
When the whole story unfolds and everyone comes to terms with the erratic behavior of an AIDS affected individual coming to terms with reality, the top cop hands over a greeting card with a subtle message of ""Don't Quit"". 
The whole crew along with the family going over to visit Aruvi when she sends a video message depicts the acceptance of Aruvi as she is and coming to terms with the unfortunate turn of events in her life.
In essence the movie tries to convey a message that all AIDS infections are not sexually transmitted. It also portrays the mental agony of the individual who gets ignored, subsequently abused by the society.
With all this said, we encountered someone in the lift who muttered, ""We should have chosen Velaikkaran"""

" Good attempt at total social commentary, but ultimately flawed..
",0.2382,-0.9637,2017-12-29 00:00:00,5,"(This is the longest review I have ever written! Why I wrote this long because I needed to pour out my whole brain in to a thing which was all against what I am hearing from people. I might be going harsh on this film but it is to express my flaws in the movie.
I have no idea if you would read all this, but hey if you are up for it, let go on this ride.)
Guess I'm the black ship. Because I think the movie is okay, not much more than that. I think it had great potential to be more. This large hype and this hysteria, I really don't know, maybe because people always got/saw 'mass' films and over the top films, not the down to earth one. If you loved and enjoyed this film, good for you!The beginning montage shots through Aruvi's life was brilliant. The director deserves due respect for those moments, just beautiful. The way he concealed how her family ostracize her, how she got aids, the family misunderstanding was very good.But for me in the 2nd act while the director, Arun prabhu was getting on with his commentary of reality shows (the comedy moments) ,when the three guys were called up, she reveals she has aids and all hell breaks loose, the movie faltered for me.
The timing of her coming to the show is off. Because temple guy, friend's dad all violated her when she was still in home (with her parents) or after she left her home. Then she arranged the 1 lakh for her father, where the 3rd person (guy who hired her for tailoring) comes into play. But after that she goes on a vacation with her friend and all.
All these must have taken at least some months before the tv show events right?
Then all of a sudden, she wanted to bring this into fore. Maybe she was mulling on this on her vacation and wanted some justice or some reveal to happen. I don't know.Main question.
What was her motive to come to the show - For them to apologize. She tells that beforehand. I guess she must have called them or confronted before for the apology.
She might not have got what she wanted, so she took it to the next level - TV show.
So, what was her plan (after the aids reveal) if they don't apologize. Get the gun from her bag and force them? Kind of stupid!
So seriously what was her motive??? Reveal to them in a shocking fashion that they could have contradicted aids? To shame them on TV? Expose them? That seems like a more probable reason. What if they don't act as they have done any wrong? I really don't know.
So all three must have had raped her or some form of sexual acts on her judging by their reactions on hearing the reveal.
The guy who employed her asked for some sexual favour for money. But knowing she has aids she shouldn't have indulged in that, but that guy is bad for asking for sex but still I don't know if she should transfer the disease knowingly.
Friend's dad guy and temple dude did bad things to her when she was not conscious, so they are very much in the guilty side. They raped her! But it's okay she don't want to file a case or anything, she just wants them to apologize to her. Not very good scenario if all girls just want apologies if something horrible happens to them. But I guess she didn't want anything more from them, because she was feeling guilty that they might have contracted aids and she didn't tell them after what they have done to her.Also the bashing scene of her (for not revealing being an aids patient) by the host was so stupid, because if they (the 3 bad guys) did anything bad to her, it was while she was NOT conscious except that guy who hired her. Any 'fault' on her part might be that she didn't inform them but they were monsters, I don't think they deserve that info considering she didn't report to the authorities, maybe that was best punishment for them. So everybody ignoring that aspect is just plain stupidity. Aruvi kind of mentions about it in a blitz but it wasn't stressed enough in the movie.Major plot point - Shooting the director of TV show
The 'All hope lost aids' card can't be played like that while she shot the director. She could have just shot up the ceiling if she wanted everyone to quieten down. Also she could have really lost control and shot the director but then the scene was not convincingly set up, she didn't look angry or anything to commit the act.
And this scene is very important because it changes the whole dynamics of the film.
When she shot that director, you can't argue she was trained in shooting. Though she saw the gun from her childhood, it's not like she has shot or practised shooting. So basically, she could have killed the director which is very much important, you just can't take life of a person just because you are sick of the person or irritated or angry or whatever. She just met that guy!
You can't claim that this was all a plan because she herelf confirms everything got out of hand.The fact that she carries her gun in bag is very unsettling, plus the bullets!
 What is she preparing for. So was she staging a big commotion on a big regional TV, if so it would be for nothing.The ragging scene. Blah. I was like all the people in the TV show room must be knowing at this point that she is just messing around and stuff. Felt more like put in for comedy relief and to reflect the hypocrisy in reality shows about everything being staged and not real. She could have just walked off at the start itself and surrender to the police.
But she just wanted to be a college senior for a while, mess around and later feed them. Kind of like an exposition scene to show how loving,caring, funny she is?Police catches her.
I understand they be kept in medical camps but that doesn't mean that all aids people can cause crime and not be punished. What happened in between, did I miss anything?
Doesn't the case still exist? Well it was a national news and a hostage crisis case's culprit (also an attempted murder, also shooting the director itself could be brought in focus her mental instability
) can't be released just like that. Even if all the people involved were to be like she was very loving towards us or we were treated nicely etc, we don't have any complains, can a case of such public attention and high profile be left like that and not punished. 
No security details around them???? How did she, how can she escape with such deteriorated, fragile health and supposedly police surveillance around her? How did she acquire money to living alone somewhere remote, consuming her ART medications and cooking stuff, internet connection?
I don't know the legal side to all this so there's that.The last scenes were projected as the sad scenes, didn't really feel real to me. While she was explaining about how she missed everyone and how she was scared, the director could have atleast removed the background sad music to make it more real and though wind sounds were put in it doesn't at all feel like something taken in a smartphone, her voice was so crisp and clear (ADR done in a studio), it removed the originality. Also the above things bothered me and took me out of the scene completely. (Also how did they track her down, it's not like she told anyone her address and if it was possible to track her, I can't imagine how much media people would be trying to get to her because she presents a great story. And like I said above is the case still on, doesn't the police want her for court trial?)Finally this is all seems like a rant (having myself read this essay) but I don't want this to be so. Just a thought process by an average joe. Maybe there is answers to all questions that I have posed here, but from what the movie showed me, I wasn't satisfied.
For me the film is a flawed attempt with a good short film at the beginning."
" Overrated and awful!
",-0.5093,-0.9876,2017-12-28 00:00:00,1,"The film is overly dramatic, gross at times, and awful! The movie sends a message that living with HIV is equivalent to death sentence. HIV is a manageable chronic disease and it is not the end of the world.The director does not have his facts straight about HIV. HIV does not progress to AIDS (which is now called stage 3 instead of AIDS) for 5-10 years after the person is first infected. So, how come the lead character experiences weight loss and AIDS related symptoms in such a short span of time?Also modern day HIV medications do not cause hair loss as a side effect and hair loss is generally not a symptom of HIV. The weight loss accompanied with it would have made sense 15 years ago when HIV medications were not technically advanced. It is highly misleading to portray HIV as a ""death sentence"" while the reality is far from it. This movie will scare any sexually active person into thinking that HIV could kill them."

" A lifetime Experience
",0.0,0.9337,2017-12-26 00:00:00,10,"ARUVI A lifetime experience. A stirring poetry of comfort and conflict . Movie carefully but consistently travels between the montage and narrative movie patterns complimented by a strong non-linear screenplay. Movie heads to a climax of profound human connectedness but with a profound agony.A Must watch.Aruvi will leave a deep impact on its viewers. It may leave an impression, or nostalgia or a scar based on what kinda of a person you are. But this movie is not going to go way without making a mark in everyone's mind. Gift from a new kid in the block(Arun), to remind the world, TAMIL cinema is much ahead of ""so called"" progressive cinema in the spectrum of international film fraternity."
" Life isn't black and white
",0.0,0.8766,2017-12-25 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie that everyone must and should watch, I would say one of the best in the year 2017, and my comparison is not only with other Tamil movies.
The director has literally shaken the stereotype of movies where plot lines are black and white, good beats evil, etc. The director has very skilfully, and at the same time very artfully portrayed a snapshot of life, with all the associated greys in between. It's hard to say if this movie is a comedy or a tragedy or a celebration, but then again, isn't life just the same?Special mention to the cast, especially the lead actress Aditi Balan. Very rarely do we come across such talent in a debutant actress. I would say she has lived the role rather than simply performing it during the movie. Her subtle moves and gestures throughout the film have not gaudy element nor a bit of overacting. It is every bit as real as watching a real life event unfold in front of our eyes.Don't miss this movie. The director has managed to convey a very important social message in an elegant and simple manner. I won't say what it is, lest it spoil the suspense of the movie for you."
" Best Tamil film of 2017
",0.6369,0.7761,2017-12-24 00:00:00,10,"This might be the greatest movie Kollywood has offered us this year. With riveting screenplay and an excellent performance from newcomer Aditi Balan, Aruvi will keep you at the edge of your seats with nail biting sequences and an emotional backstory. Pretty much every element in this movie works cohesively with the script, and I'm hard-pressed to even find a flaw that is worth mentioning.Finally Tamil heroines are no longer props used for dance sequences but are the center point of a film that deals with real-life problems.. I don't want to spoil it for people haven't seen it yet, but this is a must watch for anybody who watches Tamil cinema."
" The Best
",0.6369,0.8219,2017-12-24 00:00:00,10,"The best movie i ever seen in my life
Aruvi is a superbly written drama centred around a unique character that unfolds as a thriller, a black comedy, an awareness movie, and a tragedy. The film is so effortlessly crowd-pleasing - and also tremendously moving. This is, by far, the most unconventional among the recent new-age films, with a bravura lead performance by Aditi Balan. It is certainly one of the most sparkling acting debuts Tamil cinema has seen in a while, and Aditi beautifully realises the complex nature of the character without trying hard to make her Aruvi endearing. Even in the final portions, when there are tragic tones, the actress doesn't resort to melodrama and performs this role in a matter-of-fact manner. The actress is ably guided by the direction of Arun Prabu Purushothaman, who joins the list of first-rate debutant directors we have got this year. If his writing displays a sensitivity that you don't often see in a first-time filmmaker, there is flair in his filmmaking that gives this film a distinct new-age vibe."
" A Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.0,2017-12-23 00:00:00,10,Its very rare to see a movie which takes you through so much variety of emotions... A refreshing experience indeed.. Pure cinematic bliss.. Aditi Balan is scintillating..
" Waterfall of human mixed-emotions
",0.0,0.9967,2017-12-22 00:00:00,10,"Aruvi is a waterfall of human mixed-emotions pouring flawlessly out of screen.. It looks so beautiful outside when this characters makes you amuse and laugh effortlessly, and the next frame, it hits you deep as hard the water hits the rock at the bottom.. The sight of very passionate filmmaker(newcomer Arun Prabu) who not only titled his movie(Aruvi) perfectly but also narrated it flawlessly..
The casting almost entirely new faces, looks like just graduated from a film academy but very well played their role.. While the lovely-rebellious Aditi Balan(Aruvi) given a lifetime performance which lingers wild in your mind, her supporting cast the transgender character was a shoutout-heart winning performance!
The story-to think, this terrific idea of this storyline, filmmaking concept coming out from Arun Prabu ingenious mind, is an amazing thing.. something that only director Bala could do at this mainstream tamil cinema level.. This guy has done it masterfully with all the right elements of a exemplary cinematic experience, loved his thoughtful non-cliche ending.!
Just another best part of the movie is the music score, the work of newcomers Bindhumalini&Vedanth was fabulous, striking the right chords all the way!
Aruvi is an silent scream from Tamil cinema to the world that they could produce such rare gems at times! To the director Arun Prabu, take a bow Sir, your fascinating-masterpiece is the best film of the year! #Aruvi"
" One of the best movies in Indian cine Industry

Must watch movie, it might not be a big block buster but definitely award winning movie and will turn the tables for all the debute. Credit goes to the entire team. Wish there were more cinemas like these in Indian industry."
" Aruvi - A Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9803,2017-12-21 00:00:00,9,"Aruvi will be one of the iconic movie of Tamil industry. Arun and his team delivered a masterpiece which will be a cult classical movie forever. Aditi balan did a mind blowing performance.Movie will make you laugh, cry, will give you pain, surprise you in many places and at the same time slap you hard in many places. What is society teaching us? Where is our future is going on? A script which is written in 2013 is still making an impact means the director really had a futuristic thinking. As an individual we always point at others mistake, but never thought are we 100% perfect? We don't have any rights to point out others mistake until we are perfect.First 30 minutes of the movie i was not sure where this is headed and there is 1 scene where i felt the plot is completely getting revealed and why the first 30 minutes was like that. There is one scene where the whole characters in movie will get shocked, it will shock everyone in theater as well. Pros:
-Ofcourse there are only more and more pros for the movie, as already everyone knows the script,acting,directing and music are the biggest backbone of the movie.
Some 10 years before there is a movie which took a topic which is mentioned in this movie as well, Director took that topic again and slapped the societies behaviour. A big change is required in our country towards women, hope this movie will bring some changeIt is always difficult to make an award winning movie with some entertaining stuffs in it. To our surprise the movie plot is going in such a way that we will not get bored any where.A big success of the movie will be ""Even if you are out of the theater and thinking about the movie and it is creating a big impact towards you"", This is one such gem which will be in your thoughts and make you think before you do something wrong to this society."

Such a hard hitting and gutsy Tamil movie after a long period.Realistic and well matured performance from Aditi Balan deserves National Award , she is fun loving, bold and honest.She will make us to smile ,love ,think, trust, survive and more tears.It shows how people currently living/acting in this society to earn/survive in this big bad world and will teach us how to trust/treat people.Feminism should get more respect and protection from this society.While walking out of theater one could feel the burden of emotions from heart and speechless.Credit to Arun Prabhu to make us to flow in this Aruvi .Undoubtedly the best movie in tamil era."

A story that made me glued to my seat without nail biting action or thrilling scene, a tremendous performance and body language from a new face actress that made me felt im living in her shoes, a fantastic storyline that you can hardly tell its from a debutant director, dark comedies that can make you laugh and provoke your thoughts during serious scenes. Music and BGM was just too good, it soothes when it need to sooth, it hurts when you made to cry for the performance. Even when alaipaayuthey introduced maddy as new face, I was not able to accept the chocolate boy then, yaareda ivan nu appo feel pannuchi. But inthe movie leh almost every faces are new but everyone made me feel as if all are seasoned actor and actresses. 
Big kudos to director @Arun Prabu Purushothaman and team and much love for Aditi Balan for the spectacular performance.

" Aruvi is the voice of everyone, a movie to think through
",0.0,0.9899,2017-12-18 00:00:00,9,"Aruvi is a movie of its kind convincingly breaking the stereotypes and the commercial factor of the Tamil cinema, possibly the strongest contender for the movie of the year. Aditi Balan is arguably amazing and setting new standards for being a protagonist in a movie. The efforts made by her for this movie is surreal and honestly only few would dare to take such a role and being a debutant with such a subtle performance clearly shows her passion and love for acting and cinema.Director's vision about the society and the changes that many are craving to bring about can be clearly seen on the screen. This is a message that ought to be said to one and all, well there is no other bigger platform than cinema. Arun was so clear in his direction for what should be an entertainer while creating an everlasting impact for the people. Along with the director, every artist deserves the credit.Aruvi will be well remembered for the changes and upbringings it will create in our society."
" powerful stream that bashes up left and right

Be it the studio assistant, cameraman, security guard - literally everyone was given their own importance and were portrayed extremely well.With the backing of such a heavy script, Shelley Calist (cinematographer) focused more on intensity of the performance, to so-called cinemascopic shots.Bindhu Malini and Vedanth Bharadwaj (Music), had to play like Gautam when Viru is bashing up all over the park - The perfect partnership.Aruvi - powerful stream that bashes up left and right. Be ready with your answers.. Ready for the test?"
" If it doesn't arouse, is it art? ARUVI does
",0.0,0.1133,2017-12-16 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the best films of 2017 with an almost watertight screenplay that keeps you completely engrossed from start to finish with some mesmerizing central performances from the characters and the sidekicks but the main attraction of this movie has to be Aditi Balan. This actress manages to pull you in the story. She brings an intensity to the screen that only a few actors and actresses are able to do. You will love her and care for her. Through her you will experience a morality play showing how evil does not necessarily manifest itself in an orgy of destruction caused by war, that its roots may lie concealed in the malicious pranks of everyday life. I had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch this, and I was pleasantly surprised by a film that confounded all of my expectations.Aditi Balan, the lead actress at the center of ARUVI has lived the character and her ability to portray both utter intelligence and unknowable vacancy, as she does here, shows an uncommon deal of range. Her character in ARUVI has dropped out of society and every hint that we get is greeted with a contradiction. It then unfolds, flashbacks sandwiched between the main story. This way the movie never lets go of the suspense, while on the same time, it unravels new things for the viewer.Well there are abundant world movies on psycho-cultural mirrors, harassment, male domination and abuse that are far better than this and Black Book, Red Road, Red, White & Blue comes to mind. I can't deny the fact that the Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu's ending with 'Katheyondu Shuruvaagide' song runs through towards the climax of the Aruvi.Do not go to this movie expecting right to win and evil to perish, it won't happen, but along the way you will be asked to question every assumption. But believe me it's not easy being a woman in India and on the other hand this not a feminist movie as few of my friends had stated so. This is uncompromising, unashamed and a smash in your face, Post-Modernism, philosophical drama in short and on the side note the war between the rat race sexes and hedonist will rage on regardless."
