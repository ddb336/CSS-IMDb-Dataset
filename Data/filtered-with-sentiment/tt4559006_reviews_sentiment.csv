" probably the ONLY bollywood movie I can relate to
",0.0,0.9053,2020-12-06 00:00:00,9,"THIS MOVIE isn't for everyone, and even the story isn't relatable to my life for the most of the part BUT it got that thing that I can see if the misunderstanding didn't become clear to me at the right time then it could've went too far and we would NEVER be this much close friends now.
So, yeah! 9/10 is accurate rating from me, I'd give it a 10 if the story wasn't rushed in the first half, I'd love to see a web-series on a story like this ""platonic love""."
" Overacting. Irrelevance.
",0.0,-0.8014,2020-11-13 00:00:00,2,"This movie has nothing new to offer. Ranbir Kapoor, as usual, plays a heartbroken puppy and borderline pysho. Anushka is very loud and annoying. She's obsessed with a DJ but there's no backstory.One hour into the movie and absolutely nothing happens except some useless banter between the two leads and the movie looks like it's not going anywhere. Some of the scenes actually look like there was no script but the actors were just asked to talk and act whatever and however they want to.Shahrukh Khan is exceptional in a cameo. Aishwarya is looking very beautiful and graceful, she is a not so successful poet but lives in a huge mansion in Vienna.Overall, it's a waste of time. There are no laughs, no emotional scenes.PS: When someone has cancer, there's a lot more than a smooth bald head that happens."

",0.8972,0.9974,2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,"Let me tell you why this movie is touching your heart:Love is more than you know!I was saddened to see all the negative publicity this movie garnered prior to its release but all that's done and dusted now and the world gets to see another Karan Johar love story. From the outset, I had huge expectations from this movie and I am glad, the movie did not disappoint me. First, the STARS of the movie have done an amazing job portraying their characters. Aishwarya is stunning, Ranbir is outstanding and Anushka is terrific. Second, the story line is different and powerful. The message that Love is not just about being in a physical relationship has been delivered in a meaningful way. Third, the music exceeds expectations from a Karan Johar movie (Channa Mereya touched my soul). Fourth, the movie is lively, real, colorful (perfect release for Diwali) and very well directed. This is my favorite Karan johar movie till date. I hardy write reviews but after seeing what some of the users have posted so far, I felt obliged to share my views. Go watch it guys and happy diwali to you all! Cheers!"

",0.3612,0.991,2020-09-17 00:00:00,4,"This movie had so many superstars - Fawad Khan, Imran Abbas Naqvi, Shahrukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai, Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Lara Dutta... but seems like except Anushka and Ranbir, rest were used as side actors/special appearances.. I am surprised that heartthrobs like Fawad and Imran Abbas Naqvi even accepted these roles. Hardly enough of acting display..The movie kicks off with excessive overacting by Lara Dutta, Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma followed by Shahrukh Khan. Aishwarya acts ok and Ranbir and Anushka get better later in the movie. Story is big disappointment. Way too many stars raise audience expectations, but end up in dismay. The movie is based on romance but there's not much display of romance between Anushka and Fawad. And romance between Anushka and Ranbir is not impactful. Especially if you compare to some good work making romantic films by Karan Johar in the past - Kal ho na ho, Kabhi khushi Kabhi Gamm, Kuch kuch hota hai, this was a big disappointment.Only saving grace is songs and partially good acting by Anushka and Ranbir."

",-0.4939,0.476,2020-07-05 00:00:00,4,"Forget the script, the chemistry between Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai is extremely hot, one of the hottest I have ever seen in Bollywood history. They could have set the screen on fire, if only justice was done to their roles. I mean to say is that Karan Johar kind of only teased love making scenes between the two, I won't call it proper love making scenes at all, just wasted. There is not even a kissing scene between the two. Karan Johar could have gone more intimate with these two, which would have done proper justice to their scorching chemistry.The 4 stars are just for Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai's chemistry, which didn't fulfill the potential though."

",0.6369,0.9001,2020-06-23 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
setting and mood of the movie; the movie sets a good periphery to narrate an interesting love story. The cast, supporting casts, editing, background scores, cinematography were done good. The screenplay remained consistent relatively and guided the narrative of the movie in the opening and middle staging.What did not work:
screenplay; the movie was an engaging ride for the three forth of the movie. Though inconsistent at times, it was worth watching. Movie failed miserably on the final half, the setting went off track, filled with cliche movements which made the experience awful and intolerable. Of course, it was fun to take the ride but the conclusion and ending made the ride unsatisfactory and dull overall.Final verdict:

Also, the characters are one tone throughout the movie and by the end, you don't care about them in any wayThe final nail on the coffin is Anushka's cancer, like seriously, its the most cliche plot point of Bollywood and has been used more than anything else, expected something better than this in 2016.The movie was just badly written and could have been made a lot better if the story was a bit more thought out.Watch it only for some good emotional scenes, awesome music, and Ranbir Kapoor's performance but despite all of these, its really tough to like this film."

I was watching it in phone and within 20-30 minutes I started swipe forwarding this bore fest. Dialogues are like shayari which hardly you understand. Only good thing is srk cameo but his face looked like CGI as if he just came out of fan shooting. I wonder how it became a success. It surpasses johar's previous worst film kabhi alvida naa kehna.

" Ultimately Unsatisfying
",0.0,0.994,2018-09-28 00:00:00,6,"After a chance meeting, Aryan (Ranbir Kapoor) and Alizeh (Anushka Sharma) become best friends. After a while, Aryan falls in love with Alizeh, but she remains in love with her ex-boyfriend. After an emotional split between the two friends, Aryan meets sophisticated poet Saba (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan). They begin a relationship, but Aryan has not gotten over Alizeh. This story of unrequited love has a generally well-written, mostly credible plot. It has the feel, though, of a Western film, much more than a Bollywood movie. It is not a family film, as it contains adult situations. Kapoor acted well, and Sharma was charming and natural; Bachchan was a little stiff at times. The music was okay, though I don't have an opinion about the lyrics as the version I watched didn't have subtitles for the songs. This could have been a excellent emtional drama, but unfortunately the last chapter (so to speak) was neither moving nor convincing and made the overall movie ultimately unsatisfying.Cast also includes Fawad Khan, Lisa Hayden, and cameos by Shah Rukh Khan and Alia Bhatt."

The second thing would be that this is not your traditional Bollywood movie. I would place this movie in the same category as Yeh jawaani hai deewani and Tamasha."
" A love story beyond it's time
",0.6369,0.9904,2017-09-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a movie that will appeal to every human that lives by his emotions. It's a story that needed to be told. The relationship between Ayaan and Alizeh is something that has never been explored before in Indian cinema and befits the new generation. The friendship between Alizeh and Ayaan (and not the other way round) is one of the most beautifully depicted and unknown dimension of emotion.The movie is full of meaningful dialogues and subtle emotions. The character of Ayaan consistently failing to understand Alizeh's perspective on their relationship and ever trying to make her fall in ""love"" is so appealing that even the viewer will start sympathizing with him. But ultimately the movie talks about beauty of other kinds of emotions and not just ""love"". But at the same time it also portrays what it is like to be foolishly in love and losing, like Anushka and Fawad, Aishwarya and Shahrukh. Aishwarya is like a fresh breeze in the movie. The poetry and songs are meaningful and soothing. The movie has a perfect balance of humor and emotions.Acting has been stellar by all, especially Anushka. Ranbir dazzles you in so many scenes, like the Channa Mereya song and the scene following it. The way Anushka instantly recognizes the pain in Ranbir's voice when he sings and realizes he has actually had his heart broken now. Some scenes are very powerful, like the scene when Anushka visits Ranbir and Aishwarya and is still not jealous of him but happy despite Ranbir's best efforts. Or like the scene towards the end when Anushka is dying with cancer and has little time with only Ranbir by her side and he tries to kiss her and she still refuses. He knows she has little time and still wants to earn her love.Watch this movie from your heart and not your mind and you may experience what it is actually about."

It's not only about the plot or story in a romantic movie, music, script, words everything contributes to an emotional romantic movie and this one has a perfect mix. Despite having so much, it was criticized maybe because that's how romantic themes are, everyone cannot agree on many things about it, and some don't believe in its reality. Unrequited love can be very hard to express and I must say Ranbir does a good job, with every cry of his, your heart will cry out too. Aishwarya nails her dialogues in the movie and shows a different side, Anushka shares a great chemistry with Ranbir! Watch it for friendship and Love!"

" Ridiculously Bad !!
",-0.7568,0.9856,2017-07-29 00:00:00,4,"Its always difficult to write a movie review for an excellent film or a very bad film. There is too much content to put on paper and one has keeping on filtering.ADHM is the latter. Frankly, this is the worst film Johar has made according to me. A lot of the people have criticised Kabhi Alvida.... stating it was a bad film. I however consider it to be Johar's best film till date. ADHM is so bad that the barely watchable SOTY deserves a reconsideration.ADHM could have been a beautiful story of a man's craziness for the woman he loves but who doesn't love him in return. Its a story which most of us would connect with easily. But Johar and his writing spoils this film. I could never understand through the film why Ranbir's character is so madly in love with Anushka's character. I agree he is a loner and needs love but Anushka's Aliyzeh does nothing special.The movie is bizarre for most parts and tested my patience multiple times. There were scenes where I wanted to give one tight slap to Ranbir's Ayan because he just doesn't want to grow up and accept reality.Towards the end of the film, my mother and me couldn't stop laughing because the film had lost its direction and Ranbir's pain had become comical.The only good things of this film are the soulful music by Pritam, awesome lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya, songs sung soulfully by Arijit Singh and last of all Aishwarya Rai.Rai rocks once she appears in the film in the 2nd half. She demands the audience attention and she is only reason with the music that I gave this film 4/10. Her dialogue delivery is magical and at 43 she looks gorgeous. She shares a nice chemistry with Ranbir.Coming to Ranbir. He is a brilliant actor but the writing and direction pull him down. And I don't want to see him play this man child again. He has done it in Wake up Sid, in Rockstar and again here. He needs better scripts. Also, I was curious to know Ayan's back story. He is a rich kid who moves in a private jet. But who is his Dad and why he became like this. I wish there was a scene with his Dad somewhere in the film.Anushka is good but again loses out on poor characterization. Why does she hang around Ayan? Why she leaves her Fawad Khan? Nothing is explained.And there is SRK is small cameo who as usual hams it. Why on earth do u ham it? Technically its a brilliantly written and directed scene but SRK doesn't do justice. I wish some like Devgn was performing the scene.Finally, a bad film. Watch it on our own peril and my word to Karan. Please do films like SOTY. You are better off and so are we."

Looked more like the starting of Koffee with karan where Karan responds to odd ques thrown at him and he reciprocates with his witty one liners but as soon as we hear Ranbir talking about "" ek tarfa pyar ki taqat"" you realize this movie is going to be a bad screenplay with nothing new to offer. Personally I don't think that Karan Johar is a bad director, I think can make good films because no matter how bad the content is he still manages to convince the viewers which many try and fail. His universe is rich but superficial. His hero is a good actor but the character was very weak. Ranbir looked good when he played two guys in the same movie. One was confident when talking to Aishwarya Rai and other had a strange tone and abruptness when talking to Anushka. You could see the change over if you observe closely. Apart from this nothing good happened. Shahrukh appeared in one scene and even he was not taking this film seriously and he was at his best (over acting). Aishwarya was clueless but carried her clueless character with confidence. Anushka plays Anushka like no one could. Actually she has mastered her character of a bubbly chirpy girl. Story was cliché and contrived. Maybe the edit suffered because FAwad was totally removed. The songs were the only part where i used to have some fun except the breakup song. It was so bad and I actually laughed when i saw Alia as the Dj. THe family looked like a family vacation where everyone said - let us shoot! and they made a story while actually shooting this film. The film tried to touch a good issue of a guy in love but it never came out. Good thing - Ranbir Kapoor, songs. Bad thing - the rest of it."

The actors, moments, all that. Many have reviewed it and its true what they say, but everything in this movie comes together so naturally, its like the rhythm of the past has taken a more relevant newer form but the emotions are the same. Experience a little of devdas, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, any many others. just watch without inhibitions and have fun."
" what a shame!
",-0.5255,-0.9789,2017-04-09 00:00:00,4,"The stars go only to Aishwarya's part, the only mature, though pointless, part of the movie, Ranbir's great and Anushka's beautiful performances.I liked Karan Johar's previous works, especially KANK, but this was a disaster. It's like he had yet to decide what he wanted to say but just couldn't wait to make the movie; and this confused stoyless drama happened. I wish he had worked more on the story, not because he's a brilliant director, he's not, but because he's good at making us cry. This didn't even make me cry and I'm always ready to cry. The cancer part with those stupid wigs was just.. Annoying! Looking at Anushka and Ranbir in those wigs just made me cringe of how fake it looked on them and how nobody tried to make it more real and we're supposed to buy it all?Yes, this is his worst work, and if you don't want to waste your time on the whole movie, which is a smart choice, at least give Aish a chance to mesmerize you."
" This movie sucks!
",-0.4199,-0.9923,2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"I watch a lot of Bollywood movies but have never felt compelled to write a movie review before. However this movie was so bad that I knew that I have to warn others. I was attracted to the song ""Bulleya"" of ADHM and being a RK's fan, decided to watch the movie on iTunes. What a disaster it turned out to be! Why was this movie shot in Europe with the background of private jets and what nots ? Why not in India with the background of Indian culture? Karan Johar has weird ideas about western culture which he superimposes on the Indian culture wherever and whenever he wants and produces a fusion which does not make any sense at all. Perhaps KJ should first live in the west and experience the culture first hand before casually applying it to his Indian characters. KJ obviously does not have any clue that Indians (and even most Americans) living in the west usually do NOT have the ""Sex and the city "" lifestyle and that only very few western millionaires have private jets! Regarding the story, the movie does NOT have any. It is a stupid, silly movie. It is not even a romantic movie. Ranbir Kapoor (RK) is wasting himself by acting in such idiotic pictures. Anushka Sharma is totally unbearable and nauseating. She needs acting lessons. Aishwarya Rai and Fawad Khan were decent. Anushka's cancer scenes were unrealistic. What happened to her extended family? What was she doing alone in the UK with this illness? The movie has NO link to reason or logic. It moves from India to one location in Europe to another and yet another with no logistical constraints of reality begging the question again that why native India was not chosen as the background to the story line? What was KJ's purpose of hopping around the globe in private jets and/or even showcasing SRK's exhibition in European city? Which world is KJ living in? It certainly is not Planet earth!! I need to watch a really good movie next to get this one out of my system. I don't recall watching such a bad movie in a very long time."
" This movie is about getting friend-zoned and STAYING THERE. What a bad and disastrous try to copy of The Fault in our Stars
",-0.8779,0.988,2017-02-17 00:00:00,2,"The first half of the film has nothing happening. The director is rich & so are the characters. So they roam around lip-synching famous Hindi film songs and dialogues, somewhere foreshadowing the arriving of SRK. You meet at a party and start kissing - that's Hollywood. You meet someone in a different country and start speaking Hindi at your very first conversation - that's BS. The first half is all about these two idiots running around different places. The second half takes pace but then again, from the story POV, there is nothing new. Nothing. It's a shame that some celebrities are praising the film (maybe to be in the good books of the director). Yes, some of the songs are good & the lyrics are beautiful too. But nothing else is. What is the use of going to New York or any other place and staying in a room to write your next screenplay when it turns out to be so distasteful? Anushka and Ranbir are good in their parts. Ash is wasted & made to show how beautiful she still is rather than how good she can act. It's a shame that the lead actors who can act brilliantly have to act in such films with bad plot lines. Yes again Karan Johar does not disappoint at making crappy movies!He outperformed himself yet again with same old wannabe shabby movie. He has no sense of movie making yet people watch his shyt (this is the last time I have wasted my money & time)!It's high time public reject such useless directors whose only name for fame is that they are well connected and son's of some film personality. Tired of watching Ranbir and Anushka doing same type of roles. These wannabe Hollywood type Boollywood dumbos are the worst.If you have nothing to do in life and decide to watch this movie! Take some headache removal pills with you! After student of the year and many such crop movies this is yet another headache from johar! Acting was mind blowing.. Anushka nailed it in 1st half with her acting... But No Story.. directionless..2nd Half.. Aish came in.. Pleasure to watch.. Shahrukh's Cameo Alia's CameoLocations are Nice.. Good acting by Ranbir.. But still no Story.. No direction.. When will this end.. everyone shouting.. angry.. One word -> TortureIf you have seen Kal ho na ho.. then its the same.. Anushka playing SRK and Ranbir as Preity ZintaSongs are nice but they are too many.. bad things.Its not a love story it is a getting friend-zoned movie. Sad to say Bollywood has forgotten to male good love stories. Like the songs go download them from YouTube don't waste your time on this. Giving 2/10 for songs"
" Just Plain Boring
",-0.3182,0.9874,2017-02-13 00:00:00,3,"I ask myself, why did I have to go and buy this DVD ???Saw Ae Dil Hai Mushkil after Dear Zindagi expecting at least some entertainment value after the boring DZ. God, was I disappointed. ADHM was only marginally better because of the music. The plus points: Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma acted very well. The music was very good. The costumers especially Anushka's outfits were nice and trendsetting. I love the flowing kurti with slim fit jeans style.The minus points: The story line was just plain boring. Like Dear Zindagi, this went on and on and on with no end in sight. The unrequited love theme has been done to death. I expected something far better from Karan Johan, what on earth were you thinking with this script? It could have been salvaged with tighter editing and cutting short by at least an hour. Okay, it was somewhat better than Dear Zindagi .....So much hoo haa about Fawad Khan who had just a bit role as the handsome DJ husband. Ranbir and Anushka were wasted in this film.Please Karan, please come out with better films in the future. What a waste of acting talent."
" Karan Johar wants to tell it right.........
",0.0,0.9951,2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"This is a another Karan Johar romance drama movie. Karan Johar wanted to take this story as it is reality. To do that he makes the movie a little bit longer that's the biggest flaw of this movie. If you want to tell a sad romance story you have end it with a sad feel that's make the movie better but in this movie he wanted to make the ending happy and it felt longer boring.after watching it, this movie literally feels like its a combination of three separate movies. The premise was nice plot is nice i understand that it have tell it that way.There are some good things in this movie. The acting is Good.The songs and musics are great. The dialogues of some scenes are very heavy and touchy. A very little cameo from SRK is really good.At the start there is a comic relief humors then it goes into sadness through the whole movie which would be better if it is not long with every scenes. While watching this you feel like they may should just skipped it.All Over this movie is too long too watch at least feels that way. Some People gonna love it i understand why they love it because the story has had a touch of reality. All over its a average boring romantic drama..... 6/10...."
" Love Story Of Rich
",0.8316,0.9991,2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Watched it today on Amazon prime. I wanted to view this movie only to see Aishwarya Rai all beautiful and lovely. It was like those kind of movies which I just see for time pass and laugh off at the bad writing dialogues or just to see a pretty lady(Kind of it was in the Sunny Leone movie league for me). The dialogues were very very cringe, shots just too fast like a typical Bollywood movie but all lead to a good climax so 8. It is actually a great story only if it clicks you chances of which are less cause you need to be rich to get those feelings/emotions (Even i am not rich but somehow I felt rich may be behaving as such). As many have pointed out it is very shallow, True and it is the exact representation of the rich youth the dialogue is plain disgusting which I later realized is how the rich people talk. I mean you see Lisa Haydon behaving like a spoiled rich kid so she is in the extreme ""Amer bap k bigot allot"" type, the leads are"" Amer bap ke but not bogged"", they are superficial still cause they feel that moment was love. Make pretty bad jokes, do not have depth, avoid confrontation. I liked the pressure cooker bit in the climax, because it was not the typical masque love story it was a very urban take. Shah Rukh Khan was WOW in those moments he appeared, mostly he behaved as Shahrukh Khan yet even being himself is too good to look, cause he is so complex yet deep and very very convincing only i do not like his choice of films, he never risks it all so Aamir is still the best. See the there were no drag bits or yawn moments but some scenes in first half seemed fillers. Aishwarya is pretty much as much in film as you see in the trailer just one extra scene, and that scene was gold too. Itbwas so subtle and it appeared out of nowhere. But that ranbir-Aish love story was not very clear as what is happening was it just a time pass affair. Actually it was shown as a thing Ranbir did to make Anushka feel jealous but then that part was not explored maybe it was meant to be the way it was I mean just like han it is the second support and he was notbat all involved or in love with her and therefore he ran back. Well i did notbquite figure out that part may be it needs a second viewing to get that part.Overall it is not for all movie, and I am surprises as to how it earned 100 Cr cause only the rich and the intellectuals might get it I compare it aside Zoya akhta's Dil Dhadakne Do, the rich issues s are being discussed, so coming back to how it earned 100 Cr, I guess I should open an discussion because it is difficult for people to connect with it and yet film did business"

",0.0,0.9496,2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"I love films and I watch films from all around the world - French, Japanese, Korean, Iranian, Spanish, British, American etc. When you go and watch a film please watch with an open mind, don't relate it to your life. Karan Johar has a certain style which does come across his films. I haven't seen all of his films apart from Kuch Kuch Hota hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Ghem which were both well made films though if I had to rate those films I would rate 7-8/10. All others films I was bit disappointed but this film collaboration of Indian and Pakistani actors, story, acting, humour were up to the mark. I have read some reviews people comparing and saying ""He is Hollywood Wannabe"" 90 percent of Indian films are a copy of some Hollywood film, many of them are literally same setting, same scenes, same acting only badly done. I wouldn't say this film was entirely original but least it wasn't entirely a copy. It was funny, glamorous, heart breaking. Overall a very strong film. I was going to rate it 9 but people being unfair rating it 1-2. I am going to rate this film a 10."
" Most Awful movie i have ever watched
",-0.5095,-0.1757,2017-01-20 00:00:00,1,"This is the most Awful movie i have ever seen. It was free for me on TataSky Showcase and I thought i will spend some time. But within 10 minutes i felt like vomiting. Worst movie i have ever tried to watch. Please do not waste your time on this ""Wahiyaat"" movie. No morals, no ethics. I wonder is the world really become this cheap watching this movie. No story. Only beautiful faces. Few decent songs. Thats all. Dialogues are just picked up from various old Hindi movies. If Karan johar did not knew how to fill the movie with when there was no script he took the crew to different European locations and made the actors dance to old Hindi movie songs. Please avoid this movie. If you want to watch it watch it at your own risk. Bollywood can't stoop more lower than this."
" What a let down
",0.0,0.9183,2017-01-15 00:00:00,3,"This movie is basically the same as any other karan Johan movie, kal ho na ho, Kuch kuch hota hai, etc. All of these movies basically have the same story line. It always has to be a love triangle. Just because the movie has sharukh khan, aishwarya and ranbir in it doesn't mean the movie has to be good. When I turned this movie on thinking it was gonna be great and all, halfway through the movie and yet there was no story they were just going places acting like idiots. It was nothing new and exciting. My husband didn't even know who directed/produced this movie but 30mins into the movie he said ""I bet karan Johar made this movie"" and it was true. movie had good actors but story was such a clichè"
" A mishmash of KHNH and other such mush..
",0.0,0.9433,2017-01-12 00:00:00,2,"Of late, it's the women who are carrying the Bollywood movies on their slender but strong shoulders. Dipika Padukone has been doing it for awhile, others are not far behind either. The watchability of 'ae dil hai mushkil' too is totally dependent Anushka Sharma. The initial comedy and the old hit songs also helped but certainly not Karan Johar's self-proclaimed attempt at being intellectual! :( Also, what is it with the old songs? Undoubtedly, Bollywood has enough hit music to fill a whole year's worth of new movies - if one wanted to. But that's not what movie making is about, right? In any case, ADHM appears simply to be a mishmash of 'kal ho na ho' and other mush from KJo stables despite 'appearances'.Psst.. what was all that hoopla about Fawad Khan??"
" This film will give u cancer - literally
",-0.6597,0.8981,2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"if you have not watched this film, then my sincere request is don't watch it. do not even read reviews. change channels when you see the movie playing. Have you ever seen bad films? have you ever seen films which you have no idea about? (do not bring Kubrick or Nolan in it). ADHM is so bad that it will give you cancer in your eyes. rich people, rich places, rich clothes but doing things that even nursery kids will n to do. Everyone is falling in love with everyone in the movie and yet there is no love story. basically what Rockstar did in 15 minutes with 2 songs, ADHM took 2 hours to explain. sincere advice to Karan Johar- stoop making weird films. and stop asking actors to do cameos in your movie. and stop making such crap in name of love stories."
" This movie is actually really good, and will have you watch it a second time.
",0.4927,0.9988,2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"I'm going to start off saying that I'm really mad at the people who are saying this movie gives them headaches, and that it's boring. IT's NOT!!!!. This movie is beautiful, it has a great story of a character named Ayan played by Ranbir Kapoor. Ranbir played this character amazingly, Anushka and Aishwarya played their character really good too. This is a story about a young man who meets a girl at a party, they start kissing and chit chatting all night, and they form some kind of connection between each other which forms them to becoming good friends. Ayan starts hanging out with Alizeh, and one night at a party where they play the breakup song Ayan finds his girlfriend cheating on him with Alizeh's family friend. Which makes Ayan cry, and that scene was really funny. From that Ayan and Alizeh go on a heart break holiday to Paris. Over there they do a lot of fun stuff, and Ayan gets a feeling inside of him self about Alizeh, and he really starts to like her a lot. Alizeh dosen't have the same feelings for Ayan, but she still loves him a lot as a friend because she thinks being friends is more chilling, fun and loving than being boyfriend and girlfriend because after you break up then you don't have the same feelings about each other as you did before. During another party Alizeh meets her old lover named Ali, and she gets in a shock where she just wants to get out, and go somewhere else. Ayan starts comforting her, and he knows that if Alizeh sees Ali she will fall in love. Ali catches Alizeh and explains how much he loves her, Ayan keeps telling Alizeh to go, but finally Alizeh gets weak and goes off with Ali, leaving Ayan heart broken. He then kept calling her, but she never answered. She finally did a long time after, and tells Ayan that shes getting married to Ali in India. That call leaves Ayan emotional and mad because Alizeh spent SO much time with Ayan and accidental made Ayan have close feelings for her, and she suddenly just left and is getting married to someone else. The reaction on Ayan's face during that scene is priceless. It will make you feel the same way he is. Ayan goes to their wedding and is quiet and shocked over there. Then suddenly sings a beautiful song ""Channa Mereya"" That scene will get you emotional. He ends up telling Alizeh about his feelings for her, and after she tells him she doesn't feel the same way, he flips her off and leaves. Later on he meets Saba(Aishwarya) and he tells her the story of what happened. She ends up giving him a book with her number in it. Three months later he calls her and meets up with her. From that point they become boyfriend and girlfriend. But during the movie I had a feeling that the only reason he is going out with Saba is because she reminds him off Alizeh. Saba loves Ayan a lot, but ends up telling him to leave her sight because if she spends one more moment with Ayan she will fall in love again. Ayan runs to Alizeh and tells her again the way he feels for her, but she keeps explaining him that she loves him a lot but only as a friend because she wants to keep her relationship with Ayan forever. Ayan Doesn't get it and takes off. Ayan then starts paying more attention to his career which is singing, and gets his name noticed. He then meets Alizehs husband Ali. Ali tells Ayan that Alizeh left him 2 years ago. Ayan then runs to a place where Alizeh always goes to when ever she wants to run away from the world. Ayan then waits for her for 2 days, and then she finally comes. This scene is very emotional. Alizeh takes off her hat, and is now bald because she has cancer. This leaves Ayan heart broken again because he knows he only has a couple of time to spend with her, so they again have fun, but he still loves her, and wants to be with her. He wasted so much time loving her from the beginning, and now when he finally got her back she left forever. THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING, IT HAS A GREAT STORY OF HEART BREAKS, AND IS A DIFFERENT kind of love story. This movie is worth watching. This is the kind of movie that will have to think about it more and have you watch a second time."
" Lacking in conviction- you miss nothing but a bit of Ranbir's acting if you skip over.
",-0.0772,0.9806,2017-01-02 00:00:00,3,"The story is pretty much lost in conviction and that is the biggest pitfall of the movie. Bollywood Directors, might think as is they might be breaking new ground through dialectics on love and friendship but they have been a constant theme in cinema of every generation and many times excellently done. And the exploration itself is pretty shallow, superfluous, lacking in vigor, heart or soul thus lost in conviction. Did I say that already! You get the drift. Actors ""try"". Ranbir is best out of all. Surprisingly even Aishwarya beats Anushka in performance, who seems to be repeating same old loud characters over and over again. Fawad seems so 2 dimensional figure cut. Shahrukh did add a bit of charm."
