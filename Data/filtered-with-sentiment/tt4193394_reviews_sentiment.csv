" My opinion
",0.0,0.6802,2021-01-05 00:00:00,6,"I liked the movie didn't love it just like it here is why.
1- Main character is just stupid with all his intolerance and never being understanding and just always taking things seriously.
2- The ending is so normal, An ending of a movie should have a surprise to it.
3- They focused mostly on Markie and totally ignored the other characters especially olivia.In the end it's my opinion so please be kind."
" Almost great
",0.5868,0.8676,2020-08-26 00:00:00,9,Very well made and acted adaptation. However it should have kept more of the novel - like the gay guy's revenge and the freshmen riots. The key dialogue scenes between the hero and Dean and later with his mum are brilliantly played.
" Average !!!
",0.0,0.9511,2020-06-13 00:00:00,5,"Im honestly surprised by how high critics rated this movie! Although the film really grapples with some important ideas; the Korean War Draft, anti semitism, family dynamics, sexism, etc, etc, etc, I think that the screen play was poorly written and the acting was sub par. Everyone seemed to be playong a stereotype of themselves, and dylaogue between characters didn't feel real in the slightest. I appreciate the attempt, and I love a good love story, but if i'm honest i only got half way through the movie before I fell asleep, and I am NOT the kind of person who does that! Perhaps it does get better in the second half, though!"
" Logan Lerman

" Great movie. A must watch...
",0.6249,-0.743,2020-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Indignation is defined as anger or annoyance provoked by what is perceived as unfair treatment. One word title that captures the whole narrative.A free and independent thinker challenges the traditional foundation of his college as apparent in the intellectual fight between the dean and the male lead character. Also, the inability to tolerate intrusive roommates assigned according to the jewish faith and pressured into social groups of sorts.The clear prejudice and discrimination towards Marcus by the Dean on the basis of atheism. On matters of changing living space to the incident with his girlfriend, I can understand why there is Indignation. Accusing someone of raping someone and getting them pregnant would cause Indignation.It is relevant to today's context from mandatory chapel/praying requirement to negative stereotypes towards free-thinkers. As an atheist, I appreciate the representation. I admire Marcus' strong convention and standing up for what he thinks. It is sad to think there are a lot of people like the Dean.Finally, I would like to appreciate the slow, sweet and satisfying ending..."
" Good try
",0.4404,0.8126,2019-11-24 00:00:00,6,"Well scripted,dramatic love story with some unexpected twists. Well acted by Logan Lerma."
" Good acting. A lot good as a production. Movie couldn't commit to a theme
",0.601,0.9711,2019-01-24 00:00:00,6,"Starts with openings. Only one was necessary. Takes a bit because of this to really get into what the film is really about. And what is it about, truly?
I've never read the book so forgive me maybe missing a thing.
I heard ""life is a sum of consequences of the many choices you make""
Okay, so that's the theme? Maybe. The movie isn't sold on that.
So is it about the oppressiveness of culture, institutional religion, dangers of being open minded in the 50's? Maybe, they're surely all in there. Although it's not always clear which side the writer wants us to be on, (which I'm fine with. I actually applaud the writer for leaving debate and issues more realistically open and fairly stated)
The ending is expectedly ambiguous as to be expected with festival seeking cinema. Gotta be edgy right?
But it seemed like a dark ending for purely that sake, not because it actually was edgy or thought provoking, further than, ""what was her last name at the end?""
It skipped certain plot point scenes yet had scenes like the two unnecessary preopening scenes.
I'd still call this a ""good film"", it just seemed like a new writer with a long successful career ahead. The kind he/she looks back on and learned from the mistakes.
But what the hell do I know. They don't pay me the big bucks."

" I gave up
",0.0,0.5823,2018-10-28 00:00:00,2,"Too odd for me. None of the characters have clear motivations. They just behave oddly, create angst and over react to everything. Life really isn't as difficult as these folks make it. Made it to 50 mins then just thought life's too short for this.?"
" the bj queen
",0.0,-0.5797,2018-07-08 00:00:00,7,"It's 1951. Marcus Messner (Logan Lerman) works at his father's butcher shop. They're observant Jews in Newark, New Jersey. He is left off the Korean draft by going to college in Ohio to study law. It's a small conservative school where Jews are a small minority. He rejects the Jewish fraternity. His atheism attracts troubled Olivia Hutton (Sarah Gadon).Based on a novel by Philip Roth, this is James Schamus' theatrical directing debut. He's worked on many great movies over the years mostly under Ang Lee. I love Marcus' awkward confusion about getting a blow job. It's definitely different from anything I've seen before and it's weirdly funny. There is a strange awkwardness in the writing which I mostly attribute to the characters. There is real discomfort with the dean. There's also some disconnections. Olivia is the first to claim that Marcus is an atheist which is weird. There has to be a missing scene where they discuss religion and he comes out to her. She didn't say it as a guess and I don't think he gave it away earlier. I'm really taken with both Logan Lerman and Sarah Gadon. They are really good actors. This is an interesting first stab by Schamus but directing may not be his best skill."
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.9301,2018-06-23 00:00:00,10,"Great movie very suspenseful and entertaining, Logan's performance was amazing to watch he captured the character so well"
" Some great stuff with pedestrian stuff
",0.6249,0.9885,2017-12-10 00:00:00,6,"A very fine and very long scene in the midst of all this that warrants a large portion of the points I have given between the lead and the Dean of the college he attends. Although it had a good amount of room to be even better, it was a stellar achievement. That and the tragic ending of the hero.But much of was quite odd.Very long intro of sorts to the college kid Marcus played by Logan Lerman. Several redundant scenes where we are repeatedly shown the same thing. Problems with the parents, which I found to be irrelevant to the story as a whole. The colorful elements of the room mates that went nowhere.But this was the love story between Lerman and Sarah Gadon. Not only did the first date not take place until 40 minutes in, we have no real idea of her until the date, other than she is strikingly pretty. On top of that the character apparently asked for the date off-camera.The first date was intriguing but vague at the same time. She's a bit odd, sure. But then very quickly to the blow job.Now I know it took place in 1951 and there was an element of trying to make him overwhelmed by the actions. But he wasn't until several days after the fact. All in all, I didn't buy his apathy, even in that time frame.And she was supposedly mentally unstable, which was never really evident to me. Her scene of being very attracted to him rang false and his continual apathy was false. He was established as inexperienced and would have easily fallen under her spell.But then the whole relationship, although both charming people, was based around quite a lot of hand jobs. Yes, even though the character's mental history was presented, I did not get that from the portrayal, which is the fault of the director.Thus, I was open to a volatile relationship based on passion but was given an odd fixation on hand jobs between two reasonable people.Subsequently could have cut out the difficulties the mother was having with the kid's father. It had zero relevance to anything, was described completely in dialogue when it should have been shown and took away from the love story. I just kept thinking that the mother should give the father hand jobs.The device to get our hero kicked out of college and sent to Korea was very false. This kid had established a relationship with the Dean, whose sermons he was required to attend on a weekly basis in order to graduate. But they insisted on having him hire another student to sit in for him (as I knew that would lead to the inevitable).There was a sad poetry to the final outcome but too little, too late."
" ""Indignation"" perfectly translates Philip Roth's insightful rumination on lost innocence and unsympathetic fate.
",0.6705,0.9871,2017-11-13 00:00:00,10,"The 2016 film version of Philip Roth's novel ""Indignation"" feels genuine with a high-degree of realism in regards to both emotionally resonant acting and dialog that perfectly captures the zeitgeist of post-WWII early 1950's. Showcasing the burgeoning time period when bright & ambitious college students just began to question social-mores, testing restrictive boundaries on personal freedoms established by long-standing arbiters of authority.**Spoiler Alert** Focusing on the trials & tribulations of the intensely-bright & ambitious (though somewhat naive) 'Marcus Messner' (with expert portrayal by Logan Lerman) adjusting to student-life at the rural-provincial Mid-western college called 'Winesburg' in Ohio.Â  Marcus' family is Jewish with father being a Kosher butcher in Newark, New Jersey. But Marcus views himself as an uncompromising 'rationalist' who doesn't allow religious-strictures to hold him back from wide-ranging (and free-thinking) academic goals.Â  His intellectual-hero is not surprisingly the renowned British mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell.One contradictory aspect to Marcus' character is that even though apparently eschewing his family's Jewish religion, Marcus lives by uncompromisingly stringent ethical-standards acutely aware of even the slightest perceived hypocritical musings or thoughtless actions witnessed in the views of the people around him. Marcus' uncompromising World-view sets-the-stage for a stimulating intellectual battle of wills with the college Dean Caudwell (intensely portrayed by Tracy Letts).At first, Dean Caudwell appears genuinely concerned that Marcus is not readily conforming to college-life at Winesburg , with Marcus storming-out of his shared dorm room and subsequentlyÂ  living in isolation. This dramatic but intensely-realistic conversation matches wits of Marcus' rebellious rational-humanism against Dean's emphasis on family, faith and moral-fortitude along with an emphasis on properly 'fitting-in' (Dean is also perplexed that Marcus does not find identity, solace and strong sense of 'bonding' within his culturally-rich Jewish heritage).Â  The scene is endlessly fascinating (and relevant) as neither Marcus nor Dean Caudwell can make the slightest dent in the other's sense of moral certitude, constantly talking miles past each other.Â  There is also the mysterious Love-tangle whereby inexperienced/innocent Marcus is emotionally overpowered by the delicately-beautiful (but perhaps bit unstable) 'Olivia Hutton' (immaculately portrayed by Sarah Gadon). Initially, Marcus cannot fathom how Olivia seems to have taken an intense liking to him, even granting an unexpected/ unrequested 'favor' on their very first date that makes Marcus' head spin, requiring a bit of time for Marcus to fully comprehend what actually happened that first night. Backing away from Olivia for awhile, Marcus feels those irresistible magnetic-forces relentlessly pulling on his heartstrings in short-order.Â  There is much more to Olivia Hutton than meets the eye of course, embodying a fragile emotional complexity that is far beyond anyone's comprehension.Foreshadowing everything else in Philip Roth's historically-resonant narrative inherent to ""Indignation"" i.e. the foreboding sense that even the most rational-Logical and well-intentioned human-being can never escape the clutches of Fate and unsympathetic circumstance. Â Even Marcus' abundant capacity for 'mind-over-matter' problem-solving (along with his sincere intentions) cannot guarantee that everything will 'work-out' in the End --- and in fact, the immutable circumstances of 'history' (and especially the 'wages of War') seem to have pre-ordained Marcus' tragic fate.""Indignation"" flawlessly directed by James Schamus and brilliantly acted by Logan Lerman, Tracy Letts and Sarah Gadon superlatively rises to the occasion and presents a realistic and heartrending cinematic 'time & place' that perfectly captures Philip Roth's intriguing + insightful narrative ruminating upon the era in America when attitudes (and philosophical outlooks) really began to break-free of age-old acceptances, even shedding light on the beginnings of some of our Country's current deep-rooted political & cultural divisions (and immutable historical circumstance)."
" Now I know why I never ran headlong into Roth's novels.
",0.0,0.7843,2017-10-25 00:00:00,5,"After seeing this movie I am astounded that I myself survived at all, however marginally, after finishing my college education. Probably I shouldn't have. This film taught me way more about myself, and the diabolical twists and turns of a self-created life...than about what I was supposed to understand about what kids think about the wars raging all around them, about why Roth picked the material he wrote about, or about why some themes in life get recognized and why some don't. It's still an OK film and of course I will be reading the novel next. I assume there will be far more fine-tuned nuance there, and I also suspect I will personally feel maybe more invisible as well. Still plan to publish this reader- review and still plan to writhe through many more twists and turns in my own astoundingly improbable and invisible life. And while I'm doing that I'll probably read ""A Separate Peace"" one more time and then maybe get smug about how the movie for that book likewise failed to hold up. Or maybe I'm just obsessed on who can ""pass that inspection"" and who can't."
" Truly a Landmark Film--One for the Ages
",0.4939,-0.9784,2017-10-17 00:00:00,10,"After reading the novel and watching the film on four different occasions, I am constantly blown away. Missing from the film are the section headings in the novel, chief which is the first section, entitled: Morphine--and this gets your mind thinking one way, while by the end you realize what really happens. There are hints throughout the film, including the Korean War scene briefly at the beginning; the R.O.T.C.students parading in widely separated scenes; and by the so-called dream monologue after his surgery where he reveals the secret of the film. The film and book preset the finest dialogue I've ever heard in any recent films. The confrontations between Marcus and the Dean are priceless and appeal to thoughtful viewers everywhere.One nasty scene in the book had to be excised from the film, as it presents a sordid and incredulous display of sexual lust as Marcus' gay roommate masturbates all over Marcus' single room.Finally, who are the indignant characters in the film? One could say that nearly all the characters are indignant. Marcus is the master of indignation as he protest the manipulation of his actions by the Dean, who is co-master of indignation, as all his beliefs are debunked by Marcus. Olivia is driven to a nervous breakdown, partly because Marcus is forced to reject her. Marcus' mother is greatly indignant because of her husband's erratic behavior. The nurse who watches the hand job by Olivia. And so on.Finally, has anyone mentioned the profession of Marcus' father? Butcher. One who cuts and slices meat--just like the slaughtering in the Korean War. Nice touch!"
" This movie is horrible, Time i cant get back.
",-0.5423,-0.9751,2017-10-11 00:00:00,1,"(no spoilers in the following section) While the movie and characters are well constructed and an interesting story is told, it ultimately falls apart in a way the writers, directors and everyone involved should have known. Mistakes like these continue to be made and when the movies fail, those involved are somehow surprised. This movie barely broke 3 million dollars world wide. They failed to ask themselves ""Who in this world goes to a movie saying 'i want to leave the theater depressed as heck'"". The answer is 'Nobody'. News got around and nobody want to see this film.(spoilers follow from here, though not super specific) This movie had a path to greatness and the writers ignored it. They opted for a depressing movie, once they change gears from happy to sad, The mother blackmails the son into leaving his G/f, She gets committed and gets shock therapy and no longer seems to be... 'alive', (she lost her spark), he gets kicked out of school because the principal is a horrible person who hates atheists(violating the law in doing so) and then he dies in the Korean war because hes not in school. Its like they thought ""hay how could we make this as sad as possible? how could we ruin a great movie and loving relationships?"""
" Worth a look, but not entirely successful
",-0.6102,0.9887,2017-06-05 00:00:00,6,"I've never read any Philip Roth, but if this film is any indicator, his work may be difficult to translate to the screen. The drama in this film is very introverted. It deals with a Jewish teenager (Logan Lerman) from New Jersey who attends a liberal arts college in Ohio, becomes infatuated with a fellow student (Sarah Gadon), and finds himself beset by the various social pressures that might affect someone in his position. Some scenes work very well (an argument between Lerman and his dean, played by playwright Tracy Letts, is proof that a verbal argument can be every bit as tense as a shootout), but on the whole, the film has a staid, overly formal quality to it.Some of that is the dialogue. I'm guessing much of it is taken intact from the novel, because it sounds too ""written"" when said aloud. I understand that these characters are smart, well-spoken people, but even so, there are some scenes where it feels as if we are listening to the screenwriter rather than the characters. The direction, too, has a very restrained quality, as first-time writer-director James Schamus shoots some of the dialogue in static medium shots that few contemporary directors would use. One one hand, I admire him for not falling prey to the quick-cutting style that so many modern films employ. At the same time, this film feels a little cold.The actors, for their part, do well. Logan Lerman, who was excellent in ""Noah"", proves yet again that he is capable of conveying just as much through facial expressions and reaction shots as through speech. Some of the supporting actors don't fare as well. Perhaps that could be the writing.I can't really give this film a definitive thumbs up or thumbs down. If you are a fan of Roth's or find the idea of Jewish-born sexually active atheist railing against a society that teaches him that he should repress his true feelings, then check this film out. It's sad, contemplative, and, in its own understated way, beautiful."

" A necessary study for today's student of multiculturalism.
",0.0,0.9432,2017-05-05 00:00:00,10,"Social Sanction is a reality in our postmodern multicultural context. Daily people are asked to assimilate and in their best interest it would be easier for everyone if they found a way to do that without being compromised. Asking someone to assimilate should never be this brash a process and people need to be able to find their maturity without being patronized to the point of hospitalization. A comment was made in the behind the scenes script, 'a life and death scene' and the film itself expounds that wonderfully. A point presented with sophistication and clarity, enjoyed it from the first moment to the last."

",0.0,0.958,2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"This is nearly a perfectly executed movie. The acting by all the main characters is excellent. It is pensive and slow,but not is a way that causes the viewer to be uninterested. In fact I watched several scenes,several times.A young,very bright Jewish man receives a scholarship to a Christian college in 1951. He is openly atheist and angry he must endure chapel and thinking in general from others of a primitive thinking nature. But he is a buthcher's son and this is his chance to ve mich more,the world is at his fingertips. He,himself is young and naive,especially when it comes to women. However he meets a beautiful precocious women with some emotional problems and a reputation. Never the less he is taken with her as she is with him. The story revolves around his relationship with her as well as the students and a especially an ingratiating forcefully conservative Dean played extremely well by Tracy Letts.Many will find this too thoughtful,too pensive,too slow. It is simply not the kind of movie many usually see today. Certainly not like what most rush off to see at the theaters with 3D glasses,action,thrills and CGI. It simply isn't that kind of movie. This is what we use to call a film. This one is for the thinkers. Intelligent,disturbing,thoughtful. 4 stars."
" Good movie, but confusing
",-0.1027,-0.9564,2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"This isn't really a review. It's more of a question. But I realize I have to meet the minimum word count to get it published so I'll write a review. But first the question (and spoiler alert.) Near the end of the movie the Dean tells Marcus that Olivia is pregnant. Naive Marcus is dumbfounded and swears he can't be the father because he didn't have intercourse. All he got was a hand job from Olivia in his hospital room. So my question is: Is the viewer supposed to conclude that when Olivia went into the bathroom to wash up after servicing Marcus that she first slipped her sperm covered fingers up her vagina? Or am I imagining too much?I would have liked the movie better if the script had been clearer about this. Also quite a few scenes from the book were not in the movie. Perhaps a low budget made cuts necessary. But there were no special effects, so why the need for cuts? Especially since the movie runs well under two hours. Also the ending makes no sense at all. We are supposed to believe that Marcus dies in the Korean War after getting expelled from college and drafted. And yet this ""death"" scene is filmed indoors in some dark building; not any kind of Korean battlefield I ever saw. And even worse the enemy soldier who kills Marcus seems to be wearing a WWII Japanese uniform, complete with cap and tropic warfare sunshade. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie. The acting by all the characters was great. That's why I gave it an 8 our of 10."

",0.4404,-0.7574,2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Just as I shouldn't upvote films based on their set-pieces (*coughManchesterByTheSea*cough*), I shouldn't penalise efforts on account of their few weak spots, no matter how grandiose they might be.In this case, I'm talking about the insufferable blandness of certain scenes and the performing injustice done to the character I considered to be the most intriguing of the five big ones - Olivia. I can only theorise about the mysteries surrounding her person and it's a dear shame that the otherwise lovely Sara Gadon didn't quite manage to rise up to her muse's height.Overall, Indignation may be suffering a mild case of technical malfunctions and a somewhat inflated sense of pretentious entitlement, however, it benefits tremendously from exceptional writing, memorable performances (seriously, Linda Emond, my heart!) and a unique, tailor-fashioned application of a story-telling craft rather difficult to master -- giving the viewer more detail by simply nudging our attention towards the things chosen to be left unsaid.Severely under-watched.

Marcus had huge potential for his academic journey due to his ambitious reason to leave his small town and begin his higher education.After arriving at the college, he slowly begins to experience cultural shock. One experience after another, Marcus begins to become unease and his studies are no longer a top priority. A young beautiful woman, Olivia Hutton, distorts his thinking after she relieves Marcus from some sexual tension.Marcus' encounter with the college dean is an amazing scene. The young man displays principles he believes in and not any organized religion. The dean begins to provoke Marcus indirectly about being an atheist. As Marcus tries to retreat from the dean's office, Marcus continued to slice through the dean's attempt to make him fold. The dean would not let Marcus leave gently.Ultimately, Marcus failed to ""fit in"" and throughout the movie his reason and choices determine his unprecedented outcome, which is not college.

I only watched the whole thing because I thought the end would be magnificent. Wrong. The slow pace of this movie couldn't keep me interested. The actors were trying their best with what they had. They talked so slow throughout. Only a couple brief parts had any spark to them. Storyline was OK. I did feel as if this was 1950's based. The attire and scenery was very believable. Just couldn't keep me involved and I tried. The two main characters were developed and I wanted to see where they would go. However, I see all these rave reviews and I feel as if they watched a different movie than I did. Snoozer."
