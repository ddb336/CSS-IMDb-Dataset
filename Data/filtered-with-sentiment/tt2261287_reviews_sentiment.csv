" Doesn't offer much, but it does it well enough
",0.3919,0.9701,2021-03-14 00:00:00,6,"This looked like one of those ""cheap"" animated movies that are a bit stiff in animation and have bland storytelling. Yet, it is quite fluid and well choreographed. Also, the main beats of the story are very well done and would make for a beautiful short! A poor girl has a chance at her Ballerina dream, and works hard to attain it. Sadly there are too many ""secondary scenes"" that are too childish and annoying, in a way that are almost a detriment to the whole.. They make it feel like a patchwork of a movie that would be better if properly polished.
Still, it worked enough for me to be interested in finishing it (I quite liked the main lead and her development, even if it was convenient at times). And the models/character design is top-notch.. so it is pretty to look at at least.If you feel there is a drought of animated movies and don't know what to watch, this might help pass the time nicely."
" True Ballet
",0.4215,0.3182,2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,"I am a ballerenia and my husband found this movie for me on Netflix. I've already watched it twice. It shows the true essence of dancing and the heart of ballet. I got lost in the ballet scenes and almost started dancing on my couch. With that being said I can see why some people may have given it a lower rating, it is honestly a movie for those who have a heart for dancing."
" Not Billy Elliott nor Pixar
",0.0,0.9719,2021-02-06 00:00:00,7,"But still a really good animated movie about dreams (in life) and how to chase them. So with a social message, a love story and everything else you might want to check with a movie like this. Funny sidekicks, obstacles, evil individuals throwing everything in their path to stop our main character and so forth.The animation is ok, though I reckon for the year it might not even be near good (or could be considered that). The predictable story won't really be something the smaller ones/viewers will mind at all. Be aware of that and just enjoy the pureness this tries to convey"
" Totally cliche but has a certain charm that makes it less boring!
",0.61,0.999,2021-02-03 00:00:00,6,"Plot:An orphan girl dreams of becoming a ballerina and flees her rural Brittany for Paris, where she passes for someone else and accedes to the position of pupil at the Grand Opera house.Analysis:What if Anastasia met a cliché artist success story? Well the answer is Leap! If this plot seems familliar is mostly because it is. The very beginning will remind a lot the 1997 Anastasia movie, a redhead orphan that leaves for Paris with a boy and a music box and that's where the simillarities stop. After that it's the typical success story with the ""You can do it"" feeling.The combination of well made animation and pretty design is what makes this movie so cute and helps the viewer forgive other mistakes. Visually, this one does not only tell a classic fairtytale but also creates a beautiful world with some cute characters that look like dolls and experience Paris as the city of dreams. Big eyes, round and smooth faces, realistic world design and beautiful lighting, everything feels appropriate for kids to feel warm and adults to admire the details.The story isn't something incredible. Everyone has seen a story of someone following his dreams through the hardships of a world where he's a peasant. This one includes every cliché possible, you will probably be able to guess a big part of the movie before even watching a minute of it, a predictable and familliar story that does absolutely nothing original. To be fair, it's very pleasing and it has a cute feeling of daydreaming and those are some important things for a kids' movie. If the audience is little children it will be a blast, it has every nice feeling, it's simple and optimistic, but for adults it will be another okay experience like most of the animated films of the last few years.Another major problem is the humour, it's childish and most of the jokes don't work, there are a few moments that feel absolutely ridiculous and a certain character used a comic relief that is absolutely laughable in a bad way. Laughing at speech disorders or accents and stereotypes isn't something that should be the core of a film's comedy and that's a big foul of this movie. The last one is the music. It's obvious that kids these days will probably enjoy the pop sound that would be more appropriate of a fan-made montage than an actual movie. It will be a weird musical score for the adults from the audience who will probably be confused.Conclusion:It's a movie with a huge gap of entertainment depending on the age and the expectation. It is absolutely a perfect movie for little kids, anthemic, dreamy and simple, it does everything to entertain them but not enough to be meaningful and good for the adults too. If the purpose of this story is to be seen only as a kids movie it's a good one, if they aimed to satisfy every age it's barely okay, so my rating will be somewhere in the middle.Rating: 6.5/10"

" Not the best movie but not the worst
",0.5035,-0.7457,2020-12-02 00:00:00,6,"The movie is about a young lady named Felicie who wants to become a dancer. The movie overall is very inspiring and has a great message to it. What I am not pleased about is the acting. Yes I know this was one of Maddie's first acting experiences but she did not do too well in this film. Elle Fanning is well known and has potential but this was not her best film. I do not feel like the character voicing was right. She sounds way older for her age. Carly should not have played Oddette at all in my opinion. Maybe someone like Cameron Diaz or Catherine Keener would have played Oddette much better. It was pretty cringey, not going to lie. Victor's friend was just confusing and weird. There were some lines that should not have been said in that movie that only added more weirdness to it like ""I wet myself."" The music overall I enjoyed. Rudolph shouldn't have had an accent, it was not very suiting for me. Yet again, this is my opinion and I just did not care for it too much."
" Cringey but good animation, etc
",0.5927,0.9712,2020-11-29 00:00:00,3,"You can tell that this was written by a man. Has potential and also has great animation and cool dance sequences, but unrealistic storyline/timeline and very cheesy and clunky writing. The soundtrack is odd also because it's way too poppy and loud for the context. Hated what this teaches about male/female relationships also- the childhood male friend treats the protagonist poorly because she doesn't want to date him and then SHE ends up having to apologize in order for him to stop ghosting her. And he keeps calling her his girlfriend even though she is clearly not. It's really possessive and toxic when there's no reason for it- they should be able to keep a healthy friendship to set a better example for kids with close friends of the opposite gender. Anyways, I was entertained by the movie but I just wish it was less cringey."
" Inspirational Kids Film!
",0.5562,0.9971,2020-11-27 00:00:00,10,"This was the best movie i have seen all month!!! The characters were creative and gave me all kinds of emotion, love, joy, anger, surprise, excited, over and over. The girl, Félicie, was not able to dance at first, but she had the love and passion, which already made her better then any of the kids at the dance school. All she needed was someone to teach her, someone who saw that raw passion, love, and talent for dancing. Her friend, victor, had dreams of his own and where they might not have been fulfilled, he was on the right path to becoming a great inventor and I loved it. Now Félicie had stolen the identity of a girl who had hopes of going to the dance school, she was spoiled and rude, but her mother was the source and was overall crazy. One thing I would want added to the movie is what happened to the mother of that spoiled girl at the end, even if it was in the credits. That aside I absolutely loved this movie. Leap was very inspiring, so much I thought of doing MY FIRST REVIEW EVER on it. Can't wait tell its on DVD, I might see it again before then because this is a movie worth watching over and over, bring joy to my heart."
" Wonderful Film with a Big Meaning about Never Giving up on Your Dreams
",0.6558,0.9977,2020-11-27 00:00:00,10,"Leap! is a great film with a big meaning. This film teaches it all - honesty, perseverance and the importance of practice, family, believing in yourself, believing in your dreams and passion. Felicie makes a lot of mistakes during her journey, which set her back, but that doesn't stop her from continuing to push through.The story begins when Felicie and her best friend, Victor escape from an orphanage. They take a train to Paris so that Felicie can attend a dance school there and Victor can become an inventor. They arrive in Paris without any money. During their journey, they encounter many challenges. As Felicie meets new people, a love conflict arises as well as a conflict with a wealthy lady who is pure evil and wants to crush Felicie's dream.A wealthy woman Regine (Kate McKinnon) is cruel, rude and arrogant, but a boy with a crush on Felicie protects her from Regine. McKinnon makes Regine sound totally wicked in a bad but great way. The boy, Victor (Natt Wolf) is portrayed as a timid, but an optimistic and caring friend.The animation in this film is spectacular! It is very detailed and their mouths move with the words they are saying so well the animated characters seem real. The voice acting is spot on. The voices are filled with emotion and an inspiration to the audience, including me.My favorite part is when Felicie watches a ballerina at the French dance school. She takes just one look at the ballerina's dance and knows she wants to dance and that she can dance. You can really see Felicie's passion for dancing right there. The whole movie is all about passion and the movie will inspire viewers to follow their dreams.The message of this film is to follow your dreams. It show how, in order to succeed, you have to work very hard, believe in yourself and have passion. Felicie is an exemplary role model.Leap! is a very inspirational film with a very important lesson and a pleasure to watch. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 3 to 18. Adults will love this movie as well. I really enjoyed watching this film."
" Tchaikovsky, Tchaikovsky, Tchaikovsky
",0.0,0.9085,2020-11-21 00:00:00,5,"(Review based on watching the English-language version ; there also seems to exist a French-language version which may not be entirely identical.)To begin with the good, this animation movie contains images of great beauty. This is especially the case when the scenes show (parts of) ballet performances or rehearsals. It is clear that the various makers of the movie paid close and respectful attention to the actual accomplishments of actual ballet dancers. It is also clear that they took the time to poke around in real-life opera houses.However, I'm convinced that the movie would have been vastly improved, both emotionally and narratively, by investing in a story more grounded in reality. Here you've got a tale about a destitute orphan girl who's never so much as put on a ballet shoe - and don't you know it, within a matter of days she's besting well-fed, well-trained, well-exercised rivals, because she's got, like, so much drive. (AND she's got red hair. Never underestimate the importance of red hair for brave and enterprising orphan girls.) Why not give us a story about a girl from a modest background who receives some ballet lessons, arrives in the big city, and discovers that her new teachers consider her training hopelessly old-fashioned and provincial ?And of course you get this huge cliché, where classical ballet music equals Tchaikovsky. Not an evil word against Mr. Tchaikovsky, who wrote some of the most enchanting ballet music in history, but why drag him in again and again and again ? Watching movies like these, one sometimes gets the impression that a Drigo, a Minkus, a Massenet, a Gounod or a Saint-Saëns lived and died in vain. It's simple laziness, especially since there exist enough technical consultants who would be able to indicate, with laser-like precision, the kind of works most suitable to that specific era and setting."
" Muy lindo y emocionante

" Bland
",0.0,0.0,2020-10-22 00:00:00,5,"The animation was floppy, the plot and characters were cliche, and overall the whole thing had a fast-paced low-budget feel to it. Not to mention that the character's behavior and clothing didn't make sense for the time period."
" Touches the heart of those who have dance as their passion
",0.4588,0.9958,2020-10-02 00:00:00,8,"Movie was a really good attempt as a 3D animation but that was not the center, it was Dance. It successfully conveys that message for the passion of dance. Movie was a bit dreamy but charming, I am glad that I watched this, as being a dancer myself.This movie not just shows a little girl's love for dance but many more moral values like you can work hard all along and just one mistake even when you are one step away from achieving your dream can make you loose it. Distractions will always be there but if you really want it, you will get it and no matter how big your dream is and how small you are now, you will achieve it.Movie is a must watch for anyone who loves to dance, especially if you have/had your struggle to be a dancer. For those people it really connects to the heart. Taking the location to Paris is such a great decision.All the characters were good and story too. Overall I would recommend everyone to go for it. If you love dance I am sure you will like to watch it one more time."
" Fine for little kids, but entirely derivative
",0.1027,0.9777,2020-09-29 00:00:00,4,"Ballerina (which was later renamed ""Leap!"") feels like a made-for-TV or direct-to-video animated movie. It is entirely unoriginal, which makes it 100% predictable. You have a young orphan who dreams of being a dancer, and by chance she stumbles into a prestigious dance studio and gets the opportunity to live out her dreams, but it won't come without some hard work. You can write the movie for them after that and you would probably come out with the exact same film they offered up. It has no surprises, and the characters are as deep as a wading pool. Of course we also have to suffer through a young ""romance' that is full of awkward moments and no real display of affection (since they are kids.) The movie doesn't look half bad, and I feel like the animators took a fair amount of time studying actual ballerinas in order to get the dance moves to look right. In every way Ballerina delivers what you would expect, but that also means it will give people what they want if this is the type of movie they were seeking to watch with their kids. It's not one of the smarter kids movies that is built to entertain the parents who are watching as well, but it is competent enough that I could see some young ones wanting to watch it on repeat. As a middle-aged man with no kids, though, it's clearly not for me."

" A nice tale about following your dreams
",0.6705,0.994,2020-05-22 00:00:00,9,"I've always liked the theme of following your dreams no matter what others say. That theme is nicely shown in Leap! It's a lovely movie about two friends who run away from their orphanage in rural Brittney to Paris. Felice wants to be a Ballerina, and despite lacking formal training, she loves to dance, and she gets better at it at a prestigious dance school in Paris. Victor wants to be an inventor, and likes to come up with and make new inventions. Both protagonists are passionate about what they do, and that's an admirable trait when it come to protagonists in films. There's a heartfelt redemption towards the end, a villain who's great at being bad, interesting supporting characters, great dialogue and storytelling, and fun entertainment that's sure to amuse you."
" LOVE ITTTT
",0.6369,0.9384,2020-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I'm not completely sure how many times I have seen this movie now, my best guess would be over 10 times. This film is absolutely brilliant and deserves nothing less than 10 stars. The animation is adorable and I love the style. The characters are unique and different."
" Millennial is transported back in time
",0.0,-0.6927,2020-04-01 00:00:00,3,"A young millennial girl is transported back in time where she finds herself in a french orphanage in the late 1800s with nothing but a passion to dance. She escapes the orphanage and with no formal training whatsoever she finds herself at the premier ballet school in Paris and possibly the world. Luckily for her, she finds herself living with a cleaning lady who suffered a career ending ballet accident. With the help of the cleaning lady, she practices for a week and outperforms the students that have literally been studying the art their entire lives. In the process the cleaning lady finds an adopted daughter, a boyfriend and a whole new reason to live."
" Beautiful and funny

" A Delightful Escape
",0.6705,0.8625,2020-03-19 00:00:00,9,"I love this underdog story. Set aside your ""adultting"" mind for a little while and just enjoy the story. It's light, inspiring, delightful and humorous. The movie gives you hints of her potential intermixed with the frustrated look at how hard she has to work to overcome the difference of years of training she's unfortunately lacking.By the time she makes her final grand jete, I practically had happy tears in my eyes. As you try to find entertainment for your kids during this period of social reclusion (or even if you don't have kids and want a light ""feel good"" movie), don't skip this one.If I have one criticism, it's that the villain is a bit darker than I was expecting to have to explain when I first watched it with my daughters back in 2016 (then 3 and 4). Sure, villains are supposed to be villains, and I can assure you that this one is."
" Pleasantly surprised

I wasn't expecting much, but it's a lovely film.I really enjoy this type of animation, the people behind this do a good job with it. More goodness comes with the music, which Klaus Badelt expertly crafts - the songs from pop culture are astutely chosen.Lastly, the casting is nothing special though Elle Fanning and Carly Rae Jepsen give decent performances."
" Wonderful heartfelt family film
",0.802,0.9382,2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,This film is about reaching your dreams after doing some scary things to get there including leaving your comfort zone. I loved the relationships in the movie. The dynamics were perfect for a children's movie. This is one of my new favorite movies. Leap really touched my heart.
" If I were a professional balerina I would be offended
",-0.25,-0.264,2019-12-01 00:00:00,4,"So basically if you want hard enough to be a balerina, you can be one in a single week, with no prior education, you just have to lie to achieve it. No way, this makes any sense nor in any way it is a good message for kids. (They wouldn't notice I'm sure)
Also am I the only one who thinks the music was inapropriate? Cutsie millenial music choices just made the whole movie worse, why did they not choose some classical music? They did not even put the Nutcracker music to the last scene, where they are supposed to dance that.
It could have been a cute movie if they did some sense and fact check before production."
" They are 11 years old, right?
",0.0,0.9049,2019-11-17 00:00:00,3,"I wasn't the target audience, was I? Regardless I watched this movie because I'm a fan of ballet related stories. I thought this would be a good story about overcoming problems of being a ballet dancer, buuuuut I was wrong.Where do I begin with this movie? It does have ballet in it, but it's like maybe the creators watched very little about ballet and felt like they knew enough? I just don't like how this movie portrays ballet out to be a joke. I understand it's a movie, but it's not something you can just start for a few days and then become a star. It's not realistic since the story feels like it takes place in just a few weeks.The character voices just didn't match AT ALL. The two main characters Felicie and Victor just sound WAAAY too old. I had to double check the characters ages and they're supposed to be 11 or 12. That's another thing that bothers me. Victor was very cringy. He had no real backstory other than being this 11 year old who wants to get into his childhood friends pants. What? When I was 11, I just wanted to play video games. I didn't care about girls.The main girl, Felicie, wants to be a ballerina, but it's laughable how just know absolutely nothing about it. I understand she's an orphan but it just doesn't really give much weight to her desire to become a dancer.The constant use of pop songs instead of classical pieces annoyed me so much.The humor wasn't good, and actually very cringy too.For an hour and a half movie it felt a lot longer than it should. I got nothing out of it. Even the supposed moral story is bad. Steal and pretend to be someone else to get your foot in the door. Uh-huh... This movie is just uninteresting type of Karate Kid movie. Avoid this one."

Although I didn't like normalisation of identity theft and very predictable ending, it's a good story about friendship, chasing your dreams and being strong in desperate moments. I see some critics about historical inaccuracies. Come on folks, many people still don't know the Statute of Liberty was built by France. If we look into historical details in every movie, the list never ends. Again some critics were about referrals to popular culture, I guess the same people would prefer references to the 19th century France as if they lived that time...It keeps my daughter and her friends entertained and 8 points goes on behalf of her..."

" Maybe don't leap to see it but you could do worse
",-0.631,0.9748,2019-09-19 00:00:00,8,"An oddly likeable little romp that will appeal to the 8 year old girl in all of us.What it lacks in originality and finesse it makes up for in heart and passion. Indeed it is one of THOSE movies, where the passionate amateur finds that basically their devotion gives them the edge over all the others with the technical skill.The incredibly adorable heroin, who combines the best aspects of femininity and masculinity, pursues her dream in the enchantingly autumnal Paris with her male best friend.It annoys me how this movie perpetuates the idea that all young boys revel in their own bodily functions and that even with a female protagonist she is the one being fought over rather than competing for the romantic interest.But I know that I will watch it again one day... if you're that kind of adult that is perversely fascinated in how modern little girls think you'll get something from it.The textures and character animation is fantastic."

" Lie, cheat, steal, & be rewarded? Great lesson taught here.
",0.2732,-0.6481,2019-06-10 00:00:00,3,"As long as the person who has done you wrong is an awful person, it's acceptable to lie, cheat, & steal, especially if you're fulfilling your dreams? It's never acceptable to do any of these things yet here we have this lesson all wrapped up in ballerina slippers & a tutu.Do we even still wonder nowadays, why children are growing up with less & less morals, accountability, and concern for others? When you can wrap immorality, unaccountably, selfishness, self-focus, & greed in such a pretty package, is it any wonder what kinds of people we'll soon be dealing with in our society?If you value morals & teach them to your children, do not expose your children to this film; it will undermine your family's values."
" Unexceptional.
",0.0,0.9858,2019-06-09 00:00:00,4,"As a dancer I may be biased, but I feel really strongly that this film missed almost every mark. Three minutes in I was able to tell my 7 year old niece exactly how the movie was going to play out and found myself pointing out how this character was *not* actually the heroine but rather a poor example of how one should treat people and how you do NOT chase your dreams. The eye rolling became painful.The few decent ideas within the movie were lost somehow in the editing or flow... the idea that the music box dream would eventually play out so she could discover her passion's source and answer her ""why"" was the entire point of the story arc, but you didn't realize that until you were actually watching it and even then you had to be paying attention or it was missed. The creepy eyed guy saving her was a great twist but played out without enough oomph.For me the most disappointing aspect was that it almost seemed to take the inherent beauty of the storyline: the idea that ballet is magical and exquisite; turn of the century architecture and references to epic artistic monuments; classical music and cultural history... which are sorely lacking and is incredibly needed in today's plastic ridden upbringing... and cheapened them beyond repair. ANY dancer would be offended by the idea that a person can gain enough momentum in a week's worth of training to be even remotely adequate and goes way beyond artistic license. Half of the dancing was weird and mundane ""modern"" type garbage that you expect from the lower quality X's Got Talent auditions and the bubble gum pop music that was used instead of the classical was horrendously unfortunate on all levels. The idea of introducing the storyline of Victor in Gustav Eiffel's shop could have been brilliant and brought out so many wonderful ideas, but was utterly wasted, as were most of the characters' back stories.One has to choose their narrative. Are you catering to a less cultured, heavily top 40s radio laden group of easily influenced teeny bopper sheep with a story and actors they already know and feel safe with? Or are you offering something that introduces a higher level of intrigue, both from quality storytelling and true artistic merit? Such a terribly missed opportunity."
" It Was Okay
",0.2263,0.9375,2019-04-10 00:00:00,6,I thought that this film was rather good and I loved the friendship and how determined the children were in getting their dreams as well as how great the animation of this film was. However I feel there was more that they could have done with the movie and it was rather lacking and the villain was not original at all.
" Great film!
",0.6588,0.9039,2019-02-23 00:00:00,9,Stumbled across this gem on Amazon. Perfectly pitched for the kids and adults will find it very easy viewing.The story isn't overcomplicated and follows an orphaned dancer with the odds stacked against her. A work hard message that we can all relate to.Also incredibly refreshing to find an animated film that hasn't had the producer/writer use as an opportunity to pepper with angry feminist one-liners.Finally - excellent soundtrack! Will buy blu ray if it's available.
" Exceptional movie, hits the feels
",0.0,0.7893,2019-02-18 00:00:00,8,"I believe this movie was hit way too hard by critics. It's an incredibly ""feel good"" movie, and the story was well thought out. The animation was top notch, the score was well done, the characters were spot on, and it really makes you root for the under-dog. A lot of emotion was put into this film, and I think it would be a welcomed addition to anyone's collection."
" Leap! Hits the Mark
",0.0,0.9839,2019-01-10 00:00:00,8,"26 August 2017. Some people have criticized this movie because of the stealing scene. For those sensitive enough to have moral qualms about this criminal act and this movie, might just as well also condemn the Best Oscar Motion Picture Les Miserables (2012) for stealing wood in that movie. Subsequently, this criminal act has its consequences. Really for an animated children's movie the morality of the criminal is not as clear cut as it might seem as well. As for those critics whose insistence on historical accuracy and the relatively quick learning curve to become an amazing dancer are missing the nature of this fun, entertaining, in some ways simplistic presentation of an animated feature for young girls who still have dreams and a few boys who want to be inventors ala the prat fallen and accident-prone acclaimed comedian, Jerry Lewis, who died recently at 91 years old. And finally, dancing in a pub as a young girl can't be looked down on if one realizes this is a European setting where society isn't so prudish and the association of pubs (where family often gather) and bars is often confused.The use of animation in this movie was aptly chosen and is fined tuned to the spirited nature of the storyline, particularly the dancing moves which would have been quite unrealistic and poorly received if the movie had been live action instead. The animated dancing offers up a childlike fantasy experience of exciting idealistic movement and the fulfillment of the delicious pleasure of passionate dreams. There is an excellent but difficult and rarely achieved balance between animated realism and the girlish imagination of what could and is possible as seen through a child's eyes such like Bolt (2008) about a performance dog who believes his acting is part of his real persona. The landscapes, the buildings, cityscapes are often presented with vibrant authenticity yet with a sense of wondrous imperfection as animation as yet hasn't been able to completely replicate dense photographic images of the real world.In some ways, Leap! could be consider the young child's version of La La Land (2016) or Chicago (2002) in its depiction of the entertainment world, its exotic sights and sounds, the captivating energy and the enthralling emotional turmoil and the pulsating excitement of art. This great movie is about not giving up passion and pursuing one's dreams, who better message can an animated feature offer children?"
" Might be okay for the 7 and under crowd.

So you can become a ballerina in a few weeks? This was rediculous even by animated feature standards.If you're the one of the ""greatest dancers of her generation"" and you get injured, you become the cleaning lady? Even if you don't get injured, Is the message that life is over once you're done dancing, but hey, go for it anyway? You can't even become a proper paid teacher? You have to do it in your spare time between the dishes and mopping the floors?I thought maybe she would somehow sneak into the school, start in the baby class and be really tall and clumsy, with a montage of her slowly becoming the same height as her peers. At least have the audition something they're working towards over a few months, but days? It's honestly insulting to the other girls in the movie who've been working for years. I get it that people are talented, passionate, and driven and reach their dreams in record speed, but sheesh.I wasn't aware the Nutcracker is performed in the summer or that Clara at any time wears a crown and Pointe shoes. Speaking of Nutcracker, we sure didn't hear much of it in a movie supposedly revolving around getting to play Clara. What's with the pop music?Ugh. Characters were underdeveloped. Too many side characters. Too many unnecessary scenes and at the end of the day, it equates becoming a ballet dancer with the Karate Kid. It doesn't work."

The writing stinks. They use modern day slang like ""sucks"", its packed with historical inaccuracies, the audio for the voices is garbage, the modern pop music doesn't belong, it's set in France yet only one person has a french accent, no one speaks french, the motivations and decisions from all the characters don't make any sense, and why the hell doesn't Felicie ever change clothes?! She's either in a tutu or jean shorts over tights like she's in an episode of Friends.
The only saving grace is that my daughter watched it once and fell in love with dancing. she dances along with every dance scene and loves going to dance class after watching it.

Anyway, i thought it was pretty good. For a Netflix original type movie anyway. It kept my interest, however at the end when Camille's mom goes utterly crazy and starts trying to kill everyone and throwing ridiculous phrases like ""it's hammer time"" that completely ruined the entire movie for me. Like are you serious? Of course she was this mom who was living through her daughter throughout the movie, and that is believable. But they had to make her completely psycho too? Completely unnecessary. And it BARELY has a resolution to that fiasco... They just were too lazy to look for a good climatic ending."
" Worst animated film I've ever seen
",-0.6249,0.9013,2018-07-08 00:00:00,1,"I expected this movie not to be good, but I wasn't expecting to hate it this much. Leap follows the story of a girl who runs away from an orphanage with her friend and wants to become a ballerina. Pretty predictable, by the numbers poor girl chasing her dreams story. It is so painfully clear that no one gave a crap about this movie, it just screams cheap and lazy. The characters are wooden and boring, and the story is so dull that you just don't care about it. There are great animated movies out there, just look at The Incredibles or Nemo or Cars, and those movies are great because yes they're fun and entertaining, but they also invested in development and characters. This movie just doesn't care about investing in the things that make a movie great. It's very clear what this movie is, it's a poorly thrown together mess that was dumped into theaters to try to make some money. 1/10."
" This is odd

I enjoyed this movie, although I will admit it was clichéd at times. It tells the story of a girl who escapes from an orphanage to become a ballerina in Paris. The characters are quite likeable and the animation is very nice. What I like the most is how realistic this film is. It's rare that you see an animated film that's completely normal.It turns out the rich bully is only that way because of her mother. Dang, I've seen this happen in ""Gravity Falls"" and ""My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic"", so it must be a trope by now. Minor character Nora steals every scene she's in with funny dialogue. I'm glad I know my history because the movie got a lot of things wrong about the year 1879. It's still a beautiful film that really is pretty unique. Not one of the best movies ever made, but definitely good. ***"

I suspect that someone told them they needed to start with an exciting scene with lots of action, so this is what happened... Nevermind the beginning, once the kids get to Paris things start to shape up and an actual narrative emerges. Nothing too revolutionary here, in terms of story or plot, but solid work."

She runs away to Paris and manages to join the Paris Opera Ballet, making an enemy of Camille and, especially, Camille's mother. With the lead role in The Nutcracker at stake, Felicie has to pick her steps very carefully.This French-Canadian CGI feature proceeds exactly as you would expect it to, with Felicie meeting jeopardy at every turn yet, somehow, overcoming all obstacles through her own endeavours and with the help of friends. At no point was there a single moment where I thought ""Well, I wasn't expecting that.""But this is not a fair criticism. As a solo male cinemagoer of mature years, I have sat among audiences where I did not belong - raunchy middle-aged matrons in Magic Mike, knicker-wetting teenage girls in Twilight - but I have seldom felt more out of place than among a cinema full of pree-teen little girls from ballet schools. Yet they are the audience at whom this film is aimed.And, on that basis, it is very good. Voiced in the English language version by Elle Fanning, Felicie is a nicely realised audience-identification figure: likeable, a little bit naughty at times, bags of pluck and application, she is so well presented that I identified with her, and I am as far outside the target demographic as it is possible to be!The dancing is also nicely done and takes advantage of being animation in order to push it beyond reality, not to the extent that it becomes outlandishly realistic, but enough to give it a ""Wow!"" factor.Camille's mother is a psychopathic attempted murderer, but we'll gloss over that, shall we?This is a very effective - and enjoyable - movie for little ballet-dancing girls, and I enjoyed it quite a bit myself. I'm not sure what that says about me, though...."

I can't believe I spent a whole Friday morning watching this, but I'm also whistling time writing this review. I just want the servant dancer and the dance teacher to fall in love. And they kissed.

",0.0,0.992,2018-04-29 00:00:00,9,"A beautiful movie altogether. The characters and the city of Paris look fantastic. The story is somewhat predictable, yes, but that does not take away from the charm of the film.
 I was also very surprised by how accurately the scene in which Felicie's eyes tear up was animated. Not tears falling down the cheeks but the actual redness of the eyes as they fill up with tears is moving.
 Another great thing about the movie is it is clearly and completely Felicie's story. There are many side characters but they compliment to the story of Felicie. It would have been a bad decision to add a side story for Viktor or anybody else. Now the focus is on the main character all the time - a brave and excellent decision.
On the negatives, the outside action scene at the end is pointless and a bit embarrassing (gladly it's a short one) and the casting of the voices of Felicie and Viktor is not great. I actually preferred the version that was dubbed into my own language.
 But aside from that, I enjoyed the movie and wanted to spend more time with the characters."

" It's fine for kids, adults have seen it before
",0.2023,0.9634,2018-04-07 00:00:00,5,"I just got done watching this with my daughter. It really is a beautifully animated movie with a strong art direction. The artists clearly did a lot of research into studying how dancers move. I think kids will enjoy it, but if you've been watching movies for any number of years then you have seen this movie hundreds of times already. It's insanely formulaic... the main protagonist grows up in the slums with nothing but a music box and a dream... a string of convenient and preposterous events that take her right to the top, every other character in the movie has little to no character development and are simply there to play the Greek chorus to Felicie's interests and push her along her way. Any time when the writers need to get Felicie from point A to point B they bring it any number of the side characters they have introduced thus far (who apparently have zero life) and magically whisk Felicie away to her destination. There's lots of ""Whooooooo""-ing in this film. There's an end sequence I won't spoil her but I'm pretty sure one of the writers said, ""It's not necessary to the story, but we haven't used enough kid movie tropes yet so let's make a ridiculous action scene that makes zero sense."" I can handle a lot of kid movie stupidity, but my jaw gaped slightly from how over-the-top it is.I also wanted to make a special point to say that the voice acting is really uninspired. There is not attempt at all to bring the audience into the time period or the fact that this takes place in Paris. Imagine your next door neighbor walking up to you and saying, ""That suck, bro."" And now take that and put it into a movie that takes place during Napoleonic France. To be fair, as a 30 year old man I'm sure I'm not the target audience for this film. If you like dancing, are a kid, don't care about original stories, then I think you'll enjoy this movie."

And I sent some videos of the ballerinas dancing's to my friend who is a ballerina and she says the steps were not correct and not even close to the real thing. This movie was laughable because of how awful it was. It showed a message of lying and cheating is ok and that you'll still achieve your dreams even if you're doing something bad to get it. It also shows that it's ok to ignore and not care about your friends. Felicie ignores Viktor literally every time he talks to her, but he still tries to be friends with her. It's kind of a toxic relationship. This movie was just. Awful. Plus the voice actin was bad. I would give it 0 stars if I could"

From the miscast voice actors, to the cheesy dialogue and typical plotline, this movie was just plain bad. The characters were flat and boring, starting off with Felicie who had no concern for her friends, and Victor who was just labeled as the possible love interest but was pushed to the side to being made as the ""lovable"" sidekick with all lf his antics and fart jokes, to the typical mysterious old lady who decides to mentor the young student because they see ""potential"". And by the way, Rudi, the actual love interest is introduced, and then forgotten for the rest of the movie. There were a lot of unnecessary scenes, and the only thing that was nice and that I liked about this movie was it's gorgeous visuals. Otherwise, the dialogue was terrible and the voice actors were terribly casted ( no disrespect, rather they just didn't fit their roles, save for the director and Rudi ) and the music choices were poor. The plot was terrible, and teaching children that you should do anything - literally anything, even if that means lying and cheating your way into achieving your goals is terrible. Not to mention that this movie also shats on ballet itself. Ballet is a difficult thing to do, and it takes literal years for dancers to earn pointe shoes. A lot don't even get them. How long did it take this young girl who has never had training to get them? A few weeks to months, which by the way, if you are unaware, at the least, a young dancer should be dancing for two years before even attempting pointe. I understand this is a kid's movie, but it should also be realistic if it's going to say to be passionate about your dreams, because quite frankly, passion is great and beautiful, but it won't get you anywehere if you don't have the patience to nurture it."

" Ehhhh conflicted
",0.0,0.9951,2018-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Pros/Neutrals:
Nice animation, settings, and it does have a bit of charm to it which I like. Main plot isn't unique in itself of it being a competition, but it's obvious that the movie is not aiming to really be anything more. A lot of other elements were ""meh"" and just run-of-the-mill things you would expect in a movie with a lower budget than this. Choreography was great to watch (even if it was just animated and not being really danced to). Being a dancer myself this movie appealed to me and has biased my score to be more positive (whoops).Cons:
The main character can be rude and underhanded, and every time she does a high-pitched squeal I had to cover my ears. The dialogue was cringy and unnatural at times. You could pretty much guess the entire plot 20 minutes into the movie. One of the love interests (Rudi) seems to be completely forgotten and we don't get any closure towards the end as to what happened to him; they practise dancing in the same building, and yet we still don't hear anything from him. Victor being the the mandatory farting and bumbling character was overused and got tiring. Some of the soundtrack was jarring, especially when Confident by Demi Lavato came on during a ballet dancing scene. Really, pop songs in a movie about ballet? Maybe if they were somewhat appropriate for their time and/or not too obviously there to just ""relate to the kids"" it wouldn't be too bad. None of them were really even remotely fitting tone-wise except for some of the lyrics coinciding with the scene.Final thoughts:
It looks as if the word count of the cons would outweigh the pros and I would be giving Ballerina a lower score, but honestly the pros were pretty good. I liked the animation, the models, the environments, the dancing, and it had a bit of charm to it. Watch and groan at times, and be pleasantly surprised in others."
" Leap!
",0.0,0.9947,2018-01-06 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie, in spite of (or, perhaps, because of) its anachronistic soundtrack, overreliance on action sequences and contemporary themes (""it's a dance-off!""), and misplaced dialogue (""it's Hammer Time!""). The movie is visually and thematically beautiful. It's all heart, and that sentiment matches one of its clichéd, but always compelling core themes--that heart is key, especially in art. I don't know anything about ballet (I've only ever seen ""The Nutcracker"" live, which I've always enjoyed)--but, with a seven-year-old daughter and a three-year old son, I've seen tons of animated films lately, and this one is up there with the best of them. It really gets the essence of childhood right: the wonder, the danger, the innocence, the yearning, the awkwardness, the excitement. It also strikes a nice balance between art as competition and art for its own sake (whereas, films like ""Whiplash"" succeed by embracing an extreme). Set in an adventurous place and time--late nineteenth century Paris, when the Eiffel Tower and Statue of Liberty were being constructed--""Leap!"" is funny and touching, upbeat and offbeat, and makes you want to go for broke and follow a dream, another of its core themes that smartly emanates from young, wide-eyed central characters who have nothing to lose. The end finds love and heart triumphant, and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world."
" Not all it's ""nutcracked"" to be...
",0.0,0.9971,2017-12-22 00:00:00,6,"Just because a theme is timeless doesn't mean you should expect it to work every time. ""Ballerina"" (or ""Leap!"" for the English title) is another Cinderella story crossed with a sports/competition-themed narrative, delivering the oh-so cherished message that a passion is worth fighting for no matter what, and that all it takes is to put your heart in it. Fine, tell me something I didn't know.At first, it looked like something I could really enjoy, Felicie, the 11-year old orphan girl dreams to become a ballerina then thanks to a strike of luck (of the sneaky sort but I liked it) , she finds a way to the Opera, then a mysterious cleaner with the grace of a ballet dancer but a limp that screams ""failed dream"" puts her up, and trains her.And then, well, I quickly realized that there was nothing in the film, I hadn't seen before. Except maybe for the superb rendition of a 3D Paris circa 1880's (when the Eiffel Tower was in construction) and a magnificent use of lighting during the dance sequences. Let's make it clear, the animation is top notch and has nothing to envy from a Pixar movie. But a lesser look with a better story would have been better, Felicie's journey doesn't do justice to its mesmerizing visuals and can only offer a series of predictable plot elements where the heroine will learn about losing and falling at least ten times before making a climactic grand jeté or spinning on a roof. It doesn't even do justice to the character of Felicie who seems to have a certain edge over the usual heroines, she's not perfect, she lies, she might even sound too ""modern"" for the film, but overall, her actions are only commanded by the usual script requirements whose purpose is to postpone the inevitable triumph, much to our frustration.We know there will be a final showdown between Felicie and her nemesis, rich blonde girl who's pushed by her tyrannical mother, we know that it will all be a matter of ""heart"" rather than technical or physical training, and there will also be a moment where Felicie will say one word too many (to hurt Odette) and get punished by Karma. I expected better than refusing to practice the night before the final test just because the Russian jock told her she was ""unique"" and wanted to go out for the night, and of course, she had to tell her Odette that she wasn't her mother. Still, it took was to say ""I'm sorry"" but this film is as dully predicable as Rocky sequel. They have to make the right mistakes at the right moments.""Ballerina"" features other clichés such as the good-looking boyfriend, of course the fat insecure sidekick (with glasses) and the villainous mother who goes literally over the top once the film had founded a rather good resolution. I was wondering whether they needed some extra time or if the directors felt the film lacked action but they didn't even try to be innovative by keeping focused on the dance. No, had to be a "" Fatal Attraction"" confrontation with a Deus Ex Machina last-minute rescue from Felicie's best friend. Did the mother really think she could kill Felicie and get away with it? It's a real shame that a movie that could have encouraged vocations and provide many lessons about life had to be so formulaic to the point of emulating action movies.I don't mean it had to be like ""Black Swan"" either but a better effort on the writing could have really helped it. And another aspect that bothered me, I don't know if it's also the case for the English version but the French version used an adult voice that was too low-pitched for a little girl, not to mention that she was talking like a 2000's teenager even saying such expressions as OK that could have been said by a girl in the 1880's Paris. Well, maybe that anachronism was deliberate and I'm looking too far but that's because I really wanted to enjoy it. The film successes in the most difficult part, it looked great but it should have embraced its own message about discipline and write more extra drafts to add some density to the story and makes the characters or the situations a little less two dimensional."

A film about a girl dreaming to become a ballet dancer made by companies from both Canada and France and also dubbed into English, and sadly it doesn't really work at times. The movie does some aspects really well, but it also does some really badly. Here's what exactly happened.In the late 1880's, an orphan girl named Félicie (Elle Jones) runs away with her best friend Victor (Nat Wolff) to Paris to follow their dreams with the latter dreaming to become an inventor and the former destined to be a ballerina. They both become separated and Félicie eventually runs into a cleaner with a limp named Odette (Carly Rae Jepsen) who allows her to stay with her as a cleaner. She continues to do this until her music box, the only thing she owns from her mother, is destroyed by a snooty, bratty ballerina named Camille (Maddie Zeigler) who is the daughter of a famed restaurant owner (Kate McKinnon). Jealous, she intercepts a letter from the Paris Opera Ballet pretending to be Camille in hopes of becoming a famed ballerina. Knowing of her trick to get in, Odette decides to secretly trains Félicie in hopes that she can stay in the class and get to dance on stage with a famed ballet dancer in The Nutcracker.I think it's interesting to note the different reception that the original French version and the American dub are receiving. Where the French version stands at a pretty good 74% on Rotten Tomatoes, the American one is at a pretty weak 37% and it's honestly not hard to see why. I'll go over the good parts of the film first. The story is actually pretty good. Though it did have a very rushed beginning, it gradually improved over time and I at least could care about the characters and dilemmas they were going through, particularly the relationship between Félicie and Odette who I'll get to in a minute. The animation is absolutely stunning. It really is beautiful and I particularly loved looking at the very detailed backgrounds of Paris. Some of the characters are fine. Félicie was very nice and had some charm to her and Odette was actually a pretty good wise mentor character even though I've seen it before so many times. Now let's get to the bad stuff, and there is a lot. The biggest one I should get off my back is the dubbing. Oh wow, is it awful. Some of these actors are actually pretty talented too, yet they just give off awful performances. While actors like Carly Rae Jepsen and Terrence Scammell were decent, others like Maddie Zeigler, Nat Wolff and especially Elle Jones were not only flat out terrible, but also badly miscast. Elle Jones was great as Alice in the underrated J.J. Abrams' hit ""Super 8"", but here she was so bland and boring that I really believed that she didn't really care about the script. Another thing that I didn't like was Victor. This was a character that added nothing to the story, but only to contribute some really immature jokes which is something that I really hate in animated movies. Something that really bugged me too was the historical inaccuracies. The film shows the Eiffel Tower being partially constructed as well as the Statue of Liberty, which also already turned green, still in France before being shipped across the Atlantic yet in real life the Statue would already be in New York and actually look like copper by the time the Eiffel Tower started construction. However, the thing that I really hated the most about this film was the fact that it had so many pop songs. All they did was just really annoy me and also ruin pivotal moments in the film particularly a scene near the end which I won't spoil. Had they cut those darn things out and replaced them with an instrumental score, I'd probably be kinder to the movie.""Leap!"" is a very unbalanced movie. Though it does have a good story, fantastic animation, and some decent characters, it's also bogged down by terrible characters, bad voice-over work, historical inaccuracies and pointless pop songs. If I were you, if you really wanted to see this movie, I'd recommend finding a copy of the French version and watching it with subtitles. I can guarantee that you'll have a better experience with that version of the film than this."

A troublemaker in young age, then runaway, become a false identity user, a liar and a thief. She stole the letter from her employer and used others recommendation letter to replace her identity. These are the serious crime and people think okay when it's a cartoon to watch? Besides, she is bad mannered, no appreciation to the cleaning lady who taught her dancing skills, she blindly proud of her strength and talent, and she failed the audition. If the movie ends here, I appreciated it's effort to being meaningful that talented people can easily fail because of their ego. But the plot brutally added a chance for her, and the rich girl quite for competition.No idea why this kind of character will success at the end. Too toxic if this is a story tells about dream; if you have a dream, you should try hard to catch it, not wait for others to help you.2 terrible issues in real life 1)teenage runaway, 2)false id use."

But I took my 7-year-old son to see Leap today and I really enjoyed it.The story is light, surely to be appreciated by young girls. My son was restless through the second half, only rejoining the action when the little boy character was on screen.What I enjoyed most was the graphics that were very good. The scenes were great. I lived in Paris for 3 years so anything in that city brings back fond memories. Both the body language and facial expressions of the characters were spot on. I chuckled many times through the movie as I saw how wonderful a job the animators did.I enjoyed the story too. Who wouldn't enjoy a story with a positive outcome. It was certainly unrealistic but still fun."
" functional animation, functional story, functional characters
",0.0,-0.3737,2017-10-19 00:00:00,6,It's late 19th century. Felicie (Elle Fanning) and Victor (Dane DeHaan) are best friends at an orphanage. She dreams of dancing and he helps her escape to Paris. She finds her way to the National Academy of Music and is taken in by crippled caretaker Odette (Carly Rae Jepsen). Cruel Regine runs the ballet school and Camille (Maddie Ziegler) is a snooty aggressive little girl trying to be a ballerina. Felicie steals Camille's invitation to Mérante's class who is picking the new Clara in The Nutcracker. Victor tells her that he's working for Eiffel who is busy building his tower and the Statue of Liberty.The animation is functional. This Canadian-French production is equivalent to Illumination Entertainment level. It's fine but not anything ground breaking. The characters are fine. There are the plucky kids against great odds and villains and other archetypes. The story is also fine but a few changes would have helped. Felicie stealing the letter is probably the main mistake. It puts her on the wrong side and lets Camille off the hook. Camille should be bullying the other girls to force them out. Felicie can still learn from Odette and Mérante can simply invite her into the class after the tavern dance. The plot can arrive at the same place without compromising Felicie. It's also off when she sleeps through her audition putting her at fault once again. The dance off is actually quite exhilarating but the climaxing gets a second unnecessary trip around. A Hollywood studio would make everybody an animal and this would probably sell a lot better. Sing is not much better and it made over $600 million. Non-Hollywood doesn't have the formula yet. They don't know how to market and make a modern family-oriented animated movie.
" Post-Irma fluff better than expected
",0.4404,0.9952,2017-09-22 00:00:00,8,"First, let me make it completely clear that the only reason I went to see ""Leap!"" is that I desperately needed a post-Irma diversion. I had recently gotten back home after booking out for a relative's place ahead of Hurricane Irma, and I needed some light, fluffy nonsense which had nothing to do with wind speeds, power outages or the like.Despite that heavy introduction, I have to say that I got more out of the movie than I expected. Yes, it filled the need for fluffy nonsense. But it also proved to be far more entertaining than I thought it could be, and in the end I'm glad I saw it.That's not to say that ""Leap!"" is not without its faults. The movie is very problematic. Some negatives: 1) The plot is literally fairy-tale simple; some plot points are obvious well ahead of their actual occurrence, although a few seemed forced. 2) Character animation seems jerky and stiff. Perhaps this is because the animators attempt to portray a more realistic dance physicality, implying that their characters actually have internal skeletons. It just seems a bit ""off""; but then maybe I've become too accustomed to the cartoony fluidity of Pixar-style animation. Facial movements in relation to dialogue, especially in the first act, really seem weak. 3) Jarringly out-of-place pop songs. The story takes place in 1880s France; the very modern dance-pop tunes are grating compared to plot-appropriate classics such as Swan Lake; 4) While Felicie and Camille are both pretty, Nora, who is more or less Felicie's best friend at the dance school, has a face which -- I do not want to sound cruel here -- is, let's say, awkward-looking. This bothers me because it's unnecessary. Felicie is redhead. Camille, her antagonist, is blonde. Nora is brunette. One would think that would be enough to distinguish the characters. But the designers inexplicably chose to make Nora ""less pretty than"". 5) A chase scene which leads into the final act is shockingly scary, with a character's viciousness and the threat of child endangerment grossly inappropriate to the film's overall cotton-candy sweetness.Now, as I said, aside from my goal for distraction, I got more out of ""Leap!"" than I expected. I will gladly list some positives: 1) Absolutely stunning visuals. The initial ""fly-over"" sequence of the French countryside is genuinely jaw-dropping. This level of detail is pretty much maintained throughout the film. After years of the rich, colorful vibrancy of Pixar, the soft, near-photo realistic scenery of ""Leap!"" is delightfully refreshing. 2) The story does have a positive ""never give up on your dreams"" message. It's not really brought out until the last third of the film, but the plot does steadily work towards it, and it all fits together well for any children in the audience. 3) Mel Brooks. His characterization for the voice of Luteau is incredibly natural. I had no idea it was him until the closing credits. 4) Lots of great comedy, especially from the male lead, Victor, who also proves to be the primary comic relief (Nora is a secondary comic relief). The best comedy sequence in my opinion happens near the middle of the film, when Victor relates his adventures to Felicie in what I can only describe as a series of panning stills. The relationship between the images and his descriptions provides really enjoyable humor.My only reason for not rating this movie higher is that overly-scary chase. Were it not for that, I could give ""Leap!"" an 8 out of 10."
" Someone Tricked Theaters Into Playing This Straight-to-Netflix Movie

Leap is awkwardly paced, preposterously plotted, poorly voiced and insanely bland. Yet, it's STILL not the worst kids movie of 2017. Because of some tired clichés that work purely based on their reliability, Leap is better than The Emoji Movie, Smurfs: The Lost Village, The Nut Job 2, and Despicable Me 3. Doesn't anyone consider the children?!"
" Good message, but ruined by mind baffling plot choices!
",-0.5411,0.9748,2017-09-03 00:00:00,2,"Overall Leap is a cute film with a good message, reach for your dreams no matter what. I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't, because there were too many things that didn't add up. Most films require some suspension of disbelief, however, in order to enjoy it Leap requires you to suspend all common sense and knowledge of history. This is because there are things shown in the movie that just don't make sense and others that are obviously historically incorrect. Here is a partial list:1) The Statue of Liberty and Eiffel Tower are both shown under construction. However, the Statue of Liberty was unveiled in the USA in 1886, while the Eiffel of Tower wasn't started until 1887. Their construction didn't overlap. Not to mention that the Statue of Liberty is shown as green, when it was actually copper colored when first made and turned green over time. 2) The ballet role that the girls are fighting for is The Nutcracker, but the Nutcracker wasn't performed for the first time until 1892. This is 6 years after the Statue of Liberty was completed and 3 years after the Eiffel Tower was completed. 3) The villain who goes after Félicie says ""It's Hammer time"", an obvious reference to the 1990 M.C. Hammer song.4) The clothing includes jean shorts and leg warmers, obviously not consistent with the time period. 5) Spoiler alert: Félicie gets into the ballet school. There are 8 or so girls at first, and they are told that every day one girl will be dismissed until the remaining girl gets the part in the Nutcracker. So with 8 girls and 1 being cut per day, this is all taking place over the span of a little over a week? So within 1-2 weeks, Félicie becomes a good enough dancer to stay in the auditions, and forms an amazing bond with Odette? This time frame is really just baffling. 6) Spoiler alert: Félicie returns to town and is able to get the part in the Nutcracker the same day of the performance. So this is a major performance and she is given the part the day of the show with no rehearsals? Even if she knows the routine already, she is dancing with another dancer and they would have to rehearse to be doing the turns and jumps at the same time. This just makes no sense.My 7 year-old didn't notice any of these things, but my 11 year-old did. Seriously did no one fact check this movie, or did they assume that it is a kid's movie so it doesn't matter? It's really too bad that they didn't fix these issues, because the movie really does have a good message, and is so close to being likable!"
" Pleasant, inoffensive and unremarkable
",0.5106,0.9991,2017-08-31 00:00:00,6,"With apologies to Shakespeare, to leap or not to leap, that is the question. But before you answer that question, you need to know the type of leaping being proposed. Should you leap forward, leap over, leap up, leap down or leap for joy? Well, no matter what kind of leaping it is, many people will warn you to ""look before you leap"", while others will tell you to ""just take the leap"". Of course, doing the latter requires taking what's called a ""leap of faith"". But since faith, by definition, is a belief for which there is no objective evidence, it sounds like we're back to that ""look before you leap"" advice. I guess we could keep things really simple, as does the Canadian-French animated musical adventure comedy ""Leap!"" (PG, 1:29) or, ""Ballerina"", as this movie was originally titled (and is still called in movie markets outside the U.S.). Either way. This movie is about leaping, both literally and figurately, whether you're a little girl who is an aspiring ballerina or anyone with a dream who is wondering whether or not to take that leap. Félicie (voiced by Elle Fanning) is an 11-year-old girl living in a late 19th century orphanage in the rural area of France known as Brittany. She dreams of being a ballerina, dancing around the orphanage as she does her chores, but a humorless Mother Superior (Kate McKinnon) sternly reminds her ""dreams are not reality"". Félicie's fellow orphan and best friend, Victor (Nat Wolff, who replaced Dane DeHaan for the American version), has dreams too. He wants to be an inventor and has already built himself a set of wings. One night, he uses those wings to get himself and Félicie out of the orphanage. They are pursued on a motorcycle by an orphanage employee named M. Luteau (Mel Brooks), but they get away from him by hopping a train to Paris. Let the dreams be pursued – and let the leaping begin!As soon as Félicie and Victor get to Paris, they become separated when Victor accidentally ends up on a boat floating down the Seine, leaving Félicie to her own devices. She finds the Paris Opera House, sneaks in and catches the Paris Opera Ballet's Prima Ballerina rehearsing and is inspired by the sight. Then Félicie is caught by a security guard, but a cleaning lady named Odette (Carly Rae Jepsen) gets her off the hook. Odette tries to get rid of Félicie, but she has nowhere to go. And there's also that business of her dream and all. Félicie follows Odette to her other cleaning gig, working for a wealthy and mean restaurateur named Régine Le Haut (Kate McKinnon). Félicie convinces Odette to help her clean and, when she finds out that Odette used to be a ballet dancer, Félicie gets Odette to train her. Meanwhile, a fierce rivalry develops between Félicie and Régine's daughter, Camille (Maddie Ziegler), who is also studying to be a ballerina. Félicie then intercepts Camille's invitation to audition for ""The Nutcracker"".But what happened to Victor? Don't worry. He's fine. When he reconnects with Félicie, he tells her about a strange sequence of events which lead him to become friends with the young assistant (Tamir Kapelian) of one Gustave Eiffel, who is in the midst of building an odd-looking metal tower in Paris. Victor gets to help out in Eiffel's workshop and uses that opportunity to work on his inventions. Félicie and Victor meet up a few times and their friendship seems to be progressing towards romance, even as Félicie is being pursued by a young, arrogant Russian ballet dancer (also Tamir Kapelian). Meanwhile, Félicie has been subjected to the tough tutelage of Mérante (Terrence Scammell), the ballet director. And everything is coming to a head for Félicie regarding her relationships with all the other people in her life and her valiant (but dishonest) efforts to realize her dream and perform at the Paris Opera Ballet. ""Leap!"" is a charming, but slight animated fantasy. There's nothing new here, except for the setting – and that's portrayed somewhat inaccurately. Based on the level of completion of the Eiffel Tower, this story takes place in April 1888, but the Statue of Liberty is also shown being constructed, even though it had been sent to the U.S. two years earlier. Of course, this film's target audience won't notice those details, but kids (or parents) might notice that they've seen stories very much like it many times before. Co-directed by Éric Summer and Éric Warin and written by Summer, Carol Noble and Laurent Zeitoun, the movie is a combination of ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Cinderella"", while feeling like an attempt to copy the typical Disney princess movie formula. It lacks the energy and entertainment value (and musical accompaniment) of those films, but it's still a very pleasant way to spend an hour and a half. Most kids (especially, but not only, little girls) will like it, while the adults who bring them will likely appreciate the scenery – and the animation, often looking photorealistic. It's worth taking the leap to see this one. ""B"""

This film teaches it all - honesty, perseverance and the importance of practice, family, believing in yourself, believing in your dreams and passion. Felicie makes a lot of mistakes during her journey, which set her back, but that doesn't stop her from continuing to push through.The story begins when Felicie and her best friend, Victor escape from an orphanage. They take a train to Paris so that Felicie can attend a dance school there and Victor can become an inventor. They arrive in Paris without any money.

It is very detailed and their mouths move with the words they are saying so well the animated characters seem real. The voice acting is spot on. The voices are filled with emotion and an inspiration to the audience, including me. My favorite part is when Felicie watches a ballerina at the French dance school. She takes just one look at the ballerina's dance and knows she wants to dance and that she can dance. You can really see Felicie's passion for dancing right there. The whole movie is all about passion and the movie will inspire viewers to follow their dreams.The message of this film is to follow your dreams. It show how, in order to succeed, you have to work very hard, believe in yourself and have passion. Felicie is an exemplary role model.

I imagined Odette wouldn't sound like that. It's completely unexpected, not in a good way. It lacks passion and charisma of one who used to be the prima, the best ballerina.

It's not like there isn't an audience. How many millions of young girls across the world take ballet classes? ""Leap!"" offers an alternative to recent children's movies like ""Sing"" to cater to all the aspiring dancers and ballerinas among us.""Leap!"" truly captures the magic of Paris at the turn of the century. As far as an animated film can anyways. The scenes of Paris's cobblestone roads and the Eiffel tower under construction are mesmerizing. Although the animation isn't necessarily top-notch for 2016, it is decent enough to be entertaining. ""Leap!"" tells the tale of an orphan from Brittany named Félicie, a fierce and strong spirited redhead who strongly resembles Anastasia from the iconic 1997 flick in both appearance and backstory. Félicie is an orphan who doesn't know her parents or origins. Her only link to her past is a music box with a dancer which sparks a passion for dance that leads her on a journey to Paris where she steals the identity of a cruel aristocrat's daughter named Camille Le Haut to join the Paris Opera Ballet in her place. She is accompanied by an aspiring inventor named Victor who becomes Gustave Eiffel's assistant and almost names the Statue of Liberty, ""The Statue of Puberty"". While the story of ""Leap!"" isn't exactly unique, the best part of the narrative is the girl positive message. Although there is a chosen romantic lead for the main character, this side-story doesn't overshadow the broader story of overcoming adversity and rivalry. The lack of romance in the film makes it more realistic and puts it in stark contrast to Disney's usual offering. Felicie and her rival ultimately compete for the role of Clara in The Nutcracker. Guided by her mentor, the retired dancer Odette, Felicie overcomes her lack of formal training and becomes very talented. At one point, Odette tells Felicie, ""Build on this. Feel your anger and your pain and your sorrow and your joy, and put it all into your dance. Live the music, feel it. Every note, every sound, every harmony needs to have your body vibrating from the end of your hair to the tips of your toes. And then, and only then, will you take her down"". The rivalry between Félicie and Le Haut culminates in a final fight scene that occurs on the top of the Eiffel tower. Overall, adults may find ""Leap!"" enjoyable on its own. But it is definitely made for kids. At least the soundtrack was on point. From classic ballet music to Demi Lovato and modern pop. If you have a daughter, or son for that matter, who has ever shown interest in dancing or ballet. Then your child simply must watch this movie. Another one like it won't come out for a while. That makes it a parental obligation."
" Charming movie about chasing your dreams and never giving up
",0.6667,0.981,2017-05-17 00:00:00,7,"Im a huge fan for animation, I heard about this movie and didn't really know what to expect. What I got was a beautiful movie with the positive messages of chasing your dreams and never giving up on them no matter how hard things may seem.I do kinda wish the subplot of victor could have tied in more with the main focus of Felicie but it is what it is, I ain't complaining.Finally, It was hilarious and very charming too. Perfect for families. Enjoy the movie!"
" Dreaming's easy, but chasing it needs all the effort.
",0.2382,0.9979,2017-05-04 00:00:00,7,"Well, I praise a lot, particularly the European animations for preserving the 2D animation. That does not mean they lack behind in 3D format. The recent film 'The Little Prince' was the perfect example of a quality 3D animation outside Hollywood. Pars with Disney, Pixar standards. Technically, as well as the story contents. But the quantities are very less and also making it a bit expensive. So they usually prefer producing it in the English language for the wider/international market, keeping North America particularly in mind. This is a French English-language film that co-produced by Canada.This is a nice film, that particularly targets little kids and mostly the girl audience to inspire Ballerina. Cute characters and scenes, but very familiar story. Shares lots of similarities with 'August Rush', except the field of interest. I am not an expert or know all about Ballet, but some of the parts involving them were turned me off. I know the gravitation force is irrelevant in animation since they're not real world to comply with science, but maybe I'm being an adult and knowing that stuff might have influenced me to think that way. It reminds me I'm really an adult, though this film should be watched as a kid despite whatever you are. However, nothing affected me from enjoying it.It sets in the 80s of the 19th century France. At the time when Eiffel Tower and Statue of Libery were on the construction, a poor orphan girl named Felicie escapes orphanage with another boy to pursue her dream to be a ballerina. Then they arrive in Paris, and very soon they find their separate ways to achieve the goals. Not all smooth sail, especially for her. So she takes the opportunity that comes her way, even after knowing it was wrong to do.❝You have something that she can only dream of: passion!❞From there, with all the complications tailing her, how far she could go to make her dream come true. Which also includes the amount of dedication put on her undertaking to meet the expectations of her trainer, rivals and many others. And to show the world the interest is not simply based on enthusiasm, but willingness to sacrifice anything for it. Her journey from nothing to the edge of something new to define her life is the film that briefs for just short of 90 minutes.This is not another 'Billy Elliot'. Animations are usually comedy, fantasy and musical, but recently the adventures and science fictions are surging. I don't remember I ever have seen an animated dance flick. Not the classical dance, not in the modern 3D animation format. The closest one was a decade old 'Happy Feet'. So that makes it is a unique product and comes under a must see for all the animation fans. But the storyline is predictable and many sequences were intentionally dragged to be cliché. Because it works, particularly if they're aiming for the younger generation who haven't seen many films in their lives. Only we the grownups whine.Most of the voice-over artists are well known Americans actors which boosted the film. The character combinations are good. It brought the variety, especially slightly to ride off the main theme in a few occasions. Like the boy's interest in inventing things which were other major parts of the twist and turns in the narration. It is not a great animation if it was from Hollywood, but coming from France and the theme it focused on, the effort must be appreciated. Overall a much better film than what the average reviews and ratings around the internet says. It is a ballet film means not those who love it should watch it, but those target audience should not miss it. That means generally worth a watch, but not for everyone.7/10"
" Charming and inspiring
",0.765,0.9993,2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Grade: A-Rating: PG, 89 minutesIn a Nutshell: This gorgeous family-friendly film paints Paris with an incredibly charming stroke, created by the L'Atelier Animation Studio in France. You're easily transported back to 19th Century France.I love titles that have double meanings. While the orphan Felicie's dream was to produce the incredible leap she had seen a ballerina make once, the film also encourages us all to take a leap of faith and hard work to make our dreams come true.Uplifting theme: Passion Dream big and take action. You are unique. Don't let anyone tell you that you're nothing. Persistence, hard work, tenacityThings I liked: Catchy theme song. All of the music was infectiously good and included a lot of lovely songs unfamiliar to Americans, as well as a few faves like ""Suitcase"" by Sia, and ""Confident"" by Demi Lovato. Carly Rae Jepsen voices Odette, and also sings and wrote several of the songs. The scene where Victor tells Felicie about his first day in Paris was hilarious. Excellent animation stops and sequences. Felicie's training sequence was really cute and as inspirational as any sports movie training montage. Elle Fanning voices Felicie, whose dream it is to dance in the Nutcracker Ballet. Elle Fanning actually performed in The Nutcracker 3D (2010 movie). Maddie Ziegler voices Camille. She's a dancer in real life, having appeared on Dance Moms in 2011. Victor was voiced by Dane DeHaan in the international version of the film. Nat Wollf was used in the American release. It's well balanced in comedy, magic, and drama. The ballet battle between Felicie and Camille before the big evening performance was adorable and hilarious. It feels like a European animation, because, it is. Originally, it was entitled ""Ballerina"", which is the version I first saw. It was choreographed by Aurelie Dupont and Jeremie Belingard. The dancing animation in the beginning felt a little off, but by the end it was perfect. The film appears to have a deeper origin. Director and writer Eric Summer also comes from Brittany where the story begins.Things I didn't like: Some of the animation looked rushed and out of sync, particularly in the beginning. The underdog plot isn't unique, but it's still very sweet. Most of the characters are thin archetypes. Some critics don't like the fact that pop music is played, insisting it should all be classical ballet music like Tchaikovsky, but that didn't bother me at all. I actually liked it. Other critics complain that the filmmakers didn't do their research for historical accuracy. For example, were there motorcycles in France in the 1800's as this movie supposes? It turns out that yes, there were in the later half of the 1800's, just about the same time the Statue of Liberty was being built. Funny lines: ""Thank you Mother Superior. And may I just say that you're looking very superior today?"" – Victor ""Who is that?"" Felicie (Elle Fanning) ""Rudy."" – Dora (Elana Dunkelman) ""From the top boys' class, holder of the best cheekbones at the Opera award. I love him. He's so blonde and shiny."" – Nora (Shoshana Sperling) ""How is that pick-up line working for you?"" – Felicie ""I am loving your apron!"" – Victor ""Paris! City of romance. City of Dreams! City of Romance! City of Pigeons!"" – VictorInteresting lines: It's when you're tired you start to progress."" – Odette (Carly Rae Jepsen) ""Tired is for losers."" – Regine (Julie Khaner) ""There's a difference between being ready and being ready to do it well. That's why we train every day."" – OdetteTips for parents: This is an enjoyable film for all ages. It's funny, sweet, and inspiring. Several fart jokes. Your little ballerina daughter will be very inspired and want to see the Nutcracker Ballet. I really like how the movie features two children with dreams, who don't just fantasize about what they want to do, but are willing to work hard to achieve it. No profanity. Some bullying. Some animated moments of peril.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice"
" Adorable, fun and great moral message! A unique gem
",0.8977,0.9994,2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"The idea of a little girl or boy wanting to do ballet is not new. Making an animated film around the passion of Ballet is new as far as I know. I hadn't even seen a single trailer for this but took my daughter to see it. Simply put, it was fantastic. Other reviews mention that it's stereotypical with shallow characters but it IS a children's film and it has such a terrific message behind it. The unique background of France and early 19th Century Paris makes this an adventure that is outside of the normal run of the mill children's film. Yes I suppose it is predictable and as far as characters or moral it's not new but you know sometimes it's nice just to see something nice! Ballerina (now renamed Leap) is not this year's runaway hit but it was a sweet, cute, fun time at the movies.The cast is very good. The characters aren't unique but that doesn't mean they are relatable and fun and easy to connect with. Elle Fanning perfectly voices the hard headed dreamer Felicie. She is a wonderful hero for young girls and boys alike. Her passion for dance is really endearing. Dane DeHaan is adorable and perfect as her best friend (carrying a flame for her) the inventor Victor. The two characters together are perfection and their very light romance adds to the story. Carly Rae Jepsen is fantastic as the former dancer turned mentor Odette, Julie Khaner, Terrence Scammell and Tamir Kapelian round out some of the best of this case. They all fit their roles very well.Perhaps the film is finding some trouble finding it's demographic. I think it might appear to be aimed at older children when in fact I think very young children might enjoy it even more. The backdrop of Paris and the excitement of the ballet and some of the animated dancing scenes are really fantastic. The ""Rocky"" type montage of Felicie honing her dance skills was fantastic. Co-Directors Eric Summer (also wrote the film) and Eric Warin are not full of animated experience so that makes this outing all the more impressive to me. I think someone with more experience in the genre might have really been able to tweak and edit this to perfection BUT that's not to say the Erics did a bad job. I think they did a great job and I will add this to my daughter's film collection the moment it comes out. I enjoyed it very much. 8/10"
" Good family stuff but lacking research
",0.2382,0.5994,2017-04-08 00:00:00,7,"This movie is fun to watch and good family entertainment: could not find any of the typical uncalled for messages that Hollywood insists in cramming in today's CGI based movies.The animations on some dance parts still lack the grace a ballerina has, and in fact you can't see any difference the supposedly heartless character than the soulful one.Also, I'd swear there were still no motorcycles at the time this movie runs, so for me that's a major research flaw."
" Great movie with a major fail!
",0.2244,0.9693,2017-03-24 00:00:00,9,"I saw this just few days ago in a local theater. In brief:The good: + Great visuals + Nice music + Cool storyThe bad: - Teen pop in a music about classical ballet! - Daisy Dukes-like pants in a 1900 France?So generally I enjoyed the movie. It is sort of Cinderella story. My little one did not wanted to see it, so I went alone. However, this is a movie about classical ballet. There are few moments, where they actually are supposed to dance on a classical music background, so in the beginning of the movie there is a scene with the music from Swan Lake, in the middle of the movie there is a ballet school with classical music background and in the end, the final scene is supposed to be showing The Nutcracker, however on this one they play (*drumroll please*) ... CHEESY TEEN POP!!! Yep, that's right - we get ballerinas dancing ballet, supposedly on the music of the Nutcracker, but instead there is some cheesy teen pop! This is the major fail I talk about. Seriously, you cannot ruin a movie in such a bad way normally. No idea what talent you need to come up with such a stupid idea. Instead play the Nutcracker music for a minute until the credits start to flow, then transition to the teen pop. Would be much better, but no - they failed it. Also - in 1900 France they show us a girl wearing leggings and something similar to daisy dukes on top. Hellooooo? Reality check here? There is no such a girl, even in Paris in 1900s which would wear such a thing.But again - in general the movie is fun and amusing, despite the few horrible moments I mentioned. It is also little surreal, as they show some pretty cool flying, but it's a cartoon after all, so I don't mind the daisy dukes so much (but I seriously do mind the music!).Bring your kids, enjoy!"
" Absolutely enjoyable familiar film
",0.4927,0.9845,2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"Good storytelling serving a very classic plot. Predictable? Yes, but no more than Frozen or Tangled. After all, it's a familiar film, not a thriller. The important thing is that the script is able to keep audience's interest all the film long.The 3D work is very remarkable, taking into account the rather limited budget (I've seen movies over 100 Mio failing to achieve that quality by far). Both the Paris environments and the characters deserve the highest score. Particularly, the character design is a bit too much Disney, but nicely done anyway, with beautiful rigging, clothing and hair dynamics. The animation work in the dance scenes is outstanding. Lightning and texturing is absolutely a wow. In a nutshell, L'atelier achieved a little master piece, joining high levels of realism without renouncing to all the expressive resources one can expect in a pure cartoon film. And, what is more important, all that impressive technical deployment is seamlessly put to the service of the storytelling.But, more than that, seeing the face of the attendants to the session, including my daughter, other kids and other parents, leads me to score this film with a 8. After all, audience is king, beyond any other consideration."
" An animated version for kids in which Black Swan meets Karate Kid
",0.0,0.9992,2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"""Ballerina"" is a French/Canadian co-production in the English language that world premiered in October and is now being released in all kinds of countries and here in Germany as well. Americans still have to wait until early March. The co-director and also one of the three writers is Eric Summer, so he was probably the man most in charge of this 1.5-hour film. It is set a long time ago and tells the story of a young girl who dreams of becoming a ballerina. I liked how they referenced the time this film plays by historic context, for example the unfinished Eiffel Tower, the fact that they had motorbikes, but no airplanes or the Statue of Liberty. This was pretty nicely done and also has a bit of an educational purpose. Besides that, the film's strongest side is probably the animation. This is really a beautiful movie for the most part and very nice to look at. This also refers to the female main character and it's impossible not to cheer for her when she tries to live her dream. This is also crucial as, if we are honest, the story is pretty generic and predictable. But that's not a problem if you cheer for the girl throughout the entire movie.Her best friend brings some nice comic relief and also the friend of the bets friend in the second half. It's a sweet little story. The dance instructor (voiced by Joachim Llambi in the German version eurgh...) feels like an animated French version of Dieter Bohlen and the casting show context of the film may not really have helped matters overall, especially as we don't find out about the other contestants. We just see them eliminated one-by one. But these are just minor flaws, just like the fact that the film is sometimes too melodramatic for the sake of it, like the murder attempt at the end, the fire reference about the lady in crutches, the orphanage background, the way she falls several times at the big finale of the competition etc. If you look at the film from a certain perspective, it is actually slightly depressing. But there are also several uplifting moments for sure, some of the pretty memorable and emotional, like when she sees the ballet dancer for the first time. Or when she hugs her instructor at the very end. In general, a film full of hugs. It's a movie that has a lot to do with making the right decisions. Maybe the film suffers a bit too much from character being either completely positive or negative, even if I think with the final (realistic?) change in mind of the other girl they may have made up for it a bit. And I also believe that her instructor somehow deserves her own film with all the vague information we get about her life. Maybe it will be made some day. Who knows.Now back to this one here, there is also a nice song by Sia included in here and this was maybe the best music moment from the film. Fittingly, Maddie Ziegler voices one of the main characters, even if not in the dubbed version I watched. The German voice for the main character by the way comes from Maria Ehrich from the Rubinrot film and sequels. As for this animated film here, there is some good, some not so good, but nothing really great or really bad I must say. Maybe the hug moment between Félicie and the instructor was the best of the best. All in all, it's one of the better animated films of 2016 and I would have been fine with an Oscar nomination, but the film was completely shut out by awards bodies. Then again, maybe it has to wait until next awards season to receive some recognition. If you have daughters who already are interested in ballet and dancing, then this film and the main character will probably win them over completely and keep the idea of becoming a professional dancer in their heads for a long long time."
" Too predictable. Bad casting.
",-0.5423,0.3743,2017-01-18 00:00:00,2,"Unless you're 8 or under this movie was much too predictable. Elle and the boy delivered their lines with conviction. The others just sounded like they were reading. When the plot and the characters are so predictable, the acting with the voices must be over the top to bring it up. This didn't happen in my opinion. I also didn't think the fake-it-till-you-make it message was very positive. It pretty much describes half of Hollywood celebrates but don't subscribe to that notion. You're either good enough on your own merits or you're basically a scam artist faking it. I didn't agree with the need for the orphan to pretend she's someone else. So for that notion, along with the performance of inexperienced cast, I give this movie a 2."
" Familiar but charming, definitely worth a watch
",0.9022,0.9988,2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"Being a lifelong fan of animation and ballet, 'Ballerina' seemed very appealing to me. Plus who doesn't love an underdog/person who wants to succeed at something they love against adversity story.While not up there with my favourite animated films, or one of my favourite films of 2016, 'Ballerina' is nonetheless charming with a lot of delights. It will delight the younger crowd, but fellow ballet fans will also be charmed and there should be enough for adults to find value. 'Ballerina' is much more than a film for ""little girls"" or ""just for kids"" and does a good job telling a type of story that would be relatable to anybody.Coming from somebody who overcame disabilities and bullying and wanted to sing professionally and get training and experience, it took a long time but I got there and have not looked back, 'Ballerina' clicked with me.Of course 'Ballerina' isn't immune to flaws. The story is very familiar and does get predictable, while the characters are very likable but slightly skim-surface archetypes. However, this may seem very nit-picky and can easily be ignored by people and only problems for the toughest of critics.Aside from these, there were also reservations with some of the soundtrack and one voice cast member. The music is often beautiful and infectious, with some genuine enchantment, but could have done with more classical music choices and less pop. A good deal of the pop tunes are very catchy, but more Tchaikovsky would have suited the film better and been more dynamic and a few others grate. Dane DeHaan doesn't sound right as Victor and doesn't fit, sounding too mature for a character clearly intended to be much younger, either he should have tried to sound younger and more boyish or the character should have been voiced by somebody in his late-teens.However, the animation is very good, often excellent, especially in the beautifully studied and meticulous background details and the intricate and graceful choreography that synchronises with the music very well and shows animators that have clearly done their homework. As said, the soundtrack does mostly work, while the script makes a real attempt to appeal to both children and adults (being a family film) and, with a nice mix of humour, pathos and life values and never being over-complicated or childish, it does succeed.The story, even with the familiarity and predictability, goes at a neat pace and as well as having a lot of charm and heart the messaging never comes over as preachy and very much valuable. It is also easy to see why anybody would find it inspiring and easy to relate to, as a young adult both were very easy for me. Even though archetypal, the characters are still likable, the title character has her flaws but it is easy to quickly warm to her. The voice acting, DeHaan aside, is strong, with Elle Fanning and Carly Rae Jensen bringing emotion and spirit to their characters and Maddie Ziegler stealing the show.In summary, a familiar film but a very charming one and one to be seen without prejudice. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
