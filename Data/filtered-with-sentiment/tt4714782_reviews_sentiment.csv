" BORING
",-0.3182,0.3258,2021-04-07 00:00:00,3,"I fell asleep twice while watching it. First the acting is below average, second the plot
doesn't really ""keep you there"", it was never really too interesting. You can't really understand what it is about so nothing really drags your attention. The only thing I liked was the song over the titles at the end."
" Stay as far away as you can from this boring POS movie
",-0.3869,0.3491,2021-03-05 00:00:00,2,"Terrible movie, what horrible acting, even from the first scene.
I hoped this movie would get better by the time I was watching it but it just kept going slowly interesting, only to disappoint you by it going nowhere. In the end this
movie feels like a giant waste of timeI feel like the script is written by a 10 year old, not even joking, at some point the IT boyfriend guy says ""I'm reconfiguring the computer system"", and later some company dude says ""this reflects
badly on business interests"", whoa realistic conversations going on dude!I think it really was getting somewhere when the phone conversations started but then in the end nothing happened with it and we don't even know who it was in the end.This movie is only good if you need something that will make you fall asleep, or maybe it is good for when you're feeling depressed, you should watch part of this and then stop watching it after 20 minutes so you can feel how good life is when you're not watching this movie."
" A lead actress-centered movie.
",0.0,0.0772,2021-02-26 00:00:00,4,"Watch it if you seek enjoyment from her sorrowful, detached and disturbed looks in some fancy and less fancy outfits. Otherwise skip it: there is no real plot in this movie and it is merely a hollow shell of a real story with no actual substance inside. I only watched it for those sad, depressing, but nonetheless delightful closeups of the lead actress.Big question is how can the main character be a smoker, if she has a heart condition. It's inconsistent."
" A spiritual debt and decadence.
",-0.3612,-0.9467,2021-02-12 00:00:00,8,"Maureen is a woman trapped. Living and working in Paris, she is obsessed by a promise she and her twin brother made to each other, that is one of them should die, the other will pass a message from beyond the grave to prove the existence of an afterlife.Working as a personal shopper, Maureen lives on the periphery of ostentatious decadence. Her client is a self absorbed society celebrity living a life of outrageous wealth. Maureen shares nothing in common with her client than a similar body size and an impeccable eye for style.In many ways Maureen, driven by ennui and a loss of spiritual significance, lives vicariously through her client. She seeks some level of meaningful reason to continue knowing that she shares the same heart condition that killed her brother.Events begin to take a darker turn as she engages with a mystery texter, confronting her own darker sense of self she is drawn into a tense stand-off with a seemingly malevolent stalker.The story grows and develops around Maureen's spiritual quest for some sense of closure as she struggles with the grief of losing her brother.This is a minimal piece of film making, the camera is unstable and moving, it's mildly disorientating but beautifully shot. The cool grey lighting of anonymous Parisian streets play with the ordinary moments is suggestive of other layers of significance. Many of the bystanders, shop owners and peripheral characters seem to exist in their own little bubbles which occasionally bump into one and other.Of all the ghost stories I've seen, this perhaps more closely represents what it's like to experience a haunting than any film I've ever seen.Reading some of the negative reviews I can't help wondering why any of these people bother watching anything other than superhero films. This is not a movie for the lazy film watcher, it asks a lot of difficult questions."

",0.0,-0.872,2020-12-01 00:00:00,7,"The protagonist is a waif-like personal shopper for a professional fashionista - Kyra. The personal shopper, Maureen is drawn to Paris after the death of her twin brother, who was a successful bespoke carpenter and medium. Personal shopper Maureen is also a medium and is invited to see whether a house that her brother Lewis had owned is haunted by his or another 'presence'. Having made a pledge with her brother, that the first to die would attempt to contact the other after death, adds an underlying poltergeist sub-text throughout the film; as well as the strange relationship, she has with her employer Kyra, selecting her clothes and predicting her tastes, is made a demanding chore when Maureen rarely sees her, when delivering the clothes. There is an undercurrent of schooling the viewer into understanding the symbolic sub-text of mediumship that runs concurrently throughout the script. Alluding to the spiritualism of the great writer Victor Hugo and his séances where historical antecedents communicated via banging a table, where the mediums had placed their hands, with one bang for yes and two for no, as well as words communicated by banging up to the number twenty-six of the alphabet. And the Swedish painter Hilma af Klint who totally believed her abstract art, that predated Kandinsky and Mondrian was really painted by an unseen hand. Also, the tech-savvy driven plot utilises the mobile phone in a leading role, as the personal shopper, corresponds while on a buying trip to London, to an anonymous texter - and she is vulnerable, for mysterious signs because of her need to make contact with her dead brother. The finale includes a Cartier jewellery purchase, which is used in a frame-up, a murder, a visit to the French constabulary to explain the protagonist's bona fides; and a long-awaited trip to Arabia. But are the poltergeists; either good or evil - coming too?"
" Living la vida ...
",0.0,-0.8654,2020-11-08 00:00:00,7,"Loca or terror? I have to admit the title made me think this woud be a drama! Like just a straight drama about a personal shopper/assistant, whatever you want to call Stewarts character. But it is more than that. It has horror elements in it. It makes sense that it is part of the Home of Horror network of Amazon then (at least in Germany that is).Kristen Stewart plays her character very well and goes to lengths I did not expect (including a nude scene - not in a sexual sense, still displaying her or rather her characters vulnerability). The movie may make sense to you after watching it once or you may think it's madness ... but it is a slow burner and you have to dig that, otherwise you'll be lost! Or the movie will be in your eyes and therefor the time you've spent with it. Especially a big portion of time where she is texting back and forth ... you will either find it eerie or pretentious ... there are no grey areas here. I thought this was well made overall and tells it story more than nicely."
" Overall, a good movie.
",0.4404,0.8318,2020-09-04 00:00:00,7,"This movie, like others that I enjoy until the end, leaves me with more questions than answers. Obviously Kristen Stewart's character is in tune with the spirit world, and (SPOILER ALERT!), we even get a glimpse of her brother towards the end.
So why can't she make contact with him throughout the entire movie?! Even at the end we're left wondering who she's talking to. Most film critics find this appealing for some reason. I find it frustrating.
Anyway, kudos to Kristen Stewart for her acting performance. She is much better in this setting than Twilight. Actually, solid performances all around.
Last point: she leaves Paris to go to someplace in the desert. Her boyfriend, whom she hasn't seen in some time, is supposed to be expecting her after a long flight and five hour drive, but he's not even there to greet her? That was too convenient for the setup to the conclusion of the movie..."
" conversations with the world of the dead
",-0.6486,0.8547,2020-07-03 00:00:00,8,"'Personal Shopper' (Best Director award at Cannes in 2016 tied with Cristian Mungiu's 'Graduation') is the second collaboration between the French director Olivier Assayas and American actress Kristen Stewart after the excellent 'Clouds of Sils Maria' released in 2014. I liked their first film more, but without a doubt 'Personal Shopper' is a very interesting film, one of those movies that can lead to very different and extreme reactions. Some viewers will disregard it from the start for his belonging to the genre of ghost movies that they cannot take seriously. Others will be fascinated by the complexity of the story and the ambiguous and open approach, open to multiple interpretations. The blogs and discussion groups of the thriller and horror enthusiasts are full of passionate debates, analyzes and theories about what viewers saw on screen. Most viewers will find many reasons for satisfaction in a film in which the details require constant attention. It's one of the few movies I'd like to see again right after watching it. But there are also enough disappointed viewers, and those who follow the viewers comments on IMDB will also find several 1 grades. The least numerous are, I think, the viewers who will remain indifferent after watching.How you perceive this film as viewers depends on the extent to which you believe in spiritism and other means of communication with those who have crossed the threshold of death, or at least you are prepared to accept them as a premise for thriller, horror, or ghost movies. The main heroine named Maureen (Kristen Stewart) is a young American whose twin brother, Lewis, died a few months ago due to a heart defect, which she also suffers from and which endangers her at any time. The two siblings had spiritualistic abilities and had promised that in the event of the death of one of them, the departed would send a sign to the survivor. The film tells the story of the waiting for this sign by Maureen, who lives in Paris as a personal shopper, a.k.a. shopping assistant for luxury toilets and jewelry of a star. How will this sign come about? By the classical methods of spiritualism used already by Victor Hugo during his exile on the island of Jersey in the 19th century? Maybe through the beautiful objects (clothes, jewelry) purchased by Maureen for her employer or through art, as the painter Hilma af Klimt, the pioneer of abstract art, did at the beginning of the 20th century? Or, if we are in the 21st century, through iPhone messaging?The story gathers enough complexity for an interesting thriller, including a corpse and situations in which our heroine risks becoming a murder suspect or even a victim. I will not reveal more because almost everything I tell risks being a spoiler, and the film is interesting enough to offer reasons of interest to amateurs of various genres. A second theme of the film is the difficulty of communication, not only with those in the other world but also with those around us. Maureen hardly exchanges a word with her mistress. Communicating with anonymous people on the Internet is an alternative that is proving to be very dangerous. In my opinion, Kristen Stewart's performance is outstanding, a combination of vulnerability and determination, between involvement and the search for communication with the world beyond. The cinematography is also exceptional. Some of the scenes filmed in the abandoned house where the missing brother had lived are illuminated in such a way that the color palette is almost completely reduced to black and white, as a tribute to the classics of the horror genre. The streets of Paris and London bring us back to a reality that should assure us, but which instead only increases our worries. The soundtrack also contributes to this effect. Some scenes include windows, which makes us constantly wonder where they open. Some overly obvious 'ghostly' effects could have been avoided, but overall the film looks great visually. I recommend watching. One more thing. I believe that 'Personal Shopper' is a movie whose status has good chances to grow over time. Some of the viewers risk being already absorbed in the fan discussion forums about the significance of what they have seen on the screen."

This is one more confirmation that Stewart is not a good actress, she has one face the whole movie, is so boring to watch. Many things don't make sense. I can't put it in a genre cause is it a ghost story? drama? A thriller? It had potential to be honest but it's just not worth it."
" Brilliant Performance
",0.5859,0.0258,2020-06-19 00:00:00,7,Career defining performance from Kristen Stewart. Too bad the film lacked substance. The movie over compensated on it's goal to appear sophisticated.

" Well, how's within that, that the soul, continues to exist, after death?
",-0.4215,0.8481,2020-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Personal Shopper is written and directed by Olivier Assayas. It stars Kristen Stewart, Lars Eidinger, Sigrid Bouaziz, Anders Danielsen Lie, Ty Olwin and Hammou Graïa. Cinematography is by Yorick Le Saux.A personal shopper in Paris refuses to leave the city until she makes contact with her twin brother who previously died there. Her life becomes more complicated when a mysterious person starts to contact her via text messages.Personal Shopper is a film that's impossible to recommend with any confidence, even if I personally liked it well enough. It was booed on first showing at Cannes, yet upon the second main screen viewing of it, it got a five minute standing ovation. If you look at the reviews on sites such as IMDb you will see plenty of 1/10 reviews mixed with high scoring ones, evidence of the divisive nature of Assayas' picture. A lot of people went into it expecting a ""Paranormal Activity"" type of film, but it's far from that.It's a meditation on grief and the complexities of the mind and the human condition under duress. Stewart gives her all for the director, a real bravura performance. Yes, the ending is either going to make or break your faith in what you have just witnessed, but if you buy into, and think about the narrative's trajectory, this has haunting and ethereal rewards. 7/10"

" Complete waste of your time
",-0.4215,0.2509,2020-04-29 00:00:00,3,"Fantasy movie wich is totally pointless, tedious and annoying. You're gonna waste your time watching a neurotic chick with greasy hair texting on her phone with God knows who. A movie about spirits ? Really ? Are you kidding me ? Do yourself a favor and go find a better movie."
" Was there even a script? SPOILERS
",0.0,-0.9987,2020-03-28 00:00:00,2,"I'll leave it to all the other reviewers to explain the tedium, frustration and bewilderment this film presents to the viewer.
In summary I'd say it's a beautiful, competently directed film.with a good performance from Kristen Stewart, but which ultimately has NOTHING to say and.says its nothing in the least interesting way imaginable.Instead of an overall review, let me instead clear up a couple of things that lots of other reviewers seem to be missing.Firstly, the sequence where Kristen's character starts receiving anonymous text messages.
There is only one character this could be if you've been paying attention - the man she meets in her boss's apartment, who claims that the affair he's having with her boss is ending due to her husband's intervention.
This is a throwaway piece of dialogue but vitally important as it provides some (vague) motive for what comes later.How Kristen's character does not immediately figure out that he's the one texting her is incredibly frustrating. It could only be him based on hints he drops in the texts, yet she remains oblivious for the entire rest of the film.Later, after many many more texts and lots of train rides and odd jobs, the boss is found murdered.
Interestingly, Kristen's character finds the body, and some of her earlier actions could possibly implicate her, leading us to think that perhaps she's about to be framed?In the next scene - after being grilled by the police but ultimately released without consequence -she receives another 'anonymous' text demanding to know if she has shown their conversation to the police. Why would he be concerned about that? Well duh. Because HE'S THE KILLER.
She still hasn't cottoned on.The next scene.is where it gets interesting. In a series of texts we see that he's making his way to her apartment. He's in a cab. He's outside. He's coming up. He's right outside the door!
This scene.is tense. But instead of a confrontation, he slips a note under the door asking her to meet him.in a hotel.
For some reason she does this. She still hasn't put two and two together. She doesn't even seem.to be aware of any danger. Her boss has been killed, the mystery texter sounds guilty and that texter is possibly trying to frame her for the murder, or perhaps murder he as well.
She is oblivious.In the hotel she enters the room. She waits for a.moment as the tension builds and then the door opens. She turns around to finally meet her mystery texter aaaaand ... the camera fades out.
Instead of witnessing the revelation and confrontation to which the whole film's seemingly been building, we instead get a shot of elevator doors opening and closing in the hallway as some kind of ghostly presence walks around.
What the fuuu...!? This is such an incredibly weird directorial decision. Why would you cut away at literally the only part of the film.that has any stakes??Anyway we then watch the mystery texter walk out of that same hotel room and - SURPRISE! - it's revealed to be the guy we already knew it was.We are thinking. What the hell happened in that hotel room? Could he have killed Kristen's character? When will we see what took place there?He walks out through the lobby only to be apprehended by random police who show up out of nowhere... then he escapes. This is, as we're about to find out, totally irrelevant.Cut to the next scene. Kristen's character is fine and well and meeting a friend for a drink. She vaguely mentions that they caught the killer and that she's been cleared of all suspicion by the police. The conversation then moves on.The murder and the texting is never mentioned again. What happened in the hotel room.is never addressed.We get zero payoff for her relationship with the texter. The killer's motives are.never revealed and there are.no consequences for any of it. The whole thing was POINTLESS.The fact that many reviewers didn't figure out who she.was texting or who killed her boss shows that even the plot that was there was incredibly.poorly handled.This is why this film.has so many 1 star reviews. It is such a vacuous and empty experience because the foundations of a good film are simply missing. There is no plot resolution, there is no character development and there is no point to any of it.I haven't even touched on the supernatural elements because there isn't even a basic plot there to get angry about, it's just a random sequence of events with.no conclusion at the end.The tragedy is that this film.could have been great if it only had a functioning script. As it is, I simply cannot recommend this to anyone. What a waste."
" Dull arthouse wannabe
",-0.4019,-0.7481,2020-03-23 00:00:00,3,"PERSONAL SHOPPER is a would-be French horror flick that plays out as more of an arthouse drama for the most part. It's the LOST IN TRANSLATION of horror films, as the camera follows the generally uninteresting Kristen Stewart (complete with gratuitous nude shots) as she grieves for the loss of a sibling, helps a medium with her work, and becomes convinced that she herself is being haunted. It's slow and boring throughout, with a trite script and dullish characters that'll have you reaching for the off switch. I previously enjoyed the director's miniseries CARLOS THE JACKAL, but this is a big step down from that."
" LOW BUDGET FILM, GOOD ACTING BUT WEAK STORY
",-0.5346,-0.9313,2020-03-14 00:00:00,5,"I don't have anything against low budget films as long as they actually have an interesting story to tell. I didn't quite get the point of the movie. Basically the main character was trying to make contact with her deceased brother. There were many irrelevant things going on in the movie and, as others have said, they didn't add to the plot at all. There were many train rides, lots of texting (which I could barely read since they were so small - but in the end they didn't add anything at all), some subtitles since the movie took place in France, which again, took a lot of work to read.
Lots of time was wasted watching Kristin Stewart try on someone elses clothes and again the whole texting with a stranger was a complete waste of time.
I think the acting was decent, but you can only do so much without a story.
I could think of many other ways to develop this story...it really had potential, but nothing ever came to fruition. The ending was vague and dissatisfying."
" Lonely Fashionista
",-0.3612,0.9776,2020-03-04 00:00:00,6,"This film has one of those twists which has obviously created some maddeningly open interpretations from what I have read and seen. Which once upon a time used to be problematic for me, given the messy and self serving panoramas of directors like David Lynch in particular but with their constant influx in the movies over the years, I've come to accept that all of our entertainments can't be expected to to be neatly wrapped up with a ribbon at their conclusion. Some films require participation and that should be seen as a gratification.Nevertheless, this one had it's own merits aside which drew me in and sold the film as a whole. It's an enthralling character study and an entirely watchable film and to be honest, Kristen Thomas used to be problematic for me also, but here she proved my prejudices wrong and is wonderful to watch, holding this movie and the many complex scenes on her own.Some great spooky moments and vibes as well. Sometimes it's good to be left guessing."
" Falls flat as a film ... not enough support for Stewart
",-0.3089,-0.6716,2020-02-07 00:00:00,6,"Olivier Assayas' 'Personal Shopper' shows the importance of support roles and basic technique for quality control in films. Shoddy direction and third-rate acting for the most part. I know the idea of shaky 'hand-held' shots is all in-vogue, hyper-realism, spontaneity etc., but the director also needs to keep the action moving and remind actors to show up. What should have been a thriller ended up flat and farcical for me, like we were meant to believe it all? And no fault of Kristen Stewart who was superb in the role of grieving sister troubled and unable to move on in her life. When text messages are more exciting than people characters you know you're in trouble ... the ghost scenes redeem the film slightly but 'Personal Shopper' was mostly a wasted opportunity."
" Don't tell
",0.0,-0.9558,2020-01-11 00:00:00,9,"I've never seen a movie which treats the viewer with as much respect as this one. There is no exposition, no hints to make sure you can keep track of what's going on. Every conversation is written for the characters, not for the viewer. And the scenes of nudity - they are neither drawn out or overplayed, nor is the movie coy about them. Everything just is. It's truly extraordinary.Furthermore, the main character is extremely likeable. She's smart, direct, honest, open, and well-acted. With this directing style and that kind of protagonist, I would probably give it a positive score even if the story was completely boring. Which is not the case at all - the story, just like the rest of the movie, is unconcerned with tropes. Highly unpredictable, highly authentic.As you can tell, I appreciate this style of directing a lot. More movies should be like this. It might even be a 9 - I've given it an 8 because the watching experience wasn't mind blowing, but it feels like the kind of thing that I will probably appreciate more over time. The plot is definitely worth thinking about.Edit: I am changing it to a 9/10, and I think I figured out what the plot is about.At first glance, it is merely a mystery.At second glance, you might guess that Maureen died at the scene in the hotel. Ingo, who was probably also the one who texted her, has killed both her and Kyra. In the scenes where doors are opening and closing by themselves, it is really her ghost walking out.But this is a bad theory. Why is it bad? Because a theory should explain the strange things that happen, and this theory explains almost nothing. Yes, it fits the doors opening and closing. But that is the only thing it explains. It doesn't explain who texted her (they knew things about her that Ingo wouldn't know). It doesn't tie into the specter she encounters in her brother's house. And it doesn't explain the ending at all. Worse still, the one data point which fits well is contradicted in the next scene. She is clearly visible to other people. Yes, perhaps her soul is still here for a while. But then, why would she be invisible in the first place? No matter how you look at it, it doesn't explain the movie well. If this theory was correct, then the plot would be poorly constructed.Here is what I think really happened. Maureen is distraught about her brother's loss. A part of her can't let go. Because she is a medium, that part has taken on a form of its own. The specter is her. The person messaging her, it's her. The doors opening and closing - it is her, but it is the separate part of her that has been separate all along. Maureen didn't die. She's still alive at the end of the movie. The ghost she encounters then; it's her again.This theory explains almost everything. It explains why the messenger knew her as well as they did. It explains why it started right after the specter appeared. It explains why it wanted her to do forbidden things. It explains the doors opening and closing on their own, despite Maureen being visible in the next scene. And it explains the ending.Also, notice that the hotel room was booked under her own name. With this theory, this is literally accurate.It's not obvious what happened with Ingo. Maybe she made him kill her. But more likely he acted by himself, and then the specter decided to steal the jewelry.But despite this one loose end, it is the far better explanation. Most of what happens fits into it, the key moments of the movie obtain meaning, and the beginning and ending ties it all together. Her brother's spirit is still there; we see him at some point. He has emotional importance for her. But the one whom she encounters at the beginning, at the second scene in the house, during the text messages, in the hotel, and at the end - it is all the specter, who is a part of herself."

" One of those times when a completed script would have helped
",0.0,-0.9579,2019-11-22 00:00:00,5,"This movie almost had me. It was interesting up to a point, and then it just began to fall apart.Personal Shopper was apparently quickly pulled together after the collapse of another production, and it ends up feeling like it. There are unresolved and unexplored bits from at least three different movies here. It's not a complete mess. There's a strong enough character line passing through all three to make something resembling cohesive, but it's not strong enough to actually engage.Maureen is a young American living in Paris, but she's obviously unhappy and still refuses to leave. She has a boyfriend in the UAE who tells her to come along, but she must wait in Paris. It's unclear for a while, but we get an exposition dump about a third of the way through the movie where she reveals that she and her deceased brother were both mediums. He died, and she's waiting for a sign from him. In the meantime, she's the personal shopper for a famous, entitled woman. She buys her clothes and accessories, walking into high end boutiques to buy things she could never afford nor wear.Then she starts receiving text messages from an unknown caller on a trip to London that delves into her desire to be the woman she's shopping for. The conversation itself is actually fairly tense for a surprising amount of time, but it quickly feels removed from everything else around the subplot. And that's where the movie really began to fall apart for me.That was where the seams between the three main stories (ghost story, slice of life shopper, and text messages) became really hard to ignore. I kept waiting for it all to come together, but when the starlet is murdered, the movie kind of drops everything only to revisit the ghost story in the final moments of the movie. It's there that we learn that the movie is supposed to be about grief and letting things go, but if that's the case what was everything about Maureen putting on the starlet's clothes that took up the central third of the film?There are ideas running through the movie, and it feels like the person behind the camera knows, in general, what they need to do to make a movie. And yet, the script feels beyond rushed, really rough, and disconnected."
" Don't waste time

" Does This Woman Ever Smile?
",0.3612,0.9857,2019-11-18 00:00:00,5,"I always admire directors who try to do something different with the supernatural/ghost genre. Even when it doesn't come off, as with Personal Shopper written and directed by Frenchman Olivier Assayas. It's definitely not your special effects, accompanied by spine-tingling soundtrack, driven extravaganza and for that we must be thankful. Unfortunately though in fashioning a different sort of generic piece, he's gone completely in the opposite direction, saddling himself with a really weak narrative line, in which he just doesn't seem to know on which aspects to concentrate and where he seems to revel in generating ambiguity at any opportunity.This frustrating inexactness is best seen with the all-consuming convergence on Maureen, the title character played by Kristen Stewart. To my way of thinking, Maureen is the last person in the world you'd ever expect to see as the personal shopper for an internationally renowned supermodel. For starters she admits in the movie she hates the job. Why would a supermodel pick a pretty slovenly dressed, unenthusiastic, introvert of a woman to be her personal shopper? It just beggars belief. I admit amazement to the fact that many critics around the world have praised Stewert's one note performance. She wears the same hang dog facial expression most of the movie, looks continually sullenly downwards and mumbles her lines, that is, when she's not spending much of her onscreen time, looking at her phone and eternally texting. Yes, she's unhappy because she's lost her twin brother from a congenital heart problem from which she also suffers, But shouldn't we see some other expressions besides a permanent air of sulkiness prevailing upon this (as we also discover) part-time self-described medium. And I can't remember seeing a movie's central character so quickly and eagerly embrace the advances of a telephone stalker.I can only agree with those who complain about the conclusion, but also add that I'm not surprised after the waywardness of the first and second acts. To my way of thinking, it's Assayas having an each way bet again. I will say this. Maureen isn't dead as a number of reviewers on these pages have postulated. She very clearly. has at the very least, 3 conversations with support characters, after she's envisaged as passing over. But I can see viewers demanding some sort of rational explanation and therefore clutching at straws. I can also understand why this film was given an elongated booing at it's initial Cannes screening.With better direction, a better storyline and a more nuanced and lively central performance, Personal Shopper may have really stood out against the competition vying for viewing attention."

" O, brother, wherefore art thou?
",0.0,0.5944,2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Having missed all of the ""Twilight"" movies (after trying to start one, then abandoning it as...silly), I only know Kristen Stewart through her other work, ""On the Road,"" ""Clouds of Sils Maria,"" and ""Into the Wild,"" specifically. Her pale beauty which she casually underplays and her ""method"" of acting remind me of what James Dean tried to do with his work. Shunning the glamour of stardom, she invites us into the character rather and tells us how to feel. I'm a fan.""Personal Shopper"" puts her almost exclusively on the screen, so she's carrying quite a load both in screen time as well as demonstrating a person who functions but is also lost in grief over the death of her twin, felled by a heart condition which she also carries. As well, she's a paranormal and has made a pact with her brother that whoever dies first will try to contact the other...for reasons that are never really explained. (One would assume as a paranormal she isn't looking for proof of an afterlife, but that is one of the mysteries the film addresses.)As the title suggests, she is a personal shopper for a celebrity (whose fame is also unnamed) and her boss isn't the most reliable of employers, testing whether or not the job is worth the effort and while not resentful of the person's celebrity, she's also not particularly enamoured of it. If you've ever worked for someone like this, it's one of the dawning realizations: fame is something that happens to people as flawed and annoying as anyone.Her boss is also temperamental and has certain demands that seem at odds with Maureen (Stewart's character) and her effort to contact her brother. And her aggravation seems valid. But Maureen is also under some self-imposed pressure to wind up waiting for her brother's sign from the afterlife. Other spiritualist who are supporting her need to move on to something the produces concrete results. Maureen's sensitivity HAS stirred up some kind of presence, but she's certain it isn't her brother and she's also not comfortable that's it's hanging around her since it might have a wish to harm her... or not.But we watch her personality change, and most of that is focused and directed toward her employer and the Chanel fashions and Cartier jewelry she's shopping for.When an unexplained crisis occurs and Maureen is the likely suspect, she's alarmed that she can't explain either her whereabouts at the time or where some expensive jewelry has gone. As the audience we hold information that Maureen doesn't which takes away from who-did-what-and-when. It's a device that Olivier Assayas uses that puts us at ease, until the final sequence of the film (filmed in sunny Oman which is a world apart from the grey skies of Paris) where the rug gets pulled out from under us and we're left to solve the mystery for ourselves.It's a traditional as well as a new form of ""ghost story"" that imposes the usual horror film devices (see ""Poltergeist"") onto contemporary life and its routine (Maureen's cellphone gets quite a work out). It's a curious film since it likely won't satisfy fans of the horror genre, and people who love Assayas (and the House of Chanel) will most likely be irritated by all the paranormal happenings.Still, the charm of Stewart, the veneer of the world she inhabits as a personal shopper, and the talent Assayas brings to the project make this worth a visit from the art house crowd."

" Personal Fear
",-0.4939,-0.965,2019-07-16 00:00:00,9,"«Lewis, is it you?»Personal Shopper is a different kind of ghost story: one where what may creep the audience isn't the ghost himself - at least it shouldn't -, but other themes that surround the narrative, such as mortality and all the grief associated with losing someone we deeply love. Spirituality also plays an important role, as our main character is a self-proclaimed medium (besides of being, of course, also a personal shopper for a famous woman, hence the title). Ambitious as it is, the movie deals with fear and anxiety in almost paradoxical terms: sometimes mysterious, others even illogical, it goes from art and discovery to paranoia, from fashion and futility to depression and ends up being a little too much flawed, even if, with all the tension and twists, we don't want to believe it, a bit like Kristen Stewart's character. Oh, and is she great... Such an unrestrained performance, leading the movie all the way with courage and a tremendous effort of emotion depth. I don't actually recommend the brilliant ending scene for those who suffer from pathological/chronic anxiety, as I saw myself having a ""mini"" panic attack.

Or perhaps she has to be seen to be frustrated by her job and the constraints placed on her (e.g. not being allowed to try on the clothes).But it feels to me that this would have been a much much better film if the ""waiting"" had been compressed and had occupied her 100% of the time."

This is not just an art film, although it has a lot of art in it and is very artfully done. What this movie is, is a slow character study that Kristen Stewart really delivers on. This movie isn't even about the pain of loss as much as it is about the way it can affect you when you don't know what to do next. Maureen, the main character, is trying to deal with the loss of her brother, as well as her own mortality, as well as her connection to the spirit world, as well as her job that she gets no joy from, as well as creepy stalker texts, as well a traumatic event, and we're watching her try to keep it all together, and she barely does in a completely believable way.

I generally like Assayas's style, and the film proceeds with a realistic feel, but in consequence it also makes little sense, working neither as horror nor as a convincing portrait of a young woman losing her mind.

Yes, she looks cute in a helmet and bomber. Yes, despite having the measliest script ever to work with, her sparse performance managed to almost hold my interest but... I'm genuinely baffled as to how this got such positive reviews and accolades.40% of the movie is watching Kristen Stewart text message a ghost. I repeat: 40% of the movie is a close up of an iPhone text conversation. This, dear readers, is what we call extremely unimaginative screenwriting. KStew's character Maureen (lol) describes herself as ""waiting"" more than once, which is what the other 50% of the movie is. Shots of her waiting to hear from her dead brother. The last 10% or so of the movie is watching her play dress up, or manage her outfits. It's like K.Stew's costumer had free reign over the script; there's a dozen or so of shots of her taking things on and off to make sure she has the cutest outfit for the key shot in each scene and to ensure for continuity, but nothing amounts to anything interesting.There's so.much.time in the movie devoted to watching someone wait/watching someone text/watching someone change clothes that there's no time for character building, exposition or even setting what time of day or location things are happening in. It's like this director skipped film-making 101 and forgot that he's supposed to orient his viewers into an actual reality/timeline, and use secondary characters and sub plots to bolster the main character. This utter lack of substance and exclusive focus on mood makes it feel like a student film, or a really long Dior ad. Honestly, if this was a short it would have probably been awesome, but it just doesn't hold up to actual cinematic scrutiny because the story has no focus. After all, there's nothing cinematic about watching someone watch a youtube video for 5 minutes.Also, someone get the poor girl some dry shampoo and a glass of water."

It's like having a stomach ache--after it passes you wonder what made you eat that food? An androgynous he/she addicted to depression and nicotine who exhibits bad hygiene and thrift shop mannish clothing is supposed to be a personal shopper for a famous celeb who depends on her fabulous abilities and taste. It amazes me how someone so unkempt and NOT into fashion could/would be chosen to do this for anyone? All the characters are bored and boring to watch. Two dogs in the film were the highlights. What was said by Dorothy Parker about Kate Hepburn years ago is true of this actor in the lead: She/he ""runs the gamut of emotions from A to B."" This film is like watching a lobotomized person try to get some emotion going--it farts and burps but never arrives.

" Good foreign film
",0.4404,0.7788,2019-03-10 00:00:00,8,"I just watched this recently and actually liked it very much. It's not a 10 in my book, but I enjoyed it. However, I am not surprised by all of the bad reviews here. I'm guessing that a lot of people assumed because the dialogue was in English and that the lead actress was American that this was an American-made film. Also the film's title belies the story and subject matter. Judging from the comments in the negative reviews, it sounds like the reviewers are unaccustomed to watching films that are not contrived and processed through the American film machine.What I liked about the film was that it did not follow a direct path to its ending. It kept me guessing about where it was going and there were things that were hard to follow. I also liked the fact that I actually had to use my brain during the film to get pieces of the story and to understand what had gone on with the characters previously, how they were related, etc. (no annoying flashbacks or lengthy spurts of expository dialogue to set the scene). I liked not knowing where things were headed and not knowing what would come next. The ending I'll admit was unsettling but I did not mind that. I did not ruin the film for me. What I did find a bit annoying was the sequence of conversing by text message, although it did help to expose the lead character's weaknesses.A lot of people here call the film pretentious but they fail to give the reasons for this label. And reading their comments makes me wonder if they are themselves being a bit pretentious (trying to sound like a seasoned film critic). To these people I say ""watch more foreign films, even if you have to read the subtitles""."
" A pretty good modern ghost story
",0.5859,0.7671,2019-03-02 00:00:00,7,"I don't know much about ghost stories, but I have been gravitating to them of late. This one is the most realistic one I have run into so far. A woman's twin-brother has passed away and she is preoccupied with an oath they had made, whoever dies first will try to pierce the divide and leave a sign for the other. There is a rather sadistic soundtrack consisting of a free-floating sonar-like program but instead of underwater, we get a generalized array of ambient tracks from whatever locale our POV character happens to be at the time and at an extremely high decibel level. If the idea is to keep the viewer a little on edge, it succeeds. There is an extraordinarily realistic visitation scene which frightens. There is a sequence where an unknown texter is harassing the survivor, which under the circumstances, is more than a little eerie.The denouement is predictably unclear except perhaps for especially perceptive viewers of which I do not belong. But an explanation is there that seems quite convincing (I had to read it from a review) which I give the movie credit for. It's not just a scary story that leads nowhere."

Then this is your movie.This is the world as it would be if everything were a text message. We often have to project onto these inadequate, cryptic little communications the emotions and thoughts we would ""like"" to be there but that maybe aren't. The main character lives in a world that is similarly impoverished by incomplete contexts and information, which also means incomplete life in terms of experience. She has a boyfriend via Skype. Her boss interacts with her through short commands. She buys her boss's desires, not her own. Even when the boss is murdered we barely learn about it. And when the murderer meets the main character almost no details are forthcoming. When she dares to live via the things she has bought for her boss, she is not living her own life.Seemingly in reaction to this impoverished reality, the main character fancies herself to be a medium in touch with numinous communications from the world of the dead. She begins to think the ghost of her brother is stalking her via text message. Or is it just some banal pervert who happens to have her number? The scenario is so impoverished because of the cryptic texted information that it's impossible to know. At the end of the movie, we really don't know, and that's the point. In an impoverished world, we are always projecting our own wishes and ""ghosts"" into it to give it at least some hint of meaning. Is that futile? Is it the real realm of ghosts?

Those 2 genres dont blend at all. And this has gotten a Cannes award for directing? What were they thinking?The start was promising, even spooky. But then those laughable special effects ghosts appeared. It ended there for me. Great buildup the first 15 minutes, then those laughable lousy special effects ghosts and then nothing happened afterwards. Just more of the same: more shopping scenes, more scenes about Kristen Stewart looking at abstract art and a few more( totally not convincing) French ghost appearances.It isnt a real thriller.

It seems like the creator couldn't decide whether or not to do a supernatural film, a drama, or a stalking film about someone with a glamorous job. The result ends up a mish mash of all 3 without any of the potential intrigue or suspense. Kristin Stewart is a personal shopper for some famous lady in Paris, and she just wants to make her rent... ok except she doesn't seem the glamorous type for this role here. But ok. There's got to be done reason for her daily routine. She's also got some personal issues about who she wants to be, what she wants to do, and she's wrestling with some personal grief about losing her brother. Ok, drama storyline here. Aaaaand she also happens to be a medium.... walks into a house and someone asks if she can ""feel a presence."" What? Talking about shopping at Cartier and getting in touch with the spirit world in the same movie just didn't work for me. Plus she gets phone stalked and we spend half the movie just having to read her iPhone texts. I can read my own iPhone texts if I want to hear the typing and swoop sounds. Anyway, all this wouldn't be so bad if it was at all interesting and coherent, but it's boring and nothing ever gets resolved. So, I don't get this one."

There are long stretches where we just see Kristen Stewart floating around, dressed or undressed, staring off into space, riding a scooter, riding on a train, trying on clothes, taking off clothes, etc., etc. I'm still not sure what the point of the movie is.

" A story about loss
",-0.3182,-0.9979,2018-09-05 00:00:00,9,"If you want to see an American haunted house-flick with a couple good scares, this is not for you. The film has more layers than that and it does require for the viewer to have individual thought. I would categorize it as a character-driven drama. Maureen (Kirsten Stewart) has just lost her twin brother. Both of them were mediums and before he died, they made a pact: whoever died first would give the other a sign afterwards. We meet her when she is working as a personal shopper for a celebrity in Paris, disjointed from the people around her and consumed by the thought of his brother contacting her from the afterlife.The film moves at a slower pace and is not afraid of normalizing nudity, which is to be expected from a European film. It introduces thoughts about the afterlife and the history of practicing the paranormal. The performances are solid, but Stewart is the one who carries the film from beginning to end.The plot is as follows: Maureen believes that her brother's old house is haunted, thinks it's her brother and tries to reach for him there. Instead, she reaches a bad spirit. Around the same time, she confides about her loss and being a medium to her boss's lover. She starts to receive text messages from someone who is stalking her, and she believes that they are either from her brother or someone manipulating her to believe that they are from his brother. Her boss is murdered and someone tries to pin it on her. It's revealed that the murderer was her boss's lover, and that he's most likely also been sending her the text messages. The bad spirit was just an old spirit that Maureen contacted at the house by accident, because she is a medium, after all.At the end of the film, Maureen starts to have visions that she (once again) believes are from her brother. She sits in a room and asks the spirit questions, and it answers by a loud banging sound. The gist of her last question is: Has all of this been just inside my head, all along? The ""spirit"" answers yes.What I took away from the film was that it was, all along, an amalgamation of her grief that she had no way of comprehending, and her guilt for having the same condition but yet surviving her brother. She was so consumed by looking for her brother in everything she experienced that in the end, she imagined signs from him, and was taken advantage of her obsession and vulnerability by a man who wanted revenge from a lover who saw him as something to be discarded without thought. The film had spooky elements to it, but by the end I was no longer scared, but only sad for her. The only thing she was still holding onto was the certainty that she would have one final contact with her brother. But in the end, she was just alone, and had been alone all along. The film ends with her realizing this fact.I also liked the fact that the film made something seem like a paranormal plotline and then gave it an answer in reality. First I thought that the bad spirit from the haunted house was somehow connected, that a paranormal spirit was giving Maureen signs and followed Maureen and murdered her boss. The scene where Maureen finds her boss's dead body becomes scarier when we learn who murdered her in reality. When Maureen heard sounds coming from the apartment, she didn't hear a disembodied spirit. She heard a human being who'd just committed a brutal murder, and who was in the same apartment with her. And that I find scarier than haunted houses."

The plot is a little interesting and suspenseful, but very low key like the pace. There is really nothing surprising or stimulating about it, other than a single very brief scene. Brief nudity and non-explicit sexual content isn't even very interesting or relevant, but rather more of a gratuitous distraction. The acting was as blah as the plot.

Then I thought why she has a day job and not that happy about it. Then I fell asleep not caring that much about this movie. Part of this is Stewart's low energy acting and the docu-style of the filmmaking. My second attempt went much better. I finally figured out the opening scenes. It does turn into Ghostbusters and Hollow Man. I'd rather have the ghost story take front and center. I don't care that much about her job or her boss. Overall, I feel like Stewart acts most of time.

The constant changes in plot are quite bewildering. At the start Maureen is questing if there are spirits or if its just in our minds. One minute she's attempting to be a medium and unsure if she herself even believes in it to running around as a personal shopper. Then she gets anonymous text messages and the film progress to shots of her sending and receiving messages on her phone. Next thing you know someone has been murdered..... I think they threw that it to try and make it more interesting. Then we end up with a strange scene where she is apparently talking to a ghost who responds by knocking on the walls and finally we are left with the question that the movie began with... Is there such a thing or is it all in our minds. So all in all this movie is a complete waste of time.After reading some reviews on here about how people interpret this movie, particularly the ending, the truth is that by the end I couldn't care less.

The reality of the confusion is more terrible than the ghost; this may be the real foothold of the film. Spirit medium fall into the scams of the earthliness, neither satisfying the material life of reality, nor be sure that they can be redeemed in the supernatural world.
Every time the protagonist approaches the truth, she is at a loss. From this perspective, her waiting, escaping, or anxiety is actually a kind of self-deception and perfunctory."

" Quietly mesmerizing
",0.0,-0.9104,2018-05-13 00:00:00,10,"""Personal Shopper"" is a miraculous film that in its quiet way wreaks havoc with the viewer's perception. You can never be too sure of what exactly is going on, and more than one viewing is mandatory. If you look away you miss important plot points. A reflective mood is essential for taking in what the movie shows us.Kristen Stewart is a surviving twin in this story; at the beginning of the film we hear that her brother has died from the congenital heart ailment they both suffer from. In her upper-20's, she's now alone and grieving in Paris; her boyfriend works in IT and is off in Dubai setting up a mega-company's security protocols for an unspecified timeframe. She works as a personal assistant/shopper for a celebrity of some kind; we hear her say she's not happy with the job or her employer, but it's apparently all she could find. Even then, she has to hound her employer to get the money owed to her, and the employer treats her like she's barely visible. With her entire life on such queasy ground, Stewart is also trying to contact her late brother's spirit. It seems they both had psychic powers and functioned as mediums. They had a pact to try and contact each other, if one of them were to die. She's staying overnight at her brother's house in a rural area outside of Paris, attempting to communicate with him. She comes into contact with an entity in the house, which attacks her with malevolent fury. It is not her brother, though, and she's too scared to go back.It's at this point that the story seems to veer in another direction, but does it? That is the heart of the movie. As viewers, we are never sure exactly what we are seeing. Events begin to happen quickly, and as I said if you miss a scene it may alter your view of the film. Stewart's character misses many important points in her own story; her inattention to the happenings in her own life affect events in the movie. She may be psychic but she also seems to have a wicked short attention span. Spirits may show themselves, but she's either misinterpreting the signals or missing them alltogether.I loved this movie; I purchased the Criterion release but didn't see it in the theatre, and I wish I had. As I said it's slow moving and quiet, but momentous things happen. Stewart is absolutely right for the part. She has a knack for looking like she's caught in the headlights of an oncoming car, forever uncertain of what's going on and surprised by it; she's never ahead of the script but always catching up, belatedly reactive. Always running away from her job, Paris, London, and the events that happen to her, she's constantly either arriving or departing. It's the kind of film you have to watch, to know if you like it or not."

" A Movie Better Titled ""Kristen Stewart Sleepwalks""
",0.4404,0.905,2018-05-10 00:00:00,2,"***** SPOILER ALERT***** I don't even want to be here spending the time writing this review of this totally pretentious, totally Kristen Stewart centered movie. Whoever wrote that the art film crowd would love this movie was exactly right. I am amused that an ""atmospheric"" film like this is supposed to be so brilliant to them. It was thin on plot, we endured boring minutes dragging by of Stewart, hair all tousled, needing a shower, head down, wandering around different apartments in Paris and finally in Muskat. Supposedly looking for contact from her dead brother with whom she made a pact at some point in her life, to contact her if he died first. There is a completely useless scene that took up about 10 minutes (or at least it felt like 10 minutes) where she is at a doctor's office where he explains she has a congenital heart defect which, like the entire movie, might or might not kill her like it did her twin brother, Lewis. All of the scenes felt disjointed and Stewart's acting was horribly one dimensional. There are times when she is drawing pictures. Why? There are conversations that are stilted and lead nowhere. Why? But I think the worst part, for me, was how incredibly bad the supposed ghost scenes were. Her brother was a medium, so she claims she is, too. Really? Because I saw nothing convincing about that. There are glasses moving in the air and dropping and breaking, there are faucets turned on. There are random texts which she keeps answering and I kept thinking, TURN YOUR PHONE OFF! The most interesting part of the movie and why it got 2/10, was the murder of the woman for whom she was a personal shopper. This rich, high profile, fashion conscious woman hires this disheveled, obviously not into fashion at all, woman to be her personal shopper? I don't think so. I thought when Stewart found the body, that FINALLY, something was going to happen. Nope! We fast forward to her meeting Lewis' girlfriend in a restaurant and Stewart tells her they found the killer named Ingo (the rich woman's ex boyfriend, I think, but again, if there was a worthy moment in this movie I would look it up). Stewart has a boyfriend who is doing I.T. work in Muskat. We see him briefly two times. She ends up in a spartan apartment in Muskat and there, evidently, is confronted by the spirit. Stupid glass breaking again. Stupid knocks on a wall. Stupid questions she asks. And suddenly, with no warning, everything fades to white and credits come up. OK, I am an average person who watches Grey's Anatomy and loves British murder mysteries. They have a beginning, a middle and an ending. This movie? Stewart sleep walks through the role and I defy ANYBODY to take issue with that. Her brother's girlfriend had two Labrador Retrievers that were more interesting than Stewart! If you go to art galleries and love to fake interest in modern art, you will probably love this movie. If you love Kristen Stewart, trust me, you get her every single boring minute in this movie. You will love this. If you are an average person who works, raises or raised a family, who isn't rich or pretentious because there isn't time for that nonsense, you will waste precious moments better spent with family, or even your dog or cat! I REALLY hate the movies today without any sort of ending. I know, I know. It's ""fresh"" and (again) ""atmospheric."" NO! It's rude and maybe you just couldn't think of an ending because you are trying so hard to be shown at Cannes Film Festival! (Which it was!) I really wish we could go back to the 90s movies, the Love Actually's the French Kiss', back when movies were actually exceptionally acted with real closure. Because it's getting very old not having endings to movies these days! Depending on which crowd you fall into, you will either love this movie or, like me, find it incredibly dull, poorly acted (a rag doll could have done better), and should have been named ""All About Kristen."" Although, (can I say it enough?) she was absolutely, one dimensionally awful in this film. Don't waste your time, average people!"

" Not really sure what it's all about
",-0.2912,-0.9928,2018-04-26 00:00:00,3,"Well, I just can say to I should not have believed to the hype of the good review. I mean, I really don't know what the movie is all about. Is it about ghost, murderer, crime, hallucination, paranormal super power, sixth sense, or what? Perhaps it's just me whom being the moron, but I really don't understand the correct theme to describe the movie.The story begins from out of nowhere of our lead role named Maureen (played by Kristen Stewart) suddenly arrive at a house, in Paris. Yes, she did explain why she was in Paris, in which apparently to seek a ""sign"" from her dead twin-brother because they made such an agreement of who die first should ""communicate"" to each other. Yes, they both had the ability of the sixth sense, even maybe her twin-brother had a more powerful sixth sense because he used to be a medium to communicate with spirits. 
But, I just couldn't find the connection between the house (that is sold and and apparently haunted by a ghost that had no connection to the story of course, and i keep guessing why on earth the ghost appeared in the first place?), the occupation of Maureen as a personal shopper, the death of the model who hire her service, and the mysterious caller. The story is messy, I think, and it leads to nowhere. But it's wrapped and helped by the beauty of the Paris city ambiance. So it is a remedy for the eyes. 
It is not psychological thriller or anything, in fact it is not thrilling at all. Is it a mystery? Yes, definitely, you'll keep guessing where the story is going, because it's going nowhere until the end. And the problem appeared before just disappear and unsolved.There is no suspense, no tension, no horror, I personally don't know why they put this movie into the horror genre. Kinda bored me to death."

The end result is a highly unfocused piece that bounces around between story points without ever really connecting the dots, fluttering from a character-based ghost story to a pseudo psycho-sexual thriller and back again, to the point where even a major murder mystery seems inconsequential. There are also a few plot pretensions in 'Personal Shopper (2016)' that are simply pretentious, serving only to add confusion rather than mystery, and the flick finishes ten minutes too late to be anything other than annoying (seriously, the perfect enigmatic ending happens and then the film just carries on). It also frustratingly treats its supernatural elements as ambiguous when we have been overtly shown them several times before, so - despite a few decently compelling sequences - the overall experience sadly falls pretty flat. 5/10"

Or are you hyperkinetic due to an overdose of cola during a night of ""binge watching""? No problem. Simply start the movie ""Personal shopper"" and these problems have been solved without any doubt. If there would be a Oscar category called ""Most boring film of the year"", this film would have won it easily. In short: The whole movie you'll see Maureen (Kristen Stewart) do some shopping for a high-society model named Kyra (Nora von Waldstätten), driving around in Paris on her moped, meditate while smoking lots of cigarettes and sending a whole series of messages on her iPhone. And she's also waiting for a sign of life (how ambiguous) of her recently deceased brother Lewis. Apart from some ectoplasm and flickering light phenomena, there's nothing ghostly to see. A sleep-inducing performance. And even the few scenes in which Stewart walks around half-naked and even masturbates, won't help. Her cup size is of the same caliber as this film. Meagre.Maybe I'm a bit biased, because I'm immensily annoyed by the person Kristen Stewart. On the other hand. You need a film character who doesn't feel good about herself and who's constantly in a melancholic mood, she's surely the right candidate. If there's an actress you can admire a whole movie without showing one sincere smile and a face that seems to be dipped in starch, then she's definitely the one. I still remember this quote : ""Kristen Stewart is like my refrigerator, no matter what I put in it (milk, soda, eggs, vegetables, meat), it's always a refrigerator. And so is she"". I really can't understand why she's being praised by everybody. And every time I read about her, superlatives like ""authenticity"" and ""subtle"" are being used. Well, you can also say that about the Scarlett Johanssons, Saoirse Ronans, Dakota Fanningsen and even the Jennifer Lawrences in Hollywood. The only difference is that these actresses show some variation in their facial expressions.""Personal Shopper"" is once again an arthouse creation. And the artificial world of fashion fits extremely well with it. Both the film and the world of fashion have the same irritating effect on me. They create an artificial product that is reasonably pretentious and targets the group of the happy few. The arthouse film lovers are those happy few who are able to see the abstract meaning and the symbolisme behind such an intellectual film. In the fashion world, the happy few are those who can afford an exclusive sewn together piece of confection. And after a certain time they'll loudly proclaim that this expensive piece of cloth is out of fashion. By the way. Who can explain to me the usefulness of such a wire-shaped corset that Maureen wears at a certain moment? The connoisseurs will most likely scream bloody murder and call me a retard who doesn't understand fashion. I hope for myself that that it'll remain like that.Which subject this film tries to tackle, is not so easy to interpret. On the one hand there's the spiritual issue and the connection of the living with wandering souls. On the other hand there is the subject of materialistic thinking and the impersonal world in which we live. The primordial conversation between Maureen and the unknown (the bouncing dots and plopping sounds really started to get on my nerves after a while) is also a reference to the contemporary impersonal conversations among individuals. So how to interprete this movie? I guess you could explain it in many ways. Best you fill in the gaps yourself after watching this movie. Keep in mind that Maureen waits for the unknown person in a hotel room and shortly thereafter you'll see doors open automatically without seeing anybody. That puts the whole in a completely different perspective. Or not? If not, then I think that the very last bang is a clear statement. But you had need endurance to sit out this long ride and witness this slightly intense moment. Ending with Maureen looking straight at the camera. Emotionless. Trust me. Me and Kirsten Stewart. That'll never work out.More reviews here : http://movie-freak.be"

" An uneasy mix
",-0.3818,-0.5221,2018-03-12 00:00:00,6,"I think the main problem with ""Personal Shopper"" was its insistence at shoehorning supernatural aspects into an otherwise straight story about a young woman in mourning who works on the fringes of celebrity.Or is it that they shoehorned in serious dramatic elements into an otherwise straightforward supernatural thriller?Either way, it was not a good fit. To me, the movie feels more like the first one: the pace is slow and observant of this woman and her strange job, the people around her largely distant and inaccessible. Moreover, the movie makes what I feel was a fatal error of judgment when it provides a visual depiction of a supernatural presence. For one thing, the effect is unconvincing. But how can something like that look ""realistic""? Put it in a slow, realistic film that seems to be set in the pre-mourning stage for everybody concerned, and it just doesn't fit. Assayas should have kept the ghosts, if that's what they are, off-screen.What we end up with is a movie which is too slow and unwound to really capture your attention for long, and a ghost story in the background that would have been more effective if they had ditched the ""personal shopper"" aspect of the story and allowed that to take centre stage.Kristen Stewart, as always, plays a character who has supposedly undergone loss, but it is impossible to believe her as someone who is grief-stricken.

" Personal Shopper balances abstract themes to create a chilling story that conveys grief.
",-0.296,0.9941,2018-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Much like you and me, we read plenty of reviews that stated ""slowest film ever"" or ""Kristen Stewart cannot act"". Naturally I became apprehensive, however I am glad to report that those comments can be negated. This was absolutely terrific! A personal shopper to a highly prolific fashion icon attempts to reach out to her recently deceased twin brother. Determined to receive a message to signify his presence in the afterlife, she resides in his home but with unconventional results. This character piece was tantalisingly intense where the drama captivated me and the thrills remained electrifying. Portraying grief, sorrow, solitude and melancholia as one individual was a tricky task, but it works successfully on a multitude of levels. Her experiences with the supernatural dilutes her own identity, grieving is a powerful emotive experience that changes people. She, much like myself, is much like a closed book and retains her feelings which creates a cold barrier that surrounds her. Unresponsive, tranquil and impressionable, the character of Maureen was a beautiful incarnation of sadness. Bolstered by a career best performance from Stewart. I kid you not, one of the best performances I've seen and one that I shall remember for quite some time. Assayas' direction was technically perfect. Lovely long takes through the uninhabited house, the urban streets of Paris and fashionable apartments. Much like the garments, his style felt trendy and modern and I really admire that reciprocation. The tonal shifts between a contemporary drama and ghost story don't always work, and the scene transitions were simply uninspired which is a shame. But that text message exchange though! Utterly gripping, the most intense series of iMessages I've seen (and that's including my texts...). It even concludes ambiguously, which pretty much sums this unconventional taut drama up. Ambiguously sumptuous. If you like spoon fed narratives, then move along. The rest of you, dig in...immediately."
" Rather disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.7546,2018-02-19 00:00:00,5,"Maureen (Kristen Stewart) is an American living in Paris whose job is to buy clothes for a wealthy supermodel. Maureen's twin brother has recently died and she attempts to connect with his spirit in the large house on the outskirts of Paris where he lived before his death.Stewart's natural talent and presence are a great aid to this film. She's at her best during a scene involving a police interrogation. But too much of the film focuses only on Maureen when she is alone. This includes an unbearably long sequence that involved her exchanging text messages with a mysterious stranger. Stewart's talents can alleviate this movie's flaws but only up to a point.The movie also suffers from having too many sub-stories none of which seem to meet their potential. The ""ghost story"" has some mysterious moments but ends with too much unresolved mystery. The narrative involving Maureen's relationship with her mostly absent boss (Nora von Waldstatten) could have benefited the movie overall with more time and exploration. The boss shows up in one scene which is almost comical. She is an obsessive egomaniac who multi-tasks while bullying someone on a conference call as she is trying to save gorillas. The final narrative involves a murder mystery whose impact seems to disappear once the mystery is solved.Considering the film's unearned acclaim - plus the fact that it was made by the talented creator (Olivier Assayas) of such great films as ""Irma Vep"", ""Summer Hours"" and ""Carlos"", this movie is sadly disappointing."

To people who might make it to the end here´s a fine minimalistic drama that holds back from many clichés, a serious story, too serious maybe. There are a couple of great moments but it isn´t really rewarding. It just disguises a realistic drama as a ghost story, which is not the best idea cause it calls for an audience bound to be disappointed.

Laughable special effects (hovering cups, things that go bump in the night etc etc) are coupled with the preposterous suggestion that somebody has chosen to employ and trust the incredibly surly, heroin-chic Maureen to purchase clothes, bags and jewelry suitable for a high-flyer. Occasionally Maureen takes her top off (which even as a red-blooded male seemed to me to be exploitative), tries the clothes on (after being told not to) and does some more exploitative solo-girl action on a bed.
In between all this Maureen tries to contact her dead brother because she is a medium (possibly revised down to a small after seeing her topless). Eventually it all ends ambiguously. The 'arty' set love this film. Only because, and presumably that is why Ms Stewart agrees to take her clothes off, they collectively believe that if a film has a French director it must be dark, atmospheric and stylish rather than what it actually is: Pretentious, soulless and meaningless."

About a young woman in Paris who is severely dented by the loss of her brother, and refuses to leave the city until she manages to contact the spirit of her brother and gets what I can only describe as answers.Kristen Stewart is an actress I always thought lacked any real charisma or talent, this is illustrated perfectly with her performance in Personal Shopper, what was she trying to achieve and where on earth was her heart and the passion for the role she was playing?It dares to be different and drastically fails at doing so, another so called B movie that fails to do anything but disappoint; I found it so difficult to sit through that my mind switched off mid way through and what happened in the second part of the film is all a blur unfortunately."

" Not terrible but not great
",-0.5667,0.7882,2018-01-01 00:00:00,5,"I get I that people want to applaud the genre-shifting and deliberate and sparse screenplay and the flat-affect acting from Kristen Stewart but for me the slightly experimental delivery doesn't make up for a ludicrous plot.
Somehow in the world, you need to believe that a group of normal, modern, cosmopolitan people with jobs like carpentry, shopping for glamorous philanthropists and high-level information technology have all whole-heartedly bought into the idea of mediums able to open portals between this world and the next.
Then, in order to fill in some of the gaping narrative holes, you have to believe the lead character, until now presented as a reticent, insular sort of person somehow is ok about divulging her plan to try to interpret communication from her dead twin brother to a complete, and kind of creepy, stranger.
When we get a proper ghosty it ends being the sort likely to turn up in Ghostbusters, without any of the film's stylistic edginess.
There is some sort of identity theme in here. Lead character Maureen is challenged to become someone else, to uncouple herself from her stated values, and to expose herself to her deepest, darkest fears (which are hardly deep or dark, and which are weirdly exposed in the course of an SMS exchange with someone who may or may not be the spirit of someone - a spirit presumably with a lot of time on their hands). 
I guess there's also an intent to challenge us to consider whether the relationship we feel with spirit - of people, places, things - is 'real' or if we confect it in order to stabilise ourselves, or our belief systems.
These are useful things to think about but the film is so determined to be challenging and cool that the ending is hardly any sort of punctuation at all, and the characters (well, the one character allowed to do anything of note), and their challenges are really not that interesting.
Props to everyone for trying something different; well-done to Stewart for doing some pretty solid acting of a 'dead-inside' character; and kudos to the producers who work with a multinational task across at least three countries.

" Kristen Stewart's infatuation with art house films paid off again
",0.1531,0.9686,2017-12-30 00:00:00,8,"I dived into this movie without any anticipation, only to be impressed by its innate power. Personal Shopper centers around the protagonist's endeavors to communicate with her deceased twin brother in Paris where he passed away. As a horror feature, it dutifully provides substantial scares throughout. One scene in particular features the popping-ups of menacing text messages, which is arguably the most intense sequence of any horror production this year. On top of that, I was thoroughly blown away by the scenery of this film. Set in Paris, Personal Shopper abounds with French elements, be it the language, the architecture or culture, which is a feast for the eyes and ears, and a good balance of the unsettling happenings in the movie. Plus, I love the director's subtle jab at materialism, which is hinted at multiple times throughout this movie. Most importantly, Kristen Stewart's acting skills are the true cherry on top of this already immaculate gem. She has segued from a blockbuster fixture to the indie it girl over the past few years, and I have to admit she's made a clever career move. 
In short, Personal Shopper is an Euro arty thriller with a captivating story, effective scares, top notch acting as well as messages (no pun intended). Definitely one of the better horror efforts of 2017."

Then Maureen is being harassed by an unknown person via text message. She communicates with them on a somewhat casual basis. Then suddenly the model Maureen works for is murdered and Maureen is very briefly a suspect before some man apparently escapes a poorly executed attempted abduction in mid-day.

Then the movie abruptly ends.
It wasn't an altogether horrible movie, but the tone of the horror sequences were completely off from the rest of the movie, as if done as re-shoots to change the movie entirely. The ending also was completely inexplicable. I get the attempt to try to be esoteric or cryptic with a seemingly inexplicable ending, but this ending was not seemingly inexplicable, it was COMPLETELY inexplicable. Absolutely nothing in the movie preceding it in any way provided a basis, foundation, clue, or even a red herring that could possibly set it up.The ending was like something out of a completely different movie we did not watch, much like the horror sequences.

I've never liked her and have never understood why others do. She always seems to be p*ssed off in the way that sulky teenagers are always p*ssed off, or she's sullenly morose, in a way that feels vapid rather than deep. But then I saw her in ""Personal Shopper,"" Olivier Assayas's enigmatic rumination on the tenuousness of life, and while I don't know that her performance has permanently changed my mind, it did make clear to me that I can like Stewart when given the right vehicle and role.In ""Personal Shopper,"" Stewart plays Maureen, a young troubled woman drifting through Paris as the personal assistant to a petulant celebrity. She hates her job, but she won't leave Paris until she has used her self-identified skills as a medium to communicate with her recently dead brother, whose death she can not get over. She soon starts getting text messages from someone who won't identify him or herself, and who eventually leads Stewart into a murder investigation.That murder investigation doesn't take place until very late into the movie, and it's not really important to the plot. This is not a movie about what happens to Maureen but rather about what happens inside Maureen's head. She spends her days living someone else's life, and the film suggests that this half life is possible for all of us if we let it be, living in the world but not of it.Those seeking tidy answers will be frustrated by this movie, but of course if that's what people want they shouldn't be watching an Assayas movie in the first place. I enjoyed the film's ambiguity, and I actually thought it was pretty accessible even if Assayas's methods are a bit unconventional. The last scene of the film strikes the perfect balance between eerie and sad and goes down as one of the more memorable conclusions to any film I've seen this year.Grade: A"
" From Beyond the Grave
",-0.3818,-0.8775,2017-12-04 00:00:00,7,"Haunted by a promise that her recently deceased twin brother made to contact her from beyond the grave, a young woman begins to wonder if her brother could be behind a series of intimidating text messages in this horror film with a difference. This is not a movie for all tastes with lots of repetitive shots of lead actress Kristen Stewart wandering around her brother's house at night, trying to work out if every echo and creek is his ghost. There are also endless scenes of her buying clothes for a celebrity who she works for in Paris. Much of this repetitiveness is thematically relevant though when one considers the grief and loss themes of the movie. Some have been quick to criticise the inconclusive ending, but it fits in well with the movie's portrait of a woman destined to wallow in grief forever since she will never be able to prove whether her brother truly is able to communicate with her from beyond. Her occupation is curious too, acting as a ghost-like twin for a busy celebrity, and the film has several intense moments. The best scene is a train ride in which she comes to suspect that the mysterious text sender may be watching her. This scene has all the intensity of 'Unfriended' with a jolt felt every time her phone vibrates/dings. Unfortunately, director Olivier Assayas seldom places her phone screen in focus, but then there is lots to like in how he simply lets Stewart react in increasingly unhinged ways to what she is receiving on it. Add in some inventive costumes and tasteful topless scenes and this is an easy film to recommend. One does need to proceed with some caution though because the slow pace, constant ambiguity and lack of overt scares will no doubt cause frustration for those expecting something else."

The movie stars Kristen Stewart, and it was written and directed by Olivier Assayas (the two previously worked together on 2014's 'CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA'). It also costars Nora von Waldstätten, Lars Eidinger, Sigrid Bouaziz, Anders Danielsen Lie and Ty Olwin. The film was well received at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, where it premiered, and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be interesting, and well made mostly, but nothing special or memorable really. Maureen (Stewart) works as a personal assistant for a celebrity named Kyra (Waldstätten). Her job mostly consists of traveling to European capitols, in order to shop for Kyra (by trying on different clothes, shoes and jewelry for her). Maureen secretly dresses in these expensive (recently purchased) clothes as well, when she's alone at night. She also continuously tries to contact her recently deceased twin brother, because before he died they both promised each other they would try to make contact with one other, from the afterlife (if there is one). Maureen is also harassed by persistent texts from an unknown number, who she thinks might be the spirit of her dead brother. The movie is somewhat interesting, but it's also really slow-paced. It also seems severely unbalanced as well, with the supernatural elements seeming somewhat out of place (with the rest of the story) too. Stewart is really good in the lead role, but her character is the only relatable, or likable, one in the whole movie. I think the film was well directed, and the story is at least somewhat interesting too.

I don't think so.It would have probably been glossed over, certainly the exalted people behind the Palme D'Or or the Cannes Film Festival wouldn't have given it the idea of a thought, and the world would have moved on as it always does, indifferent and cold and hard and rash and humming it's own tune, whether you like it or not. Isn't it sad that they steal our ideas from us and incorporate them as their own, and they get prizes for that theft, and if we try to do something similar, we're seen as terrorists that should be found, fixed and finished? Absolutely terrible hypocrisy and racism.That being said, Stewart's performance was really something. Here she is, trying to exist in two worlds, a raunchy materialistic world where's she's ""shopping"" for someone famous, buying this and buying that, while at the same time existing in the spiritual, ethereal world where she's trying to receive contact from her dead brother. And in failing to choose one over the other, she drives herself to the edge of insanity. Does she go over? See the movie and decide for yourself.

Think part of the reason is the director, Olivier Assayas couldn't decide what kind of film they were making. Is it a ghost story, a murder mystery or an artsy character study about the loss of a sibling and existence of an afterlife? Personal Shopper is a bit each with a touch of the Devil Wears Prada sprinkled on top... The director also chose not to develop his main character to any extent, perhaps it's a French film/director thing and I just don't get it. Night shots of Paris were good but the paranormal interactions were not very effective, goofy/funny actually. Also the amount of screen time given to the Kristen Steward character texting was absurd. Sorry, texting is not a replacement for dialog and story. But for me the biggest flaw was the lack of continuity between scenes during a critical encounter involving the main character in a hotel. The enormous story gap is never resolved, just hangs out there through the end of the film. Again, maybe it's a French film thing but it doesn't work for me. Lastly the ending sucked big time. Might have worked with David Fincher directing."
" But is it a scary movie, work or esoteric?
",-0.6486,-0.7521,2017-10-22 00:00:00,3,"I think the fundamental problem of this film is that it does not clarify where it wants to go. The title says one thing and then the main story says another. But the subplots are too long.Kristen would be great, if it was not because she's always the same. It does not convey anything to me. It leaves me very cold and is not a subject to leave you cold.If I had gone for the topic that I believe is going to be the brother's, I could have been well, because the effects it puts on are well achieved, because in those moments it catches you, but then it goes to other subjects than the truth, I'm not interested at all. Another problem is to make such a white photograph in a film of this type, photography has to accompany the plot and does not accompany it precisely.The direction, since it does not clear up or know where to go, since it spends a lot of time with things that do not interest, it is not good. He does not know how to count the camera. The tempo does not get along very well.I was not expecting it that way and it was for the worse."

Chiefly employed as a personal shopper for a Parisian celebrity, Maureen (Kristen Stewart) spends a great deal of her time trying to contact her deceased twin brother who died of the same heart condition she has. When she receives a text from an unknown source she concludes that it came from her dead sibling.Meanwhile, her boss' dead body has just been found and Maureen is the police's prime suspect.Understated with moments of terror and ethereal cinematography to match Stewart's aloof performance, this esoteric study on spiritualism slowly pierces the veil in an innocuous yet haunting fashion that makes this ghost story subtly scary.Mind you, male ghosts haunting clothing stores tend to linger around the change rooms.

I don't like movies that finish and you just don't know what happened. I didn't enjoy this one bit. It's dark and not meaningful. I would say: watch something else instead.
" Vintage horror, mystery and drama, beautifully crafted.
",0.0,-0.9307,2017-10-02 00:00:00,9,"Let me preface by saying something that shouldn't be controversial: Ms. Stewart is a good (great) actress. She is better than that concocted star Jennifer Lawrence. (Apples and oranges, right?). Oh! That Academy debacle - Lawrence is in no way better (or gave any better performance) than Emmanuelle Riva.I, sincerely, don't understand about what people are talking when dismissing Kristen Stewart's acting. (Sometimes I think people are in another reality and seeing something different from me). Maybe most people like overacting, melodramatic acting, pseudo-Shakespearean acting, soap-opera acting, etc., but I surely don't.Personal Shopper is a wonderful character-driven film (if you can only seat through a film with a thick or very tightly woven plot you may not like this) about a young woman who lost a brother with whom she had a strange (or perhaps more common than I believe) agreement that consists of making contact from after-life (if there's such, which I believe not) with each other. Both are self-identified mediums. Both have (he had) a heart condition which can kill the carrier seemingly out of nowhere. So, she hangs around Paris (where her brother died) waiting for his contact from the beyond. (To a cynical sceptic like myself this premise should sound ridiculous, but, alas!, is not and the film was capable of enchanting me even).The so-called profession that gives the film its title is boring (and the main character knows). She goes around Europe and England buying and renting high-end clothes and jewellery for a high-profile personality of the fashion milieu. Boring. But the character is not boring and Stewart's performance just kept me watching with interest (almost without blinking).There are ghosts (or not); a peculiar murder plot that is a somewhat side note (very refreshing in my opinion); hints of madness (or not). Again, Stewart's performance is really mesmerizing.The film have a classic tone to its composition, and, at the same time, a very modern, organic feel. We see things happening with a character and that is it. The grieving sibling story was done before, of course, but how it is done in Personal Shopper feels fresh to me. Avoiding every Hollywood cheapness. (Hollywood is awful in my opinion).Drama, horror, and mystery perfectly bound together. Personal Shopper surprised me. A wonderfully well crafted film that avoids being a cheap Hollywood-we-need-to-win-a-prize- (or) -we-need-to-scare-you-using-loud-noises film without wondering to much to the side of art-house pretentiousness (a shame to me, because I like pretentious).I was thinking of writing something with more depth about this film, but, on second thought, who would read?* Big plus for that short scene with Anders Danielsen Lie close to the ending."
" ""Personal Shopper"" a triumph
",0.4767,0.9971,2017-09-17 00:00:00,8,"It has been five years since Kristen Stewart completed the teen vampire/ werewolf movies in the five film 'Twilight' series, adapted from Stephanie Meyer's best selling books. It would be incorrect to say this was Stewart's big break – that came in 2002 playing Jodie Fosters diabetic daughter in David Fincher's ""Panic Room"". From that 2002 film until 2008 when ""Twilight"" was released she had been making waves in mostly independent films. However, where she once was a young woman with acting talent, we are now witnessing the talent promised for so long in two of her better films, the 2014 ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" and the release this week in New Zealand of ""Personal Shopper"" (2016), both written and directed expertly by Frenchman Olivier Assayas.""Personal Shopper"" revolves around Maureen, a personal shopper, who serves wealthy clients in major cities, buying clothes and accessories, and taking care of mundane chores. She lives in Paris but travels to London and other cities for her employment. Her fraternal twin and brother has recently died; they both had a similar genetic heart problem, as well as this they both believed they had connections to the spirit world, her brother more than she.Opening the film, Maureen stays over at her late brother's house, hoping he will reach her beyond death. His significant other Lara wants to sell the house, and buyers want to know it is free of unhappy spirits. The film suggests what she sees and reacts to, including a series of knowing texts received even while she is on a train to and during her time in London, from ""Unknown"". She believes she is in touch with ghosts.This film really suits Stewart and what has become her signature acting style, as such she is suited for this role like no other at the same age. Stewart, at the age of only twenty-seven is amassing a nice oeuvre of work like no other, except for maybe Jennifer Lawrence – although the fact that Stewart has spread her wings well as working with many Europeans in Europe says a lot about the kind of actress she is choosing to become. In saying that Stewart does not have to chase a payday, as the residuals from the 'Twilight' films will keep her in the black for the rest of her life – which must be a nice luxury.Stewart's Maureen is a woman who is facing a crisis as well as something that has been stalking her for the entirety of her life, that is, the possible impending death of herself and/or her brother – this is a concept that most people from her economic and social background don't face until much later in life. Stewart handles this with aplomb as her style and mannerisms suits this character down to the ground. She seems to be relishing the opportunity to be working with a European like Assayas (again) as well as the subject matter of the two films she has made with him.One of the great things about Stewart is her ability to play supporting parts to other actresses as well as her ability to not seem to have an ego for her on-screen personas. Assayas shoots Stewart in close up with these shots not being complementary as we see imperfections in her face as well as the age that she has seemed to gain through the stresses of her very existence. It is something to see an actress willing to give up her 'look', not to have makeup or to play a 'real' person that is not perfect looking. It is a juxtaposition between the glam pictures you may see of Stewart to this flawed, haunted as well as haunting person that is searching for some truth and perhaps closure.Olivier Assayas has had a long career as well as being a force in French and International cinema for years, he has made a wide variety of films in multiple genres, he has to be one of the more prolific directors in the world today. He also enjoys partnerships with actors, hopefully this is the start of something with Stewart who he obviously enjoys working with – it must also help get a budget when you have a champion with such international clout and awareness.There are many elements to this film that make it unique to the environment it has been released into, it co-opts many genres to give us twists on each one. I loved this movie, but it would be nothing without Stewart who is perhaps shaping to be the actress of her generation."
" Spoilers follow ...
",0.0,-0.8587,2017-09-07 00:00:00,8,"Scruffy, intense Maureen (Kristen Stewart) is personal shopper to high-profile celebrity Kyra (Nora von Waldstätten). She wanders unconcernedly through magnificent Parisian and European streets, taking long journeys to spacious shops that sell ridiculously over-priced clothes. Occasionally she feels she is visited by the spirit of her dead twin brother Lewis, who died from a heart defect she also suffers from. This doesn't dissuade her from smoking though! She spends a lot of her time alone in Lewis's former massive, shambling house which proves the perfect place for a haunting. Only two small problems – firstly, it begins to dawn on her that this un-benign spirit might not be her brother. Secondly, the CGI used to show us the apparition, although subtle, is a bit  CGI. Computer cartoon. This is surprising as other, much more subtle effects are expertly handled later on. The acting is suitably detached. All hesitant and stuttering, awkward and halting, with characters talking over each other. This seems to be an artistic decision, Director Olivier Assayas apparently wanting the demonstrate Maureen's sense of stylish isolation in this way: it does make some of the dialogue difficult to make out. After a series of text messages from a stranger, who Maureen believes is her brother, she begins tentatively to break the rules of her employment and wear some of the garments she has procured for Kyra. Clonking around the spacious apartment in haute couture and high heels feels (and looks) alien to Maureen.It's difficult to know where this is all heading.And suddenly, returning to Kyra's flat after more personal shopping and finding her employer gruesomely murdered, things instantly become very frightening. The addition of strange violent banging sounds somewhere inside don't help ease Maureen's nerves, and shortly she is being interrogated by the police. What happens isn't clear, but it seems to me that Lewis IS the mysterious texter: he appears to help her trap the real killer, Kyra's former boyfriend Ingo (Lars Eidinger).Now free, Maureen goes to visit boyfriend Gary (Ty Olwen) in the mountains. Once there, she is again confronted by the ghostly spirit who communicates with her.'Personal Shopper' is a film designed to attract extreme views: you'll either love it or hate it. I loved it, but I can sympathise with those who complain about drawn-out scenes watching Kirsten Stewart texting. There is a lot of that, but I had no problem with it. As much as anything, I enjoyed the vast, panoramic shots of various cities and locations; there was a definite comparison between Maureen's self-contained world and the hugeness of everything outside it.It's a long 'un: 105 minutes - and it moves very slowly. I have a love for this approach to horror films anyway, and so would strongly recommend it. You could get gloriously lost in Maureen's strange world, but you have to give it a chance."

" Stewart Bares All - (all two of them)
",0.0,-0.6049,2017-09-03 00:00:00,2,"I kept falling asleep during this movie, so I really have no idea what it was about. There were scenes with Stewart striding about an old house and prying open doors; there's a scene where she is having a cryptic conversation with a guy who has a strong German (?) accent. She's telling someone she is medium and can communicate with the dead. She's lighting a cigarette. She's lighting another cigarette. She's being examined by a doctor without one of those paper gowns on so we get to see her sweet breasts (gratuitous nudity in my opinion). Everything is grey/blue and depressing and ultimately pointless."
" A subtle, yet deeply effective, psychological drama
",0.5256,0.9839,2017-09-02 00:00:00,9,"Assayas has done it again, it seems. After the delectably rich Clouds of Sils Maria, Assayas has once again spurred a sublime performance from Kristen Stewart in this illusive, cerebral horror film that, even with a goofy scene that should belong in the latest Ghostbuster film, remains sophisticated and truly haunting.As showcased in his last film, Olivier Assayas is ingenious when it comes to writing stories around his deeply engaging characters, and Personal Shopper is no exception. Stewart is incredibly convincing in her role as a damaged clairvoyant, still shaken by the death of her twin brother. Every scene works to add little pieces to her character that helps to greater understand her actions and rather subdued personality. This is easily the best Stewart has ever been, previous performances considered. She is certainly someone to lookout for in the future, as, at this point, she is a frontrunner of the next generation of actors. What is also undeniably impressive is Assayas' ability to tell a story in a heavily visual, almost poetic, way. He, unlike many directors working today, knows when to just let his actors ACT, allowing them to demonstrate their character building talents through minuscule movements and mannerisms that can't quite be explained through spoken dialogue. It's all so gorgeously organic.From the masterful building of tension leading to terrifyingly subtle moments of horror, to Kristen Stewart's brilliant performance, Personal Shopper oozes professionalism. A film that meticulously finds ways to crawl right under the skin of the viewer and linger with them days after."
" Interesting art-house flick
",0.4019,0.8261,2017-09-01 00:00:00,7,"Personal Shopper is a movie from the director of ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" and also stars Kristen Stewart once again. In this movie Kristen plays a character whose twin brother dies and she's looking for his ghost. They both believed in the afterlife and they promised to each other that when one of them days, they have to make contact to the other from afterlife.It probably sounds like I just described a beginning of a horror movie, but this movie is far from that. It's very weird, but it's very interesting too. While not really fun (well, it was never really fun to watch an art-house movie, the fun part comes after when you discuss it and try to figure out what the hell happened), it's certainly interesting. All three acts are very different from each other. The first act is almost a horror movie. The second act is the weak part of the movie, I really can't categorize it, maybe I psychological drama? I don't know, it's very slow paced and it's basically just Kristen Stewart's character shopping, texting and occasionally doing weird stuff. What's an art-house film without characters who randomly do something weird? And the third act is, again, a bit thrillerish with some supernatural elements. It's also a very ambiguous movie and leaves a lot of food for thought, but sometimes it's taken too far and important plot points are showed off- screen. Honestly, I wouldn't even mind it that much if the middle was interesting. In that case there would at least be some kind of balance. This way, it feels a bit off. But the ending is a great example of how to achieve ambiguity in a film. And in the less interesting parts, a bright spot was Kristen Stewart who carried the entire film extremely well and shows that she is one of the most interesting young actresses today. Too bad she's only popular for her worst roles.Overall, this was an interesting art-house film that could have been more interesting, but with its ambiguity, it leaves you thinking."
" Multiple Unrelated Movies Mashed Together that Somehow Mostly Works
",0.0,0.99,2017-08-30 00:00:00,6,"Personal Shopper follows a woman whose job is to be a personal shopper for a famous model, meanwhile her brother has recently passed away and she attempts to communicate with him from the spirit world. For starters, the directing is pretty great, right from the opening scene. Olivier Assayas clearly has a great idea of how to hold the camera to invoke a particular mood or portray a certain idea. In my opinion, he's the best part of the movie. Another one of the best things about this movie is Kristen Stewart. While she can be a little inconsistent, specifically with her line delivery from time to time, she is largely very good in this role, and it's really nice to see her continuing to try and do well at acting after Twilight. As far as the story goes, it's kind of a mess. As I'm sure you got that same vibe from my plot synopsis, there's a lot going on with none of those events really relating to each other at all. While I think it's interesting that Assayas decided to take a very different route with this movie, it's still just a little jarring how unusual and unrelated so much of it is. While I never questioned or got angry at the movie tone or character wise, it's still just a little weird to think about. And at times, the flow was lost a little with the awkwardness of all the entirely different plot points. Overall I liked Personal Shopper. It's a very unconventional movie, and it's certainly not for everyone. While the directing and acting is solid, the story as a whole is very unrelated and weird, and it comes off as pretentious a lot of the time. Furthermore, the pacing suffers as a result of all these story lines that feel like they should be different movies altogether. In the end there are very few people I'd recommend this movie to."

Kristin has made some great movies in the past and we were looking forward to this ""horror"" movie. I'm guessing the producers were banking on her to widen their audience and cash them all up. Once this film was over in our household it was unanimous that it would have been switched off after 20 minutes. We were so optimistic and hoping it would improve but no luck at all of that happening. Do yourself a favour and spend your money on a real horror movie. This film would have no hope of scaring anyone."
" Shopping- can you show me something else?
",0.0,0.9828,2017-08-28 00:00:00,6,"Personal Shopper (a rather banal and impersonal title) falls in that class of film I previously called ""Palme d'Or bait"" in that it fits that mold of a number of films that won Cannes in the past 12 years: a European film with a hyper-realist, clean style, long takes, no score, usually following ordinary individuals (L'enfant, 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, The Class, Blue Is the Warmest Colour). To the best of my knowledge, it hasn't really been applied to the realm of the supernatural before; now we see why. This just doesn't work. You can't have a naturalist style with supernatural subplots, real or imagined. Our protagonist can walk into a room and see lights and mist, but she might as well be walking into another movie and quickly stepping out. To make the supernatural feel real, you have to make the film seem unreal- you need that atmosphere, the creepy score, choirs, whispering voices.Without these things, the talk of the supernatural, the spiritualist connection via technology, just doesn't connect. We see our heroine texting with what she thinks might be a spirit, but it doesn't feel like a spirit. Our heroine also explores her sexuality, but the direction doesn't even really let us feel that. I recently re-watched The Mothman Prophecies, which, wile plenty maligned, explored similar concepts, of connecting with the spiritual world via electronics (in that case, it was also phones, but texting wasn't really a thing at the time). That was more effective- it had that atmosphere- the photography, the creepy shots, sounds, and hints. Personal Shopper shuns all of that, and in trying to be more than one thing, succeeds in being very little."
" Two in one
",0.0,0.9159,2017-08-27 00:00:00,7,"It was an interesting concept and Oliver Assayas knows how to put his actors in scene and how to create a beautiful atmosphere. But the films problem was that there were actually two stories in one and that is why it was a little bit over the place. First we have that woman who is looking for contact to her dead twin brother and who is struggling with her own sickness and afraid to have the same fate. Then there is the story of the woman who is obsessed with the life of her employe for whom she is doing all kind of shoppings and who receives mysterious task by a mysterious person who keeps texting her. Although the character is the same, it would have been more effective to make two different movies out of those two different struggles. Kristen Stewart however was brilliant and really saves the film. She delivers her possibly best performance to date. Never though she had it in her in such a high profile. She nailed the role, portrayed it as natural and believable as possible and was able to own every scene with her charismatic and expressional performance. The imaginary was great and so was the soundtrack. Its really a showcase for Stewart tho."

",0.0,0.95,2017-08-04 00:00:00,4,"This film was different. My bad, I did not quite get the title at first. I misunderstood it. I thought it was like a Shopaholic theme, a person with a shopping addiction. Then what I saw was different, and somewhere in the narration it explains what the title meant.The real challenge watching it is the slow moving storyline. Dull and silent on most of the parts. But the mix of fantasy, like supernatural and regular drama brings interesting fact us to stay with it. Though the most of the film was about texting and shopping. I even thought does it any way connected to Stewart's previous film 'Clouds of Sils Maria'. Because there's something where both the films syncs with.Despite being a bit boring film, Kristen Stewart is the reason it is watchable. Her performance was good, but again the mystery about the unexplainable things holds us as well. Definitely a watchable film, but not an entertaining film that you are looking for on a weekend. I'm not sure who is the target audience, but surely less people will think it is a fine film. So I hope you choose it carefully.4/10"

They just don't make them like they used to, amirite? Oh boy, was I unpleasantly surprised. Kristen Stewart is a weird actress.

Strangely oily. Moving on to the myriad of inconsistencies. What is up with the scratched cross? Was it just me that thought it didn't totally resemble a cross? She sketches? What does that have to do with anything? She's a personal shopper? What does that have to do with anything? Why does she act so uncomfortable all the time, like with the German guy?Then, the text messaging. OMFG. Like, she's not even a good texter. It's really annoying to watch her text. Also, what is up with the forbidden theme? That is SO random. It makes NO sense.Then, Kyra's death? I honestly don't get it.Her conversation with Edwin. Wait, he's American too?!?

",-0.3384,-0.9482,2017-07-02 00:00:00,7,"*** spoilers***** This thought-provoking ghost story sent chills down my spine. The beautiful and talented Stewart plays a tortured soul so much better than a vixen (not that you can't be both). She is a medium who has a day job as a personal shopper to a horrible, wealthy, famous woman, who can't even be bothered to reimburse her for her taxi fares. Stewart is also in the throes of grief having just lost her twin brother (who was also a medium). They had a pact that whoever passed on first would make contact with the other. There are so many ghosts in this movie, we are not sure which is her brother. There was even a point at which I wasn't sure they were real or figments of her grief-stricken mind. Viewers may find different opinions on this. But all viewers can agree that grief can be so overwhelming that we may begin to question what is real and what is not. Imagine if you are a medium how much more difficult that could be? Word of note: Do not miss any scenes. Some are brief - especially towards the end - but reveal much. The only reason I didn't rate this higher was the 15 minute scene where she is texting with either her dead brother, herself, or her boss's killer. It was drawn out and not needed. I also didn't care for the artsy-fartsy stuff in the beginning - it could have been left out. But nonetheless, I loved the movie."

I just gave up expecting a complete meaningful story.I liked seeing her ride round in a scooter around Paris and take the Eurostar. Even trying on clothes is quite fun to watch (warning there is some unnecessary nudity).The ghostly goings on are almost comically out of place. As is the sudden darker turn of events.Kristen Stewart looks in turn grungy and glamorous. She is pretty so I wish she wouldn't act and talk in the rushed clipped tomboyish way that reminds of Jodie Foster. She needs to slow down her speech and vary her expressions from sullen to show more a range of emotions.More for K Stew fans.

She is living in Paris because her brother recently died there and she is trying to communicate with him. Both supernatural and psychological, this movie, surprisingly, had me at the edge of my seat.Kristin Stewart was a standout in this film. As much as I don't like her, she is continuing to grow on me every time I see her in something that isn't Twilight. Most of the movie is of her just alone and that is the sense that is given to you. She is alone in Paris trying to deal with the grief and loss of her brother all the while working for a woman she does not like at all. The script is perfect for Kristen and some of her strange acting like being jittery or aloof is perfect for this role as a skeptical medium. There was not a lot of sound used in the film when it comes to a score but when the music plays it really enhances the film. There are also a lot of fade out scenes that is not something you often see but enhanced the mystery of the movie as it seemed like a lot of questions were going unanswered. There is also a lot of texting in the movie between Kristen and an unknown person who at the end of the film will have you wondering who exactly it was. This was brilliant in many regards to show how alone she was and also how much of communication is done over text these days.What I really enjoyed about this movie is while it was very artsy, it was not afraid to get spooky. There are some scenes with ghosts that are very horrifying but are played for the sake of the story and not at all for sight scares. There are only a few ghost scenes as well and by the end of the movie I was clamoring for more but happy that they didn't over stay their welcome.This was a great movie and I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of Kristen Stewart or of mystery movies. It's also a good flick for supernatural fans or fans of mediums, art, and Paris."

But there are not really many dimensions to her acting. This movie is three movies combined (one where she is a personal shopper who hates her boss, one where she communicates with ghosts and one where she has a stalker). No one tell me that the last two are interlinked, unless the ghost was texting her about planning to go to London for the weekend but had to go to a ghost party instead. Any attempted theory to make sense out of this movie massively fails due to various loopholes. You cant really blame it on the audience and say that the scriptwriter and director intentionally left these lacunae to the story. There is a fine line between a half-made (or three half-made) movie(s) and multiple interpretations of a film. In that sense, the movie takes itself too seriously and ends up being pretentious."

The movie starts off that way, and then that story-line just goes straight down the toilet. And the ghost story is next to forgotten about. We then have to endure a large chunk of the film following Kristen Stewart go about her daily business as a personal shopper, picking up fancy clothes for her some rich socialite in Paris. Nothing exciting happens. Then Kristen starts getting stalkerish texts from some unknown person who she thinks may be her deceased brother she is trying to make spiritual contact with. Here we think the ghost story might pick up again. But nope, we quickly realise the stalker is someone else and the story-line goes down the toilet again with a silly sequence of events involving a murder that has no connection at all with the initial premise of the film. When we think this pointless disjointed movie is about to wrap up, we are presented again with some supernatural themes that you want to believe give some sort of purpose to this whole movie and will tie everything together and make you go ""Ohhh! Riiighht"". But nope. The movie ends in a completely anti-climatic state and all you can say is ""What was the point of this?"". I must admit, I started watching it again to see if I was missing something but gave up 1/2 way through as I knew that I was right the first time. I gave it a 4 because the cinematography was it's only saving grace. There was a cool moody vibe to the film but it was wasted on a crappy disjointed story-line that could have been made into something so much better."

It has great moments due to Assayas classy direction which avoids the cheap solutions, the beautiful cinematography and an interesting approach regarding editing. Still, the screenplay has issues and the biggest of them is the metaphysical feature which does not fit successfully to all the other features of the story. Furthermore, the screenplay gets very descriptive while it should be more suggestive.

No intensity, no effort to make this film work, not in the slightest. There is neither escalation, nor something unexpected, as you could expect from a mystery-thriller. Predictable to the last, it completely fails to acquire the desirable and makes the spectator having second thoughts about their choice...Allow me to say though, that Kristen Stewart shows a more ""mature"" acting self, well worked for her character, in a troublesome film that will not be remembered."

" A confusing film that Americans may struggle with
",-0.4939,0.9469,2017-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Here's a question: If you don't understand a film, is that reason enough to hate it? That may be a tougher question than you first perceive it to be. The answer for me would be no - as long as you're certain the film maker had an intention in mind. Stanley Kubrick was famous for this. His films were so intricate and convoluted at times that you could spend weeks studying the film without coming up with anything conclusive. I suspect 'Personal Shopper' is much the same in that regard. I quickly googled ""Personal Shopper explained"" and every web page I went to had incredibly lengthy articles that put forth about 5 different theories, none of which they were the least bit certain made any sense. Needless to say, this is not going to be a film for everyone.I suspect Americans in particular will struggle with this film for two reasons. Firstly, they tend not to like any ambiguity. They like things wrapped up in a nice little package by the end. 'Personal Shopper' most certainly does not do that. Secondly, it could be considered slow. There are very few moments of action in this film and there are quite a few drawn out and wordy scenes (plus a lot of reading of test messages). French films and American films are generally polar opposites in terms of style though, so there's not a lot of surprise there.I'd have to say overall I enjoyed 'Personal Shopper' without ever loving it. I liked the mysteriousness it possessed. You are never entirely certain the direction the film is going to take next. Also there is some great innovation at times. One particular scene where a phone is taken off Flight Mode and a raft of text messages begin to arrive was particularly impressive. Definitely not a film for everyone, however I would suggest you'll know whether you're going to enjoy it or not by about the 15 minute mark."
" Shopping for Belief
",0.0,0.1531,2017-05-17 00:00:00,7,"'Personal Shopper' begins with a young medium called Maureen checking out the country house of her recently deceased twin brother for malevolent spirits. After this opening sequence, she returns to Paris where she works as personal shopper for a spoiled socialite called Kyra. Maureen has the same heart condition which killed her sibling, and despite extra-sensory perception, the loss of her twin has left her with anxiety and weakened faith in an afterlife. Maureen endures humiliation from Kyra and separation from her ex-patriot boyfriend because she believes the city where her brother had died is the most likely location for a visitation from the spirit world. For a while the story proceeds at a leisurely pace with few of the usual melodramas of a ghost story. Tension gathers slowly with a background sense of unease until Maureen starts receiving ominous text messages on her cellphone from an unknown source. This development increases the film's pace and danger, while also pushing it into another genre. 'Personal Shopper' doesn't achieve greatness, but it does deliver a fairly sophisticated narrative, with a nice performance from Kristen Stewart and a satisfyingly ambiguous ending."

I saw half of twilight and hated it, but after seeing Stewart in Still Alice I really liked her acting style. She can make even banal and obvious dialogue realistic and compelling. Even her great acting can't save this movie. The opening scenes are so slow, I thought it MUST develop. It didn't, and I agree with other reviewers who say that the director seems spellbound by Stewarts beauty. The entire movie is just scene after scene of Kristen Stewart skulking around Paris, sexily hating her job and constantly giving her trademark resting-Vogue-cover-model face. There was about 30 mins of Stewart looking sexy/glam/staring intensely that was irrelevant to the plot. I mean, I love a textured and slow burning story but it was too much. This movie was trying to do too many things. The main plot about the ghost went largely unexplored and unexplained, the other stuff was like the acid trip of a Murder She Wrote writer. It starts as a moody drama, turns into an eerie ghost story, makes a left turn and becomes like 25 shades of Gray, then a murder mystery, returns to the scary ghost plot, then sad drama, with a sprinkling of Lost in Translation lonely outsider vibes.

Steward was amazing in this, she was the perfectly chosen actress to play this role. Her transition from being a sort of Tomboyish to a woman with desires is marvelous, and her fear and courage mingled to do things is also well crafted. What bothers me is the missing links and the slow pace of the movie... It is really very long and has some slow scenes that could have made the movie a 90 minutes movie at most. While the character building was taking a long time the action and thrilling scenes came late, they kept us falling for the Spiritual horror movie that ended up to be a weak psychological thriller. I loved the movie while I was watching it ... I liked how we were moving to different capitals in Europe but it failed to make me give it higher than a 6/10. Watch it for it's new idea and Stewart."

This is a fresh, kinda unique story / stories revolving about a young women, who works in Paris as a personal shopper for one famous fashion world star and at the same time she tries to reconnect with her passed away brother (who both are / were mediums). In the mix of this kinda unique set up some thriller / mystery story start and here we have ""Personal Shopper"". Now by saying that this is a fresh movie i mean it in a good way - at running time 1 h 40 min i was intrigued and involved into this movie a lot of. Acting by Kristen Stewart (who's fan i never was) was simply great - this is by fan her best performance i think to date (i haven't saw nor intend to see any of vampire flicks) - this is a true star making performance. Directing, pacing, writing, music all were great.Overall, while i'm afraid ""Personal Shopper"" isn't really for everyone i found this truly unique story superbly told. This movie isn't for mainstream audiences, but those who are looking for some truly unique, fresh and just ""different"" kind of story superbly made and acted - look no further then ""Personal Shopper"" - this is a true gem."

But back to the movie, I feel it had the potential to be great but lacked the execution. Great camera work. However the texting is really annoying. Some aspects really didn't make sense.

" A good original story, with fantastic acting
",0.8316,0.9993,2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Kristen Stewart, a personal shopper for a famous, self-centered model, her twin brother has passed away with whom she'd made a promise to. This promise was that when one of them died, they would try to contact each other from the afterlife.The directing part of this film was quite interesting. The tone he chose for the film went from one to the other whereby it felt like I was watching multiple movies at once, but for some reason it really fitted with the film. Often when a film tries to be a lot, it fails at doing so, here they all just blended in together pretty nicely. And this is because they all lean back to the grief Kristen Stewart is going through at that moment, because that's the main story line, even though it seems like it branches off into something else pretty early on in the film. Visually too this film was pretty good looking. There's one scene in particular that I don't want to spoil which looked really good, with some amazing and creative use of shadow. That scene was also filmed in one take and because the scene went on for quite some time, with some good camera movements it came over as something very impressive. Because of that it was also definitely the stand-out scene of the film. The director also put some items in frame, which can be seen, but mostly by the people who are really paying attention to what's going on on screen and I really like when films reward those who pay attention. Olivier Assayas, the director of the film, did another cool thing, which I really liked. Normally in a mystery film they eventually let you have a shot which kind of gives you the last piece of the puzzle, where after you've solved the mystery. In this movie you don't have that. The film challenges you to think about it, even when the credits have stopped rolling, and you'll need that time to think to understand the film. He leaves a couple of questions unanswered at the end of the film, but after thinking about it, they'll start to make sense. Olivier Assayas was also pretty good at setting up tense/scary scenes of which there are a couple in the film, but not enough to call it a horror film, which a lot of people suspected it would be: just your average ghost film, but it's much more than that. But after something positive, something negative has to follow, namely that I didn't really like the editing. The continuous fading to black for example felt really out of place and seemed to only be there to let you know that you're watching an art house film. And there are a lot of transactions like that. The choppy editing at times also interfered with the smooth flow of the film, which is a shame. But at times the editing also worked in a good way, like when Kristen Stewart is texting with the unknown person, but more on that later.Another thing that managed to capture the feel of grief was the acting and I am talking of course about the absolutely fantastic acting of Kristen Stewart. Stewart is mostly known for her awful role in the Twilight series, in which she plays a basically emotionless human being. After that role, though, she's gone on to choose better projects in which she got her time to shine. This film was one of them. Really, she's one of the main reasons why you should watch this film, I was blown away by her performance and as the film progressed, she seemed to get better and better, because the movie challenged her more to portray this multi-layered and complex character as she went through more things that shape someone. Stewart was able to become her character and gave the best performance I've seen of her. The supporting cast was lesser good, at times even bad, but Stewart totally makes up for this and the supporting cast also isn't seen a lot in the film, so this really wasn't a big problem.The screenplay was pretty good and contained an interesting and unpredictable story, which was engaging as well. If it wasn't clear from the part where I praised Kristen Stewart for her acting; the characters were good as well. The side characters were relatively flat, but Kristen Stewart's was really well developed. That's because she's obviously the protagonist, but also because the writer wanted to show her loneliness in this world after the death of her brother, which is also a subplot that's briefly discussed at times, or not necessarily discussed, but it is at least something that you can find in the subtext of certain scenes. (the loneliness, not the death of her brother, that's brought up numerous times) I liked what they did via the medium of text messages and brought a certain sense of mystery to the film. These scenes were all very interesting to follow, which is quite weird, since we often only looked at a phone screen and Kristen Stewarts acting for around ten minutes. But the well directing, tense score and well editing, at those times, helped to create an intriguing but vague sequence at times. This was a very original and cool thing that helped to make the film different from anything else you can go see in theaters. In the end ""Personal Shopper"" was a very good film, with some amazing acting from Kristen Stewart and some fantastic directing from Olivier Assayas, who also created an interesting, weird and original story which was also unpredictable. He made a movie-mash up of different themes which blended together nicely, because of the main theme: grief. That's why this film gets an 8.1/10"
" A quality French Thriller

Some scenes were too long and never ending whilst others blunt and flinching. I can honestly say this is the first time I've actually enjoyed watching Kristen Stewart. She delivered an unflattering portrayal of the subject. And she made shopping almost feel like a aphrodisiac. The movie felt real."

Well at least I can't, how much I try, there is absolutely nothing positive that comes into my mind about this movie. The story is very slow and overly boring. You have to be a huge fan of Kristen Stewart to appreciate this movie. I wasn't before and I'm certainly not now. She looks depressed all the time, for no good reason at all. Her facial expressions are just not what you expect from a good actress. In these modern ages all you see now are people texting or doing something with their stupid phones. Everybody becomes very boring because of their phones. So if I already have to watch those boring people in real life I certainly don't want to do that when I watch a movie to relax. And that's what you get for a long time in Personal Shopper, Kristen Stewart texting like she's still a teenager. And that goes on and on. I have to admit I fought against sleep and at one point I lost. When I woke up I didn't feel the urge of rewinding to the point where I closed my eyes. Because I couldn't care less anymore about Kristen Stewart texting."

",0.0,0.7255,2017-04-24 00:00:00,7,"The sophomore collaboration between Olivier Assayas and Kristen Stewart after CLOUDS OF SIL MARIA (2014), in PERSONAL SHOPPER, the latter is elevated to the sole leading status, plays an American girl Maureen in Paris, she is the titular personal shopper of Kyra (Waldstätten), a well- minted celebrity figure. It is a dream job for fashion-and-ego oriented girls who cannot afford the luxury but are vouchsafed to luxuriate in it as a surrogate shopper (and get well paid), by dint of high-end dress sense. But, Stewart, who emanates a distinctly counter-consumerism flair in her androgynous mien and dress-down spontaneity, takes the offer with defiant nonchalance, because Maureen hates it, not only because Kyra is an impersonal monster, but in a more personal note, she is repelled by the nature of her vocation. A theme being predictably provoked when she is abetted by eponymous messages sent to her cellphone: Does she want to become a different person? Simply by donning those haute couture (a conspicuously vain idea of identity shifting), Maureen is tempted, tried, but eventually she thinks better of it. So, the glamorous job is merely to defray her rent, the main reason of Maureen's drawn-out sojourn in Paris is a highly psychic one, she shares the same congenital heart problem with her twin brother Lewis, who passed away several months ago here, professing both are endowed with a medium's made-up, and a promise to contact each other from beyond whoever dies first, she is waiting, seeking, for a sign, a signal (from Lewis) and a closure (for herself), and the wait extends while many parapsychic phenomena transpire around an increasingly jittery Maureen, including the said messages, are they from Lewis, or has she been driven to such a state that she would like to will herself to believe they are from Lewis? In due course, she would be implicated in a grisly murder, and eventually (spoilers alert), the story is puckishly topped of with yawning evasion, in the middle-east Oman, but the revelation somewhat leaves some splashes to impel viewers to examine inwardly the notion of ghost and spirit, preferably with an idealistic methodology, not dissimilar with the mystic vanishing of Stewart's character in CoSM. Spiritualism's correlation with technology is a scintillating proposition Assayas assuredly propounds but seems to fumble for a clear answer, instead he dishes out Hilma af Kint's abstract art and Victor Hugo's séance video-clip (from a fictitious TV movie) to (nominally) ginger up the intrigue, insofar as he even confects gimmicks from horror genre, a visible ghost disgorging ectoplasm, or a blink-and-you-will-miss-it apparition materializes itself in the background during an overtly extended long take focusing on Maureen. Those moments, may contradict Assayas' preordained tack of straddling the issue, but are effective attention-stealers one might think Assayas wouldn't deign to conduct at any rate, we all love surprises, don't we? Still, PERSONAL SHOPPER is an empath's self-reliant rite-of-passage to bring down the curtain on a bereavement, on top of which Assayas grafts his sortie in psychological horror, affixed with a tangy criticism towards the glitter and vacuousness of consumerism, not a bad combo at all, if, you are not galled by an open-ended denouement staring squarely at your face."

Maureen follows her brother request and travels to an Arabic country (i believe it was Oman, but am not sure) and the spirit visits her again there. spirit once visited her in her sisters house by breaking a glass of water, but Maureen is not easy to get convinced about evidences and totally ignored that. this time spirit breaks another glass, then start to make noise by closing the wooden door/window, but still Maureen is not convinced if that is the brother ( are you Luis?), but even if it was the brother, he does not sound nice at all! moral conclusion might be: don't try to contact spirits unless you know the exact number. you might call wrong number and find an angry spirit following you around! Movie was bit slow and confusing, but well you could see lot of tits! ending is also open and you can not say for sure if: she met brothers spirit, if ex-bf was the murderer, if Maureen is satisfied now and can go after her life which is shopping for another celebrity i assume!"

Then there are these long scenes where she texts with a stranger, who is either a ghost or isn't, but either way they'e very boring.

Director Olivier Assayas managed to create a film that is so sure of itself it defies all genres, conventions, and expectations. He found a perfect balance between not caring what the audience thinks about his movie without alienating or insulting his audience with how much he doesn't care. No emotional manipulation or trying to cater to/please the widest possible audience here, which is so very refreshing. This is what he has to say. Take it or leave it. Love it or hate it. So, while it is not the best movie I have ever seen and has it's flaws, I am still giving it a very high rating for daring to be different. On a side note, taste in movies is extremely subjective, so I can understand and respect the reasons why other reviewers gave this movie such low ratings. However, I do not agree with the common practice of putting down other reviewers/calling them idiots for having different opinions. In a perfect world, I wish we could all just agree to disagree without being hateful/hurtful. Peace."
" Confusing and slow
",-0.2263,-0.641,2017-04-21 00:00:00,4,"The movie, ""Personal Shopper,"" was recommended to me on some site, and the supernatural part of the plot sounded interesting. I got through it, but it was not pleasant. The story was convoluted, slow, and ended before explaining anything. It was like reading a second graders story, but only if you forced the second grader to write an entire manuscript; so many of things thrown in there that you thought they would eventually tie together somehow, then it simply ended... With a song that makes it seem like everything worked out.Oh! And as the movie name describes, Kirsten is a Personal Shopper. Oddly enough though she is dressed almost like she's camping for the entire movie. Going to Cartier, Chanel, and clients homes with greasy hair and a T-shirt. So odd. Don't watch this unless you like being bored and frustrated."
" I mean, come on.
",0.0,-0.4556,2017-04-21 00:00:00,5,"Another movie where Kristen Stewart plays Kristen Stewart. I mean, come on; the gal can't act to save her life and yet everyone seems to be oblivious to the fact. The script is bad. Some lines are downright ridiculous, and the screenwriter seems to have been blind to the thin line between intriguing unanswered questions and plot holes. If you are willing to fill in the gaps with your imagination, though, and you don't mind the excruciatingly slow pace, you may enjoy the movie."
" We've all been through that rut...
",0.0,0.9676,2017-04-20 00:00:00,7,"Starring Kristen Stewart as Maureen Cartwright, a woman who holds the titular occupation, Personal Shopper is a mishmash of genres and ideas that culminate in a self-discovery story, and a fairly good one at that.Maureen is a personal shopper inasmuch as I am a supermarket employee. (I'm that, sure, but more importantly, I'm a writer.) It's what she does, but she's determined not to let it define her. She's also a medium, and has desires to be something more. She doesn't seem to know what she wants to be, but it's heavily implied that she'd be much happier buying overpriced clothes and jewellery for herself rather than for her clients. Maureen is also using her skills as a medium to try and find a sign from her dead twin brother, Lewis. Lewis was also a medium, and had a pact with Maureen that the first of them to die would send a sign to the other – a promise that both expected to be able to keep fairly promptly, as they both had the same heart deformation, and it was this that killed Lewis.In a lot of ways, this plays into the desperation we see Maureen spiral into throughout the film. Although we don't see anything of her relationship with Lewis – he's been dead approximately two years – it would be understandable for them to go through life not knowing how much time they've got, but human nature still dictates that you expect to make it through the day and wake up tomorrow. Lewis' death would have changed that outlook for Maureen. She's now had it hammered home that her death could come at any moment. But without Lewis around, she doesn't have anyone she can talk to about it. She could talk to her doctor, or go to some kind of therapy, but for whatever reason, she's chosen not to. Instead, she interacts primarily with her clients and other people she meets through work. So when she starts receiving anonymous text messages, she replies to them in a way that any sane and rational person would. She doesn't know who this person is, which means she can't form a real emotional attachment to them, and to Maureen, that means she can talk to them the way she can't talk to anyone else.Personal Shopper is a journey of self-discovery for Maureen, and as such, Stewart is in every scene. At first, director Olivier Assayas seems determined to keep her face in the shadows – the movie opens with Maureen arriving at a darkened old house, and she spends the next five minutes exploring it, seemingly in the search for spirits – but as events unfold, Maureen is more and more exposed. That's symbolised in a later scene where Maureen changes clothes, and goes nearly nude in the process (stripping down to just her panties before getting dressed again). There's also an earlier scene where she's topless as she has an ultrasound. Contextually, both of these scenes make sense for Maureen to be in some state of undress. Neither scene is sexually explicit, and a later scene that has sexual implications to it is done in a tasteful way that serves the story and character arc.Unfortunately, Kristen Stewart doesn't quite have the acting chops to carry a movie like this yet. She's very good, and in some scenes, she's spectacular, but a role like this really requires someone who can truly lose themselves in it. At many points throughout the movie, I actually felt like I was watching Maureen, rather than watching Stewart act. That's fantastic, it's what the role called for, but the moments where Stewart fumbled were all the more noticeable because of it. Stewart's been getting a lot of praise over the last few years, and Personal Shopper makes it clear why. It's a great showcase for the potential she has, and I have no doubt she could carry a movie like this in a few years' time. She's just not quite there yet.She's also not helped by the fact that no-one in the supporting case particularly stands out. Kyra (Nora von Waldstätten), Maureen's main employer, was the worst of the bunch. At one point, she's sitting on her bed taking a conference call, and wouldn't stop squirming around. It was like she couldn't get comfortable, and I have no idea what she was trying to portray. It distracted from whatever the scene was trying to tell us, and this was really von Waldstätten's only chance to show us what a horrible boss Kyra supposedly was.The most interesting person Maureen interacts with is her text message stalker, and this part of the movie's story also gives us a great thriller / mystery element. One scene where you think the stalker's identity is about to be revealed is beautifully built up with drama and tension, underscored by some truly frightful music. The main point Personal Shopper is getting at is that we all go through a time in life that we consider a rut. You know those times where you're stuck in a job or relationship that just doesn't do anything for you anymore, but you don't know how to get out of it or what you'd do without it. Staying in the rut provides a form and sense of security, and all too often we value that security over whatever might happen if we moved on.For my full review of this and other movies, visit my website at theblogfather.co.nz"
" A film about Kristen Stewart texting iMessages on an iPhone.
",0.0,0.7062,2017-04-19 00:00:00,4,"If you would LOVE to watch Kristen Stewart spend an entire film sending and receiving boring anonymous text messages (which have zero relativity to the plot and character development), then boy ahoy you are in for a real treat here!I can't bring myself to waste much time on writing a review for this. The biggest takeaway from this film is that Kristen Stewart sends and receives a lot of text messages with an anonymous person on the other end. That's it. There's really nothing else in this film. It's not scary, it's not mysterious, it's not adventurous, it's not thrilling, it's not dramatic, it's nothing.Hopefully this helps you make your decision if you're considering whether to watch or not to watch."
" A well-acted but unoriginal iPhone-driven ghost story
",-0.4497,-0.9967,2017-04-19 00:00:00,6,"Ambiguity in storytelling is a double-edged sword: it can mask a narrative that is unsure of itself or it can be a source of visual pleasure. It is used to some extent in all good filmmaking, offering imaginative pathways for viewers to bring their own interpretations to the story. But over-reliance on ambiguity is risky. The supernatural film Personal Shopper (2016) elevates ambiguity to an overarching theme. The film offers few clues on whether the story is about a grieving sister's personal journey into the spirit world or her grief trauma psychosis or her encounters with real ghosts.The plot hinges on a brother and sister pact that whoever dies first from their shared congenital heart condition will contact the other from the next world. It is months since her brother died, and Maureen (Kristen Stewart) is still waiting for a sign that he is at peace. Her continued emotional pain and closeness to him is palpable and she is suppressing grief trauma just enough to function. She lives in a world of shadows, both as a personal shopper for a mega-celebrity and as a spiritual medium awaiting contact with the dead. When she starts receiving unidentified text messages that appear to know too much about her, she is unsure if it is her brother or a stalker. There is unmistakable eroticism in how she reacts to the texts and in her relationship with the demanding celebrity. The texts become domineering and lead the story into unpredictable and weird territory.Audiences hoping to witness genuine contact with a departed soul will be disappointed. In its place, they will find a disjointed montage of outer-worldly and mortally sinister possibilities that rely on the viewer joining the dots. Despite the marketing hype, this film lacks originality and narrative coherence. There is an abundance of tired ghostly tropes like floating translucent veils, self- levitating glasses, and a haunted house with creaking floorboards to make sure we know it's a ghost story. Maureen's job as a personal shopper is a narrative construction to reveal her fetish in dressing up and even masturbating in outrageously expensive clothes. Unless you are a voyeur for people's private conversations, the prolonged sequences of iPhone texting from an unknown source can become tiresome. The cinematography is classically supernatural: dark, dark, and then darker scenes with some illuminated only by the whites of Kristen's eyes. The main redeeming feature of this film is Kristen Stewart herself. Whether the script is convincing or otherwise, she has the talent to carry the role in all its mercurial variations, from the fast-talking fashionista, to terrified victim, to the sister poignantly mourning the loss of her beloved brother.In an increasingly secular world, fans of this genre will keep searching for original, plausible, and scary supernatural films that explore the existence of an afterlife. After all, the genre itself exists to give vicarious expression to our fear of death. In one way, Personal Shopper makes a fresh contribution to the genre with its depiction of iPhone technology as the new séance platform for communicating with the unknown. But the film also falls back on old genre standbys like chatting to a ghost via the slamming of doors. Overall, it has enough eerie atmosphere, dramatic tension and unexpected twists to be entertaining, but it is Kirsten Stewart alone who saves it from mediocrity."
" Truly awful
",-0.0258,-0.7263,2017-04-19 00:00:00,4,"We saw this last week and after an hour or so people began to leave. As the titles came up at the end, the woman behind me shouted For f%$£ sake.The basis of the story is weak and revolves entirely around KS seeking a sign from her recently departed brother that there was an afterlife. He was a medium, she is a medium and their near the end friend we find out is a medium. All mediums together. Who here doesn't know at least 3 mediums? There is an attempt to add a story to this drab concoction involving the theft of jewels with starts and finished with quick predictability and seems to have been added to alter the mind numbing acting of KS and her shopping/buying scenes.The end must rank as the worst endings leading from a dull storyline to the Far East (yawn!) 90 minutes I'll never get back"

Then...nothing happens, except for some boring and pretentious plot filler that drones on and on until the final twist...which is a resounding meh because it surprises no one and has been done before in much better movies. Don't bother watching unless you really like Kristen Stewart. If you're a fan, you get to see her topless, which I guess is enough for some people."
" Quietly creeping, unsettling film about spirits
",0.0,0.7391,2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"This taut, low-key mystery thriller proves to be quite unnerving and if you let it, it will become a source of self-debate afterward. It centers around another stark performance by Kristen Stewart, who in her own squirmy but brooding way fits the role perfectly as a European celebrity's personal shopper in Paris who confronts the possibility of spirits in the aftermath of family loss.Stewart's role is fairly similar to the one she had in her previous collaboration with director Assayas, though here the plot deals predominantly with grief and the supernatural rather than pop culture and entertainment; here, Stewart's character's fancy job and the industry she works in become something of an afterthought. The posh surroundings are all but forgotten amid the creepy mood that pervades.The film's biggest problem is not the much-maligned logic gaps, but rather a pacing that is too uneven. The editing here is a bit choppy at times. But the film's tempo and pitch are able to overcome these missteps with an emotional buildup that burrows into the main character's anxieties, uncertainties and ongoing quandaries.You will either find this gripping or ridiculous. But the film gets a lot of points for being both creative and well-executed with the kind of modest but effective style we see too rarely deployed in contemporary cinema. Gladly recommended."
" Unfortunately Stale.
",-0.34,0.9703,2017-04-17 00:00:00,5,"For who this film would legitimately satisfy as a whole is a bigger question than the ones most people will have after viewing. The previous sentence is almost as confusing as how this is getting rave reviews. Perhaps it's those who overlooked the many flaws because they enjoy the director or actors. Kristen Stewart definitely has found her way into some great parts that will surprise those who only are only familiar with the Twilight series. Kudos to her for that and I look forward to many more great performances. It's the story that didn't pay off for me, especially after an interesting trailer. Some will call it pretentious and boring. As someone who usually loves movies that get called those things, I find it hard to argue unfortunately."

It fails as a mystery, as a drama, as a thriller, and as a horror. It simply fails. Period. It is a pretentious piece of turd trying to disguise itself as art. But it stinks too much to disguise itself as anything but the pile of crap it is."

Or Ingo (and wanted to made Maureen murderer)?3. What does it means in Dubai ""Louis is that you or it just me""-- ""(single signal)""? Is it means everything is just happened inside Maureen's head, and she murdered Kyra for her jewelries and later on Louis (her other identity or virtual character) told her to go to hotel and left all jewelries at room 329 to get rid of this murder.Finally, ""WOW"" with the ""Art"" of this film. Kristen Stewart was natural, actually personality of Maureen and KS is all same, so she was just perfect for this character.I love this film."
" Pretentious, drawn out and overly dramatic. Not a good film.
",-0.3412,-0.9354,2017-04-15 00:00:00,2,"I watched this movie, knowing very little about it beforehand, and I was left baffled by how anyone could make such an interesting premise result in such a mundane and tedious film. Nothing goes on for most of the movie, and when I mean NOTHING, I mean nothing. We get overly long shots of Stewart riding her Moped, shopping for clothes, dealing with her ""friends"", and smoking. So much damn smoking. When things do happen, it is poorly executed and reminiscent of a film students first project. The film does not know what it wants to be; a horror movie, a ghost story, a murder mystery, a drama, an art film. It tries to be an amalgam of all of these genres and fails handsomely at every single one. I just don't understand how this can happen. The director is competent, the script was serviceable if a bit simplistic, and the acting was not awful. How can these elements which would work in any other movie fail so incredibly in this one? One scene in particular stood out to me that describes this entire movie; Stewart's character is on a train on her way to London from France. She is receiving text messages from an unknown sender, and the exchange goes on for like 10 minutes. She moves from cart to cart, exchanging high school level texts messages with someone she does not know, and this goes on for 10 whole minutes. Who really wants to see 10 minutes of someone text messaging? It's poor film making, using technology to excuse a lack of creativity. It's the worst type of film making, and while this film is not awful, it really does not deserve to be seen by anyone. It is just not worth it."
" Arsty Fartsy Ghosts
",0.0,-0.8849,2017-04-15 00:00:00,1,"Well, it seems that the director of this movie specifically made it with one noble thing in mind. And no, it was not to discuss the after-life, depression, loneliness, grief, etc.It was made with the sole objective to show again to the audiences a topless Kristen Stewart!!! Which is OK per se (she is not that bad), but not enough to fill the interest of the audience for more than the time her exposed nipples are shown on the screen.Other than that, the story is tedious, Kristen Stewart is irritating in her role (as usual, she cannot act!), characters are boring and dry, nothing scary happens, the alleged ghosts are juvenile and, of course, the film has no resolution at all (it is an artsy-fartsy film, right?). The director simply decides to leave everything hanging in the air like....the ghost of a bad idea!Unless you have a devotion for Stewart's nipples, there nothing much in it."
" So Boring
",-0.3804,-0.8439,2017-04-14 00:00:00,1,"I was looking forward to watching another Kristen Stewart film that looked so good from the trailer. How wrong was I? The run-down cinema in Sheffield had a few problems so there were no trailers or adverts at the beginning, meaning we were straight into the film after ten minutes of apologising by the embarrassed staff.Get on with it I hear you cry! I have to write 1000 characters for this review so that's why I'm waffling..The film started off slowly.. very slowly. I remember checking my watch around twenty five minutes then I don't remember a thing. Yes, for the first time ever in a cinema I fell asleep!After an hour or so I woke to a nudge from behind because I was snoring. I watched for another fifteen minutes but it was so mind-numbingly boring I left the cinema and returned to my hotel room."

She also happens to be a medium that know how to communicate with spirits from the other world and refuses to leave Paris until she gets a sign from her recently departed brother Louis.""Personal Shopper"" is one endeavor in genre mix I had yet to see. The fusion of styles, ideas and cinematic traditions is fascinating and quite off putting at the start, yet it manages to entertain audiences with moments of true suspense and fascination even though it goes completely off the rails in trying to have any emotional impact or pay off.The film is a mixing of genre as much as it is a mixing of styles. We get these long uninterrupted shots that stalk Maureen through the house which she believes she is haunted and juxtaposes it to scenes that you would expect to find in a dark fashion thriller. This combination admittedly does give the film an inherent interest that never leaves it. The first hour or so of the movie is quite captivating in how unapologetically it brings together these various elements lacing them together with a quite arrogant use of jump cuts which result in a smart idea to link the fantastic with the mundane.Kristen Stewart is a very effective lead, she manages to paint layers of characterization onto this person and open up an emotional place that would have easily been lost in hands of lesser actors. Her work is probably why the suspense scenes work so well. It is amazing to see how in one moment you are following a fashion discussion and you're captivated by it and in the next one you're completely scared by an apparent ghost story. Assayas definitely has to get some credit for the structure in which the horror scenes are built, whilst he has some major problems in tackling the genre, the scenes of suspense work perfectly because of a true mastery on the technical aspect. The elements introduced are synthetic and effective and they are juggled around in a perfect attempt at audience manipulation. Moreover he manages to get a couple of really amazing and suspenseful stable shots that I won't spoil, but really stick out as gems of the technical proficiency of the film.Unfortunately there are many story points and and emotional beats of the film that have almost no context or relevance to character here. Assayas has many problems in building the supernatural and there is lots that is either left for blatant exposition or not explained at all and left in a weird place of misunderstanding. The closure of the picture suffers immensely from this and all of the fancy genre stuff does not come together in an ending that leaves the audience completely cold and clueless on what emotions to feel. Overall the film has some very brave ideas and motifs, but the intention behind it leaves the audience scratching their head."
" a different definition for 'Ghosting' (aka ""Ghost-Text: The Movie"")
",0.0,0.9944,2017-04-02 00:00:00,8,"A movie I didn't think I would contemplate while watching Personal Shopper came to me, and it made me appreciate Assayas's work all the more: Unfriended. Anyone remember that piece of trash? I know not all felt the way I did, but Unfriended represented, for my money, a completely impoverished sense of making material cinematic; that film, if you may recall, was kind of a Skype-found footage horror movie where one saw the action take place in real time on a computer screen with sometimes video of people looking at their computers screens/web-cams, but mostly it was seeing lots and lots and lots of text being typed and exchanged (and, as something else that made me think of it, it's a spirit from beyond the grave who is giving back to the teenagers and bullies).What bothered me when I saw that (aside from a roster of horrible actors, characters and clichés from slashers and found footage), was that there was nothing redeeming the material through the power of cinematic grammar. That may sound a little much to expect, but if one is trying to use modern technology to make a unique spin on a genre experience, then it should have something new to offer our eyes and senses as part of the mis-en-scene, pacing and other facets of filmmaking. What makes Personal Shopper stand out as a much stronger example of what Unfriended died and failed to do was that Assayas is using technology through much of the film - text messages make up a good 50% of the screen-time here, if not more - but he also has two assets as a filmmaker: first, his lead and possible muse Kristen Stewart, who is there to react to the texts and is an active agent engaging with whoever this 'Unknown' is who about 35/40 minutes into the movie starts messaging her and making her feel alienated and distressed, and secondly that he builds suspense and finds realistic moments to take a break in the action of the texts.That is to say, she may be on a train, for example, and messaging with this 'Unknown', and then she has to get off the train or find somewhere else, or there's the trepidation or suspense if she'll actually message back to a message that seems very creepy or suspicious or to increase her paranoia and so on. It's one of the few times that I can think of that a filmmaker has made something that is now practically ubiquitous to the lives of those with smartphones (that is, everyone in the modern world), and yet it's a useful device for tension and drama and conflict for our heroine. The other positive is that it's not all that this movie has up its sleeve; on the contrary, this is a ghost story, but it's really Assayas taking the ghost story as a vehicle not so much for horror (though there are some scenes that may make people jump if they're especially prone to things that 'apparition' in front or behind someone, and a particularly brutal murder), but for an existential sort of inquiry: if there are ghosts and an after-life, shouldn't that be slightly optimistic, that there is some after-life to look out for? What's so strong though is Assayas filming everything with a keen sense of creating suspense when he has to, but also creating a mood for his star to become equal parts vulnerable, strong, confused, sexually aroused (yeah, that kind of happens at one point, thanks to a dress with early 20th century Germanic overtones due to the black leather straps), and searching and questioning as a performer. And it's Stewart herself, who's occasional (or often) trembling and nervous quality serves Maureen really well at times - notice the close-ups of her shaking thumbs - and yet there's a lot of depth here that may be easy to miss that she brings to this character. She has to hold our attention, and at first I wondered if she could (she's in practically every scene - there's one where I thought, maybe, she's an invisible spirit herself?) and she does. She's attractive and yet, as someone I was with pointed out to me after the movie ended, it's a 'Tablua Rasa' sort of thing too: we can project how we feel about her reactions, to the texts, to the people she's around and a little separate from (mostly the rich people she shops personally for, hence the title), and also on the film itself.Is it all a blank slate? Yes and no, and that's what keeps the intrigue for me. Though by the very end, I was hoping for a little more clarity than what I got - some may not feel that way, and there's certainly an emotional undercurrent to that last shot that can be felt greatly. But I wish it hadn't been SO ambiguous; it leaves what is a pretty good, sometimes marvelous and alluring and daring dramatic thriller, in the space of what could have been a masterwork. But, hey, texts are now interesting on a cinematic level, so major ups to Assayas for making that leap."
" Watch it for the stellar performance from Kristen Stewart
",0.0,0.9975,2017-04-01 00:00:00,7,"""Personal Shopper"" (2016 release from France; 108 min.) brings the story of Maureen. As the movie opens, Maureen is being dropped off at a house on the outskirts of Paris. Maureen spends the night hoping to connect with ""the next world"" but nothing happens. Only later do we realize that she is trying to connect with Lewis, her recently deceased twin brother who died in that house from a heart attack. The person who had dropped her off was Lara, who was Lewis' girlfriend. After the opening scenes, we get to know Maureen better: she is a personal shopper for Kyra, a super-busy and well off model, for whom Maureen picks up clothes and jewelry. Maureen has come to Paris after Lewis' death, as Lewis was a medium who believed in the spiritual world. Lewis and Maureen, who suffers from the same heart deformation as Lewis, made a pact that whoever dies first will send a signal to the other from the next world. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie marks the reunion of French writer-director Olivier Assayas and Kristen Stewart, who previously made the critically well-received ""Clouds of Sils Maria"". Here they go a very different direction, namely how a surviving twin must learn to go on in life, even while yearning for her twin brother. This movie is nothing short of a tour de force for Stewart, who appears in virtually every from of the movie, I read somewhere that Assayas wrote the role of Maureen specifically with Stewart in mind, and Stewart certainly returns the favor by bringing one of her very best performance to date yet. The days of ""Twilight"" long beyond her, Stewart, still only 26 if you can believe it, continues to surprise (in the best possible way) with her choice of roles (check also: the recent and excellent ""Certain Women"", Anesthesia, the already mentioned Clouds of Sils Maria, and One the Road a few years ago). So far for the good news. For the not quite as good news: the plot requires you to take certain leaps of faith, and to be honest, I couldn't quite get there. So for all the buzz about this being a ""psychological thriller"", I found that a bit of a stretch. Instead I found myself fully mesmerized just watching Stewart's performance. There is a long sequence in the movie where Stewart is on the EuroStar to London and she finds herself texting with an ""Unknown"" number... Just watch! ""Personal Shopper"" premiered at least year's Cannes Film Festival, to great acclaim and with Assayas winning the ""Best Director"" award. The movie finally opened this weekend on 2 screens here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (5 people, including myself, of which 2 left about midway through and didn't return). If you are expecting to see a 'scary' movie, you are sure to be disappointed. In instead you are in the mood for a character study about a grieving surviving twin that includes a stellar performance from Kristen Stewart, you are in for a treat, and I'd encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
" No, the film does not revolve around fashion, rather it's around the supernatural and stories of ghosts.
",-0.296,0.9824,2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Choosing a person's wardrobe is a bit like playing the doll for an adult isn't it? (Without getting sick, otherwise it will be like playing the doctor).Off-Note: Two years after Sils Maria, her César win, Kristen Stewart again teamed up with French director Olivier Assayas for 'Personal Shopper,' which is truly a fantastic drama! Or I'm just build in a way where Beautiful Women and dramatic senses of Fashion can trigger one hell of a yearning inside. More or less.Maureen, played by Stewart, is a personal shopper for a high-end model in France. She's not in love with her job, she's working her way through art classes, and she's struggling with the same disease that recently took her brother's life. She's in mourning over her brother, but she also seems to be able to communicate with spirits and is constantly looking for signs that he is at peace. On top of all of that, she seems to have acquired a stalker who is making demands that may or may not give her safe ideas.If you couldn't tell by the synopsis, this movie is a combination of many, many different styles, tones, and events. It shifts back, forth, left, right, up, down, northwest, southwest, and any other way you could possibly think of, and it does so in the best way possible. My favourite thing about the film is its pure originality, unpredictability, and refusal to reveal its secrets. Just three months into the year, I haven't seen a single movie that has kept me locked in and captivated simply by deciding not to reveal anything. I felt like Personal Shopper rewired my brain to actually think about the film as compared to waiting for the story to unfold before my eyes and have everything explained to me. It doesn't do that, and I have to admire how bold that decision is. Next, as many tone shifts, story shifts, and general shifts as there are in Personal Shopper, somehow it all comes together much more cohesively than you might expect. Ordinarily you might see a movie that puts so many moving pieces together and decide that it never pulls together as one. Personal Shopper uses its ambiguity, mystery and frantic to come together as one fascinating and riveting thriller that kept my heart beating the entire time. It's beautifully directed and edited, and the story actually has a lot to say about what it means to lose a family member. The best examples of this come in scenes in which Stewart is texting her stalker, and you can see the stress that it puts her under. She has no idea who she's texting, and the possibility of sending the wrong thing, the possibility of who is on the other end, and the idea that the person on the other end knows so much about her makes her extremely nervous and vulnerable, and we learn so much about her character through these scenes. Kristen Stewart also blew me away in this role. This might be the best I've seen from her in her entire career, and she pulled off the stress of her situation and the grief of losing a family member.I'm hard-pressed to find something I didn't like in the movie just because every time it went in an odd direction or did something weird, I was so intrigued by the way it avoided mainstream norms. Like I said earlier, it would have been very easy to have a misstep in all of the changes in tone and story, and it would have been easy to have a flimsy structure and not be able to decide what it actually wants to be. A lot of the changes worked for me, and so many different tones worked and became cohesive. My one thing that I could find that didn't at least compel me was a bit of the beginning. It took a second for me to fully jump in and accept a lot of what this movie shows. It felt a little bit dry, but it definitely picked up once I realised what the film was going for.Overall, Personal Shopper is possibly the most intriguing movie of the year, and it's so fascinating because it refuses to tell us its secrets. It's probably the most captivating film I've seen in 2017, and the constant tone changes and frantic of the shifts make it extremely original and unpredictable. It's very well-directed and edited, and the story has a lot to say about how people react and the tension that grows after losing someone you're close to and beginning to part with your better judgement. It's visually interesting and the story is so enthralling and different. If you go into this movie expecting a supernatural horror-thriller, you'll be severely disappointed. In fact, you're going to have to open your mind to many different genres and go in with zero expectations. I'd absolutely suggest seeing it, but leave every genre expectation at the door. I'm going to give Personal Shopper an 8/10."
" Beyond Bad!!!
",-0.6571,-0.7169,2017-03-29 00:00:00,1,"I saw an advanced screening of this movie. It kept changing genres without really delving into any of them. Many scenes didn't even make sense at all. There are a few mentions that Stewart is a medium but she states that she doesn't even know if she believes in an after life. What??? She never successfully communicates with spirits. Scenes are disjointed and don't seem to have anything to do with the others. When the movie ended everyone in the theater just looked at each other and sat there bewildered. If I had paid for it, I would ask for my money back. If you do want to see it, wait for it on DVD."

They at least chose a good actress for the lead, but the film was a downer from the beginning and progressively got worst until I had to leave. What might have been a good concept on paper failed on the screen. Kristen's portrayal of the character was uninteresting to me from the beginning and the cliché use of cigarettes and toothpicks were unnecessary. If I am checking Facebook in the middle of a movie it must be bad."
" Not a medium... but a mentalist
",0.0,0.9299,2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"I have another meaning to the movie:She has control over other's minds, not as a medium, but more as a mentalist. In that line, she ""hypnotizes"" people, even herself and makes things happen, like water running or noises. She is not aware of that ability, so she makes it from an unconscious level. She starts receiving messages from Ingo and through the dynamics they set up, she ends up making him take the guilt of killing Kyra, but she did it. She did the whole thing - she just manipulates everything and everyone without knowing it... she might be a bit aware of all of it in the final scene though! OK - Maybe this complexity is more a projection of myself, but sometimes I make up stories, or movies or get into actresses minds to prove a point ;) Sincerely,
Your Personal Shopper :)"
" Spiritualism
",0.0,0.8692,2017-03-25 00:00:00,7,"This film just opened in Toronto and I was anxious to see it. I found the historical references fascinating. During the early 1900s, spiritualism was all the rage in various circles, especially among scientists. As an electrical engineer, I was surprised to learn that the inventor of PCM pulse code modulation, the basis of all the digital world, was Alec Harley Reeves. He was trying to discover a method to communicate with this dead mother. What I most enjoyed about the film was the immediacy. It was almost like I was not watching the movie but I was part of it. Sort of like that scene in the park in ""Blow-Up"" where the whole world stops. The shots of Kristen Stewart are amazing, almost portrait like. She certainly builds the tension throughout the film, tremendous acting."
" slow but absorbingly good.
",0.5927,0.9386,2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Personal Shopper is very French.It has the languid pace of the French New Wave, letting the movie breathe gently as its story of loss and identity gradually unfolds.But it won't be the average horror (even ghost) movie fan's cup of tea.It has no shocks for one thing, although a lot of tension.It's a movie that completely embraces Kristen Stewart in all her glory. She is superb throughout with a highly naturalistic performance (that, as is her way, includes little in the way of humour and very few smiles).Glum. That's the way to describe her.She's barely off screen and acts with mobile phones, deserted buildings and the odd human.If you like action avoid at all costs, but for an intelligent supernatural story with brilliant acting and a highly original premise this should be just your cup of tea."
" Thematically strong, although slightly under cooked and caught between genres
",0.5106,0.9879,2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"At times I feel giving this film a 7 seems generous, but overall it's probably deserving of that score. The story lulls around a bit longer than it should and I definitely grew disengaged during certain periods of the story. However, I do believe the core concept is fairly strong and Kristen Stewart's performance is as well;having seen Certain Women only the other week, I now find myself wholly impressed with her acting ability. Basically, Maureen (Kristen Stewart) believes her recently deceased twin brother is trying to communicate with her because they had made a pact that whoever was to die first would send the other a sign to indicate that all is well and they are at peace.The mystique of the film, as you might imagine, is if Maureen is engaging with a malevolent spirit or a peaceful spirit; her brothers spirit or even a spirit at all. This ambiguity is reflective of Maureen's own disillusionment with an unfulfilling career and life, as well as her mourning.Personal Shopper sort of falls between genres and because of this it doesn't really satisfy fully as a drama nor a mystery. For me, it plays best as a narrative on grief and a characters search for identity. In this regards, the film offers an original take on those themes."

" Two Thirds of an Incredible Film
",0.0,-0.7131,2017-03-22 00:00:00,6,"Well, Personal Shopper is certainly a weird movie.The film is the second collaboration between Kristen Stewart and director Olivier Assayas, and I should mention that I haven't actually seen the first. In fact, as I realised earlier and with surprise, I actually haven't ever seen Stewart in any film – unless you count her very brief appearance at the end of the mostly-forgotten 2008 action flick Jumper. As my knowledge of her beyond that only really extended to her performances in five Twilight films and a gritty, live-action adaptation of Snow White (again, none of which I've watched), I wasn't really expecting much from her.She is excellent in this film. She manages to be both mysterious and relatable, both sexy and unlikeable, both stoic and vulnerable, and all the while channelling a cynical personality that belies a deep, hidden, desperate hope. It's an extremely complex performance, and she pulls it off tremendously. The rest of the cast is also strong, but Stewart rightly holds the spotlight.The story is... well, it's uneventful, for the most part, especially at the beginning. In fact, and unfortunately, the first twenty-five minutes is so incredibly boring that I nearly fell asleep in my seat. Granted, it was an exceptionally comfortable seat, but I'd just finished my second double-shot latte. The beginning of the film consists of Stewart walking around her dead brother's old house during the day, and then again at night. The lack of music was soothing, the creaks of the old wood lulling.I was startled out of my almost-sleep by a sudden tonal shift in the film. Now we were in a horror movie, complete with frightening visuals and multiple jump-scares. This carried on for around another fifteen minutes, after which the film became a psychological thriller, where it remained for the remainder of the movie (after a brief venture into erotic-thriller territory). I have to say, though, it kind of works, and I had no problem with the tone bouncing all over the place; however, this does not fix the incomprehensibly dull first twenty-five minutes.The rest of the film tells the story of a (you guessed it!) personal shopper who is lingering in Paris, where her brother died, on the off- chance that he might try to contact her from beyond the grave. She already knows some people, and meets some new players as the story progresses, the most notable of whom is an unknown person who forms a relationship with her via text. As she attempts to deduce her new pen- pal's identity, she goes about her day-to-day life, all the while hoping for a sign from her late twin.The technical elements are solid, if a little unambitious, and the movie sounds great across the board. The cinematography and general direction are wonderful. The plot is where I started to get really confused, particularly in the final act, and I really don't know what happened at the end. I have my theory, but I just can't reconcile it against the facts and events presented earlier. Is the ending a plot- hole? Is it intentionally nonsensical? Did it simply go over my head? It could be any of these things, but satisfying it most certainly was not."
" I frustratingly couldn't decide what this film was trying to be!
",-0.5093,-0.975,2017-03-21 00:00:00,4,"Kristen Stewart plays the grief stricken Maureen, she is a spiritual medium and the personal shopper to a super star, they currently live in Paris and we see her zipping around on her Vespa buying the 'must haves' for her millionaire employer.Her brother had recently died of a heart condition, he was also a medium and we learn that Maureen has the same heart condition. Consequently they made a promise to each other that whoever should die first would send a 'message' to the survivor. She hopes to connect with his spirit.During the middle of the film Maureen starts receiving a very long series of text messages from an unknown 'stalker'. Her employer is murdered in her hotel room and we are left wondering who did it.Kristen gave a fine performance but a negative for my wife was that she couldn't help thinking Kristen really needed to wash her grungy hair. A positive for me was that Kirsten finds a number of opportunities to get topless and reveal her 'A' cup bust. All in all this is a film about a woman grieving for her brother, an unconventional 'arty' drama, thriller, murder mystery, horror (take your pick) - I frustratingly couldn't decide what this film was trying to be!"
" A hollow vessel
",0.0,0.9158,2017-03-21 00:00:00,2,"Amongst the things I'm not overly fond of, I'd put shopping and fashion fairly high up the list. However, having read some rave 5-star reviews for Personal Shopper, with comparisons to tension a la Hitchcock (Bradshaw in the Guardian) as well as descriptions of a ghost story to make Lovecraft quail, I decided to give it a go. Oh dear.To get the good bit out of the way first, Kristen Thomas does give a fairly good performance overall as the central character, a haunted twin searching for her recently deceased brother. Which is a relief because the other characters are so thinly sketched, they might as well not be there. As is the rather confused and unsatisfying plot, if I can be so bold as to call it that. We are treated to a prolonged over-the-shoulder text message exchange fro the second section of the movie which I assume was meant to be gripping when, in fact, it's immediately obvious who is sending the ""mystery"" texts.The spooky spiritualism that's been introduced prior is largely forgotten here, as she dashes between Paris and London and back. However, at various points, the supporting characters are given clunky conversations about something really mystical man (clue: they're not, they're really bad ""plot"" devices that add nothing to the plot). I went from having a mild enthusiasm to a spreading boredom to wondering how a 100 minute movie was starting to feel like a 3-hour ordeal.The ending makes little sense whatsoever in the context of the movie and people were literally laughing out loud at the apparent presence of the dead brother showing himself by dropping a glass. Twice. The second time in a mountain hut where for completely random reasons, the heroine found herself. This is a sham movie, exactly like the sham seances it homes in on at one point. Very disappointing indeed."
" It Ain't Borzage
",0.0,0.9819,2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"Best Line I've Read Recently: ""Just because this film was booed at Cannes doesn't mean it was good enough to be part of the 'Booed at Cannes' festival.""Piece of Advice: It doesn't matter if you're trying to make a modern Horror movie. It doesn't matter if you love Hitchcock and those classic cross - cutting sequences. Text messaging will NEVER be suspenseful. No matter how you do it. No matter who does it. The big text messaging sequence reads like parody - Slackers on a Train...Thought(s) for the Day: Why SHOULDN'T Intellectuals (or Pseudo - Intellectuals) have their own Horror Movie? But...couldn't it happen - at least ONE time in my life - that when a hip iconic artist is used as a plot point, her work could CONTINUE to inform the film, in something other than an embellishmental way?This film is not terrible. But it throws a bunch of ideas against the wall. And none of them really stick. Or stick together. And poor Paris! All those cafés and motorcycles and boulevards that used to really be such great backdrops for such great movies. Now they're pretty good backdrops for OK movies.O tempora!

" Unsettling and unorthodox, albeit not Assayas' best work
",-0.5216,0.9922,2017-03-18 00:00:00,7,"The word 'atmospheric' comes to mind when thinking about this film. It may not be the intensely cerebral and deeply fascinating work that Clouds Of Sils Maria was, but director Olivier Assayas does a brilliant job at creating an intriguing and very unorthodox story about the paranormal work like clockwork, and with yet another strong performance from Kristen Stewart, Personal Shopper is indeed an engrossing watch.The one thing to bear in mind when watching this film is that it's not trying to be any sort of horror movie. A few scenes in the first act may lead you to believe it's a supernatural horror, but in reality, it's not all about jumpscares and creepy apparitions, but more about the strange and unsettling nature of watching a woman being haunted.One of the most interesting things about Personal Shopper is that it leaves a lot to the imagination. I say that the main character is being haunted, but what Assayas does very well is suggest all manner of reasons for her feelings. On the one hand, it could be just that, a ghostly spirit from beyond the grave haunting her, but on the other, it could be her own personal demons that have created something even more terrifying. As the film toys with both ideas throughout, it makes for a particularly intriguing watch, keeping you invested in an unpredictable story right up to the last.The other thing that this film does really well is grab you with piercingly intense silence. That may sound completely counter- intuitive, but an almost dialogue-free twenty-minute period of this film is by far its most enthralling. Following Kristen Stewart's character exclusively throughout that period, Olivier Assayas ingeniously heightens the smaller and quieter sounds of the world against the lack of dialogue, making for an amazingly eerie feeling that contributes massively to the film's bizarre and unsettling atmosphere.Also, Kristen Stewart's performance is once again excellent here. Although maybe not as good as her turn in Clouds Of Sils Maria, the one thing she manages to bring across really well is the sense of being deeply personally troubled. Her character is a fascinating enigma from start to finish, and her very quiet yet clearly vulnerable performance makes the threat of the demons haunting her all the more powerful, something that yet again adds so much to the unnerving vibe of the film.With all that said, however, I can't say that this film is entirely brilliant. Although I loved the direction and lead performance that made for such an engrossing atmosphere, the writing isn't always on the same level. The greatest power from this film doesn't come from the plot itself, rather the experience of watching it, and that means that when things are a little more conventional (particularly in the somewhat underwhelming first act), it's not so engrossing to watch.On the whole, I thought Personal Shopper was an impressively atmospheric and unsettling film. With some excellent and unconventional direction from Olivier Assayas, and yet another very strong performance from Kristen Stewart, there's a lot that makes this film intriguing, although its plot isn't as intelligent or interesting as I maybe would have liked."

She makes contact with the other side and adds two more different plots to a movie that did not need anymore layers really.The movie does count on your love (or hate)of Kristian Stewart. She's the one and only focus of the film as we explore her interesting life as a woman who purchases clothes for a famous woman, can contact ghost and is getting stalked by one, while dealing with her twin's death, But hey, we get to see her naked, a major plus as this movie fixates on how dead pan she can be as an actress.Overall, the filmmakers gave us a pretty interesting mix of a movie that could have acted as two or three different movies.

" Despite not labelled as Horror movie, expect several cold shivers. Perfect example that good Horror movies are indeed possible, avoiding the usual clichés
",0.8806,0.9781,2017-03-13 00:00:00,7,"Seen at the Film Fest Ghent 2016 (website: filmfestival.be/en). Despite not advertised as Horror (possibly to not scare viewers away, as Horror has a bad name), certain cold shivers could be felt several times, though I do not understand why. All the usual ""ghostly"" effects were absent, no blood, no gore, no creaking doors, and so on. Well, there was a large empty manor with a lot of rooms, stairs, doors, dark corners, and so on. Only once or twice we saw an unclear moving image appear on the wall, and only once a moving skeleton hanging from the ceiling. But that were only the minor nail-biting experiences, as these sorts of things are to be expected in a deserted house.Other ""Horror look-alike"" instances, now in clear daylight and in a normal house or hotel, had more subtle effects and hence were much more effective. Various nice ideas are included, most of these impossible to describe or to explain what is so special about it. An example yet a possible weak point is the hefty texting dialogue between our main character and someone unknown. The back-and-forth dialog is shown to us while it is building up. It is indeed something very scary when it would happen to one of us. Still, I think a better alternative should have been found that better fits a tense movie, but that is easy for me to say. I could provide other eerie examples from the screenplay at hand, but that would involve spoilers which I want to avoid at all cost.The story gets complicated halfway, showing a victim different from the one we assumed in the first place. In other words, an unexpected turn of events. More of these are to follow suit. It makes us wonder who is behind some unexplained phenomena. Everything is cleared up in the end, with just one exception where we are left in the dark (literally) what is going on, that being the moment when the final credits appear and we are left wondering whether there is more to come. The latter is not a complaint, however, just confirming that a happily-ever-after ending was impossible with these ingredients.All in all, the horror genre may have a bad name, but this is a counter example showing that the genre is really alive and finding new original ways. The movie has its faults, but the net result is interesting and shows promises for the horror genre. I know that this film is not labeled as a Horror, but that may be done on purpose to not scare away people with memories of B-film horror's, ad nauseam filled with zombies or vampires."
" texting and spirits
",0.0,0.9068,2017-03-10 00:00:00,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is quite probably the first ghost story where the most suspenseful moments center on the texts popping up on a smart phone screen. From writer/director Olivier Assayas (Clouds of Sils Maria), this one is more than a ghost story – it's also a story of grief, a search for identity, and yes, that desire or need to connect with the afterlife.It's important to note that the film kicks off not with Maureen (Kristen Stewart) carrying out her duties as described in the title, but rather by being dropped off at a once grand country home, now abandoned and the source of some terrific sound mixing. Creaking floorboards, squeaking doors and groaning walls all serenade Maureen as she spends the night in search of the spirit world. We soon learn she was actually hoping to connect with her recently deceased brother Lewis  a twin with whom she had a pact that whomever passed first (they shared a heart ""malformation"") would make contact with the other from beyond.Maureen then returns to her day job as personal shopper and all-around go-fer to her egotistical celebrity boss Kyra (Nora von Waldstatten), a high profile fashion model whose snooty ways have Maureen spewing hatred of her job during Skype sessions with her long-distance boyfriend Gary (Ty Olwin). With incessantly slumped shoulders, Maureen zips around Paris on her scooter toting shopping bags filled with expensive dresses, jewelry and shoes. She's on the outskirts of wealth and celebrity, but the to-do notes and lack of personal interaction with Kyra epitomize how far outside the circle Maureen really sits.There are moments of acting support from Sigrid Bouaziz as Lewis' girlfriend, and Lars Eidinger as a suspiciously low-key creep, but it's Kristen Stewart who carries the full weight of the film, and continues her streak of very interesting work. She does so in a manner not shy about showing her body, but also with the authentic body language of someone whose frustration grows with each successive text from ""unknown"". As a modern twist to the traditional thriller, the film also ties in the past with such touches as Swedish mystic Hilma of Klint and amateur spirit hunter Victor Hugo. It's understandable how Mr. Assaya's film received both boos AND a standing ovation at Cannes  no one is really sure how to react to the first texting ghost story!"

" This years most misleading trailer award goes to......
",0.1952,-0.9926,2017-03-08 00:00:00,2,"If you're expecting to see a thoughtful addition to modern slow burning haunted house films such as The Others or Paranormal Activity, then look somewhere else. In fact, go and watch those two, they're great films, that reward their audiences with exactly what they were expecting. Sadly, the same can't be said for Personal Shopper. A film that not only gives away a major plot point in the trailer, but also has it contain about 80% of the scares. Seriously. Watch the trailer, nearly every ""scary"" moment is in there. Sadly, you won't realise this until you've watched the film right up to the abysmal anti climatic end.I've read other reviewers say they wanted to walk out at the 30 minute mark. I can genuinely see why. I have no problem with films taking their time. In fact, it's nice to just sit back and let a director flaunt their craft. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES!!!! Everything is so dragged out. But it doesn't get us anywhere. We're subjected to a 20 minute back and forth text conversation, that does nothing, except make you want to check your own phone. It's a tedium that's not resolved either. We're left wondering who's on the other end of the conversation? In fact, I'm still not sure why it's even in there. It serves absolutely no purpose to the plot. If they'd left it out, you wouldn't have missed it. It's that irrelevant. There's also a brutal murder of a major character (but, if you've seen the trailer, you know who it is, and where it happens), but it's wrapped up inside 10 minutes, and not mentioned again. So that's the film, what about tween idol Kristen Stewart? Well that's where there is a slight ray of hope (albeit an emo friendly black one). Granted, she does do what people have come to expect, which is essentially look sullen and pout. However, that actually works here, as her character is dealing with a very recent death of a twin, who died from a condition she has, and may kill her in the same spontaneous manner. So as far as casting is concerned, she's a clever choice. It's hard to comment on the rest of the cast, as they fleet in and out so quickly, you'll struggle to remember them. Think Daniel Radcliffe in the Woman in Black, only instead of Kristen Stewart being surround by creepy toys with renaissance eyes, she's surrounded by real people who serve no purpose, and aren't given long enough to have one.As far as the supernatural element goes, it feels tacked on. The trailer lead me to believe that there's either a malevolent spirit chasing Bella Swan, and like Paranormal Activity, it'll get stronger the more attention she gives it, or that she's a medium who doesn't know it, and her day to day life is invaded by her unknown powers. This is not the case for either. Every time something spooky happens, it's treated as the norm, and nobody is overly phased by the fact that this girl is seeing full entities. Even she takes it in her stride. The whole thing ends up feeling like somebody filmed Kristen Stewart, then at the last minute thought ""I like ghosts"". If you want to see a decent haunted house chiller, this isn't for you. If you want to see a decent murder mystery, this isn't for you. If you want to see the girl from Twilight in nothing but little black pants, give it a go. For me though, this is a disappointment that rivals The Girl on the Train."
" Personal shopper finds she shares dead twin's access to the spiritualist world
",-0.4767,-0.2859,2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"So what's the significance of a ""personal shopper"" discovering she has  the medium's power to communicate with the world of spirits?  That's the point when Maureen Cartwright starts sensing ghostly  spirits. The first is when she checks her dead twin brother Lewis's  house for his friends who want to buy it. They want assurance that if  there are spirits they are friendly not malevolent.   She feels another alien presence when she finds her tycoon boss  savagely slaughtered, another when her sister-in-law's new man assures  her of his friend, her brother, Lewis's understanding. Lewis sensed she  shared his power, as they shared the same mortal heart defect. Visiting  her boyfriend in Dubai Maureen encounters another, whose film-ending  message is yes, the power is within her.  In a parody of these disembodied voices and influences, her boss's  rejected lover hustles and hassles Maureen with anonymous and  unsettling text messages. To him she admits her attraction to and fear  of the forbidden. Talking to the dead ranks in there, along with any  Frankensteinian presumption to transcend the proper borders of mortal  existence.   There's a continuum from the characters' conversations in person,  through Skype and cell phone calls, emails, and those mysterious  unsettling texts, and on out into the messages from the dead. Her  boyfriend's job is the cognate cyber security. He sets up internet  security protocols for the Dubai government.   The point of the title and the heroine's dissatisfying and empty job is  that she outgrows it. She abandons the search through the trivial  material world and extends herself into the spiritualist. She accepts  the challenge and distinction of the woman painter whose spiritualism  inspired her abstract paintings before the genre was established.   The personal shopper is the boss's agent or intermediary, searching out  and buying/borrowing the clothes and accessories the star needs to  flaunt but hasn't the time or inclination to find for herself. In the  course of this ghost story Maureen stops finding for her boss and finds  herself. From mediating with fashonistas and jewellers she turns to  mediating between our material world and the transcending world beyond  it. That's where she discovers her fullest potential as a person."
" Stewart triumphs once again
",0.4588,0.9736,2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"""Personal Shopper"" is a French-German co-production that is in the English language because the lead actress here is Kristen Stewart. Writer and director is French filmmaker Olivier Assayas and he worked with Stewart very recently already on a movie that resulted in major critics awards recognition for the young actress. So no surprise that they decided to reunite so quickly and this time Stewart is even the lead actress (and not Binoche). The German impact comes through the participation of actors like von Waldstätten and Eidinger in supporting roles. But it is really Stewart's movie. She is in absolutely every scene from start to finish and gives a commanding performance that manifests her in the acting elite from her generation, probably even as the number 1 at this point. She has her very own niche in terms pf physicality and approach and she fills it with grace. People who still think she sucks because of what she did in Twilight a decade ago have certainly lost their credicble connection when it comes to understanding what film is about these days.Now about this one here: It runs for 105 minutes approximately and is a relatively dark film. Stewart plays a personal shopper for a celebrity, which means she is busy buying her clothes because the star does not have time for that herself. But she is much more. She is also a medium who tries to get in contact with her deceased twin brother and now you already see why I call this a pretty dark movie. Stewart's looks fit the character very nicely. It's obvious she is suffering a lot from the whole situation and her encounters with ghosts make things even worse. And if that isn't already enough, she already suffers from a rare heart disease that complicates things, even if she says it doesn't worry her. The movie itself takes several directions in terms of the approach to mystery and horror and thriller. Sometimes the ghosts are very visible in ghost form, sometimes they are visible in human form, sometimes they aren't visible at all, can only be heard and at one point the film even turns into a murder mystery, during which one character tries to use the protagonist for his own sinister purposes when he frames her with murder. Will it work out? Watch for yourself.Anyway, as a whole I enjoyed this movie for the most part. Lengths are almost non-existent, but I am probably a bit biased here as I just love watching Stewart as an actress and not only is she stunningly beautiful again while still pulling off that somewhat casual regular look and male audiences can be interested here in particular because we get to see a whole lot of her here and with this I don't just mean her looking stunningly beautiful in an expensive dress. And what we hear from her in one particular scene is almost even better. No more spoilers. You need to watch this one and you will immediately know what I mean. I personally thought Stewart gives an awesome performance that would have deserved an Oscar nomination, but it is okay. I'm sure her first Academy Award (nomination) is only a matter of time because of how unique she is right now in the industry. She puts her full talent on display here and carries a pretty good movie by herself. The only people that I would not recommend seeing it are those who neither like Stewart nor supernatural (yet subtle) horror films. The only reason why I did not give it a higher rating is probably because ghost movies are not exactly my cup of tea. But Stewart makes it work and elevates the material a lot, no doubt about it."
