" ONE OF THE TOP SOLO MARVEL FLICKS
",0.5574,0.9675,2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"Dr. Strange is awesome any way you watch it but I enjoyed it much more upon my second viewing. Which was years after my first time seeing it and just after Wandavision wrapped up. This film is the true origin story of Marvel's next phase that will explore and focus heavy on the Multiverse. It is also one of the more visually stimulating of the Marvel movies. I'd put it right up there with Ragnarok and both Guardians films. Definitely not only worth watching before going too deep into the new phase, but I think it's required."
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.9153,2021-03-25 00:00:00,9,One of the Best marvel films. It's my fav among all marvel movies
" Hurry up!
",0.0,0.9051,2021-03-24 00:00:00,10,"Wonderful movie! But more than me, my future wife loved it and insists that she s gonna marrie me only if the sequel will be ready SOON and only if its betterüòÆ"
" Not sure what was going on
",-0.2411,-0.04,2021-03-21 00:00:00,4,The movie sort of started well and Cumberbatch was doing a fine job as Strange. By the mid part i wasn't sure what it was rumbling on about and I fell asleep.
" The best special effects ever.
",0.7845,0.992,2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,"Great story and acting, but the special effects are another things, just amazing and great, they are so great that I simply think is the one with better visual and special effects in marvel and that is a lot because all of them have a great effect."
" MCU made for people...
",0.0,0.8745,2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"...over the age of 15 for once! Fantastic lead, Benedict never disappoints, but he's meant for this role. Better VFX than the avengers movies, that's for sure."
" An amazing but paper thin experience
",0.34,0.9505,2021-02-26 00:00:00,7,"This movie was built for the big screen. And it knows it. The visuals and booming sound design is incredible. But the plot is sadly just a generic rendition of the hero's journey that thousands of films have done before. The ending does try to be something new but if you have seen a movie before nothing in this one will surprise you. But let's be honest, you just saw an awesome trailer and bought a ticket so grab your popcorn, set aside the plot holes, and be blown away by some of the best visual effects ever seen on the big screen."
" It's an underrated movie
",0.0,0.6808,2021-02-25 00:00:00,9,One of the finest of marvel movie. It set the marvel industry higher.
" Best Marvel Movie
",0.7906,0.9201,2021-02-23 00:00:00,10,This is my favorite Marvel movie. I can't wait to see the new one that will come out. I love magic and mysticism and Dr Strange captures that essence wonderfully.
" VFXüôåüèº
",0.0,0.9477,2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"The visual effects were terrific, the VFX artists who worked on this movie deserve a lot of recognition. The plot was ok, interesting, but I have seen better movies of Marvel. I enjoyed the movie whatsoever so I'll give it a 7/10 more for the astonishing visual effects."
" Really cool visuals
",0.3804,0.9984,2021-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Dr. Strange it's about a guy who discovers there's more to life and Earth than he knew, and it's in the discovery of these other worlds and possible abilities that he finds a purpose that should work towards his healing. One thing's for sure and that's the fact that the movie is extremely trippy. The ways the laws of physics and nature are distorted in various ways are indeed strange, but really cool. Buildings and entire cities fold in on themselves, people move through time and space, literal out of body experiences. It really is crazy but looks amazing. The film has a really good cast which also includes Rachel McAdams, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Mads Mikkelsen. The guys I thought did a great job in their supporting roles. The film manages to fit in plenty of action in what seems unusual of Marvel less than 2 hours. At the heart of it though is also a really good story. A lot of it is crazy trippy! But it's still a well told narrative. There's good dialogue with the occasional comedy thrown in. The relationship between Strange and Wong was particularly funny. I'm not sure how intentional it was but it came across like the movie had a religious current running through it. The idea of eternal life, which is central to many faiths, was a fairly important element to the story. There was also a sense that in order to see what is beyond this world you must dismiss what you think you know and truly believe in the higher power that exists. This is an interesting and unexpected theme ingrained within the story.
On the whole, Dr strange is an exciting, funny, well written flick. The CGI looked really amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch was terrific. It had the feeling of a Marvel movie, but with a psychedelic twist. Very fun and enjoyable."
" A good entry into the MCU
",0.4404,0.9929,2021-01-31 00:00:00,7,"This one holds up surprisingly well on a rewatch. I was bummed to find some of the effects already looking dated in Civil War, but almost all of the visual effects-heavy shots in Doctor Strange hold up (probably thanks to how fantastical and decidedly not grounded in reality many of those shots are).There are some very cool visuals and set pieces, the cast is very good, and it's paced well, clocking in well under two hours if you factor out the almost 10 minutes of credits.Despite mostly working, I'd say as a screenplay it doesn't quite feel 100% satisfying, and great actors like Mikkelsen and Swinton are good but kind of under-utilised (Chiwetel Ejiofor is good but maybe goes a little too hard? He kinda sounds like a voice actor from the Elder Scrolls, the way he speaks in some scenes üòÖ)"
" Vapid Hollow And Strange
",-0.2023,-0.872,2021-01-31 00:00:00,4,"Despite only being 109 minutes long, Dr Strange feels much longer. It's no surprise that the film has such a limited runtime because there isn't any substantial story. It's not till about an hour into the film that the real plot gets going;the first half just serving as backstory and exposition. Except for a couple of glimpses of Mads Mikkelsen's character and his goons. And it's a good thing we dont see more of them. They are the epitome of hokey and downright comical. Now I understand that in a picture like this it's not hard to overstep and end up very inane. Still, this pushes it too far, even they're facial expressions are exaggerated. But if there's anything worse than these characters, it's the action surrounding them. There's no question that it took a page out of Inception's book, imitating the transmuting worlds and off the wall fight sequences. I don't think there was anything to copy in Inception-it was Christopher Nolan's absurd vision and seeing it once was enough.
But this film decided to recreate it only to a larger(and worse)degree.The picture also contains much of the amateurish dialouge and overall poor filmmaking that most superhero films do. Benedict Cumberbatch is better actor than one who should be taking roles in such second rate, vapid and strange films."
" A great first act.
",0.6249,-0.9662,2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,"This movie definitely makes you like Doctor Strange with that first act. He was a neurosurgeon who gets in to a terrible accident which forced him to retire. He slowly begins to lose money and on the verge of obviously homeless ness he decides to visit some spiritual people who change his life forever.My flaws with the movie is that the master character known as the Ancient One died so quickly, she felt like a wasted character. The villain who caused her death had zero personality and is your typical hey I'm just really powerful his name is Kaecillius. There this black character in the movie his name is Karl Mordo who is set up to become a future antagonist for our main character Doctor Strange clearly seems like he's going to become a terrible villain. He was basically feels disillusioned that his master the Ancient One was breaking the laws of nature these with there mystic arts. To do good things mind you it and idk I just feel like he going to be a bad character in the future.Overall alright movie, Doctor Strange himself is a great character."
" One of the best movies in Marvel film Universe
",0.7906,0.9705,2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"One of the best movies in Marvel film Universe. Perhaps he is focused on more adult audience by what other movies. It is of course the movie on one viewing, but Benedict Cumberbatch plays perfectly and extends the movie. It is possible to treat on a miscellaneous Marvel, but this movie should be watched."
" Doctor Strange
",-0.2023,0.9981,2021-01-23 00:00:00,6,"Doctor Strange, directed by Scott Derrickson, throws us Marvel fans a complete curve ball, with his execution and style, but it paid off well! With Doctor Strange having a tough back story to sculpt into frame, Derrickson and the creative team made the best out of it, creating this inventive, mind bending film, with so many twist and turns, while involving new and creative ideas. Sadly, the biggest issue of the film, is the story. This, by the numbers premise, has been used and abused many times by the MCU. Derrickson created some great potential for a new world building opportunity, with a pace that doesn't have a lot of downtime to play around, but because of the clunky scene structure, choppy pace, and surplus of exposition, a lot of events and characters went underdeveloped; If this film was another fifteen minutes longer, it would've allowed for developing in their weak spots. Scott Derrickson didn't shy away from giving us that darker tone, involving decent risks, but when they tried to tone things down, the conflicting tones didn't mesh well with eachother.Benedict Cumberbatch was the saving grace of the film. He absolutely steals every scene he's in, bringing this tremendous amount of snarky wit and range to the character. Although he is a likable character, he reminds me of a generic Tony Stark, that just tried to capture his charisma, but he wasn't as interesting or exuberant. His character development was fine, but it was ran through so quickly, that the time frame just didn't add up. His love interest, for lack of better terms, in Rachel McAdams is fine; she serves her purpose, but she's pretty forgettable, not having much to do in the film. She tankfully wasn't over saturated, but the casting choice itself was a little much, riding the cusp of being disposable. Tilda Swinton is another casting that was a little over done, but she fits the role really well. Her character is complex, yet subtle, having a few interesting aspects to her character and backstory, but due to her character being slightly underdeveloped, we didn't get as much as we could've from her. Chiwetel Ejiofor was another solid addition to the film, putting on a good performance, but he didn't add that much, other than some exposition. Mads Mikkelsen put on a good performance as Kaecilius, being a real intense presence, but I needed much more on his character. We got a little backstory on him, but everything felt very forced, and fast with his character, that he just didn't get the development he deserved.The screenplay by Scott Derrickson, Jon Spaihts, and C. Roberts Cargill, had a tough time balancing everything, between the story, the characters, and the humor. They had a few high points, but the humor took me out of the film, due to it being really forced.This was most definitely one of the best looking films of the MCU! There was so many great colors and visuals that just pop off the screen, with immaculate detail and style. With this being a real effects-heavy film, it was one of the driving forces, being seamlessly crafted! The action of the film was fun, but it wasn't handled the greatest, lacking good shots and creative fight sequences.Overall, Doctor Strange is a real fun, and inventive film, but it doesn't come without flaws. Doctor Strange is one of the better films of the MCU, but it isn't one of those blockbuster hits like some of these other titles are."
" Not one I love, but it is one I like
",0.2654,0.9938,2021-01-20 00:00:00,7,"One of my least favourites so far in the MCU. Still a good film, no doubt.'Doctor Strange' features a lot of intrigue and lore, which is certainly interesting to see unfold. I just felt a few pacing issues, nothing that frustrated me but it just felt a little slow moving in moments. I still enjoyed it, the story is a pleasant one and all the effects look splendid.Benedict Cumberbatch is great in the lead role, I thoroughly enjoyed his performance. Mads Mikkelsen and Tilda Swinton are good in this as well, especially the latter. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rachel McAdams are likeable in their respective roles, also.Not one I love, but it is one I like."
" First review
",0.0,0.9294,2021-01-15 00:00:00,10,This movie is amazing the director really used his imagination to top level pity he has left but still hope because Sam raimi Lets hope sequel is just as good
" Really good
",0.4927,0.9762,2021-01-07 00:00:00,7,I rewatched this again as the first time I didn't understand it but the second time it was so good. The story was amazing and marvel never fails to disappoint. Hopefully there is a second one coming out.
" Top notch marvel storytelling
",0.5574,0.9954,2021-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Doctor Stephen Strange is an incredibly gifted neurosurgeon and one of the best in his field, but a man engorged in his own ego. After a tragic accident driving his high end sports car, his fingers are totally mangled leaving him lost and he loses his profession from being unable to preform the work. Strange is then plunged into obsession to fix his hand unsuccessfully, this bleeds him dry. Yearning to apply his gifts he seeks out guidance which lands him in Nepal where he learns to use the strength of his mind to heal his body with the help from the mythic arts he is able to tap into his metaphysical abilities giving him the sort of purpose that not even his past profession could even fathom. Once Strange is introduced to the Ancient one, he must once again focus on his skill and any deductions he notices to tap into the depths of his being in order to overcome this intensive power struggle.This is by far some of the prettiest visuals you'll see in a Marvel film its quite honestly top notch in my opinion. The cast also a great strength of the film in my humble opinion Benedict Cumberbatch was born to play a Marvel superhero i mean that name is pretty badass and really iconic already. The roots of this film ties into the entire Marvel universe so beautifully. As you continue through The Infinity Saga you pick up on things from this film even years later, thats amazing storytelling and as every last film of the Saga was successful this story was executed magically."
" Gets better and better every time
",0.7003,0.9556,2020-12-28 00:00:00,8,"Personally, I find that every time I watch ""Doctor Strange,"" I enjoy it slightly more than I did before. I suppose it comes down to my belief that ""Doctor Strange"" is far more rooted in reality than many other Marvel movies. Whereas many others have storylines that audiences and humanity in general cannot exactly relate to, ""Doctor Strange"" (simply put) follows a man who loses his way. After a bad car accident, Dr. Stephen Strange finds that he is unable to continue his work as a surgeon, and essentially spirals into despair. He eventually finds salvation in the mystic arts, finally understanding that the world does not revolve around him and becoming involved in a battle to save Earth. In terms of Marvel stories, that is fairly simplistic.Let me make myself clear: ""Doctor Strange"" is in no way a simple movie. Many scenes (especially those in the mirror dimension) are some of the trippiest scenes to ever grace a Marvel title. We're talking ""Inception""-level chaos. What I mean is that the story itself is fairly simplistic, which allows audiences to sympathize with Strange. Almost everyone has had or will have a crisis of faith. It's something we can understand, and I think that makes ""Doctor Strange"" a very solid film.On another note, the characters and cast in this movie are spot-on. Benedict Cumberbatch is literally PERFECT at being an arrogant neurosurgeon-turned Master of the Mystic Arts, Rachel McAdams is perfect as the down-to-Earth and often extremely confused Christine, and Benedict Wong is wonderful as... Wong. Huh. I never noticed they had the same name. Anyways, they're all hilarious in some way. Tilda Swinton (The Ancient One) and Mads Mikkelsen (Kaecilius) are more serious in tone, but both still have marvelous performances. I won't really mention Mordo, because he's a little annoying (even though I suppose that's purposeful). Chiwetel Ejiofor still does a great job of playing him though.So overall, I really enjoy ""Doctor Strange"" nowadays. I suppose its more realistic approach to characters was a little off-putting to me at first, but I think I've warmed up to it."
" Most amazing CGI ever
",0.624,0.9448,2020-12-16 00:00:00,8,"The Jungle book won the Oscar for best visual effect, without a doubt it was very great.. but everything was predictable, it was just perfectly done. However, what Doctor Strange did was more than perfectly done, it's about the most craziest imagination that anyone had ever done in movie industry up to date."
" still great
",0.6249,0.9042,2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,"Gave it a 7/10 upon release, and after a second watch its still a solid 7. Although the marvel humor is starting to annoy me, all the other aspects of the movie were solid all through. Great themeing, solid writing, and well polished.7/10: yep yeppers"
" Doctor Strange (2016) Review - 8.3/10
",-0.2023,0.7814,2020-12-12 00:00:00,8,"I have to admit that I like this film better than most. And while I can understand some of the criticisms, I absolutely love this film. Especially the special effects, which are just top-notch in the MCU. Tilda Swinton and Benedict Cumberbatch also give great performances, which can only help. And Kaecilius is an underrated villain, played by the great, Mads Mikkelsen. In short, I have nothing but positive things to say about this movie."
" Generic big budget movie
",0.0,0.9938,2020-12-12 00:00:00,6,"I wanted to see this movie because I haven't seen that many new super hero movies they've put out over the last 10 years.I wanted to see what the hype was about and I wasn't wrong, it's just a big budget hollywood film, generic, nothing special about it. Wooden acting, they sound as if they were reciting their lines, specially Tilda Swinton. Every character is very one dimensional.It's just dull and plain unengaging. Movies like this should go all the way, but it feels they only do the bare minimum. I didn't care for any character, and the movie also looks boring. A film with a plot like this should have breathtakingly beautiful visuals and disctintive music, but everything looks and sounds like a regular modern movie. The effects were cool to watch, yes, was it memorable? no. Although the scene in the beginning where he is like flying through different dimensions discovering all of this for the first time was really pretty to look at. Really nice colors.Overall I wish super hero movies were unique, engaging, unforgettable art pieces but everything I've seen looks and feels like a copy of a copy."
" Arrogance evaginates into Reinvention
",-0.5267,0.9985,2020-12-07 00:00:00,9,"Before you can reinvent yourself you first must come to believe you can reinvent yourself.I grew up reading Doctor Strange and pasting a two page poster illustrated by the great Steve Ditko on the ceiling of the club house we built in Earl's backyard. It was my bright idea to put in a floor with a stack of two by sixes that were lying against the back of his family's house. Since his parents were on vacation down South visiting relatives, and there was no one to tell us we couldn't do it, we dug three feet deep out of the dirt floor to put in the boards that fit perfectly snug to my surprise. The older boys were thinking they could lure unsuspecting girls into this clubhouse to make out with them, but I was just glad to be part of a gang that made and built things and could use my ideas. This illusion did not last long, but was comforting to embrace that particular summer.Marvel Comics was an intimate part of this world of adolescent becoming. Marvel Heroes engaged in battles like Sugar Ray Robinson's boxing matches, and introduced the reader to concepts of science and physics in such a way that even children gradually becoming men could understand them. I remember telling a story in Music Class based upon a dream where my close friends suddenly became Super Heroes. It was well received and led to me later writing down my stories on paper.The story of Doctor Strange is about someone and something I know, like the chronicles of Muhammad Ali and Clint Eastwood, from the root to the cornucopia of fruit that was produced. The first character I wrote about was an amalgam of Doctor Strange and Prince Namor, the Submariner. A character who was tasked to find redemption from his own arrogance in order to accomplish a return to status. Many who have seen the films consider them 'far out' tales of Action and Adventure. But those of us who were fortunate enough to discover the worlds of Lee, Kirby, and Ditko in our youth, know that, except in a handful of cases, these stories do not go 'far out' enough, and only scratch the surface of what we initially experienced in the Marvel Universe.I know the Ditko Doctor Strange like the back of my hand. Aristotle has been quoted as saying a man cannot become a hero until he can see the root of his own downfall. This is the Doctor Strange saga in a nutshell. Standing on the summit of a great kinesiological gift and intelligence as a healer, he is nonetheless brought low by an overweening desire for self aggrandizement in lieu of committing his talents to the service of others. Now, in seeking a return to the status of high technical skill, he instead undergoes a spiritual transformation into a Master of the Mystic Arts.There is a great truth in this simple story. The idea that there truly is no 'going back', only a spiraling forward into greater and greater incarnations of self for those who wish to truly experience enlightenment. There are two incidents in the story where we see the results and consequences of 'going back' in the most graphic and agonizing ways. I'll let you consider and pick out for yourself what they are.The Doctor Strange saga is rich in thematic content and ripe for such cultivation. I'll never forget Doctor Strange being on the run from the minions of his then nemesis Baron Mordo. How he boarded an airplane and found it necessary to project an astral self to battle with mystic bolts of energy wraith-like creatures who oozed through the fuselage into the passenger compartment and fought head up with him while the expressions on the rest of the passengers faces showed them to be oblivious to what was going on in this alternate plane. I'll never forget the final panels in one Doctor Strange comic book where Baron Mordo finally defeated him, (at least for one episode) and you saw him gradually disappear into the inky black void of the comic book panel. He was just a grasping hand reaching out into nothingness, until even that part of him was gone and the next panel was all black. We alarmed readers were advised by the editors that this was not the end of the Doctor Strange adventure.There was an animated version of DOCTOR STRANGE - THE SORCERER SUPREME (2007), that treated the character more as a healer rather than a mystic warrior. Here Doctor Strange employs supernatural means to extinguish a virus that is visiting sickness to countless children in many hospital wards. I recommend this particular adventure for your viewing pleasure as well.The present incarnation of DOCTOR STRANGE, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as titular hero and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo, is as good as it gets. Mads Mikkelson of CASINO ROYALE (2006), and the television series HANNIBAL (2013-2015) is appropriately menacing and horrific as Kaecilius, with his band of zealots seeking the darkest kind of mystic supremacy. Rachel McAdams also makes for a heartfelt main squeeze for Stephen Strange, saving his bacon when he needs it the most. Tilda Swinton is a surprising revelation as the Ancient One, and Benjamin Bratt helps embody the moral of the story as the regenerated Jonathan Pangborn.Director Scott Derrickson has created something of an origami masterpiece involving folding spaces and dimensions adding fuel to the argument that cinema is essentially a fusion of photography, music and freely employed elements of painting. The script by John Spaiths is as witty and fast paced as the comic book versions of Doctor Strange, and I believe Steve Ditko would approve of the graphic presentation, produced by Kevin Feige for what appears to be a well spent $165-236.6 million for a film that has gone on to gross three or four times as much.I understand that a sequel is scheduled for March 25th, 2022 entitled DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS, and I am looking forward to viewing where these adventures take our sorcerer next."
" Pretty forgettable
",0.4939,0.9838,2020-11-29 00:00:00,5,"One thing I've realized when watching the MCU all the way through, is how Marvel don't put nearly the same amount of effort into all of their movies. Sometimes they create an origin story so filled with life and personality it's astounding, and sometimes I forget about the movie I just watched after about 10 minutes. And one of the most prominent examples of this is this movie, Dr. Strange. That being said, I did quite enjoy a fair portion of the movie. The main character is great, he's well written and funny, and Benedict Cumberbatch obviously helps a lot with his comedic timing and facial expressions. I also like the set designs, and the movie had a very distinct tone for a little while, which I liked. The crazy action scenes that takes place within the mirror realm are also great. Unfortunately though, for every thing I enjoyed, there were one thing I didn't. The rest of the characters are very forgettable, apart from maybe The Ancient One. The villain is particularly bad, although at this point I'm not even suprised considering Marvel's track record when it comes to villains. The plot itself is also super forgettable, it's just another case of the main character having to save the world without any compelling personal reason. The pacing is also a little off. Sometimes the movie slows way down, sometimes it progresses way too quickly. The finale is not very interesting, although I do like its comedic tone. Overall, this is a watchable movie. Nothing more, nothing less. I don't really have any particular desire to watch it again, and I doubt I will talk much about it every again."
" Fun movie
",0.5106,0.9201,2020-11-28 00:00:00,8,Great special effects. Good tongue-in-cheek humor and of course Benedict C. plays arrogance beautifully.
" Insanely fun
",0.5106,0.9627,2020-10-26 00:00:00,8,"Doctor Strange is an incredibly enjoyable film with lots of very creative visuals and even some good dramatic scenes every now and then, as well as some really good performances from Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton.It's also my mom's favorite Marvel movie because she's a doctor, so of course I'm also gonna like it."
" The Best of the Marvel Universe
",0.7906,0.6167,2020-10-24 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a winner.Spectacular visuals, creatively represented that incorporate into the story side by side with the drama of a man searching to discover all he thinks he has lost.I can't imagine anyone else than BC playing this role, it is perfection.It keeps moving forward with a fantastic pacing that is fast but never feels rushed.Great touches of action/drama and humour.Staggered the sequel has been so long in coming!!"
" MIND-BLOWING awesome movie üëç

" Sweet Spot in Marvel
",0.7003,0.9922,2020-09-24 00:00:00,9,"I am over 50 watching all the Marvel Movies in order- can't lie, this did NOT interest me in the theater.. but, REALLY!!!? What a freakin surprise.. one of the best visual movies I have ever watched and a great Marvel movie too. Of course, it helps having your 18 year old around to answer your questions like- ""what's his super power,"" ""why does the cape come to him?"", why this, why that. Overall, I usually just rate stars but this, THIS, was a great movie. Enjoy!!!"
" Mind blowing best film ever
",0.6369,0.9785,2020-09-14 00:00:00,10,The journey of this film of the comic book character shown in this perfect way is absolutely stunning though there was a lil bit I didn't like how they made magic to just visual effects but the emotions the origin of this beloved marvel hero was excited very nicely
" Excellent
",0.5719,0.7351,2020-09-12 00:00:00,10,One of the best marvel movies ever .....Doctor Strange delivers a phenomenal performance... Had me glued the whole time
" Overrated
",0.0,0.9446,2020-09-09 00:00:00,5,A good film but is overrated. The story of the film is average. The screenplay is kind of slow. The direction is good. The CGI and visual effects are outstanding. The performances of the cast are good. You can either go for it or you can rewatch other spectacular mcu movies.
" Total Entertainment
",0.4215,0.9485,2020-09-04 00:00:00,10,"My grandsons and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I didn't want to miss a beat! Great action and special effects, tossed with some clever humor ous moments. We will watch this movie again!"
" The only respectable MCU movie.
",0.4404,0.8777,2020-09-04 00:00:00,8,"It doesn't follow other MCU movie with their cheap jokes and a standard storyline. The ending was rather amazing than others with no big showdown and just a negotiation.Benedict Cumberbatch was, as always, awesome as Doctor Strange and Dormammu. The visuals were really good and the storyline was gripping.Worth watching."
" Strange, Indeed
",-0.2023,0.9704,2020-09-01 00:00:00,5,"First things first:
Stephen Strange's spells are spoken incantations, not gestures. Without invoking an Entity, his spells should not work. There is magic of the mind (very few movies do this), magic with wands (Harry Potter) and magic of the spoken word (Dr. Strange and most other Marvel sorcerers). Yet, no words are used in the movie.
It is more akin to Kung Fu meets the Leonardo DiCaprio movie 'Inception' with the moving landscapes and folding buildings.
If that's what makes a movie good for some, great. But hardly creative. And certainly NOTHING like Dr. Strange comic books.
And making Hilda Swinton The Ancient One just go get good box office and not offend China (the Ancient One was Tibetan, but we wouldn't want to upset China, would we? So, they changed the entire background of The Ancient One to make it palatable to China. Go, Team!) There were many more qualified MALE, ASIAN actors who could have filled this role more admirably.
The movie is gimmicky, although passable enough for those who haven't been reading about Stephen since 1970. But overall, just passable, although the Dormmamu scene was cleverly carried out. I should point out that Mordo is Strange's enemy in the comic books. He is jealous that the Ancient One chose Strange over him, and in fact, Mordo conspires WITH Dormmanu to kill Stephen in the comic books. But never let history stand in the way of a movie, right?
Cumberbatch was a good choice for strange, but his speeches lack the gravity (""Who's laughing now, a**hole?"") WHAT?!?!? That's the language of a 22 year old. Stephen is 45, a little past trendy colloquials popping out of his mouth. Also, the astral self cannot appear in the physical realm (such as when he reveals himself in the operating room to his former colleague).
Gaping plot holes and flaws prevent me from giving it more than a 5, although I can see why others enjoy it: they like the flash and spectacle. Dr. Strange should be much more nuanced and subtle than having the Cape of Levitation pulling him backwards, as though it is sentient (it is not), in a hilarious, Keystone Cops moment.
But take this with a grain of salt. At 70, I've been reading this more than probably 2 or 3 of you combined. Just call me the crusty old curmudgeon - who insists on a more realistic portrayal of a character. To date, ONLY Wonder Woman is COMPLETELY who she is in the comic books. (Well, that's slightly unfair. Iron Man comes close, as does Spider Man, but the Iron Man in the comic books is not nearly as glib as Morton Downey plays him). Thor is a joke (been reading him since I was 12, so...58 years).
But, back to Strange.If you want something to feel supernatural, take a page out of Harry Potter, or Lord of The Rings, and do it RIGHT. This is kiddie stuff splash-the-special-effects-across-the-screen moviemaking. Pedantic, but I grant you, ""entertaining"" as long as you don't know enough about the characters. And I'm not sure I agree that there is much character development. Just moments of gravitas, which is not remotely the same as actual character development (Again, see Wonder Woman for TRUE character development).
Decent, but no more than that."
" Here we go
",0.0,0.9744,2020-08-31 00:00:00,6,When I first started watching this film it was slightly enjoyable at first good characters good plot but then issues started coming through for instance in the book Doctor Strange becomes a doctor in order to help save his sister during the surgery she dies. After this strange focuses more on getting things and pushes himself what's the point that no one likes him he's considered too legalistic and too much of an old man even you know he's Young the death of his sister affected him. This aspect of humanity could have been used in Doctor Strange but it didn't instead they tried to push the girlfriend narrative which they could have done. But the way they did it in my opinion wasn't the greatest then we have the sorcerer Supreme you would think it would have been played by an Asian person but instead it was a woman that in real life looks like a boy I know why they chose her for a bit of an otherworldly look I guess. But I really wish they would have went with an Asian man for that role it would have made more sense. On top of that there are aspects of humour littered throughout the film. Some good some bad the ending of the film is pretty good but when you look at the film as a whole and understand the source material in my opinion I would watch the animated version of Doctor Strange this one seems to have all of the Hollywood boxes checked and that seems to be what is holding it back
" A little more Interstellar Overdrive
",0.0,0.8834,2020-08-20 00:00:00,3,"I was curious about the casting of Tilda Swinton's for, what is in the comics, a Tibetan character.Marvel Studios' movies can deal with refugees, blind patriotism and other slightly (masked behind sci-fi) political topics. But Casting a European in the role of a Tibetan character in the midst of a Tibetan crisis is cold. It kind of made me rethink all the characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and what they stand for.Generally, the humbling character experiences are a nice a warm touch throughout movies like Dr, Strange, Ant-Man and Spider.-Man. But I feel like I'm being played."

",0.5023,0.7282,2020-08-14 00:00:00,7,"Potentially the most surreal and supernatural addition to the Marvel film franchise disappointingly turns out to be the most formulaic. Cumberbatch is great as the gruff, egotistical Doctor Strange, almost playing him as an anti-hero as well as adding moments of his trademark acerbic wit. Other than some kaleidoscopic SFX the rest plays out pretty predictably. Even Swinton seemed to be coasting adding little uniqueness to a stereotypical mystic; which is strange considering her unorthodox casting. So nothing terrible to see here, but nothing especially new or exciting either. Shame."
" Doctor Dull: A Faithless Adaptation
",-0.5719,-0.9956,2020-08-10 00:00:00,1,"Of all the the adaptions of comic books into film this is probably one the least faithful, changing several characters from their attitudes powers and even skin colors just to make a quick buck. And before you think of labeling me a racist know this, the two characters whose race was changed were both Asian and were made black and white just to appeal to the American demographic which seems stupid since there are more Asians in the world than both white and black people combined. Marvel is very guilty of race changing for the sake of ""diversity"" now they are also responsible for white washing characters which seem counterintuitive to their political agenda. Next they'll make Luke Cage a small Inuit man, Johnny Storm will be a 50 foot reptile terrorizing Tokyo, Nick Fury will be an alien from Planet X, Thor will be Zeus, The Hulk will be an old man Alzheimer's who constantly forgets how to smash, and Spider-Man will sprout wing and call himself angel. Turning established characters into slightly different versions of the same character yet still calling them by the name of the old characters seems stupid and pointless when you can just create a new character instead even Stan Lee said he was against that kind of thinking. Speaking of the creators of Dr. Strange the filmmakers neglected to contact Steve Ditko because he was just a silly old man who created all the characters in their not cinema ""film"". The part about Steve Ditko being silly was me being sarcastic in case no one picked up on that. Eggs Benedict Cabbagepatch Kids is again the same old character the art arrogant genius who nobody gets the same character he and Johnny Depp always play. Baron Mordo is now black and now a totally different character and steals a sacred scroll or something. White ugly old lady with cancer who thinks she can play a wise old Asian man senses the chosen one will come. Doctor strange The neurosurgeon is an arrogant blowhard genius with a heart of gold, gets into a car crash and his hands are crushed so he can no longer perform surgery. He spends almost all his money trying to fix his hands which at best would take years of therapy without magic. But he's a spoiled Narcissistic brat And wants his hands fixed now, obviously with no luck. Then He hears about this one guy who was a paraplegic who can now walk which to a sane person would sound like bologna. But he a gullible idiot and he falls for it and low and behold it's real, and he meets Crazy cancer lady who thinks she's Asian. Cancer lady tells him he must perceive beyond his senses not be limited by his thinking and more quoting Yoda and poof his hands are healed and he's the new sorcerer supreme. But he's now tasked with defeating Baron Mordo Evil black guy and Evil white guy played buy a terrible Swedish actor who may or may not be also white washing an Asian character. It's hard to say because not much was known about the character since he was a very minor character originally. But he likely wasn't Swedish with a name like kaecilius which sound Mediterranean, so I'll say Maddy Mickeymouse is also Playing a whitewashed character. Blah blah blah, he wants to take over the world by releasing an ancient fire monster because he's predictable and one dimensional like every other character in this overproduced CGI heap of garbage. Surprise Doctor Dullard beats Mad Mickey and Baron Blordo and saves the day, and now his butler is a terrible comic relief character. The End."

",-0.2263,-0.3775,2020-07-22 00:00:00,6,"While I was able to follow the general plot, this movie was confusing and a bit hard to follow. Below are my main critiques:1) Time travel is a massive plot hole. So Dr Strange can just rewind time anytime anything bad happens? Why not save everyone who died after the first two avengers movies, or in Civil War? Again, time travel is a huge plot whole.... 2) the Ancient One was taken down far too easily. It wasn't climactic enough... 3) the warping of NYC was meant to be cool, but I honestly found it to be over the top and incredibly confusing to follow (I felt the same after watching Inception)... 4) I still don't get the motivation behind Dormammu, who represents the Dark Dimension, to rule all the worlds including earth. Like, what does he do all day once he's ruled them?? I guess he's just really motivated by power, but he lacked depth. I also wasn't quite clear on why Kaecilius struck a deal with him. I know that Kaecilius didn't see eye to eye with the Ancient One, but how would Dormammu come across as more righteous??"

" Let's make Black Panther an old white lady next time...
",0.0,0.6994,2020-07-18 00:00:00,7,"Dr. Strange's origin story isn't cannon. He is able to defeat a master like Kaecilius and Kaecilius' students with ease despite only having been trained for a few weeks (Kaecilius kills several Sanctum masters and guardians, so Kaecilius is clearly incredibly powerful). So the plot/story isn't realistic, and the origin story isn't cannon. Ontop of that, they gender-bent the 2nd most important character in the movie, and they changed the race of the 3rd most important character in the movie from white to black... why don't we just make Black Panther white, and Iron Man black while we're at it? Why don't we change Black Widow from a sexy white woman to a 85year old man with a plastic hip? Why don't we change Wonder Woman from an amazonian goddess to a fat black man from Baltimore? Honestly, the movie should have -1 point deducted from my overall score simply because of the nonsense changes this director decided he wanted to do...Anyway, the movie is 75% plot/story, and 20% fighting, and 5% comedy. When you compare that to Thor Ragnarok or Deadpool, then you'll find that both those movies have a significantly larger amount of fighting AND comedy in them, without compromising on the story/plot. Overall, this film was let down by the director and the poor origin story. This movie only gets a 6.5/10."

",-0.2263,-0.842,2020-07-04 00:00:00,5,"This wasn't the superhero movie I was expecting, more training and mysticism than actual superhero origin or saving the day. Tons of trippy special effects, along the lines of Inception with shades of The Matrix thrown in. This does look good, it's visually dazzling, following a neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange as he seeks an otherworldly cure for a severe injury to his hands. In time his quest leads him to study the ancient art of sorcery from a mystic in Tibet known as the Ancient One.I'm a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and as expected he does a great job here, problem is I just hated his character, he's a dick; selfish, egotistical and I sure don't feel sorry for him or his mangled hands. I also didn't care for the American accent, even if it was perfect. Several vague characters in this, the bad guy (Mads Mikkelsen) is not fleshed out at all (what's his deal?) he's just a villain with cool eye makeup. Benedicts love interest Rachel McAdams is also wasted in a small nothing role, as well as being very excepting of Dr. Strange's turn of events when she finally sees him again as a separated spirit ghost person. I might have had a few questions like where have you been and WTH! The cloak was fun."

After a second rewatch and just seen Infinity War I changed it to a 9. Just watching it again a few years after Endgame it makes so much more sense and updated it to a 10. Everything seemed cleared to its ultimate goal and makes this a must rewatch and Dr strange taking a lead role for the avengers. Who else but Benedict could help fill the roll of Ironman. Unless he bring him back in the multiverse of madness. Mind blown :-).
" Marvel's magnificently mind-bending masterpiece!
",0.8687,0.997,2020-07-01 00:00:00,9,"I'm not the type of person who usually goes for fantasy films with magical elements in them, like the adaptations of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books or even Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. But there are a few exceptions here and there, like the case with Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven produced by B-movie king Roger Corman and staring Shakespearean actor Vincent Price (which is what Marvel's Doctor Strange reminds me of the most). All that being said though, I think this is the one to really get me hooked on the genre.The whole reason why I was intrigued to go see this in the first place was because I heard former critic C. Robert Cargill (I've always known him better by his alias as Carlyle, back in the day when he used to be a part of the Spill review crew) was going to be the one to write its screenplay, which got me really excited to see what he'd contribute to the film when adapting its comic book source material. The end result of his screenwriting effort was a pretty solid script which had some tight pacing, as the film never felt as if it was overstaying its welcome with unnecessary scenes of pointless filler padding out the runtime.I love the character arc Stephen Strange goes through (with terrific acting from Benedict Cumberbatch), as his character's growth consists of him changing from an arrogant, cynical Tony Stark-esque personality to a more humbled human being with a newfound, open-minded perspective on life after dealing with the trauma of his near-fatal car crash. At the very heart of it all, this film's intimate story is about a man whose career of being a genius neurosurgeon has come to an untimely end and thinks his life is now completely devoid of any purpose because it's all he's ever known when in actuality, there's a new way for him to still have a meaningful life and help people again by becoming a larger-than-life superhero, selflessly thinking about the wellbeing of others (it's quite profound stuff, when you really get down to thinking about it. Definitely something I can partially relate to). It almost seems like a bold move on the filmmakers' part to have their leading star be a somewhat unlikable, stubborn know-it-all who's a bit of a jerk.As the same with all Marvel's films, they always get a veteran actor for a prominent role. For Ant-Man (2015), it's Michael Douglas. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), it was Kurt Russell. With this, it's the always brilliant Tilda Swinton playing the wise Sorcerer Supreme herself, the Ancient One. In fact, all the pivotal cast members gave spellbindingly good performances: from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Strange's mentoring magic-practicer who judges his every decision, to Rachel McAdams as Strange's old flame who harbours a great deal resentment towards his ungratefulness attitude. Mads Mikkelsen's Kaecilius isn't really all that much more than a herald for Dormammu's arrival, but at least he's got himself a clear goal that he's working towards obtaining.I have a particular fondness for this Marvel movie, as it goes against the many conventions of what a standard MCU film entails and actually takes some risks by mixing up the formula of a fairly straight-forward superhero movie as we know them today. Whereas there'd typically be the remnants of a destroyed city during the spectacular end battle, they manage to avoid that cliched trope by putting one back together again. Instead of physically challenging the big-baddie villain in a one-on-one punch-up fist fight, he uses a clever little trick he learnt earlier on in the film's duration to help him gain the upper hand over his malevolent opponent, thus achieving his nonviolent preference as the pacifistic Master of the Mystic Arts (now that's what I'd call a new take on the ""setup and payoff"" in action films).To put it simply, this movie is a marvellous display of eye-candy that's filled to the brim with all kinds of trippy, psychedelic imagery which is certain to blow your mind away! (It's just a real shame I never got the chance to see this the way it was meant to be seen in IMAX 3D, so then I could've properly taken in and appreciated the stunningly intricate visuals that showcased its brightly-lit colour palette). With all the creatively off-the-wall fight scenes, it's obvious they wanted to emulate the ascetic of an old-fashioned wizard's duel, capturing the look and feel of something like Vincent Price and Boris Karloff's famous confrontation in The Raven (1963). Also, can't forget about the wondrously enchanting musical score composed by Michael Giacchino that replicates the same style of synth music which a lot of those older, sword-and-sorcery dark fantasies had back in the '80s.For many personal reasons, Doctor Strange may in fact be my favourite Marvel movie of them all for its innovative way of retelling the same old worn-out, tired superhero origin story by putting a fresh spin on all the combining factors that go into making it. Simply revolutionary."

We have some power, ego and responsibility dilemmas, teacher-student relationships and I cant stress enough how much work went into visuals. But Doctor Strange has its downsides also.

This makes it very hard to rank this film in my Marvel list.The obvious MVP here is the VFX team, who did a spectacular job making this magical world come to life. The action sequences are honestly some of the best of any MCU movie. Also, the performances are spot-on : Benedict Cumberbatch kills it as Stephen Strange, and the other cast members play their roles to near-perfection. I would complain, however, that the pacing is an element that could have been improved, especially in the first act when they set up Strange's character a little bit too quickly for my personal taste.However, Doctor Strange is another amazing addition to Marvel's stacked lineup, and I can't wait to see what Sam Raimi will do with the sequel in 2022."

The writers have a decent stab at giving our protagonist an interesting character arc, and as far as Marvel films go I'd say Stephen Strange has more development of character than anyone. Cumberbatch is cast perfectly - I wouldn't be surprised to find out the role was written with him in mind.What lets the film down is once again a weak antagonist - ""Dormammu"", an ambiguous being with a seemingly motiveless intent on destroying the planet. Sounds familiar right? I'm losing track of the number of Marvel films that follow this same lazy bad guy formula. It weakens the plot drastically every time, which in the case of Doctor Strange is already barely holding water.I'm not a fan of many films that attempt plot lines experimenting in time travel - it is too easy to pick holes in and too difficult to accept events. For instance, why does Doctor Strange wait until the end of the film to use his time reversal powers?? Why not use them at any other point in the story to resolve matters?? There are no answers to these questions, and along with many other movies that allow their plots to fall into the time travel trap, it makes for weak viewing.If it weren't for the outstanding visual effects (which are so good they give Inception a run for its money) then I think I would've rated Doctor Strange one or two stars less. Overall though, while not my favourite instalment in the MCU, it is a worthwhile watch and leaves us with the potential for a promising sequel. 7/10."

The master of magic's who save the world from the accidents, enemy of the multiverse as per comics. Who can control one of the most precious infinity stone i.e. Time Stone. For these reason he became more powerful super hero.
We all know that marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe is occupy a large number of fanbase. Doctor Strange is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . The film was directed by Scott Derrickson from a screenplay he wrote with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as surgeon Stephen Strange along with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Benjamin Bratt, Scott Adkins, Mads Mikkelsen, and Tilda Swinton. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.
If we see the plot of movie , In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant
Neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car crash, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who Mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange,
Revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. The actual movie starts from here; in between this plot we all notice that Dr strange is the owner of a well sharp mind. So he quickly learns the mystic arts. As we concentrate in the dialog of the movie each and every dialogs are very powerful and meaningful also. The ancient one's dialog on the Dr strange give up the ego and saw the entire world how world is actual in nature. One of the best dialog in movie in my view is- ""who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange?"" by the ancient one. And another most precious dialog is ""We never lose our demons, Mordo we only learn to live above them."" To Mordo who is master of mystic art and martial art also and trained it to Dr strange.
In graphics quality and screenplay and CGI effect is top class. And movie is ending by MCU in it's own style. We get two mid credits scenes where, Strange decides to help Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to Earth to search for their father, Odin.In a post credits scene, Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses to walk, telling him that Earth has ""too many sorcerers"".
To get rate on movie I gave 10 on 10 as a marvel fan and also for this beautiful movie. I recoment you to see this beautiful movies. I told that you my fall in love with marvel comics and MCU movie creating style. And the last word from me ""iss aanaat bhramvand me tum kon ho review parne wale?"". HE HE. Just watch the movie."
" Lives up to its name... strange
",-0.2023,0.9371,2020-04-22 00:00:00,6,"This is a weird film. It sits right in the middle of an ongoing MCU but feels like it shouldn't really be there. It's visually stunning and the effects are great but it lacks everywhere else for me. I watched it right through because it's part of the MCU but had I not bothered with it, I wouldn't really have noticed."
" From the beginning I want this condescending prick to die...
",-0.2732,0.775,2020-04-22 00:00:00,5,I love Marvel movies... But this one feels too much like the Matrix. I'll update this review if my feelings change towards the end but I don't know if I'll make it there.
" Very good story
",0.4927,0.8168,2020-04-08 00:00:00,9,"The story and visual effects are really good, Benedict Cumberbatch was a good choice for the character. But the ending isn't so good as I expected."
" Marvel have found a way to keep their movies new and fresh again!
",0.6588,0.9908,2020-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Doctor Strange was a very unique in its style, and the powers available for the heroes. Marvel did a great job of moving the buildings in ways unlike any other movie I'd seen, other than Inception, I think Marvel did it even better. The ways the characters could run sideways along rooms or buildings, as well as jumping through time holes into new areas.The development of Strange's character was well done. His arrogance is constantly being broken down scene after scene until he finally relents and realises that its not about him.The CGI and camerwork was excellent. The cape that flies onto Doctor Strange was even humourous. They were able to make an inatimate object seem alive and interesting.It was great to finally have some settings outside of London and New York. Being in Kathmandu, Nepal was refreshing. It's arrogant to think that time and time again that Superheroes would only ever be found in USA or UK. Super hero movies are more often than not set in these western settings.The Eastern setting was a welcome change and the new cast was quirky and intriguing. Benedict Wong was funny and added a lot to the overall feel over the movie.The casting of Rachel McAdams felt like Marvel just trying their hardest to try and get as many famous actors involved in the MCU as possible. She was a key actor and did really well. But she could've equally been an actor that was not as well known. Movie after movie, it seems like they have a man as the main superhero and then try to have an attractive, famous supporting actress to try and get more ratings.Overall a much bigger improvement from some of the earlier movies in the Marvel universe. Doctor Strange easily becomes one of my favourite superheroes and he is full of dominating power. His story also advances the overall story with the inclusion of the infinity stone."
" ""Strange"" concept pays off well
",0.2732,0.9907,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"This was amazing!!!! I went into this movie knowing nothing about the character. I kept myself completely in the dark. No comics, no animated movies, staying off Thursday night. Glad I did. There were tons of moments that wowed and surprised me, that I don't think would have had as big of an impact if I had read the source material beforehand. It was like putting Jedi in the movie ""The Matrix."" The visuals are so mind-bending that this is one of the very few times I would say go see it in 3D. (Unless you get headaches easily or suffer from motion sickness. Then stick with the standard version). The 3D is more than worth the extra price. The opening seen alone already feels like it was worth every penny. The movie is also very deep and thought provoking. ""Civil War"" was thought-provoking in a political way, and this is thought provoking in a science/psychological way. Benedict Cumberbaych does amazingly as always, but I do feel like he was typecast. He seems to be playing the ""I'm smarter than you and I'm going to let you know I'm smarter than you every chance I get"" character over and over. I'm worried he'll become like Johnny Depp and end up eventually becoming a parody of himself. I don't want to spoil anything, because like I said before, it's better to go in knowing nothing. I will say that I hope Marvel takes more risks with more obscure characters and that Fox finally stops being selfish and just gives them the rights to ""X-Men"" and ""Fantastic Four"" already! I want to see Tony Stark, Stephen Strange, Bruce Banner, Hank Pym, and Reed Richards have a science debate. Just make one big banter-fest movie of these characters. Just witty back and forth dialogue between them. That would be awesome! I'm excited to see how this movie ties in to ""Infinity War."" Definitely looking forward to seeing Doctor Strange appear in future movies.
Grade: A- 9/10. 4/5 stars"
" Really hits the mark.
",0.0,0.9164,2020-03-28 00:00:00,9,Dr Strange is truly a cinematic treat. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a cool an fun Dr Strange and does not disappoint. The CGI is used very well in this film with its visuals and sets up a fun flick. The villain is kind of stock though and not much development goes into him sadly. The secondary characters are solid too like Mordo and the Ancient one. The story has problems but few and far between. A really great superhero film.
" excellent

The character build up is very powerful, why a scientist who does not believe in fantasy can become a brain magic wizard, and this psychological transformation process is convincing. The lines are great. They explain a lot of philosophical ideas behind the scenes without humor. I come to bargain !!!"

It was part of the scene from Thor: Ragnarok.Doctor Strange fighting with Kaecilius along with the other two with him was pretty cool.It is worth the watch. Plus, before you watch Endgame, you also have to watch this to know what was going on in Endgame, when they were time traveling."
" It ok
",0.296,0.3506,2020-03-11 00:00:00,7,"Comedy good and the actors are great but something missing, I just don't know?"
" The film brings elements that significantly expand the Marvel universe: magic, mystical objects or even upside-down action scenes in impossible scenarios
",0.6249,0.8195,2020-03-08 00:00:00,8,"After some continuations of the universe, Marvel presents another of its main characters, making room this time for the exploration of the mystical world. Created by designer Steve Ditko and screenwriter Stan Lee, the character first appeared in Strange Tales # 110 (July 1963). Just like in the comics, in this movie adaptation, Stephen is described as a brilliant and selfish surgeon. After a car accident that severely damages his hands and hinders his ability to perform surgery, he travels the world until he reaches a place found between the mountains of Nepal, the Kamar-Taj, where he meets the Elder. After becoming one of the former students of the Supreme Wizard, he begins training in both the mystical and martial arts to become the Supreme Wizard of the Earth.Directed by Scott Derrickson, known for directing horror films, such as ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)"", The Entity (2012) ""and Deliver Us from Evil (2014)"", Marvel takes a risk by addressing a different theme and give a darker tone to your universe, with magicians, sorcerers, manipulation of matter, and mental powers like telepathy, telekinesis. And the director knows very well how to create a more serious atmosphere, of characters tormented by mortality.Starring Benedict Cumberbatch in the main role, the actor knows exactly how to show his main characteristics in a masterful way, especially in the first act of the feature, before he was introduced to the mystical world. The entire transformation of Stephen is shown in an interesting way, which begins the projection by emphasizing his narcissistic and arrogant side and at the same time his genius in the profession. Shortly after the car accident and all failed recovery attempts, upon hearing a tip from an acquaintance he considered intractable in the past and who healed in Kamar-Taj, he begins his journey of transformation. What appeared to be the end was just the beginning. From then on, the film follows a standard formula and has already been repeated several times: the student, the master, the villain who turned against the master, the phase of self-discovery, training and the climax of the story. Even though it is repetitive, as it is a history of origin, the formula is understandable.A skeptic who believes only in science, when he arrives on the scene imagining himself to be an unattended medical board, Stephen soon discovers that it is about something else, ""reorienting the spirit"" to better heal the body, mysteries that exist outside the senses, worlds without end, some benevolent to life and others dark, where powers older than time lurk thirsty and anxious. Dr. Strenge goes on to try to find out who he is in this multiverse. The training he goes through is thought provoking to the public, in which he will have to silence his ego for his power to emerge. These are sequences that, in addition to showing the training, present more about the past of the villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), about relics such as the Rod of the Living Court, the Access Rings to other worlds, the Mirrored Dimension, the Eye of Agamotto, the Mantle from Levitation, the Black Dimension where Dormammu lives - the destroyer of worlds, the Sanctums of power created by Agamotto that protect the world and the magicians that protect the Sanctums from beings from another dimension that protect our universe.From there the plot takes us to the attempts to destroy the Sanctums and the entrance of Black Magic, travels between worlds, epic confrontations in scenarios thought to the millimeter. The visual effects of the feature are exquisite, helping a lot to present this world of magic. There are many scenes made entirely in computer graphics and that do not let us notice any artificiality at any time. The scenes are psychedelic, frantic and impressively ingenious. The dynamics of all the action through the exchange of dimensions through the portals is done with extreme originality. No wonder, it is one of the favorite productions to give an Oscar to Marvel in this category. Ben Davis' photography mixes daytime and nighttime scenes exploring and offering different possibilities to the direction. A curiosity is that the scenes that take place in the streets of London are very reminiscent of the photograph used in another film that involves magic, in the case ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"". Michael Giacchino's soundtrack also sets the story in a slightly darker and more mysterious mood.As for the rest of the cast, we can highlight the always beautiful Rachel McAdams. More than a doctor's romantic interest, Christine Palmer is one of the doctor's connections with the material dimension and is one of the few people who sees Strange apart from his so inflated persona of the ""legendary surgeon"", and this is well explored in several scenes that help to humanize the doctor. Tilda Swinton, playing the Elder, also does very well as the master of our doctor, being a key player in the plot. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Mordo) as one of the grandmaster's students and Benedict Wong (Wong) as the comic relief for the production's rarest scenes of humor. The film's weak point is the villain Kaecilius, who does not prove to be a real threat. It is more a puppet than an antagonist. We don't feel a real threat when we see it, and that adds some of the strength of the final stretch of production, which is resolved in a simpler way. A waste of the excellent Mads Mikkelsen.Scott Derrickson knew how to command a story with many interesting elements that significantly expand the Marvel universe. It's all very well balanced: magic, mystical objects or even upside-down action scenes in impossible scenarios, within the context of the film and of parallel dimensions, seem even more natural than a Captain frozen for 70 years defeating villains with a Vibranium shield . The story focuses on the presentation of Dr. Strange's universe and only briefly quotes The Avengers. A more direct link to the Marvel universe can be seen in a post-credit scene. Some tips are loose for future sequels and just imagining what this world of wizards / wizards has to offer in future films, the expectation only grows."
" Great
",0.6249,0.8947,2020-02-24 00:00:00,9,"I was not prepared for the visuals this movie offered. Nevertheless, I absorbed it in its full glory. It was easy to enjoy this movie not only because of its visuals but also because of the quirkiness and lovable characters. A must-watch!"
" Dr Strange
",-0.2023,0.9202,2020-02-19 00:00:00,9,This movie was totally bizarre filled with a lot of Supernatural stuff that I really got into on a great special effects definitely worth the watch if you're into the Marvel series like I am
" I was relieved when the rushed, stiff and cliche Batman Begins-lite, Eat Pray Love opening of Doctor Strange...
",0.8442,0.9965,2020-02-18 00:00:00,6,"...gave way to a joyous, refreshingly creative, kinetic visual treat with some superb flourishes of VFX and some snappy dialogue moments even if they are all lifted from the How-To Guide for Marvel Superhero Movies(tm).The (highly underrated) Scott Derrickson, director of modern horror masterpiece, Sinister, shoots confidently, and despite the palpably brisk pace hopping over lots of obvious scene trimmings; the film moves from whizz-bang locale to genuinely interesting introspective scenes with aplomb.Derrickson knows how to take and distill the influences of comic books and videogames and build something less like Inception, and more like Ninja Theory's DMC game; fight scenes take place in the mirror world; a beautiful kaleidoscope of flowers and rocks and exploding, bleeding plateaus like an Arkham City battle arena. Weapons imbued with magic and a cape to rival Aladdin's Carpet (sure to be used more in the next instalment) all of them designed straight from sub-culture inspirations like Final Fantasy. That stop-motion-esque scene with that apple is bloody fantastic.The sparse but excellent cast and the very clearly defined globetrotting locations mean that the film can look rich and uniquely designed with tremedous costume and make-up work, great lore and contained moments without inflating the budget. It's a smart move, worked on by talented collaborative team in the early stages with the freedom to create something cohesive.When Strange uses time to defeat a timeless being it's a little bit clever, a lot bit beautiful and pleasurable on the whole. Unlike recent blockbusters (I'm looking at you Ghost in the Shell) the themes are seeded well, consistent and clear and the film doesn't rely on crappy opening descriptive text for idiots or stupid generic ending voice over to cap it off because of confusion.The only disappointing beat is Chiwetel Ejiofor's unearned and misguided post-credits turn to the dark side. But that said, Doctor Strange is the little film that could; like Iron Man and Thor before it. Let's just hope the same team can build upon the foundations and expand all of the little moments and doesn't end up an Iron Man 2 or a Thor Dark World."
" The way they use magic for fights is where the unique nature of this film lies.
",-0.6705,0.8271,2020-02-17 00:00:00,8,"Cumberbatch, both a natural comedian and a subtle one, knows how to get a big laugh from nothing more than an arched eyebrow."
" good for insomnia
",0.4404,0.2486,2020-02-12 00:00:00,3,"I'll just say what is on my mind after watching the movie for maybe the fifth time. I'm tired of Hollywood hiring foreigners to do an American accent. It's just a lot of hard R's. Either base him in London and let him keep his natural voice or hire a real American.The biggest thing that nagged me was the writing that dated the movie. When he starts listing off one-named musicians (that a 45 year old British guy wouldn't/shouldn't listen to) it sounds weird. It also wasn't a funny bit. It was just weird. I'd rather him stick with liking music for his age -like a normal person would. Besides, 50 years from now grandkids will ask if that was a joke and no one will know. ""Well, at the time he was a British guy (pretending to be American) a decade older than me talking about musicians American kids 20 years younger than me would listen to. It was a dad joke I guess?""The whole time bending, multiverse thing is blah.I couldn't see kids get behind this as a superhero and I, as an adult, think it's good for making me sleepy."
" The most visually pleasing MCU movie
",0.5688,0.8588,2020-02-09 00:00:00,7,"Unlike the Star Wars Disney movies, I feel like there is actually some heart put into these movies. While I may be wrong saying that, at least these movies are mostly good and entertaining. Doctor strange has yet another great cast of actors with Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, Mads Mikkelsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and Rachel McAdams. It has a pretty iconic end fight scene which is odd for Marvel movies. I'd say the end fight scene in this was better than the one in End Game overall. This was more creative than a bunch of people punching each other."
" Smart, Emotional, Visually Stunning Expiriance.
",0.7096,0.9807,2020-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. my most watched marvel movie after the avengers saga.Its funny at parts, with smart dialogs, and i find the lead actors performances to be very relatable. great music and just amazing visuals that are the most creative use of CGI i got to see in recent years.For some reason my friends didn't enjoy it as much as i did, but i guess its a matter a taste and personal preferences.I highly recommend watching it, especially if you like the marvel style of film-making and are already a fan of the genre."
" Not strange at all
",0.1511,0.8658,2020-02-03 00:00:00,5,"Doctor strange follows the same template of ironman- a wealthy, successful but arrogant person turning into a selfless hero. There is lack of humor, no fun, weak villain(as usual) and zero chemistry between cumberbatch and McAdams. The scene where strange bids goodbye to Jean and she kissing him on his cheek instead of lips shows their lack of chemistry. On the other hand, good things of the film is the end where strange traps doramammu, graphics and tilda swintons performance. I rewatch many marvel films but not Dr strange. Still he was very good in infinity war."

There is no time lapse of him failing and trying. 1 second he is doing surgery next second he is the best scorcerer ever.He fights the villains in boring fight scenes.This is what the mcu Is about. Little story and clich√© fights.I gave it an 8 only because during 2009 to 2019 I was under the mcu spell. Dr. Strange is 3.5 at best.

he looks to alternative ways to deal so he hears of a place in the asia in search of answers but instead discovers the mystical arts and becomes a powerful sorcery battling dark forces bents on destroying our reality the visual effects are outstanding like the leo di caprio film inceptions were everything bends causing quite unusually chases which are unique . i cant wait for him in the avengers films there was a lot of dry wit and off character humor. his clock is cool and he has to defend four realms on earth. like hong kong new York and London. great 8/10 and 1hr50 mins is just perfect just saw it on dvd great addition to the marvel universe enjoy."

",-0.3412,0.9849,2020-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Not the strongest origin story in the MCU, maybe because Stephen Strange in not one of the most likable characters in the franchise. The villain played by Mads Mikkelsen is interesting, but does not get the screen time it deserves - a problem that many Marvel flicks share. I would still say that the movie delivers in most departments. Special effects are spectacular, if not groundbreaking. Dialog is well written, the action sequences fun and the pace of the movie keeps the audience interested throughout. I must also give extra credit for Marvel Studios for using the beautiful filming locations in Nepal. Looking forward to the future adventures of Doctor Strange, now that the origin story is out of the way."

The struggles he faced weren't presented up to the mark (I mean that could've been a point where people would give into the character) and he was distracted from his motto (getting his hand better and normal) many times for such a passionate human leading a normal life.

" A remake of Iron Man
",0.0,0.9972,2019-11-25 00:00:00,7,"A brilliant man of science gets injured and works with an individual from the east to rediscover his purpose, eventually fighting an enemy with similar powers in a city. But enough about Iron Man.I know I'm in a minority on this, but Doctor Strange tells a similar story to, but is superior to, Iron Man in just about every way.Doctor Strange is a brilliant neurosurgeon with a photographic memory who gets into a car accident due to his own negligence that robs him the use of his hands in any effective way. He goes from performing some of the most intricate surgeries modern science is called upon to accomplish to being unable to shave himself because his hands won't stop shaking. Giving up on western medical solutions, he follows rumors to Tibet where he meets the Ancient One and a monastery of monks dedicated to magic. Opening his eyes to the world beyond the physical, Strange uses his mental strength to quickly become a star pupil, going beyond the proscribed limits of his training, and meeting an evil former student out to bring about the end of the order and the current state of the world in favor of a being from the Dark Dimension.What mainly makes this movie work is the strong and simple character journey Doctor Strange finds himself on. It's beyond an arrogant man learning a bit of humility. It's the story of a man with a limited view of the world learning to expand it, while also realizing his size in the face of such enormity. He may have been the best neurosurgeon (partially because he only chose savable patients), and he may have become one of the premier masters of the magical arts, but he has come to realize how small he is. Despite the great things he does to save the planet, he knows that there are more things out there that he won't be able to face down alone. It's a strongly written emotional arc for a main character that connects from piece to piece very well.Of course, the main positive of the film is the action and special effects. Marvel movies have a tendency towards a drab color palette and shaky cam action (which is sometimes appropriate like in the Captain America sequels that imply a sense of urgency and reality to the action). However, that approach isn't always appropriate like in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies and this one. The idea behind the film is a gobbledygook idea of a multiverse, bringing in the powers of other universes using magical spells, and then shattering reality in certain ways with that. That very idea lends itself to trippy visuals that the movie embraces fully.From the spectral form of Doctor Strange helping with a surgery on his own body to the show stopping chase through New York's mirror dimension, the movie embraces an inventive mode of special effects that lends itself well to the material. Watching New York's skyscrapers fold in on themselves, creating different axes of dimensionality, is just fun to take in, and the action that runs through it is inventive and fun.Another note needs to be given to the resolution to the film's climax. The giant cloud monster from the Dark Dimension has entered our realm through a portal in Hong Kong. Dr. Strange uses some time magic to draw things backwards and then launch himself directly into the Dark Dimension to face the monster. Instead of some special effects knock out, drag out fight, we get Dr. Strange attacking the problem with intelligence and wit. He can't beat this giant monster. In fact, we watch the monster kill Dr. Strange repeatedly as the good doctor puts time into a loop that neither he nor the monster can escape. Dr. Strange is happy to maintain this status quo as long as it keeps Earth safe, but the monster needs to escape, leaving an implied agreement that we see the end of.The movie's a strong entertainment and fun. A good, mid-cycle addition to the whole universe."

Also all the characters have a positive and negative aspects to their personality which makes it a whole lot more relevant. The last thing I'd like to praise is the use of time travel and manipulation. It has been so long since someone has done something new and exciting with it. The idea of defeating the undefeatable via trapping him in time loop was brilliant. Also the action sequences where time was travelling backwards yet the lead characters were still going forward we're really creative and fun.

It should've had at least a 3hr runtime because its all sorcery, magical stuff which would take us some time to understand. Many would've or might want to see this one because the storyline continues along with all the other marvel movies or excited to see Cumberbatch in action. Mine was, more of Cumberbatch.

The fact that they cast a bald white woman as the ancient one is honestly a slap in the face to fans of Marvel. You really don't even have to have read the comics to know that the ancient one is Chinese or Asian. He's an old Asian man, not some young looking white woman who just so happens to be bald and Celtic to boot. I did like this movie, and still do like a lot of parts of it, but honestly dormammu is one of the most boring, dull and stupid villains that Marvel has ever made, and, and I think this is the funniest part out of this entire film, there's the fact that they recycled thanos's face and used that as the basis for dormammu. How lazy and stupid can you possibly be? Also how stupid do you think your fanbase is? Pretty pathetic and sad."

",0.2382,0.9989,2019-07-28 00:00:00,7,"Wealth, Arrogance, Loss, suffering then redemption. It's marvel studios winning formula that brought you the first Iron Man film. This film is marvels second shot at this arc and they really seem to make it work.The CGI scenes were actually good which was one of my biggest fears going in to this film. The acting is good as Ben Cumbie (never saying that again don't worry) does an amazing job. It's the supporting cast that usually drag down marvel films but in this one they really seem to do great, Tilda Swinton and the dude who plays Mordo are great. If you have any criticisms about Rachel Mcadams acting please just watch the scene where the broom falls in the closet. That is genuine fear. That is good acting.
The whole trippy CGI thing is absolutely brilliant and won't age that badly, but the best part of the film is the score. Sure the story and acting is good and the shots are all fine but the score is just magnificent. Listen to a track called ""the hands dealt"" and you will find yourself loving this film more and more.
The best way to describe this film is as a cross between Kung-Fu Panda and Iron Man 1.
Unfortunately the villain of the film really lets it down as their performance is great and the reason they have for conflict is presented in a somewhat interesting way but I just feel like it was lacking something. A little more character development wouldn't go a miss.
The connection between Christine and stevie strange (sorry) is actually really good. There are whole plots that feel like they could go some where that just don't. It's both great and terrible.
The most important part of this film is that it is a great standalone. It has Easter eggs to the MCU but it never depends on another film to do anything. That is important as it means this film proves it can get by on its own.
This film is clever and serious when it wants but has the charm of the silly and stupid films we have come to love from marvel. It succeeds in telling a compelling story and the acting cinematography is generally great. It still has flaws and those flaws are oh too apparent. It is still entertaining and even tho it's not a perfect film in anyway it is defiantly worth watching at least twice.7/10 - Master of the mystic farts"

You feel the pain and desperation of his character and wants him to succeed by the end. The final act is a great change of pace too. Can be a bit too similar to Iron man in direct story and definitely is more of an MCU formula film but none the less is still a great movie due to Cumberbatch and his portrayal of Strange's great arc.

",0.8655,0.9928,2019-06-13 00:00:00,10,"While Doctor Strange is mainly an action film with great action scenes and visual effects, it also has powerful dialogues and strong performances that add to the quality of storytelling.The visual effects are the first thing one would remember this film for. I mean, I still can't understand how could one imagine something as creatively complex as this. As the viewer sits and experiences the action sequences filled with mind-bending effects and creativity, one can't help but feel it's one of the greatest visual spectacles of all time.But as said before, there's a heart to the storytelling apart from all the non-stop action. Ancient One's dialogues are sharp and deep at the same time. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as an arrogant doctor who goes on to become one of the most powerful superheroes, or the ""Master of the Mystic Arts"" as he is called, is nothing but outstanding. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One is really impressive. Other actors are also impressive, including Rachel McAdams who plays more than just the hero's love interest, and Benedict Wong who just like his name lives up to the character of Wong.The film depicts what a superhero should be, without even mentioning it verbally even once. It's extremely impressive to see Strange bond with the Cloak and fight the bad guys. It's almost like a martial arts film, where a lost man seeks knowledge and becomes a protector, but it's really different from what any viewer would have seen in any other superhero blockbuster. The irreverent humor also works well wherever placed.Doctor Strange is one of the best action movies ever made, and with its outstanding visual effects along with the action sequences, is purely an experience of a lifetime.

Benedict Cumberbatch was a great choice. He portrays Doctor Strange as calm and intelligent (like a surgeon) while also arrogant and self-absorbed. The development of Strange's character is one that is classic but well done, moving from a Tony Stark narcissist to a just protector of Earth. Rachel McAdams helps to balance the plot between the mystical and real. The whole movie constructs a really interesting conflicting narrative between science and belief, and how people can learn to have both.

",0.5974,0.9476,2019-04-27 00:00:00,6,"Doctor Strange was one of the movie that made me drop my jaw so bad that I couldn't take my eyes of it. I was glad to be a member of IMDb and I wanted to share my opinion about Doctor Strange.
The movie casted Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Stephen Strange, Benedict Wong as Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo, Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One. In my opinion, the acting was quite good, they embodied the characters they were set to play, not just be the character. Cumberbatch did really well being the Wizard and Swinton as the Ancient One, she was on fire! The villains Kaecilius and Dormammu are acted really well, considered as one of the best villains of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The story was really good: a doctor crashed in a car and when he recovered, he was sent to Nepal to train mystic arts. It was 9% boring to me and it was kinda corny!
I've gotta say, the fight scenes were really EPIC and so were the CGI effects. They were better than Inception (2010). The city moved like a puzzle and characters fought upside down, which was one of my favourite MCU showdowns. But unfortunately, it wasn't how I expected it to be. It didn't win the best Visual Effects but overshadowed by The Jungle Book. That was really unfair, they only did animals talking and nice jungle views but if I was the one to choose the winner, I would definately choose Doctor Strange for its CGI and other special effects. The were jaw-dropping and of course, extremely mind-blowing! That's why I couldn't take my eyes off. The mystic arts KILLED it!
Many scenes were quite unforgettable like when Mordo gave Strange a paper and he thought it was something about mystic arts but it turned out to be a Wi-fi password! I couldn't help myself laughing.
I wasn't sleepy or bored but I was watching this at midnight and I just kept praising the movie for its good actions and VFX. I went like ""Wow!"", ""Awesome!"". My eyes were wide!
To rate this movie, I gave it a 8.6 out of 10. It was quite a BLAST, mostly unforgettable and one of the best of MCU"

Steven Strange is a well fleshed out character with a really good character arc.
We get to se him being an a hole to slowly developing into being a true hero.
You could say that the story is formulaic and all but i didn't really mind it that much (and yes it's a minor flaw that it's formulaic) and they managed to also make a few other characters interesting.
Ancient one is a interesting character.
I though she would be that flawless person that dies near the end of the movie but they showed that she has flaws and that nobody is perfect which is a great addition which strengthens the movie.
And the other guy with sword (i forgot his name) was also an interesting character who left Strange and Wong in the end which was an interesting scene.VILLAIN
The villain was terrible one of the worst marvel villain to be ever created and that's why i gave this movie an 8/10 instead of a 9/10.ACTION
I lacked how they had interesting areas to do the fight scenes even though they weren't that amazingly well choreographed.FINAL ACT
The final act was underwhelming.
They had an interesting place to do an action scene but because of the mediocre choreography the action wasn't really that interesting and it ended pretty short.VERDICT
I really like the movie.FINAL WORD
I promised myself to watch as many marvel movies and review them so i will be prepared for endgame.
I'll probably watch.
Civil war.

Mads Mikkelseb and Tilda Swinton are both fine whilst Rachel McAdams is a tad under used, Benedict Wong is a joy.I'm not sure I understood everything that was going on, but the effects are great, and I really enjoyed the score too. Outside of the Avengers theme, I can't think of another theme to a Marvel movie.

" Fresher than most
",0.0,0.8152,2019-04-21 00:00:00,7,"The latest Marvel superhero origin tale, this explores the character of Stephen Strange, a neurosurgeon who loses his dexterity in a horrific car accident. He travels to Kathmandu in order to train spiritually in an attempt to fix his broken body, but instead he finds himself joining an order of mystic monks in their battle against a renegade. DOCTOR STRANGE stands out from the overcrowded market thanks to the emphasis on astral projection and spirituality, which I found generally interesting. Cumberbatch is a likeable hero and the supporting cast much better than usual for this kind of film, with Mads Mikkelsen standing out as villain. The film is inevitably dominated by CGI action but it feels fresher here than most, and it generally stays character-focused to keep the viewer involved."
" Nearly two hours of mindless CGI
",-0.4404,0.9517,2019-04-20 00:00:00,2,"I must confess that superhero films do not have me jumping up and down with excitement as they appear to be aimed at twelve-year-olds and those who need to see non-stop explosions and destruction to hold their attention. The first Batman with Nicholson was entertaining and funny, even the original Superman films had reasonable plots and enterainment value but Marvel and DC took the whole genre in a new direction As time has gone by, each successive superhero film reduces the human element while increasing the special effects and CGI. Doctor Strange has taken all this to a new level - I doubt if more than five minutes were filmed without using blue screens. It's sad to see the film industry deteriorate to the level where garbage like this draws huge box-office, encouraging more of the same trash to be produced. Hollywood's obsession with PC plotting and characters has lowered standards even further. The few intelligent films being produced for audiences prepared to follow a character-driven plot struggle to make a profit so we appear to be stuck with superheroes for the foreseeable future."

It has similarities (super ego, millionaire, best at his job, ultra smart), but the personalities are clearly different. Also, Benedict Cumberbatch seems to enjoy the dumb comic-book world. The story is another Marvel Origin superhero and ""it works"", barely.Now the bad. The jokes do not work, for the most part. The villain is underused and weak. The story already done with Thor (humility and being worthy) in the same MCU, which makes it even less original because it has a similar tone and feel. The powers aren't well explained at all. There are some major dumb things, like the prohibited books section and whatnot.Having said that, the action is fun and different because of the kind of powers Strange has. Also the discussion of the ""Chosen One"" and ""breaking the laws of nature"" and the moral conundrum of using power ""from the Dark Dimension"" and the extent of its use to protect the Earth, etc, is pretty interesting (although again, cut by the Marvel light-hearted formula, it's not the most profound discussion of such things with a conclusion that says: its good when the hero does it). The ""final boss"" villain was defeated in a very original and smart way, and that was great too.Good movie, with potential for much more, imprisoned in the good not great Marvel Formula."

When you take away a base line of reality, the whole universe has no stability or consequences, thus no dread, thus no failure. It's like with Doctor Who, if the sonic screwdriver can diagnose and remedy any problem, there is no adventure. This movie lies too close to that edge. I also felt the horizon shifting contortions were too abstract to imply real danger so the action became hollow for me. Although I give it points for CGI concepts and executions. There were excellent performances, Benedict Cumberbatch (with a flawless North American accent, no less) and Tilda Swinton are excellent performers and Rachel MacAdams can ring romance out of a dish cloth.

" A visually dazzling stepping stone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
",0.4215,0.9923,2019-03-08 00:00:00,7,"See if you can guess this movie: goatee'd egomaniac finds himself in a life-changing situation in a foreign land that makes him question everything he's ever stood for and become a superhero in the process. If you guessed Iron Man (2008), you'd certainly be close. No, this familiar plot is none other than the visually extreme Doctor Strange. I understand Marvel has a bigger plot in mind when they do these lesser-known heroes; but lately, it almost seems like they're just phoning it in. Doctor Strange merely feels like filler to get to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Avengers: Infinity War (2018).I will give Marvel this much: they do know how to cast a film. Benedict Cumberbatch does a superb job at portraying the eponymous Dr. Strange, fused with enough gravitas and humor to make watching him a joy. And while many will question Tilda Swinton's role as The Ancient One, especially considering the amount of Eastern mysticism included in the film's theology, she certainly makes the role work in her own way. Even the sentient cape he wears has a personality I haven't seen since the flying carpet in Aladdin (1992).What Doctor Strange lacks in plot, it makes up for in special effects. I'm almost glad I didn't see this in 3-D, as I'm sure I would have vomited from all the swirling kaleidoscope effects seen throughout. Clearly, even though it's six years later, Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010) made an impression on the film world when it comes to these reality-distorting effects. There were even moments where I could catch the influence of The Matrix (1999) on the special effects of this film, especially when the characters decided that gravity wasn't good enough for them. Despite all this, even though I wasn't high enough to fully enjoy some of the sequences, Doctor Strange was still an entertaining film.A visually dazzling stepping stone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I give Doctor Strange 3.5 stars out of 5."

I wouldn't say the villain or story on it's own or as part of the overall Marvel universe is as compelling as the Captain America series but the mythology and mysticism gives a cool Buddhist touch to the super hero universe and his intellectual/spiritual powers make all us Karma believers hopeful his story will evolve as one of the most obviously powerful characters of them all.

But while Iron Man got acclaim for kickstarting the whole tidal wave of blockbuster hero origin movies, Doctor Strange just sort of rides it and fails to stand out plot/character wise.

The world shifting scenes are out of this world, they are absolutely amazing and I can bet the cost a lot of money, also the cast is pretty good, with some characters being developed way more than others, but I expected a bit more. The story is pretty basic, nothing special about it, the action sequences are like a part from a TV Show, you expect them to have a different conclusion that will happen further in the future.

So much so that really all I could do was enjoy the CGI and pretty colours in all those scenes because I had no bloody idea what was going on.2. The cape was a more interesting character then Dr Strange. Enough said.3. The ending is pedestrian and convenient. Using time travel to fix a problem?

I liked the beginning meditative part in the mountains where he is beginning to recognize his powers. But then, like all superhero movies these days it became a big battle scene. It gets so complex I have no idea what is happening (I felt the same about the 2013 film Star Trek Into Darkness), who is firing what weapon and what I am watching. For that reason this movie fails big-time.There's more to justify a rating of 3 out of 10 is needed. For one, it is interesting that Strange studies to learn more knowledge, including from ancient books within a library and the bending of nature's rules. But again, it is like a battle of elite superwarriors, like is the case for every superhero movie. What is the case for the masses? Are they supposed to be saved by these superwarriors? Perhaps they should pay for the damage they caused, like was suggested in one of the superhero movies (I can't remember which one). As one site, tvropes, notes, heroes never get in trouble for destruction or crimes ""as long as they're being heroic.""With that, I don't have anything else to say about this film, and this movie review has come to a close."

So the biggest highlight of our lead character in this movie is that he is Successful! How And Why?In the early stages of the film we learn that Doctor Strange will only take on patients he knows he can operate on without any failures and rejects the challenging ones, sending them to other doctors so they fail instead of him. The doctor is also normally only thinking of himself and putting others second or last. These are also just some of the reasons why his relationship with Christine (Rachel Adam) is no more...One night, Doctor Strange is scheduled to speak at a medical presentation. While driving and while talking on a phone Dr Strange is involved in a major motor vehicle accident which forever changes his life...Doctor Strange then begins a path that requires him to put aside his ego to discover the world of mysticism and alternate dimensions.Marvel continues to kick goals. With the huge success of Captain America: Civil War, Marvel is very clever at introducing a new character into Marvel/Avengers such as the introduction of Ant Man in his own film then his inclusion in Civil War.The whole world of Doctor Strange is incredible and I would saw this by far is the biggest highlight of the film. Watching many fight screens while buildings turn around, fold, collapse or even flip is jaw dropping. Benedict Cumberbatch is also brilliant and it felt like he enjoyed the role and gave it all while delivering the highs and the lows of this hero.The only things that has held this film back in the rating scores at Finesse Movie Reviews are two things.1. As far as the plot goes, its not far off from 2005's Batman Begins- a man who is looking for something, seeking answers, goes on a Journey, finds a temple and begins the training process.
2. Other characters. The overall connection between Dr Strange and our past love interest with Christine (Rachel McAdams) doesn't carry a strong nor real connection. Any time they talked about their past or possible future I really struggled to accept it. Also, the villain can come across as dull/weak.While I do feel Doctor Strange is not the best Marvel movie ever, it's still a pretty damn good. Also, If you love Marvel films then you will also know what to expect. Marvel continues to offer great entertainment and exciting new characters that we will see again.7.7/10

",0.4215,0.989,2019-01-01 00:00:00,5,"As far as the extended Marvel universe goes, there are a handful of entries that seem like they were hastily whipped together for the sake of introducing a character so that he or she can be included in an 'Avengers.' This is the case with 'Doctor Strange,' as not even an American-sounding Benedict Cumberbatch can save the film from mediocrity.To be fair, at least 'Strange' is unique, and not a fourth 'Iron Man' or a third 'Spider-man' reboot. Director Scott Derrickson deserves credit for steering this behemoth, as it boasts some pretty amazing visuals and pretty cool settings (Nepal, anyone?). Sure, there's some 'Inception'-like building shapeshifting going on, but it still has a nice look. But when it comes to the content of the story, it's pretty basic (a cocky doctor suffers a setback in his life that he must overcome).As for Cumberbatch, while a great actor, he doesn't feel authentic as a Marvel superhero. The humor injected into the dialogue feels unnatural, as if he is being forced to become Tony Stark. Similarly, Rachel McAdams is usually a great actress but her role as Dr. Christine Palmer is just not a good fit. As for the rest of the cast, a bald Tilda Swinton is hands down the best part of 'Strange' as the mysterious ""Ancient One,"" while Chiwetel Ejiofor and Benedict Wong make for good sidekicks.While not the worst of the bunch, 'Doctor Strange' could have been much better had a few adjustments been made to the story and cast."

The basic story sees talented but arrogant neurosurgeon Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) seeking help from a mystical source when traditional methods fail to help him recover from a devastating car crash. Trained by a sorcerer known as The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Strange learns powerful magical spells that come in handy when he and his new friends are attacked by Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who is trying to help a dark being from another reality take over Earth.While the script might be lacking somewhat in originality and clarity, every last cent of the budget is up there on the screen, director Scott Derrickson delivering mind-bending special effects sequences that really grab one's attention, from the opening fight in London in which buildings fold and distort, to the spectacular car crash that claims Strange's dexterity, to the astounding finale in which our heroes battle the bad guys while time runs backwards (words can't do this incredible technical feat justice: it needs to be seen to be believed).While not the greatest film in the MCU, Doctor Strange is a worthy enough entry that provides enough eye-candy for the duration.

The clue's in the title but a lot of the movie is not really very memorable story-wise. The only thing that is memorable are the acting performances, the amazing visual effects and the musical score.Stephen Strange is a character that is essential to the Marvel universe and Marvel Studios did the best they could to make a movie about him as most of his powers and his stories are quite difficult to understand.I get that ""not everything making sense"" is the point of Doctor Strange but... it's just really bizarre!It's an okay Marvel movie and Benedict Cumberbatch really milks the role but it could have been a bit better. That's just me. It's just setting up Infinity War, right?"

The story is fairly simple, and again a trope (rogue great pupil goes to the dark side) but is enough of a macguffin for the real point of this film - to set up the Dr and lay the foundations for future films. The SFX are excellent and mind bending/confusing in parts, and the Inception style street bending during fights very originally done."

However, some communication was poor, for example some characters had a more robotic voice without use of intonation, which made them less interesting to watch which could be improved by changing tones and expression."

The CGI and other effects in the movie are outstanding. The story was lacking in the start and felt very rushed as it was only trying to move the story to the magic. Other than the pacing the story was cliche but still enjoyable, enhanced by the previously mentioned effects. In conclusion, i believe this is a good movie for a first time watch but other than the stunning visuals i don't know how the story will hold up on re watching."

Some things just don't fit into the MCU, and this character and world should be left out. Hopefully, they'll leave this out of any future MCU storylines.

" Marvel super hero films are now endurance tests and this was a true test
",0.9201,0.7334,2018-10-01 00:00:00,4,"I'm so tired to super hero films. They're all sound and fury and generally seem to waste the talents of excellent actors and filmmakers. Case in point, ""Doctor Strange."" If there was a Marvel movie that was going to revitalize my interest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it would have been this film. Doctor Strange is a different sort of superhero and usually tells different sorts of stories that are much more comics and science fiction in nature, compared to more common Hulk-Smash Marvel storylines. This film boasts an especially fine cast with Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's ""Sherlock"") as Stephen Strange and Mads Mikkelsen (who plays the lead in the brilliant and under seen ""Hannibal"" TV series. Watch it NOW if you haven't!) as the villainous Kaecilius, along with Tilda Swinton and Rachel McAdams. But despite a strong cast, a more interesting of superhero than most, and top notch production values, it's hard to put my finger on what went wrong with the film. What I really think it is, is superhero fatigue. I'm just tired of superhero films and no longer have patience for this formula, even when it's well done. Yawn..."

" The MCU goes psychedelic.
",0.0,0.9998,2018-09-26 00:00:00,10,"Much like my exposure to Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Strange was always a character in Marvel's lineup that I never was familiar with as I never read any of his comic stories so when Marvel Studios announced a movie about the Sorcerer Supreme, I was mildly interested just because of how big of a fan I am of the MCU and the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch was going to be playing the lead so I went into the film with medium expectations and I came out stunned and amazed by what I watched. From it's mind-blowing visual effects and dazzling action set-pieces to its brilliant humor and acting, Dr. Strange is easily the trippiest and most interesting MCU movie I've ever watched.The movie opens in a secret complex where an evil sorcerer named Kaecilius and his followers sneak into the complex's library and steal a couple pages from a mystic book only to be chased out by the head sorcerer known as the Ancient One. We then cut to Dr. Steven Strange, a rich, admired and vain neurosurgeon who is injured in a car wreck which therefore costs him the usage of his hands, leaving him incapable of performing any kind of surgery. After nearly bleeding himself dry financially while trying to find a cure for his damaged hands, Steven hears about a mystic place in Nepal know as Kamar-Taj from a man who was able to regain the use of his legs. Desperate, Strange travels to Kamar-Taj only to be rejected at first but is taken in by Baron Mordo. The Ancient One displays her powers to Steven, showing him various other dimensions as well as the astral plane. Upon seeing this power, Strange begs to taught in the ways of mysticism but The Ancient One is hesitant to train him due to his ego and aspiration but eventually agrees to mentor him. Meanwhile, Kaecilius uses the stolen text pages to contract Dormammu from the Dark Dimension in order to aid him in his mission. Now, Strange along with Baron Mordo and The Ancient One must do battle with Kaecilius and Dormammu and pervert Earth from falling into chaos.Over the course of ten years, the MCU has gone from strength to strength in the matter of storytelling prowess, providing the directors and writers an opportunity to push against the typical and formulaic approach to movie-making in Hollywood by nurturing a resounding and exceptional creative and storytelling insights coupled with the guiding hand of a studio president whose vision for a shared universe is carefully planned out over the course of several decades which has lead to some of the greatest comic book movies of our time like The Avengers, Black Panther and Guardians of the Galaxy, movies that have been indisputably influenced not only by the filmmaking sentiments of their directors but also from what Kevin Feigie has done for the MCU and while some of these movie may not stack up to the comic book movies made by Richard Donner or Christopher Nolan, almost all of the MCU movies stand out from some of the other comic book movies of recent memory for their readiness to tell a familiar story from a different angle while some movies made in the Marvel camp like The Amazing Spiderman 2, X-Men 3, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Spiderman 3 and Fant4sic fail due to their faithfulness to the studio's band of style and micromanagement no matter how hard the directors and writers try to make their vision stand out. Pretty much everything great about Thor: The Dark World was snuffed out and felt like it was being written and revised by a set of rules that were created to increase what made the first movie so great and implant them into a recognizable format. However, most of the MCU films have accomplished this through their grasp on Marvel Studio's distinct designs and awareness by working strongly within the confines and limits of what Fergie has sent up with the MCU but also accept the expectations dictated to them and thus play close to them. By doing so, the films adopt a certain balance and flexibility so much so that such a proven strategy when it comes to filmmaking has paid off time and again for these movies and allows the filmmakers to work their magic in creating a film that not only provides us with an escape from reality but also can give us a great story with characters we can be invested in along with giving us a movie that is fun to watch without feeling the need to be too artsy or snobbish and Dr. Strange is one such movie.Much like what the first Thor movie did with its emphasis on science and magic, Dr. Strange smartly decides to go a similar way with its story. There are never too many unexpected twists and turns that find their way into the story or the arrangement of the movie. The film unfurls precisely as the viewer would expect it to but this isn't always a bad thing. All the parts are there ready to be assembled and are ready to be added with the authenticity of a watch that Strange carries around with him as a relic and all the character archetypes are presented to the viewer even before we have a chance to get to know them and yet the movie never feels the need to bring down or curve these characters but rather it concentrates on improving them to a fine point and feeling the need to realize those points with the aid of a talented cast, glorious visual effects and a slight smirk on the movie's face. More so than that, the relevant directness of the movie's plot allows director Scott Derrickson to attach some rather mind-blowing action set-pieces and as well as some nifty visual composition and while some have whined that all the MCU look the same when it comes to their visual look and color palettes, I personally have never seen anything wrong as it always seems that every movie Marvel Studios makes always has a distinctive look that differentiates from the previous movies and Dr. Strange certainly has a unique look that makes it stand out from previous comic book films and feels like a breath of fresh air.Unlike some more recent comic book films that feel the need to take themselves much more seriously then they should, Dr. Strange actually seems like it's eager to embrace it's outlandish source material rather than run away from it and nowhere does that become more apparent then a scene where Strange does battle with some of Kaecilius's minions with some help from The Cloak of Levitation. A cape is an iconic piece of superhero iconography as both Superman and Thor have shown us and Dr. Strange turns the Cloak of Levitation into a character itself. Every time the cloak in onscreen, director Scott Derrickson can't get enough of it and rightfully so as the cloak is honestly fantastic even if it's just a prop much like the Magic Carpet in Aladdin. Some of the film's most enduring shots are centered around the cloak practically the final shot in the trailer where Strange is climbing the steps to the Sanctum Santorum is truly breath-taking. Despite how the cloak may feel like an inanimate object, it still has a personality all it's own. The instant that Stephan dons the cloak, he starts to become a more useful superhero. The movie makes the point obvious to the viewer that a lot of this is happening directly tied to the cloak itself. To add to that, the humor in Dr. Strange is some of the best in the MCU as every single joke in the movie is timed just right and never feels forced or unwanted but makes the viewer bust out laughing when the humor does come. The scene of Strange confining Kaecilius is particularly gut-busting as Strange grads a bizarre medieval-looking device that results in Kaecilius being caught in a compliant position as the gadget locks itself into place. The scene is a true testament to great humor as well as the power of great writing and comic timing.Like Thor before it, Dr. Strange can be revised as an insightfully quintessential superhero movie built from ideas floating through the artistic subconsciousness. The film feels very recognizable and not just because of its story arraignment but also because it feels very much like a Marvel movie from top to bottom. Steven Strange is pretty much characterized in the same way as Tony Stark was as he starts off as a vain and full-of-himself billionaire but though a life-threating accident and its aftermath, he vows to change and as a result becomes a better person and uses his newfound powers to protect the world and while this trend may seem clich√©d and worn out to some, I felt that it fit the tone of the film perfectly and didn't dwell on the origin for too long as opposed to Frant4sic. Apart from drawing a lot of influence from Thor and Iron Man, the film adds in elements of the TV show House to its portrayal, a British actor speaking with an American accent playing a self-centered doctor who is aloof when it comes to people as well as a few touches of Dr. Who thrown in due to the movie's frequent captivation with time as well as a few tiny callbacks to Inception due to the exploitation of space and time. While the movie may not do any better than the movies it's referencing, it still is able to throw all these elements into a blender and mix them in a way that feels appealing and breathtaking in and of itself.As for the visual effects in Dr. Strange, they are just as spectacular as one might expect. With CGI improving all the time, certain shots and action set-pieces that would have been nigh to impractical a decade ago are now the standards for big-budget Hollywood movies and there's something that can be said about being able to see all these memorable comic book ideas being brought to life onscreen in an aspect that clearly delights in and holds fast to the more bizarre images and ideas of the world of Dr. Strange. When Stephan takes a journey through the multiverse, every area he passes through is realized to such a high degree of perfection that it's almost sensory overload just watch the entire scene but nonetheless, it's all so glorious that you simply can't take your eyes off of it and soak it all in for what it has to offer.

Marvel's humor is also on top. Jokes are actually made to smile, as opposed to jokes from a parody of a film called the ""Suicide Squad"". They are always in place and perform a certain role, and are inserted not just to spoil. The action in this movie shakes the imagination more than light drugs, and the scene with the final fight for 10 days doesn't come out of my head. I didn't see a more beautiful visual part, I was in an inexpressible delight. And of course, everyone's favorite Benedict in his repertoire. Narcissistic genius, how we liked him. Even some of the soundtracks in the film are taken from Sherlock and StarTrack, which his fans can not help liking. Everyone who wants to relax and have a good time, I advise you to watch, will not regret. All that I wrote is just my subjective opinion, which may differ from yours.

This is an exotic, mind bending and thoroughly entertaining film from start to finish. Among the terra firma Marvel characters, we've had playboy technologists, soldiers and a scientist, so this film provides a good contrast in the genius. Cumberbatch is well cast, smoothly encapsulating a determined man. He has good support from Tilda Swinton, the mysterious Ancient One, played with charismatic blankness.
On the downside, the plot is quite straightforward once the rules of the perspectives are understood.We see little of the thought process of a character forced to rethink everything he knows and the nature of reality itself and so when he becomes emotional it feels a bit false."
" A decent intro in the shape of an origin film - more to come next time?
",0.0,0.9896,2018-07-23 00:00:00,6,"This film is Marvel's cinematic introduction (or reintroduction if you believe that the 1978 film should be counted as the first outing - although that was before Marvel Studies was a thing) to a long-time favourite character of comic nerds everywhere, Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange is the master of mystical arts and one of the Marvel Universes most powerful people. More than just a magician or a wizard, he controls powers that affect time and space as in this existence and others. Like other movies, this is an origin story to introduce him. It accounts his story from being one of the world's finest surgical physicians who loses his skills in a freak car accident, to becoming a master of mystical arts and protector of Earth. Being a superhero film you'd already expect a lot of CGI, throw in the magical element and you know that nearly every scene will be CGI'd. Threat not though, for the most part it's actually tastefully done. There are some beautiful scenes in the city reminiscent of ""Inception"", there are some wonderfully choreographed fight scenes too, and wit and humour is never far away from the screen. Some film's feel like they need the central character to grow up and become an adult with responsibilities in order for the film to advance. This feels the opposite, while Strange is a responsible adult at the start of the film he needs to relax and let go in order to be victorious. Perfect for what doubters and Marvel haters need to go through to watch something like this unreservedly without pre-judgements. If a man of science and medicine had to believe in magic in order to accept what his eyes and ears were telling him, then I'm sure cinema goers will be okay to sit and watch this for the joy of cinema rather than ulterior motives. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the Doctor and his portrayal, while a little wooden and void of emotional attachment at times, it was exactly how I'd image Strange being on screen when being plucked from the pages of a comic. I'm a fan of Mads Mikkelsen in general, I think his demeanour is very powerful, he is believable as the villain Kaecilius and I only wish there was potential to be in future films. Oops, nearly a spoiler. OK, so the story is a little formulaic, but it has to be, it's an origin story. The central character was X, then Y happens, now he has to cope with Y if he wants to be Z. It's simple sure, but at least this film had the manners not to pretend it was something it was not. It's a simple and fun film with visual treats that won't offend. I couldn't rate this as highly as other Marvel film's I've watched, but I'm not worried about that either. I know that this is an origin, we'll see Doctor Strange in other things soon, the next film, I'm sure will be better than this - but for now, I say decent introduction, 6 out of 10."
" Its outstanding special effects can't elevate the picture past its poor storytelling and inconsistent tone.
",0.5574,-0.7943,2018-07-15 00:00:00,7,"The visuals are undoubtably fantastic, leading to some very unique action set-pieces that have enough style to set them apart from other superhero films, and its outstanding soundtrack is one of the best of the MCU. It's a shame, then, that the story and tone of 'Doctor Strange' drag it down to be one of the worst films of the Marvel cinematic universe. Stephen Strange is an unlikeable protagonist, one who we can never root for, and this means that the audience doesn't really have any reason to care about the story. Also, the narrative is very predictable and the film doesn't have a proper grasp on time; the 'training montage' is over very quickly and because there is no indication of how much time has passed, it seems as if Strange has gone from a nobody to the sorcerer supreme in mere days. Therefore, it feels entirely unbelievable that Strange can masterfully use his powers and save the world by the end of this film. Throughout the picture, Strange should have been struggling to use his powers, indicating to the audience that he is still learning and developing over time. Another big issue with the movie is its ham-fisted attempts at comedy. It is never funny, yet its 'humour' is always prevalent, even undermining serious moments on several occasions, and this becomes extremely annoying. Sure, a few comedic moments wouldn't have gone amiss, but since the character of 'Doctor Strange' isn't a funny one, this film should have had more of a focus on its serious elements and getting them to be successful. Without its superb visual elements and soundtrack, this could have been a disaster. 6/10"

This is just blue-screen Deluxe and totally unbelievable. Even Benedict Cumberbatch can't save this one for me."" The film was interesting for the first, say, twenty minutes, but I completely lost interest the moment of Dr Stephen Strange's car crash. From there it just became...strange, and anything but believable due to a very poor plot."

Most of them are quite minor, but there is one scene in particular, where Strange talks to that one girl who follows him around the movie while she treats his injuries, that will annoy most viewers.But this movie still wins you over solely through it's usage of CGI and special effects. This movie is drop dead gorgeous. Everything, EVERYTHING, in this movie, is absolutely beautiful. EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!And, while the climax may seem underwhelming at times, some scenes seem to exist to tick you off, and the origin story is... odd, it's worth it just for those visual effects. And the fight scene in the hospital. That's a great scene as well. My one thought, though, is how stupid this movie must have looked when it was first shot, before all the effects and greenscreens and such were added. It probably looked really dumb."

" I am a traveler of both time and space, to be, where I have been ¬©
",0.0,0.9978,2018-06-13 00:00:00,8,"The story of Stephen Strange, a neurosurgeon-the otherworld defender of the universe-is like a surname. A difficult destiny is the character, which he was able to push into the comic world, gently, with varying success. Charisma uncle is not deprived, but very much chakras-mantras-boddhisattva, accompanying his forces and abilities, went against the brute force of the reader's usual superheroes. At the end of the era, they forgot about him altogether, with a nostalgic smile hidden in that box of the sixties, where beads-rosaries, Pucci's prints, preparations for the expansion of consciousness and faith in the possibility of changing the world with a broad smile lay already.In the tenth years of the twenty-first century, in which everything new is a tolerantly fused old, the name of Strange again surfaced. It was sparkling, you can say, in the name of the Marvel genius, to make money from the air density of scripts, good visualization and simple humor. While DC breaks both to itself and the spectator with its three-hour, high-flown epics, Marvel, though slightly podraasteravshy old lightness, is still the same trampled caring and mummy road - eat, viewer, our gruel. Do not push (it will not be difficult - we promise). Do not burn yourself (here's the PG-13 rating). Do not be fooled (we sent you sentries so that you will not forget, as it was in the previous thirty-two films). And how about writing a powerful wizard with esoteric powers and psychedelic patterns in this template template? Yes, a trifle, it is not even worth the trouble, it sits like poured.It helped that Dr. Strange, who appeared to the world not in the best times for comics, is in itself simple as a one-color Rubik's cube. It was not initially difficult - for perception it was complicated by the surrounding situation of a tent under LSD. Reject unnecessary - and get ""I do not want to be a hero - it's dangerous! - I must be a hero. "" This is what the Marvel script writers used, revealing the hero exactly to the extent that it will help him to be adequately sequenced, trikvelizirovatsya and otsylnichat in the future. But there is one detail in ""Strange"", which makes it a curious movie for watching not only the fans and ordinary lovers of beautiful bubuhs, but also the comedian who is tired of comics, can bring something in a bowl with strong tea. It's about philosophy.
The Strange's world is, first and foremost, a psychedel, which was desperately lacking during the fighting. The fact that the hobo-neurosurgeon was flown once inside the consciousness warms the soul of some pathetic five minutes, and the rest of the time the Mr. Doctor runs on foot and fights with sparks. Not enough skills were not enough for the creators of special effects (the transformations of the buildings were very impressive, Nolan's team puts the class), how much imagination to show something out of the ordinary. Let's say that there was no need to get out of the way because of the desire to not stretch the target audience - which is sad, because walking around the universe of Doctor Strange is at times more fun than drawing another Zakovi, a standard eastern market or a three thousandth Hydra bunker. Believe me, comrades from Hollywood - we are courageous, we are not afraid, we will be happy to see your fantasies. Do not be shy and do not limit yourself, and then, smelling senses, Asgard was our last gift in terms of visualization raisins.And a skeptical raised eyebrow is given to Marvel for another fused villain. Honestly, you simply did not know to which project to attach the extensive fan base of Mads Mikkelsen. However, this is empty: complaining about the clich√©s in comic films is like yelling at the wind, so as not to blow.Enjoy watching"

the concept of how the movie starts id very different than the other superhero movies.
we are used to a quiet sluggish start where we get to know the character and how it gains its superpowers, but in this one its nice and paints a good picture about his story.
the story plot can be a bit confusing at times but the reasons behind the main hero is different than we have seen in other superhero moviesthe movie had great visuals, the color contrast works great.

I was really annoyed that The Ancient One was a bald white woman though.. She really didn't look the part. It would have been fine if it was an old asian woman or asian man, but I had a hard time taking it seriously with such a bad casting for that character."

It's also got a nice well rounded story. Excited to see Doctor Strange in the MCU, and I can't wait to see where they take his character next."
" Visual Treats Ahead
",0.0,0.9963,2018-05-27 00:00:00,7,"This film hates itself, and loves itself, much too much.Why hate? Stephen Strange of comics fame was arrogant but firm, not the childish whelp which is written for Benedict Cumberbatch, who amplifies the wiseass teen persona quite naturally, which is irritating, and I think the writers and director wanted that. There is an alienation in this version of DOCTOR STRANGE which says ""Love it or be cast out!"" I feel as if Iam being coerced into a cult of Cumberbatch, but Doctor Strange should need no such coercion. There is so much here to attract and potentially inspire, and yet we are subjected to acerbic banter rather than philosophy, and emotional band-aids rather than life lessons. I've said elsewhere the animated 2007 offering did it better. Sorcerer Supreme here is arbitrarily female, bald, with English accent, and a cheater in ways of magic; the animated version respected not only the original Sorcerer Supreme but also every ethos of Shamballa, Shangri-La, and other Tibetan adventure stories. Stephen Strange here is quite sarcastic for a man on a mission, unlike Tyrone Power in the wonderful LOST HORIZON, and more so for being out of his scientific element and such a klutz as a sorcerer until his miraculous transformation, which, honestly, must all be credited to the Cloak of Levitation. I don't buy this Mordo either, but happily I liked this Wong. As for villains, only Dormammu was worthy, the dark-side ""Nazi-ish"" Kaecilius really very feeble for all his expertise and stolen knowledge, as well as power from Dormammu. One more thing, did not like the generally-terrific Rachel McAdams in a wasted role full of snark and disbelief, an exaggerated version of Dana Scully. So in these fashions, I feel the film has a self-loathing, and perhaps a razor blade for the audience, giving us dregs of characters.Why love? The film dotes on its effects, from the casual walking through a magic doorway or membrane to the ultra-spectacular meeting with Dormammu. There is of course a necessity to overwhelm with these visual delights since the characters are basically paper-thin and the story so disjointed. There are inclinations of INCEPTION here on the FX, but I can honestly say DOCTOR STRANGE does it better in any case. The film is overlong at 1hr55 (counting credits and teasers) but there are enough different cinema tricks to keep you entertained. That's why I say the film loves itself too much - it could easily have done everything without losing any eye candy in about 1hr40. The Dormammu confrontation was pretty clever, with the time loop, although more exposition of how that is accomplished should've been forthcoming. Honestly, the comic books are MUCH better at information than are most Marvel movies, and I don't particularly enjoy having to suspend my disbelief when I know the answers are on page 14 of issue 37 or whatever.I was also happy that Mordo turns out to be evil, which is correct for the character, but the explanation here, that the Ancient One had broken a rule to save the universe, and Strange to save Earth, is just a bite too much for me to swallow. I really liked the animated version reasoning better - Mordo is just not a guy who accepts second fiddle."

The film was confusing, rich with plot holes and not a very intellectual watch.Cumberbatch is a fantastic actor however as Dr Strange the script really gave him no scope to perform well.The CG was incredible and that's the only reason it deserved a 4/10 if this was a low budget movie with exactly the same plot line. It would never have even made it in to the big screen"

Cumberbatch does a great job, and is made for the role. You can see how comfortably he delivers his lines and mannerisms. The rest of the cast is good as well. The special effects are among the best ever created for a film; up there with Star Wars, The Matrix, and The Sound of Music (just kidding; wanted to get a cheap laugh from you). Looking forward to the sequel."

It had a few cool fights, but I don't understand the logic in Doctor Strange needing to be a superhero. He was just a surgeon and traveled around the globe to get better treatment after his accident, but the person he came to see knew realms of other worlds and gave him powers just for the sake of being a superhero. Usually superheroes discover their alter ego on their own."
" Holy Whitewashing, Batman!
",0.0,-0.9903,2018-05-21 00:00:00,1,"As if Marvel couldn't stand to erase, diminish, and utterly belittle enough Asian people, they're ripped any role an Asian actor should be playing and given it to white people. This is a sickening trend in Hollywood, and Doctor Strange makes sure you KNOW that they don't care a single bit about Asian people.Shamefully horrendous acting by BC only adds insult to injury. A story line that has no rhyme or reason doesn't help. No one cared about Doctor Strange to begin with, but he got a movie anyway, and they still managed to blow it even worse than you'd imagine. Think Ant-Man with more racism.I wish I could rate it a negative 10, but IMDB only allows as low as a 1.A pathetic movie with pathetic acting and pathetic whitewashing. Just pathetic!"
" A good first start, but what about the SECOND ACT?!
",0.3054,0.9508,2018-05-13 00:00:00,6,"So Marvel told the basic origin story of Doctor Strange (Earth's supposed Sorcerer Supreme). But, didn't it feel a bit undeserved? Like really, what did Dr. Strange have to suffer through in order to become the master of mysticism? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! However, Marvel does have a chance to rectify this situation and make this character one of their better franchise movies by simply following up the first movie and making the classic magnum opus Triumph and Torment. If they made this as their second movie, not only would it flesh out Dr. Strange more by showing that he actually deserved the title, but it would also introduce Marvel to the something that it has sorely lacked throughout ALL it's movies; a complex villain more worthy than all of its heroes put together: Dr. Doom. After butchering nearly all of the Thor movies and killing off Odin like some B-rate character, the fans deserve this movie! Stop being lazy Marvel and finally do your films some justice!"
" Outstanding Special effects.
",0.7717,-0.7526,2018-05-13 00:00:00,10,"Doctor Strange has one of, if not the best special effects for its era, along with Inception and The Matrix. This movie is also very scientific for a superhero film, unlike Superman or Spiderman."
" Prepare for Strange..
",0.0,0.9919,2018-05-12 00:00:00,8,"You should really be prepared for the kind of movie this is, because this is a movie that you will probably love or hate. Luckily, the first scene presents what kind of movie it is. You will get an action movie, with spectacular graphics and effects, but also with an mind warping edge that might go some steps too far in warping reality. Especially some of the battles contain so much altering realities, changing directions and effects that it is hard to take it all in and follow the action. But it is also beautifully done, and if you enjoy these kind of effects, you will have a blast through out the movie.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor Strange. An egomaniac jerk that following an accident learns that there is more to the universe than most of us knows. Cumberbatch is a quality actor, and he got good help in Ejiofor, Swinton, Madsen and McAdams (which has a too small role for her talents). All do well, but this is not a character driven movie, so they don't get many opportunities too shine. But it is also a feat too pull of an action hero, and they do well all of them. But fans of Cumberbatch from his previous work might be disappointed. He is not the real star in the movie. The effects are, along with the universe that the movie presents.I do enjoy those kind of movies. When I watched it I thought of both Matrix and Inception... there are more than a few similarities. I enjoy the Marvel universe that connects to a bigger whole. This was another piece to that puzzle, and it fits well.And, as in most Marvel movies, don't miss the crazy credits (the extra scenes - yes there are more than one) in the credits after the movie.8/10"

Dr. Strange is talented neurosurgeon. No one can surpass him in skill. But one day he had a car accident. He lost his ability to treat, but he found a talent for magic. After much thought Dr. Strange decides to go to the center of magic - Tibet. Here he develops his magic abilities. Strange finds the meaning of life in the fight with evil.
For me the best thing in this film is story line. It's very interesting and spectacular. Actors are very good too.
I'd recommend this film for those, who likes fiction and Marvel's superheroes. But I think that this film isn't interesting for children."

",0.0,0.9948,2018-04-29 00:00:00,7,"This would be a 5-6/10 max.First of all, I had already sworn off watching Marvel movies because I found them to be ridiculously similar. Same general plot, same structure, same pacing, same jokes, same fights (especially those get boring quite fast).
But Doctor Strange promised to be different and visually inspiring.
As far as the visuals go, 100% yes. They're really creative, interesting and next level, actually, they kinda define the film, which is why I am happy to rate the film higher than it should be, just because it was more than visually appealing to watch.In terms of being different, well, kinda. 
I really liked where things were going in the beginning (spirituality, astral projection, calming the mind, healing body through soul) because these are all real phenomena, even though wildly different from how they're portrayed in the movie, obviously.
But Cumberbatch, who is a very fitting Doctor Strange, hardly changes during the entire film. I would have loved to see a more dramatic character arch. It was said that he should connect with his soul and let go of his huge ego in order to gain these powers. Well, he gained all sorts of powers but didn't seem to connect to his soul or let go of his huge ego. He still appeared pretty awkward after what one could call his awakening.
Big negative is the villain(s). Felt no connection at all towards them. Didn't care at all about them. Marvel really needs to up their villain game.Over all it was entertaining to watch, especially because of amazing visuals and the eastern influences, but I would not watch it again."

" Some poorly timed humour and a generally generic story can't stop this from being an entertaining and engaging experience.
",0.8515,0.9839,2018-04-24 00:00:00,7,"Thanks to some interesting visuals and a couple of fantastic action sequences, 'Doctor Strange (2016)' is a solid, if broadly generic, origin story that sets up an interesting new hero and gives him one of the widest (though somewhat 'Tony Stark') character arcs in recent MCU history. It sometimes tries too hard to be funny, with a couple of moments being unfortunately undercut by some poorly timed humour. This isn't a major issue, however, as most of the comedy comes from character and fits with the flick's consistent tone. The lead character is initially hard to sympathise with, especially since the accident that kicks off the plot is entirely his fault, but his journey and general charisma ultimately make up for that, even if his transition from 'muggle' to 'magician' is kind of hazy in terms of how long it takes. The piece is actually highly enjoyable throughout and takes a number of risks that more than pay off, especially with its wacky visuals that are a real treat to watch unfold. It also keeps a keen focus on its characters, which is what makes its fight sequences work so well, and has a hold on its themes, too. Overall, though we've essentially seen it before (mystic arts notwithstanding), this is an entertaining and engaging picture that sits comfortably among Marvel's better efforts. 7/10"
" Benedict Cumberbatch Is Doctor Strange
",-0.2023,0.356,2018-04-23 00:00:00,7,"It's sometimes hard to disassociate an actor from their most famous role and for Benedict Cumberbatch, that would be Sherlock Holmes. However he is such a brilliant actor that he never gets that sort of treatment, you're able to separate the character from the actor and I can't imagine anyone better for the role of Doctor Strange than Cumberbatch. Marvel never really screws up casting for this MCU, but I'd say this was one of their best ones. Doctor Strange is different from the other films and I was worried it may be hard to keep up with, but they made it quite simple to understand one of Marvel's most complicated characters. Looking forward to seeing more of Doctor Strange."
" Stranger Things
",0.0,0.9791,2018-04-19 00:00:00,6,"I rewatched ""Doctor Strange"" in preparation for his role in ""Avengers: Infinity War"". To be honest, I'd been putting off watching it again, as I felt going in it was my least favourite film of the MCU - this second viewing confirmed that, but did remind me that it has lots of great moments. Renowned Surgeon Stephen Strange loses the fine motor skills in his hands following a serious car accident. With all traditional medical options exhausted, he heads to Tibet following rumours of a break through cure. There he meets The Ancient One who introduced Strange to the mystical arts and the ability to tap into powers from another realm. But this power can be corrupting, and one of the Ancient One's former pupils, Kaecilius, returns with a plan to release Dormamu and ancient and powerful evil. So, what are my problems with this film? They are mostly in the first half of the film, and mostly around Benedict Cumberbatch. Shackled to an accent he never quite masters, the first glimpses of a successful Stephen Strange aren't enjoyable. His arrogance is understandable, and part of the arc that the character goes on, but the wit is missing. Jokes throughout this film feel forced and fall flat, which is really strange when you consider how successful the 2017 trilogy of ""Guardians 2"", ""Spider-man Homecoming"" and ""Thor: Ragnorok"" would be. Despite the reliable supporting cast, this humour failure extends to them too. It does look good though, the Inception (let's go with inspired, rather than rip off) folding cities in a mirror universe are really good. In fact all the visual effects are as impressive as they've been since day one. (18 movies without a bad special effect is pretty impressive). The ending is really good though and, without spoilers, it's nice to see one of these films end with the hero coming up with a plan and outwitting the villain rather than simply overpowering him, or a Deus Ex Machina finish. I like the way they left the character in this film, and the ""Thor Ragnorok"" cameo pushed towards a better written character. I have higher expectations for the good Doctor in Infinity Wars and hopefully beyond."
" Over the top graphics, not in a good way.

It's a fantasy superhero flick.My problem with it was the ridiculous over the top graphics. To me it was like a 16 year old playing around with visuals on a computer. Without getting in to spoilers, I'll just say the graphics, in way too many scenes is far to ""digital"" in appearance...almost cheap computer ""playing around"" and a lot of the graphics made zero sense as to why they were happening, it was there just to be over the top...we used to see visuals like this, many, many decades ago with a kaleidoscope...using no electricity. Maybe thats why I wasn't impressed.I was excited to see this after the good IMDB reviews, but I'm learning, reviews are not exactly tailored to each person. Almost everyone has a different take on things, like belly buttons, opinions are something everyone has, and they tend to be a little different for each person. But, here's my review for whoever it may help.If you dont mind graphics just for the sake of over the top graphics, you might like this movie. For me it all took away from what looked to be a fairly good story, then cheapened by excessive computer graphics."

The conflict was extremely poorly developed and we never get anything more than token ""come to the dark side, it sounds super enticing and we all exude very evil vibes"" from either of the bad guys. The way the magic and world functions was not well explained, and it felt like many magical things were thrown in as deus ex machina and not explained at all, such as relics or the mirror dimension. Even the Time Stone, which is the crucial premise of the climax and the most important element to the MCU, was not clearly explained either. Time and control were attempted to be considered as themes, with some success, but no real resounding or thought-provoking messages. The visual effects were quite good, but it felt almost comical in its wild effects with a lack of explanation or plot behind the things that are happening. The ending and acting were fine, but overall was unimpressed."
" Good but left me edgy
",0.2382,0.9507,2018-03-23 00:00:00,7,"This movie is good but I gave it a lower rating than most Marvel films because I was a bit confused some of the time. There's little explanation for how they do what they do, how fiery circles in the air allow them to do A, B, C, how time travel works, etc. To compare, I always felt that if I hadn't read Harry Potter before watching, there were certain things I'd never fully understand. This movie takes that phenomenon to the next level. Basically everything is unexpected so you never settle into a pattern of knowing what might come next or what can be done. You're left guessing the whole time. That said, it's still a great Marvel film, with good acting and visual effects."

But this was even more hectic. This wasn't imaginary, this was real. However it was if you watch it in 4D you would enjoy it.Another thing. Finally in the MCU we have some sorcery, direct utilization of magical energy for combat. Discussion of other dimensions; even traveling between them at will. Doctor Strange's final outfit is just wicked cool. If you know the character from the Marvel comics, then you'll know that he's pretty damn powerful. Unfortunately this is an origins film, that is, it reveals how Doctor Strange became Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme; the real deal will come in the third Avengers film hopefully.Bennadict Combabatch was an excellent choice for the sources supreme and also as the voice of Dormammu.However the race/gender change for Baron Mordo and The Ancient One was weird but still good.
The best scenes are when Dr Strange goes up against Dormammu and says ""Dormammu I have come to bargain"" But Dormammu replies ""YOU HAVE COME TO DIE!!"" There is more to this I could talk about but I am going to let you watch it for you self."

" Worst from MCU
",-0.6249,0.9398,2018-03-15 00:00:00,3,"On a rewatch still the worst film from MCU. MCU didn't need another Tony Stark and more importantly, Cumberbatch didn't need another Sherlock. Whenever MCU used magic they gave enough scientific reasoning, like in Thor and while using concepts like multiverse basically like in Ant-Man but here they've just used them without any effort which is not necessarily bad but it definitely turned out bad. The overuse of visual effects, taking the great looking visuals from Inception and trying to make it more psychedelic and the stupid last 20 minutes, what's wrong with these guys. Then there is also The Ancient One who's supposed to be Asian but turned into a bald white woman? There were a few things that worked in this derivative origin story. The cloak of levitation and some of the humour did work but not as a whole."
" An Underrated, Groundbreaking Marvel Film
",0.4215,0.9901,2018-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Yes, this film already has high ratings, but what I mean when I say it's underrated is that whenever I mention this film to any dedicated comic book film fans, they always dismiss it as being a ""weak"" and ""typical"" superhero film that doesn't deviate from the formula that Marvel has gotten good at establishing and repeating. Doctor Strange is a spiritual and mystical journey of enlightenment for its viewers. It is certainly much more than just a rehash of Iron Man, and here's why.The story tells of a brilliant neurosurgeon, Dr. Stephen Strange, whose excellence is prefaced by his harrowing arrogance. After getting into a car crash that renders his hands unusable for the precision of surgery, Strange exhausts all of his resources to improve his condition. With no hope, he turns to spirituality and healing and discovers the school of the Ancient One, where he humbles up and is introduced to the world of the mystic arts.The film takes great care in establishing Stephen Strange as an arrogant and selfish person. Benedict Cumberbatch, known for his borderline sociopathic and arrogant roles as Sherlock Holmes in BBC's modern adaptation and his villainous roles in other franchises (Khan in Star Trek), is very good at portraying a character who is both unlikable yet sympathetic. I'd argue that Stephen Strange's portrayal in this film is far from Tony Stark's portrayal in Iron Man; the first half of the film shows how much Strange pushes the people who care for him away with little to no empathy, including former lover, Christine Palmer, played by Rachel McAdams. In fact, a significant amount of time is given to developing not only Strange as a character, but also his relationships with the people around him and how they serve as foils to his arrogance and eventual redemption. Of course, there are some characters who fall short of development, including the villainous Kaecilius, a rogue mystic and former student of the Ancient One whose primary motivations to use dark magic are powered by his pain of loss. The film attempts to add more development and background to Kaecilius as a character, but given that Kaecilius is a character that's moreso a reflection of the evil Dormammu, developing him as a character can only go so far as adding the finishing touches to a puppet. With a weak villain, this is definitely one of the weaker points of the film. Other than that, it's the first time in a while that we've seen an origin story like this in this franchise that actually felt independent from The Avengers (Ant-Man's opening made the film seem like an extension of Avengers; the last independent origins story we got that actually felt independent was probably Guardians of the Galaxy), and it's the first time in a while we've received a leading character and supporting characters with this much character development.Doctor Strange also features visually stunning and innovative action sequences inspired by the effects used in Inception, but wholly expanding upon them. The scene that introduces Strange (and the audience) to the world of mysticism is visually groundbreaking, experimental, yet also accessible for audiences as it puts them through a roller coaster whirlwind of abstraction and surrealism. The first major action sequence featuring Strange in New York City features the action scene we dreamed of in Inception that we thought we'd never get, and the final climactic fight in Hong Kong gives a unique opportunity to watch a fight happen in full reversal while it's characters fight in real time. The resolution to the climactic fight is also original and unique; instead of the ""big fight"" we're waiting for, Doctor Strange manages to use his wits to avoid a destructive fight and win the battle with Dormammu with clever thinking, adding value to his character not only as a mystical master but also as one of the more clever characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I'm normally not a fan of a film relying too much on comic relief, as I feel it cheapens the quality of the film, but I found the comic relief to be used tastefully in this film to help flesh out character development and provide a balance of entertainment for the film's more serious scenes. Similar to, but not exactly like, Winter Soldier's ""On your left"" line, Doctor Strange is riddled with simple single-lines that help develop characters and serve to humble Doctor Strange as he goes through a spiritual awakening.On the surface, Doctor Strange is a visual effects spectacle that tells the story of an arrogant professional turned into an extraordinary and humble superhero, but, as you dig deeper, you'll find that the story is one of the most original Marvel films with a strongly developed (and well acted) lead character and supporting cast. With a clever storyline, uniquely fleshed out characters, and stunning visual effects, Doctor Strange proves to be an excellent addition to the MCU franchise."
" Cliche but fun.
",0.6652,0.9983,2018-03-13 00:00:00,10,"Plot - This is a pretty cliche and formulaic story with mostly unoriginal characters. That being said, there are many elements of the story that are actually pretty interesting. Not everything is as throughly explored as it could be, but some of the plot twists and devices are interesting enough. If this movie focused on different things then what they did, it would've been fantastic. They rushed Doctor Strange's training, and if they'd spent a bit more stuff on that it would've made the movie much more interesting. Action - The action is amazing. Incredible effects are used to aid the incredible fight scenes, which are easily the best part of this movie. Characters - Though not all of these characters are very original, the acting is incredible. The cast brings these cliche characters to life, sucking you into this nonsense. Humor - This movie is pretty funny. Enough said. Cinematography - The effects are all amazing. The cinematography is great. The sets are awesome. This is a movie which is best enjoyed on the big screen - which I was lucky enough to see it on. The whole look of this movie is amazing.Overall this movie was fun. It wasn't super original and there's a lot of bs in it, but the action was good, the acting was good, and its something you can have fun watching. If you haven't watched it yet, be warned, there are several end credit scenes."
" Doctor Marvel...
",0.0,0.992,2018-03-10 00:00:00,7,"""Doctor Strange"" is an action fantasy movie of Marvel in which we watch a neurosurgeon who had a tragic car accident and lost his ability to pursue surgeries. Devastated by it he starts a journey of physical and spiritual healing. In this journey, he discovers a new world of mystic arts and soon his life goals change from just be a neurosurgeon to protect the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I liked this movie because of the plot and of course the good interpretations of the cast. At this point, it has to be mentioned that the interpretations of Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Dr. Stephen Strange, Chiwetel Ejiofor who played as Mordo and Mads Mikkelsen who played as Kaecilius. I have to admit that I expected more from Tilda Swinton who played as The Ancient One. The direction which was made from Scott Derrickson was simply amazing. The visual effects of this Marvel movie were once more outstanding as the cinematography too.Finally, I have to say that ""Doctor Strange"" is a very good movie for its kind and I believe that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to have a great time watching it since it's very interesting and you are going to enjoy it very much."

",-0.2023,0.834,2018-03-02 00:00:00,10,"I've watched all of the Marvel movies and Doctor Strange is my favorite character and movie (I never read a comics), I loved the movie and the story behind it. I hope they make more parts of Doctor Strange. The effects are amazing and the staff is well chosen."
" Marvel makes a character that shouldn't work, WORK
",0.4215,0.7811,2018-02-22 00:00:00,9,"I didn't expect much of this film, mostly because I really never cared for Dr. Strange or this side of the Marvel universe. To me the good Doctor was best left in the failed TV movie from days of yore. But I was wrong. Scott Derrickson brings a great dare I say edgy sensibility to a character who could have been all too much like an Iron Man clone, but with sorcery. The only thing I can really say I have misgivings about are Marvel's all too familiar villain problem (despite the amazing actors cast), and it feels like it's all over too soon."
" A Personal Favorite
",0.4588,0.999,2018-02-19 00:00:00,10,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe can easily be divided into two categories - the Sci-Fi/fantasy movies (like Guardians and Thor), and the more earth-based/thrillers (like Iron Man and Captain America). It seems like everyone has one side of it that they prefer. Personally, I'm into the Sci-Fi/fantasy movies, which is one of the main reasons why Doctor Strange is my favorite MCU movie. I know it's not one of the more popular Marvel movies, and my love of it is very personal. I'm fascinated by magic, mysticism, out of body experiences, alternate dimensions, all that good stuff. So it's hard for me to judge this movie in all fairness. It's still a great movie.The movies' strongest aspect is easily, as I said, the fascinating powers and abilities of Doctor Strange and those who use the Mystic Arts. Watching them harness the mystic energy and use it is such a cool thing. The multiverse scene was probably the best moment in terms of visual effects, possibly ever. Some of the coolest moments are the ones that involve bending reality, and the difference between the real world and the Mirror Dimension. The best scenes are the multiverse scene, the astral projection scenes, and the scene with New York in the Mirror Dimension. The fact that this movie didn't win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects is appalling. The environment of Kamar-Taj is also interesting. It has people learning the Mystic Arts, a library of ancient books, and has doors to the three Sanctums in London, New York, and Hong Kong, which defend the world from evil forces. It feels like an Asian Hogwarts, but it's one of those movie places that you wish were real. Dr. Strange himself is very similar to Iron Man, with the whole cocky rich guy attitude, but Benedict Cumberbatch does such a great job at playing him that you still end up liking the character. The most interesting character, however, is the Ancient One. She brings a degree of moral ambiguity to the movie, and the truth about her is a great twist, and one that's very fun to think about. Mordo was an OK character. He wasn't dislikable or anything like that, but he was far from Marvel's best sidekick. Wong is a boss. That's all there is to it. Kaecilius also isn't Marvel's best villain, but his backstory does make it seem like he knows what he's doing may be right, even if he clearly (as the running joke says) didn't read the warnings. Needless to say, the scene with Dormammu was absolutely fantastic. And despite being one of Marvel's darker movies, it still has some very funny moments in it. I know from a storytelling and character perspective, it really isn't the best, but the fascinating environments, ideas, and visuals make it a personal favorite. I've watched it a dozen times, and I'll probably watch it a dozen more."
" Not bad but amazing to watch
",-0.491,0.9538,2018-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I actually was on set as a support actor, I later watched it and the whole thing unfolded to me, yes it was amazing to see how its been done, yes it could be better especially with the story, one could easily get disinterested with the way the screenplay was mangled to result in a desired outcome."
" Fairly true to the original
",0.6249,0.9886,2018-01-10 00:00:00,10,"I used to read Dr. Strange comics as a teenager and always found it the most imaginative of the Marvel universe. The movie capture much of the magic of the magic. Benedict Cumberbatch is great in the title role and Tilda Swinton shines as the ancient one. More convincing than an ancient old man with a beard - though that might have been good also. Chiwetel Ejiofor was good as Mordo - going through the degeneration from loyal hack of the ancient one to doubting Thomas in a believable way. Mads Mikkelsen was suitably threatening and believable as the arch zealot Kaecilius and was a worthy foil to the growing power of Strange. 
 The special effects are wonderful - the dizzying mirror dimension scenes as well as the encounter with the Dread Dormammu (did they use 'Dread' in the film - maybe not). The pace is good and there is indeed a reasonable character development in Strange from the egotistical materialist to the less arrogant contemplative of the mystic arts. The film captures well the multi-dimensional world of Strange and evokes the threat from extra-dimensional beings in a way that's commensurate with the sense of awe in the original comic rendition. The film never degenerates into an overly fantastic atmosphere, with scenes in the hospital and city streets anchoring the fantastic in the real. The costumes are just right and true to the comic vision. I was glad to see that this film was added to the cinematic Marvel universe. Scott Derrickson directed the whirlpool of action well and gave it the right balance of real and fantastic. Strange's pilgrimage to Katmandu was reminiscent of Bruce Wayne's to Asia to find himself with a guru. Anyway - all in all a fine film and afterwards I felt I could open a portal into another dimension."
" Good entry into unknown territory for Marvel
",0.6908,0.9902,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Doctor Strange' is the 13th (14th? 15th? Even I'm losing count!) Marvel film, and continues the trend of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'Ant-Man' and 'Deadpool' - not the most well-known comic book characters, but they've given chance to breathe and create their own energy separate to the Avengers, and are more fun because of it. Simple premise here - Dr Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) is a famous, conceited, surgeon who has a car accident and can no longer fully use his hands. In search of radical treatments, he visits Nepal and encounters Mordo (Ejiofor) and The Ancient One (Swinton).He - like us - has to surrender everything he thinks he knows and enter the world of mysticism, spells and magic. There's some funny scenes and remarks as he comes to grips with these new possibilities in the world. The film is actually funnier than I thought it was going to be, since Dr Strange is no Spider-Man or Deadpool in terms of quips, but it's handled well. The director, Derrickson, is coming off a patchy output at best - 'Deliver Us From Evil', 'Sinister', 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' - but does a decent job of keeping the pace up and not having too long between scenes with action. Some of the ""city/room-bending"" scenes are great to watch.While the tone is sometimes dark and ""we're all just a speck in this world, which is only part of one universe, let alone the multiverse"", it's generally upbeat and handled more with awe and fun than seriousness and fanaticism. Christine (McAdams) serves as the real-world foil and Kaecilius (Mikkelsen) is an adequate bad-guy. Cumberbatch carries the film and is a douche when needed, and a strong presence at other times. The end-credits scene has a nice quick Thor appearance. I look forward to seeing more of Dr Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

Not sure that I could explain what happened (beyond ""imagine if The Matrix and Inception had a baby"") but I can say that it was wildly entertaining.

Sitting with a friend, we both finished several predictable lines of dialogue prior to the character parroting it out.The only good thing about this movie is that it ends."
" If you suspend beliefs, great effects, interesting story.
",0.6705,0.969,2017-12-21 00:00:00,8,"I have a hard time with these movies. Completely weird with the mystical in the comic scifi genre. I like movies with witchcraft, and weird things, but this was hard for me. PLus, I never knew much about Dr Strange, and he intruded in my all time favorite Marvel title, The Micronauts. He was out of place. So, I am a little biased. Plus, I always have issues mixing the physical superheroes with the mystical ones (back to Micronauts, science vs mystical).I only watched because it will play into the upcoming Infinity War. However, I give major props to the special effects. And over all story line too.The one drawback I found, was his learning and training were so rushed through. I think, and I know they don't like to do that in movies today as to lose the audience, but another good 15-30 mins could have been spent on his training alone. I mean, this is something that would have taken years, and they blew through it in like 10 minutes. he spent more time trying to find the supreme, then actual training it seemed. Not a whole lot of explanation IMO as to the whole sorcery thing.However, a very good flick to watch. Especially if you have HD and big screen. Definitely want to watch it on that."
" The story is run-of-the-mill but the visuals are first-class
",0.0,0.6685,2017-12-16 00:00:00,7,"Scott Derrickson's 'Doctor Strange' plays it safe most of the time by adhering to the familiar comic-book movie format (origin story, followed by training, followed by a battle with the villain). But as the saying goes: if it isn't broken, don't fix it. While the narrative side of 'Doctor Strange' doesn't offer anything new, the visuals are pretty exceptional in at least a few segments. Marvel have been outperforming their rivals for at least the last few years when it comes to cinematography and design, but in this film I'd argue that the visuals surpass even other recent films from the same studio such as 'Deadpool' and 'Captain America: Civil War'. If aesthetics rank highly on your list of qualities to look for in a film, look no further."
" Enjoyable despite having the average Marvel movie plot
",0.6908,0.9976,2017-12-09 00:00:00,8,"Doctor Strange is the introduction of the character of the same name in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like a lot of Marvel characters first films, we get to see how Doctor Strange becomes the wizard/superhero that we all know from the comics.This movie looks good, and part of that is thanks to a cast that looks natural in their characters and do great performances (Cumberbatch and Swinton really stand out here). The other part is visuals, which are filled with effects that are well done overall, but also make me feel sometimes that it was just way too much. There were moments in the movie where a more minimalistic approach would've been better and it wouldn't compromise what the movie wanted to represent. They don't look cheap at least, so they're enjoyable.The plot, while is a little clich√© coming from a Marvel movie, it's enjoyable and actually rich in contend, which surprised me. Being this movie almost two hour long I expected some skippable parts, but pretty much the whole movie is entertaining, interesting and important for the plot. I only felt like Christine is an underused character that deserves more screen time and importance to the plot, put it's just fine the way it is.There's also some funny moments in this movie that Cumberbatch really pull off well and give both the character and the movie it's own personality. I was really surprised to see them and I'm glad they made it to the final cut.So Doctor Strange is good, and I think both comic and sci-fi fans will enjoy it, as it doesn't connect with other marvel movies. Also, don't stop watching when the credits start ;)."

He did an amazing job of bringing a well loved character to life with class and brilliance.I myself have not read any of the comics (yet) but as a newcomer I had an amazing experience. The story, the cast, the special effects and the delivery was 10 out of 10! I wasn't bored for a second and there were funny moments, sad moments, action moments, confusing moments, something for everyone!If you are not a complete marvel geek, you don't have to be to get into doctor strange. I don't think anyone would not enjoy the movie! One of the other things they got right was that the movie wasn't too long. It probably would have been tempting to include as much of his origin story from the comics to please fans as possible but they managed to do it all in 1 hour and 55 minutes, which is about average length for a movie nowadays.Enjoy amazing performances also from Rachel McAdams, Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen!It is a must see you would be mad to miss it!"

" Epic spectacle and outstanding CGI make Doctor Strange another solid-if formulaic-MCU entry.
",0.4939,0.9844,2017-11-12 00:00:00,8,"It is no secret that Marvel has capitalized on the popular formula used in the first Iron Man film in some of their most recent efforts. Doctor Strange is a film which follows this principle, yet it still feels fresh and unique. It possesses the arcane weirdness of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, the general story trends of iron man and the same light tone as almost every MCU film. Scott Derickson's clever direction distracts from the formulaic script via the use of mind blowing special effects; perhaps the best we've seen in a Marvel, if not a Superhero film to date. The cast does well with what they are given; Benedict Cumberbatch portrays a charming Stephen Strange, even if his character's personality and arc feel all too familiar. Tilda Swinton, controversially cast as the formerly Asian Ancient one puts in a good stint, and Benedict Wong is gives an amusing performance as his namesake Wong. Chitweiji Elijifor stars as exposition machine Mordo, and whilst his character lacks depth the actor's characterization is well done. Once again however, Marvel have fallen into the trap of fielding an underdeveloped antagonist; Mads Mikkelsen is undoubtedly a terrific actor, but his villain is ultimately forgettable. At the end of the day however, Doctor Strange ticks all the right boxes when it comes to producing a pleasurable cinematic experience; it is well made, acted and directed, is bundles of fun and has excellent special effects (This film makes Inception look tame in comparison). Overall, I really enjoyed it, and look forward to an inevitable sequel."
" Well worth expanding your mind for
",0.4588,0.9994,2017-11-11 00:00:00,8,"Saw 'Doctor Strange' (although fairly late perhaps) because of liking the cast a great deal, who can argue with Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton, and having liked a lot of what Marvel has done, something that one doesn't see people saying a lot here.'Doctor Strange' is not a perfect film, but to me it was a thoroughly enjoyable one and is one of Marvel's best. Lets begin with the things that from personal opinion didn't quite work. Rachel McAdams does do a good job with what she has, but the character was underused and underwritten. Her screen time, while essential, was not large and her development was sketchy at best. Strange mastering magic does happen too fast, didn't buy how rushed that aspect was, and while there are a lot of fun and witty moments a few jokes felt random and out of place (i.e. Beyonc√©).However, the cast are a major asset. Had reservations about McAdams's character but not with her performance. Benedict Cumberbatch really makes the interesting title character his own and knocks it out the park. The standout of the rest of the cast is Tilda Swinton, wonderfully mysterious as the film's most interesting character and played with relish by her.Chiwetel Ejiofor has a charismatic intensity and Benedict Wong has fun and enjoyed his chemistry with Cumberbatch. Do think that the villain Kaecilius could have been explored in more depth, but Mads Mikkelsen is intriguingly menacing.The story, making the most of a great innovative concept, is never dull and is told with absorbing atmosphere, exuberance and very rarely sacrifices coherence or credulity. There are some really interesting ideas here, explored with thought-provoking intelligence. The action excites and thrills, as well as being visually stunning, instead of being drawn out even though quite long the climax is great fun to watch (or at least it was to me).'Doctor Strange's' script has emotion, wit and tension and although he doesn't have the character growth one would like Strange is a well realised character and Cumberbatch has a lot to thank for that. The music score has great intensity, rousing excitement and nuance and Scott Derrickson clearly engaged hugely with the material.Where 'Doctor Strange' is particularly good is in the production values. It's very stylishly shot and edited and handsomely mounted in production design but it's the incredible special effects (particularly jaw-dropping in the climax) that take centre stage.Overall, while not quite finding it a masterpiece of film-making and having a few problems with it 'Doctor Strange' was a thoroughly enjoyable film and among Marvel's best. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

Prepare to get your mind blown as reality folds in upon itself, conceptually and physically, as Strange crosses paths with unique and powerful characters who attempt to aid him or are his foe. There were so many meaty and mind blowing visuals that they were simply mesmerizing. To top it off, they complemented the story and weren't not just for fluff. While being a serious and weighty subject, there was an appropriate level of dry wit comedy mixed in as Strange is just a normal human. Some may see that as foolish cockiness. I didn't give it a full 10/10 as the story was a bit to expected or done before from the 10,000 feet level as I pretty much knew how it would end up.

" Escapist fun but cynical prequel plot
",-0.3071,0.9212,2017-10-05 00:00:00,5,"I did enjoy this movie. As with all the Marvel movies, the special effects were excellent and the premise was novel and engaging. I was disappointed by the lack of humour that is so prominent in those other films of the Superhero genre (e.g. Iron Man). In that way, it felt more like a DC movie than a Marvel. The attempt at humour with Wong near the end was poor in the extreme. Although, I did laugh at the cloak pulling Doctor Strange about.Chiwetel Ejiofor is an amazing actor and brings his own special magic to any role he plays. I especially liked him at the end when he changes to bad and I look forward to watching him in the next instalment. Tilda Swinton was a bold and interesting choice as the Ancient One. This is a complex character, especially when one is never quite sure what side she's on. She looks pretty scary bald.Benedict Cumberbatch is another matter for me. He is fantastic in Sherlock and it suits his acting skills down to a tee. However, in Doctor Strange I found his accent annoying and his performance somewhat overacted or underacted at most times.My main criticism of the film is the cynical prequel plot. It's a half film in the rolling, money making juggernaut of Marvel. It felt to me like they got part way through, ran out of ideas and thought they'd release it anyway because people will always eat it up if it has the Marvel name. He solves the end problem so easily - ""Oh I'll just loop time"" - woo hoo, the Dormammu followers are gone, the big scary demon (that the Ancient One has apparently fought for hundreds of years) is gone. Yes it was a clever ending but disappointing too. Overall, if I had paid to go to the cinema to see this I would have walked out unsatisfied."

Doctor Strange has powers out of this world and out of this dimension, avoiding sfx is impossible and the sfx crew did an A+ job. it's beautiful!Personally i'm not stoked about Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, he was dull and i didn't felt he truly believed in the character enough to pull it off.

Before long, Strange is forced to choose between his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence. One of the most glaring sins of ""Doctor Strange"" is how quickly Strange masters magic. There isn't much tension in his arc. While he struggles briefly at first to keep up with other students The Ancient One has taken under her care, he's soon stealing sacred books out from under Wong (Benedict Wong), the sharp-eyed master who protects the texts at The Ancient One's behest. Strange plays by his own rules, growing far beyond the skills of those around him. There were deep focuses in the movie. Which showed the relationship between characters and objects in their environment. For example- when Strange trains with Mordo and learns how to use magic. Also, High Angles were shown in the movie. The camera was positioned above the subjects and made the subjects to appear small and insignificant. For example- When Strange gets chased by the villain Baron Mordo and the buildings collapsed. Overall I really enjoyed the movie. The director Scott Derrickson did an excellent job to create this movie. He provided the good plot, angles, sound, shots, lighting etc. The actors did very good job with their roles and contribution. Also, the director was successful to help the actors act their roles better. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy fantasy and action."
" My favorite Marvel movie next to Iron Man
",0.7003,0.9633,2017-09-29 00:00:00,10,"One of Marvels best origin stories yet, with a developed plot in perfect balance with the on)screen action. Strange is confronted wit many problems, both from the outside and within. The small touches of humour and tint of romance make it an amazing Marvel movie. The one turn-off is that sometimes, one could practically see the money glued on the screen."
" How do they do it?!
",0.0,0.8225,2017-09-28 00:00:00,9,"Benedict Cumberbatch who plays the main role of Dr Strange stars as the head strong, pompous neurosurgeon whose personal adversity leads him to join a legion of sorcerers and to learn the inner most details of the universe. He perfectly plays a man who develops from being overly cocky to being smart with his skills and knowledge, the tragedy that shocks the audience actually turns out to be exactly what he needs in his life as he learns to be humble and have humility. The film had me hooked from the beginning, this was done brilliantly by the director Scott Derickson who has included and thought of every variable possible to keep the audience hooked and on the edge of their seat in every scene in the film, even the scene where you are just literally looking through a door to see where he come through the portal. Furthermore, there is a lot of cracking shots in the film, especially the scene in which Cumberbatch and Swinton are having a conversation while lighting strikes illuminate the sky and reveal the drifting snow in the wind. Now in every Marvel film there is always the balance of Superheroness and comedy, and this is still evident in Dr Strange through the satirical humour that Dr Strange uses as well as the subtle humour and obvious humour. Furthermore, the CGI used in this was exceptional, bending buildings and folding streets, I didn't initially notice any problems with the green screen but I've heard from others that in some areas it has been a bit hazy and lacking in quality but I never noticed it. Highly recommendable to anyone. Follow me on Instagram @gabewatling and Twitter @gmwatling"

The final act falls victim to the usual MCU formula2. The entire magic sub plot needed more details3. Wasn't long and detailed enoughOverall this is actually a pretty decent effort on the MCU but I feel like it could have been a little bit better. However, if future MCU movies catch this momentum again, I do have some hope. By this point I have done all the MCU movies. Now I need to do another series. Maybe the Metal Gear Solid series"
" No originality. Style over substance
",-0.296,0.9965,2017-09-26 00:00:00,5,"Doctor Strange is boring and has some of the worst acting I have seen in a Marvel movie. The best thing about the MCU is that it makes consistently fun films, but Doctor strange just falls completely flat. Don't get me wrong this film is no Suicide Squad but it is such a cookie cutter movie that has bad acting and terrible dialogue by the main character that I found it very hard to enjoy.Let's look at the bad things first and then lead with some good things the film does right. The reason I hated Doctor Strange himself was partly due to the fact that Cumberbatch played him terribly. The US accent he uses when he is playing Strange is inconsistent at best. Honestly it sounds like a guy from Hammersmith doing an American accent. At no point in the film was I sitting there thinking he's not English. It took me out of the film so many times that I dreaded the bits with him in.Stephen Strange is very poorly written in this film. He starts off as an arrogant a**hole and doesn't change at all throughout the film. His demeanour would be fine if he was charismatic or a little funny but all of the jokes he has written for him are painfully unfunny and fall flat. The Beyonc√© joke he has with Wong is just BLEH and a classic example of terrible dialogue that is throw into this film. With superhero films you have to make them relatable and at least funny in some scenes. Iron man does this very well as Tony Stark is an a**hole, like Strange, however Stark has charisma and was written with funny lines that made him relatable as a character. Stark is good and tries to put others first which most audience members share and this is how the audience relates. Strange cares for himself and no one else, making him hard to relate too and making him unlikeable. He doesn't change at the end of the film; he just comes to the realisation that it is okay to loose sometimes. He doesn't even stop being a selfish di*k head so there is little character development for our MAIN CHARACTER!Tilda Swinton plays the ancient one. I will not go into whether I think Swinton's character should have been played by an elderly Asian man like in the comics, I will let the SJWs get hard over that one¬Ö.I personally don't care that much; as I have not read the comics so I'm not that attached to the character. Swinton is okay and does know how to portray a wise woman well I guess. Her character can sometimes be a boring wooden character sometimes but not to the point where it ruins the film¬Ö. That's all I have to say on her.The plot is a simple cookie cutter plot that Marvel likes to use again and again. Honestly the plots in some marvel films are so samey that you really have to wonder about the originality here. Doctor Strange follows the same conventions of most superhero movies like a big fight at the end with a powerful bad guy, sidekicks turning evil and a treasured mentor dying. While there is nothing wrong with conventions it would be nice for marvel to break this chain and deviate from the norm. The CGI was good in this film. The scene where Strange is first shown the mystic arts and the ""dream sequences"" where the worlds are turned upside down are great visually. CGI is great and can really help a story along when a character is explaining the magic used. This film is a good example of that and when Tilda Swinton is explaining these principles to Strange it is at least fun to watch.The other technical parts of the film are barely noticeable. I have no opinion on the music because I wasn't really paying attention to it at all. That is a shame as it shows that it was not used to the effect that music can be used in film. The cinematography, as well, fell short and went practically unnoticed by me. In fact the CGI is the only thing worth note in this film from a technical point of view which is sad. This film is a Marvel ""filler movie"" that, on its own, is easily forgettable and does nothing to advance the MCU in any way. Unfortunately the MCU loves to play it safe with these ""filler movies"" like Ant man, Incredible Hulk, Iron man 2 and Doctor Strange these movies are just there to keep us interested so everyone will go and see the new Avengers film or another Thor film.This film could be better if they had just made Strange a likable hero instead of an as*hole and Benedict worked on his accent. It is sad but it is true and it is the main reason why this film is bad. The other characters are fine but hardly anything to write home about and the whole movie is a bit on the mediocre side of things. The CGI is good, well done effects team, but it is that classic case of style over substance."
" Just enough

Along with Thor, Strange is definitely the Marvel character I like less - I refer to MCU since I've never read any Marvel comics.All in all the character portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch isn't that bad, but the screenplay is very very weak. I don't know the comics, as I said before, and I believe that this character is enjoyable mainly for Marvel fans.Anyway I give it a passing grade because the effort is remarkable, visually is astonishing and the actors did a good job (Cumberbatch above all).Scott Derrickson (writer and director) passes from horror b-movies to a surprising Sinister and, eventually, to MCU.

Rachel McAdams' portrayal as Christine Palmer was amazing and a great love interest to Doctor Stephen Strange and amazing Doctor. Benedict Wong's acting of Wong is funny, mind- blowing and amazing! with his looks and stuff Wong will be a big entry into the MCU as he is coming in Infinity War with Doctor Strange. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One was interesting as her teaching to Strange was understanding and her death was what completed her life as she agreed for her death. The Astral Plane fight between Lucian portrayed by Scott Adkins and Doctor Strange was an amazing look from the comics and a great prestige from Scott Derrickson, now the amazing visuals of the film were amazing and was 150 times greater than Inception, and what was surprising was that Doctor Strange actor: Benedict Cumberbatch played the motion capture which is amazing that Benedict is playing a hero and a villain in the same film which is interesting. Marvel Studios' 2016 Doctor Strange Stars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Scott Adkins, Benjamin Bratt and with Mads Mikkelsen and Tilda Swinton and also with an surprising cameo with Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Doctor Strange is Directed by: Scott Derrickson and is now on Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital HD."

" Yet Another Marvel Mess
",0.0772,-0.9582,2017-08-25 00:00:00,1,"Even though Disney bought Marvel you should not attribute this rubbish to them! I can not remember when the last decent Marvel film was out in the cinemas but this should definitely be on the 'do not watch' list along with Avengers Age Of Ultron, and Guardians Of The Galaxy. There are at least one or two more but I can't think of the names of them right now! The characters are all exceedingly bland, I felt nothing for any of them. Not one is really all that memorable. The all-powerful The Ancient One wasn't powerful enough to stop pages from a spell book being stolen at the start of the film so not quite so all-powerful. Strange, after a car accident/crash joins a mystical retreat to learn how to use his hands again because he supposedly can't use them. Before going and finding the retreat he tries shaving but can't do that yet he can use his hands for everything else! The other characters are all secondary and lesser to Doctor strange and because the character, like the plot and the story(line) has so little to it, the film is padded out with stupidly long interdimensional fight scenes that make the film really confusing as there is no reason and no explanation for them. They just happen."
" Kaecilius vs Voldemort? Steel cage. Winner?

I have to laugh how they made a film filled with pseudo-pan-Asian mysticism & taking place partly in Katmandu but had only 1 Asian (born in England actually) in anything like a lead role. And if you start singing Seger's Katmandu to yourself, just wait for the payoff. Confession; for years, I thought the lyrics were ""Howard the duck & Dr. Strange both stayed"" So, this one is for you Chrissie: ""Howard the duck & Dr. Strange both stayed.

" Time is the true enemy
",-0.1779,0.2952,2017-08-21 00:00:00,7,"Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is an expert in movie trivia and part time renown brain surgeon. After an auto accident he loses a lot of use of his hands and travels to Kathmandu where the film turns into an acid trip as Strange enters into a world of word puns, oxymoron, and alternate universes. He is trained by the ancient one (Tilda Swinton) from Narnia...but is now good,...oh wait... yeah okay she is still good. She is training him to combat the dark lord, the Dom in fight a metaphysical battle.The most amazing thing about this film is that they were able to introduce a Marvel character in under three, even two hours. I liked the support cast but felt cheated by Benedict Cumberbatch who didn't seemed right for the part. This, coupled with the constant CG acid trip scenes made the film less than what it could have been...at least for me. The dreary ""Omen"" style soundtrack should of had something modern instead, considering Dr. Strange's love for rock. The dialogue was remarkably dry. Where is Tony Stark when you need him?"

Story, effects, fights literally all amazing literally from the start in London to Hong Kong! I'm very harsh with films, because watching so many means it takes truly an exceptional film to impress me, so that said go see this film, in fact see it twice and I can guarantee that both times your jaw will drop at the scenes in the mirror universe. My rating 9 out of 10"
" How much disbelief can one suspend
",-0.3182,-0.956,2017-08-15 00:00:00,3,"I don't usually write reviews, but this film is just too overrated to not warn people about it.Plot?I mean, I could go into detail, but it would be like trying to count the holes of a Swiss cheese. So let's just recap the more important and obvious ones: The main character is a surgeon, yet he can't seem to do a simple overtake (even after looking at the road exactly 1 second prior). The bad guys are just bad, for the sake of it? I mean infinity is great and all, but surely one would do a little bit more research, before betraying their master and going on a rampage around the world, or is that just me? The rest of the movie, I could've written in sixth grade and it would've made more sense.HumorThere were some giggle-worthy moments - it's the only reason I'm giving this so many stars. Although they clearly didn't know where to stop, as the ""Destroyer of worlds"" was made to look like an ignorant kid tired of playing with a toy he's had for 5 minutes .?!CGII've never experienced motion sickness, but I imagine this film illustrated it pretty well. The action was harder to follow than in one of the Transformers movies and that is saying something. Aside from the inception rip-off spell, the apparently ONLY other spell they used to teleport, looked it was done in MS Paint 10 minutes before the movie was completed.The restSadly there simply isn't much more to this movie. Absolutely zero character development, with the exception of the villain reveal in the credits, even though he was evil from the start, so not a lot there either. Apparently saving the world before it's destroyed isn't that important, since you can always go back in time and fix things. And that's the whole movie.SummaryI would need to slice my IQ in half to even go along with even the most basic developments in this so-called movie. The main character isn't anywhere close to relatable, neither are any of the villains. And once the novelty of the ""fancy"" effects has worn off (about 5 minutes after you first see them) there isn't much more to see here."

" The Doctor Is In
",0.0,0.3182,2017-08-13 00:00:00,6,"One of Marvel Comics great superheroes finally gets his turn at screen immortality. Doctor Strange who has a manner similar to the TV doctor named House is a rather self satisfied and smug individual. He's a genius and he makes sure everyone knows it. But one night he's involved in a serious automobile crash and his physical body fails to heal entirely. He's left with a palsy that makes being a surgeon out of the question unless you mean tree surgery.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor John Strange and like Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge he goes to the mystic east to find healing with the Ancient One, a gender bending guru played by Tilda Swinton. He learns a lot about the metaphysical nature of the earth and how worlds co- exist in the same space and how some chosen few like he's been chosen are guarding the portals between those worlds. When those worlds are open it can get real messy.There are times where the plot gets a bit vague and I guess you have to have been a Marvel Comics fanatic in order to get a lot of the subtleties in the story. Something I do not claim to be.Doctor Strange did get an Oscar nomination for Visual Effects and we'll no doubt see a sequel if the demand is there and the money is right."
" When do people get tired of Marvel stuff and their ""treatments""?
",-0.0258,0.9918,2017-08-13 00:00:00,7,"I can't say that I belong to the target audience of superhero films, but I do not exclude them; well, several of them have given me good moments and memories. Also, I do not declare that special effects would necessarily kill the idea or watching pleasure, particularly when looking back on movies decades ago when the technology level did not permit to include out-of-this-world or sci-fi elements in a way in conformity with the rest of the movie... But still, at present, I tend to come across that flashes and effects constitute the main frame/value of a work.Most of the above applies also to Doktor Strange, where even good character actors have limited opportunities to show their talent, when dialogues - even when witty - are artificially constructed, and the pre- ending scenes are predictable and consisting with action in the main. Yes, all is visually great and without ""bastings"", but the movie itself lacks novel approach and visions, resembling a known fairy-tale in a different sauce. Costumes and masks are great, but versatile actors tend to use their facial expressions and body movements while producing a wonderful role...Acting 9 points, script 5 or so, in total - 7. To me, the weakest movie with Cumberbatch involved - whom I admire a lot. On the other hand, I comprehend that fame and acclaim is often based on the number of viewers, and so more versatile roles are about to come."

In desperation he travels to Kathmandu, Nepal, to seek the an organisation known as Kamar-Taj. What he finds goes beyond healing, or the physical world.Initially, quite interesting. The Dr Strange backstory was an engaging one and made you think that this movie could be different to all those other adaptations of comic book characters.Sadly, it was not to be. From a point the mystical narrative comes into play, which is just an excuse for the director to show off his CGI skills. From then on it's just your usual style-over-substance comic book vapidity."
" Dissatisfied
",-0.3818,0.823,2017-08-11 00:00:00,3,"Doctor Strange began at a slow pace as if it was going to be a medical documentary, which is more or less what the world expected coming into this film. But the further on we got into the movie the less medical it was which became a real plot point as any movie/documentary with doctor in the title should be at least 50% medical. This was very disappointing due to false advertising. Due to the sudden change of pace from a pleasing medical film into a confusing and intense action film. A positive to take from this movie is a strong meaning of life which Stephen obviously has no concept about due to giving up being a neurosurgeon (27722899.47 Jamaican Dollar Annually) to a superhero (0 Jamaican Dollar Annually)Overall a promising start with a poor ending"
" A reasonably interesting story, but it never quite manages to fully get into its stride
",0.2144,0.889,2017-08-10 00:00:00,5,"Brilliant neurosurgeon Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) finds his whole world turned upside down after he is involved in a serious car accident whilst he is on his way to give a speech. Strange survives the crash, but ends up with severe nerve damage in both his hands which forces him to quit his job. Things are looking bleak for Strange, but when he hears about a man who made a full recovery from life-changing conditions at the hands of the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) Strange heads to Nepal hoping that she will be able to do the same for him, but nothing could prepare Strange for what he was about to witness or what he was about to become....The first thing that needs to be acknowledged here are the special effects which are terrific and are some of the best special effects that I've seen. Whilst the effects are great I did start to form the impression that they were more important to the director than the actual story and it starts to get to a point when the special effects engulf the story and, at times, it just becomes a bit too much.The story itself is quite interesting in its early stages where Strange seeks out the Ancient One in the hope that he can be healed and returned to his normal life. I also found the training aspect to be interesting as well - particularly with Strange's struggle to create gateways. However, in the second half it becomes much less interesting as we see Strange battling against former Master Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen). Perhaps part of the problem lies with the fact that I didn't really care much for the characters and was never really interested in their own personal struggles. A lot of the characters here aren't well developed and their motivations also seem rather weak. All of the inter-dimensional warring and protection of Sanctum's aspect of the narrative is glossed over resulting in a rushed and rather anti-climactic final act.On balance, Doctor Strange is a reasonable film with a mildly interesting story, but despite appearing to be an intelligent film it lacks depth and isn't a particularly exciting film to watch. I also couldn't help but sake the notion that it may also be full of its own self-importance."

I actually have some minor issues with the action scenes that I'm positive I wouldn't have if I watched this movie in 3D...¬† I'll try to watch again on IMAX sometime soon because this movie is great!Some people might call this a typical superhero origin movie and they're not wrong, it is ... That doesn't mean the movie is bad! Deadpool is also an origin story and it still is one of the best movies of the year! Obviously, it's not as conventional as the others, but if you read my introduction above, you can basically say the same about Deadpool (a guy with a normal life -> accident -> gets superpowers - > a bad guy comes along -> he has to defeat him). Doctor Strange might not have the uniqueness of Deadpool, but it's still a well-told story.Starting with the pros, this is easily the most beautiful film of the MCU. The visual effects are unbelievable stunning, the action sequences (even if with some minor video-game-like scenes) are gorgeous and the¬†Inception-like building's distortions are mind- blowing. There's a scene where¬†Strange ""travels"" through this new world of magic and this is THE SCENE! The one that everyone will talk about at the end of the film, the one that you will watch thousands of times on Youtube and the one that you'll never forget! The only thing I can say right now is ""congratulations"" to the visual effects team, they just won themselves an Oscar!If there's one thing that DC could take from Marvel, it would be the cast and the production team. Once again, the director did an excellent job with a perfect staff and all the actors and actresses were brilliant. Benedict Cumberbatch didn't go out of his comfort zone at all since Sherlock Holmes and Stephen Strange have a similar personality, so he just nailed his performance! He perfectly captioned the egotistic, smug, cocky, funny and HUMAN doctor. Human because, even after he learns his powers, he doesn't forget who he is, he's still arrogant, but when he kills someone he's truly affected by it! He's still a doctor, he saves lives, so killing really triggers him and Cumberbatch is amazing demonstrating that.Tilda Swinton was the one that I was always so intrigued to see and hear. The Ancient One is a very mysterious character and every time she talked I felt dragged by her voice into this ""full-attention mode"". She was thrilling and I have no words to describe how surprised I was when I met this character. Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is the right-hand of The Ancient One, he follows her lead and trusts her blindly, which gives him the motivation to do what he's going to in the sequel. Ejiofor also did a great job in showing the strict personality that his character has, the full respect for the laws of nature make him question everyone that breaks them. Master Wong, who is played by Benedict Wong (coincidence?), is an extremely fun character. The interactions between him and Strange were super funny and I was always with a smile on my face when he was on the screen.Kaecilius is as good as his actor, Mads Mikkelsen. He is not supposed to be the main villain since there's a higher power, but he has a lot of screen time. The oh so powerful villain appears for like 5min and Kaecilius is the one that has all the attention. Don't get me wrong, he's a good villain with more than understandable motivations (he actually has a very intriguing backstory), but he wasn't the biggest evil to fight against (he was basically a puppet for someone else to achieve a greater objective). This time Marvel's villain wasn't as effective as the other times.Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) is the college and lover of the famous doctor ... And the ""romance"" didn't work.¬†McAdams is perfect in the scenes that she's in, which are very few and that's the problem. Literally, if you take out all the scenes where Palmer shows up, there's only one that saves this character. If¬†Lois Lane was the damsel in distress on¬†Batman V Superman,¬†Christine Palmer was the doctor that was only necessary when our heroes were hurt and that's too little for a character of this importance. This is by far my major issue with this film.The other issue would be very few scenes from the action sequences that seemed very video-game-ish and some other scenes where it was too much of a camera just moving too fast for us to see ... I don't know if it was because of the 2D, but I feel that I should have liked more the overall action of this film that I did (to make it clear, I did like it! I just expected more in some parts).This is a classic superhero origin story, with an amazing score by Michael Giacchino and a lot of Marvel's usual comedy (they're getting better and better on implementing some belly-laughter humor on their films, the audience and I were laughing so hard throughout the whole runtime). Excellent cast, great directing and BRILLIANT, STUNNING, JAW-DROPPING production and visual effects ...

",0.0,0.8533,2017-08-05 00:00:00,6,"I actually really enjoyed this film. It was very entertaining, and a good way to spend two hours. Benedict Cumberbatch was good, the background of his character was very unique and interesting, and the other characters were complex and somewhat relatable. However, this movie had many flaws.Firstly, the storyline. Now, the backstory for Dr. Strange was very interesting, however, it was after he stopped being a surgeon when things began to get odd. It is all too common for movies to not explain their stories, because there are, 'things you don't understand.' However, in movies such as The Matrix, that line is used to evoke mystery and keep the audience engaged. I found that in this particular film, this was a tactic used by the writers to not have to explain their own story that they wrote. It gave me the feeling that they conjured up a great storyline for a great film, but they were unable to think of what the characters were actually doing in the film. It was not really explained what the characters were doing, it was just all of a sudden, Dr. Strange could conjure up a gold weapon and they had to fight people who wanted to ruin the world for no particular reason, and ended up concluding the film using time travel, another tactic used for easy endings.Now I am all for time travel movies. Films like Back to the Future are some of my favourite films of all time, but time in this film does not work for me. Time can be used to solve all of film's plot issues, and does not require any creativity to do so. I just felt that the messing with time in this film was not done cleverly, it was simply done to conclude a complex plot.Overall, I did enjoy this film. It had some good elements such as the backstory and acting. However, I felt the storyline could use work, which would have made the film an 8 out of 10."
" Visually Spectacular but some wrinkling flaws
",0.0,0.34,2017-07-30 00:00:00,8,"Doctor Strange did show a good blast with its stunning Inception-styled effects that is mind-blowing plus Benedict Cumberbatch was the right choice to portray the titular character in which his marvelous performance is perfect just like the way other actors in MCU did. Some of members of the cast such as Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Rachel McAdams did deliver a good performances.Rest of the others in case of Tilda Swinton gave a good performance which make it perfect but the problem is that, in the comics it was portrayed as an Asian character and it's no secret that this is white-washing noting that Hollywood never learns its lesson when choosing white actors to portray non-white roles.Then the flaw was with the inconsistencies of the plot and plot holes that leaves scratching their heads for questions. Mads Mikkelsen did give a good performance as a main villain though it fell flat and bland, then another villainous role such as Dormammu is poorly portrayed which leaves to be desired with."
" I personally loved this film. And that's no small feat!
",0.4574,0.4177,2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"this movie has it all. Character development, slight romance (not too heavy), action, loss and sorrow, good acting, good story, and perhaps most importantly, the potential for sequels.That is by far the thing I am looking for most of all. I knocked two stars off my rating for two reasons: anti Christian bigotry planted subtly in the movie, and because digital effects go a little too far at places.There is a scene where Mads Mikkelson's character and his two zealot henchmen are conducting an occult ritual in what is clearly a Catholic Cathedral in New York.... Whoever directed this needs a kick in the face for that scene alone! I am soooo sick of this crap!Also, the digital stuff goes a little far in places. It gets right onto the high-wire of being in bad taste, but thankfully pulls back."
" Good Special Effects with a Weak Comic Book Premise
",0.4019,0.9854,2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"What makes Earth so gosh-darn popular with megalomaniacs and super villains with big heads? Maybe because strange movies are so profitable in movie houses that serve beer and pizza. A planet-sized menace with hairy eyebrows covets the Planet Earth for no major apparent reason and engages a maniacal ""time-bending"" mystic to conquer Earth in his name. Yes, there was an old ""Star Trek"" movie (#5-Final Frontier"") with such a ""large"" villain who gets mistaken for our ""Supreme Being"". Yawn. Fantastic special effects that kept several CGI studios busy working. The effects are a bit reminiscent of the gravity-defying angles and buildings used in ""Inception"" in 2010. Mystic nonsense. Fortunately for us such effects make for a great ""popcorn movie"" that I liked in spite of itself, for the fancy graphic effects alone. It almost made me dizzy on a small(er) 40"" screen! Rachel McAdams plays the perky long-suffering female surgical ""love interest"". Best effect: The Doctor split into his physical and astral beings and directing his own ER surgery. Moral: Don't play with shards of glass from magic mirrors and stay away from time portals. Like James Bond, the time-bending Doctor will return in other Marvel Adventures. Whether he becomes another great ""Iron Man"" character or the now worn-out ""Hulk"" remains to be seen. I am still waiting for the battle of the Muscular Marvel Girls starring female heroines in skin-tight plastic leather, like She Hulk, Spider Woman, Black Cat, and Black Widow (Sigh.)"
" Admit it, the Green Screen is the real hero here.
",0.6597,-0.8535,2017-07-26 00:00:00,4,"Seriously, is that what it takes to conquer viewers nowadays ? Just a bunch of CGI and cheap plots ? The whole plot smells a lot like the Dark Knight series. Broken guy goes to the mountain to train and comes back a superhero! Had it not been for the EFX, this movie would be bare bones. Seriously nothing holds this movie together from beginning to end. The movie should have finished as soon as Dr Strange acquires the eye of Agamotto and finds out he can control time.From there on, he could just have just used that device to reverse time against the main villain and the movie would have ended!"
" Has all the right ingredients, but fails to cook a tasty recipe
",-0.5719,0.9711,2017-07-23 00:00:00,4,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In this latest Marvel adaptation, brilliant but arrogant surgeon Dr Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is involved in a car crash, and loses the senses in his hands. In order to find out the secret behind his recovery, he travels to Kathmandu, Nepal, where he meets The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor.) Whereas the Avengers fight their enemies with force, this is a group that harnesses their inner power beyond the mortal world, in order to defeat Kaerilius (Mads Mikkelson) and stop his plan to destroy the natural world and its order.The latest origin story in the Marvel juggernaut stands alone, and marks a shift in approach to the traditional superhero persona. While it's as laden with dazzling visual effects and set pieces as the usual fare, DS seems to revolve around a more cerebral bend than the smash and bash antics of Spider-Man, Iron Man and the like. Strange is a character in his own right, on his own mission, and who better than current man of the moment Cumberbatch to play him, which he does very well, embodying the lead character in every inch as, reliably, do co stars Swinton and Ejiofor.As entertaining as they are, too many of these superhero films nowadays get weighed down in endless back story, dragging proceedings on for longer than they really need to, especially the 'origin' stories. So it's to the films credit that it's nice and short, delivering the goods without over-whelming the audience. Like the best of them, it also has a neat sense of humour and keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek. The special effects and action sequences are also amazing, dazzling and colourful. The problem is, the story just isn't interesting or compelling enough, and it's impossible to care about the characters or their motivations enough to get engaged with it. And that, sadly, is a big problem.The end impression you take away from the film is one of pity. It has everything fundamentally going right for it, it's just what's on the surface that lets it down. Maybe they'll get it right with the next film. **"
" Strangeception
",0.0,0.7783,2017-07-18 00:00:00,7,"One could see heavy influences from the movie Inception. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it was also not new.The effects are good and the cumber batches his role quite well as usual. I also had quite a few laughs during the movie. However the extremely weak bad guy in terms of the characters just not being very exciting brought some flaws to the movie.I just couldn't get as invested as I was with Winter Soldier or Civil War. Doctor Strange has potential though to be an excellent addition to the MCU and we'll have to see where they go with him."
" Well That's Strange
",0.0772,0.9283,2017-07-16 00:00:00,10,Perfect Introduction of Steven Strange into the MCU! DS was my favorite character in the MCU growing up. This movie did an amazing job explaining different dimensions and I think Ant Man will be able to crossover into his universe nicely. The scene where The Ancient One pushes him through different dimensions gave me goosebumps and truly made me want to fly out into deep space so I can personally witness the wonders of the cosmos. Dormammu is pretty intimidating and it's quite wonderful how DS addresses that threat. I have to admit I wasn't expecting the post-credit scene(the first) to be so satisfying but it WAS. Strange will prove to be invaluable help to the Avengers in the upcoming installments.
" Expected it to be better
",0.4404,0.9604,2017-07-16 00:00:00,6,"I expected so much more of this movie. I love movies about bending mind, time and matter, but this was just shallow. There was a funny joke here and there, but other than that there script seems to have been written by the same Hollywood movies who write all the other crap. The cast was good though, and special effects excellent."
" Everything I wanted in a Marvel movie.
",0.4215,0.9823,2017-07-11 00:00:00,9,"This movie gave me everything I wanted in a Marvel movie. Was Doctor Strange one of my favorite Marvel movies? Yes, I have to give it that. This was just a fantastic film with fantastic characters and actors, yet had some very minor issues in exposition, and a pretty anticlimactic ending. So in the end, I decided to give Doctor Strange a ""Very Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10. If you haven't yet seen this film, go and do so right now, as this might be one of the best Marvel movies you can see right now.Read more at theVade."
" The Doctor is in!
",0.0,0.9829,2017-07-09 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed this film, but then again I thought I would. I've always been interested in the world of Dr. Strange since I am a huge Marvel fan. His world is one where the threats to Earth are of a more indirect nature and sometimes things that are hidden in the darkness lurk just out of sight, planning on bringing the darkness to our world! So not a typical hero movie as there are elements of other films in here such as The Matrix and Constantine as the film does revolve around a shifting of reality and darker dimensions full of unspeakable things that wish to destroy or enslave the world.The story has a neurosurgeon, Doctor Strange, getting into a car accident where his hands end up shaking badly and all but useless in his particular field. He tries to do experimental surgeries, but they all fail. He finally ends up going to a foreign land where he hopes to find a person who apparently helped a man walk again. What he finds himself in, is the world of mystics and sorcerers. He becomes the student of the ancient one and soon his unrealized talents begin to quickly develop. Unfortunately, another former student of the ancient one is trying to use pages stolen out of a book to gain the powers of the dark universe where a creature named Dormammu lurks and wishes to have the earth and all its people! I enjoyed the film, but I have seen others who have not liked the film. Which is fine, but seriously, if you do not know the source material and do not pay attention, that is kind of on you. I read one review where the person complains that Strange defeats the more experienced sorcerer; apparently, they missed the fact Stephen has a natural knack for using magic and in the comics he becomes the sorcerer supreme. Also, that was an infinity stone he used to win the day and those are actually Beyonders in infantile state and a Beyonder is one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe.So, the film was a fun little distraction while it lasted. It was nice to see it wrap up in under two hours, these days every comic film usually goes like two hours and twenty minutes. This one felt fast and that is a good thing. Sometimes films tend to drag when they go on for too long. I thought the film had some cool special effects and was a nice start to the more mystical side of the Marvel universe. It is also accompanied by two scenes during the credits and both were pretty good. They both actually lead into other films, whereas the scenes from the latest Guardians of the Galaxy film tended to be more of a comedic nature. I look forward into delving into this strange universe more in the future."
" Stunning Visuals, rehashed story
",0.3818,0.96,2017-07-06 00:00:00,5,"Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a witty and somewhat arrogant genius neurosurgeon who has it all, until a car accident destroys his hands. No one and nothing in Western medicine can improve Strange's condition, so he sets off on a journey to the mystical East, where The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), opens the gates to worlds and powers that Strange did not know existed. These powers come handy when Strange has to face off with Mads Mikkelson's disgruntled Kaecillius in a mirror world, where anything and everything can be manipulated.Doctor Strange isn't a bad movie but as far as originality, the origin story is there but the overall concept appears to have been done. Everything occurs at a random pace and mainly wondering as to how he wanted to become this sorcerer simply from wanting to have his hands heal. The character reminded of Iron Man but here he is more unlikable and appears to think he is more superior to everyone else (though he does tone down his arrogance as the film passes). The comedy in the film is filled with little subtle jokes that could have been wiped out, no need for pop culture references for laughs and giggles. The movie felt in every way too simple and predictable and that Dr. Strange was never in any real danger. Not much suspense or thrills which the trailers showed, and the villain wasn't menacing or threatening enough. Although the ending was quite satisfying but obvious. Doctor Strange feels like a mash up of either Batman Begins or Prince of Persia, Inception and Harry Potter. We hope the sequel is more entertaining and overall satisfying."
" A Slightly Different Marvel Film
",0.3657,0.9279,2017-07-03 00:00:00,7,"While on a journey of physical and spiritual healing, a brilliant neurosurgeon (Benedict Cumberbatch) is drawn into the world of the mystic arts.One of the biggest problems with the Marvel film series is how clogged up they get and how hard it is to keep the plots and subplots straight. This is also their strength, as it ensures that people will keep watching the next entry. With ""Doctor Strange"", we avoid that issue altogether... even though we get vague references to the other films in the series, you do not need to know what an ""infinity stone"" is to appreciate the movie.The character of Strange is a good one and not your typical hero. Personally, I found the effects to be over-the-top, as they are in many of the Marvel films. But the ""Inception"" look aside, the plot is certainly unique. Seeing how Strange is used in the future, as he is not often connected to the Avengers in the comics, will be interesting. Perhaps this will open the door for Moon Knight or some other supporting character?"
" A fantastic, excellent and glamorous movie with everything
",0.891,0.9959,2017-07-02 00:00:00,9,"The story about how Stephen Strange became Doctor Strange, the greatest sorcerer in the Marvel Universe and another Avenger, according to Stan Lee's material. His introduction to the MCU is an excellent combination of colors and visual effects, worthy of an Academy Award Nomination as it actually was.Great story! Great acting! Excellently directed. The CGI was believable for what it is. Great comedic relief throughout as usual. Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect for this role. The movie was visually stunning and whilst one particular part others may feel is too long - I felt the movie was well balanced.Filled with surprising corners and revealing secrets. The graphics are above phenomenal and the story is very fascinating as Dr. Strange figures out who he is and how he contains his mysterious and power within himself. One of the best marvel movies by far. Its special effects were great and so was the plot line. ---Yidioo"
" Much better than I expected.
",0.4404,0.9819,2017-07-01 00:00:00,8,"This blockbuster Hollywood movie, actually makes an effort in presenting the character of Dr. Strange in a more accurate light and in accordance with the characters origin story. Benedict Cumberbatch did a fine job of giving the leading character some depth. He projects arrogance, conceit, vulnerability and intelligence with relative ease. The actor who played the Ancient One was also very good. The film has a good pace, some imaginative touches and a solid plot on the whole. The dialogue is pretty good apart from a few lines that strike a false note. I believe that fans of the Dr. Strange superhero will be pleased with this adaptation. I hope a sequel shall follow. I reckon this might happen, if the final scene is anything to go by. Watch this and enjoy."
" Not too good not too bad
",0.1139,-0.9538,2017-06-28 00:00:00,6,"But it keeps you entertained all the time you keep yourself watching it through a lot of suspense and frightful visual effects that make you to forget its several goofs and factual errors usual in this kind of movies. It is the story of a great neurosurgeon that has a car accident which ruins his hands preventing him of perform surgery anymore. He is a kind of stubborn guy with a powerful ego and since he cannot be cured by traditional medicine he goes to Nepal to meet a magic master (a strange lady)hoping that maybe she can cure him through the learning of mystic arts. From then on, however the story complicates itself a lot turning itself into a struggle between forces of Good and black forces of Evil that are trying to destroy our world. Besides its several adventurous scenes this movie has also some metaphysical ambitions and tries to deal with things like Life, Death and Eternity which are too complicated themes to be successfully treated in a movie of this kind. Anyway I have seen better of this kind but much worse also."
" Sucked.
",-0.4588,0.9274,2017-06-27 00:00:00,1,"I grew up with Marvel Comics. This movie is an insult to all I hold dear. ""Let's get a known actor, say, fresh off an Acadamy Award nomination, say, Benjamin Cumberbatch, to insert into a CGI montage, and disgrace a perfectly good Marvel character to make a quick buck."" Done. Contratulations, Disney.Hint to Disney: Get Joss Whedon. Stat. There may still be time to salvage a sequel."

As all, certainly all the major, Marvel superheroes have long since made it to the big screen, his appearance was long overdue. The film loses nothing for those who are not au fait with the man himself; obviously it can cover only a tiny percentage of his adventures, so naturally it concentrates on his origin.Also unsurprising is the fact that it has been updated ‚Äì just in case you didn't realise there was no WiFi in the 1960s ‚Äì but the plot is, well, difficult to follow at a first viewing. There is no sex worthy of the name, and for the most part only comic book violence, so it may not be suitable for adults. Its strong point is special effects, even if you don't understand them either, and just in case you have never heard of him, watch out for a three second cameo appearance by a 93 year old Stan Lee."
" Mixing it up
",0.0,0.9877,2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,"The great thing about the Marvel Universe is that they keep mixing it up. I'm someone who's not as aware of all the story lines or heroes that exists. I never read Doctor Strange for example, so I did not know what to expect. And I guess you can say it's the superhero version of Inception. It is definitely something that we haven't seen before in a Superhero movie being done.And the casting is superb too. You know the effects will be great, they have the money to invest in that. If you don't have an aversion against Marvel and/or are a total fanboy of DC (I myself like Batman a lot and yes also the version Ben Affleck is portraying), you will have a lot of fun watching this. There are scenes even after the movie is over. By now everyone should know that ... and yet still some leave or stop the movie when the credits start to roll"
" I really like the movie but the I think that climax is little unrealistic
",0.2255,-0.8248,2017-06-16 00:00:00,5,"I really like this movie from the fact that I have been a fan of Benedict and science fiction movies. This is the first time I've seen Benedict in a superhero role. The fights scenes in a mirror world, controlled by the Subconscious mind is really mesmerizing. I really enjoyed the scenes where the villain chases the protagonist superhero. However, I found something really annoying about this movies is the climax.If you remember the climax scene of this movie, then you'll come to know that the ending is really unrealistic. The main villain earlier told Dr. Strange that he works for Dormamu, who destroys the Universes and convert them into his dark worlds. He can make someone immortal, against any time constraint. If Dormamu himself controls the time, then how come Dr. Strange trapped him in the time loop; asking for a bargain. Otherwise this film is really a nice one."
" Marvel as self-parody?
",0.4215,-0.5403,2017-06-16 00:00:00,5,"""By far, my least favorite."" It was my wife who said that, which surprised me. She loves the MCU and is genuinely hard to displease as a person.But I agree. ""Doctor Strange"" is several things, but primarily a mechanical origin story; as such, easily the least involving of these movies. It's all ""Inception"" visuals and ""The Matrix"" reality-bending. Strange himself lacks charisma, something Cumberbatch doesn't help, and his all-important lesson about arrogance lacks weight.It's certainly an expensive movie, and the CGI is top-shelf. But those furnishings and that solid cast are carrying a weak story.5/10"
" Cool Visual Effects
",0.3182,-0.6319,2017-06-13 00:00:00,3,"I'd like to preface this by saying thanks to the folks at Netflix for making this available to me at no additional cost or effort. This convenience made the experience less painful as I'd originally planned to rent this title. Also on the topic of Netflix, they also has their productions of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, etc, that lift the genre back up with great stories and characters, while not having to rely on computer effects (and the obligatory 3D IMAX gimmicks that accompany) to grip the viewer. So again, respect.The movies are just getting progressively more disappointing. Dr Strange, with its uncomplicated views on plot, characters, and science, will satisfy most people (10 out of 10!!) but I'm getting bored and annoyed by the formula. The plot here was exceptionally thin: really, it could be spoiled here in a sentence. It's all been done. Chris Nolan and Netflix set the bar for me on the superhero genre. Looking forward to ""The Defenders""!"
" Failed to Measure Up to Its Considerable Potential
",-0.5106,-0.9279,2017-06-11 00:00:00,6,"""Dr. Steven Strange"" (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a highly competent neurosurgeon who has an ego that is only matched by his arrogance and basic lack of charm. But that all changes one day after a car accident causes massive damage to his hands which essentially destroys his ability to function effectively in his chosen career. So having limited success with everything that Western medicine has to offer, he travels to India in a desperate search for a holistic remedy. But when he gets there and meets with an elderly woman known as ""the Ancient One"" (Tilda Swinton) he discovers more than he ever thought imaginable. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I had looked forward to watching this movie for a long time and now that I have finally gotten around to it I must confess that I was somewhat disappointed. To be sure, this film was better in some ways than the 1978 version--if for no other reason than the improved CGI. Unfortunately, rather than concentrating on creating a film with any measure of depth, the director (Scott Derrickson) chose to take the rather lazy and uninspired route by providing--yet another--superhero film consisting of nothing but action and CGI. Make no mistake, a film of this type definitely needs CGI and action. But it shouldn't be at the expense of everything else. That said, although I don't consider this movie to be bad necessarily, I also don't believe that it achieved its considerable potential either. For that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average."
" It's terrible; and I loved the original comics from the start...
",0.4767,-0.8684,2017-06-11 00:00:00,1,"That's about all there is to say. Spoilers? Spoil what? The fact that it's crap? Listen, the original comics, written by Stan Lee before he became a complete sellout -- and much more importantly drawn by Steve Ditko the Great -- were amusing little takes on the pseudo-mysticism of the 60s; not ashamed to draw light vs. evil, etc., not ashamed to cast Asians as Asians (Tilda Swinton, I hereby summon your mother ship to come and take your freak self home). But now, with so many labored retakes and remakes and serious, pretentious treatments of the same general area...it's just exhausted. And not a note of humor in it, because Stan Lee doesn't have any humor, anymore, just big fat dollar signs rolling out of his mouth (and I know from personal experience). One more thing, Keira Cumberbatch: beware of overexposure. A lot of people who used to respect you are getting pretty damned sick of you selling out for every buck that comes along, and taking every part in sight. Remember Miss Knightly: nobody gives a damn about her, outside of the usual Pirates of the Caribbean fans, anymore. Virtue, as always, if found in occasional refusal and sticking to serious quality. Otherwise, in life as in your profession, you run the risk of appearing a whore... Although that risk may be long past, and the verdict in. Cumberbunny, indeed..."

I don't remember the last time I saw a great Marvel movie, and this is no exception.Someone apparently thought that making the main character an egotistical, arrogant, obnoxious, stuck-up snob was a good idea. I suppose there's a change of heart somewhere in the movie where (how original! we've never seen that before), to the ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" of the audience, he realizes the error of his ways and turns into mr. compassionate nice guy, but I missed it. He's a jerk throughout the movie. 0 for 1 so far.The bad guy has the acting skills of a cardboard box. He has about ten lines in the entire movie, which is a good thing as his English is atrocious. So nothing interesting in the villain department either. 0 for 2.Plot then, perhaps? Mmmkay... let's see. Evil bad guy steals pages from the Book of Doom (TM), which oddly enough openly sits in the library of the good guys, because they're gullible fools who blindly trust everyone who enters their monastery, which oddly enough sits in the middle of Nepal yet is populated exclusively by westerners and one or two token Asians. Evil guy wants to then summon the Demon of Doom (TM) who will give him immortality. Good guys have to stop him. Wow! What a breath of fresh air! Sigh. 0 for 3. Actually, if you count the absolutely dreadful and forced romantic relationship, 0 for 4.Finally, SFX? Err... other than some walls folding in on themselves (it appears that's the only spells these guys can cast), a Demon of Doom so bad it almost verges on comedy, and a gate spell that's used every 2 minutes and which looks like a kid waving a sparkle stick, nothing either.Trite, hackneyed junk. No interesting characters and a plot that's a joke - do yourself a favor and read a few old comics instead. Not the junk they put out these days, but something from the 70s or 80s."

" One of the best Marvel movies ever made
",0.7906,-0.8933,2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,"A few years ago when I found out that Benedict Cumberbatch was being cast as the title character in this movie I was totally against that choice because I felt that he didn't really look like Dr. Strange, but when I first saw the theatrical posters for this movie I immediately changed my mind. As the movie opens we see Strange and his girlfriend Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) who also happens to be a nurse at the same hospital where Strange works, and not to much later we see Strange get into a very dangerous car accident and suffers from severe nerve damage as a result of the accident. After Strange recovers he goes to a basketball court and talks to a man named Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who was paralyzed and tells Strange about this place in Turkey that allowed him to walk again. So Strange goes there and seeks help to heal his nerves meeting a man named Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and a monk called ""The Ancient One"" (Tilda Swinton) who teach him about the mystic arts. Strange is also required to read books on specific topics of sorcery and meets the librarian there named Wong (Benedict Wong).Then trouble arises and Strange has to fight a sorcerer who was taught by ""The Ancient One"" named Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his minions in order to save the world from ""The Dark Dimension"". The film was directed by Scott Derrickson who also co-wrote the screenplay with C. Robert Cargill and Jon Spaihts which all three of them did an effective job of focusing on the characters rather than on the fight scenes and special effects, and also at times the dialogue is completely hilarious. The performances are very good especially from Cumberbatch, McAdams, Ejiofor, Swinton, and Mikkelsen. The special effects are reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" (2010), and Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), but the only difference is that this movie didn't win its well deserved Oscar in the visual effects category even though Jon Favreau's ""The Jungle Book"" was a good choice but the special effects weren't as good as this movie. Though this isn't in my top ten movies of last year it is pretty close to making that list but this movie won't evade my memory anytime soon thanks to its greatness."

First time I watched it - it looked like half an hour, maybe there is really some ""time trick"" in Doctor's Strange fashion)Well, essentially it is Ben's show. Nothing wrong with it. Benedict Cumberbatch is very charismatic, to watch him on screen is always fun. His witty remarks, Dr. House style) his irony and sarcasm, and still - probably to attract audience - his Sherlock persona put right into the character of Stephen Strange, all of this is magic) Yes this movie looks like a stand-alone show of Benedict Cumberbatch. But it is somehow justified by the plot - Stephen Strange was always sort of a diva, egocentric genius, who lived like all the universe was moving around his sun. And he never changed. Rachel McAdams was very nice in her role of a protective girlfriend and the only ally Strange had in his life. Her role of the only satellite in the lonely galaxy of Strange's life should not be underrated and she's very likable in this movie.So, good things are, to sum it up. First - Benedict Cumberbatch, going on with his Sherlock persona - I think everyone who watched the Sherlock show were laughing watching the scene with the collar)) and some others scenes as well)) Second - Rachel McAdams as a loyal,trusting and beautiful character, supporting Doctor Strange in a way like Cameron tried to help Doctor House.Third - Very witty script, and good directing. And still let us be honest. What would this movie be without Ben, his sparkling witty sarcastic remarks and good job of directing? Well... it would be essentially a B-movie. Special effects are impressive and yet a bit boring with the same ""wrap'em buildings"" style. First time watching it looks impressive, second time - not so. All attempts on bringing some ""ancient wisdom"" and rebirth of a man into a perfect character are not convincing. Personnaly. for me it was a very harsh treatment of a desperate man. Stiil , I like this movie) Not for special effects, not for some Eastern philosophy but for the character Ben's so wonderfully played) As a fan of Marvel's movies, I have this movie in my list of favourites with the Avengers and first three X-Men) There is magic there, Marvel's magic)"
" Solid movie that doesn't deserve the amount of scorn
",-0.2732,0.9847,2017-06-05 00:00:00,8,"It's kind of interesting how drastically different my views towards this movie are compared to the rest. First of all, my mentality when watching the movie is not that the movie is ready for me (which it seems that the mass majority will do), but rather it's whether or not that I am ready for the movie.With that being said, I was mentally prepared for the movie beforehand (eg. expected cool GCI, fast-paced action, simple humour) so I knew what was coming, and admittedly I loved it. The character development is just right. It's not too shallow and not too over done which I hate (like c'mon, just get to the chase, no one cares about how or why the character did this or that). I especially loved Doctor Strange's arrogant ego in a way that I could actually feel what he was feeling. I also loved the added clich√©d humour.I don't really know what else to say other than the fact that I liked this movie. This movie is exactly what I expected, and exactly what I wanted. For the people who are reading this review, you are probably thinking ""ugh, whatever, this guy probably just loves those superficial, clich√©d, and heavily CGI'd movies"" and you're right, I like them. So what? Doesn't make me a person who has ""no taste"". It's purely a personal preference."

Overall the acting was well done.The not so good:Verged on too long with some slow spots.While the effects were well done, personally think they should have edited themselves a bit more.The origin story is relatively close to the original comic book version, which is good and bad.

In addition, we will wondering when is he going to appear: Thor Ragnar√∂k? Avengers: Infinity War? Spiderman Homecoming!!??The story is interesting, different from the previous Marvel ones. There aren't weapons or shootings here, but magic, inner power; which is good for a change, and more mysticism, which is really appealing for western people. The way the story is told is pretty good: the path is agile and there is nothing that feels like has been added just to fill time. The performers are all big name actors and actresses, all familiar faces which delight the audience with their characters, but of course, he who steals the spotlight is Mr Cumberbatch. No one would play better Dr Strange than him and we sincerely hope that he will appear in more movies to come.But the main and most important actors of this movie are the visual effects. Something absolutely breathtaking and that cannot make you look away from the screen. If Matrix was a before and an after, this one could be a another milestone in visual effects history. If you ever thing about forces and mystic around you this might be a way to imagine them that is for sure working out.A movie for Marvel lovers and for newcomers. It is entertaining, it is funny and it provides some inner thoughts, plus there is Cumberbitch, so go watch it while we wait for the next Marvel one!"

Dormammu is so lame, isn't he suppose to be one of your most powerful villains, Marvel? The final defeat was just insulting to me as a viewer. I felt they made this movie just to show us the green infinity stone so they can let us know there's an Infinity movie coming after they make a couple more of these brainwashed no good movies.

But this film seems to rob us of that movie just five minutes in. There is some great action here and there, but it happens so fast, before we can even take a breath, we're back in a hospital again. What's the point of being a wizard if you rely on your health insurance more than your magical powers?There are many redeeming moments throughout, and the good doctor could become an excellent vehicle for gorgeous visual material in future Avengers or Doctor Strange movies.

The same weapon renders gravity pointless yet during a key fight that exists only to show off repetitive special effects, our hero is running, sliding, falling etc... Defective mystical weapons?Astral plane... Where physics law still apply, where people fight as they would in physical form... Forget all you know yet the astral plane is exactly as you know it.There are two types of special effects: the kaleidoscope distortion and the conjuring or sparky light which can either be portals or weapons. These effects are used over and over and over and over and over again taking all the magic out of it.The way the real threat, a cosmic entity, is defeated isn't unlike two kids bickering and taunting each other, a scenario that could easily stop if one decided to turn away and pay no attention. If the said entity, a supreme being with infinite powers, simply chose to ignore Strange, I believe Strange would give up his plan once a zillion ... That would be spoiling it. The director made no secret he was inspired by The Matrix and Strange would have created what agent Smith did... All this terrible villain had to do is sit it out. Possibly one of the worst ending of any Marvel movie.I could go on but not without spoiling it. It's one for the kids and there's better things to watch on telly."

The majority of the film is a boring story about an arrogant doctor that is told that he needs to be more humble along with a bunch of kaleidoscope special effects and shifting landscapes/rooms around. There is very little of anything detailed of a story and the acting is all fairly dry and dead. They waste too much time at the beginning with establishing that he is a pompous jerk. The ""love relationship"" if there even is one is acted rather horribly. I have seen B-list movies that do a much better job with the acting for that part. It truly is amazing how people can enjoy this and give it good ratings but then hate and rundown other movies just because they get attacked with whitewashing propaganda in the media. The fact that the only main power that he uses is control over time is very lame and gives for very little action scenes. To top it off and make for the worst part of the movie; they didn't even have a battle scene at the end of the movie and he doesn't even fight the main enemy, all he does is trap the enemy(that is said to have control over time) in a time loop which makes no sense and making even less sense the superior being that should be used to the time issue gets restless and angry, they make a deal instead of Doctor Strange taking the time to learn more each death until he grows stronger & defeats him which provides the views with no entertainment at all."

The formula works, so why would we expect anything much to change. Benedict Cumberbatch is fine as the Doctor (although he seems to be channelling Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark during the more lighthearted parts of the film (especially the wisecracks)) as are Mads Mikkelsen and Tilda Swinton as the villain and the teacher respectively (admittedly not much is asked of them, the characters are pretty much props secondary to the CGI). I found the imagery, especially the mirror universe, initially interesting, but eventually it all began to look the same. Michael Giacchino's horn driven-music seemed out of place in a film featuring more mystic than martial heroics (and sounded too much like the theme from the current Star Treks for a film starring that franchise's 'Khan') and some parts of the film were just silly (the sentient cape comes to mind).

Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) is a former disciple of the Ancient One and has fallen under the influence of Dormammu of the Dark Dimension.This is the latest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Dr. Strange adds the strange side to the comic book franchise. Cumberbatch fills out the role. Every role is well cast. Even Tilda Swinton seems fitting in the otherworldly role. The CGI is brilliant. It is Inception plus. The battles are compelling without being confusing. Surprisingly, there is also humor. This is a solid addition to the MCU."

The first 20 minutes of the movie was all right, but after that it went downhill, with a ridiculous story, lack of proper explanation, and below average acting. Apart from the visual effects, the movie is utter crap. Usually comic book based movies, even when the story involves magic, tries to include at least a minimum level of rationality in the plot(like Thor for example) but the story of this movie didn't even keep up to that minimum level. The only thing I liked about the movie was the presence of Benedict Cumberbatch(His acting was good as always).If you like visual effects, then you may watch it but that's all you're gonna get. Everything else, especially the story, is just terrible. Apparently, as long as there are visual effects in an MCU movie, people give it good ratings irrespective of the quality of the story."

To me it's to experience something unique, entertaining, just to have fun. Almost every studio these days, it's all about the NEXT film, the bigger and better film. With Doctor Strange it comes to a new level, it's got flare, originality and that's why I think it's above most comic book films.Don't get me wrong I adore the team films and I love sequels but one day for me they'll get boring, that's why we need films like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange to show we can have original concepts yet still strive in a larger universe. The greatness of the film of course comes from it's ability to have an excellent story and it's visual storytelling to be through the roof.Let me first say that in my opinion Benedict Cumberbatch is a superb actor who gives an outstanding performance as Dr. Strange, who at times is an ass but at the same time he's able to portray him as sympathetic. He allows his character to ""consume"" him and gives his whole which shows and results in him becoming one of my favorite characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Despite the lack of her in the first half Rachel McAdams also gives a great performance outside her usual rom-com roles. She wasn't one of those defenseless love interests, she had a part to play and I love that. All three of the mystic team; Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and Tilda Swinton, as the infamous ""Ancient One"" are all fantastic in their own rights as well. Mads Mikkelsen, oh my god, he is so good in this. I've seen him in close to nothing and now I want to watch every things he's in.Scott Derrickson, who I've never seen a film from, manages to have all these components put together beautifully and uses slick and smooth direction to enhance the experience and result in a hell-of-a ride. His pairing with the best cinematography I've seen all year result in the most beautiful looking film all year. Okay but seriously Doctor Strange has the best visuals I've seen in along time. It's just oozes magnitude. I was in shock and in awe for every sequence, my eyes were glued to the screen and I was so happy for that.Although it follows the mainstream marvel origin story, Doctor Strange still manages to not feel like every other superhero movie. Of all the Marvel Studios' origin story's like Iron Man and Thor thankfully Doctor Strange is in the top tier. I'm really excited to see where the MCU takes this character because he has a lot of potential and had a great start here."

The computer graphics will blow your mind esp., if you are watch it in 3D. The story is plain and we will come to know what happens next in the first 45 minutes itself.Rest is all about how the lead actor saves the world from evil.With an age old story line, an effective screen play might have made the movie even better. But somehow, I found the scenes too shallow with the whole of attention on the CGI stuffs. Even that gets boring after a while where the same spell is being used over and over. The climax is good and well thought but I don't know how the evil of all evils simply made a school kids like deal, just for a simple reason of getting escaped. It made me laugh.There are some good thoughts shared. Mind control is one area which I felt is noteworthy! Overall, a decent one time watch.

With so many films in growing cinematic universes constantly throwing in references to upcoming characters in order to set up that universe, it is good to see a movie that has its own self-contained story. No Tony Stark or Thor (except for the post-credits scene, but that's a little different), just Stephen Strange and his world. The casting is also very good. Benedict Cumberbatch provides a very convincingly arrogant and privileged guy who realized he might be wrong after all by the time the movie is coming to a close. He's still flawed, but at least he's trying.. There was only a small handful of things that could have been improved. The pacing started out a little odd. I feel like it could have taken more time to develop all of the characters and their world. It did even out quickly, though. Again, a bit of a generic villain, but Kacaelius was not as threatening as he could have been. I don't think it was as bad as most people say however. The story of Doctor Strange is not as interesting to me as some of the other Marvel stories, so it was not my #1 favorite MCU installment, but it was still very good"

Well I am kind of in between here. This one is much better than a dreadful one where two teams of super heroes actually both lose in the movie. It is a notch short of some of Marvels best efforts. That is why Stan Lee is on a bus on this one. He is trying to stay out of the way and yet laugh all the way to the bank. Successful, Lee is.The movie makes it because Dr. Strange actor pulls off his role pretty well. It does get a little deep in all the fighting and action sequences. The bald lady comes off very much like that old lady who is in charge of James Bond in the last few outings.The movie is predictable, and yet enjoyable. Could it be better, yes, and the feelings between Strange and his estranged wife are not very emotional. Of course who has room for emotions when you need to save the entire world?This is one of the places the emotion is lacking a bit. The characters do the best they can with the script, but it could have been better. The ending credits contain 2 surprises, and one thing that is not surprising. There are only about 4 songs that get credits in this one because Dr. Strange is just not very musical.Maybe that is a sour note, but it depends on what you like, You could say that in a diner, this movie is the blue plate special, better than a plain cheese sandwich, but not a prime rib sandwich. Then again in some eateries, the Blue Plate is the prime rib. It's just left over from yesterday's special."
" The worse movie in the series so far because it wants you to believe that magic on earth is the most natural thing and every human being is cable of practising it.
",-0.079,0.9478,2017-04-16 00:00:00,5,"One major problem with this film: why is your world plausible and what makes Doctor Strange the chosen one. Are you telling me that everyone that walked in that temple could have learned magic like that? Captain America and Hulk are products of science, Iron Man of Money, Thor of his alieness and goddess but what about Doctor Strange? He is suborn, arrogant and ambitious and that's why he is the chosen one? Well so are at least 5 million other people in planet earth. The magic had no back up here, its Earth why should there be magic? Are you expected to be childish and believe it just like that? Nope. Real-life link: Everyone has a reason for his/her action. Kaecilius believes he is saving the world because he has been lied by his teacher. Of course he is going to question everything she has taught him. Trust was betrayed. A villain with not a villain aim, just a greedy one. Plausibility: The worse part of this movie. For a movie like this it is crucial that you back up your fantasy world. Why is magic possible on Earth? Every normal human being can practice magic if it enters that temple now and can see the spirit out of body? This is just ridiculous. The worse part was when Strange's spirit talks to Christine like it is the most natural thing ever for humans. Hated that. If that magic was possible because of the infinity stone that would make the movie awesome but no, it just expects us to believe that every human can do magic and magic is the most natural thing on earth. Villain: Strong. Double Villain. The former student turned bad and the overall villain of all the Marvel Movies. They can't beat either of them and that is what makes them strong. Kaecilius could only be beaten because Dormammu takes him and Dormammu can not be beaten at all, he only accepts a deal that sets him free and that's how the earth is saved. Storytelling: Strong. Keeps you interested. Starts with the life of Strange, the accident and his pursue to get his old life back. He learning magic seems a bit rushed (he is a natural dah) but the end is unpredictable and surprises you, you don't know how they will safe the earth. A great surprise is to learn that Kaecilius was actually right and the perfect accent one is not so perfect since she draws energy from the dark dimension, the same dimension she fights. Character development: Strange learns that there are many ways to safe the world. At the end of the day he looses nothing. All the control he had as being the best doctor, that is not multiplied by millions since he is now saving the world. Arrogance still there I'd say. Acting/Casting: Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent choice. Makes an arrogant character likable. Overall, the worse Marvel movie so far, not because of its story or characters but because it wants you to believe that magic on earth is the most natural thing and every human being is cable of practising it."
" Strange where the storyline went off to...
",-0.2023,0.9883,2017-04-15 00:00:00,5,"This was definitely a comic book story long in the waiting for a transition to the big screen, and I am sure that many fans of the comic book and the Marvel universe were thrilled with this movie. I, however, am not a fan of superheroes in any shape or form, and just watched this movie because I had a chance to do so with my wife.Once the movie ended and the sparks and flashing effects left my eyes with a proper sight again, I can in all honesty say that this was a shallow and pointless movie, and there were so many plot holes that even a Swizz cheese would be jealous. But luckily enough there was so many grand and amazing effects on the screen to divert your attention from all the plot holes and the lack of a proper thought-through storyline.Personally I am not overly much a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, and I don't really get the hype around him. He is not all that impressive. And one would think that I would be thrilled about seeing Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen in this movie, but I wasn't. He was just browsing through this as if he had seen through all the flaws and shortcomings that the script had.And with my lack of interest in superhero movies, then ""Dr. Strange"" is a movie that just came and went without leaving any impression or lasting mark, unlike ""Logan"" for example. And it is definitely not a movie that I will pick up again and sit down to watch. Why? Because the story just barely had enough contents to support the first viewing.Instead of just spewing out superhero movies by the dozen, Marvel Studios should take the time to get some proper script writers to pen out the stories for the movies they want to put on the big screen.Even though ""Dr. Strange"" was heavily loaded with special effects, it was just a shallow experience of a movie all in all. As such, my rating of this 2016 addition to the Marvel movie universe is a mere mediocre 5 out of 10 stars, based mostly on the special effects."

I am starting to wonder if the Marvel bubble won't so much burst as it will shrivel up in a slow, sad demise, if this latest installment is anything to go by.I had very high hopes for Doctor Strange. Marvel movies are starting to get formulaic, it is possibly the most famous criticism now, and what could be more of a gear change and shake up than removing all the techno-babble, shrinking suits and super serums and have magic instead. Mystical, spiritual energies, other dimensions; a melting pot of possibilities and quite likely the glue to a much bigger Cinematic Universe that can finally leap from our own world. With a strong actor playing a character who is the antithesis of all those things, how can it go wrong?They found a way.Director Scott Derrickson is more synonymous with horror films: The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Sinister and Deliver Us from Evil making for three of the five films he has directed. The film starting off with a near-silent scene in a mystical library, only to have a man beheaded by our film's stock villain Kaecilius (who is sure to join the ranks of forgotten Marvel villains) you might think that this is going to be a Marvel film with a different tone. Progress further still and we have some surprisingly drawn out and sober hospital surgery scenes, the first act climaxing with the doctor's accident.But then things take a turn for the Thor: Dark World. While Benedict Cumberbatch fits the role, as do the other actors (including Tilda Swinton, her character's Celtic origins literally explained in the script) the script is wooden and utterly forgettable. So much exposition and meaningless explanations was quite possibly the worst angle to approach this new dimension of the MCU. Even the humour seems forced at times.Surely the action is good? Sometimes. Remember the fight scenes in Batman Begins? The ones that are all elbows and mid-sections, without giving the audience a clue to what is happening? Yeah. Imagine that, only with energy weapons that dazzle lights everywhere. And the action is taking place on a Transformer. A Transformer the size of Manhattan.Don't get me wrong, the kaleidoscopic warping effects that dazzled in the trailer is great. For the first ten minutes. Inception pulled off rotating corridors and endless stairwells in two ways that Doctor Strange does not: by conserving the 'wow' moments, not splurging them all over the place constantly, and by using practical effects. Am I just getting old, or are people blind to shoddy CGI now? Both this and Civil War have had glaring problems with CGI. What takes me out of an experience? A bendy Benedict Computerbatch bouncing around harmlessly in rotating corridors and over floating platforms that do not exist.I felt really put out by Doctor Strange. Marvel's track record for ""origin stories"" is really high, but this feels more like the wayward and overconfident sequel. Elements are good, Cumberbatch is good; the first act is solid setup and gives old Sherlock a lot to work with. The costumes and set designs are decent. I can see these elements being used better in future Marvel films. The final reality-bending trick was cool too, despite being desensitized to it all by that point, and the gratefully small amount of tethering to the MCU was welcome too. Some nice little nods (like seeing the Avenger tower in the city skyline) that make it feel connected without needless cameos.But the pacing is a frightful mess. I didn't feel like the characters went through sensible transitions of development; the plot just took leaps when it needed to and the characters just accept things when they need to.It's fun and entertainment is only skin deep, and the future quality of Marvel Studios productions can be called into question."
" Excellent magical fireworks display
",0.5719,0.8121,2017-04-12 00:00:00,10,"It is actually quite some time since I watched Doctor Strange but somehow the movie must have slipped between the cracks since I appear to have forgotten to review it. So I am about to remedy that now. To put it in simple terms: This is an excellent movie. It is a wonderful display of magical fireworks with a decent enough story to keep it together.I have to confess that I have not really read many of the comics containing Doctor Strange so it is a bit difficult for me to comment on the aspect of the film versus the comics. From the little that I have read I got the impression that the comic book version of Doctor Strange was a wee bit more dark, serious and mature. This movie starts from the beginning of his career though so I guess there is some justification for the less mature Doctor Strange in the movie.Doctor Strange is a skilled neurosurgeon but a bit of an asshole. Actually more than ""a bit"". He gets involved in a accident, that he pretty much causes himself due to his arrogance. Fast forward to the interesting chapter were we get to see Doctor Strange being, reluctantly, admitted into a scruffy looking monastery on the other side of the planet. That is when the fun starts. Doctor Strange is in for a ride. Slowly Doctor Strange gets knocked into him that magic exists and he is expected to practice it.The time at the monastery, or perhaps we should call it a school, leads to a few funny episodes and I do like the head monk's bantering with Strange and the way she does things. Talk about getting thrown into the deep end of the swimmingpool first. Strange's continued arrogance and immaturity is a bit annoying from time to time though. That has to be said.What is the use of super heroes if there are no bad guys around. So after Strange having trained for a while, and mostly failed miserably, the bad guys starts to crash the party. So no more pretty living room magic for Strange. It is time to go head to head with some serious competition. Unfortunately, for a good chunk of the first fights Strange mostly falls on his arse. They are still cool and beautiful to watch though.Slowly Strange starts to get to grip with this whole magic thing and he also starts to shed some of that arrogance of his and take some responsibility. About time since the despicable bad guy are, of course, working towards freeing the real BIG bad guy, father of all evil and mother of everything else bad you can think of. Time for a showdown.As the fighting escalates so does the user of special effects and personally I though the special effects were both beautiful and spectacular. I really liked them.I am not sure Cumberbatch would have been my first choice for Doctor Strange though. To me he do not really project the image of the wise and skilled Wizard I expected. He is not bad though. The only other person that stood out for me was the chief monk and The Ancient One which I also quite liked. The rest of the characters, well to me they mostly lived in the shadows of these two, even though they were in general likable and sometimes fun.There were a few rather hilarious parts where Strange has to reveal the truth about what he stepped in to his former girlfriend. I have a soft spot for the surprise moments in both movies and books.I rather not get started on time travel since I generally hate it as a story element since it almost always leads to paradoxes or is simply so poorly done that it is blatantly obvious that someone tried to cover up for a lazy and shoddy story. However I guess I have to mention that screwing around with time is an important part of the plot in this movie. Luckily it is done in such a way that it do not, in my opinion, negatively impact the movie. Actually, to my surprise, it is used in a rather cool way.So, bottom line, a movie I liked quite a lot. 5 out 5 stars kind worth of liking."

" Mystical Marvel
",0.4215,0.9911,2017-04-08 00:00:00,10,"If you're a fan of the Marvel Universe films that have transpired over the past decade or so then be prepared to go someplace they haven't until now. Most of those films have transpired in our known world, a world of reality. But Marvel Comics fans always knew there was another world to be covered, a world of the supernatural. With the release of DOCTOR STRANGE we are finally given our first taste of that world.Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Doctor Stephen Strange, an egotistical surgeon with tremendous skills who waste no time with hopeless cases, instead focusing on only cases that can be put in the plus column. The film opens giving us a glimpse into that personality as well as the only potential love interest he's had in his life, Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). They may have parted ways but the affection has remained.After a day at work and on his way to a catered affair Strange runs off the road and crashes his car and his hands in the process. He wakes to find his hands encased in plaster and rods with the outlook for his returning to work as a surgeon highly in doubt. After pursuing several paths to healing he eventually remembers a man who seemed to walk when there was no hope of his ever doing so. This leads him to the Far East and a city known as Kamar-Taj. It is here that Strange is brought in to the mystical world of the supernatural.Brought into the city by Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), one of the sorcerers who protects the world, Strange is introduced to the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). She shows him that there is more to the world than just the physical by taking him out of his body and into the astral world. When he returns he begs to be taught more.The film builds on this displaying Strange' training as well as helping the viewer to understand more what this mystical world is all about. Realities are altered, perception is a hindrance and magic is real. Strange is taught not just how to move from one location to another via portal but how to defend himself as well in preparation of protecting himself and the world around him.A short sequence at the film's opening saw a page from an ancient book stolen by Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), a zealot with a few followers who has left Kamar-Taj with ill intent. Strange is shown that there are 3 locations in the world that connect to protect it from evil, one each in London, New York and Hong Kong. While learning this the London center is destroyed and New York is under attack by Kaecilius and his group. The blast suffered while watching London fall has tossed Strange into the New York center and he battles to protect it, even having an ancient artifact attach to him and become his weapon.This is merely the first battle between good and evil. More is at stake here, in fact the entire world is at stake as Kaecilius attempts to provide an opening for Dormammu the ruler of the Dark Dimension. Friends and alliances are built, trust is destroyed and more is learned as Strange moves forward. The eventual showdown fills the climax of the film delivering the punch one has come to expect from a Marvel film.As a fan of comics for some time I've enjoyed every film Marvel has turned loose on the world. They have captured the fun, the excitement and the full color world seen on paper for decades and transferred those to the screen with a love of the source material. Rather than turn their back on the comics these movies came from they embrace them. That is well in evidence here in DOCTOR STRANGE.If you've read the comics then you know what to expect as Strange moves into the world of the mystical universe. As I watched Strange enter the Dark Dimension I sat mesmerized as the images from those comics were brought to life on screen. Even in past Marvel films nothing has equaled this when it comes to capturing has until now only been seen on those pages. It was amazing to see.This movie is so well rounded, combining just the right amount of pathos, humor, action, revelation and story that you can't help but be drawn in. Cumberbatch shows that he is not a one note actor sitting back and collecting praise for his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. While he remains loyal to that program he shows here that he can take on more roles and do them well just as he has with several other film projects. As with Hugh Jackman who took on the role of Wolverine one would be hard pressed to consider anyone else in the role of Doctor Strange after watching this film. The entire cast brings their characters to life in the best way possible. For me the sign of great acting is not realizing you're watching actors. All offer that type of performance here.DOCTOR Strange for me is one of those super hero movies that you can pull off the shelf and watch at any given moment. When it ends you long for the next chapter, the next film in which Strange will appear. Word is he will be involved in the AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR film coming next year. Until then we'll have to spend our time with this film.An added note. As with most Marvel films don't shut this one off as the credits roll. There are two teasers to be found here, one as they finish."
" Getting Some Strange
",-0.2023,0.9846,2017-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Doctor Strange: I hate going to the movie theater nowadays. It isn't that the experience is so much worse than it was back in the good old days when men were men, children were well behaved and people dressed for going out in public. It simply is that my home theater experience is gotten so much better. Surround sound, my own snacks, my own choice of company and a decent 4k OLED screen make for a mighty fine home viewing experience. Sometimes though a movie comes out that makes we wish I had seen it in the theater. Doctor Strange is one such movie. The special effects and design are so wonderfully trippy. The story is your standard origin story with the put-upon love interest (an underused Rachel McAdams), A cocky self-assured millionaire learning a life lesson, and even a touch of ye olde chosen one. It's all the other wonderful stuff that makes the movie. Director Scott Derrickson isn't afraid to let his imagination run wild everything from acid trips to body horror to Inception called and they want their movie back is featured.While this movie is not peak Marvel it is better than it had to be and certainly better than it could have been. A fun visually impressive well acted movie."
" Enough with origin stories?
",0.0,-0.9897,2017-04-08 00:00:00,4,"This is not terrible film but its not good either. Maybe I am just getting bored of origin films but I certainly found myself getting bored with this film. Most of it has been done before, not that long ago, and many times better.The film makes a big mistake early on by introducing the antagonist with a fight that he is losing, this is just poor story telling as its hard to see the antagonist as much of a challenge after this. Cumberbatch does a reasonable job as the hero but a lot of the jokes fail to land (something that is even lamp-shaded). Tilda Swinton is completely unconvincing in the mentor role. Her performance reminded me of Gabriel in Constantine and whilst it worked brilliantly in that role she just felt paper thin in this role (to be fair it might be the writing not the performance).Where this film really loses the plot is with the effects, I'm not against CGI but good effects should be there to enhance the story and immerse us in the world. In this case however the effects are often jarring and confusing. Its hard to follow a fight scene when the world is shifting all the time in the background. Finally I have to question why they put time manipulation in the film, I thought it was because this was the main power of the comic book character but apparently not. The trouble with time travelling and time manipulation is that its incredibly hard to do well, it often robs the story of gravity because of the lack of consequences of your actions when you can just rewind or go back in time. This film fell into that trap with both feet and the final 'showdown' was completely unrewarding as a result."
" Superb Visuals Accompanied by a Solid Script
",0.6908,0.9975,2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Doctor Strange follows a surgeon who, after suffering from a major injury, sets out to search for healing. Instead, he ends up learning about magic. The movie opens with a scene that is both darker and funnier than most Marvel superhero movies I've seen. It sets the tone really well, and it actually manages to carry that all the way through. It is comedic, yet it maintains a level of urgency or threat to the entire situation that the characters constantly find themselves in, keeping the audience intrigued for most the entire duration. The special effects were probably the biggest selling point for this movie. For me, anyway. I made a point of getting it on blu-ray, and it paid off. The effects are pretty trippy (for lack of a better word), and that's really all I'm going to say about them. I wasn't sure they always made sense in the context of the movie, but they were still pretty cool. Unlike other Marvel superhero movies I've seen recently, this one is actually funny. The character of Stephen Strange is actually fleshed-out and realistic to an extent. He's an engaging character with plenty of faults and just as much charm. He's a fun character, and I get the feeling Eggs Benedict Cucumberpatch felt the same. In fact, basically the entire cast seems to be having a jolly ol' time making the movie. There's just this air of fun surrounding it. The writing is actually pretty good, with dialogue that comes expected of a particular character, and a plot driven in a direction that makes sense and ceases to be boring. I never found myself questioning a character's decisions due to pure stupidity, nor did I find myself dozing like I have through the last few movies. It manages to build an intriguing world without revealing too much or boring the audience with lore and exposition, yet it gives us just enough to keep us interested. Overall Doctor Strange is both fun and funny, clever and pretty, well acted and well-written, and is just an all-around great movie. It's a step in the right direction for Marvel, and I'm hoping to see them continue in this direction. In the end I would recommend this movie."

Another MARVEL comic book has entered the very crowded space for superheroes and CGI dominance - this time it is DOCTOR STRANGE and the combination of fantasy and special effects and very fine script writing and a superb cast (directed by co-author Scott Derrickson) is a winner. Or as the PR states, Marvel's ""Doctor Strange"" follows the story of the talented neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) who, after a tragic car accident leaving his talented hands useless, must put ego aside and learn the secrets of a hidden world of mysticism and alternate dimensions in a lace in Katmandu called Kamar-Taj in search of a cure, but instead discovers the mystical arts and becomes a powerful sorcerer battling dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Based in New York City's Greenwich Village, Doctor Strange must act as an intermediary between the real world and what lies beyond, utilizing a vast array of metaphysical abilities and artifacts to protect the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Leaving his female interest (Rachel McAdams) he encounters a fellow traveler Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Wong (Benedict Wong), the evil Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelson), and the true star of the film The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). The special effects enhance the story as well as any fantasy movie around, but it is the wry sense of humor as well as the intelligence of Benedict Cumberbatch that makes the film a welcome addition to the Marvel Comics spectrum. The Ending with a brief conversation between Doctor Strange and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) assures us this is a 'to be continued' series.Even for those fatigued by the overkill of Marvel Comics films, this one is an infusion of fresh air.

" Strange, strange; has its merits, including Cumberbatch, and its minuses
",0.0258,0.9947,2017-03-27 00:00:00,7,"Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) has a big problem with egomania. A top neurosurgeon in NYC, he does work miracles but, his ego is enormous. Needless to say, his attitude prevents others from liking him, including another surgeon, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) who the doctor seems to admire. Yet, pride goes before a fall, as they say. One fateful night, Strange drives too fast in his hot sports car, while talking on the phone, and he crashes. It's horrendous. Yes, he's alive, but his hands are badly damaged and to a surgeon, that's the universe. After extensive physical therapy, his hands remain shaky. Desperate, he learns that a paralyzed man now walks again, after a trip to Nepal. With his finances extremely low, Dr. Stephen nevertheless takes the trip to the faraway land, searching for The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). He almost doesn't make it until he is saved on the street by Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor). What luck! Mordo is also trained in the mystical healing and brings Dr. Strange to his supreme teacher. Strange's ego is still inflated and The Ancient One has to be convinced to offer him hope. After studying chakras, amulets and other long-forgotten abilities, Doctor Strange is reborn. However, not to surgery, as there is a more pressing matter. A former apprentice, Caesillius (Mads Mikkelsen) of the Ancient One is causing tremendous problems on earth. Dr. Strange's first mission may be to try and stop this formidable foe. Can he do it with the help of Mordo, The Ancient One, and another mystic named Wong? First, I do not watch many superhero movies as they are not my preferred view but, finding Cumberbatch a very compelling performer, I chose this one. Mr. Benedict does not disappoint, as he is a very handsome and talented actor. Likewise, the other thespians are first rate, especially Swinton. But, I was hoping to see a movie where a superhero uses his unique powers to rescue average folks and, somewhere along the way, get the girl. This does not happen. In addition, while the special effects may have been better on the big screen, on my paltry 20 inch they were busy, confusing, overworked. In other words, they did not enhance the tale for this viewer. Perhaps there will be sequels, where Doctor Strange has a chance to save the world and romance ladies at the same time. Til then, its a mixed bag of entertainment."
" Unusual Marvel Movie
",0.4215,0.9913,2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Dr. Strange is a sorcerer and this is his origin film. There have been enough super hero movies, that we all understand how this works. Someone kind of normal (but who has either extraordinary smarts or nobility) gets gifted (or troubled (the Stan Lee vision)) with extraordinary power and must overcome personal consideration to accept the now famous maxim best articulated by Uncle Ben, ""With great power comes great responsibility"".Stan Lee was to comic books in the 1960's what Bob Dylan was to music. He churned out an exceptionally wide and diverse set of genre expanding works. I've always found that origin tales, like the first Spiderman, the first Ironman, the first Captain America are can't miss movies because the stories are simple hero stories and Stan Lee and his team created a number of great characters who's stories just convert directly into a movie so well. I have to admit that I don't really know or remember the Dr. Strange origin story, and am not that familiar with the character from the comics to judge how directly this movie correlates to the old comic.And to me, that gives us the first of a number of problems with this movie. We've seen this before. An arrogant self-absorbed super genius. Basically the Tony Stark of doctors.The next problem is how rushed everything seems as we run down the super hero to be checklist. 1. Establish a villain with a prologue. 2. Establish the vanity / flaw of our character. 3. He gets taken down by fate. We get about a five minutes for each one. It seems very rushed Then he heads off to solve his problem. He goes from a green recruit, not accepting and humble. boom...they throw him a curve-ball and he overcomes it. boom...next time we look somehow (because of his natural aptitude) he is top of the class. boom....just when he figures he go-ts what he wants...the villain shows up. (This is slight spoiler: Actually as he is saying the words, ""I didn't do this to become part of some cosmic war"". The cosmic war starts.) So, they have compressed the whole narrative into the most linear story they could.I think that they could have alleviated this by using a flashback. In this case, Dr. Strange could have been battling the villain at the beginning, and then they could have taken us back through the process it took to get him to where he winds up. This especially would have worked since this time, time is an important element in the plot of this movie.The CGI special effects didn't win me over. First, Dark City and a few other movies have worked this M.C. Escher twisting physical reality concept before, and all though visually stunning, they come across as slightly silly at times. I give them some leeway here, because like I said, I don't know the Dr. Strange backstory well enough to know if these visuals are a sweet spot for fans of the original comic. I assumed they were.The cast of this movie is absolutely tremendous, and it's unfortunate that none of them get enough screen time or an expanded enough character to really shine. But, these actors are great throughout and they definitely don't hurt the movies credibility.There are a few small tie-ins at the end to the bigger Marvel Universe and the Infinity Stones and the coming war.Nothing wrong with this movie except the rushed feeling of the story and the linear cookie cutter steps it takes us down. but...hey, it's about a Mystical Super Hero."

The movie has a weak story with weaker characters and depends too heavily on impressive graphics and humor.

So I don't know how true it is to its source material. But divorced from that material, I found this a reasonably entertaining piece of nonsense that felt like it could have been better.The movie begins with a terrific opening scene in which people fight on the side of a building which is turning in on itself. Weird stuff happening with architecture is a common theme in the movie and is consistently entertaining.Then we meet Cumberbatch as a brilliant, arrogant surgeon whose golden hands are destroyed in an accident. Soon he discovers a temple in Katmandu that he believes can help him. It is headed by Tilda Swinton, and my response to that was, immediately, why is this white lady in charge of an Asian temple? This turns out to have been part of the Asian whitewashing complaints, but ignoring that entirely, it just seems weird, and goes totally unaddressed in the film.It is one of various small things that added together weaken the film. Another is the magical cape that makes an appearance. Again, I'm not familiar with the original comic books, but the cape in the movie seems like the silliest superweapon ever. It's played for laughs, which is perhaps the only option with something like this, but the cape slapstick felt out of place with the movie overall.The story itself feels a bit rushed. I got little sense of the villains or the actual stakes, and various ideas and twists were just kind of tossed out and never adequately pursued. Strange goes from jerk to hero without much actual character development.What saves the movie from its many flaws are some terrific set pieces, including a fight that takes place while time is reversing, and those crazy architecture battles. The action and special effects are quite good, Cumberthatch does a solid job, and the movie has a sprightly sense of humor. So overall I did like it. But I feel like there was potential for something better. Maybe they'll do better for the sequel?"

The special effects are very well done and sometimes stunning. There are a lot of visual effects that work really good in this story. I'm also not a major fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, unlike others, but in this movie he did a good job. The whole cast is enjoyable to watch. The movie might be long but you never have the feeling that it's getting boring or so. And that's mainly due to the stunning sometimes psychedelic visual effects. You'd better not take any LSD before watching Doctor Strange. They could make more movies about this Marvel character and I will watch them in the hope they are at least as good as this one."

Throwing in time reversal, mystic dimensional shifts, magic vs. hard science ‚Äì even all that has been done to death.

Turns out, it was a huge hit, and now that I've seen it, I would rank it as one of the more entertaining comic book movies. The visuals were absolutely eye popping, but the story had me 100% invested in seeing how it would turn out. It's also one of the fastest paced movies I've ever seen, moving along at breakneck speed for the first half. It has great action, an interesting main character, and I even like the subject matter, particularly the idea that there are things we don't see all around us unless we can expand our minds. This movie does what all movies ought to aim to do."
" Doctor Strange Review
",-0.2023,0.802,2017-03-22 00:00:00,8,"It seems this is the going to be the last Origins Story in the MCU, or at least that is the word going round. Guess they are just going to introduce the other characters from here on out. I'm fine with that. The origin stories are starting to become the exact same stories. Not saying Doctor Strange is a bad movie though. Here's why.Synopsis: After a horrible car accident, brilliant neurosurgeon Stephen Strange must find a way and a cure to healing his hands. His quest brings him to Kamar-Taj in Nepal where he studies under the Ancient One, who teaches him the ways of magic and alternate realities. With new skills of interdimensional travel and spells, Strange soon discovers that he must protect the world from a deadly enemy who is out to destroy it. Starring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tilda Swinton Director: Scott DerricksonReally, the reason I did give this movie an 8 is because of the origin story. It took more than half the movie to get to the main conflict. It all concentrated on how Strange got his power. I would have rather seen more of the cosmicverse. They hinted it at in Ant- Man and brought it full force here. Now, they just need to concentrate on it more.Benedict was the right choice for the role. I really can't see anyone else playing Strange. Nobody has that swagger that he has to pull off the cockiness of Strange. I can't wait to see him square off with Tony.Other than Benedict all the characters were one dimensional. Not the writers fault, most of the secondary characters in the Strange comics are one dimensional. At least from what I remember. Haven't read one of his since the turn of the century.There was nothing that stood out in this movie besides the visual effects. The movie was just on average with all the rest of the MCU. Albeit a vital part to the MCU.Final Thoughts: If it wasn't vital, this movie could have stood alone. Comparing it to the other movies it doesn't stand on its own. But still watchable.Rating: 8 out of 10That's it for me folks. If you would like to continue to follow my post, go ahead and like this page.

As is typical of films of the Marvel genre, the CGI and special effects dominate the film. Seems to borrow from Dark City, a true trend setter, in many ways.

" Marvel might be the Shakespeare of our times
",0.4215,0.9375,2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,"There is a branch of historians arguing that Shakespeare actually wasn't a single person, but a collective of writers publishing their work under the name of a fictional persona. I sometimes wonder whether Marvel is today what Shakespeare was back then. There is barely any Marvel movie which isn't a work of great craftsmanship and fun to ingest while retelling classical conflicts of drama in a fresh way reflecting the postmodern or post postmodern or post whatever times we live in. DOCTOR STRANGE delves deep into the depths of mysticism, catches bits of esoteric knowledge and pseudo knowledge, mystical techniques and philosophic mind over matter conceptions, and cooks a wild, bright, colorful meal out of it back at the surface, spiced up with the usual myriad of references for example pointing to the MATRIX (Kaecillius and consorts walking just like Neo & co), martial arts flicks (the fights, the zooms) and 2001 - A SPACE ODYSEE (the dimensional shifts). The film uses expressionistic, fat brush strokes so to speak, working with strong contrasts and hyper stylized exaggerations. It does it with charming elegance, never slipping into the muddy traps of ridiculous trash. DOCTOR STRANGE can be an inspiration. I can't help but liking it."
" A Drug Free Psychedelic Ride!
",0.5562,0.9322,2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Caught this one last evening On-Demand. I was hooked from the beginning until the end! The opening scene will definitely catch your attention, too. Dr. Strange tells a story of Dr. Stephen Strange, considered to be the best neurosurgeon in the world. Well, at least that's what HE thinks. Arrogant, aloof, and overbearing as all get out, it is safe to say Dr. Strange is just about void of friends and/or relationships. This is where the movie gets a little ""tricky"" because Strange's character comes off as such an a-hole, I thought I might not finish the movie. That can be attributed to Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Dr. Strange. He is simply wonderful. However, as the Fates usually have it, Dr. Strange is involved in a horrible auto accident and both his hands--and his world--are shattered. It is during his convalescence when he stumbles upon what he thinks is an urban legend regarding a man involved in an accident who had severe (and untreatable) injuries to his spine, yet was seen walking in New York. When Dr. Strange listens to this man's story about his ""spiritual"" healing, he then sets out to see if he can help himself. He travels to Nepal (Kathmandu) and encounters ""The Ancient One,"" expertly played by Tilda Swinson, and his ""journey"" begins.""Dr. Strange"" is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Expertly cast and directed, the movie tells a very engaging story-- something most ""Marvel"" movies do not. All the characters were interesting, the special effects were indeed very special, and I was captivated until the end. Rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images, I recommend this one for everyone. Hope you enjoy!"

That's not a knock, just an observation. McDonalds may make more than just hamburgers, but even their chicken sandwiches taste like McDonalds, if you catch my meaning. Here we swap super serums and rocket-powered¬†armor in favor of hocus pocus. There's a patina of difference, but nothing substantive.With a connect the dots origin story and an extremely weak and undercooked villain, it's up to star Benedict Cumberbatch to carry the load, and thankfully he's up to the task. His Stephen Strange has more in common with Tony Stark than Steve Rogers, and his journey from arrogant, self serving doctor to hero is made believable thanks in large part to Cumberbatch.

" The Marvel formula lives on
",0.4215,0.9552,2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"Once upon a time there was a conceited rich man who frequently cracked jokes at other people's expense. However, he only got away with it because of his status and that he happened to be brilliantly good at what he did. However, his charmed existence all came to an end when a tragic accident happened to him which forced him to re-evaluate the way he'd been living his life and, in turn, made him into the superhero he is today. His name¬Ö was Tony 'Iron Man' Stark. Or do I mean Dr Strange? Actually, it doesn't matter ‚Äì it's basically the same film. I may be being a bit flippant, but, when you're basically copying the original 'Iron Man' film, it can't be that bad. And it isn't.'Dr Strange' is yet another superhero movie in Marvel's ‚Äì seemingly ‚Äì never ending connected cinematic universe. Here we have Benedict Cumberbatch taking on the titular role as an arrogant (but brilliant!) surgeon who gets his career (and life) dashed when he's involved in a horrific car accident and therefore loses the use of his hands¬Ö and therefore livelihood. However, all is not lost ‚Äì a trip to a spiritual guru on the other side of the world turns the arrogant Dr Stephen Strange into the 'Sorcerer Supreme,' ready and willing to protect Earth from all those dark dimensions out there (and Mads Mikkelsen!).As I mentioned, the story is pretty much what you'd expect from any of Marvel's recent offerings. However, this one is the first one that really centres on actual 'magic' with its plentiful psychedelic effects which are used for both the battles and trips into other dimensions. A lot of people have commented on how much they look similar to the way the worlds 'fold' in the film 'Inception' and I have to say that it was instantly recognisable. Whether you consider that a drawback or not is up to you. Either way, they are pretty impressive (as you'd probably expect from a big budget Marvel movie) and make a change from the usual beating up of endless CGI robots in New York! If there's one constant criticism that's always levelled at Marvel movies, it's that they have a distinct lack of decent villains. We've had Tom Higgleston's 'Loki' and that's about it. Perhaps that's why they went an employed the extremely talented Mads Mikkelsen as the antagonist here. He, as you'd expect if you've seen him in anything before, he's as good as he can be with what he's given. However, in the grand scheme of things, he's just the guy Dr Strange has to defeat at the end, leaving most of us lamenting the fact that Loki wasn't included (again!).When the casting was announced for Dr Strange, there was some minor controversy regarding using white actors for Asian roles. I guess this is only a problem if you know the source material. I wasn't sure who they were referring to as I hadn't read the comic; instead I just enjoyed the romp and the pretty colours used in the magic scenes! Benedict was good and a welcome addition to the Marvel shared universe. Apparently, his accent was a little off here and there (as my girlfriend said he sounded 'Scottish' at one point!). Overall, Dr Strange isn't anything new, but it is good fun and plenty to build on in the expanded universe."

Bendict Cumberbatch really looked like what I would think Dr. Strange would look like so casting was spot on there. The visuals were pretty good other then some of it looked rehashed and the NYC fight scene looked like a better version of Inception. But the story just had so many holes and stuff that wasn't explained just kind of appeared and became part of the story. And the directors very conspicuous use of non stereotypical people to play some of the parts actually hurt the movie. The man is in Nepal in the capital of Katmandu and he is accosted in a back alley by a boy band? No! really, all the muggers were white or black not an Asian in sight. Why go to Nepal he could have walked down to the sanctum in NYC still got mugged and got brought into the order. And the end....mahhh But I guess you got to have your orgin story.

" Amazing Movie. A Treat For The Eye.
",0.7579,0.9794,2017-03-08 00:00:00,9,One of the best Marvel movies to date. The movie has amazing visual effects that make sure you are wowed at every moment throughout the movie. It beautifully shows the main characters frustration at his life being changed forever. It perfectly shows the change from an arrogant man to someone who realises he was meant for greater things.

" Looked Promising

I was thoroughly engaged in the plot and the characters.Then about half way through, it started to get messy. The story-line felt rushed and scenes overblown.I notice these days if the writing is weak, then film-makers start to blow up things hoping the audience won't notice a predictable story-line.I get that comic geeks love this stuff but at the same time, how often can the same plot-lines be repeated over and over again? In the Lee universe I guess ad nauseam. So no surprise, there is going to be a sequel to pick up from the rather bland ending.Blowing up the world and reassembling it through your green time trinket is not a good enough ending for me. Sorry to be a spoiler but that's how disappointed I felt watching it.If film studios can't raise the budget to hire a stellar writing team, them using the budget on excessive CGI isn't going to make it better.But since comic book fans are loyal followers, the formula works. Question is: what about the rest of us looking for solid story lines within a great fantasy film? Dr. Strange shows we are not part of the equation. Because of this, I give the film a 6. Would have been less but the film started out very strong so that's really what I'm rating. The beginning and not the end."
" Exactly What You'd Expect - Unfortunately
",-0.34,0.9771,2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"Doctor Strange is THE quintessentially generic Marvel comic-book film. It executes the established formula with mechanical precision. The origin. The early training. The villain. The gratuitous quips. The evolution of The Costume. The Earth-shattering finale. It's all there.This makes for a fun film, but not a great one. What Doctor Strange really lacks is *strangeness.* The truly original vision that Steve Ditko brought to comics in the 1960s (and which numerous other creators have built on, over the years). The early plots were hokey, maybe, but they were original. The look and feel and concept of the comics was unusual, bizarre, like nothing that had gone before. It was that unique sense of style that set Doctor Strange comics apart.Doctor Strange, the film, is devoid of any style of its own. As the trailers correctly intimated, the visuals are largely swiped from Inception, and do absolutely nothing to capture the Ditko world of demented alternate dimensions. The look of the film is glossy and modern, where it should be bizarre and scary.The often-annoying Cumberbatch is actually not bad as Stephen Strange - but he's also not particularly good. He's really the same guy as Robert Downey's Tony Stark. Both of whom could easily be older Peter Parkers. He's yet another Generic Action Guy, laughing nervously in the face of cosmic dangers. Even though Doctor Strange was the one Marvel hero who was truly devoid of humor. His was a grim world of sorcery, not of levity, but of endless study and utter devotion to forbidden arts. There's none of that in this film.Doctor Strange is certainly worth seeing as two hours of light diversion. It's well-made and satisfying in its own terms. But coming after a decade of Marvel adaptations, it's also utterly forgettable. And a cosmic let-down to anyone who had any love for the original material. It's probably just about what Steve Ditko would have feared Hollywood would do to his work."

His personality, wit, stubbornness and ambition were portrayed very well on screen. Rachel McAdams also played her role perfectly and I really hope she gets more screen-time in future movies.The story is also a little different from what we've seen in previous Marvel movies and some of the visuals reminded of other great sci-fi films, such as Inception and The Matrix, but Doctor Strange sets itself apart with a wonderful introductory story to the character within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The action sequences were pretty cool but I feel they could have been a lot more intense and breathtaking in a world where the perception of reality are limitless. Visually, it was still nice to look at but the potential to be much more thrilling was definitely there after watching the movie.Overall, this was a fun film to see and I highly recommend it if you've enjoyed Marvel's previous films. I, for one, am excited for more Marvel movies in the future and how they will connect with Doctor Strange."
" Stan Lee: That is hilarious!
",0.4574,0.8707,2017-03-03 00:00:00,5,"Doctor Stephen Strange is by my count now the third rich and arrogant jerk to be run through the Marvel blender and come out the other side a superhero. These stories of redemption are easy suckers because the heroes are merely sitting on the other side of our affections and all it takes is a little goodwill and roughly hewn smirk for audiences to be won over. Robert Downey Jr. played fast and close to his real life persona, and Chris Hemsworth more than looked the rugged part, but also spoke with natural confidence. For all the detractors of the MCU and the criticism it attracts for being formulaic, Doctor Strange knew it would hit a home run by simply retracing the paths of this formula. Anyone who's seen Sherlock already knows how condescending Benedict Cumberbatch can be - it was just a matter of shaping him towards looking out for the greater good. But real pitfalls don't really exist in Doctor Strange. The arc of the arrogant man brought to his knees by unfortunate circumstances and made to defrost and learn a little humility is a crowd pleaser, as the studio's track record has already shown. Yet Strange happens to casually master every spell-bending, kung-fu kicking lesson thrown at him, and by day two he is already sneaking into the library and speedreading all its ancient formulas (he has photographic memory, as you do). You can't simultaneously humble a protagonist but keep prodding him forward as the chosen one, destined to bring balance to the force or protect the Earth or something. Strange keeps reaching for his plotted redemption, attempting to swallow his ego and think about someone other than himself for once, but how can he do that when magical capes of levitation are throwing themselves at him and ancient immortal beings are passing on enormous burdens for his shoulders to carry? There is an abundance of excellent actors here - Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelsen, the painfully under-utilised Michael Stuhlbarg - and barely a solid character between them. Wong is Wong, guardian of the library and a master of the mystic arts, but is quickly relegated to being the straight counterpoint to Strange's comedic quips. Marvel's humour is by now purely fan service, one-liners served on a platter directly to the audience, crafted via scientific method to elicit the most laughs. When someone mentions Beyonce, Drake or wifi passwords, they're addressing the audience through the screen, and the movie's characters treat these moments as required formalities. Yes, Wong silently humming Single Ladies is a nice touch, but why reduce his role in the climax to one reeking of bathos, as if he's become the giggling punchline to a long running joke? Between that and having his corpse being pulled from the rubble via time-reversal, he hasn't been given a single capable moment. Mikkelsen should feel the most maligned of the cast - the screenwriters have resurrected a D-level villain for the purposes of a single film, and him to become the unfortunate victim of Strange's origin story. Kaecilius sports edgy, alien guyliner and monologues morosely of his noble purposes for seeking power from the dark dimension (yep, that's what it's actually called), but the script doesn't bother to throw some flashbacks or even the name of a dead spouse to bolster his motivations. Eventually he's swept aside for the big gas cloud baddie in the finale. Strange's method of attack here is clever, but the scene descends into what is essentially a gag reel. The story builds up to the moment by stressing the need for Strange to finally act selflessly, but the endurance act isn't the eternity of torment that it needs to be. It's supposed to test his newfound resolve, but instead of gritting his teeth as the death beam incinerates him, he's rolling his eyes and mouthing ""not again"" like a Looney Tunes character about to succumb to gravity. After all that, the movie pretends to warn us of the fatal dangers of playing with time but then uses it as a precursor to what will eventually happen - it's an exposition stepping stone, designed so that his mastery of time manipulation doesn't feel too strange. Doctor Strange bursts at the seams trying to squeeze in all its new rules, villains and mystical powers into yet another piece of the Infinity War puzzle. Marvel deserves praise for pulling off something magnificent and unheard of in bringing unwieldy comic material to life, and joining all the strands together. Yet looking closely these movies are only loosely cobbled together by whispers, cameos and the infamous post-credits scenes. One of the most inexplicable moments in Civil War comes when Spiderman and Ant-man suddenly pop out from behind the greenscreen to take their place on opposing sides of the skirmish. All the comic book fans cheered, but what about those of us in the audience that wanted some motivation?"

Benedict cumberbatch said this when asked about him being casted as doctor strange, ""Excited. Really excited. There's a lot of work to be done and i'm just at the beginning of it all so i'm not going to talk too much about it but it's a thrilling gig to get. I just can't wait. Very excited.""

Doctor strange has such a great visual aspect that if you don't like the story at least the visual aspects will blow you away.Doctor Strange is an incredible movie and i recommend it to everyone. Acting 9/10, Benedict Cumberbatch nails the role as Stephen Strange. Visual aesthetics 10/10, this movie sets the bar for the best appearance. Story 8/10, follows the comics but may not please everyone. Doctor strange is a great movie and is a must watch for any comic book fan."

Sadly his powers are nothing to do with neuroscience and everything to do with waving magic hands in the air to get what you need after borrowing Harry Potter's spell book from the library."

Guardians had instantly become my favorite film in the franchise so far & Doctor Strange is now right there along with it! It was visually stunning, I mean the cinematic work here is breathtaking & magical! The fantasy elements to Doctor Strange open up a much needed door into a more paranormal aspects of the Marvel Universe & I hope that we get more stories surrounding Doctor Strange & the magical paranormal world he is a part of!!"

Granted, some things were not very realistic and the character development was much too quick in certain parts but overall this was very well achieved.The movie is reminiscent of Inception and Matrix and I absolutely loved the first scenes, featuring the Ancient One.Cumburbatch played this character wonderfully. He is witty and egocentric and even though there is development to the character he never ceases to be true to himself. Some of the humorous moments are simply hilarious. He seems to have been born for this part, much like Iron Man seems to have been created for Robert Downey Jr.All the other actors performed brilliantly as well, though. Tilda Swinson was simply amazing and her interactions with Cumberbatch were so much fun and awe-striking. Rachel McAdams did great as well; it's not easy to shine in such a roll but she was very good and believable. Mads Mikkelsen as the villain was also superb. I had not expected such a humane approach to him.I had a great time watching Doctor Strange and definitely recommend it."

I recommend watching it in theater or at least on a TV as big as possible. Standard computer monitors or, God forbid, tablets are out of question. Although 90% of this movie is pure action and fighting scenes, compared to most of the genre, story and characterization are more complete and Benedict and Tilda are excellent. Sure, like in all Marvel movies, there is a certain amount of humor and finale is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in Marvel movies. The way Strange finally defeats the enemy is at the same time unbelievably stupid, unbelievably clever and funny to tears.

I didn't feel anything for the characters, they were like puppets dancing in front of me. The only good in all this was the acting of Benedict Cumberbatch (an excellent actor who did a good job with a really bad script - I'll say it again, really BAD script) and the VFX (they were pretty and colorful - who said Transformers from part 2 to 10?).To sum up, although it has a few jokes that will make you laugh. The film was supposed to give you a magical, emotional and exciting experience. And for sure, it magically failed, because you achieve that with deep characters in good scripts, not just with fireworks going out from the actors' fingers."

So basically I had high expectation to witness another side of Marvel universe with another set of (super)heroes. And surprisingly, it was very entertaining, nothing like other Marvel's heroes/story, except the possession of superpower to fight evil forces.Firstly, Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead in a Marvel film, I did not think it would work. All I knew is he was a great sidekick, but that image has changed here. He was wonderful, definitely I'll be looking forward to its sequel as they had confirmed at the end. The theme wise, it is similar to most of the superhero tales, but some new concepts were added to it, I mean the superpower and that's what made it so unique.Just like 'Thor', this film as well had taken the spiritual believes only for the basic platform. The rest of the developments are the clear mix of fantasy (illusion) and science. So it means the film is for theists and atheists. I am one of those who did not like 'Inception', which I think an ordinary action film with multiple layers. But this one was so awesome and it is for the people like me who think 'Inception' failed.Visually spectacular. I regret missing it out in digital 3D. Its Academy Awards nominee in the category of Best VFX tells the story. There will be a tough contest, even I'm up for 'Jungle Book', but I won't be sad if this wins. The success story of Marvel continues. Not everybody reads comic books, but film goers are the majority. So adaptations like this are people like me. Let them keep coming, I love this format better. This film is not just for the youngsters, but old, families, as well as kids can enjoy, so I hope you won't miss it.8/10"

There is no character better suited as a candidate to go on this journey with then Doctor Stephen Strange. He is the master of magic, regardless of which medium the audience/readers find themselves in.Played suavely by Benedict Cumberbatch, a lot of people draw comparisons with Tony Stark. They do share some personality traits, however Stephen Strange set himself apart - at least in the film - by being more reserved in his attitude.Supported by a strong cast who give good - Rachel McAdams (Christine Palmer), Chiwetel Ejiofor (Mordo) & Mads Mikkelsen (Kaecilius) - to great performances, - Tilda Swinton (The Ancient One) - Doctor Strange proves a strong addition to Marvel's shared universe despite it's fairly rushed by the numbers story.

" Doctor Strange: The Marvel Universe on Acid
",0.25,0.9962,2017-02-23 00:00:00,9,"Doctor Strange is a refreshing movie in the marvel cinematic universe, by breaking the stereotypical hero cycle and creating a truly unique hero story. The movie keeps the viewer truly entertained from start to finish with amazing graphics, action set pieces, and stunning plot twists. The truly reinvigorating aspect of this movie is how different this movie than other superhero movies, Marvel studios ditched the guns and explosions and instead to a more mystical approach. While this is a mostly stand- alone movie it definitely builds upon the notions of the fabulously crafted marvel universe with references to the movies that have come before it. Throughout the movie Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is skeptical of the of the world around him as well as his journey and the paths he chooses to overcome not only his paralysis but his ego. After he is unable to operate due to a car accident, Steven desperately turns to a magical sorcerer to help find his meaning in life. Benedict Cumberbatch did a fantastic job of embodying the iconic comic book character Dr. Strange. Although his American accent took time to get used to it did not impede his performance. Benedicts performance allowed the view to feel the sheer pain and struggle as well as triumph that Steven Strange exudes throughout the movie. The makeup and costume design team did a fantastic job at making Benedict have a truly uncanny resemblance to Steven strange in the comics. Tilda Swinton's take on the ancient one was original yet true to the comics, her performance was captivating. The major criticism I have for the movie is the lack of character development of the villains Dormammu and Kaecilius, the movie doesn't explore enough of characters' background to make them truly horrifying. Marvel studios showed off the full potential of their graphics team with truly mind- bending visuals throughout the movie. Dr. Strange has also been nominated for an Oscar in best achievement in visual effects. The visual effects of this movie are best describe as combination of Inception and Rick and Morty. They had a healthy balance of practical and digital effects. The director used the visual effects to continue the story, for instance in one scene Steven is having a vision of hands grabbing drowning him, showing if he continues to worry about what he can't do with his hand paralysis it will be his downfall. The costume and set design was fantastic with many Easter eggs and winks at the comics throughout the movie.If you enjoyed any of the other marvel movies, or are a fan of martial arts movies, this film will thoroughly entertain and captivate you. I would give this movie an 8.5/10, the special/visual effects in this are like nothing you have ever seen on the silver screen before."

The added humour actually improved the movie. Amazing CGI (albeit a little too much at times), excellent cast, great settings...

Losing his eyes for CGI specs, Mads Mikkelsen still finds space to get his teeth into a boo-his performance as Kaecilius,while Tilda Swinton gets into the mystical groove as Strange teacher The Ancient One.Keeping links to the Marvel Universe limited to an end-credits scene,the screenplay by co-writer/(with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill) director Scott Derrickson rolls out a fizzy mix of Martial Arts Action and shiny Comic-Book origin magic.Despite the ending being abrupt and Strange's ex being pushed to the sidelines,the writers make the flaws ones easy to forgive,thanks to Strange's new psychedelic world giving the Comic-Book origins a refreshing spin.Bringing ""magic"" into Marvel flicks,director Derrickson and cinematographer Ben Davis present a spectacular kaleidoscope world,seamlessly looping real locations with overlapping CGI that superbly alters the ""real world"" appearance.Sending Strange round the planet of every universe, Derrickson bravely dips into surrealism,as Strange discovers his powers in a cosmic wave of purple planets and gold/green psychedelic tides,as Strange becomes the strangest Marvel superhero."

Instead, the conceited clinician is introduced to an ancient magic that imbues him with the ability to cast-spells, travel between realms and astral project.Elsewhere, an embittered ex-student (Mads Mikkelsen) gathers the numinous articles needed to summon a dormant evil from the dark dimension and release it on New York.Intriguing enough for amateurs and faithful enough for diehards, this mind-bending adaptation of Marvel's Sorcerer Supreme is a masterpiece.

Doctor Strange was a good idea, however it seems the Marvel Universe seems to have sold out with this latest introduction to the superhero catalog.The CGI action scenes were far from subtle, and very overloading. It reminded me of Michael Bay's Transformers movies. The movie itself was too short to tell the whole backstory of Doctor Strange, and a lot of that character development was lost. The plot itself moved too quickly to really gain the momentum that you wanted to feel for Doctor Strange and his plight, but fell short. Was the studio ACTUALLY trying to make a movie about Doctor Strange? No. Like Suicide Squad, Doctor Strange was a quickly thrown together mish-mash of the Doctor Strange we grew to enjoy in the comics to tie the characters into The Avengers: Infinity War, by pathetically revealing at the end that heart of the amulet Doctor Strange wore was an Infinity Stone.

Seems like a fairly easy, if overdone, template for the next chapter in Marvel's sprawling cinematic universe. Yet, strangely (har har), there's very little character progression and the doctor's personal arc falls thoroughly flat. Following a brief stumble through his rolodex of former colleagues and a very short humbling at the hands of spiritual masters, Strange makes no personal advancement. He merely shifts from being the world's greatest surgeon to its resident sorcerer supreme. No penance, no spiritual enlightening, just a short rocky patch in his perfect life and then a nearly-immediate gratification. Shallow character development among the supporting cast, particularly in Mads Mikkelsen's villainous foil (underdeveloped rivals being a dirty habit in the MCU), doesn't provide the crutch that might have smoothed things over somewhat. The effects work is dazzling and creative, providing much more than we saw in the trailers, but that's really the only draw here.

The sense of humour in it makes it a little bit different and something new. I have not enjoyed a superhero movie in a long time so much that I didn't liked it, but this one I loved watching it. It was an easy going movie and not tiring at all. Like a 20-minute comedy episode. I've noticed that Benedict couldn't shake Sherlock off. If it wouldn't have been for the suit, hair and beard and the costume with an American accent, you'd see Sherlock all over it. Which is not necessarily a bad thing cause I enjoyed it, but if I see it in his next movies enough I might stop following his filmography. The script is the same but is a satirical black comedy making fun of superhero movies and all those great moments that the superhero realizes his power and the music starts, the wind is blowing and his pilgrim is flying.... and then it's ruined (haha). It was a refreshing thing to see the fun side of being a superhero.But if we take it as a serious one then it has gone in a completely different direction. I would have liked it had the movie been darker, but I don't really know if that could have worked.Also the romance is out here, only a light touch (not too much), just enough so the audience can see a soft side of the man with the pressure of the world in his arms. Rachel McAdams, no Notebook for you here. The modern-now-day cultural references to Eminem, Beyonce, Drake and what not show the fun side of the movie and keeping in track with ''present'' time as in other superhero films the character looks like he's not in touch with today and looks like he's a thousand years old. Shows that they're not savages. Overall it is worth it, if you wanna relax and have a drink, take your mind off a hard day's work ... this is a good recommendation. 7/10."

I've spent too many hours watching motion pictures that are not worth anyone's time : I am referring to Iron Man 2 and 3, Thor 2, C. America 2, The Avengers 2, Guardians of the Galaxy. And now Doctor Strange as well.I appeal to the readers memory for a comparison : does anyone remember Iron Man (2008, Jon Favreau)? Was it necessary to ruin every minute of that movie with senseless fights? Did the writers deem it mandatory to accelerate the story ignoring logical passages? Was ""Iron Man""'s only purpose to prepare the ground for an unwanted sequel? Of course not. And what do we have? A complete movie, entertaining and funny, inspiring and meanwhile full of action, and more importantly, an intellectually interesting experience. ""Doctor Strange"" is the opposite of all that. Too many side characters, too much ""noise"" : where's the true story? And the way he confronts the monstrous villain (the only moment the audience could have been actually interested in) : grotesque.The CGI is so evident and ever-present one could almost say it's the only true protagonist of the motion picture. The visual effects are often remarkable, but one wonders if they are always necessary and proportionate to the scenes they are located in.Just like the whole new superheroes saga : did we really need it?"

Well, in a way, the same could be said about Doctor Strange. This film has so many talented and trending actors involved that it could either be absolutely great or... or all that talent and gravitas were simply a distraction from something profoundly failing. Cloud Atlas was an example of the former. This film, alas, is one of the latter.Doctor Strange goes off the hinges from the very beginning, when you see people as serious and dramatic as Mads Mikkelsen and Tilda Swinton go full Last Airbender and start waving hands as if they had a seizure. You might be hoping that it's just an awkward intro and another acclaimed batch made of Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rachel McAdams would do better. Alas, that talent also gets wasted on waving hands and saying pompous nonsense. Well, except for McAdams, who basically remains her typical cute/sensitive/soothing self, thus giving this film one of its scarce redeeming points.However, it's not the characters that cause Doctor Strange to fail. Separately, they are rather amusing, and the talent and charisma the actors still possess bring in a handful of small ironic or witty or indeed dramatic and touching episodes which we could actually enjoy.But when the main story kicks in, it all goes sideways. Because the world of Doctor Strange is not just lacking a strong guideline. It's also ridiculously rehashed, looking like a product of a perverse carnal love of Harry Potter and The Matrix that took place inside Christopher Nolan's mind while he was trying to go deeper by taking another LSD pill and reaching into that fractal trip. It might even sound cool, like who doesn't love HP or The Matrix or Inception. But, albeit intricate and appealing by themselves, together those concepts are as compatible as a fish, a dog and a bird: pulling each in its own direction and ultimately letting the combo go stale. Towards the finale the film gets so dull and generic that you would have to force yourself to keep attention to what's going on.It's obvious that, after several decades of comic books and almost 20 years of screen adaptations, Marvel is in crisis of coming up with new interesting characters to build new stories around, while the old characters gradually wear off. The last Iron Man was a mess, the last Thor was a dark dullfest, and a fresh addition of Ant-man resulted in a complete travesty. The only hero that still pulls his (and his colleagues') weight is Captain America, which is even more surprising considering that he's far from the most popular superhero Marvel owns. The studio still manages to mix its toys in rather interesting ways, making them fight either alongside or against each other. So my only hope for Doctor Strange is that his addition wouldn't ruin that already overcrowded mob scene. Because in Marvel's world there are way too many marvels already."

Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as Doctor Strange himself.3. Mads Mikkelsen does great as Kaecillius, though I believe some work could have been done on his character.4.

The humour that was very was very successful and I laughed audibly multiple times throughout.7. How they deal with the major threat in the movie was spectacular and really shows a break in formula for Marvel.Bad:1. The story wasn't very interesting.2. I really wish the character of Kaecillius could have been more thoroughly explained and flushed out to suit with Mads Mikkelsen's magical acting capability. Acting was good; character was bad.3. I wish there wasn't a love interest for Doctor Strange. It didn't need it and is would have actually been a nice break of formula for Marvel individual character movies.4. The 'twist' involving Mordo at the end was so painfully predictable and I've never touched a Doctor Strange comic in my life. It was stupid and lazy and so obvious.5. Mid-way through, there is an action scene unlike anything I've ever seen. It was phenomenal. It was genius. That being said, it made the final fight of the movie seem anti-climactic. The time travel gimmick was nice, yes. But it just fell short of the legacy the mid-way fight delivered.6. There is so much exposition in the film. I understand it was needed for such a foreign and unique concept such as this, but this was a bit overkill. They needed to set up the world but could have done it much more efficiently.7. His origin was also wasted. I don't want a three hour epic on him being a surgeon but I would have liked more Stephen Strange, not Doctor Strange, to flesh out his character before they got into the meat of the story.8/10"

How apt then that he plays such a character in this film. The difference of course is that in the film his character finds redemption.The story is rather far fetched in that mystical forces are but an effort away as is the end of the world, and is just that bit overly rooted still in the comic book rather than being able to make a successful transition to film. The villains offer little menace due to an inability to relate the film to the real world. A comic book is aimed at children whereas a film needs to appeal to a wider audience and here it struggles. It's just too much of a suspension of reality to drag you in to believing the story. The hero of the piece is fast tracked through his training at a speed that must make all other trainees somewhat miffed adding to the lack of realism that even a fantasy film must anchor itself with.The actors all do a good job, Cumberbatch included, and the effects are top notch but it's the story that lets it all down. It's just brought too much of the comic book to the film and as such it's too simple and at the same time too far fetched. It's not a turkey but it's not even close to getting into my list of films I'll watch more than once."
" One of Marvel's best
",0.6369,0.9741,2017-02-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is fantastic. I truly enjoyed watching it! Unlike most other movies of Marvel franchise, there is a heavy emphasis on character development. This keeps audience glued to the story on a deep cellular level.The movie is littered with spiritual themes which adds further depth to this already amazing story.Those who like movies and TV series of medical genre are in for a treat. As the title suggests the story involves a doctor.I also like how the story blends in and moves forward, in prefect synchronization. Particularly given the complexity of the plot. Quite a tribute to the three screenwriters.Great movie, can't wait for the next one!"
" Just for Benedict Cumberbatch
",0.0,-0.5166,2017-02-13 00:00:00,6,"I am not a fan of Marvel so I can only judge this movie by itself. This three-dimension movie tries to show effects but actually makes itself dizzy. Two many confusing plots fill the whole story, and there is no gradual process for the protagonist to change from a layman to a master - he just finishes the process almost in a second looking at the mysterious book. What's more, in the end, the ending egg is even more ridiculous: Baron Mordo was loyal to the earth while he turned his back on it just after saving the earth without reasonable transition. Although I didn't read the comics, I can sense that the story would be much better and more integrated in the comics."
" Visually stunning, but lacking in story
",0.2023,0.9694,2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"FINALLY a movie worthy of 3D. This has been such a gimmick to me in other movies. This one takes full advantage and it really adds to the experience. The visuals are truly impressive. The story itself could have been better, though. I didn't feel connected to very many of the characters. With this not being a mainstream Marvel character, I was hoping to learn more about this world. Tilda Swinton seemed bored at times. I think she was going for stoic, but it didn't always read that way. Too many of the jokes fell flat and they came off like jokes rather than feeling natural if that makes sense. An entertaining movie overall, however."
" Complete horse poop
",0.0,-0.9888,2017-02-12 00:00:00,2,"Sorry but I just don't see it. The only thing going for this movie is special effects and that is all. You might as well call this Transformers XII or whatever number they are on. The story was asinine and pretty much nullifies the need for any other heroes and the characters themselves were total garbage. Strange is un-redeemable. He is filth and not smart in any way. Again, Hollywood does not seem to be able to portray what smart people are really like. They think that we are all air heads. We might be arrogant and many think we might seem condescending to some but we are usually right and we almost never as closed minded as this clown. In fact, by definition of being smart, we better understand just how little we know. We don't need to be reminded of this and we are fully aware of it. This portrayal of smart scientist in this movie is insulting.Next, the antagonist was also a total flipping retard. The plot is that he wants to live forever by killing everyone and sacrificing the earth to something that does not live under the rule of time... well if the thing is outside of time, why the hell does it seem to exist at a specific point? Why does it not exist across multiple points as it should and why would a time loop isolate it to one form? Why did it not just leave Strange alone and continue what it was doing prior? It didn't actually need to kill him but it was apparently so dumb that it couldn't think of any other solution to escape the trap.I don't know. It was one of the worst Marvel movies I have seen. Certainly worse than Wolverine and old Hulk movies."

The casting was decent; I almost always like Mikkelsen, Cumberbatch, et al. The visuals-which I'm generally unimpressed by since almost anything can be done to a degree-were fantastic: psychedelic, dazzling, pretty. The story was OK, but I found the action itself played out mostly like another kung fu movie with a huge budget. I guess there's a challenge in providing an entertaining enough movie about sorcerers battling, but the battle sequences were sorta boring. Over all it was an entertaining watch, and I'm interested to see Strange shoehorned into the crowded movie Marvel universe."
" A deeper Marvel story...who knew.

As he makes his escape, the architect, I mean, a bald monk arrives and start flipping space horizontally and vertically, still, Hannibal escapes through some wormhole.Then we meet Dr. Strange a brilliant and supremely arrogant neurosurgeon who thinks he's brighter than he really is. While recklessly driving his Lambo he crashes and barely survives. His hands are trashed. A therapist tells him the story of a guy who was paralyzed but now is walking. The Dr. finds him and this guy tells him about Nanda Parbat, I mean, Kamar-Taj where he can undergo spiritual and physical healing.The Dr. travels to Nepal and starts asking about the place. He's trailed by some monk who eventually takes him there and right away introduces him to the Ancient One, a laughably miscast Tilda Swinton, who was the bald monk from the intro. The other monk, Mordo, is all for supporting the Dr. while Baldy realizes that his massive ego is in the way. She gives the Dr. some Eastern metaphysics lessons to no avail. When he's left no choice but to surrender, he finally develops the power to control energy. She also tells him about the order of things, namely, there are multiverses most of which are under the control of Parallax, I mean, Dormammu. Our multiverse is the last free one so there are temples in NY, London, and Honk Kong to protect the planet. And that is where Hannibal is heading.The pages Hannibal took give him the power to control time. The brilliant Dr. learns everything he can from the ashram's library, including things he shouldn't and with the eye of so-and-so he too controls time and envisions the missing pages. He also learns something interesting about Baldy. At one of the temples, a floating cape attaches to him and he he fights with Hannibal and his minions. Now a fully empowered Dr. and Mordo and the librarian head to the last temple where Dormammu is about to swallow the universe.Why has it taken so long for the Marvel/Disney mafia to release this story instead of cranking out the other ridiculous dressed-up goof movies by the dozen who knows. According to Baldy while the avengers fight in the physical plane, these monks fight in the astral plane, which is of course baloney because here too the fights are physical. The confrontation between Dr. and the colorful kaleidoscope of Dormammu is a bit more cerebral. At least this movie goes a bit deeper with the Eastern thinking. The problem is, it also tries to be irreverent. In fact, this movie doesn't know when to get serious and when to go for laughs. The backstory of the Dr. is also interesting. Competent professionals always make for good characters. Also strong is the philosophy of time, mixed with a bit of ethics. It seems to be getting fashionable as it also was the theme of Arrival. There's a bit of an ethical twist which is very good. The bad guys here do have the stronger argument. But the movie for no good reason flip-flops on the issue.I'm going to give this movie a higher score than it deserves mainly for exposing moviegoers to some deeper thoughts even if it does it tongue-in-cheek unfortunately."
" Enjoyable except poor direction.
",-0.0516,-0.9469,2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"A good chunk of positive elements, especially visual. The twisting landscapes were new and exciting (even though were done in Inception). Especially the chase in the middle, which was balanced and flowed well, despite a demanding visual requirement.The performances were not really demanding but were well served by a slew of very good actors.Writing was a bit better than the regular Marvel fare (Captain America the exception). The metaphysical element were simply defined and accessible, by and large. It was a bit complicated at times but I assumed the benefit of the doubt. I don't think the time loop at the end worked very well. Clunkly.Was disappointed with Scott Derrickson's direction. Thought several instances of detail and artistry were missed. Despite the chases being very good, the actual fight scenes were quite poor. American cinema, and especially Marvel movies, have a habit of making the combat vague and confusing with a shaky camera. This was the case here, plus 20%.Additionally, disappointed with the lack of conflict with the first half, despite the fact that it was heavy with conflict in the 2nd. Somewhat called for a slow start but still felt antsy, even though it did have the pending threat of Mads Mikkelsen's bad guy at the front.In the end, Strange's arc was convincing and effective. Didn't care for Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn to a bad guy at the end. Too much by-the-numbers and sudden."
" visually mind-blowing
",0.0,0.9849,2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"In terms of the quality of the film as a whole, I would give Doctor Strange a 7, but because of its visual effects and implications for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I am totally giving it an 8. Let me explain.Watching this in theaters with the sometimes too-loud sound, seeing the buildings and streets give way and rotate and otherwise bend themselves completely to a person's whim, immediately made me think of Inception. But this was even more hectic. This wasn't imaginary, this was real.Another thing. Finally in the MCU we have some sorcery, direct utilization of magical energy for combat. Discussion of other dimensions; even traveling between them at will. Doctor Strange's final outfit is just wicked cool. If you know the character from the Marvel comics, then you'll know that he's pretty damn powerful. Unfortunately this is an origins film, that is, it reveals how Doctor Strange became Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme; the real deal will come in the third Avengers film hopefully.As a follower of the MCU who's seen basically all of the released films to date, I was eagerly awaiting this one, and I was not dissatisfied. The music was riveting as usual per a Marvel film (Giacchino), the fight sequences intense, the otherworldly conflicts enormous. I'm so glad this guy's joining the Avengers in their imminent battle with Thanos, or at least I'm pretty sure he is. Now all that being said, Doctor Strange wouldn't fall in my top 5 MCU films; Captain America, Avengers 2, for example were much better, but it's part of the MCU, and therefore is a must-see for any MCU fan.I also noticed a lot more wit and almost off-character humor in this film than in other MCU films. And of course, as all the MCU films are taking place chronologically within the same universe (or multiverse?), there are several references to the bigger pictures, i.e. the Avengers."

The supporting cast is decent especially McAdams as the love interest and Tilda Swindon controversially cast as The Ancient One.

Another starring role is filled by Tilda Swanton as The Ancient One. Not too much of a sappy love story (although it is included). Interesting locations, from London to New York, and Hong Kong to Kathmandu. Marvel has continued their high standard of fantasy / super hero movies.All in all: original story line, great acting, amazing special effects - a winner!

After strange arrival to Nepal, he seeks Kamar-Taj. The Ancient One shows Strange her power, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. Amazed, Strange begs her to teach him, and she eventually agrees. Strange begins his tutelage under the Ancient One and Mordo, and learns from the ancient books in the library. Strange learns that Earth is protected from other dimensions by a spell formed from three buildings called Sanctums, found in New York City, London, and Hong Kong. The task of the sorcerers is to protect the Sanctums. Strange become sorcerer over several months, even secretly reading from the text Kaecilius stole from and learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, comparing his arrogant yearning for power to that of Kaecilius, who believes, after the deaths of his loved ones, that everyone should have eternal life.Kaecilius and his followers use the stolen pages to begin summoning the powerful Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist and all can live forever. This destroys the London Sanctum, and sends Strange from Kamar-Taj to the New York Sanctum. From the attract, strange got Cloak of Levitation. Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that her long life has come from her own use of Dormammu's power. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One, and escapes to Hong Kong. The ancient one then dies, despite the best efforts of Strange. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead and the Sanctum destroyed, with the Dark Dimension already engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to turn back time and save Wong, before creating an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment forever. After killing Strange many times to no avail, Dormammu reluctantly agrees to leave Earth if Strange undoes the time loop, taking Kaecilius and the zealots with him.Strange returns the Eye, which Wong calls an Infinity Stone, to Kamar-Taj, and then takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies. In a mid-credits scene, the Strange decides to help Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to Earth to search for their father Odin. In a post-credits scene, Mordo confronts Pangborn and takes the energy he uses to walk, stating that Earth has ""too many sorcerers""."
" Too short on script, too long on CGI

I'm of the latter persuasion.I'm a major, major fan of Cumberbatch. Tilda Swinton is compelling and you just can't go wrong with Rachel MacAdams so the acting is beyond excellent.I'm a major Doctor Strange fan, too, and there's always the worry that a movie of the comic will fall over (witness the first Judge Dredd movie). It's never going to be easy and this, I think, does a pretty food job. However, it's really not quite good enough.Why? Well, some events don't hang together very well, some didn't seem to make sense and the whole movie is completely overshadowed by the CGI. They're good, oh yes, but unnecessary for a lot of the movie. They're often so fast that you can't clearly make out what's happening and they're ultimately distracting.A little more money - and time - spent on the screenplay and less on the special FX could have made this a stupendous movie rather than just OK.However, for those who are blown away by special FX, yes this will blow you away.Having said all that, it IS worth watching although if you're not into superhero movies I doubt you'll manage to stay awake. Serious Doctor Strange fans may well be disappointed. But do watch it on the big screen or the FX will be totally lost."

",0.4939,0.9736,2017-02-03 00:00:00,7,"At this stage in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the standalone movies have become pretty predictable. The sheer frequency of these films and the existing knowledge that they're not going to kill any of the characters off because they need them for ensemble films is common at this point, so there are no major stakes.Also, after thirteen films in the MCU where they have more or less fleshed out the majority of these superheroes, suddenly now we're being introduced to a fresh face? Just a tad jarring. The introduction to Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange is nothing we aren't used to. Typical fall from grace and redemption story.The cast are all respected thespians in their own right, but there are no Oscar worthy scenes here. Well, in terms of acting, anyway. The CGI, absolutely. The visuals in this film are so trippy and well done that it deserves its Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects. It certainly took a few leaves out of 'Inception's book and the result is truly mesmerizing.Otherwise, it's just a pretty standard addition to the backlog of Marvel films. The villain isn't that impressive, the threat is easily stopped and it's pointless to get invested in emotional stakes."

It was thoroughly entertaining if a little jumbled.Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One was a controversial choice to many, but honestly I could not give a damn... Yes, it is an Asian character in the comics, but Hollywood KNOWS that it needs big names to sell seats - And her acting was fantastic!The Story, while not the greatest had some fine action scenes and though it borrowed a little too heavily from Inception - It all worked!And it is damn humorous as well... Some great Funny Moments...So why only a 7 if I enjoyed it so much? Well, yeah there are bad points - To Quote Rossatron, a popular YouTuber and Movie Making Critic, The 'Geography in the fight scenes gets a little convoluted and can be quite hard to follow at times. The fight scenes are all epic but it can be difficult following the various characters.And there must have been some kind of 'Behind the Scenes' discussion... As they made a TERRIBLE CHOICE asking Cumberbatch to try and do an American accent!!! OH BOY IT IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH SOME OF THE WORST ACCENTS IN MOVIES EVER!!!Only slightly behind Sean Connery trying to do Irish in The Untouchables...Benedict tries really hard to maintain the American Drawl, but it sounds so fake... and far too often he ends up reverting to British!I know that in the comics Strange is an American Doctor, but GOD DAMN IT its an Adaption!!!! Play to the strengths of your leads!!! Would it have been that hard to believe that Strange was a British Doctor who had migrated to the US for better opportunities to test his skills? NO! It wouldn't... And it would have saved us from the TERRIBLE Accent that Cumberbatch delivered!And its the accent that makes the film unintentionally hilarious too often... It slips in and out so much you wonder if Strange has a Split Personality!No, It has to be said - Its an enjoyable movie... Not perfect but to launch Doctor Strange into the Marvel Universe, it works!Now lets just hope they do NOT ask Cumberbatch to try and be American again and try and get a little more focus behind the action next time instead of relying on the effects to sell the film.Far better than I actually thought it was going to be...

" An overrated, generic marvel movie
",0.4215,0.7349,2017-01-31 00:00:00,2,"Doctor Strange is the latest installment in the marvel cinematic universe franchise and it is directed by Scott Derrickson (sinister, deliver us from evil). The story follows Stephen Strange, the top neurosurgeon who loses the ability to use his hands after a car accident and his quest for spiritual healing from the help of mystic arts. Much like most marvel movies, the plot of the film is thin and doesn't have much to tell. It follows the simplest form of film making without taking any creative risks or new ideas. The moving point starts at the tenth minute of the movie, the car accident. This is incredibly rushed because barely anything is known about the main character except that he is egotistical and a great doctor. The films gives no detailed insight about his humanity or how he interacts with the real world or how his life is. Nothing of that is given in the film, which weakens it. How is the audience supposed to emphasize with a character that was poorly built from the get go? And it doesn't stop here, the character is basically Tony Stark 2.0 but instead of the armor, he uses magic. Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best to breathe life in Stephen Strange, but the performance falls flat due to the weak script. The only charisma he has are the quips and jokes, which become tiresome really fast. The lack of any dramatic tension or internal conflict makes the character barely 3 dimensional. Stephen does change by the end of the movie, but it feels unearned. This film could have been a unique entry in the superhero genre due to its subject matter: a pure fantasy world filled with magic and other bizarre worlds. But, much like Thor (2011), all of this creativity is overthrown for the sake of decently conceptualized visuals and a generic story that offers no new perspective. The villain in the movie, while not as terrible as the mandarin or other bad mcu villains, is not great either. A mediocre villain with your typical, generic motivations. The film implies a conflicted past between Kaecilius and the Ancient One, but it is not explored. Just as the rest of mcu movies, Doctor Strange has no memorable musical score, and it barely even services the movie well. It doesn't add any form of weight or emotional levity. It is extremely superficial and used only as a tool to make the scenes less awkward or make it funny. Marvel is abusing the solo movies as well as the directors and audiences by giving movies whose sole purpose is to build up to future franchises. The one thing that was truly good was the visuals, which was not mind blowing as people say. Overall, not a terrible movie, but not a good one either."
" Doctor Strange (2016)
",-0.2023,0.9949,2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"Its no secret that Marvel is a money making machine. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has grossed billions of dollars and remains a force every year. Overall, I think the franchise has been very successful in bringing comic book heroes to life through origin stories and combining the heroes for action epics. Marvel's latest installment was introducing the masses to Doctor Strange. I wasn't very familiar with the character so I was cautiously optimistic going into this one.The films stars Benedict Cumberbatch in the titular role. Benedict is a great performer and I think he's always remarkable in what he is in. Doctor Strange is about a arrogant but precisely successful neurosurgeon who gets in a life changing car crash that messes up hi hands. Strange searches far and wide for a way to get his hands working again. he travels to Nepal and is introduced to a fantastically magical world of sorcery where he can do more with his mind and alter reality, time, and the world from harnessing the power within.First off, the effects in this film are great. Its immensely psychedelic and extremely graphically busy. The skyline is constantly shifting and worlds are bending and all of it looks up to par. It was reminiscent of some of the sequences seen in Inception. The fight scenes in the film also do not disappoint. Its got what it needs to keep thrill seekers engaged. Marvel also gathers a very talented cast to add to its never ending list of A-listers involved in the MCU. Mads Mikkelsen is a brilliant performer, although he's a bit of a shallow villain in this.The film has too much going on in concepts. A person's soul? can come out of their body, there is a giant demon thing that's trying to destroy the world, there are shortcuts that lead to major cities, buildings can be moved, there is a mirror reality, a moving cape, fireballs, time can be put on a loop¬Ö its insane how many things happen in this film. Its not that its hard to follow, its just that the film becomes conceptually ugly the longer it goes. It doesn't feel like other Marvel films as the world that is created isn't very interesting and feels bland despite all the visuals involved.Cumberbatch plays a great Doctor Strange. He's an egotistical guy who becomes humbled and is yet witty and remains flawed. He's a welcome addition to the Marvel Universe, I assume he will be a part of the next Avengers film. Its just that this origin film doesn't really stand out as you are just thrown into the world of sorcery and just have to accept what is going on. Its an admirable effort but pales in comparison to some of the other heroes in the MCU. There is still room for improvement and I'm curious to see where this goes.6.5/10"

I'm not sure this film managed to develop his full potential (both as actor and as character). Maybe there was not enough time for this.However enough with this, speaking of time... I lost the time perspective of the story. W/o telling more about what has happened in the film - I'd like simply to say - I have no bloody idea how long he was mastering his skills. At some point he just... became really good. My understanding is it happened rather quickly. Targeting the 17 or lower age they made a huge focus on the potentially attractive 3D scenes (fights, chasing and city-building concept type the Matrix...). In a nutshell - not bad to kill time, but nothing special and definitely below my expectations."

Basically MC Escher and his hyperbolic geometry in play. Beautifully done, but too short.The casting choices are surprisingly close to perfect. Tilda Swinton delivers exquisite performance. Some like to say whitewashed, but the reality is there are white Asians. The important thing is she did a great job. Mads Mikkelsen as the villain is a good choice, but the makeup and fashion downplayed the character. As for Cumberbatch, the guy has the perfect image of Dr Strange, except I really missed his British accent, even though his American accent is very convincing.This looks like first of a sequel. Hopefully the next one is as good."
" Marvel finally made a good comic book movie
",0.6908,0.9935,2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Marvel movies like the movies of its parent company Disney are the literal definition of mediocre and overrated. Through out the decade long tenure of the Marvel cinematic universe and over 10 big budget releases I can say with certainty that no one of the movies released stood out as an actually good comic book movie. Maybe an exciting action flick but not a good comic book movie and this is where even Fox surpasses Marvel let alone Sony with Spiderman films or Warner with its DC titles. Iron man didn't cut it and Avengers with its Chitauri invasion plot certainly didn't either. The reason for that is two things cinematography of Marvel movies which is uninspiring to say the least and Marvel's usual lack of interest or ability in preservation of its source material when transferred over to the big screen. Take Civil War into consideration a movie I watched again recently just prior to watching Doctor Strange and still ended it with being confused by the sheer idiocy of it. Marvel has been doing some really unappreciated things with its source material since the first day and when you want to bring in the comic book fans, the people that have made mcu actually possible you just should not treat these materials so badly. This is why the general consensus among the hardcore comic book community about mcu is mediocrity. In fact the only other movie of the mcu to come close is Guardiana of Galaxy and won't you know it it was a movie loved by both the average movie goer and the hardcore comic book fan. So lets see what Doctor Strange did right. Doctor Strange kept it very real and close to the original material, it didn't mess around with important characters and plot points too much and kept it on point and interesting. There was no line or no shot wasted every thing had a point and delivered on its promise of leading to something else. The visual effects of the movie was just amazing, the cinematography of this movie was very well done and it was very good for a comic book movie. it was breathtaking to watch and if it wasn't for that explosion a few years back called inception it would have been really really ground breaking, alas. The choice of Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange was perfect, he is a Supreme actor playing the part of sorcerer Supreme. The changes made to the Ancient One although unfortunate did not affect the character on a fundamental level and is possible to be ignored. The sound effects are sharp and good but the soundtrack vague and bland. The movie also includes the signature humor of mcu yet again while here unlike Avengers 2 or many other Marvel movies it does fit the situation and this actor,even though origin story of Strange is very dark and serious. Talking about origin story there were indeed some plot points missing in the movie like the first encounter of Strange and the people ofnthe ancient one or the monsters attacking earth etc but thid movie managed to savor as much as possible and very good at that too. It was very refreshing to watch a mcu film that didn't dumb down its plot to hide bad writing. Maybe it has a lot to do with the fact that this movie was much more visual heavy than dialog heavy but whatever it was I know I want more of thid. I can only hope that Black Panther movie follows something similar."
" Exceptional MCU Film
",0.0,0.9919,2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"This is one of my favorite Marvel movies so far, if not my favorite. Exceptionally well acted and incredibly well thought out, this film transcends the superhero movie concept. The action is taut, the digital effects are spectacular, and it's simply one of those films that makes you wish it didn't have to end. Thankfully, there's two ending credit scenes. Benedict Cumberbatch, as far as I'm concerned, was the absolute best choice for the role of Dr. Strange. His top notch acting ability is really what made this movie great. The supporting cast is better than average. It was very well cast. I feel like I can't - really shouldn't - write any more on this review. It shouldn't be dissected, it should just be enjoyed."
" Speed-learning by Dr. Strange
",-0.2023,0.9554,2017-01-25 00:00:00,6,"Okayish Marvel output (it seems to me that by the amount of all the superhero flicks produced and published half of Hollywood must be only working for Marvel or DC productions past years ;) Anyway, what you get is the cgi/graphics of Inception and Matrix (this feature is imo really top-notch and the best part of the movie) combined with some pseudo-esoterically blabla and the typical superhero story of a fight between good and evil. Ofc there are some harsh plot-failures like our Dr. Strange mastering the craft of magick or superhero-powers or whatever within some weeks or months of training and beating the masters of the craft... If the work would be so easy I guess we would get zillions of Bruce Lees or Buddhas walking around ;) Well, no matter how talented you are, I guess nobody really thinks that after one year of some martial arts-training he will got a chance to beat a master of the respective or any martial art. The acting is good - actors like Rachel McAdams, Mikkelsen and Cumberbatch can't play bad. Dr. Strange is pop-corn cinema, good enough for a watch, but Ant-Man and Deadpool are still by far the best recent superhero flicks, ofc just my opinion. Next."
" Dr. Strange.....More Like Dr. Amazing.
",0.743,0.9972,2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"The next franchise in the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes with mystical and magical powers in 'Doctor Strange', which is a damn good start to this new character. 'Doctor Strange' was created by Steve Ditko and first appeared in Strange Tales #110 back in 1963. 'Doctor Strange' or Stephen Strange is a highly intelligent surgeon who is in the top of his field. In an accident, he loses the use of his hands, which leads him to seek out alternate methods of healing. This brings him to a mystical and magical place across the globe where he meets 'The Ancient One' amongst other sorcerers that help him heal spiritually and physically.Whatever Strange had learned or knew before this, is out the window, as he learns of other worlds, universes, and powers beyond imagination. Soon enough, Strange has to help defend Earth, much like 'The Avengers' do, but on a different scale. While 'The Avengers' keep us safe from big monstrous physical threats on Earth, 'Doctor Strange' protects us from magical and mystical threats from other worlds ‚Äì which in due time, we will see everyone come together and team up to fight some evil forces. At least I hope. Filmmaker Scott Derrickson was chosen to direct 'Doctor Strange', which seems like a ""strange"" (all the pun intended) decision given his resume, which includes mostly horror movies ‚Äì 'Deliver Us From Evil' and 'Sinister' to name a few, but it turned out to be a great decision along with his writing partner C. Robert Cargill, who was formally a film critic from AintItCoolNews, who co-wrote this film.The result is simply fantastic and a great start to the 'Doctor Strange' universe. Derrickson and Cargill have done a swell job in conjuring up a great origin story and executing each character's development here. From showing what kind of man Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) was to his transformation to the superhero we see later on ‚Äì it all works. Cumberbatch is excellent too here, hitting all of the right emotional notes as well as performing the physical aspects of the role nicely. The script has a slow burn approach to it in the first half of the film, but is sprinkled with excellent comic bits and action sequences. This slower approach is necessary to really connect and feel for Strange and it works out perfectly, as if you went on this powerful journey together.The only gripe I have, and mind you, it's a small one, is the relationship between Strange and Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), which feels rushed and tiresome, as it's been done before. Perhaps, there just wasn't enough time to really dig deep into it. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo was excellent and almost had a 'Serenity' quality to him, but was a very conflicted character, and he performed that very well. Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius was also fun to watch, but not the best villain w've seen. His makeup looked great and he did a great job, but there needed to be something more from him. Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One was perfect for her role and Benedict Wong as Wong stole every scene he was in.The visual effects were out of this world as some of the bigger action sequences had things I've never seen before in a movie. It was done on such a grand scale too that I was entranced in everything going on through the film. Now I'm not a fan of 3D, but if you have the option, see 'Doctor Strange' in 3D. The visuals are insanely good and it was indeed filmed with 3D IMAX cameras, and not converted like most movies are these days. It simply looks phenomenal. I can't wait for more 'Doctor Strange'.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" A More Though-Provoking Marvel Movie
",0.4728,0.9556,2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Dr. Strange is another Marvel classic-with its fun and extremely well choreographed fight scenes, hints of comedy to even out the serious subject matter, and complex, interesting characters. Benedict Cumberbatch seems like he was born to play the Role of Dr. Strange, and will definitely live up to any expectations you may have. The only complaint I have about the movie is the somewhat excessive use of CGI in several scenes. In most Marvel movies, the CGI is used only when necessary, and it's clear that the actors are used in as many scenes as possible, whereas in Dr. Strange, the CGI could be distracting, and made it a bit difficult to suspend disbelief in some of the scenes. Other than this small issue, Dr. Strange was still just as fun and exciting as other superhero movies that recently came out, but also had more thought-provoking and interesting themes throughout. Overall, Dr. Strange was a fun and interesting film that you're sure to enjoy-just try not to get too distracted by the CGI."
" A strange kind of Marvel.
",0.25,0.9842,2017-01-21 00:00:00,5,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.A Marvel movie that starts out in the normal world of a world class surgeon with a world class narcissism syndrome. When being a victim of a terrible accident, saying to the surgeon who tells him that they did all they could: ""I could have done better.""Somewhere in the out rolling of ""Doctor Strange"" the movie ""Inception"" comes into mind more than three times. Is that good or bad? You decide.To the recommendation part. If you really like Marvel and ""super hero"" movies with lots and lots of special effects, look this one up. Then it is probably deserved a high ranking, as for an 8 or so. If you are looking for another type of movie, for your own good, turn around and face another motion picture. For you, this one is probably worth only 4-5. Doctor Strange starts out as an interesting way displaying an Marvel story. As the story comes out loud, it fades away into infinity of devastation's, bombs, explosions, superheroes... you get the point.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Special effects. A doctor. And strangely enough more effects. - The actors : Enough. Enough for this type of movie. Benedict Cumberbatch faces his challenge in a good way. - Entertainment : As said before; yes and no. - Age : 154,8 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)"
" Entertaintment with capitals
",0.0,0.9926,2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"I'm not into superheroes comics or movies at all. I haven't read the Dr Strange comic ever either. I watched the trailer of this film at the cinema and I thought it looked too cool to let it pass. Besides the caliber of some of the actors involved in the project was a great sign that his wouldn't be yet another Marvel movie with more visuals than substance. Gladly, my hunch was good.Not having read the comic, I cannot comment on whether the adaptation to the screen is good or not. Thus, this review is just about the movie. Doctor Strange is utterly entertaining and has the right mix of drama, adventure, humour, philosophical teaching, character exploration, wow effects, goodies and baddies.The visuals of the movie are spectacular, and they are at the service of the story, not just to wow us with fluff. The styling, coloring, wardrobe, and city landscaping are awesome.To me the philosophical spiritual exploration of the main character is perhaps the thing that enjoyed the most, watching a prick transform from selfishness and narcissism into a person with a mission that transcends himself and puts himself at the service of others and of a greater cause, and that is done through inner hard-work catharsis. I found the British wit displayed in the film great!All the actors are believable in their respective roles. I especially liked Mikkelsen, Swinton, Cumberbatch, and Benedict Wong in this order. However, all the cast does a great job and are believable in their respective roles.Please stay for the full credits, until the very end, because there are two extras there that you don't want to miss.Entertainment as it should be."
" Unfulfilling for the most part
",0.0,0.9597,2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Doctor Strange is a textbook definition of a Marvel film. A generic story, good action sequences, a healthy dose of comedy, and an underwhelming portrayal of an amazing superhero. One thing that sets this film apart for all of its Marvel predecessors is its superb psychedelic visuals. Dr. Strange's introduction to the world of ""magic"" by the Ancient One was some of the most visually appeasing sequences I have seen in film, which is also why I regret not witnessing it in 3-D. Besides the visuals and smart casting of Benedict Cumberbatch for the role of Dr. Strange, this film is very unfulfilling. I was hoping for this film to break the mold and delve away from the formulaic nature of Marvel films, similar to what Deadpool did, but that simply just doesn't happen in this one. It's a great film to watch on a rainy afternoon or during your staycation.Ali's Rating: B-"
" Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews
",0.6988,0.9903,2017-01-08 00:00:00,3,"I have just accepted the death of actual good movies. When I say good, I am talking about good plot, good effects, good acting. Today we get movies that are usually missing one, two, or all three qualities. Dr.Strange the movie has good effects, but the plot, the acting are atrocious. The preview of this movie made this movie like it was going to be awesome. The reviews on IMDb made it seem like this was a good movie. I am so glad, so glad that I did not waste my hard earned cash on going to the theater to see this. I was actually going to see the 3D version. So glad I did not.I accept that the movie makers today make movies to today's foolish, no common sense, no critical thinking, just want to be fed mindless, thoughtless, movies with lots of explosions, loud side effects. The loud sound and other effects is just used to distract the actual thinking movie goer and trick those with a brain to think it is actually a good movie. Dr. Strange tries to trick you into thinking it is a good movie, it fails. It's really hard to put into words. First off, the cartoon version was WAY better. The cartoon version really showed Dr.strange's struggle, he had to trek through the mountains to get to the hidden temple. In the movie he just walks up to a building in the city. The pacing is terrible. The jokes were terrible and took away any seriousness of the plot. So the student who turned to the dark side wants to end the world, who cares. The screen writing/story line makes you not care.At the end of the movie it just felt 'hoky'. I kept thinking of the movie Inception, that is not a good thing. These days finding a good movie is like finding the 'holy grail'."
" Larger than Life
",0.0,0.9434,2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Scott Derrickson made Doctor Strange a visual masterpiece! Art and visual effects surrounding the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's character were stunning. Chiwetel Ejiofor delivered a dramatic crescendo during this exploration of metaphysical and physical conflicts. Benedict responded with conviction, mastery, and swagger. Jon Spaihts, Scott Derrickson, and Robert Cargill interwove humor, spiritualism, and action into the smart dialogues. Tilda Swinton brilliantly delivered against Mads Mikkelsen's character. Rachel McAdams' character was more of the classic contemporary female role. Vicotria Alonso's production team, Ben Davis, and Sabrina Plisco's editing team stitched together this multi-faceted jewel spectacularly."
" Loved this film! May contain Spoilers
",0.636,0.5306,2017-01-06 00:00:00,9,"Knowing nothing from the comic books this is a great film and origin story. Dr. Steven Strange plays a Tony Stark sort of character but a little more of an asshole. The first 10 minutes of the film before the accident he's full of himself and has it all. After the accident, he loses it all and goes on the journey to grow and learns many things from the Ancient One played by Tilda Swinton. The Character Development is great, the fighting/magic battles are great and the reality-bending is Amazing! Some flaws in the film (in my opinion) are from the villain and main villain. So Kaecilius played by Mads Mikkelsen was a former student taught by the Ancient one and he went ""rogue"" and learned the dark magic. In the film, he seems to be the main threat which he sort of is until the ending where we see this ""Thing"" BEING come to destroy earth but DR. Strange saves the day using the time gem to do a constant loop of time until the enemy gives in to Strange's demands. So the villains to me weren't great. Another flaw I find is with Racheal McAdams character. I was hoping for a bigger role for her instead of a ""love interest"". Other than that the film is Amazing. This was one of my favorites of 2016. #RIPAncientOne"
" Doesn't quite reach that Marvel brilliance
",0.7699,0.9948,2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"The fourteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the one where they most unambiguously try to bring magic into their existing universe. In this movie Benedict Cumberbatch plays Dr. Stephen Strange, a renowned neurosurgeon who must set out on a journey after a car crash ruins his hands. This will eventually end up with him discovering the existence of the mystic arts, or magic if you prefer.The movie contains pretty much everything we've come to expect from Marvel films. Absolutely, phenomenally gorgeous visuals, which in this particular case are especially noteworthy, because they take the reality bending aspect of magic and really play with it. Think Inception, only even more kaleidoscopic. Granted, sometimes the visuals are a tad busy, but most of the time they're simply gorgeous.We also get great actors, good humour and a villain that could have been better. Exactly what most of the Marvel movies have been all about. But in this case I found myself noticing the story formula a bit too much. It felt like the movie was simply going through motions, giving us the old, trusted, tested and patented Marvel story. I felt myself missing something new, something exciting, a twist on the old pattern. But it never came.The second big problem I have with the movie is that the magic is actually pretty boring. What I mean by that, is that it makes sense that Stephen Strange only has a few tricks and spells in his repertoire. He's only starting out. But the villain, one of the most powerful magic users on Earth, uses the exact same tricks, with very little variation. Sure there's the dark power he's drawing, and some of the magic users have different magical artefacts, but it still felt stale, unimaginative. Elemental attacks, summoning creatures, mind control, invisibility, transmuting the terrain to your advantage, the list goes on. None of this is seen in the film. It's just blasting coloured lights and teleporting most of the time. Allows for some good kung fu fighting, certainly, but does not come close to being what it should be.That being said, the ending is a huge exception to the issue above. It's creative, set up well in advance, makes sense for Strange's character and is simply entertaining as well as visually interesting.All in all, for me Doctor Strange falls on the lower end of the scale when it comes to MCU movies. It is certainly a good film in its own right, but doesn't quite match the splendour of its predecessors."
" Forget the actors! although all of them did great.
",0.5411,0.9977,2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Everyone bases the movie about the actors, I am sorry but the actors do not make the movie! there are a series of Directors and producers and a well-oiled machine that makes a movie successful, I should know I am an actor but your not going to find my name on here. Let me start by saying that this movie was never meant to be seen without in being in 3D, If you watch this movie in plain old 2D you're wasting your time and money! The movie was enhanced by 3D! With that said I am going to nominate this movie for the best Action, Best special effects, Best Computer special effects (At least they didn't get me dizzy in 3D) First movie I have ever watched in 3D that didn't give me a Headache! Absolutely amazing and it stayed true to the original storytelling of its founder from Marvel! Thank you and I believe this movie will be overlooked because some people think comic books are for children. hope everyone can just overlook everything else and commend the amazing special effects that went off like a perfect concert in sync!"
" Decent intro to the mystic arts.
",0.0,0.9825,2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Going on to about a dozen films or so in the Marvel Universe, there comes a point when you have to present something new to the audience. Everyone was on board with the individual films, which led to the team up of the Avengers. People were blown away with how well they pulled that off. Shift to the second phase of films and we get some decent and generic sequels. Knowing early on that they had to spice things up a bit, Marvel took a chance on some third party characters, hoping that they were unique enough to be considered ""refreshing"". So we are introduced to Guardians and Ant-Man. This seemed to hold the fans attention for a bit longer. Now were closing in on another set of films and I'm sure Marvel was asking themselves, what can we show them now? Their answer is Doctor Strange. A wonderful kaleidoscope of imagery to grab your attention, despite the same tepid story Marvel has been chugging out for years now. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, the movies are all good in my book, but I feel that the spectacle will not be the only offering people want in the next phase of films. Strange is a genius surgeon, the best in his field. The only thing that matches his talents is his arrogance...hmmm, sounds like another goatee wearing hero on the marvel universe. Anyway, one night while driving, he ends up in a terrible accident, which destroys his hands. Determined not to live a life of mediocrity, believing he is better than that, Strange dedicates his life to bettering himself. The search takes him to some far corners of the earth and opens his eyes to a new healing power, the power of magic. Quickly learning his new formed powers, Strange must battle some guy who has some evil plan....this is where the story gets a little generic and forgettable. So forgettable, that I forget the villains name, I only remember that he was played by Mads Mikkelsen.That has been one universal issue that everyone agrees on when it comes to Marvel films. The lack of a compelling villain. Save for Loki, the Marvel films have continuously dropped the ball in this department. They seemed to try and steer back into the right direction with this year's Civil War, but Strange seems to throw them back down a peg as Mikkelsen is not given enough screen time to shine. Before I look anything up, if I recall correctly. He was a former student of the Ancient One, who has suffered some personal loss. This turns him evil and he teams up with a giant cloud monster to bring the destruction of earth. Hmm, some pretty hollow motivation if you ask me. So I'll copy and paste some info from the Marvel wiki to clear some of that motivation up.Kaecilius was a sorcerer and a former member of the Masters of the Mystic Arts who became disillusioned with the Ancient One when he felt his mentor was not allowing other dimensions to come to Earth, which he believed could reunite him with his deceased wife and son. He formed the Zealots with the intention of defeating the Ancient One and bringing the inter-dimensional being known as Dormammu to Earth. So with this new information in my mind, I still stand by the fact that these films tend to drop the ball on the villains. So where does the film excel? Well, for starters the aforementioned Ancient One, played by Tilda Swinton. I'll admit, at first I was not a fan of her. Her alien like features and dramatic turns seemed to turn me off of her acting in previous films, but I have since developed a new found appreciation for her. I guess if she sticks to genre flicks or quirky comedies, I like her. She is the highlight in Doctor Strange for me. Cumberbatch does well enough for himself, he plays the arrogant jerk to perfection, but he will have more time to develop that role. For now, this film belongs to Swinton. Rounding out the rest of the supporting cast is Chiwetel Ejiofor, with an irritating character arc and Rachel McAdams, relegated to being the girlfriend sidekick. I mentioned earlier the kaleidoscope imagery...I literally meant that. The background images of this film were obviously inspired by the images one would find looking through the glass of the toy. Strange takes the Inception leveled effects and kicks it up a notch and to great effect. These visuals are what makes the film stand out from the other entries. Strange's first venture into other dimensions is trippy enough to warrant a viewing. Doctor Strange is another generic entry into the Marvel franchise, but those generic entries are still pretty damn entertaining. The film fumbles with the villain and some forced comedic bits that don't land, but is strong enough entertaining you that you might not mind. It cleverly sidesteps the usual ""city destruction"" climax and turns it on its head. Doctor Strange is a welcomed addition to the series."
