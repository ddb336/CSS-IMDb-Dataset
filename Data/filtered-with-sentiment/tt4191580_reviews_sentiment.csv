" so stupid
",-0.5709,-0.7031,2020-06-15 00:00:00,4,"Very stupid stereotypical humor. If you consider the film as a parody, then it's also a bit too bad. 4/10"
" Awful movie
",-0.4588,-0.7351,2020-04-26 00:00:00,1,"Awful acting, awful jokes and some of the parts you can even dare to say: do it the other way around and you'll see the backlash.
Avoid this at all costs."
" Worst movie I have ever seen
",-0.6249,0.3612,2020-04-17 00:00:00,1,The whole movie feels like someone wrote a script and decided to turn it into a movie before proof reading it. A piece of incoherent trash.
" Ghetto Moves to Beverly Hills
",0.0,0.9734,2019-12-07 00:00:00,2,"Ah, Beverly Hills. Everyone likes a good movie straight out of the most expensive zip code in the world. This movie follows in the lines of those movies. Many are bad, some are good. It's just the way these movies about the rich and poor usually work.Meet the Blacks is about a man from the ghettos of Chicago who steals drug money after an arrest of its owner. He picks up and moves his family to the Hills. Little do they know that an annual purge is happening on that day. Now, the family must not only defend themselves from the gangsters out to retrieve their money, but also from their rich well to do neighbors.Mike Epps is a really funny guy, in contexts. Here he does an average job of amusing the audience, but it's darn sure he knows how to take the lead place in a film. Everything seems to surround him, and it also gives me the feeling of the ""Friday"" character all grown up and independent from his uncle. The family aspects are there, but do not seem to shine as much as the purge plot. I wish this movie had more normal interactions with the neighbors, so we could see the difference between the rich and poor, and Epps could use his humor in that context. All in all, it was a pretty bad movie.The movie relies a lot on horror. It gets dark really quickly, and we are left there wanting to bring the humor back. It doesn't come back.2 stars"
" Terrible waste of time
",-0.7096,0.5719,2019-09-08 00:00:00,9,"I'm a huge fan of comedies especially parodies. When there done right the laughs can last an eternity. It's movies like these that
are rushed with a bad script that ruin other parody films."
" Some funny scenes and quotes...that's as far as it goes
",0.4404,0.5921,2019-07-16 00:00:00,4,"So...as I say in the title..the movie has a couple of funny scenes and a couple of funny quotes (probably the funniest one being the dialogue with Mike Tyson), but this is as far as this comedy / parody goes..not a waste of time...but not a masterpiece of its kind either...something pretty descent to watch when you are on a plane and have nothing better to watch or read..certainly not worthy of a 6!"
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,0.2472,2019-06-01 00:00:00,4,"The movie doesn't deserve your time.
It is not a comedy or horror, it is just silly."
" Well then....
",0.2732,0.8878,2019-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Alright! So, my husband and I watched this movie because the trailer looked stupid. But I figured we've watched some dumb comedies before, what's the worst that could happen. Yikes! This movie.....it had moments when I was like this isn't that bad then 2 seconds later I'm like ""scratch that"". But the strange thing was I couldn't stop it. I felt the need to finish it even though there were times that I thought ""I'm never going to get this hour and a half back"". Ready for the real kicker in the end it says ""to be continued..."" and I actually feel like I'm going to watch it. This is why I'd say it's a 5 because it wasn't so bad I wanted to rip my eyes out and ears off but it wasn't something that had me laughing so hard I was crying."
" This is for... a special kind of humor.
",0.5859,0.9395,2018-11-29 00:00:00,10,"Okay listen for a minute. This movie is absolutely hilarious, but you do have to a certain type of humor as well. The movie contains a lot, like a lot of profanity, which makes it soooooo much funnier. Give it a try, and if you dont like it the first 10 minutes you will hate the rest, trust me. Personally, have i never laughed this much in my entire life. 11/10."
" LOL (Not )
",0.5473,-0.6059,2018-10-31 00:00:00,3,"This is the worse film that I have watched this year, I hate giving a bad review, but it's rubbish."
" Utter drivel
",0.0,0.0844,2018-10-17 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe I wasted my time on this. 90 odd minutes of my life that I will never get back. Stick with the first purge movie, not this toss."
" Awkward and unfunny
",-0.1531,-0.0602,2018-10-09 00:00:00,3,"Didn't have any real laughs. The build-up to the purge was kinda ok, though it had many forced jokes already. Once the purge started it got really messy and ridiculous. I really started to lose my attention from there on. The movie hasn't ended yet, but I had to come spill my guts here. I like parodies, but this isn't a good one, no sir."
" Really, skip it, very very bad !
",-0.6557,-0.9542,2018-09-23 00:00:00,1,"This movie stinks. I didin't even make it past the 20 min. mark. Therefore 1/10. A score of 6.1 is totally absurd but that's because there are not enough ""independent"" reviews.
About the content of the movie a lot is already said. Bad acting, bad stereotypes, jokes that aren't funny at all 'cause the writers & producers can't grasp the concept of irony & sarcasm, it's just childish profanity, the camera work is cheap and shaky,... To keep it short, this is not even a B-movie, just low budget rubbish with a quasi stolen title, hoping to squeeze some money out of people with the premise they promise in the description."
" Hilarious version of The Purge
",0.4019,0.5512,2018-09-15 00:00:00,6,"I didn't have very high hopes when I started watching it, since it's a comedy and they are usually not that good imo, but it was actually really funny. They did a good job!"
" This is not worth it!
",-0.2401,-0.955,2018-08-30 00:00:00,1,"My first review, and maybe my 3rd or 4th rating. 
I love the most movies and series, so I never rate them if it isn't amazing. But this movie is a waste of time. 
I saw 14 minutes and stopped it. The next day I saw 20 minutes more, just to give lt a chance but it suuuucks! It's so cringy and stupid without being funny. The cast is ok but they can't act in this movie because the script is SO terrible. Later that same day I thought ""watch the movie maybe it's ok"" but now I just wanna sue both netflix, the cast, the producers and the writers. 
Don't watch this crap it's a wate of time and your life."
" Would recommend if you're high
",0.3612,-0.1035,2018-08-28 00:00:00,5,"The movie is not good at all but parody movies are not supposed to be amazing film works. The problem is that the jokes should be funny, but not in this one. If you want to waste your time watching a dumb movie (as we sometimes do) you could watch this one."
" Predictable but good
",0.5927,0.772,2018-08-27 00:00:00,5,I liked this comedy make of The Purge and thought that it seemed more realistic than the purge due to how some of the characters acted. I also thought that this was really repetitive however which did take away from the movie for me and I wish they showed more of the background of the Blacks and why they were being hunted but an easy watch.
" Avoid
",-0.296,-0.8441,2018-08-27 00:00:00,2,"Not funny at all, had to stop watching this cause it was so bad. Skip it"
" Hideous movie
",0.0,-0.5736,2018-08-19 00:00:00,1,"Not funny, not a parody, a lot of shouting, shooting and not even a good parody of The Purge, the message is hammered home, they even threaten at the end to make Meet the Blacks 2, hopefully that project never sees the light of day."
" So bad it's pitiful
",-0.8051,-0.8729,2018-08-15 00:00:00,1,"This is what you get when the movie is made by people who consider confusing editing a substitute for writing, and allusions to racism and rape-comedy. It's not even a tolerable slasher or ""so bad it's good"" thing. It doesn't step into surreal and seems to play it all seriously at points, which is simply disturbing."
" Not a single laugh....Not a single funny line... AVOID at all costs
",-0.0085,-0.8256,2018-08-14 00:00:00,1,"Other than the paid reviews giving it 9 or 10, the actual rating of this movie should be anywhere between 0 and 1 (out of 10 course). If you like people screaming and swearing and not a word that can be classified as remotely funny, then this movie is for you. Not worth even watching on rental. Overacting and crappy script coupled with equally terrible acting from every single actor...boy o boy this was one horrible movie....AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
" I'm not sure how I feel about this
",-0.2411,-0.9627,2018-04-12 00:00:00,6,"There were parts of the movie that was funny but majority of the movie was offensive, stereotypical and racist. Every black son't come from the hood. Is there a reason I haven't ran across positive movies of blacks yet on Netflix? This movie really just made me feel some type of way. This keeps hate going. Whatever images are displayed to your eyes can be really bad. Netflix you know what you are doing when you create movies like tis..."
" I LOLed hard!
",-0.1759,-0.542,2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"These reviews are very polarized, I guess it has a specific type of humor that is not for everyone. Better check yourself before you wreck yourself!"
" You got pieces of ear in your teeth
",0.0,0.5065,2017-11-25 00:00:00,4,"Carl Black (Mike Epps) absconds with drug money as he takes his family to lie low in a gated community in Beverly Hills. Being a dead beat, Carl has a lot of people looking for him leaving behind including baby mommas. On the night of ""The Purge"" they all come looking for him, even the clown ( Mike Tyson) he stiffed from his kid's birthday party.This is a spoof of ""The Purge"" and perhaps needed a better title. The bulk of the humor is racial and inter-racial as we contrast red bones vs. black people. I would suppose the African-American community will enjoy this comedy more than I did. While the film had its moments, the humor grew old with all the accidental and misdirected deaths.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Zulay Henao in swimsuit for eye candy."
" No jokes
",-0.0516,-0.6452,2017-09-07 00:00:00,6,"I barely laughed. I barely succeeded to sketch a smile. Mike Epps tries to be goofy, but he doesn't make it in the end and the rest of the characters are there just to fill the gaps. I think the movie had to only focus on one genre and not to be both a creepy-drama and a comedy. All the things got messed up and it resulted more in an unsatisfied & unhappy audience. At least these are the feelings that this movie left me."
" Fun Purging
",0.5106,0.8808,2017-06-10 00:00:00,4,"No scary movies anymore? Sound fine, but I reckon we get this instead. And while it does have to say something about racism in America (yes still a thing), it also gets repetitive and sort of boring in its attempts to make fun of the Purge series. The Purge is now so over the top, it should be easy to make fun of it.Way easier than what we see here and while there are some fun ideas thrown at you, not many stick (pun intended). There are a lot of guest appearances, one in particular by Charlie Murphy, that might be uncomfortable for some to watch, considering the fact he recently passed away. But those feelings aside, it does not really have the quality to entertain fully as it could"
" Didn't really like it
",-0.3241,-0.3716,2017-02-21 00:00:00,3,"Now I don't usually go for comedies but my boyfriend wanted to watch it. I know this movie is supposed to be stupid and funny, but I just found it to be stupid and annoying. I mean, I guess it had a few moments but they were few. I didn't really find it funny. But everybody's sense of humor is different."
