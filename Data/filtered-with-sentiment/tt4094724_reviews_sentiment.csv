" If you ignore...
",0.0,0.6705,2021-03-28 00:00:00,6,"Like the other purge movies, If you ignore the many huge plot holes and illogical attitudes, you can enjoy this film."
" Excellent if you're in need of a good laugh
",0.8807,0.9694,2021-02-14 00:00:00,2,The 2 dimensional characters had me literally laughing on the floor. One bag guy was a tattooed skin head with Nazi symbols and confederate patches all over his jacket. The purge people in the church are all old rich white people. At the end there is an electoral map that shows conservatives are all purge loving demons while lefty states are all pure peace loving people. The move is extremely predictable...and actually really funny.
" I Think This May Be My Favourite Now
",0.0,0.8164,2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,"To be 3 films in and it's this good, just shows how far they can go with this franchise. This was really gripping, suspenseful and had a great story."
" Better than the last two, but far from great
",0.8225,0.9875,2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,"An improvement upon Anarchy and certainly over the original, The Purge: Election Year attempts to try a new point of view by putting us on the political side of things- and while it has its flaws- it's certainly the most entertaining entry yet. To be fair, I am not a huge fan of these films. I find the writing rather lazy at times, and this film is no exception. Much of the dialogue feels clunky, good ideas perhaps at times, but very out of place, and even forced at times. Quite a few of the smaller supporting actors also feel very out of place as well, with their performances sticking out like sore thumbs due to their inability to act- and almost obvious excitement to be on camera. Mostly though, the main performances are pretty solid this time around. Frank Grillo obviously shines again as bada** Leo Dush, as well as Elizabeth Mitchell as Senator Charlie Roan and a smaller but often well done performance from Betty Gabriel as Laney Rucker. The film can be hard to take seriously at times, almost overdoing it as well as providing accidental satire seemingly at times, but it also plays into the pure fun of it. The action is well done in the film, and it kept my attention nearly all the way through. I didn't expect much from it, but it's a fine and entertaining little action film. Nothing special, but nothing bad either.
My Rating: 7.25/10"
" Socially simbolic and intelligent, but it lacks execution
",0.25,0.0402,2021-01-25 00:00:00,7,"The best of the series, especially focusing on the conceptual aspect, making it memorable for me at the point that I even considered giving it an 8. Nevertheless, the execution didn't allow me to do that.We all have an idea of how our society can be unfair in terms of giving equal life opportunities or even of making it possible for people to stabilize their access to basic human rights and dignity, but this movie adresses this topic on cruel levels. It doesn't avoid showing how brutal the system can be when protecting itself, a distopic exaggeration of what lies beneath our social piramid. This way, it provides remarkable insights that not only expand the movie series relevance, but also avoids the common horror, action or thriller movies initial expectations.Although its creative concept, it simply lacks execution. Part of the reflections are given up too ""dry"", varying between not-developed and previsible as the movie goes on. Also, the pace and the plot's main line sometimes bother, as they repeat some of The Purge: Anarchy's errors like engaging on some endless, previsible and weak pursuit sequences. But let me be fair: there are also lots of good scenes and parts to enjoy.In sum, this is the most political movie of The Purge's, delivering reflections worth having nowadays, but don't expect a major execution or a consistent pace. Even so, if you wanna know how to defend human basic rights on an action/horror movie, this can be a good example of how to."
" They're still making sequels to this embarrassing movie?
",-0.4588,-0.4404,2021-01-18 00:00:00,3,"Oh, come on. I still don't believe that they're making sequels to that disastrous film. The first purge was embarrassment and that cannot be recovered by doing any sequels. God bless these guys."
" Lost the concept of purge.
",-0.3182,-0.6318,2020-12-20 00:00:00,4,This part wasn't that much nice if compared to last two parts. The plot was quite weak but yes you can watch it and tolerate the boring scenes. This part really lost the path of purge .
" 12 hours to survive on the election year!
",0.0,-0.6808,2020-12-17 00:00:00,3,Needless to say that this movie makes the timeline of the franchise confusing: how come Leo is still that hot 18 years after the events of The Purge 2? It's the weakest movie in the saga so far. This one feels like a weak action movie.
" The best of the purge series
",0.6369,0.4927,2020-12-12 00:00:00,7,Really enjoyable movie. The most logical of the purge movies
" [7.7] 72% tension
",-0.3182,0.6553,2020-11-22 00:00:00,8,"The third movie in the installment, it's much better than the previous (Anarchy) IMO; it is more intense, well-made and is more violent than emotional.
Of course, that's The Purge - Nobody, in his right mind, looks at the logic factor.(+-) Good screenplay. More show of violence with more tension.(+-) Good acting. Believable and dramatic. Frank Grillo is the right fit here as well as in Anarchy.(+) Has more suspense and tension. Macho.(+-) Good action with some psychotic moments and bloody scenes. The blood however was inky and not good enough.Does it do justice to the essence of the Purge? 75% yes.Overall a mildly+ satisfying movie, less violence filtering and more true to the essence of The Purge night."
" Had Potential, but Aspired to Only Be a Video Game
",0.0,0.9857,2020-11-22 00:00:00,5,"All these years and after all of the sequels, I never actually saw any of ""The Purge"" movies until today when I caught this one. It was intriguing to see what it was all about, but as much as I gave it a chance to impress me, it never quite turned into even a B-level classic like some action movies do.Repetitive, predictable, cliched, yet sometimes entertaining and slightly impressive, it never ascends beyond a run of the mill action movie, and it really felt like watching someone play a modern video game, from scenes to lines the actors and actresses have.Frank Grillo's hair was too much of a distraction, and I felt like I was watching Ryan Seacrest play the role of the action hero too often.5/10"
" The Purge: Election Year
",0.0,-0.9993,2020-11-07 00:00:00,4,"The Purge started the franchise as a simple home invasion movie, and the sequel, Anarchy, expanded the concept by having characters going out during the annual 12-hour period of legalised crime, this third film was rated low, but I was always going to watch it. Basically, in 2017, the 28th amendment of the U.S. Constitution is approved, establishing one night a year, 7pm March 21 to 7am March 22, ""The Purge"", in which all crime, including murder, theft, arson and rape is permitted, and all police, fire, and medical emergency services are unavailable for 12 hours. The only rules of the Purge are that high level government officials are not to be disturbed, and high grade weapons, such as explosives, grenades, bazookas, rocket launchers and so on, are forbidden. Those who violate these rules will be publicly executed by hanging. The Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting and a stronger economy. It is intended for catharsis (releasing rage), but in reality, it is a method of artificial population control, as unemployed and poor people are usually the main targets. In 2022, young Charlene ""Charlie"" Roan (Christy Coco) and her family are tied up by a masked purger, who forces her mother to choose the sole survivor of his evil game, ""Mommy's Choice"". Charlie is chosen and forced to watch as her mother, father, and brother are killed. Eighteen years later, in 2040, Roan (Lost's Elizabeth Mitchell) is a U.S. Senator campaigning to become President of the United States, promising to bring an end to the Purge. Former police sergeant Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) is now head of security for Roan. The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) and their candidate, Minister Edwidge Owens (Kyle Secor), view Roan as a threat. Under the pretence of regaining public trust, they revoke immunity for government officials, including her, on Purge night. Meanwhile, deli owner Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson), his assistant Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria), and former purger turned emergency medical technician Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel) watch the presidential debate on television. A pair of teenage girls (Brittany Mirabile and Juani Feliz) try to shoplift, they are cornered by Joe and mock him, but they recognise Laney as a former purger and leave peacefully. Joe receives a call regarding his Purge insurance, the cos has ben raised and he cannot afford it, prompting him to guard his store himself, despite Marcos and Laney's pleas not to. At the same time, the country's so-called ""Murder tourism"" boost the economy as many tourists visit the U.S. to participate in the annual Purge night. As the Purge begins, Joe guards his store and is joined by Marcos, repelling an attack by the teenage girls seeking revenge. Laney and her partner Dawn (Liza Col√≥n-Zayas) patrol the city in an ambulance, providing medical care to the wounded. Roan decides to wait out the Purge from her home rather than a secure location to secure the vote, accompanied by Barnes, Chief Couper (Ethan Phillips), Eric Busmalis (Adam Cantor), and additional security forces. However, Couper and Eric are revealed to be NFFA operatives, and allow a neo-Nazi paramilitary force led by Earl Danzinger (Terry Serpico) to kill security and invade the house. Barnes escorts Roan to safety, he is wounded by gunshot, but he detonates a bomb in the house, killing Eric and Couper. Barnes and Roan try to find shelter as they navigate through the hostile streets of Washington D.C. but are ambushed by a gang of Murder Tourists. Before they can be executed, Joe and Marcos kill the gang, having seen them from the store roof. As they take shelter in the store, the teens return with reinforcements. However, Laney runs over two of them and kills half the group. As the other Purgers threaten to break in, they leave for a safer hideout. The team is ambushed by Danzinger in a helicopter and seeks refuge beneath an overpass. Barnes realises the bullet in his shoulder is a tracking device, which he promptly removes. The group encounter a large group of Crips but are let go after helping their leader. In return, the Crips plant the bullet in another area as a diversion for the paramilitary team. The team arrives at an underground anti-purge hideout run by Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge). Bishop's group intends to assassinate the NFFA's leadership, wanting to end the purge. As Roan pleads to Bishop's partner, Angel Munoz (Naheem Garcia), not to kill Owens, they are alerted a large paramilitary group are on their way. Barnes and Roan escape back to the streets and reunite with Joe, Marcos, and Laney, who temporarily left them to return to Joe's store. As they flee the city, the ambulance is hit by Danzinger's team, and Roan is pulled from the van by the soldiers following the crash. Barnes leads the group and Bishop's team to a fortified cathedral where the NFFA, including loyalist Harmon James (Christopher James Baker), will ""sacrifice"" her. Before Roan can be killed, the group arrives and Marcos assassinates U.S. President and NFFA leader Caleb Warrens (Raymond J. Barry), causing a shootout that kills the entire congregation except Owens and James, who escape. Roan manages to persuade Bishop's group to spare Owens, thus allowing her to still have a chance to win the election. The remaining paramilitary forces arrive, killing Bishop and his team. Danzinger and Barnes engage in a brutal fight, which ends when Barnes beats and stabs Danzinger to death. As Roan and the team free the other imprisoned Purge victims, James emerges, kills a released prisoner before engaging with Joe in a gunfight. Despite his fatal injuries, Joe manages to kill James with a shot to the head. He asks Laney and Marcos to take care of his store before dying of his injuries, as the Purge comes to an end. Two months later, Roan wins the election by a landslide, and Barnes is appointed the new Director of the Secret Service. Marcos and Laney renovate Joe's store, which was looted and destroyed, they continue to run it in his memory. A news report then states that NFFA supporters have staged violent uprisings across the country protesting the election result and the end of the annual Purge. Also starring Roman Blat as Uncle Sam. The third entry in the franchise again makes the most of the outside destructive legal crime sprees, the political and ethical issues are much more obvious this time, the survival of the fittest premise is still brutal, and there is a fair amount of blood spill and explosions, but it is a little slow and uneven a lot of the time, not scary and not as good as previously perhaps, but not a terrible dystopian action horror film. Okay!"
" Seriously?
",-0.1779,0.7906,2020-10-11 00:00:00,1,"The NFFA could stay in power forever by rigging presidential elections, just like other regimes have done in real life. Or by abolishing elections altogether. It's illogical that they would allow credible political opponents to challenge them in free and fair elections. Smh"

" Purge for the People!
",0.0,0.5511,2020-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Feisty presidential candidate Senator Charlie Roan (a fine and appealing portrayal by Elizabeth Mitchell) gets targeted for death by her ultra-conservative rivals on purge night. It's up to former police sergeant turned chief security guy Leo Barnes (a solid performance by Frank Grillo) to protect Roan for the twelve hours that the purge goes on for.Writer/director James DeMonaco keeps the gripping story moving along at a snappy pace, expertly builds plenty of tension, stages the plentiful exciting action with skill and flair, offers several chilling images of raw brutality and savagery, and further tops things off with a handy helping of biting satirical social commentary that takes fierce potshots at such worthy targets as the religious right, the rich exploiting and victimizing the poor for their own greedy gain, and the appalling entitlement of the younger generation (the candy bar girl gang in particular are total hoots and a half!). The sound acting by the able cast keeps this movie humming: Mykelti Williamson as affable deli owner Joe Dixon, Joseph Julian Soria as Dixon's loyal buddy Marcos, Betty Gabriel as the tough Laney Rucker, Kyle Secor as the smarmy Minister Edwigde Owens, Terry Serpico as ruthless mercenary Earl Danzinger, Brittany Mirabile as spoiled brat Kimmy, Edwin Hodge as impassioned resistance fighter Dante Bishop, and Raymond J. Barry as the slimy Leader Caleb Warrens. Good nasty fun. And don't forget to purge for your country."
" Thrilling for all the wrong reasons
",0.0,-0.8402,2020-09-07 00:00:00,6,"First, let's say very predictable. This is the second grisly sequel following the terrifying struggle of citizens trying once again to survive the 12 hours of legalized killing and mayhem. A Presidential candidate, Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell), is targeted. Police Sergeant Barnes (Frank Grillo) heads her security and vows to keep her safe.Also in the cast: Mykelti Williamson, Betty Gabriel, Joseph Julian Sonia, Liza Colon-Zayas and Terry Serpico."
" More silly, more entertaining
",0.5926,0.7523,2020-07-25 00:00:00,6,"This review contains spoilersThe Purge: Election Year is directed by James DeMonaco and stars Frank Grillo and Elizabeth Mitchell. The movie is set after The Purge: Anarchy and Leo Barnes the Sargent is now the head of security for Senator Charlie Roan, played by Elizabeth Mitchell. The senator wishes to end the purge and seeks election as President of the United States. The political party that created the purge, the new Founding Fathers hires a mercenary group to kill the senator.The plot and the writing in this third movie is still not improved. Much of the problems are still here and not even hand waved by the universe. There are even more plot contrivances. One of these is a shop owner whose purge insurance is cancelled in order to elevate the tension. This is not the only event and the movie is filled with these plot devices.The movie is improved in some ways. The tone is not as serious as The Purge: Anarchy. Besides the plot devices, the violence is more organic here with the mercenary groups having a clear motive to hurt the main characters. More of the political system and society is explained this movie. The main cast of Frank Grillo and Elizabeth Mitchell are great here. The two leads have good chemistry. Even though the leads relation is basic, it does feel that the two characters care for one another. The villains seem more exaggerated in their silliness here. This lends to the less serious tone in the movie. The Purge: Election Year is recommended. It does better than its previous entry, but not greatly improve upon it. The action has more context on it now, and makes the movie better overall.This being the third movie in The Purge trilogy, the trilogy as a whole is inconsistent. The tone of the movies are wild with each one oscillating in its logic. The first movie sets up the world but its actually more elaborated in this movie. Overall the trilogy's concept is good, but the execution has been lackluster. The first movie is good for its simplicity. The second movie tried to expand on its setting but did not improve the writing. The third movie is a mix of the first two with a less serious tone.Grade: C"
" Great
",0.6249,0.8268,2020-07-06 00:00:00,9,One of the best movies of the purge universe. I really enjoy all the purge movies this one my favourite
" Perfect since today is 4th of July and it's election year
",0.5719,0.9858,2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,"Very underrated sequel with some incredibly thrilling bits! I have a YouTube video of the beginning scene that got more than 20K views which is cool would be nice if more subscribed that's ok though; I do wish the guy that was in the beginning bit was in the movie more would've been awesome! I love this whacky one, I'm happy it's got more horror than the others. Great fun entertainment it'd be wild if a purge was real."
" A no brainer... literally.
",-0.296,-0.5868,2020-06-29 00:00:00,1,"The premise of this series is so utterly dumb and nonsensical that it isn't even enough to turn off you brain for this, you need to start without a functioning one to begin with.If you want this gimmicky horo-sit-com to punch you in the face repeatedly, then you are a tasteless, culture-less dumbbell and you should hang your head in shame.The scary thing about the popularity of the dilapidated pulp is that the odds are very much in favour of the country where is flaccid aneurysm of a movie was concocted, could very well decent into similar chaos in the next few years for the same reasons a certain audience reacts positively to this trash.. Malevolent and/or lazy stupidity!"
" Better the purge
",0.4404,0.4404,2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,This third movie is the better of saga of the purge
" Disappointing. It's the 3rd Purge movie and there was nothing new.
",-0.4939,0.9309,2020-06-01 00:00:00,4,"Acting was pretty bland.
The plot felt like an early 2000's movies.
Super cliche scenes, nothing you've never seen.
No plot twists, the whole movie was just a huge cliche.
There were more holes in the plot than there were in the wooden panes those guys were hiding behind.
Directing could have saved the movie. It did not, it was mediocre at best.
The idea itself is good, but come on! It's the 3rd Purge movie and there was nothing new.
Disappointed."

" Worst Purge
",-0.6249,-0.8519,2020-02-27 00:00:00,5,It is boring and just mindless violence. I would skip it.
" Propaganda in its purest form
",-0.25,-0.0322,2020-02-24 00:00:00,2,"I will draw the connections for you. A presidential female candidate (clinton) decides to stay at home during the purge night to support her campaign. Then, somebody lets in the evil military (nra, they literally say n..a) whose boss is an evil national socialist. They then bring her in a church where all the founding fathers are (republicans) to be sacrificed. After that, African americans attempt to save the candidate and sacrifice themselves in the process. That... i have no words... But as a movie itself it wasnt so bad, i'd give it a 6/10, but -4 for that liberal BS propaganda. Sorry."

" GOOD ATMOSPHERIC FUN WITH THE CULT HERO FRANK GRILLO, A SOLID THRILLER
",0.8957,0.9211,2019-12-12 00:00:00,7,"""Election Year"" is good solid late night fun.It's great to see the excellent Frank Grillo return as his now iconic role as Leo Barnes, the tough vigilante warrior from the excellent ""Anarchy"" but this time Leo is working as a bodyguard for an upcoming presidential candidate & is just as rugged, tough & deadly but doesn't look as cool as he did in Anarchy but he's still a total badass Action hero.""ELECTION YEAR"" is a full on political approach & a what if? Sci-fi Thriller, it's often scary because it asks what if America got this bad & those in power are always corrupted & this could happen!!! It's a fantasy theory but fun because America is a mess & so violent. Grillo is back as tough guy Leo Barnes but he's not as good as he was when he was a Punisher style Vigilante in ""Anarchy"" but he's not supposed to be as now he's a man of the law as a Bodyguard & not a revenge fuelled angry Vigilante, IT'S still a good performance & he still has that intensity & seriousness that Grillo does greatly & he's teamed up protecting Elizabeth Mitchell as Senator Charlie Roan, she gives a good panicked but strong lady performance & really works well with Grillo.
The rest of the ensemble cast is great such as my 2nd fave character in the movie after Leo Barnes, we have Joe Dixon played by Mykelti Williamson a shop owner who is fighting to keep his local store business from being destroyed during the purge, he's a great character as he's funny but not silly & he's brave & smart, it's a great performance!!! The rest are all fine but those three stand out to me.
There's corruption, set ups, conspiracy & psycho Mercenaries mixed into this politically charged sci-fi Action Thriller.There's a decent spooky atmosphere & some scary gangs out there hunting with dead presidents masks & scarily feels very relevant in todays ultra-violent & politically corrupted times!!!! A solid Thriller"
" Overacting film
",0.0,0.2716,2019-12-10 00:00:00,4,"I really liked the first movie, and recently i watch the election year. They transform a good movie and idea into a bad film, too exaggerated."
" Goes political and loses its charm
",0.1027,0.4767,2019-09-19 00:00:00,4,"The first two Purge films in the franchise were interesting and there was progression with the second film- Anarchy improving upon the original. However with Election Year, the mystery and suspense is gone. This film is more predictable and the characters are a step down in interest.Frank Grillo reprises his time from Anarchy but we know more about him, and what made him interesting in the first was that he was a mysterious type drifter and had chemistry with those female leads. Here his character feels more dumbed down and far less intimidating.Election Year is longer and feels like it as it drags and is somewhat boring at times. Also a lot of political and propaganda plot devices takes away from it. What makes it lesser than the previous two films is it feels like a rehash of Anarchy.Though what does make this film interesting at parts is the stranger/survivor from the first two films is given a name and has more screen time, and he steals his scenes. Unfortunately his character dies.As for this film, it looked like it was intended in being the last Purge film, though since it was a big box office hit, they of course made another film in the franchise."

I have always said that, for the sake of realism, there should be more sex crimes (either depicted or simply implied) in the films. So far, the films have been careful to avoid any thought of sex - from a lack of love scenes to a lack of sexy costumes. This film is the first to feature sexuality, so at least we are getting closer. Brittany Mirabile is outstanding and sexy as hell - perfect casting for the sexy villain.New concepts featured in this film include the lifting of Purge restrictions on elected officials, a guillotine, 'Purge Tourists' from other countries that travel here to kill US citizens, mobile first aid stations (like the Red Cross) that risk their lives to save injured people, and insurance rate hikes prior to Purge night.As long as these films continue to explore the dark possibilities of Purge night in realistic and creative ways, they will continue to be successful.

" Good sequel set in a pseudo-apocalyptic future with chills, shocks and loads of violence
",-0.5859,-0.0246,2019-09-06 00:00:00,6,"This thrilling picture results to be a futuristic yarn full of kinetic energy and amazing stunt work . It contains mystery , chills , noisy action , thrills , fights , social critical , and a weird atmosphere with dark with a surprising ending . The known and unrealistic premise of ""The Purge"" developing in the first installment is the following : The idea behind this whole futuristic America is that the Economy is down and Crime is up , as authorities put a lot of emphasis on murder being legal , that's why they believe assassinations would get better problems . It is just universally accepted that the cause of all these troubles is built up aggression within the human population. In order to correct this, the United States Government decides that it would be a good idea to give the public a day to ""release the aggression"". So, one day of each year, they will have an annual ""Purge"" where all crime is legal , including killing . Somehow, magically, this does help the Economy and Crime overall is down for the rest of the year. Because if people get out all that anger in one day, they will not feel the need to commit any more crimes for the rest of the year . This third outing is set some years later from first entry , it's been two years since Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo who reprises the character of former police sergeant Leo Barnes) stopped himself from a regrettable act of vendetta on Purge Night . Nowadays serving as head of security for Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) , who is promising to end the annual purge nights , she is competing at national election against another candidate , Minister Edwidge Owens (Kyle Secor) . The New Founding Fathers of America's (NFFA) leader, Caleb Warrens (Raymond J. Barry) and their candidate, Minister Edwidge Owens, view Roan as a threat; in the guise of regaining the public's trust, revoke immunity for rank 10 or higher government officials to kill her on Purge night . Charlie's mission is to protect her in a run for president and survive the annual ritual that targets the poor and innocent . They have to confront a really ruthless gang of masked killers led by Earl Danzinger (Terry Serpico) . But a betrayal forces them onto the streets of D.C. on the one night when no help is available . Along the way the security agent and the Senator are helped by a motley group of brave people called Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) , Marcos (Joseph Soria) and Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel) . As they must stay alive until dawn...or both be sacrificed for their sins against the state . I Purged . For one night only, America invites you to its annual tradition . Keep America Great .Purge for the People .Purge for the Nation . Purge for the Power .Purge for Your Liberty . Purge for the Glory. Witness the birth of an American tradition. Citizens, join the Purge. A nation reborn. It Changed Our Country. It Challenged Our Beliefs. Now, Witness How It All Began.The film is a comic-books style story , set in a dystopian nearly future , plenty of energetic action , shootouts , extreme violence , thriller , surprise-filled entertainment and high body-count . The tale is a blending of ordinary Sci-Fi movies , such as : Escape from N.Y , 2013 : Rescue in L.A. , Doomsday , and even Mad Max series , taking parts here and there . Instead of attempting to be a terror movie , it turns a fantastic thriller/action film set in a pseudo-apocalyptic future about a group of people trying to survive on a night where it's all-out war on the streets . This exciting movie is packed with frenetic action , crossfire , unbelievable car stunts , tension , thrills , chills , and lots of blood and gore, including throating-slit , beheading and anything else . The nail-biting action scenes are uniformly very well done , and the suspense and intrigue are enough to keep you interested throughout the film runtime , even in the low parts of the picture . This Great Action Thriller was the final movie in the ""Purge"" trilogy (2013-2016) until a prequel was made : The First Purge (2018) . It displays a magnificent plethora of characters , pretty well drawn , giving exceptional performances by its entire cast .This is a decent movie and well set in a post-apocalyptic D.C. , dealing with a valient group who will have to fight cruel disguised cutthroats , bands of depraved crazies ; packing frantic action , shocks as well as abundant violence, being professionaly directed by James de Monaco . And it even has earned more money at the box office than its predecessor . Monaco is a good writer/producer and director . He has written the Purge saga and Purge TV series ; and Assault on Precinct 13 , Skinwalkers , Negotiator , Hate , Staten Island , The kill Point series , Crash series . And he has directed The Purge films ; this horror/thriller franchise is formed by The Purge 2013 , The Purge: Anarchy 2014 , Election year 2016 , and The First Purge 2018 . All of them are set in different locations , as the first film takes place in a house , the second film takes place in the streets , and the third film takes place in official locations , as well as D.C. , and The First Purge takes place on Staten Island, New York , in which no character from any of the previous installments will be returning.

" Great idea, very poor execution...
",0.1796,-0.9909,2019-03-21 00:00:00,5,"So, we have this amazing plot in mind : the annual purge during election years. On one side, a great hero, the anti-purge senator; On the other side, the bad guy, the pro-purge minister.
Said bad guy remove the rule stating that government officials are immune from the purge, with the intention of killing the anti-purge senator in a perfectly legal way.
Brilliant.
I don't know how this came out to be one of the most inconsistent film I've ever seen tho...
The film start on a high note with an excellent introduction, perfectly depicting the atmosphere that should've been present through and through.
In a very Tarantino-like fashion, it also serve as a way to introduce the senator's character. I loved the fact that it started with the senator's traumatic flash-back first, providing plenty of emotional background for her motivation to stop the purge.Then, for the bigger part of the movie, it all spiralled downward for some reason. As if some of scenes' endings were never written, we're greeted with an awkward, mid-dialogue fade-to-black instead of a proper ending...really? And this goes not once, not twice, but three times in a row! After such a great start, I really can't wrap my mind around this.
Each time after those awkward fade to black comes an ellipse in time taking us closer to the fatal date of the annual purge. However, the rhythm is completely broken by those absurd scene endings - or lack of endings - ruining the whole ""count-down"" feeling.
The dialogues and acting are both quite inconsistent as well, although most of the actors provides a nice performance given how ridiculously loose the script is. Special mention for Betty Gabriel whose performance is absolutely faultless are usual...So, alright, we're left with the bonus-points for social implication. Force once, the white Americans are the bad guys, and the neo-nazis, religious freaks and alt-right members are gonna show their true colours. No holding back on them.
Right? .... Riiiiight.
Not really.
This movie tour-de-force is to play on it's anti-white supremacist social message while depicting some of the worst clich√©s about the anti white supremacists.
So the worst of them all, Neo-nazis cold-blooded killers covered up in nazi tattoos, act as any pro mercenary would do with zero emotional implication. They're depicted as professional, efficient, and politically correct. They are simply ""doing their job""...
Meanwhile, who are the real freaks, you may ask?
Of course : a bunch of black teenage girls. Yes.
Seriously. Oh, and Russians, obviously. Always the Russians and the black teenagers, right?
... I mean, could you get more hypocrite than this?!
It's as if the director wouldn't actually assume the intended message and decided to ""paint the pill in gold"" (as we like to say in France) for those viewers who would be shocked to see pure, white Americans as the bad guys.
The film is littered with clich√©s about afro Americans, despite the fact that a lot of the casting is black, including most of the supportive characters - which I would like to applause heartily, but I somewhat can't, given the ridiculous display of clich√© scenes.
It makes you wonder if the scenario actually want to talk about real problems, or it just surfing a wave of political controversy.Top top if off, there are a number of absurd lines that don't make any sense, making the script even more of a mess.
For instance, the senator calling the exact coordinates of an enemy to her bodyguard; how the hell does she know how to this? She never had a gun in her hands!
Or even worst (spoilers ahead) : after the black gang allies shoot on their friends for absolutely no reasons, wasting countless ammunitions and risking their lives (another great ""blacks are freaks"" clich√©), the nazis mercenaries which are supposed to be gone because their job is done, were in fact waiting in the parking lot.
Why the hell they didn't came over to help their employers and actually have a chance of getting paid - regardless of the convictions nazis are supposed to have - I don't know.
It even get worst but I'm getting discouraged.All in all, a amazing idea sacrificed to literal correctness, a loose script and incredible inconsistency. Even the photography direction weirdly goes from an ethereal glowing style to a crude, gritty action-movie standard look out of nowhere, God knows why.Really sad to see such a great plot being butchered like that. Every ingredients was there to make a great movie : amazing plot, actors, and beginning.
It overall feel like a loose wanna-be Tarantino attempt.
Really disappointing; not worth watching, unless you want to study how a great idea can be ruined by bad editing, script, and not assuming a politically loud, alternative message, badly needed in today's America.
Too bad."
" A timely franchise
",0.0,-0.7579,2019-03-16 00:00:00,6,"Although the producers may or may not have had this in mind when they made the first Purge film back in 2013, the franchise has become a political statement in the age of Obama backlash, modern racism, the Tea Party, and Donald Trump.
In hindsight, the first film was a social commentary (rich white presumably Republicans repressing rage and attempting to lash out at the family headed by Ethan Hawke during the Annual Purge) disguised as a home invasion thriller. The second film ended up being a statement against the NRA-backed military and rich gun nuts (the second half of the film in particular). Now the third movie---a not so thinly veiled Hillary Clinton as the centerpiece.Reviewers giving this movie 1 star and saying things like ""liberal garbage"" must be Rush and Fox Zombies who wrote similar comments about higher profile movies like The Post and Spotlight. Or maybe they're Russian trolls.In any event, this is the weakest of the three films (I have not seen the Final Purge yet). It's rather predictable and poorly acted compared to the other films. Those expecting a Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal fantasy should be looking elsewhere."
" I guess subtlety isn't important
",-0.1511,-0.9839,2019-03-14 00:00:00,3,"This is possibly one of the most ham fisted and forced attempts to make a political movie I have ever seen. The villain is a one dimensional and cliche excuse for an antagonist. He is a stereotypical old, white, rich, and greedy politician who cares about nobody but himself and his other old, white, rich friends. The movie even makes sure you know hes evil by having him hire Nazi mercenaries to kill the protagonist. Why are they Nazis? Because hes evil and conservative that's why. The protagonist is not much better. She is a run of the mill ""strong independent woman who is going to save the day"". She has no character arc and is barely developed throughout the whole movie. The action and presentation of the movie is cartoonish and stupid. Why did those girls cover their car in Christmas lights? Where did they get golden bedazzled AK-47s? Who cares. It looks cool right? All of the purge participants look more like tricker-treaters out on Halloween than scary murderers. The movie then demonizes religion by having a scene where a priest is going to execute a man in front of a crowd and a church. Who's in the crowd? You guessed it: rich white people. I have no issue with subtle political commentary in movies, but his has to be one of the worst attempts I have ever seen. All of this aside, this is a standard suspenseful action movie that brings nothing new to the table at all. All of the characters are forgettable and uninteresting. The cinematography is cookie cutter and all of the action scenes use the good ol' ""shake the camera and cut every .5 seconds and that will make it look cool"" technique. As an suspenseful action movie this film is nothing great. But the horrible attempt at making a smart political movie drags it down even more. This was by far the one if the worst movies I saw in 2016."

The characters were better developed, I thought, and we got a better look into the NFFA and background into why it started and the effect the Purge has had on the lower class.

" Third Purge...
",0.0,0.9931,2019-01-23 00:00:00,5,"""The Purge: Election Year"" is a Thriller - Horror movie and the third movie of ""The Purge"" in which we watch a Former Police Sergeant trying to protect the Senator who is also a Presidential candidate from the purge. Senator is considered a high target due to the fact that she wants to eliminate the Purge, something that every other Presidential candidate uses in order to be elected.Since I had already watched the two previous movies I was expecting something more from it. I believe that it had mostly the same plot as the second movie which was based entirely in the idea of the first movie. Despite that, it still is a nice movie to watch, with an interesting plot and some good interpretations made by its cast. Regarding the direction which was made by James DeMonaco who was also the director of the two previous movies, I believe that he did his best on this movie, he made it reach its potential for one more time but I wanted to watch something better than this. I liked the interpretation of Frank Grillo who played as Leo Barnes and he was very good at it. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Elizabeth Mitchell's who played as Senator Charlie Roan, Betty Gabriel's who played as Laney Rucker and Mykelti Williamson's who played as Joe Dixon.To sum up, I have to say that ""The Purge: Election Year"" is a nice movie to watch, it has a good plot, decent direction, and some interesting interpretations. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I believe that you are going to enjoy it and you are going to be scared too. If you have already watched the two previous movies, I think that you won't be disappointed watching it but you will have the feeling that something was missing from it."

" The Purge goes political
",0.0,0.9562,2018-08-09 00:00:00,5,"Am another person who didn't care at all for 'The Purge' from 2013. It wasn't completely unwatchable with a couple of reasonable performances and decent production values but was so tension and suspense-free and full of irritating characters, illogical character behaviours, a dull pace, a cheesy script and tired clich√©s.Had seen and heard numerous times people saying that 'The Purge: Anarchy' was a much better film. Will admit that due to disliking 'The Purge' so much, part of me was very unsure as to whether to watch 'The Purge: Anarchy' and very nearly didn't watch it. Seeing it, it was indeed a much better film. Decided too to see 'The Purge: Election Year' to see whether the series would continue to improve or whether it would wear thin. Having watched it, 'The Purge: Election Year' is far from great and has major flaws but it was not a bad watch, as far as 'The Purge' films go it is an easy second best, the best being 'Anarchy'.Visually, the slick and gritty look suits the film well and the effects and such are not as sloppy as before. It's ominously and not overbearingly scored and assured enough, while boasting enough, though with much room for more, fun, tension, eeriness and shocks. 'The Purge: Election Year' starts quite well and elaborates upon what happens before and approaches it from a different angle instead of being a re-hash.Frank Grillo is a fully committed lead, although his character was far better written in 'Anarchy'. Elizabeth Mitchell matches him with dignity and professionalism and their chemistry gives some urgency and heart. Mykelti Williamson is good fun. However, the story execution doesn't feel fresh, with tired clich√©s, very variable attempts at twists and too many parts that don't ring true and not always plausible. The character development is still wafer thin, with the villains being ciphers that are not threating and actually being pretty stupid and a few characters don't serve much point. None of the characters are quite as annoying as those in 'The Purge', but the questionable and illogical decision making and behaviours remain still. Dialogue continues to be rather weak, lacking tautness and being awkward and silly, complete with rather heavy-handed and over-emphasised political elements. Would have liked more tension and suspense, while they are here there is not enough of either, and tighter pacing would have helped, the middle act does drag.Overall, not much special but has its moments. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

" Third Purge film worldbuilds, but has the same strengths and weaknesses of it's predecessors
",0.0772,0.8956,2018-08-03 00:00:00,7,"I have real mixed feelings about The Purge films. I've greatly enjoyed each one and am always excited for the next one to come out (I can't wait for the TV series!), but at the same time I've also always found each film a huge disappointment. This third installment does a better job than the previous films of delving more into the social-political context and ramifications of The Purge (an annual 12-hour period where the US government declares all crimes, even murder, legal). The story here is connected to the prior films in that the excellent Frank Grillo is now head of security for a US Senator fighting to end The Purge, who finds herself the night of The Purge being hunted down by The New Founding Fathers of America, the proponents of annual event. Another interesting story element is a former Purger, Betty Gabriel, who now drives a militarized Red Cross ambulance of sorts around the streets during The Purge to help innocent victims, who ends up helping Grillo and the senator. There's also Dwayne ""Dante"" Bishop returning again as a resistance moment leader fighting a Black Panther-like overthrow of The New Founding Fathers. Thematically, the second film did address issues of class and economics, which was lacking in the first film, including storylines about wealthy folks having poor folks pulled off the street to be murdered in the safety of their mansions, with poor folks starting to push back. Election Year continues those class warfare themes, but also brings in politics and how wealthy powerbroker and politicians collude to use The Purge for their own financial benefit, scheming to kill off wide swaths of the poor (really disappointed they didn't use The Dead Kennedys on the soundtrack). Also better than the previous films, writer/director James DeMonaco fills the screen with more memorable images of chaos in the streets. Some of the best are the Lincoln Memorial on fire and vandalized, a group of teen girls cruising around in masks, with guns, in a car covered in Christmas lights, and a then there's a enjoyably throwaway scene of an alleyway pit and the pendulum-like guillotine. DeMonaco also continues to worldbuild, besides introducing politicians debating merits of The Purge, there's ""murder tourists"" coming from other countries to the US to participate in the anarchy. The downside to this third installment is that it felt nowhere as lawless and frightening as the earlier installments. The first film was a more traditional of home invasion horror film, which lent itself to making The Purge something very scary on a small scale, but the two subsequent sequels felt more like action films, which somewhat muted the film's terrifying premiss. Also, these worldbulding elements, although interesting, felt more like throwaway ideas that were just tossed in and never fully explored. It's not bad that they were included in the the film and they certainly add to the world of The Purge, but again, they feel like missed opportunities. Overall, I was never bored by ""The Purge: Election Year"" and was in fact quite entertained, but I still feel like the film should have been scarier, with more horror elements, and although it did delve more into the subtext of the series original premiss, it felt like it was playing things too safe. Maybe the new TV series will be scarier and more incendiary in it's subtext."

" 'The Purge' concept is expanded but the characters and story are still lacking
",0.0,0.9387,2018-07-22 00:00:00,5,"The idea of the purge is far more interesting than the two movies I've seen in the series. I really was disappointed by the first film as I felt it took this interesting larger idea and brought it down to a small home invasion boogeyman horror film. 'Election Year' is a better film than the first Purge movie because it actually explores the dystopian world. It's no surprise that the scenes with the drolly titled new founding fathers are the best and scariest of the film. There's always been a correlation between our societal fears and our horror films and these scenes show a mirror of the ugly kind of climate we live in right now.The thing that sort of disappointed me is that for the most part we don't get much of these villains. The movie for the most part is still a boogeyman chase film. It's a larger spectacle than the first film and with characters who are more likable and well developed but inevitably it gets kind of boring seeing these nameless drones go after our heroes. If the film didn't have leads like Elizabeth Mitchell and Mykelti Williamson I might have tuned out. They treat the material with the utmost sincerity. The successful moments of the film belong to them. It's needed because James DeMonaco isn't that great of a screenwriter. The scenes without the far out philosophical purge commentary play like a bad 'Friday the 13th' clone. DeMonaco is really the factor holding back this film from being really good. He's a mediocre screenwriter who has just enough little sprinkles of intriguing ideas to keep you invested in the midsts of bad dialogue and plot setup. As a director he is a waste. Obviously the purge takes place at night but that doesn't necessitate the film actually being so dark you have trouble seeing what is going on. The action and chase sequences are a cluster of chaos too. You can't tell what the heck is happening.The cleverest commentary sort of falls to the wayside by the end. The film sets up the Purge villains as hypocrites who want to use the chaos to commit genocide on the poor to keep the rich rich. They use religious symbolism to justify it. Brilliant stuff. But to get into spoilers if I may when we finally confront the minister(played by Kyle Secor who gives one of the more effective horror performances in recent memory), it turns out he is actually a fanatic who believes in the purge on that face value religious philosophy. Wouldn't it be more effective if he were the hypocrite the heroes accused him of being?It's a mediocre movie with some truly excellent moments. DeMonaco should let more talented film makers play in his 'Purge' universe."
" The worst of the franchise by far - Pretty Bad
",-0.6597,0.686,2018-07-02 00:00:00,4,"This is where the franchise fails for me. I understand that the director wanted a hopeful ending and show how getting rid of the Purge would play out... but the execution was nothing special. While Purge Anarchy added a lot of really cool aspects to the franchise, this movie doesn't do anything new at all. The cast is pretty forgettable and you don't care much about these characters. Even Frank Grillo's character, which was a badass in Anarchy, is pretty underused in this one. Towards the last third of the movie, I found myself getting annoyed at how linear and uninventive the film was compared to the others. In summary, while Frank Grillo is still doing his thing and there are some decently fun sequences, this is a completely forgettable movie and a step downwards in a franchise that wasn't even good to begin with."

" OK - no more, no less
",-0.1197,-0.489,2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Once a year the USA suspends all laws, including murder, for 12 hours. This keeps down crime and unemployment rates. It also has a disproportionate effect on the poorer classes, and Senator Charlie Roan (who lost her entire family to The Purge when she was a child) is running for President on an anti-Purge platform. But there are those who think such decisions should not be left to the electorate, and Purge Night seems to offer an ideal solution.This third - and possibly last - film in the Purge series follows two primary plotlines. One is Senator Roan's attempts, under the guidance of her security chief Leo Barnes (back from the second film), to avoid being killed, and the other concerns Joe, the proprietor of a small neighbourhood store, who fears that petty thief teenage girls will be back on Purge Night, just when Purge insurance has been priced out of his range. These threads intertwine and tie up with a third concerning an anti-Purge resistance movement.One of the strengths of the Purge series is that it provides a robust scenario within which any number of stories can be told, from the intimate and claustrophobic (a family trying to survive a siege, as in the first film) to this film which addresses wider issues as well as providing some nifty action set pieces.It is fair to note that most of the characters are fairly cliche'd, but they are played nicely (sympathetically by Elizabeth Mitchell as Roan and Mykelti Williamson as Joe), and the story doesn't always go exactly how you expected it to, although the ultimate resolution won't surprise you much.There is a decent amount of fairly violent action and, even though the entire film takes place in the dark, it is relatively easy to follow. Put your brain into neutral, take a mouthful of popcorn on board, and it will pass a couple of hours amiably enough, following which you will forget it completely."

It is blank, it is forced, it is empty, it is nothing new and interesting, it is just a destruction of The Purge idea. This movie is just repeating the concept with some politics involved in the plot and does not deliver in any sort of way. The persons who purge are some wacky stupid teenagers that act and look funny, without a reason to purge, their guns are flashy, their masks are flashy and their hairstyles unic. The movie just loses it's sense and awesomeness that the second sequel managed to develope."
" Predictable, and boring.
",-0.3182,0.4458,2018-04-06 00:00:00,4,"The Purge: Election Year (2016) is the third installment in the ""Purge"" franchise - following The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge. In this film we're reintroduced to Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) who we've seen in The Purge: Anarchy, and Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) who is running for President with one divisive goal in mind: end the Purge once and for all. If you're familiar with The Purge series, you probably know what to expect from this. It has a fairly predictable story with minimal character development and doesn't try to be anything more than mindless action set in nighttime Washington D.C. The themes and tone of the story take a bit of a different turn compared to what we're used to in The Purge series, and attempts to buy a little bit more into the political sphere of the setting with a topical representation of American politics, some of the enemies being a team of white supremacists tasked with taking out opposition by right wing lunatics. This comes off a little heavy handed at some points and otherwise campy, and the villains weren't given any sort of depth besides just making them Nazis. The characters are all very stock and the actors to match. Frank Grillo playing your typical white knight badass while Elizabeth Mitchell plays a genuine politician who's good heart and morals drive them to do nothing but good in the world. The characters only get worse as you look into the other supporting characters, as they're just as boring if not more, with screen time that isn't helping us learn or develop their motivations or backstory. This might be something you're into if you're a big fan of the previous two, but you're going to have to shut your brain off for 2 hours if you want to get any enjoyment out of this film."

When introduced, the movie makes a point of showcasing murder tourists from South Africa. I didn't really think about it at the time, but later in the film, we find out why they were so specifically identified as South African (SPOILER ALERT!-its because they're bad, evil racism-fuled racists! Although when the South Africans are introduced early in the movie, they seem to have at least one Black man in their party)Other than the ""murder tourists"", the film follows standard issue Hollywood formula: Hillary is poised to defeat Donald and end the Purge, which her saintly minority followers all totally grok. Meanwhile, Donald's evil skinhead KKK Nazi followers don't want the Purge to end, so they haphazardly try to kill Hillary. They fail and Hillary is now in a position to overthrow evil Donald's regime. Or is she?!?!?"
" A Below Average Film With Some Redeeming Qualities
",0.0,0.9913,2017-12-16 00:00:00,5,"This is definitely a mediocre film at best, but despite the mostly poor acting and cliche script, I felt the need to actually watch the entire thing. Despite the aforementioned issues, this movie does have some redeeming qualities worth enduring through.The first big issue with ""The Purge: Election Year"" is the writing. The script is filled with cliches, some which were borrowed from the first film (I guess it is a sequel though, to be fair). While there are a few interesting characters, many of them seem very forced. Some unfortunately follow some pretty stereotypical archetypes (the store owner and clerk come to mind here) which end up hindering the overall experience. Beyond character development, the plot often feels pretty ludicrous. The concept of the film is very interesting in my opinion, but the scenarios presented seem contrived. Watch for yourself and see if you agree with me or not. The acting in this movie is decent overall, but many of the lesser roles were terrible. Some scenes were downright cringe worthy. The central cast does a pretty solid job, though, considering the script. I found myself invested in their story arc, even if some of the lesser actors failed to meet the performance of their peers. The primary redeeming qualities of this film seem to revolve around the concept and imagery. For whatever reason, the idea of a ""purge"" is a very creative and interesting concept for a film in my opinion, and the imagery that accompanies this fictional world is very interesting as well. Costumes, special effects and music were all done quite well in ""The Purge: Election Year"", are are a huge reason why this movie doesn't fail completely. Overall, this is a below average film. The concept is unique, but the overall execution leaves much to be desired. There are a few qualities that prevent this film from being downright terrible, but there are many other films I would watch before this one. If you're bored, check it out."

While The Purge is unoriginal lame nonsense, Anarchy is decent action movie and I must admit that third one is good. It's far from greatness, but for an action movie Election Year is even slightly above average, and compared to its predecessors it's far batter.

" Sensible direction, unfortunate execution
",-0.4588,-0.9967,2017-10-15 00:00:00,4,"This should be a disappointment for most fans of the previous two Purge installments, but should not necessarily be avoided.As we watch the characters, familiar and unfamiliar, survive the night, you'll see the expected that all Purge-ians look forward to: violence, death, tension, crazies, drama, scares, and developments in the Purge story. The quality of each however is not all the same. The story and new perspectives is fun, and it makes sense there would be a group and a few individuals fighting against the Purge, and that those running the show of the Purge do not appreciate their efforts. So tensions rise, violence ensues, and morals are tested as usual. It all falls so short of the other two movies though.The biggest issue I had was that the movie tried WAY too hard. The group of rebellious adolescents were extra rebellious, the crazies were obnoxiously crazy, the evil nature of the politicians and religious leaders are beyond the threshold of plausible evilness, the token black role was annoyingly racist, in fact most of the characters and acting was annoying and preachy. Worth viewing once. Especially for Purge fans. That's about it.Hope they up their game for future sequels/prequels."
" Transmutation of horror/action genre into a political satire
",0.0,0.3175,2017-10-14 00:00:00,7,"The Purge series is a horror / action fantasy franchise. It falls in the niche of movies that create a fantasy scenario that makes explicit an otherwise concealed aspect of society. In this regards, the Purge series have always had political undertones. The disparity in society and inter-class issues have been given a strong political face in this third edition of the franchise. The Purge: Election Year is a period drama that is not set in the past of the future, but right here and right now.Viewers who have seen previous editions of the series will immediately recognize the basic premise. There is a familiar face in Election Year who is serving as chief of security of a Presidential candidate.The writing of Election Year could have been better, as the movie is almost too predictable in its narrative of societal issues. Nevertheless, it did manage to engage me for the duration, so it is well paced. The writers also managed to squeeze in Russian hackers, alluding to charges of Russian meddling in US elections, into the midst; see if you can spot where in the movie when you watch it.Issues of race, immigration, consumerism, and unregulated capitalism all make a cameo in the movie.The movie as a whole is a metaphor, but it seems from other reviews, that viewers often try to understand the movie in literal terms, and thereby fail to enjoy the movie as much as they might have otherwise.Since it is a political satire, it is not possible to fairly assume who the protagonists and antagonists are. There is arguably appearance by groups that are reminiscent of KKK and Black Panther as well. It is fairly obvious that this movie was written by people from the Liberal side of the political spectrum and as expected the Conservatives were not cast in a positive light. So you have been warned without giving away any spoilers.While the movie does not break new ground in terms of delivering any profound political idea, it does the job of translating ongoing political situation in US into a horror/action movie fairly well."

Now targeted by those people supporting The Purge, Senator Roan and her head of security, Seargent Barnes, along with some other do-gooders, try to survive the mayhem on Purge Night. The leads were OK, but there were some Really LAME characters. The cheesy, vindictive, teenage girls with chainsaws were ridiculous and mostly just to parade out some scantily dressed eye candy. The rival candidate, preacher, and their followers were reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan and were over the top. The movie was drawn out, had lots of plot holes, characters making stupid moves and was very predictable. Bad script writing was topped off with line after line of extremely unnecessary and extremely foul language in the first 10 minutes. Seriously, if you have no creativity just throw in several lines of foul language and your set, right? Just seemed really forced and took away from what was going on... which was just really bad script writing in general.

" New Founding Fathers of America Part 3
",0.0,-0.9423,2017-10-04 00:00:00,6,"Recap of the first two films in this series: The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) are formed after an economic collapse. The 28th amendment is added. The amendment allows an annual 24 hour period in which no criminal act is illegal and is referred to as ""The Purge."" It is considered a civic duty to participate. During The Purge there is no police or hospital support available. In the second, film the NFFA thinks the poor and the working class should be allowed to remain alive only if they are of use to the wealthy/governing class. Because not enough poor/working class people were being killed in the annual Purge, the NFFA sent out troops to capture and/or kill them.In this film as the other two previous films, multiple stories are going on. It is 18 years after the annual Purge began. Senator Charlene/Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) is running for President of the United States and wants to end The Purge. Her opponent wants The Purge to continue. Charlie's Head of Security is former LAPD Sergent Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo). Grocery store owner Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williams) and his employee Marcos (Joseph Julia Soria) plan to guard the store from Purgers. EMT Laney (Betty Gariel) drives a van in the poor and working class neighborhoods on the night of the Purge helping the innocents caught in the Purge.Be sure to look at the map of the election on the back wall, to see which states are indicated as blue (good guys) and which are red (bad guys).

" The outrageous premise that leads to plausible reactions
",-0.4588,-0.9752,2017-07-03 00:00:00,8,"The first film decently established James DeMonaco's idea of a Purge night, a 12 hour period that permitted all crime, including murder, to be committed to successfully quench some of the nation's darkest desires, causing decreased crime rates for the remainder of the year. It stumbled when Ethan Hawke's protagonist was prematurely and needlessly killed just when the action was reaching exciting heights, ultimately leaving a lingering sting after the credits rolled while failing to add much background to the politically motivated unrest at the core of the narrative.Anarchy (the sequel) improved marginally by expanding the chaos into an open world format instead of confining it to a home invasion sub-genre entry, establishing multiple character story lines which zigzag before crossing while adding more political commentary.Election Year is the strongest segment to The Purge franchise for many reasons. The fundamentals of the plot remain the same as before until all the violence kicks off. And while the premise is too outrageous to be taken seriously - since given the state of this world a frightening event that causes copious bloodshed would never have a hope in hell of being sanctioned ‚Äì a dystopian society governed by totalitarian political parties and economic unrest is worthy enough to be taken as an extended hypothetical if nothing else. Basically, it's serviceable for crowd-pleasing horror/thriller genre fans.The movie follows Frank Grillo's gruff anti-hero again, a flawed person who nevertheless survives by all means, does his job, and saves people he meets long enough to care about by the films conclusion. Lending his skills into security years after his first franchise appearance, he's tasked with protecting a senator whose ideals of stopping the Purge altogether threaten the NFFA (New Founding Fathers of America). Better supporting characters inhabit The Purge world this time, including Mykelti Williamson's good- hearted store owner and his loyal assistant Marcos, as well as Laney, an EMT who bravely patrols Purge night looking to help anyone in dire need of aid or brief protection.Probably Election Years biggest strength is in its pacing. It rarely stops for a breath once the Purge commencement warning loudly sounds throughout the city, and it's only a matter of time before our central characters story lines become imbued with a sense of threat and menace from either corrupt government employees or bloodthirsty hooligans sporting series staple masks of varying creepy designs, and then intertwine before the halfway mark. James DeMonaco captures the horror of the night with some memorably grisly imagery; a nightmare montage replete with blood whilst avoiding degrading into gratuitous overdose.Overall, 'The Purge: Election Year' is a satisfying horror thriller with enough content to appeal to fans. Momentum never falters and there's plenty of good story beats to counteract the premise's unbelievability. Though the sadistic actions taken by the gangs and cults with mad ideologies that aim to eradicate lower class members of society is very much plausible in this current climate. 8/10"
" Purged out
",0.0,-0.9011,2017-07-02 00:00:00,5,"Writer/Director James DeMonaco goes for political satire as well as a dash or horror and violence in The Purge:Election Year.In this movie people have all kinds of novel and sadistic ways to kill people, tortured, hung and guillotined, we even get murder tourism.The present government, The New Founding Fathers have been found out for using the annual Purge violence to get rid of the lower classes, this cuts down on the welfare bill.Controversial presidential candidate Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) is a former survivor of the Purge violence and is running on a ticket to abolish this annual mayhem. Her head of security is Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) who returns from the previous film.Roan and Barnes are on the run as they are betrayed on the night of the Purge and a militia are after them. Barnes needs to keep Roan alive.The duo are helped by Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) as a store owner screwed at the last minute by hikes in his Purge insurance cover and has to stay behind to defend his property with assistant Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria.) They have to fend off a bunch of hacked off teenage shoplifters who are hell bent on a murder spree before Purge Paramedic Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel) makes an impact.An entertaining but uneven film, I think the plot was too thin, just as everyone finds a safe haven, they are out on the run again. It is a case of diminishing returns, the first film in the series was the best. The political satire was a bit heavy handed when it should had been more nuanced."
" Horrible leftist propaganda and a 7.0 from the IMDb Staff???!!
",-0.7666,-0.9139,2017-06-30 00:00:00,1,"I liked the first movie because it was something different. I wasn't quite sure the political message it was trying to convey, but I could tell there was definitely one there. The second movie came along, and it became pretty clear in which direction the franchise was going. After the third, it's almost an out and out attempt to get Hillary elected, as the pro leftist agenda takes center stage. While there is lots of violence and action, the theme is white people are trying to kill minorities and the only hope is to elect a liberal white woman. One of the bad guys even wears a confederate flag patch to make sure we see that the evil guys love the South. It's just so stereotypical, and over the top. Luckily it's so bad that I don't hate this movie as much as others, and simply laugh at it. If the movie had been made a few months later, I am pretty sure the bad guys would have been called The Deplorables, but Hillary's famous phrase had not come out in time I don't think. What sucks more than the leftist propaganda is that there was potential here to do so much more than talk about how unfair America is to minorities and immigrants. It's own message slows the movie down by making sure they stop and yell political statements at each other. The characters don't act realistic, even in this universe. Purging because of a candy bar? After going through hell, you still want to go back out and save a Deli? The bad guys are so over the top, they may as well just made them KKK members.Anyway, just a horrible clich√©d movie, that spews socialist propaganda so much it hurts the movie. So much potential lost. I'm sure Bernie supporters sit around and watch this and think this is what the Trump supporters want to do to America. It's so bad, just laugh it off, don't get mad. But it's hard to not get mad at this. What I don't understand is how this movie got a 7.0 from the IMDb staff. Kinda proves which way IMDb leans, not that we did not know it anyway. Even if you love the message, the movie is just not good. How professional people can give this movie such a high score based on politics and not the quality of it is beyond me. If this is a 7.0 then I need to avoid their recommendations. The staff must be full of Bernie supporters, because even the fans of this movie admit it's not great. I get you like the message, but the movie is on the same level as a Friday the 13th. Just can't see how anyone in the business gives this a 7.0. Fans are different, they are not supposed to be neutral. I voted ALF a 10 because I like it, but I know it's not a ten as far as production. If I was on the staff and reviewing was my job, I would give ALF a much lower score. Maybe they vote the same way and I misunderstood their role in voting. But how anyone gives this a high score I don't know. Just garbage."

",0.0129,0.9899,2017-04-24 00:00:00,5,"I don't really want to rehash the plot in extreme detail but, basically, Charlie Roan is a female senator running for president and she's up against a guy called Earl Danzinger running for the New Founding Fathers of America (N.F.F.A.) party. Charlie has a bit of a sordid past ‚Äì her whole family was killed in front of her on a past purge night 18 years before this movie takes place. They show her giving some fiery speech against the purge, which was full of very common-sense logic. Apparently, she has gained 'too much' support for the N.F.F.A. party ‚Äì who are explicitly behind the purge ‚Äì to feel comfortable about the upcoming election. So, that being said, somehow on this purge, for the first time, politicians are deemed fair game to be killed (in the past they had been exempt). That is the main setup to the story ‚Äì once the purge starts and Charlie is (very expectantly) chased to be killed by N.F.F.A. cronies/mercenaries, she is helped along by Leo Barnes, her head of security. But, I'll be honest - I'm not looking to give a detailed plot in this review, I simply want to give my opinion over some of the plot points and offer my rating. The set-up to the actual purge night is, firstly, completely laughable. We are talking about an American presidential election here ‚Äì one that is, sure, in an alternate universe, but, still, we are talking about a two-party election. To have the N.F.F.A. party simply decide to lift the politician exemption for THIS singular purge is ludicrous. Apparently, we are expected to believe that this party has always won by landslides in the past, or else competing candidates would have essentially always been gunned down on purge nights for getting the opposition too close to actual political power. Secondly, this film has a very odd sub-plot ‚Äì that of the deli owner with his immigrant laborer by his side who is defending his deli from¬Öa few teenage girls with toy guns and (somehow) extremely professional cutting saws to get into the deli. I get that movies can sometimes utilize somewhat absurd sub-plots to propel along the main action but it seems like the whole point of this subplot is to showcase an immigrant worker ‚Äì who seems to be the closest embodiment of purity that we get in this movie ‚Äì just trying to help out his boss. It may seem like I'm reading into the director's thoughts (this movie was written and directed by the same person) a little bit with that comment but this movie has very clear racial overtones. Not only is the whole N.F.F.A. party shown to be European white in a number of scenes but the whole resistance operation against the purge is led by African- American guys (who have little to no backstory) and, bizarrely, Crip gang members. To top it off, the female senator is chased by a group of mercenaries who sport Nazi symbols on their uniforms ‚Äì the sergeant/leader even sports a Confederate flag proudly on his shoulder. Thirdly and on a different note, there actually is very little gore in this film. For a setting in which murder is legal for a day, well, there are maybe a total of 4-5 scenes in which actual killing is going on or happened recently. Although the plot is appreciated in principle for a movie like this, honestly, after a certain point, I think this movie would've really benefited from going all out with the blood and guts. After the first 30-45 minutes, this movie essentially becomes an action thriller in which Charlie Roan is being chased by her enemies. Not to mention, the character of Earl Danzinger is criminally underdeveloped. Although he is the presidential candidate for the N.F.F.A. party and is more or less the primary antagonist, I couldn't even remember this character's name until I looked up the name on the cast list. Add in to this that, although Charlie Roan is, on the opposite end, a pretty fleshed out character, still, she's, well, kind of an idiot. The whole pretense of her getting chased through the night and being helped by her security guard is predicated on her stupidity on the actual night of the purge. She decides that it's 'noble' to just stay at her regular old house to wait out the purge with his security detail on hand, which only amounts to a few guards in an open suburb. Even when she's been chased for her life for more than half the film, she insists that the resistance movement she finds NOT go after the N.F.F.A. political party leaders, who are holding some sort of covenant in a Washington D.C. church. Why not? She thinks it isn't the right thing to do ‚Äì this coming from a person whose whole family was killed because of the purge and who herself is running from a squad of professional killers right then and there. I do think this movie has some redeemable qualities, and it was overall well made, but there are too many plot flaws to overlook for the watchful eye. Add in to this the unnecessary politicization of race in a summer-horror franchise and it's difficult to get lost in the story. The writer/director needs to learn some subtlety in this regard. Also, in comparison to the first film ‚Äì which was basically a home- invasion story set around the plot of a purge occurring everywhere ‚Äì it seems like there should be some lengthy sequences here showing, well, purging. The characters here are moving out in the open on the actual night of the purge and still we - the audience - are only offered GLIMPSES of what's going on out there."
" Wow! Hitler would be proud!
",0.8168,-0.9946,2017-04-07 00:00:00,4,"I activated my account just to be able to comment on this movie. This movie was at the very most tolerable because I had to try to get my few dollars worth on the rental. This was a very open and hateful racial attack against whites. I am not white, but if I was, I would be protesting somehow and not putting a penny into the pockets of the people who made this. If this movie had targeted any other racial group, there would be rioting and protests by these groups. It would be called a 'hateful' propaganda movie. Hitler would be proud because the spirit behind Hitler was 'hatred for another group' and not necessarily the group targeted. Racism and hatred from any group should not be tolerated. History shows us that some of the worst oppressors were oppressed at one point. To hang on to the hatred of the past will only cause future chaos and suffering. It will come. Maybe not a purge, but judgment will come."
" Worth the watch if you liked Anarchy. Not as good, but still something here.
",0.1648,0.9684,2017-04-02 00:00:00,6,"For the third installment of the series, writer/director James DeMonaco brings us another unworldly view on the future of American society. 18 years after add night of terrible events, Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) is in the midst of running for president against quite the candidate, Earl Danzinger (Kyle Secor), whom is an acting minister and backed by the New Founding Fathers of America (who are in charge of the purge, itself). One of the only things making the senator vulnerable is the new rule that eliminates the protection of all government officials from the purge, therefore making her an easier target. However, our senator is certainly not alone. By her side is Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) from the previous entry of the series, Anarchy. Leo reprises his role as the bad ass he was before, ensuring nothing happens to Charlie on this fateful and hectic night.Getting tied up in the antics is a convenience store owner Joe Dixon (a very funny Mykelti Williamson) who can't afford ""purge insurance"", his employee Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria), and a couple of friends who cruise the streets in search of people who may need their assistance. Pretty brave of them, huh? These characters understand what the purge is about (aside from ""releasing the beast""): removing lower class individuals and minorities so the government spends less caring for their essential needs. It's true, and we learned this from the previous installment. All this does is add fuel to the fire for our team of misfit anti-purgers.What I really liked about this film (and Anarchy) is that they explored all of the twisted possibilities of purge night. Election Year went into further detail to bring us more corrupt politicians, a plethora of psychos (decked out in practically anything patriotic you could ever think of), and most notably, European and foreign citizens boarding flights to America so they can ""purge"" and ""cleanse"" themselves. Nothing can interfere with Leo and the help of his crew. Whether that's white supremacists or the frantic nature of common purgers, they have the power, intelligence, and artillery to handle whatever crosses their path.You're not going to find a stellar script, or even acting for that matter. However, I can assure you that these two things do not take away from your viewing experience. Frank Grillo is designed to carry a film like this, and with the support and comedic relief of a few others, this film doesn't drag for a minute. Sure, there are some events and story pieces that must be set up and approached rather meticulously, but once it gets going, there is no stopping the next twelve hours of madness that are about to ensue. I ended up enjoying the last 20 minutes or so of this film much more than I had anticipated.It's taken me a while to get over how much of a flop the first installment was, but with this new addition to the franchise, I strongly feel that DeMonaco is taking the idea of the purge in the direction it should've went in the first place. We are making progress, but I'd certainly be interested in seeing some purge ideas that didn't focus solely on death, rather, other various forms of illegal activity. Until then, Election Year will make another fine addition to the collection of purge fans. Rejoice once more in the spilled blood of Americans, and go buy or rent The Purge: Election Year today."

" Third time isn't lucky for this frustrating series
",-0.6407,0.7172,2017-03-19 00:00:00,2,"A continuation of the frustrations that began with the Purge series first few entries, Election Year is but another half-baked (at best) dosage of barely there thrills and non-existent chills and not even the biggest fans of the Purge films are likely to be finding themselves fans of this cheap and lacklustre experience.Bringing back Purge: Anarchy's main character Leo Barnes as played by Frank Grillo, Election Year tries its hardest to set about a flow on from the second entry but surrounded by vicious, yet un-affecting bursts of violence, cookie cutter characters that we can't even be bothered caring about and a cast of B grade supporters like Elizabeth Mitchell and Mykelti Williamson, James DeMonaco's (who seemingly only cares about making these movies) film fails to ignite any type of spark, which is the main reason this franchise has become a disappointment for the third time running.When The Purge arrived in cinemas around the world in 2013 it was promoted off the back of an idea in which America, once a year for 12 hours can commit any form of crime they like without the possibility of punishment, what we got instead was Ethan Hawke stuck inside his house as a boring home invasion thriller took place while the 2014 follow up Anarchy at least ventured outside, it too seemed like a poor way to use a potent idea, ripe for both horror and thriller elements to combine into one.It was wishful thinking, but I for one was hoping it'd be third time lucky for this franchise but Election Year gives us very little bang for our buck, even the films nice addition of being held around the election period in the United States is wasted as we watch Williamson's Joe Dixon protect his beloved convenient store or Frank Grillo's Barnes determinedly going about protecting Elizabeth Mitchell's potential presidential candidate Charlie Roan, but we're given no real horror, no real satire and at the end of the day this TV quality movie could finally be the end to a franchise that could've been something.Horror fans need not experience this new purging and for those like me that have failed to enjoy any of the previous instalments in this low budget yet successful series, Purge: Election Year is more of the same and that is absolutely not a good thing.1 explosive suitcase out of 5"
" Not as good as the first, but still pretty good
",0.125,0.9958,2017-03-14 00:00:00,7,"The Purge: Election Year (2016) is the third installment in the Purge film franchise. In my opinion the first purge film was better/more entertaining than this one, but I did not dislike this movie, there were many things in it that worked well. One of those things that in my opinion worked, was the casting. I thought Elizabeth Mitchell was a great choice to play Senator Charlie Roan, seemed very fitting for the starring role of the senator running for president who years ago witnessed the slaughtering of her family, and wants to eradicate the purge night. I also really enjoyed the characters. Joe was such a great respectable character, I thought the actor who plays him did a great job and it was awesome to see an older brave wise man here that's willing to fight for the doing away with of the horrific night. The writing is not all that strong to be honest, but there still are moments of sentimental dialogue between characters who are close and share connections, that's nice to see in this kind of a film, showing that it's not all just about gore. The killings shown are sometimes pretty graphic, so be prepared for that. Although the main thing in this film is Senator Roan and her guard escaping to safety and running from enemies with the help of friends. I'd suggest it as a decent horror movie, not the best, but it's got its definite good aspects. 7/10."
" Wonderful piece. Full of action and suspense
",0.5719,0.9881,2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"First of all, I would like to say that I have watched all 3 parts of the The Purge. The first part began the concept of the Purge and, hence, it was a pretty good movie. What made it stand out from the next two movies (and this is how it probably should be) is that it focused on normal people fighting for survival. The second part shifted from this a bit and we got a 'hero' type of protagonist named Leo, who is also the a main figure in this latest sequel. The issue is with such a character is that it becomes more of an action movie. The second part was, therefore, not that enjoyable comparatively.This new addition to the franchise, though, corrects some of the mistakes of the first sequel. Leo's job now is to protect a senator who wants to end the Purge. Due to her stance, she obviously is an important target for the opposition. Surviving against the advanced weaponry of government forces adds some intense flavour to the movie, and, on top of that, they also have to be cautious of the other purgers. We also get to meet other important characters, all of whom have a great role to play in the movie. One's a shop owner, and the two are his friends. It makes a good watch, because the chemistry between all of them is pretty good.Somewhere along the way, all these characters cross each other and aid each other in survival. One thing that I liked in this movie, which was absent in the previous part, is that Leo is much less like a 'hero' now. He isn't as flawless, and often it is the other characters who get the job done. Another thing that I really found nice was the innovative ideas in purging, and in the way purging can be used for personal gains.All in all, a solid movie."

" Not Enjoyable
",-0.3412,-0.6929,2017-02-19 00:00:00,2,"I watched this movie because I saw the first in the series and thought it was a kind of fun movie. This one had a similar rating so I figured it was an obvious pick.It's horrible though, you'll be too busy rolling your eyes or face-palming, so you can't enjoy the few good scenes laid far between.What's amazing, is the filler of this movie, is 2 parts political propaganda undertones (which make it very easy to identify what's happening next), with 2 parts simultaneously having heavy racial stereotypes of the characters. And 1 part you not caring for any of the characters because they're irrational. Even a ""brilliant"" one making awful decisions because they couldn't figure out how else to lead the plot in that direction.If you liked the first, maybe try the second movie, but leave it at that, because this ruins it."

The twist here is that a new presidential hopeful wants to ban the practice as it is really just a cull on poor people.By now there is a danger the writers would have run out of clever ideas. Well I don't think they have. There are some interesting themes like Murder Tourism and the weapons of the elite being used against them.However, this film is so badly executed on such a restricted budget it is hard to watch.All of the good ideas are wasted on monumentally badly thought out set pieces. It loses any sense of realism, and therefore tension, as we see guillotines set up in arty lit side alleys.Here are the scary murder tourists what are these guys going to do? Draw their knives and run at a load of guys with guns. What was the point?The violence is boring, the affects and lighting poor, the acting average, the story falls flat.Just give this a miss, even if you love the franchise - there really is nothing to see here."

The second one became a road movie of sorts with many different protagonists/characters who we followed. So while Part 3 has the initial idea of Part 1, it does more resemblance with Part 2 (and takes over a character too).It's still entertaining (hopefully I don't have to remind anybody that this is a movie and I'm not talking about this becoming reality), though while there is an urgent matter at hand, it feels like many pieces, that sometimes just not fit to each other. The ideas behind certain things are pretty clear, but don't translate as good as they could. But while it tries to appease to your mind too, this is very violent too. Also brings out the worst in certain people who don't seem to have any shred of decency in their body (you could call that clich√©) ... at least it doesn't pull any punches.

" It's Just A Movie, Folks.
",0.0,0.8278,2017-01-24 00:00:00,5,"I've read some of the reviews of this film on this site and others and I have to tell you, I have never seen an action film become such a political debate with so much whining! It seems like all I read was Hillary Clinton this and Hillary Clinton that and that this film is liberal propaganda and that white conservatives are the enemy while minorities or ""brown people"", as one reviewer put it, are the heroes, I mean all the whining got so annoying! I mean it's not that serious, it's just a freaking movie, but if they want to get into some political discussion on it, O.K. Since the beginning of cinema Blacks, Native Americans and other groups have been made the enemy or negatively type-cast or stereotyped in films but when some of these reviewers think that the white man is being portrayed as the enemy they want to whine and complain about it. All I can tell them is welcome to the club, now they know how it feels but like I said before, it's just a freaking movie, then on top of that, the heroes of this film were men, women, white, black, and Hispanic all working together, not to mention some of the bad guys in this film were black females! Again, it's just a freaking movie! I can see if this same formula was constantly being put out in films all of the time and then something is said about it but it's not put out like that all of the time. I mean, can't we all just get along and enjoy an action film?Anyway, ""The Purge: Election Year"" is an O.K. action film. It's not as good as the original but about as good as the second installment. The first Purge film was a great idea that had a pretty good story-line and plot but by the time ""The Purge: Anarchy"" and ""The Purge: Election Year"" came around the idea became a bit redundant. What I did like about this film is the fact that characters from the first two installments of the franchise appeared in this film. For being so far-fetched, that gave this film some sense of stability and reality. If you really enjoyed the first Purge this one, like the second, might let you down just a little but it's nothing you'll regret after seeing it."
" I'll vote for 'The Purge: Election Year'!
",0.0,-0.1816,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Are you ready to cleanse your sins away and 'Purge' once again? Well, the movie industry certainly is with 'The Purge: Election Year'. Funny, it is an election year in the real world and with Donald Trump on the card, an actual 'Purge' might just happen. You might laugh at that notion and I do too, but it's more plausible than ever before. Writer/director of all 'The Purge' movies, James DeMonaco, actually got his start as the writer of the Robin Williams' film 'JACK', which if you look at it closely, they are all practically the same movie. Of course, I'm kidding.These 'Purge' films have certainly grown into a political and social satire on our society today, where the 1st 'Purge' film basically just centered on a family, trying to survive the 12 hour 'Purge', where all crime, including murder is legal. It was a home invasion film at its core with a hint of a political message of how the wealthiest 1% are purging on the lower income and minorities in America. It was hinted at only. 'Purge: Anarchy' took to the streets of the big city and got bigger into the political and social messages with an actual militia full of people, trying to stop 'The Purge' by taking out the government.The political messages were rampant, but focused on a guy named Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), as he tried saving people through the night, in order to kill someone from his past. Cut to two years later and we are at 'The Purge: Election Year', where a Donald Trump like figure is in office who is very much for murdering and ""purging"" in this twelve hour period. On the other side of the fence is US Senator Charlene Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell from 'LOST'), and is running for President and is deeply opposed to the annual 'Purge'.Her first order of business and biggest issue is getting rid of the 'Purge', due to an incident that happened fifteen years prior. Leo Barnes is now in the secret service business and is in charge of protecting Roan, but the government does not want her in office so they can keep purging year after year, and this they try and kill her. Leo and Charlene are no running thru the streets, trying to survive the night with the help of a deli owner named Joe (Michael Williamson or Bubba from 'Forest Gump') and a couple of his friends.There are definitely a lot of moments that are eerily similar to the current election coming up in November, but DeMonaco does a good job at keeping things thrilling and darkly funny throughout. Characters who ""purge"" are over-the-top and ridiculous for sure, and their anger and crudeness is unbelievable, but the reward is so satisfying when they get their comeuppance. There is a ton of political talk throughout with some gruesome murders and some fairly scary and sadistic images that DeMonaco has conjured up. It's a frightening scenario for sure and DeMonaco succeeds in showing the horror around DC, which is actually the streets of Rhode Island.The dialogue is blunt and vulgar, but at times can be silly and quite funny to lighten the mood. Frank Grillo more or less takes a back seat this time around too and while he has a couple of quick fight scenes, he isn't the complete badass that we saw in the last film. I'm sure they will keep making 'Purge' films as long as they are making money, so I expect a fourth installment in the next year or two. 'The Purge: Election Year' does a good job for what it is and continues the story and its political message in these current times. The film is entertaining enough and for fans of the other 'Purge' films will certainly like this third sequel.RECOMMENDED FOR FANS!"
" Just like the previous movies! 4/10
",0.4199,0.9927,2017-01-07 00:00:00,4,"Review: With the amount of money that this franchise has made, they really need to hire some better actors and script writers because this film looked cheap and amateur. Like the previous movies in this franchise, this movie is based on Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), who is now protecting Senator Charlie Roan, (Elizabeth Mitchell), who is running for presidency and totally against the Purge. Also, Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) is adamant about protecting his deli store during the Purge, with his fellow worker Marcos (J.J. Soria), and Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel) who fights against the baddies while the Purge is active. During the Election Year, the new rules for this year's Purge is that government figures will not be protected, so Senator Charlie's life is at risk because there is a chance that she can win the presidency, which will go against the rich electors who want to keep the Purge alive. With Leo risking his life to protect Charlie, he turns to Joe for help after being caught in an impossible situation. They then go into hiding, with the help of some radical protesters who want to take down the rich electors, so Senator Charlie can become president, which will put a stop to the Purge. The only problem is that Charlie wants to win the election fairly, so she tries to stop the radicals from killing the rich government members, until she becomes kidnapped by the evil doers. Its full of intensity throughout and there are some gruesome scenes but it still felt like it needed some top actors. The whole Purge concept is original, and I can understand why it's a hit with movie goers but Frank Grillo is better in a cameo role, than the lead. With that aside, I did find the movie entertaining and I enjoyed the fight scene towards the end but I was expecting more from this third movie. If they decide to make a fourth film, they really need to take the Purge to another level. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was written and directed by James DeMonaco, who brought you the previous Purge movies and Staten Island starring Ethan Hawke and Vincent D'Onofrio. With Michael Bay in the production chair, James had the opportunity to push this franchise to the big league but he chose to stay safe by making a film, which is very close to the previous Purge films. Personally, I wasn't a big fan of the franchise because it all seemed a bit ""Escape From New York"" to me but it's obviously popular with certain audiences, judging by the profit at the box office. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch but it's just not my cup of tea.Budget: $10million Worldwide Gross: $118.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/horrors, starring Frank Grillo, Elizabeth Mitchell, Mykelti Williamson, J.J. Soria, Betty Gabriel, Terry Service and Edwin Hodge. 4/10"
