" Nice insight into Nina Simone
",0.4215,0.9969,2020-09-04 00:00:00,8,"""As I got older, I started to look at her and I thought to myself, 'Wow, she's from another time!' But she was not at odds with the time. Time was at odds with her. I think when a person moves to their own kind of clock, spirit, flow .... if we were living in an environment that allowed us to be exactly who we are, you're always in congress with yourself. The challenge is, how do we fit in in the world that we're around? Are we allowed to be exactly who we are? Was Nina Simone allowed to be exactly who she was? As fragile as she was strong, as vulnerable as she was dynamic, she was African royalty. How does royalty stomp around in the mud and still walk with grace? Most people are afraid to be as honest as she lived."" -- Ambassador ShabazzA documentary that gives a fairly complete picture of Nina Simone's life, covering a fascinating woman who was a piano prodigy, brilliant musician, abused wife, civil rights activist, and someone who struggled with mental health issues. I love how it didn't shy away from her pretty radical political positions or the painful realities of her personal life, while at the same time, let us see her perform, showing her musical genius and stage presence. I felt real power in songs like ""Mississippi Goddam,"" and felt Simone's place in the history of a struggle which persists to this day. I think she's appreciated, but at the same time, somewhat underrated, either because of her appearance or her outspoken views, and the film might help rectify this.At the same time, I thought it fell a little short in not staying just a teeny bit longer on her triumphant music in the mid-1960's, e.g. from albums like ""I Put a Spell on You"" (1965), moving too quickly to her breakdown and withdrawal for my taste (and then spending too long there). To not play songs like ""Take Care of Business"" or ""Break Down and Let It All Out"" at all (naming just a couple), and to talk over most of ""Love Me or Leave Me,"" but to show extended clips of her later (often awkward) performances instead I think did her a disservice. Maybe it needed to be longer, or have its focus tuned a bit. Also, I didn't like how her husband, a guy who often beat the hell out of her, was allowed so much time via an old interview clip. Overall I liked watching it though, and adore this artist."
" Good Bio of a Cultural Phenom

" Essential Viewing.

Miss Simone's words and they resonate more profoundly then ever.The documentary was meaningful and sad and beautiful and tragic and 100% necessary.There's a point in the film where someone close to her says that everyone has the same experience when they hear Nina Simone for the first time. When you hear her the second time, you know exactly who it is. (paraphrased)This documentary has been in my watchlist for over a year, and I knew it was going to be emotional... but now, more than ever, seemed like the perfect time to take it in and learn more about her life. And in doing so, you come to understand that she lived a life that had so much purpose and intent.Of all the interviews in the movie, I found the ones with Malcom X's daughter, Attallah Shabazz to be the most interesting:

" Extraordinary talent, fascinating film, Mississippi Goddam
",0.4215,0.9638,2020-06-09 00:00:00,10,"This remarkable documentary about jazz great, civil rights auteur, brilliant, original musician, Nina Simone, explores her roots and route from being born Eunice Waymon in North Carolina, (1933 the Jim Crow era), to taking the musical scene and world of raw, unfettered activism by the goddams and blending them into a pallet beyond compare.Hoah! And I thought the Amy Winehouse bio was captivating and difficult to watch.What Happened, Miss Simone? is a bold, fierce piece fitting of the Patron Saint of the Rebellion, who trained to be the first black female classical pianist and dreamt of performing at Carnegie Hall. At her first recital, her parents were told to stand in the back because they were black. Little Eunice had none of that, and they were seated in the front row.Nina's peformances, naturally, are extraordinary, more so as they are woven within the context of her life story. Her rendition of 'Mississippi Goddam' is a highlight in this film, punched up by the well presented history of the 1960s civil rights movement. Nina made clear she was not non-violent, and was interested in achieving freedom and justice no matter what it took. Her rage was channeled into her music; she sang and played with passion to change this wild world.Nina's daughter Lisa, (grounded, articulate, and empathetic), serves as one of our guides through Nina's life. Lisa's admiration for her mother's genius, hard work, courage, and sacrifice mingle with her painful recollections of being abandoned by her. After beatings by her husband, losing audiences because of her fierce devotion to singing only political songs, and erratic behavior of highs and lows, (later labeled bi-polar disorder), Nina left her young daughter and everything behind to seek liberty in Liberia.The description of the bad effects of the psych medication Nina was put on were disturbing.Nina was turned away from applying to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia due to racism; later and in her life, the Institute gave her an honorary degree."
" ""What does it mean to be free?"" ""No fear!""
",-0.3595,0.8126,2019-07-22 00:00:00,10,"It feels like a sharp slap to the face, seeing a black woman use her music, her fierceness and her incalable voice to denounce the violences black folks went through in America while remaining bold and fiery at the face of racism and sexism. Nina was more than a musical genius, with her perfect classical piano training and her deep baritone voice; Nina was a warrior, a true inspiration for black women all around the world to take the places in which their presence isn't tolerated.
This documentary perfectly shows the nuances of her being - the boldness, the talent, the conflict, the pain - and it perfectly makes you understand a lot more about Nina not only as an artist, but also as a human being."
" The Defamation of Nina Simone.
",0.0,0.9954,2019-04-15 00:00:00,1,"I was shocked by ""What Happened, Miss Simone."" I loved Nina when I was much younger, I saved up my pittance of an allowance to buy her long playing vinyl record albums.
I'm not denying anything in the documentary, it probably all happened, but I think the program concentrated too much on the negative, not enough on what made Nina great in the first place.
I don't think she got a fair shake from Netflix. She's long dead, she can't defend herself, she can't speak for herself. Sure, she was troubled. But she was also a major talent, I choose to remember the talent. This program came across like a black version of ""Mommie Dearest,"" or ""Let's get Nina.""
Her daughter, her husband, everyone trashed her memory.
Her daughter has every right to speak her mind, tell her side of the story, of course.
But like Christina Crawford, her memories are those a child, and children often resent adult decisions a parent has to make, compromises adults must make to navigate rough seas.
Nina's voice reflected her suffering, her suffering as a woman in a man's world, as a black person in a white person's world. She never saw the light at the end of the tunnel. She was consumed by racism, and sexism.
She seemed even to hate her fans, the basis of her support. The foundation of her financial security.
Simone always felt like an outsider in her own country. So much so that she moved to the Republic of Liberia in West Africa, the nation founded by freed slaves from the United States, primarily from what were at one time the Confederate States of the deep south.
Critics are lambasting a coming dramatization of Nina's life because her male love interest in the movie was actually gay, so how could he be the love of her life?
Hey, it's a movie, not a documentary.
Billy Dee Williams played Billie Holiday's love interest in Lady Sings The Blues, a completely fictional character, but a handsome male lead made the movie much more interesting, it made Lady Sings the Blues a love story. That's what Hollywood does best."
" SMASHING GRITTY
",0.0,-0.5023,2019-01-24 00:00:00,9,"You know people goes through thing, but when a person just stops what they are doing and disappears, that's scary. The film explained is ALL. Excellent"
" The Director Has Surely Taken The Easy Way Out!
",0.7263,-0.9318,2017-09-09 00:00:00,10,"Why wait till the end of the movie to finally suggest that the reason why Nina Simone was unhappy was because she was bipolar, then maybe we can follow through the entire movie knowing that we're just looking at a crazy woman! I'm confused is she the one to blame for the beatings she took from her husband, for living in a time of racism where it was not even permitted to discuss trauma, for being turned down to go to a school because she was African-American; only to be acknowledged after her death,for her political involvement with civil rights movement, which has always been considered taboo, for being poor, for living in fear of a lynching, for not being permitted to be a mother - just for living in fear! Hey! While you're at it, you can just write her out of the movie all together and just say this is how you become bipolar! This is what happens to women when they are given too much responsibility! We love that story! She can't take care of herself. As long as the men took care of the bills, she couldn't possibly understand the bills. Even in her final moments, she is not heard. It all falls on deaf ears Nina! They're not listening! They can't hear you! They gave you the pills so you could just keep playing! It's three strikes and you're out - African-American, woman, mental illness! I can't imagine a place anywhere and in anytime that a woman like this was not spotted on the street and cared for? Was that the state of mind during the civil rights movement? Can you answer me that question? You are telling me not one person, not a friend,family, or fan came to take care of her? I mean manic-depression has been around quite a long time! Centuries! There has always been people who have it and have been around to treat it. It didn't just happen in the last ten years! I'm sick of the big finale of bipolarism/mental illness! Why not do what has always been done when a writer/director doesn't know how to end a story - just staple a deuce ex machine to it and call it a day! Perfect rags to riches story, hey? Why even mention a mental illness? So those of us who suffer can say, well that's why we'll never be an important part of society! Or those of us who don't suffer as much can button it with, oh thank heavens she got help! Maybe a better ending might be triumphant? The husband is put in jail, finally justice served! By the way, since we are airing out the dirty laundry, what about the husband? What was his mental illness diagnosis? That he was a man and times were different? He gets a pass? The daughter? Anyone with the correct information knows that it runs in the family. How about tieing things up with a prompting of intolerance? Or don't women, African-American and those suffering with mental illness deserve some tolerance? And don't think I didn't miss that you are quick to label an abused woman as bipolar, which is why I asked the question at the beginning. Isn't this what the movie was about? Creating more intolerance! That is why they smacked the mental illness label onto Nina and the ending of the movie: so we could all feel like we were in the same company with the intolerant, nice and cosy. It is a mirror of our intolerance. It's just an easier explanation than and less taboo to just say she lost her fame because of bipolarism and easier to diagnose as she is a woman. Whatever, bravo to the director for an ignorant message! I loved seeing the original footage, but the the director should be cremated! Nina you're not alone. You were never alone. We women are all still dieing silently - African-American, or pathetically diagnosed with a mental illness - for all our tries."
