" A waste of acting talent
",0.0,0.6007,2021-04-08 00:00:00,2,"I'm shocked at how bad this film is. There is no real plot. Keane Reeves drifts from one crime scene to the next with the flimsiest of links but says little. The two main characters, his and the protagonist played by Ana de Armas only meet in the final 5 minutes. The plot resolves itself without any seeming link to the storyline and the big reveal comes out of nowhere. It has no link to any of the plot strands. Who were the strange figures? Why did they follow her? We'll never know. Then the credits roll. The direction is non existent and I actually feel robbed of almost two hours of my life. The only saving grace is Ana de Armas who puts in a fine acting performance."
" Haunting in more ways than one
",-0.2732,-0.9952,2021-03-31 00:00:00,9,"Maybe I've got it wrong. It's possible all the dreadful reviews are spot on. I might be filling in blanks that don't exist. All I'm certain of is that this was one of the most haunting films I've seen in a decade. I've had difficulty putting it out of my mind, and have had conversations with my wife about it; not something that comes after Star Wars.I came away thinking that the film is about trauma. There's a victim of serial child abuse from a father, and who tragically is raped as an adult and a little later loses her husband when he is killed in a nonsensical war.We have the wife of a police officer who dies on duty. We have his 'partner', i.e. Colleague, who is fighting the death of his wife and is conflicted by the fact that his partner was corrupt.So we have mental conflict, trauma, abuse, death and loss. It's not a life-affirming film.The victim is thrown out from the committed Catholic family of her husband, who pray all the time, but when she tells the she is, in her mind, miraculously pregnant, they don't believe and she's not believed, and forced to return to her parents, including the abusive father. It doesn't end well.The police officer, Reeves, is falling apart in front of our eyes as he struggles to act responsibly and in accordance with his oath, despite no one else caring. The victim becomes his focus as he knows there's a connection between her and his partner. It doesn't turn out to be as he expected.The victim of the abuse/rape is in denial; it's a way of coping, but not a sensible one as it eats away at her, consuming her in the way the ring does its bearer in the Ring trilogy. In Exposed, we fear that the woman will fall apart. The struggle she has to cope ties the story together.Anyone who has had anything to do with victims of traumatic crimes or incidents might well interpret the film as I do. It's so clear to me.It's a horror story, all the more terrible as it happens often. It should haunt all those who see it."
" Maybe watch it again?
",0.0,-0.8225,2021-03-06 00:00:00,9,"I understand this movie had its problems, try putting that to one side maybe and digging below the surface to a part of the storyline.Ana de Armas is stunning. Reading through the plot after watching this movie, I decided to watch it again. Parts of this storyline entice you in and when the penny dropped as to what had happened, it had the same effect on me as The Sixth Sense. Thought provoking, tragic and sadly all too familiar to cases in real life.Put the criticisms aside and give this a try."
" Ana De Armas is a ten, but this film is a weak five
",-0.5927,0.2159,2021-03-04 00:00:00,5,"Off-beat film to say the least. If it wasn't for the beautiful and talented Miss De Armas, the movie would be a real disappointment. Down beat movie with little to feel good about. Enough said. If you are a fan of Reeves or De Armas see it only for that. If not, forget it."
" Insipid mess - but stand out Ana de Armas performance
",-0.4118,0.9487,2021-02-21 00:00:00,4,"I would want to add in this review to encourage to watch what, acknowledged, is otherwise now a mess, if only for a top performance in a difficult role for the much under-appreciated gorgeous Ana de Armas.First up, noting that there are 33 producers credited (yup, you read that right: THIRTY THREE all vying for ...) here should immediately warn you, you are likely in for a mess:Although, actually, this is not quite so, for hiding - certainly NOT 'exposed' - can be discerned what was probably originally a quite clever, intriguing and certainly most disturbing screenplay (by the director, Gee Malik Linton: but note, he had his name changed to a 'D. Dale = clearly, red flag warning number two!): note, it's current title is more or less meaningless, but his original title more or less gives the game away as it is when the final denouement plays out, you'll highly likely be left with trying to think / work out, did it really all fit together (No it didn't!):Most unfortunately, with the addition of Reeves, the producers, scriptwriters - or someone* - moved the focus to him, but he has no palpable character arc; if not his - alleged - wooden acting style, then clearly on display is simply evidence of just how adrift he found himself in this not quite held together, not mess, but half cocked effort. Even Mira Sorvino is sorely underused in a what surely should have a been a pivotal part to the plot Linton originally set out, but here is unforgivably reduced just to a throwaway tryst role for Reeves. Pity, for the gorgeous Ana de Armas - (the reason I ran across it) - not only otherwise carries the whole 'mystery', but gives a fabulous, convincing performance as the wronged / mistreated ingénue to keep your eye on: when it all comes out (!) what is going on with her, she puts in a truly painful, difficult to watch portrayal (á la 'Irreversible' like.)
One to watch to think what could have been if not interfered with by the filmdom powers that control! ** See the Trivia notes: seems, blame 'Lionsgate Premiere' for the travesty.
N.B. Armas (especially) and Reeves are far (far!) better in 'Knock Knock'= go see."
" Terrible
",-0.4767,-0.5413,2021-01-25 00:00:00,1,Too long of a movie for something so lacking in plot. I had to fast forward to the end to see if my plot prediction was correct. It was. So disappointing.
" Horrible movie
",-0.5423,-0.5849,2021-01-09 00:00:00,1,Probably one of the most horrible movies than I have seen in the last years.
" An odd choice for Keanu
",-0.3182,0.8201,2021-01-04 00:00:00,7,Keanu lookedso differnet in thisfilm. He didnt say a lot either. Its a bit roundabout but done in a clever way. Yes its right at the end that everything is revealed so stick with it.
" A Story That Unravels Rather Than Being Told
",0.0,0.9553,2020-12-13 00:00:00,10,"If you know little about films, you might think this film is slow. If you come to this film based on the synopsis of a bad cop and revenge, you will be disappointed. But if you have an open mind and love films, you will understand this director doesn't want to tell you the story but let you experience it and find out what really happened.
This is a masterpiece in story telling, and amazingly we watched it again the next day only to make sense of the hints that were being dropped along the way. It is that good a film, that it works better after you've discovered what happened in the end.
Some confuse the spiritual and psychological aspect of the film as sci-fi, but you need to have read more than comics to come to this film and appreciate a masterful piece of work."
" Haters Got To Hate
",-0.7845,0.7815,2020-12-10 00:00:00,6,"This is by no means a perfect film but it absolutely is not a 1 or 2, seems like some people define good films by the number of cars that get blown up.
This is a film about a psychological breakdown (Armas) within a murder investigation (Reeves) hampered by a cover up and you need to stick with it to see the whole picture.
The film has an ethereal mood with religious overtones and well developed sense of Spanish family. The acting is fine (Reeves is certainly more nuanced than the John Wick cartoon hyper violence) and the plot more developed than many bigger budget efforts. Where it falls down is in the editing leaving the final product uneven and disjointed but having read that Lionsgate butchered the film in post production and the director disowned what they released probably explains that.
Certainly not a classic, but worth an hour forty of your time."
" Muddled mess
",-0.3612,-0.1945,2020-12-02 00:00:00,2,"Not one of Keanu's finest.

" Not what I expected
",0.0,-0.7789,2020-11-24 00:00:00,9,"This was not at all what I expected and if I had known the themes involved I probably would not have chosen to watch it.
That said, I found it a really moving exploration of loss and pain; the lead actress was incredible and the contrast between the different communities represented really brought home how stratified and fragmented life in the states can be.
I found Keanu Reeves very believable in this role and I suspect some people just struggled with him playing a not particularly engaging or attractive character. It is not for the faint hearted and, as I mentioned before, deals with some difficult themes."
" Surprise twist ending worth watching for
",0.4588,0.6124,2020-11-13 00:00:00,6,They probably didn't need the 2 separate storylines going and focuses more on her and integrated a Keanu's storyline but oh well. Slow movie but worth watching and seeing the ending.

Don't listen to the reviews, watch it and then you can decide for yourself if you like it or not. I think it deserves more than 4.3"
" If you want to be depressed, watch this
",-0.4588,-0.4673,2020-07-17 00:00:00,1,"I don't usually hate movies or people or situations, I just try to see the good and make the best of life. Unfortunately due to the mishandling of this pandemic by someone I actually do hate I have no sports so am choosing movies as a brief escape from it all. Never a smile, a light moment or a GD clue about what is actually happening to these people in this gritty part of NYC. The kid with the unicorn who we cared so much about turns out to be our lead protagonist and next thing you know people are getting killed or dying left and right with fake blood flowing freely and abusers getting their just desserts. WTF Keano, just looking at you makes me want to jump off a bridge.

Oh and there's a virgin birth, weird ghost apparition things... Or are there?The movie just feels all over the place and unfocused. They more or less explain what's going on and even then it's deeply unsatisfying and downright unpleasant. The director is aiming at some dark, heavy themes here but he fails to hit the mark and that makes this very uncomfortable and not at all the character exploration and revelation is meant to be.Big swing and a big miss on this one."

Nothing made sense in this, then the weird ghost creatures... I was like... What is going on. What was up with the stupid unicorn?

The switching between languages was so forced that it detracts from the movie itself and makes me want to never watch a movie that attempts this again.

Until this movie, about the only movie Keanu ever did, that I wasn't happy with was Knock Knock. Now there are 2.Very slow, very confusing, they try to make not telling you what is exactly going on, like it is suspense, but it feels more like I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie.Keanu is pumping out 4-5 movies per year right now, probably trying to cash in as fast as he can due to his aging starting to show.

It should have been called the Daughter of God, which was a perfect title, not some lame generalist title, that was PC and not meant to offend various churches and church officials (none of whom would get this film, anyway). Other than that, the film is almost perfect, and I am a very demanding and cynical critic, who also happens to be an agnostic taoist. So, it would have been a piece of cake for me to pan this film like the vast majority of others (most probably for religious reasons), but I base my critiques on scripts (this one was great), character development (this film did a great job with that as well), direction and cinematography (once again, the film was almost impeccable), and some of the finest work ever done by Keanu Reeves, an actor with several hits as well as a few misses in the past. Why any unbiased movie critic would pan this film is beyond me. See it for yourself and then decide if the film captures Washington Heights, where I once lived. It recaptured it for me. It avoided needless chase scenes and mindless violence (unless it was germane to the plot), It is a multi-layered film, in the mold of Serpico and Donnie Brasco, rather than a mindless ""action cop"" film, which is probably why so many mediocre critics panned it. Mindless under-30s, who have no concept of film composition or complexity of a screenplay. They are not critics; they are wanna-be Hollywood formula addicts, and this film does not conform to their formulas. Forget about the other ratings; see the movie and decide for yourself."

" Deep, Thought-Provoking Study on Trauma and Loss
",-0.6249,-0.9938,2019-08-16 00:00:00,9,"First, what this movie is NOT:
If you are looking for a fast-paced kick-ass Keanu Reeves protagonist wreaking mayhem on the bad guys stop reading. Look for a different movie. This is not for you.
However, if you are open to the idea of an action star stepping outside his normal genre (think Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense) then this movie might be for you.
This movie looks at how trauma and loss effect people differently as they try to make sense of a crumbling world.
Isabel, the main character is trying to deal with trauma that occurs not only during the movie, but earlier in her life.
Galban (Keanu Reeves character) is trying to unravel the brutal murder of his detective partner. Suspects and potential witnesses all end up dead. Also, in a scene that lasts about 15 seconds we learn of his estranged family and Galban's attempt to block out his past.
Cullen's (Galban's partner) wife is facing not only the murder of her husband, but the persistent rumors that he was a corrupt cop.
Each person handles their trauma and loss differently, each with consequences.

As a fan of Keanu, I am appalled that he should associate himself with so many incompetent contributors.There must have been a specific call put out to the school of overacting, with an emphasis on a call for the always reliable Mira Sorvino.Since there are many outlets and platforms for Latin and Spanish language entertainment, I, being of the heritage, resent the forced imposition of the language into the entertainment of an English speaking country without the express warning of it's dominance in the material that is presented."

The""supernatural"" element is a mental lightning storm. Once you figure it out, you'll wonder why you didn't see it earlier. The story is a fantastic, intricate tangle of events.Keanu Reeves is a supporting character at best. He pushes the story along. His relationship with his dead partner's wife is fluff. Although, Mira Sorvino did a good job in her role. His character's backstory is confetti. His cop hangs onto one sliver of evidence found that might connect to the female lead, Isabel.Played by Ana de Amas, she is the main character of the movie. You need to pay attention to what happens to her. Every other character (not the police characters) supports her story in some way. She gives an otherwise mousey character depth and strength."

",-0.5583,-0.9959,2019-05-20 00:00:00,2,"This is a terrible film with only one redeeming feature... oh two; 1. Keanu Reeves and 2. The end credits.Even Reeves couldn't save this miss-mash of a piece. It's billed as ""Cop investigates his partner's murder..."" but the investigation part is thin on the ground and if you're thinking Law and Order police procedural you can forget it.The story follows a circuitous route, and no logical path. The ""clues"" such as they are are covered over by ghostly apparitions or weird occurrences, and it doesn't make sense. The story is not helped by odd chopping and changing of characters' action, names of characters not clear and the plot being non-existent. Characters' reactions and dialogue are unrealistic and stilted, conversation seems strained and the best performer was a Staffordshire bull terrier. The most relatable character was only seen on Skype (or similar). All explanatory dialogue was missing leaving you always guessing. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish, with subtitles, which usually doesn't bother me but in this it was just another thing that was difficult to follow in the film.If sexual assault as a topic is something you don't like in a film, avoid this.Keanu, as always, is the solid determined guy... again the grieving widow, troubled and unapproachable, shy and proper. However, his dialogue is even more monosyllabic than usual. The script is shocking; dull and un-imaginative. Together with the bad dialogue, the direction and editing are choppy and inconsistent, and all over the place.The film is depressing. Nothing good. Nothing charming or pleasing. It's just unpleasant and grim.I can't recommend this film, as I said, even Reeves' normal charisma was burried and couldn't shine through this horrible storytelling."
" Not Worth The Time
",-0.1695,-0.572,2019-04-09 00:00:00,3,I sat through the entire movie and was disappointed. The premise of a supernatural event didn't work and was misleading. Keanu's story line was unnecessary. Who cares if he didn't have any friends. Who cares that he was a father that didn't know how to raise his son. I didn't think the acting was particularly good although Ana was decent. Her visions seemed a little extreme and I didn't buy it with the exception of the little girl. The added story line of the criminals also didn't seem to have a point. I gave it a few stars because it did make me wonder what in the heck was going on but the payoff didn't satisfy me for the time invested.

",-0.5994,0.9972,2019-03-30 00:00:00,5,"I think a director should always deserve credit for the good parts of a movie before you start in on the bad. Sooo....The female lead was wonderful. She was a perfect pick for the lead. She has an innocence and a beauty that just shines through the movie. Not to spoil the end, but that innocence is pretty important to the plot. She never failed to keep me interested even as the rest of the movie fell apart around her. The filming and camera work was also wonderful. As for the plot... It's hard to give a solid review knowing that the director was not happy with what the producers (Lions Gate) ultimately ended up doing to the film but we do have to review what we are given, alas. (That said, I would love to watch the original uncut film). I understand now the purpose behind so many subplots and how things tie together in the end but can't help but feel it could have all been done better. And some sub plots should have just been left on the cutting room floor. The whole bit of Keenue and his partner's wife for instance. Yawn. And the bit with Keenu's kid.. another yawn. For that matter, Keenu should have been left on the cutting room floor. I sometimes really enjoy his stilted acting in films that it works, like the Matrix or John Wick, but in a move that really demands some serious deep work such as this one I think he falls way short.As for the strange beings... OK, I can go along with them but I cant help but feel the hallucinating dream like quality worked better in the original. Except for the the man in the subway the women just kind of didn't fit. So, over all, I found it an interesting but no where close to great movie. I think with a better choice for the male lead, less intrusion from the producers and IT'S ORIGINAL TITLE it may have been a great film."

This is a movie that you MUST watch closely. You can't sleep walk through this film it requires you to pay attention. I'm not going to spoil anything but if you watch this film watch very closely and stay with it through the end.

There have been 10,000 movies made about this topic. No one cares anymore!!!! When will Hollywood learn???!!!"

This is not a movie. This is a series of psychotically arranged vignettes meant to drive the viewer insane.Nothing ever leads to anything. The two separate stories never connect at ANY point. Regardless of the fact that they are told in a manner attempting to make them appear to want to coalesce at some point.This is the single worst film I have ever watched in my entire life. Ana de Armas is gorgeous and is one hell of an actress. Keanu Reeves gives a good performance as a tortured and bottled up individual. But all of their effort is for nothing, as the film insists on flushing anything good it might have had going for it...right down the toilet.And let's not forget an absolutely unnecessarily graphic, brutal, and gut wrenching rape scene thrown in...just for kicks apparently.If you enjoy being put in a headlock while simultaneously being kicked in the crotch over and over and over again, then this film is for you.Otherwise, run.

" ""Me too""
",0.0,-0.9813,2019-03-19 00:00:00,8,"Most of the people criticizing this film do not understand that it is about a woman's rape by her own father (and the mother knows) since she was a child, her efforts to suppress the memories, then a rape again by the dead cop whose murder is under investigation. The death of her husband killed in action (hence the wedding ring lost during the rape) is the split from the only man who loved her, and the little girl she takes care of is of course her own self she mothers. The dead cop is her justified homicide with the knife her brother-in-law gave her for protection. The complaints about the disjointed plot construction miss the fact it is mostly perfect because the past and both shock and trauma caused by men that women should be able to trust are in memory shards until the trigger pulls everything together. It is not a brilliant film (the side plots fail), but it is definitely effective....as any victim of violence, especially rape, knows too well."

My biggest gripe about this movie is the fact that it jumps all over the place. They try and throw in some crazy twist and it just doesn't work at all. There are supernatural beings (or something) that are never fully explained. The one thing stopping me from giving this movie the lowest grade possible is the lead actress.

Two different movies, a Spanish movie about religious beliefs and a strange cop movie, squished into one. The saddest part was that by the time I got to a point where it was so cheesy that I should have turned it off, I was too interested in finding out how the girl got pregnant.

" NO CONTENT WARNING! VIOLENT RAPE SCENE
",-0.9259,-0.9981,2019-03-10 00:00:00,1,"This film was some of the worst cinematic work I have seen in a while. Not only does it take waaayyyy too long for the story to start making rational connections to Reeves' and Armas' characters--by the time it does, I have begun to lose any real interest--but there are also too many pointless subplots I feel are just serving as filler. BUT, my number one complaint here is the fact that THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CONTENT WARNING! Not to go into too much detail with strangers, but I have been living with PTSD for the better half of my life from sexual violence. Therefore, I rely on movie production companies, or whatever source is going to provide access to watch their productions (i.e. Netflix), or, any online movie review or information database sites that are supposed to give the rundown on films (i.e. IMDb), to provide accurate and clear content warnings (i.e. WARNING: THIS FILM CONTAINS VIOLENT SEXUAL ASSAULT) about films that contain depictions that could potentially trigger somebody's PTSD symptoms. I am calling Netflix out for not screening for these things and warning their customers, even if the primary production company should have been the first to provide such warning. I also, obviously, hold the producers of this film accountable for failing to consider why it would be crucial to include a content warning (there are too many contributors to the production of this film to list here). Furthermore, IMDb, you failed here too. Even if the aforementioned entities failed to do their part, YOU COULD HAVE! It's not like you don't know the plot?! Seriously, WTF, you're supposed to be a movie/TV/etc. review and information database site.Finally, if I'd have known the climax of this film was the full coverage flashback of the main character's violent rape by a dirty cop, I would have shut it off not even halfway through. This movie is absolute trash."

This is the kind of movie that people don't even finish watching. The supernatural business is lame and so are the ""spooky"" sight gags. They wouldn't scare a child.
The pregnancy thing was stupid and cliche. So was the religious business. The sub-titles and Spanish dialogue quickly become annoying. And if you like action, this isn't the movie for you.
You get the sense that this film could have been easily changed into a completely different movie in the editing room. Like they shot the scenes then put the movie together. And really didn't know exactly what would result.
You start the movie hoping it will be a good police drama starring Keanu Reeves and it ends up being a slow-moving melodrama. And one of the most boring films in recent memory. I'm still yawning."

But all was not lost. There were even hints of greatness. The story that counted, that of Isabel and Elisa, was told heartbreakingly well, and that is the story that I will take away and remember from this production. Magical realism is not always, and in fact, when I think about it, seldom is, sweetness and light. it is a concoction, an overlay, created by a fevered unconscious that has been, at one time or another, shattered so badly it had to recreate itself. In the story of Isabel and Elisa, we are observers of that process.
Have patience with this film, and let the police procedural glide by in the background Let Isabel and Elisa tell you their story. As I said...there were moments of greatness."

Striking performances by some of the supporting cast, especially Mira Sorvino, but not enough is revealed until the end to appreciate the acting of the leads; which seems stilted since not enough background characterization is given. Perhaps this film must be watched again to really appreciate it but its so dull and gritty that sitting through it once is a challenge (had to take it in two seperate sessions) let alone twice.

We worked out what was fantasy and what was real from that.That said, it was a poignant portrayal of people dealing with violence and tragedy in different ways. The side plots were intended to divert attention from the main plot and worked well within the overall construct.Ana de Armas is excellent in her portrayal of the tragic innocent.

Disjointed execution of the plot and withholding evidence from the viewers until the end of the film. *spoiler alert* We never know why Detective Galban (Keanu) has an interest in Isabel (Anna) until we see the wedding ring and shoe heel evidence recovered from the first murder crime scene, with about 10min left in the movie. Isabel is a pleasure to look at, so lovely, clean and faithful and I was never bored when she was on screen. Galban on the other hand was a lead weight, bumbling his way through both his investigation, personal life, and sex with Sorvino. Mira Sorvino injected a little life into the non-latin side of the film, but suffered from acting opposite Keanu and dull film quality. There was some street gang interactions and murders that made little to no sense. The ending rounds things out relatively well as we learn of the rapes and incest that let to multiple murders, but it's a painful road for the viewer to get that far."

",0.3182,0.8675,2018-05-20 00:00:00,5,"Let me stat by saying I really like Keanu Reeves. Most of his movies are very entertaining and have a relatively simple plot. There's good guys and there's bad guys. This movie ain't that. This movie does keep with a familiar theme though, angels, devils, heaven, hell, and of course, wickedness. But the problem is that it is a story told in a very unsatisfying manner. If you walk away, after seeing this movie, with a satisfied feeling, you are a very strange person. I'm tempted to give it 2 stars, because of the feeling of emptiness when the movie ended. But the actors did a credible job at telling the tale. The production values are good and the movie did fit into a certain genre, it's just that I felt worse for seeing it. If you love Keanu, you'll stick with it. But for me, I need to rewatch the John Wick flicks. Maybe a couple of times. Just to reset my head."

" A risky mystery, satisfying for some
",0.296,-0.9259,2018-03-10 00:00:00,7,"The bad reviews must have been based on dashed expectations of those looking for a Keanu Reeves shoot 'em up. (Please! They are still counting up the dead in the Wick films.). This film is better than its overall review scores, and in spite of the fact that the director hid behind a pseudonym. You do need to pay attention to the braided plot lines, one in Spanish with subtitles and the other in English, and they each tell compelling stories that come together at the end. As a writer of mysteries, I was intrigued with the approach to this one. The story telling method was a risk, which obviously does not appeal to all, even the ""pro"" critics (who should be ignored at all costs anyway). For many, though, the film will satisfy."
" Joey was no choir boy
",-0.296,-0.9121,2018-02-23 00:00:00,3,"Scotty (Keanu Reeves) is investigating the murder of his police partner Joey. As the investigation goes on Joey becomes dirtier. His wife (Mira Sorvino) proclaims, ""Joey was no choir boy."" Meanwhile Isabel (Ana de Armas) who is connected to one of the suspects is having visions. Her husband is in Iraq as she says the rosary daily for him. As time goes on, the over clued mystery open up.Keanu Reeves played a very bland character. They could have hired Christian Slater to do the part and saved some money. He was snooze-fest boring and not well developed. Isabel was an interesting up lifting person, eerily saintly in her actions helping the poor and children.This is a crime drama you can wait to see.Guide: F-bomb. No nudity."
" Watchable, convoluted, but watchable!
",0.0,0.5644,2017-10-22 00:00:00,5,"It seems most folk didn't like the film for its weirdness! I agree with most views actually, especially the stories that run supposedly parallel with each other. There are two central story lines that merge, Keanu's detective trying to find the truth about his partners murder, and a young girl who see's visions, is in love with a soldier out in Iraq and appears caring and happy! There is a few other story lines that don't really add to the film in my view, the gangster, the tramp, the affair with the deceased's wife and the visions! They are a distraction from what is essentially a tragic story of childhood abuse and repression. Take out these useless bits and the film is interesting but inconclusive. I liked it, it made me think about it afterwards and I didn't want my hour and 40 back!"
" Poor Keanu has truly lost it...
",-0.3612,-0.9791,2017-10-11 00:00:00,1,"Apart from the fact Keanu looked bored out of his skull in this actual disaster (or is that he looks that way in all his films now?), he actually has moved into production as he produced it - oh dear!!!All of the acting was wooden and laboured (no change for Keanu there then) and especially the eyebrow actress and i used the term loosely of Ana De Armas who has already proved many times that she quite simply couldn't act her way out of a paper bag but presumably as she is so attractive that is what counts as talent these days - how sad for the industry.And what is it these days with the subtitles and putting half the movie in a foreign language ie Spanish??? It isn't arty, it doesn't add anything to the movie; in fact it actually detracts from the movie as not everyone is literate these days or can keep up with subtitles.What I would like to know is why did they insert the red and white characters from Hunger Games lol as....presumably Angels; I say presumably because the whole story is complete unfathomable and the narrative is so disconnected its quite hard not to get bored and loose attention.This is by far the worst film I have seen since the worst movie this year in which Keanu also played one of his weirdest roles , the utterly dire BAD BATCH - one of the worst film I have ever seen and an exercise in artsy fartsy pseudo intellectual clap trap that some people actually bought into going by their reviews! This film, whilst not as bad is just as inexplicable and tries too hard to be mysteriously artsy fartsy.The original title was ""Daughter Of God"" i believe - no wonder they changed it!"
" Do not aggravate yourself with this film.

If your not the person who made the movie this is how you feel up until the absolute end. You feel like your watching 2 separate people's lives and your not getting what the connection is. Then they add these weird sci-fi type characters and to this day I don't understand the point of the albino guy and Japanese lady. So you have this woman who was raped by her father or stepfather and the writer of the movie has her seeing herself as a little girl but you don't know she's seeing herself you think it's a little girl in her class!! How stupid!! On top of that the woman becomes pregnant yet her husband is in Iraq fighting a war and she goes around telling people she's like the Virgin Mary and God planted the baby in her womb!! Huh??!!! So at the end of the movie you learn Keanu reeves partner Joey raped her in the subway the night she sees the albino ghost and she was the one who killed Joey. she stabbed him in the back and pushed him on the tracks. I don't know any grown woman who would get raped, wind up pregnant and not remember any of it to the point you tell people(your dead husbands family) the baby got in her womb supernaturally. This movie was so bad."
" bad movie with a bad message to boot
",-0.7906,-0.6558,2017-06-23 00:00:00,4,"Just on a technical level i'd give it a 6.5 out of 10. The two story lines move at a snail's pace and don't have much depth. The movie plot can be summed up in one long sentence. The acting is pretty spotty apart from the lead actress who does a decent job. The script is pretty robotic sounding and Keanu Reeves delivers his usual robotic performance which he does so well and it fits the character that it's actually OK. The movie has it's moments, uses music effectively at times and does portray life as not always being neat and packaged like a lot of Hollywood movies mistakenly do and lose their interest by being artificially black and white. I lower the score from a 6.5 to a 4 though because the movie's underlying message is pretty bad.It seems to excuse murder as being OK or even good. Murder isn't the correct response to being upset by something. Even if that something is a horrible experience. You're not a hero when you do worse things than the villains do. Sorry. Basically don't waste your time on this."

The only good choice made by anyone involved in this movie, is making Ana de Armas portray whoever the hell she was supposed to be playing in this film. Ana de Armas... Ana-de- friggin'-Armas!!! I WILL be, dedicating an ENTIRE star to her alone.The other star is for everything/nothing else. This film is just bad. I'm sure when it was pitched, it sounded thrilling and enthralling... Little did Keanu and Ana know, that Declan or Gee, or XYZ, would completely screw them over.I thought this movie was a Crime Thriller Mystery. I didn't know anything about it at all. Then we see the white haired and bearded man float above the train tracks, and suddenly you feel a pleasant surprise arise. Is it a Sci-Fi? Is it supernatural? Your interest just, hits the roof.Guess what, it is a Crime Thriller Mystery. Now, I absolutely love that genre combo, but what was done here, is an absolute atrocity. This movie is just rubbish, in so many ways. Directing, acting, story, script, editing... Shoddy. The concept is AMAZING... The execution however, appalling.Sure, Joey was taking pictures of Isabel, followed her, raped her, then she killed him. How the story was told though was; Isabel is extremely religious, saw an angel and became the Virgin Mary. The rape story was COMPLETELY omitted, and not ONCE hinted, until the VERY end and the Elisa gambit/illusion was shattered halfway through the movie, when what seemed like another human being, acknowledged Elisa. In hindsight, the dots connect, but, the picture revealed is, disjointed. Also, was I the only one who finished this entire movie under the impression that it was called ""EXPOSED""?Anyway, 3/10. 1 whole star for Ana alone... She is so worth it. The other star is for, I don't know... being so absurdly humdrum and monotonous that they could run that Isabel and Elisa ruse for as long as they did... And another star also, for the man with the electrolarynx."

",0.0,-0.2867,2017-05-09 00:00:00,8,"In the first place, I was not enjoy the movie at all. There were so many many questions popped in my brain. The background sounds were similar to messages, like, the director and the script writer imply a watcher something. Many people just be annoyed by ton of mysteries. Plus, who are the floating white guy, and fashioned women (sometime red, sometimes white). @_@ - dizzyHonestly, the movie is just boring.After that, at the end, all mysteries were solved. It was about some sort of mental disorders. Something beyond a watcher's expectation. It was turned from forehand to backhand. And I said ""What!?!?"".Overall: It is a good mysterious story to watch. However, the scriptwriter emitted too many puzzles to a watcher. As a result, some cannot keep an eye on the film until the last minute to see what was going on. Actually I am not a fun of a mysterious film, but it is watchable."

" Kudos to Keanu Reeves for letting Black and Hispanic actors shine.
",0.5106,0.5713,2017-04-20 00:00:00,9,"I was pleasantly surprised that Keanu Reeves did more than lend his name to an indie film while playing an understated role that didn't overshadow the other actors in a film he co-produced. The film was not flawless, but it was well worth watching. The two seemingly unrelated stories come together to a startling end. The film didn't deserve the negative comments in many of the reviews here, which probably stem from the discomfort many feel in facing the difficult subject matter."

But, this movie is so awful, that i see it as my duty to warn anyone who might want to see this movie.I thought Keanu Reeves was a guarantee stamp for quality, but now I'm wondering if he is broke since he participated in this movie?This movie is disgrace for all movies, there is no plot or anything, it's literally bullshit and clichés.The director must had been taking some hallucination drugs, since he/she lost track of what was going on!It's amazing that the people involved in this movie didn't stop it from being released!Never ever have I wasted my time that bad. Seriously, spend some time with your wife/girlfriend etc. Instead, make some food, let it be today, instead of watching this awful movie."
" What The....?
",0.0,-0.626,2017-04-07 00:00:00,5,"Given a stylish look by cinematographer Trevor Frost - along with a pensively down beat pace by New York born writer/director Gee Malik Linton, this movie seems at odds with itself. Linton disowned the finished picture following heavy editing alterations by the distributor. It seems we may never know who committed the biggest crime - the distributor, writer or director? Whoever it was nothing was gained, as it lost out big time. Lovely Cuban born Ana De Armas works hard in her difficult role of delusional child-care worker - with Keanu Reeves suitably restrained as a tough detective investigating his partners hidden past and brutal death.There are some genuinely intriguing moments (even haunting) but as the story unfolds it all becomes just too ugly. There's also far too many nasty sub-plots (all running simultaneously) to allow the average viewer to generate a great deal of focused interest. Would it have been any better if not interfered with? difficult to say but somehow, with one too many convoluted situations I don't assume so.Talented Cuban composer Carlos Jose Alvarez creates an evocative mood by using a female voice performing a mystical song without words, nice.Overall: If your taste runs towards confusing plot lines that may (or may not) all fall into place it might hold your interest - otherwise, unpleasant and ultimately disappointing."
" So Bad i was .. Well just bad!
",-0.7569,-0.8053,2017-04-06 00:00:00,1,I watched this on DVD which fortunately meant that I didn't waste too much money on it and I had the luxury of eventually giving up trying to make any sense of it and fast forwarding through pointless scenes with rubbish acting and directing.Even Keanu couldn't save this tripe of a movie.The story line could have been good but the script was nonsensical and the director didn't seem to know what type of movie he was making.I won't accuse the so called movie makers of using illegal substances while making this diatribe but at least that would explain how bad it is.
" Riveting to the end!
",0.0,-0.9464,2017-04-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie has received many negative reviews, obviously from people who either weren't intelligent enough to understand what was going on in the movie, or simply didn't watch it to the end to see the various plot lines resolved. Key hint in that sentence: YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT TO THE END TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. You won't figure out what is going on until the end, when all the pieces fall into place. This is a story of Isabel's damage/traumas, coupled alongside the mystery of revealing said damage/traumas, along with a great 'whodunnit' element. In the beginning you are initially confused, then your confusion will grow into suspicion as you sense that there is another narrative at play. It is extremely intriguing, shocking, and emotionally wrenching in the end.Also, some reviewers mocked the mix of languages and subtitles used in this film, and all I have to say to that is the people who didn't like it are probably simply not intelligent enough to keep up with what is going on. Don't let the negative reviewers keep you from seeing this suspenseful work."
" EVERYTHING is explained in the end, you morons!

And you have to be an even *more* special kind of stupid to be able to NOT keep up with the mix between Spanish and English. It is common for Hispanics and Latinos to use a mix of English and Spanish when speaking, especially when in mixed company or when they have grown up in an English-speaking country, like, say, America, where the setting of this film is located. Seriously, if you get confused just by the language, I don't understand how you've survived this long.As far as the plot goes, it was truly riveting and cleverly put together. This movie is like a giant puzzle--the bigger picture isn't clearly revealed until the end for you folks with below-average IQs. I figured out the story well before the end due to the whole ""Elisa"" scenario, but I was still very interested to see how the film makers were going to explain it in the context of the film, and I wasn't disappointed.You won't be disappointed, either, if you a) are smart enough to keep up with what's going on in the movie and b) are patient enough to see the big reveal in the end."

When someone dies in the movie, you don't know about it until a character mentions it, that's only one instance of a plot hole. After watching the entire movie, the movie also basically tells you the entire movie was pointless except for the end, which pointed back to the false beginning. It is a slap in the face for anyone who watched the movie, it makes the entire movie seem pointless. The protagonist also hallucinates the whole movie, and you can't tell what was really happening or fake. I would urge you to not watch this movie, you will be gravely disappointed and confused."

In the end we do find out who Elisa really is (spoiler alert) yet . . . Scotty meets her as a little girl! There's no logic to that. Keanu is the lead actor in this film, yet he has very few lines, mostly short one-liners (as in some other recent movies he's made, such as John Wick 1 and 2).This is one of the weirdest movies I've seen in a long time: thin plot, logic mistakes, no character development, pointless sex.

Rather than spoil everything by telling the pessimist what happens, I suggest you take a risk, and watch the film. The ending does make a lot more sense than a heck of a lot of other films that I have seen in the past year, so I refuse to join the queue of sceptics. To say the acting is rubbish ( 1 reviewer ) I beg to disagree here, and the script does help just a little more in explaining things towards the end of the film."

I picked this title and, dear Lord, how wrong I was.This half-English-half-Spanish spoken movie really confused me a lot, from the beginning until the end. No matter how hard you are trying to follow the story-line, you simply can't make a connection what or why something happened.Scenes are just jumping from one to another, of course not related to each other, which left me with big question mark above my head, asking my self. ""What the Hell?"". Bad writing, bad acting, I mean, I am really disappointed with Keanu. I was really looking forward to this movie because of him.For sure, there isn't any moment that you will remember in a good way, but on the other side, definitely for me, the saddest moment was the death of a beautiful dog. And there again, I am not sure the meaning of that death, either.My advice, don't waste your time with this, better go watch ""John Wick"" for 10 more times."
