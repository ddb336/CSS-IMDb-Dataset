" Lovely, good-feel Flick
",0.5859,0.9918,2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"This is a wonderful film, with a wonderful plot. Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have beautiful chemistry and really make this film. It is paced very nicely, and has some very subtly sweet moments indeed. The story unfolds well, and develops into a very enjoyable watch. The jokes and comedy wasn't overbearing. It is amusing and humorous in all the right places, and serious and emotional in others. All characters are played well and are very warm and developed. A well rounded film indeed. Loved it!"
" Heart touching
",0.0,0.9527,2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,Very simple plot but very hear touching. The chemistry of both the characters is wonderful. Idea of seniors interns is imaging. A blend of fast pace internet business and it challenges give a good touch. Really loved this movie.
" A Lovely Movie to pass some time with a Pizza and a Beer
",0.5859,0.8804,2021-03-13 00:00:00,10,"Have seen it a lot of times, Robert De Niro at his best he genuinely looks so cool, Anne Hathaway cute as always.... Remember her since The Princess Diaries times and eventually she is still the same...."
" It's beautiful
",0.5994,0.8904,2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,"It had a beautiful plot, extremely talented actors and a simple yet comforting execution. Honestly, it calmed my anxious mind and I can't be more thankful that I chose this movie for the night."
" Nice heartwarming movie...
",0.7096,0.9761,2021-02-17 00:00:00,9,"Just watch this movie and don't be critical or analysing it cause it's not made for that, it's just for having a good time.
I have watched all the ""good movies"" and mostly I watch them only but occasionally I like watching this normal drama comedy and this one was a good one. But nowdays they don't make these kinds of movies it's all just serious drama or crime. However good those movies might be but these comedy drama also have their place in movie business.
Ofcourse de Niro and Anne Hatheway were delight to watch, their chemistry was too good."
" Amazing to see something like this
",0.743,0.8074,2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,In the era of avengers and other super hero movies its very rare to find a gem like this which talks about real problems

" I expected to hate this...
",-0.5719,0.9912,2021-02-08 00:00:00,8,"I expected to hate this, but De Niro is my favourite actor so I figured I'd give it a go.I can't stand schmaltz. Can't stand jazz, soppy stories with light comedy moments, anything about New York, anything involving trendy hipsters or precocious but cute kids... and I've always thought Anne Hathaway was overrated.Yet here I am, admitting I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Ms Hathaway was wonderfully convincing in the role. The story was wholesome (albeit with some unnecessary swearing in one instance, which soured it slightly), poignant and entertaining. And believable. The story reflects the reality of our age, and the roles we're assigned by society. It deals really well with the image of women as powerful figures, and with age-related perceptions.The biggest let-down (only in my opinion, obviously) was from Mr De Niro. His acting in The Mission remains one of the best performances I have watched to date, but I think maybe he should choose his comedy roles more carefully."
" Wholesome.

Definitely recommend it to anyone who loves wholesome and sweet movies.

" Failing at being entertaining and a feel-good movie.
",-0.1027,0.1149,2021-02-04 00:00:00,2,"It's trying too hard to make a point, but it's not that relevant when you live outside of Far Left Land. Not even the cast makes you want to keep watching. And some of them are like nails on a blackboard. Also they seem to be stealing a lot of ideas from other movies with the same theme. Don't waste your time."
" The special bonding between a young lady & a (grand) father - figure.
",0.4019,0.9867,2021-01-28 00:00:00,8,"While watching Nancy Meyer's 'The Holiday', it occured to me that the story of the special bonding between Kate Winslet & Eli Wallach is the most endearing sub-plot of the movie.In 'The Intern', this special bonding has been amplified & augmented nicely. Anne Hathaway is vibrant & successful but could do with a bit of (grand) fatherly attention & care (something that she may have missed in her childhood, having a mother with a strong personality).The trust & affection between the two characters, build up naturally & nicely.An enjoyable movie, with some pleasant & non contrived lessons about life."

" This movie is perfectly fine
",0.7184,0.8297,2020-12-21 00:00:00,8,"It flowed like a river that has few curves and by borrowing the phrase from this movie where Anne Hathaway was commenting on Robert De Niro, saying ""uncanny"".This movie shows the imperfections of human in every corner where Ben kinda perplexed between two women at the beginning and Jules got confused with her purpose of life (running a business) when she found her husband's affair.The atmosphere of this movie wasn't that exiting nor breathtaking but the dramatic sides of it covered everything, enough to end with a rightful happy ending. Good movie."
" Fantastic
",0.5574,0.7388,2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,"Great movie, rarely comes to watch such a nicely made movie. These would be watched daily, but very few films reach this level. The score I gave is already top for me."
" a feel-good movie
",0.0,0.9505,2020-12-01 00:00:00,8,"The Intern centers around an elderly guy who gets hired by an upstart company, which only seems to employ millennials. Apparently someone threatened them with ageism, so they decided to start a Senior Intern program --- something I've never heard of.That to me is at the heart of what makes this movie great. I mean, there either are companies out there using the concept of senior interns, or this movie's premise is completely original and I love originality.Concept aside, I imagine the script is a page-turner, because it's a movie that sucks me in and makes me interested in what's going to happen next.First this old guy gets a job with young whippersnappers, he's assigned to the owner of the company, she wants nothing to do with him, but their relationship begins to evolve when the old guy spots her driver sipping from a bottle before he has to take Jules somewhere. So ""Ben"" confronts him and the driver takes the day off (never to return).The story ensues from there.There are so many good moments in the film that I don't want to rehash, but if you like feel-good, I'd recommend this. Manly men probably won't like this as DeNiro's a marshmallow, there's no real ""cool"" stuff, but I've seen the movie multiple times and haven't gotten sick of it."
" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.4588,2020-11-28 00:00:00,10,Legend for a reason. The movie is short sweet and so touching. Such a breather.
" This movie deserves 8.5+ IMDB

" Couldn't get past the poor acting
",-0.4767,0.7783,2020-11-14 00:00:00,2,Too many cringe moments to enjoy the story. It's like the script is trying too hard to fit into an agenda instead of just telling a story.
" Boring tropes
",-0.3182,-0.3182,2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,Politically correct movie with bizarre story telling and things just working out. Need 10 million dollars? Here you go. Because it's that kind of movie.
" Sweet and heart touching movie
",0.4588,0.9884,2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"'The Intern' tells a story of a retiree (played by Robert De Niro) who, after being satiated with the usual life of a retired elderly person, gets an internship at the fast-growing fashion company, and the CEO of that company (Anne Hathaway), who is an extremely determined workaholic and is torn between devoting enough time to family and work. The intern's wisdom and support is very helpful and brings peace of mind to the constantly troubled boss.In the wrapper of a light comedy and adventure film, it presents some ideas which would be great to every of us to take into account:
not to label people and to know that there are always more factors to play than just standard stereotypes;
it is never too late to start over and pursue your happiness;
sometimes during your busy life you just need to stop and look around to become happier.The film addresses two acute problems at once: the talent pool of retirees, whom no one wants to hire, despite their experience (or who are not taken seriously in the modern business), and the problem of balance between work and family for women entrepreneurs, who usually feel guilty for not being able to cope with everything. It realistically shows the problems and prejudices that these social stratas can face, without showing them ridiculous and inept.The plot of the 'The Intern' is exciting and funny, it contains both wonderful jokes and heartbreaking moments associated with the experiences of the main characters; the acting and the director's work are also great. It is sweet and heart touching movie that will help recover your emotional well-being."
" Great and inspiring film
",0.7845,0.9785,2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Film ""The Intern"" is a great example of strong and impressive humans' lives regardless of age and gender. To start with, this story is about the old widower Ben, who has tried everything in his life, but being an intern is a novel experience for him. It is surprising, but he immediately becomes a personal intern of the boss (Jules), that is a young and very powerful woman, even somebody tell him: ""Hang in there."", but in response, Ben only smiles. Their relations with the boss are not good, he was deprived of Jules' attention, may be because she mistakenly think, that elder cannot help her. Nevertheless, their story begins, when Ben perfectly deals with a problem of Jules' drunk driver. Here viewer shakes hands with scenarist on the fact that only internal qualities of people matter, not age, not gender, not religion... It is very surprising, but ambitious woman and experienced elder become best friends. Ben was the man, who rescued Jules' life from two very dangerous decisions, so sometimes very unexpected things (such as an internship for elder) gives the opportunities, one has never dreamed of. Jules is sometimes unhappy, her staff is offering a new CEO for her company (to replace her), moreover her husband has an affair. Ben helped her to recover from adversity, to save her position and family. It is very nice of him to offer a possibility of being buried together, as there is a lot of place near his wife's grave. But fortunately it is not necessary in the end of film."
" Funny and touching movie
",0.4404,0.9649,2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"How great it is to watch a movie about a second life in retirement! Certainly the movie not one person has improved the mood and proved that life doesn't end with reaching retirement age!
A story unlikely, but it's nice to watch a movie about motivation, action, making changes in your life for the better. Added to this is the thread of the tightening relationship between the main characters (between the intern and the boss). You can see how Jules's approach to people changes under the influence of contact with Ben.
I highly recommend this movie for long fall and winter evenings!"
" Just Wow
",0.5859,0.8016,2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"What a sweet and pure story, really loved it. I really connected with the actors."
" Break the prejudices
",-0.4215,0.9919,2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"In a nutshell, often our prejudices lead us to wrong conclusions about people. This film is excellent evidence of my words.We're introduced with a retired man, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), who's not actually lose interest in life, even after becoming a widower. In his 70s, he's still smiling every day, open for new activities, making connections with people, staying polite and conservative.One day, Ben seizes the senior fellowship opportunity in trendy fashion agency. He's sure that this's exactly what he needs: creative atmosphere, challenging tasks, ability to help others. But he's facing with prejudice from the side of colleagues. Nobody expects from old guy any awareness about clothes industry, nobody wants to spend their time with boring retirees. This is tough obstacle, but not for Ben. He understands such the common beliefs and just tries to help the firm doing his best. Ben, ex VP of phone book printing agency, has a great experience in business, and all his efforts happens to be extremely valuable in the fashion office, where everybody is in a hurry. Ben easily makes a rounds with his new co-workers and show his sensitivity and desire to cooperate with anybody who needs the help. So, main character refuted all the claims against old people's inability.Personally, film is impressed me. I've already forgotten when I last time have seen such a kind and genuine movie. ""The Intern"" teaches us a lot: about good affairs with people, positive attitude to yourself, fairness, honesty, openness and full house of other things that we should never forget in our lives.Probably, one of the most important takeaways from this film that person's true essence is inside and for that reason we could be dead wrong with our prejudice."
" An interesting and cute movie for relaxation and positive emotions
",0.9136,0.989,2020-11-02 00:00:00,8,"""The Intern"" is an interesting and cute comedy movie. It identifies at least two problems of social inequality in the modern world - inequality of young and old people in employment and gender inequality. The movie tells the story of a pensioner who, after the death of his wife, does not want to live to retire, but wants to work.
Using the example of the protagonist, it is shown that there are provided equal opportunities for people of any age - he gets a job as an intern in a developing online clothing store. After a short time, having adapted his many years of experience in a newspaper factory to modern requirements, he becomes an assistant to the owner of the company, a young woman.
The company is developing rapidly and has many orders and it's ruled by young woman. The movie emphasizes that she has a family, that she is not an arrogant person, and that she doesn't live on the dole. All this suggests that any woman can work hard and support a family, that everyone has equal opportunities, regardless of gender. Separately, it should be noted that in the movie, the heroine's husband is sitting with the child, which also emphasizes equality in determining roles in the family.
Finally, it should be taken into account the movie, in pursuit of a happy ideal world of equality, skips an important, in my opinion, detail - it practically does not show how ""the intern"" misses his wife. On the one hand, it means that anyone can always start life from scratch, regardless of age. On the other hand, it is a sad element of the movie that was sacrificed to create a positive picture."
" A nice light-hearted film
",0.4215,0.9292,2020-10-28 00:00:00,7,"Robert De Niro does something for a change and stars in a warm fuzzy watch in The Intern. A man, who was once high in power, takes a lighter position for a company where he has to work under Anne Hathaway's wing. He has seen the world of work and as the movie goes he tries to provide inside to Hathaway. What starts out as a rocky relationship becomes a bit deeper and eventually settling.Seeing De Niro in a movie that's not nominated for an academy can come with its risks, I don't like Bad Grandpa, and Little Fockers is a disaster, but his charming sense and whit really works for this. And if it was anyone else in his role for this movie, it may not have been the same experience at least through my eyes.I'll mention Anne Hathaway quickly who thrives in com-drams. She's a good actor and she worked out very well for this role.There was one point in the movie I didn't like very much, mostly because I found it to be extremely unrealistic. It involves Hathaway and her husband, and it's not what he does to her but rather the conclusion they come to about the problem. That sub-plot could've and should've had a different outcome. It doesn't ruin the movie but I would've preferred a better outcome for said scenario.De Niro and Hathaway will keep your attention.Solid 7."

" Sweet movie with a crucial fault.
",0.0772,-0.5153,2020-10-18 00:00:00,5,"Since most of the reviews I've seen takes care of the plot, I think I'll have a stand alone opinion in what is wrong in this otherwise super cute movie.When you use an actor like Anne Hathaway. I mean, maybe one of the most beautiful actresses there is.
Alright we know we shouldn't judge by how people look, I am going to do it anyway. Because there is a glaring difference between Jules and her husband, as much as it isn't believable.
Alright, people can have their charm, but to have that charm you need to sell it. He didn't sell it at all, I never found him charming or warm, or had any sort of relationship with her. He also cheated on her, which is in fact for many men and women out there is not forgivable. Yet she forgave him for sleeping with some parent in their kid's school within 90 seconds of his pathetic excuse of an apology.We as viewers don't know this man, all we know he isn't good looking, he cheats, lies, go out of his way to have an affair. How am I as a viewer accept his apology and for her to accept it so easily? We can't! We don't know this man, what makes him special?
It is a base for a good story. Sadly the writers got too lazy at the end.
5/10 for ruining something that could be forgiven, if written well."

Needless to say, acting and expressions of Robert De Niro & Anne Hathaway was too good. Need to thank the director for giving us the glimpse into how online fashion startups work, so learnt a business lesson there. Overall, it's a perfect Saturday night movie!

He was assigned Intern for Jules. But Jules doesn't liked work with older people. But She is a hard-working person and Ben respect that. He worked with smile and energy in this workplace and Jules likes his honesty and share her life hard and tough time with him..and finally she accepted him as her Intern.. story is more than my views. You will love it."
" Mood lightning, cheerful and real- A must watch
",0.5423,0.9964,2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,"It's a great watch and unusually real. You can easily relate to the characters specially if you've ever in life been an intern, you'll feel the nostalgia when you see Robert de Niro's Ben Whittaker all lively and pumped when he's selected as a senior-intern under Anne Hathaway's Jules Ostin. Like every newbie at work, although he is not, he longs to get some tasks and help his mentor in every way possible. In the beginning you pity the 70-year-old retired and widowed Ben for being slightly neglected or ill-treated by the workaholic, passionate, never tiring, ambitious and successful Jules, but that is short lived and He wins her confidence and heart in a couple of days.The whole movie revolves around Ben's life and how he cheers up everybody around him all the time with his cuteness and wisdom. The actors have done very decent work and you can easily gel in the movie and feel the life in it. The music too is very jovial and sets your mood from the first minute of the runtime. The movie presents some very important aspects of the society in a very subtle yet effective way like how a woman is prejudiced at work or as leaders, how the new generation boys in the pursuit of being cool no longer remain a gentleman, marriage life problems etc. A pinch of comedy here and there adds up to the fun content, and a few personal life tensions of Jules balances it very beautifully and how She comes out of it is remarkable and worth taking lessons from.Overall a very good watch if you're looking to uplift your mood (which is always, because that's why people turn to movies)."
" You will be surprised for sure
",0.4939,0.802,2020-07-20 00:00:00,10,"I just thought of watching a feel good film and lord did this one feel good....I was smiling every second of the film. De Niro is a pure genius. He acts like a boss in this one and his emotional reach is unbelievable. On the other hand, Anne surprised me with her performance. I thought she will do good but hell she was extraordinary. I will remember her every time I see a female CEO. This was a great watch."
" The actors/tress did their job, but the Director is another story.
",0.0,0.969,2020-07-17 00:00:00,4,"I believe you can write a mediocre story, but if you have top rating actors you can attempt to cover the flaws. The big problem is that the flaws of this movie are not within the main story but with the secondary ones. Robert and Anne story is beautifull with some scrtipt flaws, that we will speak of later but lets begin with tertiary characters first.Cameron, has an identity crisis. Who is he? I had some posible asumptions during the movie, I thought, is he the villain? Is he trying to plot with the CEOs to take over the company? Is he secretly in love with Jules? Andrew Rannells, Also you can remember him as the evil band member in How I met Your Mother series, which fits perfectly becouse he does have a Villain face. The character and Actor do not fit. He is misleading.Jason and Becky. We were introduced with a typical ""Problems in paradise"" plot between this characters. Are they back tocgether? Not?Matt. This character is controvertial. This movie gives the impresion that tries to uphold the views of modern feminism. But at the end of the movie, it all comes down to basic RomCom built up, ""The man, runs to the woman, leaving everything he did aside to keep her"".Jule's Mother. Another crisis without an end. Jule's mother doesn't say ""I love you"" back, the director doesn't seem to have interest in solving that, but does think the realtionship between them is important enough to make a whole scene in the mothers house, to which we don't hear anything else from the mother after the police went to the house.
Fan idea: I hoped Jule's mother was the lady that follows Ben around, but Ben doesn't want anything to do with. That would've been so funny.Sexual Tention between Ben and Jules. When they go to the trip together and they are in the hotel room, Jules offers Ben to lay down in the bed and she says ""Don't worry I'll sit on the couch"". After she doesn't, Ben says, ""I thought you were going to sit on the couch"". Why? That is unnecesary.Paige friend doesn't want to be friends with her. If that was just a filler comment, we could let it through, but it comes back again and again. To the point it gave me the impresion that Paige's friend was the daughter of one of the moms that Critizices Jules. The park scene is just an excuse so Ben can see Matt cheating. But instead of trying to push how Strong and Independant woman Jules is, they could've made Ben comment about parent influence their child to not be friends with paige.Overall I believe this move tries so hard to be unique but it can't separate itself from mainstream. Which ends up being just Awkward. This movie does not have an Identity."
" Fantastic Heartwarming Performance

The Intern really deserves a 10/10 rating, Robert De Niro, and Anne Hathaway play fantastic characters, with De Niro's performance as a elderly retired gentleman being heart warming and Hathaway's performance being quite balancing and nice. The movie provided quality character development and provided a nice reprieve to the outside world. Absolutely a definite watch!"

" A must watch for a dozen good reasons. You wont regret it
",0.6407,0.9571,2020-06-22 00:00:00,10,The Intern - will go down as one of the nicest movies ever made. A movie that speaks about A 70 year old intern played by Robert De Niro (the guy who plays the lead in The Irishman) and a young startup sensation CEO played by Anne Hathaway (the lead on Oceans 11). The difficulties she goes through managing her busy schedules at work. This movie will want you to appreciate your co workers more will make you value the sacrises your family does for u. It will want to make you feel alive. It will show that experience never goes out of fashion.A perfect weekend watch. Can be seen with family and kids

Work is not everything.5: We always need someone whom we can speak our heart out and whose suggestion matters to us and we do follow them.6: We should Respect our parents and listen to them otherwise we need to search other persons whom we can treat as parents.

" A feel good film done well
",0.6124,0.9819,2020-05-28 00:00:00,8,"POSITIVES:1) Robert DeNiro is fantastic. He is so warm and endearing and this really shows the range of his acting ability
2) The film had me engaged throughout. I was smiling throughout most of the film and then when the emotional moments came I felt them too
3) The character relationships between DeNiro and everyone at About The Fit really do warm the heart. His relationship with Hathaway really is a friendship of equals, but then he also adopts the father figure role to the rest of the interns and seeing them start to dress like him etc was a great touchNEGATIVES:1) The score sometimes ventures away from 'feel good' and becomes a bit too 'cooky' for me
2) If I was being really strict, the film could have been more streamlined without the romantic elements. DeNiro's romance and Hathaway's romance ultimately wouldn't affect the film that much if they were taken out
3) A pet hate of mine is when films have driving scenes in which there is a blatant CGI background and the characters are blatantly not actually driving a car"

" Amazing movie
",0.5859,0.9991,2020-05-09 00:00:00,10,"The Intern is a comedy film, released on 2015. Directed by Nancy Meyers.The main characters of the film are the Academy Award winners Robert De Niro (Raging Bull, Silver Linings Playbook) and Anne Hathaway (Les Misérables, The Devil Wears Prada).The film told us the story of Ben Whittaker (De Niro) a widower of 70 years old and a retired man, who wants to keep his life and mind busy, he travel, he learned new languages, he takes yoga classes, he goes for walks and tried his best to make a busy life, anyway he keeps feeling like something is missing in his life, like he could do more and be more. Until one day, he found an ad for Senior Internship Program at a fashion agency, he made a video to apply for the internship. The agency hires him and his position will be assistant to the young founder and director Jules Ostin (Hathaway).The story keeps telling us how Ben develops at the work, how difficult is for him to adapt to a new age of young workers, how traditional he is but at the same time the energy he has and how much he wants to learn about everyone and help in anyway he can; the film also show us how free is Jules for work, how dedicated she is and passionate are for the agency that she created. The film show us how the relationship between Jules and Ben develops, how little by little they started to connect as friends, as co-workers .It is an amazing film for me, the story has everything that a comedy should have, the music is amazing, the cast made an incredible work, the writers have created a beautiful story about a talented woman and how her life changed thanks to an incredible man who the agency gave the opportunity to make part of a work team, no matter the age. The film really keeps you exciting, it is very interesting, funny and all the film is awesome.If you want to stay at home on a weekend and watch an amazing comedy, you definitely should see this film, because you can enjoy it and don't think about anything else. If you loved Anne Hathaway on The Devil Wears Padra, you will definitely love her on this film and De Niro makes a terrific work on this comedy, very different to all the kind of movies he has made, but you will be surprised of how good he is. Hope you liked as much as me."

Is there anything this man can't do? Really, from jimmy conway to a retired widower restarting life as an intern. What a gem. And never do you feel sorry for him, há doesn't act like a victim, there's no putty party, he takes it as it comes and does the best out of every situation. A bit sappy but wouldn't we all be better people if we could do the same? The supporting cast is great, I consider Anne Hathaway supporting in this, because it is Mr. De Niro's delightful, intelligent and never ""hamming it up"" performance that makes this nothing into something great. Highly recommend. Keep an eye on him. He never over plays it. What a gentleman."

It was better than some of the films DeNiro undertakes these days, but could have done with a stronger plotline with a little more realistic grit and more faceted characters. I must admit I wanted Ben to have more impact at the company - maybe be in an 'equally shared role' CEO with Jules?."

",0.4374,0.9924,2020-02-28 00:00:00,8,"First off I wanted to start by saying this movies genre is not the typical type I usually lean towards. When it comes to Hathaway movies Love & Other Drugs is the first one that comes to mind as a favorite. Anyways being a big movie watcher. On I have always rated watched movies & TV shows but up until recently have never left written reviews. Well being a big fan of both Hathaway and DeNiro. I was surprised in 2020 that I had not seen this movie.Sometimes when I'm having trouble finding something to watch, one way I find something is I will look up one of my favorite actresses or actor and watch a movie starring them. Now it was a bonus finding a movie relating to the genre I needed to watch. With all the cruel people I have been forced to deal with lately it felt good watching ""The Intern"". The chemistry that DeNiro & Hathaway bring to the screen is a breath of fresh air!Loved the plot and how even though this is a work of fiction. I just love how DeNiro uses many now obsolete norms of the past in a modern hipster style tech setting. I think this movie would be a good pick to watch on nearly any occasion. If you have a partner or children who stare at their cellphone screens like robots this is a must watch. If you want some pointers on how to be a gentleman this is a must watch. If your just looking for a feel good movie this is a must watch. Well I hope this was some help. Good Day!"

It was entertaining and gave me only positive emotions (and believe me, I get annoyed very easily). I didn't even mind the slightly feminist tone it took.

" If you're looking for an easy watching and sincere movie
",0.6808,0.9979,2019-10-16 00:00:00,10,"'The Intern' is a comedy/drama movie, which was directed by Nancy Meyers in 2015. The movie takes place in Brooklyn, New-York. The first thing, which attracted me, was the cast - Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro as the main characters. This duo seemed to me quite curious, so I wanted to find out what the plot is. Another reason why I decided to watch it was the place. A lot of movies and series are made in New-York, and I like when a movie contains breathtaking views of this city. As for me, it makes movies truly esthetic.'The Intern' is a story about Ben Wittaker (Robert De Niro), who is 70 years-old. He has a family (son and grandchildren), which live quite far from him, and he's a widower. He has plenty of time and desire to do something new. Ben finds a vacancy in online-store of women's clothes. There he becomes an intern, and his duty is to help Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a young woman who runs this business. I think, the most fascinating thing about the plot is relationship between Jules and Ben. She's young and not experienced, he's wise and he has rich background in business. No matter, they have a huge age gap, they become good friends. Ben supports Jules, not only when it's about work, but in her private life. Jules's family is about to fall apart, and she thinks, if she hires a new director, her family will be fine again. It's a choice between her work, which is extremely important for her, and her family. What should she do? Can this decision save her relationship with her husband? It's a tough decision, but with Ben's help she makes a right one.'Experience never gets old'. This is the general idea of the movie. I guess, it means that experience's always needed, it's always modern and it's always useful, no matter, what sort of experience it is. I love this idea and this movie in a whole. It's so kind and also dramatic. Acting makes you laugh, cry and then laugh again. Especially the very last scene makes you feel so calm and peaceful, and that'll be your emotions after watching the whole movie. I've seen 'The Intern' about 6 times, and every time characters make me relive these feelings.I think, if you want to watch something easy, warm and heartfelt, you should certainly watch this movie. 'One of my favorite movies this last year was Nancy Meyers' The Intern. They're not considering that for the Oscars even though I think Robert De Niro gave one of the best performances this year in that movie. I thought the script was actually one of her best', said Quentin Tarantino and added that it's Oscar-worthy."

" Did De Niro intern ""The Intern""?
",0.0,0.95,2019-09-16 00:00:00,4,"""The Intern"" (2015) written and directed by Nancy Meyers I thought was a much weaker film than some of her excellent earlier work such as ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""It's Complicated"".First off, I thought Meyers had problems settings the stage for the premise of the film, particularly in terms of the company run by Jules (Anne Hathaway). More than that, I was not enamored by her performance.I think Ben (Robert De Niro) was a slightly strange casting call to play the retired cute guy. Because he is De Niro he still nailed it, but I just prefer him as his usual alpha bad-ass character. He might actually have been interning for this part originally intended for Morgan Freeman. Furthermore, his relationship with Fiona got off a little strange but cute as well.Still, the film had moderate entertainment value, although it was very predictable. All in all, I thought it was a relatively weak achievement by Meyers, especially compared with her earlier excellent work."
" My Review!
",0.0,0.902,2019-08-29 00:00:00,8,One of the most beautiful simple story movies ever. Loved the classic role of Robert De Niro. A family kinda movie. Do watch it. :)
" Sometimes reality check does not work, still an entertaining movie
",0.4404,0.9856,2019-08-18 00:00:00,7,"After watching the first third of this movie, I prepared to write a quite negative review about it. I wanted to say that obviously, noone from the writers crew has ever worked in a company: appointments are never sent per usual email; there is NO paper in an office of an e-commerce company; CEO of a company would never cry in a meeting, no matter if a woman or a man; chauffeur and personal secretary for a boss of a company with only few hundred staff members, seriously? I can hardly imagine a guy as smart as Ben, being team lead for years and not able to switch on a computer; and last but not least, there are never so personal discussions in a working place, constantly addressing the feelings of everyone.However, after watching more of this film, its charm got more and more to me. The chemistry between the main characters is great, it is well acted and the story became even more moving.Still the ending bothered me somehow - does someone find it truly realistic that Jules' husband suddenly realizes how wrong his behaviour was and all his feelings leading to this behaviour disappear? And that Jule will feel good from now on coming home late and knowing her husband is spending a lot of time with the ladies where he found his affair previously?Nevertheless, still this movie is fun to watch (it has some really good jokes), entertaining and made with love. I also found its message about empowering women very appealing and topical. I would recommend it, if you don't want to take it too seriously."
" Quite boring
",-0.3804,-0.4019,2019-08-17 00:00:00,3,Easy to watch however that's the problem. I've been watching it for 2 weeks no and I keep putting it on and after 20 minutes I get distracted as is has no real depth to draw me in. Ended up reminding me of 'the internship' which is 10x better in many aspects. So I once again paused the intern to watch a full 2 hours of something else which confirmed to me that I just need to give up trying.
" You won't regret watching this!
",0.3867,0.9783,2019-08-02 00:00:00,10,"When I see ""heartwarming"" in the film description I carefully avoid the title as it usually stays for ""your bowels will float out of your body with boredom"" ""attention: silence interlaced with nonsensical babbling in artistic sceneries"" , ""women pretending to be best friends at some countryside"", ""characters so insipid you will feel sick"" and ""cheesy happy ending alert / no idea for ending at all"" .
This film however, is SO MUCH DIFFERENT than a typical mawkish comedy-drama: ingeniously played, authentic, unobvious and naive just in the right dose. I savoured every single minute of it and it was definitely the most positive thing I have watched for ages!
The Intern is an instant day- maker and a true heart-warmer that urges you to be happy with life, act nice to people and become a better person for at least a couple of hours.
Great job!!"
" Amusing
",0.3818,0.9484,2019-07-22 00:00:00,7,"A lot amusing indeed. A seventy year old man ( Robert De Niro does a great role) tired of being retired with no aim in life decides to stand as a candidate intern in a fashion online company run by a demanding woman. He is accepted and and becomes the assistant of the company's owner and director. Being a nice, wise and helpful man he soon is in everybody's good graces including his director being not only useful for her in business matters but also her personal and private advisor. They soon become friemds. The whole story is told smoothly making a very entertaining slight comedy.very pleasant to follow."

Though sometimes, it doesn't hurt seeing a perfect mentor to our ever-so-stressed Jules.
Ben's perfection, maturity and finesse in handling things actually allows the film to focus more on the Jules' plotline, adding little to his own character arc, which might iritate some, just barely.The humor is just adequate, not slapstick, just subtle chuckle-humor, perfectly complementing the lightheadedness of this flick.Turn on the AC, bring your family, take out that beer from the fridge, sit-back and get ready to have some quality relaxation time."

Nancy Meyers really excels at these rom-com movies that make you feel like the characters are believable and the storyline (even no matter how absurd) might actually be believable.Aside from Hathaway, De Niro is a breath of fresh air as a 70-year-old widower who is just trying to figure out life as a retiree. The only negative that I could grasp from this movie is the fact that all the younger people took a page from De Niro's ""experience"" and started molding towards his way of life, but he never reciprocated that behavior. I guess having him sign up for Facebook?As a Workaholics fan, I really enjoyed seeing Anders in a more serious role and he really performed it quite well. Well until he had to cry that is."
" The Intern Will Get You Excited About Working... That's a First
",0.34,0.998,2019-01-16 00:00:00,9,"As I begin to think more about my future and career options, I am drawn to Design and Marketing. In the movie, The Intern, most of the movie takes place in an office setting. This is where the main character, Jules, runs her up and coming business. The setting is what initially got me excited to watch this movie. Even if you aren't all that ecstatic about the business world, i'm sure you will love the movie for all of its other qualities.
The movie opens with a tilt, down from the trees into a park where we first meet the one of the main characters. Ben Whittaker, a seventy-year-old man who is struggling to find meaning in his life. Ben later comes across a flyer that explains an intern position for senior citizens. He wastes no time and applies for the job.
After time goes by we meet the other lead role, Jules Ostin. She is a powerful business women that is 18 months into starting her own company. Ben gets one of the intern positions and is assigned to assist Jules with anything she needs. We soon learn that she is not the easiest person to work for. She is strong willed and believes she must do everything within the company to make sure it's done right. Nobody takes the time to get to know her accept for Ben. Throughout the rest of the movie we see their relationship transform. Not only do the characters develop a connection to one another, the audience finds a love for the characters as well.
Robert De Niro does an amazing job playing the role of Ben. He has been seen in many movies but I have to say that his role in The Intern was very fitting. Ben's relationship with Jules makes for a heartwarming story with some comedy mixed in. The part of Jules has been questioned by some, it is common to feel that her character is putting a poor image on working moms. By the end of the film, Jules fixes this stereotype and establishes a better image for working moms. All around the actors who filled roles in this movie did an outstanding job. The connection and bond on and off the set was very clear, everyone casted in this movie worked very well together.
Looking back over some of the movies highlights I found that the movie The Internship is very similar in many ways. Not just the name but the whole idea and process of the movie. They both have interns that are considered ""old"", the use of technology is very big in both, and both movies came out in very similar eras. With these two movies being so similar people may begin to compare them and rank one lower than the other. As The Intern came out 2 years after The Internship, Nancy Meyers ideas may not have been as original. Nancy Meyers and the director of The Internship, Shawn Levy, are both successful and have created two very popular films.
Without giving away any spoilers, there are many surprises that cause the movie to change direction. These shifts are executed very well through the script as well as the actors cemotion. Once you fall in love with the characters you feel the pain and struggle they go through. Even Though there are many twists that have the audience questioning the future of the characters and the business, the ending leaves you very fulfilled.
So many different aspects of this movie stand out to me as a strength. From the brilliant acting, to the great director, and the stunning quality of setting and costume. This movie is a must see! There is no doubt in my mind that I will be watching this movie again sometime in the near future.
Overall I would consider the plot and story line of the movie to be one of the best I have seen. The popular film director, producer and screenwriter, Nancy Meyers did an amazing job with this movie. I hope you enjoy The Intern as much as I did."
" Robert De Niro Proves to be ""The Right Fit"" for The Intern
",0.3612,0.9978,2019-01-16 00:00:00,9,"My love for Nancy Meyers films was proved true once again with The Intern. With hits like The Holiday, Father of the Bride, and It's Complicated, I was not surprised with the hard work shown throughout The Intern, a comedy-drama film starring Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway.The storyline of The Intern doesn't feel too predictable and contains enough plot twists along the way to keep you guessing. From character shifts to relationship struggles, I couldn't take my eyes off this film. On top of the exciting storyline, the direction and setting also add to the film.The Intern is about Ben Whittaker, played by Robert De Niro, a retired, widowed, seventy-year-old who worked as an executive for DEX One. Ben finds himself bored while living an uneventful, retired life in Brooklyn, New York and after seeing a flyer, he applies and lands a senior intern role for an online fashion website.Working completely online is initially a challenge for Ben, someone who worked for a phonebook company for forty years. The difference in age of Ben and his Co-Interns gives him the opportunity to teach them with his knowledge and experience and they return the favor by teaching him all about Facebook and simple tasks like how to turn on his new work laptop. On top of the technology struggles, Ben is placed to work directly alongside the founder of the company Jules Ostin, played by Anne Hathaway. From the beginning, Ben is warned this task is going to be a tough one but despite the difficulty of the task, he uses his intellectual wit and charm to impeccably fill the role.Robert De Niro never fails to bring laughter to the film as he has done so before in Meet the Parents, Dirty Grandpa, and The Comedian. Aside from bringing laughter to the film, De Niro will continue to warm your heart scene after scene as he takes the extra step to help Jules out both in and out of the office.Not only does De Niro perfect his role, but Anne Hathaway as Jules Ostin is nothing short of spot on. Jules Ostin was a stay at home mom before being inspired to create an online shopping website centered around the difficulty behind finding ""The Right Fit"" in clothing. Hathaway embodies this role with great passion as she promotes women in the workforce while also standing firm in her role at her company when they are contemplating bringing in an outside CEO.Although the film portrays moms in the workforce, like Jules Ostin, as very hardworking, the film also gives off the vibe that working moms are not able to also be good moms. This may come off a bit harsh and unappealing to working moms who view this film and I believe that Meyers, a working mother herself, could have done a better job avoiding this.Each scene of the film has been long thought out and carefully staged and filmed. In one particular scene, subjective point of view through the eyes and ears of Jules was used as she observes the objects in bathroom surrounding her. Following this shot there's a straight cut to Matt in the bedroom on the other side of the door. The remarkable angles and shots bring a variety of emotions to the viewer without the use of words throughout the entire scene.The Intern exemplifies the idea over and over again that we all have something to learn from someone else. As Jules and Ben continuously learn and grow with each other throughout this film, so will your desire to keep on watching and unveil the outcome of Jules predicaments."
" CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10)
",0.6514,0.9952,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"The stage curtains open ...Wanting to find purpose in his life again, retiree Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) applies for a senior intern position with an aggressive and ""happening"" fashion company. As fate would have it, he becomes the intern of the company's founder and executor, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). Although she is skeptical and aloof at first, Ben's old fashioned ways and honesty win her over during a crucial time in her life, both professionally and personally. These polar opposites soon find out that true friendship can come from the least likely sources. And that a handkerchief, when offered at a tender moment, can mean all the difference in the world.I absolutely love this movie. It is down to earth, realistic and has a lot of heart. Anne Hathaway just seems to get better and better with each movie, and she is in top form here. She was endearing in her role and convincing. Robert De Niro is ... (well, what can you say?), Robert De Niro. Always good. The chemistry between he and Hathaway was spot on. Completely believable and entertaining. Rene Russo was also very good in her supportive role as Ben's love interest, Fiona.This is one of those few movies where everything just clicks into place and works on all levels. It has its share of dilemmas and deals with them straight on ... nothing is slighted or made light of. All relationships were treated as important, as they should be - even the cute side story between another intern and Jule's secretary. It showed how anyone, no matter what their age or status, can have an important impact on our lives. How we should take notice and appreciate them for what they do and who they are.I highly recommend this movie. It has become a fast favorite and I will be watching it again."
" A Rather Unique Relational Movie
",0.0,0.9385,2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"22 October 2015. Robert DeNiro and Ann Hathaway star in this dramatic comedy about an elderly intern to an e-business executive. Directed and written by Nancy Meyers, The Intern offers up an entertaining and finely balanced movie about growing older, about females balancing business and personal responsibilities at home, and about close relationships in general. It is an engaging look at contemporary life and the human element that we often take for granted. The Intern is hard to rate because it's much more reflective of life than the dramatic stylish script the audience and critics have often come to expect. Nancy has incorporated intense, sensitive dramatic scenes which derive from the natural human state of existence rather than the oftentimes overly dramatic scenes for audience reaction. The ending of this movie is a case in point, it doesn't end with explosive titillating satisfaction, but with a soft landing of the expected natural consequences of life trying to work itself out.This movie resembles coming of age comedy-dramas like Uptown Girls (2003) or Waitress (2007) but for the elderly with somewhat older established women. There is also some suggestive elements that could even come from the Best Oscar classic Roman Holiday (1953) with its primary emphasis less on the romantic comedy than on the experience of everyday business life, such as Ann Hathaway experienced in own her breakout film The Devils Wears Prada (2006). What's remarkable is that The Intern reflects one of the few movies that doesn't focus on a romance plot and instead uses another relational theme as the movie's core and still is able to captivate and move the audience, a rare and difficult accomplishment in itself. Even so though, unlike Lost in Translation (2003) the ending doesn't seem to quite able to smooth out the uncomfortable mental ruffles."

I mean, I was expecting Something. But what I got was only a little better than nothing. Enjoyable almost nothing, you understand, Robert and Anne have never been less than enjoyable, but the drama here is almost inconsequential. At least, I hoped that when something did happen De Niro's character would have something to do with its solution. Not so, the problem (you'll have to look hard to find it) is solved by the two characters themselves with no input from the title character. What we have is a group of nice likeable people being nice and likeable and doing nice and likeable things, but all that happens (SPOILER ALERT, FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE PICTURE) is that Quintessential Type A Anne/Jules is overworked and laid-back Robert/Ben helps her deal with this, occasionally dispensing poils of wisdom to the kids from his 70-year vantage point. That's it. Oh, there's some marriage difficulties that almost become drama but not quite, they're solved without even a discussion. If you're looking for relief from edgy high tension drama like ""Mama Mia II"" or ""Ocean's 8"" this is the picture for you. But you don't get out much, do you?"

" In a word...charming
",0.0,0.9711,2018-06-06 00:00:00,7,"Like most of you, I did not make it to the movie theaters in September, 2015 to catch the Nancy Meyers ""fish-out-of-water"" comedy THE INTERN about a 70-ish man (Robert DeNiro) who goes to work at an Internet Start-up company headed by a a driven Millennial (Anne Hathaway). It seemed that this film was just going to be another Robert DeNiro phone-it-in ""paycheck"" comedy and not worth our time.Boy, was I wrong.In a word, I would call this film...charming. Hathaway is charming, the other workers and Interns at the start-up are charming and DeNiro (believe it or not) is the most charming of all.Starring as Ben - a widower who is just withering away with inactivity and boredom who decides to go back to work - DeNiro shows he ""still has it"". His Ben is a strong character, as nuanced as one can be in this type of film and...yes...EXTREMELY charming. DeNiro most definitely is NOT phoning this one in - he gives it a very good effort (maybe not A+, but...) and it shows. He is on screen for almost every scene and holds our attention throughout.Proving to be a worthy partner in this film is Anne Hathaway's driven Internet sensation, Jules. She spars with DeNiro throughout and the two make a fun pairing.Also joining in on the fun is Rene Russo as a masseuse (and love interest for DeNiro and Andrew Rannels as Jules' ass't. But it is the trio of Adam Devine, Zack Pearlman and Jason Orley that almost steals this film as 3 knuckleheads that work with - and are mentored by - DeNiro's Yoda-like Intern. I almost would have preferred to see a film about these 4.Nothing in this film is revolutionary or new and Director/Writer Meyers keeps it that way. It's like pulling on an old, comfortable sweater or a really well worn-in pair of shoes. It won't win any awards, but it is fun..and, yes...charming just the same.THE INTERN is now streaming on NETFLIX and AMAZON PRIME, if you are looking for a...I'll say it one more time...charming...way to spend an evening - look no further than here.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

Ben's wife passed away some time ago and his return to the workforce reminded me to get up and face the day after my own husband's passing. I also enjoyed his etiquette which he shared with the young men who were his co-workers. I felt that if Emily Post had a brother, it would be Ben Whittaker. Since the first time I saw this film I've watched it at least 5 more times. Thank you to the cast, crew and their families for making this film possible."

I was reminded how completely charming Anne Hathaway is, even if the premise had echoes of The Devil Wears Pravda. DeNiro is quiet and understated, so much so that you wonder if a Goodfellas moment is around the corner, but thankfully it's not. There could have been more about the other senior interns for something inside from comic relief, but otherwise a very watchable movie.Anne Hathaway is adorable in it, did I mention that?"
" The Intern: Exceeded my expectations
",0.0,0.9807,2018-04-30 00:00:00,6,"So I had no interest in The Intern, at all. The only reason I ended up watching it was because I was cooking in the Caribbean and needed a time out in a beautifully air conditioned room.Now I like Hathaway, I think she's a competent actress but I very very rarely get to see her in anything as she is a very niche actress and only tends to do the kind of movies I go out of my way to avoid.With her and DeNiro I expected at least strong performances and I got them and a lot more on top. The ludicrous plot plays out better than you'd expect, it turns into something beautiful and heartfelt.The Intern is undeniably a sweet movie and it has substance but sadly it also has a number of overwhelming flaws.Now Nancy Meyers is arguably the ""Chick flick"" queen and therefore I haven't seen many of her films. Based on this despite it being a competent little film I don't think I'll be rushing to see anymore.Though full of emotional and thought provoking moments it simply has too much that plays against it and a finale that I had to see with my own eyes to believe.Passable, but I'm not the demographic.The Good:HeartfeltWell madeThe Bad:Questionable finalePlenty of schmultzThings I Learnt From This Movie:I will never understand why so many react like that to infidelity, leave immediatly you silly girls!"

Anne and Robert were great and Nancy Meyers is really proving herself to be quite a fascinating story teller of love, life and its complications.The main characters were pleasantly presented and well handled, while the core of the story still managed to shine through, and not only is that important, but it also demonstrates talent.

" Nice and nicely done.
",0.6908,0.9827,2018-03-23 00:00:00,7,"A retired widower, Ben, starts a new job as an intern in an online fashion retailer company run by, Jules, the workaholic super committed young lady. The two of them get encountered as Ben becomes Jules's personal intern. Following his looks and the way he dressed, Jules thought Ben can't offer much nether to her, nor to her company. So, she gave him the least amount of tasks. Surprisingly he catches her attention after he managed to voluntarily arrange a disk that has been always found unarranged. Subsequently, Ben becomes her right hand who is responsible for each aspect of her life, starting from getting her daughter to and from school, to breaking into her mother's house to delete an email sent to her by mistake from Jules. Eventually, his guidance helps her bringing her life together. 
It's a nice drama/light movie about starting over, and how people could do more regardless their age or problems. However, the journey for Ben, the leading role wasn't much of a struggle. Which brings us to wonder, whose story it was? Ben, or Jules's? Ben didn't do much to blend in, while the effort Jules had to do to amend her marriage, sort things out in her company, and bringing her life together was much in comparison to the challenges Ben went through. He didn't fail, not even once in any of his tasks. He drew a line of wisdom, comfort, and trust through the whole movie, yet, it was a bit difficult to believe. Especially, when he mentioned at the beginning of the movie that he used to call his grandson to ask him what the heck is a USB, but we see him smoothly using a laptop, doing emails, and he even changed from an old SAMSUNG to an iPhone with no much of a struggle. It's a nice movie indeed, that drew a smile and a relief following the happy ending."

Do not expect me that will say this is a love story crap between two of them. This movie is far from that. It is about how an old intern, Ben changes the life of the hardworking & workaholic, Jules together with some emotional drama. I hate to say this but this movie made my eyes to tear for few scenes."

" Good Cast, Terrible Story
",-0.0516,0.972,2018-01-29 00:00:00,4,"At first glance this movie seems like a decent movie but it's really not...Synopsis: A privilege white woman with mommy issues and too much opportunity starts a business off an unoriginal idea (cause online clothes shopping is nothing new), gets sad when she's too successful and starts an inappropriate friendship with an old intern who decided that a life time of working and having the chance to actually retire is too boring in a world where millions of people can only dream of retirement one day and decides to apply to work for said white woman for free.Said woman is riddled with guilt about her success because her spoiled hipster husband stays at home, contributes nothing but minimal parenting responsibility and then decides to cheat because his ego is so fragile that he can't stand his wife being a successful human being. Over the course of a month (or maybe 2?) nothing changes except that said woman stays with piece of child man child after a half ass apology. Old guy who had a lifetime of happiness with his now deceased wife gets a girlfriend because being alone is bad. Ends with Tai Chi session in a park in downtown New York (somehow?) to symbolize how hard life is for white people and sometimes you just need to appropriate Chinese culture to make yourself feel better.Overall, this movie has no substance to it.

But this is niggling as I found much of this both funny and moving and it works as an intelligent exploration of relationships, identity, purpose i.e all the important stuff.

" Good on first viewing, but is somewhat predictable
",0.2382,0.9867,2017-11-23 00:00:00,6,"The Intern is one of director Nancy Myers' better works in the genre, although not the best. It has its moments of bitter heartbreak, internal conflict, and fairy tale ending, but literally none of these evolve around the title character, but the intern's young female boss, played by Anne Hathaway. If you like her, or appreciate her performance, then you'll like enjoy this film, and vice versa. These emotions ultimately fall just short of inspiring, which is a shame. With more character development and a less predictable plot, perhaps it could have been even better. (Although its reception and box office numbers are still very respectable as things stand).I imagine Robert De Niro's character was intentionally designed to stick as close to the wise old man/sweet father-figure stereotype as possible, and in De Niro's case with a perma-smile, and it works in this film most of the time.However, this is also my biggest disappointment with The Intern. De Niro's character is inherently limited for the same reason that it works in the way it does. There is no character arc whatsoever for him in this film. Rene Russo aka his newfound love technically doesn't count, since this little romance subplot was as artificially inserted as they come, and could be seen coming by anyone familiar with the genre from miles away.De Niro started the movie bored with retirement (this boredom not represented in any meaningful way), and he sees an opportunity to work in a new internet company which happens to be located in the same building where he spent his entire working career (little secret revealed halfway through with no consequence). De Niro's character finishes the movie with a girlfriend (Russo), a new close friend/boss (Hathaway), but how is he a different man than when he started? How is he changed? What has he gone through? Next to none.One moment provides a glimmer of hope as De Niro and Hathaway engage in a heartfelt exchange in the hotel room on Hathaway's marital situation, a conversation which makes it plain obvious to the audience that we are at least halfway through Act III now, with one big resolution coming up soon to end the story. Disappointingly, Hathaway's crisis practically solves itself in no time (the cheating Hubby confesses his wrongdoing and begs for a second chance, which Hathaway happily accepts, thus giving the happy ending the filmmakers want to give us in a very rushed manner), De Niro is then back to showing the young-lings the wisdoms of life, teaching tai-chi to his boss who has just gone through a private nirvana and was born again. De Niro is the same man in everyway throughout the film.My other complaint is that the plot twists are all too predictable, or perhaps it's just that I've seen too many similar films and all the usual premises have been done to death in them. The big reveal at the end of Act 1? Turns out the senior intern has a history with the building. The intern is unwanted by the boss, but gradually transforms her opinion of him, even becomes a part of her personal life? This can't be the first film where you've seen a similar plot. The central focus of Act 2? Turns out the boss's home life is far from perfect. How so? A cheating husband, of course. Perhaps I'm complaining too much. Hathaway's performance is stellar, and overall it has been a better than average viewing experience, but I can't see myself wanting to visit this again in future. 6/10 (fresh)"

The relationship that develops between Ben and Jules (Hathaway) is beautifully done, and it proves that even in the modern day, a close relationship doesn't have to be sexual in any way..., and it teaches people, especially modern people how to actually earn respect and organically grow a non-sexual relationship over a period of time, and proves that everything isn't instant gratification and you have to work at things, regardless of how old you are."

" a delight through and through
",0.5994,0.9968,2017-10-20 00:00:00,9,"Robert De Niro is ""The Intern"" in this 2015 film starring Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo, and Anders Holm.De Niro plays a widower, Ben, who isn't satisfied with retirement and applies to be a senior intern in a successful Internet company, About the Fit, run by Jules Osnin (Hathaway), its founder.The very busy and distracted Jules doesn't remember even sanctioning a program for senior citizens and doesn't want her new intern. She has taken all the responsibilities of the firm on herself - it's her baby and she nurtures it. In the beginning, she has nothing for Ben to do. However, that changes when he becomes her driver, cleans off the junk pile desk that drives her crazy, and proves himself the most popular guy in the office. When she is faced with marital problems, guilt over having a stay at home husband and her long work hours, and thinks the answer might be hiring a CEO, Ben is there with support and sage advice. He's also there for the beautiful in-house masseuse, Fiona, who has taken a shine to him, and vice versa.This is a sweet story about what different generations can give to one another, as the kids in the office seek advice from Ben, and they teach him how to navigate the computer. They see a man who wears a suit and carries a handkerchief but has amazing wisdom and business smarts. He teaches them about showing respect - in one scene, one of the workers has to deliver something to Jay Z, and Ben advises him to put on a different shirt and comb his hair. In one hilarious scene, Jules realizes she has sent the wrong email to her mother (one in which she refers to her mother as a terrorist), and Ben leads the reconnaissance mission to delete the email.Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway are fantastic with great chemistry. Jules' daughter is played by JoJo Kushner, a gorgeous child. As Jules' husband, Anders Holm can show different feelings just by his facial expression. The company workers - Andrew Rannells, Adam Devine, Christine Scherer and others are terrific.This isn't a film about culture clash so much as culture melding. There is a Dutch nursing home that offers free rent to students to live there. The result is wonderful. How I wish there were more intergenerational programs like this. The old are like fine wine - it's time to uncork them.Loved this movie."
" Irresistible first half, clunky second half
",0.34,0.9989,2017-09-28 00:00:00,6,"Love comedy/drama when done right, have liked some of Nancy Meyers' previous work, Robert De Niro at his best is one of the best actors of the latter half of the century (evidenced in 'Taxi Driver', 'Godfather Part II' and 'Raging Bull') and Anne Hathaway has also given good performances. So 'The Intern' seemed promising.'The Intern' didn't quite live up to expectations, it could have done more with its timely premise and does have things resolved too easily (the cheating subplot in a nausea-inducing forgiveness/reconsideration speech) and characters written too neatly and cleanly (with Ben being very amiable and irresistibly likable if too perfect, Jules is the only one with any real arc). At its best though, it is easy to warm to and for the first half it was continual engagement that didn't demand too much but did what it said on the tin.What makes 'The Intern' work is the two leads and their chemistry together. De Niro is just a joy in one of his best performances in recent years, while Hathaway is a charming high-flyer with good comic timing, succeeding in allowing character growth to a potentially problematic character. Their chemistry, for such an unorthodox pairing, is so natural and grows warmer without doing it too quickly. Rene Russo is good value though her role is not large while the performances of the colleagues are amusing. The only weak performance with a very flimsily developed and bland character comes from Anders Holm.It looks good, it's slickly shot and edited and the locations and Hathaway's wardrobe are beautiful on the eyes. The direction is mostly controlled and the film goes at a sprightly pace in the first half. The irresistible charm and a script filled with pleasantly amusing lines and small scenes (such as De Niro turning up at the office in a suit, with a calculator and addressing himself, in a way that's very business-like, in the mirror that reminds one fondly of 'Taxi Driver') and wry observations and insight, taking care in making characters as amiable as possible while never fully developing most of them. The story may lack depth and be unsurprising with some dramatic short cuts in the second half but mostly engages and is charmingly frothy and lively.Sadly, things take a downturn in a jarring tonal shift to a clunky second half though thanks to De Niro and Hathaway it's not unwatchable. Really admired what 'The Intern' did in giving Jules an arc and it was interesting to begin with, apart from benefitting from more show and less tell at how good she was at her job and such, but halfway through became awkwardly indecisive. The sprightly, feel-good and very easy to warm to tone of the first half is replaced in the second half by pacing that tends to sag and things taking too much of a melodramatic and schmaltzy tone.For instance the heart to heart/forgiveness scene could have been heartfelt but makes one feel nauseous instead. The wry insights remain but the more sporadic comedic elements don't feel as well timed or placed. As said, Anders Holm doesn't have the same enthusiasm as the rest of the cast and gets lost amidst everything else which does hurt Jules' character arc when she has such a dullard of a spouse. The music score is nothing that sticks in the mind, for music that's pretty repetitive this was a problem.Overall, decent enough film if one of two halves, starting off very well but later mostly goes down south. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
" Cute
",0.4588,0.964,2017-09-26 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)On the surface this appears to be a standard drama sprinkled with bits of humor. But it accedes basic assumptions by having an above average script, dialog and a couple twists and turns. There are even some very funny moments from some very strange looking and well-cast, side characters that help energize the story. The plot is about a fast- moving tech company that hires some senior interns; not seniors in college but old retired people. DeNiro's character may be slow with the tech knowledge but brings a wealth of life experience to the company and the young CEO who struggles to run a company and have time for her husband and child. Amusement swirls around that dynamic. The movie is well-paced, decently developed characters yet does have a few weak plot moments. But overall, it was very entertaining and light-hearted."
" Light, touching and sweet
",0.4588,0.9912,2017-09-19 00:00:00,10,"I became interested in this film primarily because of the light atmosphere represented in trailer. And the duo of Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro seemed promising. Well, the director Nancy Meyers did a great work. ""The Intern"" is a beautiful film with touching story. A story from everyday life, taken to screens, with some special elements, making you smile because of sweet situations shown in film. A story, that kind of tells you not to give up. Light humor only fills this perfect picture. I like good dramas. During watching ""The Intern"", it for some reason reminded me of ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Maybe it's because the film is based on the environment of the fashion industry, or maybe it's because of Anne Hathaway, or maybe even both. But after watching it I can honestly say, that Nancy Meyers's film has something in common with David Frankel's story, only ""The Intern"" is lighter and isn't so severe. ""The Intern"" is a perfect drama, а film that justified absolutely all expectations. A beautifully made story, which I didn't hesitate to give 10/10."
" Better than expected

This film ended turning into a success at the box office, while it was appropriately released at a proper time and had a lengthy stay. The Intern is good due to the cast of its lead and their chemistry throughout. Although predictable, it works well here and the film isn't as soapy or cheesy as one would have expected. Several subplots come into the film in the second half as it deserts itself from another plot, or there may be some plot twists that occur but these things keep the film entertaining and never boring. Overall, the Intern is a solid comedy if you are into these type of films."

Robert De Niro proves (again) that he is a really good all round actor (not just a tough guy actor), and Anne Hathaway is also excellent, if a little 'gushy' (though, to be fair, that gushy-ness is more a reflection of her character than her acting skills).So, it wasn't great, but it wasn't exactly awful either, and if this is the kind of movie that you like then you'll probably love it."

The elderly man plays an important rule to the lady overcome difficulties. The performance of the actor and actress is also good."
" Old fashioned man
",0.0,0.9753,2017-08-10 00:00:00,9,"After I finished watching this movie, I immediately want to make friends with Ben. Robert De Niro is the perfect for the role of him. Ben is gentle and intelligent. He is old-fashioned but become loved by every co-workers Jules, Anne Hathaway, is a entrepreneur and a mother. I laughed at her cycling in the office. She tries to be perfect both in the office and the house. But she gives more weight to the job, so her husband does housework. Still working women are not so popular. It is pathetic that Jules is looked coldly by other mothers. Her effort for balancing work, childcare and marital relations are very tough. She never whines about her job and home, but she only does in front of Ben. He just listens to her without saying nothing. Their relationship is charming. It makes me notice that you can be friends with anybody without regard to age or sex."
" Sweetest Movie Ever Seen!!
",0.0,0.9915,2017-06-30 00:00:00,9,"I must start off this review by saying that this is by far the cutest real life movie I have ever seen! Robert De Niro plays such a kind character who is so wise and helpful in every way possible. And Anne Hathaway was a brilliant CEO who portrays a woman of strength and power. However, this also movie shows the flip side of having a powerful woman running a business and not having much time for her husband. Ben (Robert De Niro) helps Jules (Anne Hathaway) not only with the company but also with her personal life and shows Jules that she can be a powerful CEO of a company without having to lose her position for her husband. He also manages to help almost everyone he meets! He is generally a very lovable character.This movie is a must watch for anyone who wants an easy, relaxing and heart warming plot."

" 1 star
",0.0,0.9184,2017-06-10 00:00:00,1,"Two things struck me about this film as awful. First, for such a huge budget film, did they really have to play the same music over and over and over and over and over again? Wasn't there funding to find someone with a sense of artistry to select better music or at least a wider variety of sounds? Second, the writing was awful and the dialog was idiotic. Wasn't the least bit interested in either of the two lead characters. I would have left before it ended, but we paid full price and I am an optimist: I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't. On the plus side, the sets and wardrobe were nice."
" The Intern Review
",0.0,0.9964,2017-05-31 00:00:00,8,"The Intern is a film written and directed by Nancy Meyers. I had just heard about the film being a good one. I saw no trailers so I didn't know what to expect out of it. After the film finished, I was satisfied. It's basically a slice of life kind of film.Plot: Ben Whittaker, a 70 year old, joins as an intern to Jules Ostin in an online fashion company.Story and Direction: The story is quite simple. We have a man, old and alone, having to do nothing basically, joining as an intern to just make himself busy. Now that's something an old man always faces which is very beautifully shown here. Then we have a contrasting character like Jules, who is very busy and doesn't have the time for almost anything (today's working women). Both of these characters are balanced quite nicely. We also have certain characters of the office which are quite enjoyable. Also we get a sneak peek into Jules' home where she has a husband and daughter, for who she feels she is giving less time due to her job. The most of the story is perfect. I had issues with some things. Like Fiona the massage therapist. Although the character was very little, but still, trying to make Ben and Fiona a pair was kind of making the story go off track. Another thing was the office people helping Jules in one scene of a mistake made by her. I mean, don't we say we should keep our personal and professional lives separate.Performances: Robert De Niro is a great actor and its always a joy to see him. Anne Hathaway was also good as the working woman Jules. Rene Russo as the therapist was also good in her small role. Adam DeVine as Jason was good in his comic portions. Zack Perlman and Jason Owley were good too as Ben's colleagues. Anders Holm had a sincerity in his role.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be where Jules helps Ben open up a Facebook account. And Ben in turn tells Jules about his work. This was basically where I felt the essence of the film lied. The older and newer generation sitting and talking and sharing ideas.Verdict: I had a great time with The Intern. It was a good film. Robert and Anne were great in their roles. Although a few missteps, but the film is still watchable.I am giving it an 8/10."
" For me it was Excellent
",0.5719,0.9914,2017-05-29 00:00:00,10,"For me it was excellent, nothing but a beautiful life lesson with an awesome music track, so incredible well done and socially critical for people of all ages, I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end, no excessively dramatic, nor too intellectually cold, it has a perfect balance between human emotions and reasonable decisions, I so wish my life could be like that, and the relations ships were meaningful but with the proper amount of sensible and sensitive, like the pepper and salt of life, wonderfully paced, my only criticism is that it was lack of details on the problems solutions and follow ups, but they weren't necessary for the message it tried to deliver as far as I can see; in short a surprisingly and refreshing classy, well done, mature movie, executed with excellence, and exemplary pattern to follow for Hollywood."
" Loved De Niro's character more than movie
",0.5994,0.9441,2017-05-27 00:00:00,9,"The Intern is entirely a sweet plot with some more sugar of Ben(De Niro). I liked its character more than its plot spcly the lead. Anne has done a great work in it and relationship between then is just awesome. Ben is a character whom we all want to be in our real life , A loved one who knows what to say and do in the right spot. Though there are some plot holes but its all right. I decided to watch the movie just because of Hathway but when i finished i loved De Niro more in the movie."
" Corporate America needs free Labour
",0.5106,0.6927,2017-05-17 00:00:00,1,"This movie strongly promotes the meme of working for free as an intern (unpaid Labour).I cannot imagine that the older generation will willingly volunteer for menial tasks for no reward especially when they can actually help people rather than just sell crap for somebody else, so I can only imagine that this is just an end run at persuading millennials that working for free is ultimately worth it, because, you know, corporations cannot afford to employ you, or otherwise your parents are rich enough to support you while you ""buy"" an advantage over poorer people who cannot afford to give up their Labour for free! It's interesting to see all the elitist assumptions that are propagated during the film, such as it's okay to take a seat in the back when it's your driver but when it's your intern you should make a pretense of sitting in the front! This film is worth watching provided you 1. Don't pay for it, and 2. Can view it cynically, and use it as a lesson in avoiding both corporatism and elitism.Still as the intern job in the film is related marketing ""fashion wear"" it should be no surprise that his position is unpaid given Labour abuses in this field are the norm.Still it's nice to give work to popular actors who need money, as opposed to young unload actors, while doling out trite, feel-good, fake-nice, trash. Sarc.I have to wonder why this film is so popular given all I've said, but then the reviewers probably aren't the same people working in the garment industry or working unpaid internships, maybe the theme of the film is that America is a very class *unconscious* society where the poor can be ignored, or maybe there is no moral and the writers are simply elitist!"
" Fun uplifting cross-generational film
",0.5106,0.9956,2017-05-07 00:00:00,7,"As a 60 year old guy, I related very well to The Intern. Robert Deniro stars a Ben, a 70 year old widower who wants a job to add something dependable to his life. Ben worked for a telephone book company for 40 years, and he misses that regular rhythm of life. He's got everything organized and set, except he's run out of things to spend his time on.Enter Jules (Anne Hathaway) as the CEO of a startup clothing company. Her focused disregard to details of her life are startling, but she's so focused on making her company successful that she's unable to pay much attention to the details. In short, she's burning out because she's in a bit too much over her head. She finally starts noticing Ben, who gets hired as an intern to connect with older folks, and Ben has a lot to offer because of his strong experience. Ben can relate to everyone, young, middle, older aged folks. He's your prototypical nice guy. It gets hilarious to see some of his interactions with his colleagues, and how he starts having everyone's back because he so has his stuff together.Can he find fulfillment? Can he find new love? Can he save Jules from herself? Go see the movie to discover if all this is possible. My only complaint is casting in the form of Jules' husband. They chose Andres Holm, whom I never heard of. His looks didn't match what I would imagine a match for Hathaway as. His acting was not strong enough, nor believable enough. Otherwise, very strong performances from the other stars.The Intern should leave you smiling and hopeful. I hope you enjoy this film."
" A surprisingly nice movie...
",0.6124,0.9975,2017-04-28 00:00:00,7,"""The Intern"" turned out to be a rather nice surprise of a movie, especially because it was a really good story, and it was helped along quite nicely with some impressive acting performances.The story told in ""The Intern"" is about elderly citizen Ben Whitaker (played by Robert De Niro), a widower who keeps himself busy as retirement proved to be not his thing. And one day he signs up for an internship for the elderly at an online fashion company.What worked out in ""The Intern"" was the storyline and the absurdity of the situation. It is a story that was quite original and funny. But also the very impressive cast that they had gotten together for participating in the movie. Robert De Niro really carried the movie quite nicely and Anne Hathaway also held her own quite nicely here.There was a great combination of comedy and storytelling in ""The Intern"", so writer and director Nancy Meyers really managed to create something memorable and unique here, proving her talent for telling an outstanding story with outstanding characters.""The Intern"" is one of the better Robert De Niro movies in a while, and if you are a fan of him then you should definitely check out ""The Intern"", if you haven't already done so. I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie and it turned out to be a rather good and heartfelt movie. It is the kind of story that sinks in deep and Sticks with you for a long, long time."
" Successful, sweetly observed comedy from Nancy Meyers
",0.8555,0.9977,2017-03-20 00:00:00,9,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Ben Whitaker (Robert De Niro) is a seventy year old widower from New York, who answers a job vacancy for a senior intern at an online fashion agency, run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), in order to give some direction and meaning back to his life. At first, he couldn't look more out of place in the modern open plan, tech savvy work place he now occupies, but his old school ways eventually endear him to his co workers, as well as Jules herself, until Ben becomes her driver and she finds his age and wisdom coming to save her in her personal as well as professional life.The pace of technology over the course of the last forty to fifty years has accelerated to the point that the modern world resembles something of a science fiction movie come to life, and one in which the older generation would understandably feel quite bewildered and overwhelmed by, and this is the inspired premise that Nora Ephron chooses to explore in this gentle, bittersweet comedy, that eschews an old fashioned charm that isn't to be found in many films of the genre these days.In the lead role, De Niro excels as the kindly old widow with advise and wisdom to dispense in droves, in a role with similarities with, but a complete contrast to, his role in the execrable Dirty Grandpa, which actually followed this. While he seemed totally out of place and degraded in that film, this is a part he fits much more comfortably, which suits his personality and talents a lot better, allowing him to create some genuinely decent chemistry with co star Hathaway and the rest of the youthful cast, which works wonders.By creating a genuinely inspired concept and not just nose diving for cheap laughs and crudeness, it's paid off for Ephron and she's created a hugely rewarding and successful comedy that will manage to generate equal appeal to audiences young and old alike. ****"
" A Simple Feel Good Movie....
",0.4404,0.9623,2017-03-19 00:00:00,10,It's a movie which will always cheer you up. The main thing I love about this movie is the simplicity of its story-line. Also the soundtrack is great. Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro gave a really good performance. I've always loved both their works and now this one too.
" ""The meaning of life is your career and your social ascension"" - not my kind of film.
",0.0,0.9001,2017-03-09 00:00:00,3,"I can't say that I didn't like this film.I really like De Niro and Hathaway. But there was something about their characters and the values they promoted that I didn't like . As if everything in life revolves around work and success. De Niro's character had absolutely nothing to do with himself when retired (which indeed happens a lot in real life but this doesn't mean it's not sad). I mean do people get so alienated from themselves they have no idea who they are when they are not working? And they just can't stay in a room with themselves if they don't get some kind of social validation ? That is really sad. As for Hathaway's character, being so ""private"" and suspicious is almost insane. But the worst part was the heart to heart the two of them had near the end of the movie, where he tells her that her career is more important than everything else and if her husband can't cope it's time she let him go. Wow !!! I'm not saying cheating should be excused but the focus was not on her husband's cheating on her during this conversation. The focus was on her career and how that is the most important thing in a person's life and no one should be allowed to get in the way. This is why I say I didn't like the values promoted in this film. People reduced to financial and social achievement... not my cup of tee."
" The Intern is an amusing movie to watch because it takes common scenarios and puts a twist on it,.
",0.3818,0.9898,2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"College and high school students often get internships at companies over the summer to get real, in-the-field work experience. Other times, students get internships as something to put on their college applications, giving them an edge over others. However, in the movie ""The Intern"" by Nancy Meyer, the new intern at the company is an 70 year old retired man. The CEO of this company is a young woman, around age 23, who started the company herself. She believes that she has to do everything at the company and demands to oversee everything. The new intern has his internship at an online fashion store company. Ben Whittaker, the intern, has no idea how to work a computer. He does not have an email, he does not know how to navigate Facebook, much less does he know how to online shop. In Nancy Meyer's movie, ""The Intern,"" it takes common scenarios and twists them to go against stereotypes, making the movie amusing to watch. Ben Whittaker is the 70 year old intern who knows nothing about computers. However, he is still successful in the company because of his proper ways. He teaches the rest of his coworkers the proper mannerisms needed to excel at life and please your boss. Despite not knowing anything about the company, he does small things around the office and helps out the CEO, Jules, to make her day a little simpler. One morning, Ben gets to work extra early to help Jules clean up an extra messy table so she has one less thing to stress about. Ben makes an effort to do all these small things, such as driving her to and from work, which add up to help warm his way into Jules's heart. She eventually accepts him and they become very close friends, to the point that she trusts him with her life. Ben Whittaker goes against most stereotypes because he is a retired man who knows nothing about computers, however, he is still able to make it in the company.Besides Ben, Jules, the boss and starter of the company, also defies stereotypes. She has a child, and her husband is a stay at home husband who does all the cooking, cleaning, and other familial stuff. On the other hand, Jules is a strong, hard-headed woman who believes in overseeing everything and doing everything to make sure it is done. In one clip of the movie featuring the other stay-at-home mothers of the children who go to Jules's daughter's preschool, Ben is talking to the women and the dislike for Jules is obvious, either because they are jealous, or think she does not spend enough time with her child. Once again, Jules goes against most stereotypes that a boss should be a firm, Caucasian man with a stay-at-home wife who does the dishes. The movie ""The Intern"" is very interesting in the fact that it takes common scenes and adds a tweak to make it go against most stereotypes. Watching these different scenes play out also adds a hint of humor into the movie, making it enjoyable to watch. Ben Whittaker is a retired worker who knows nothing about this type of work, defying the stereotype that interns are college students looking for a job. Continuing to defy clichés, the boss of this company is a young woman who has a daughter and stay-at-home husband, going against the stereotype that all CEO's are Caucasian men with trophy wives. Because of the twist in scenario, the movie is able to add humor into it, making it amusing to watch."
" Strong 7
",0.5106,0.9911,2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"I'm very close to the prestigious 8 on this one. De Niro was outstanding. The movie moved us in uniquely 2015-era ways: old-school businessman endorses young working woman's career and becomes her confidant both personally and professionally; working woman deals with stay-at-home dad's infidelity. And older widower finds meaning and potential love in retirement and singleness. The movie clearly tugs at our heartstrings and we willingly go along. The theme music was taken from a dozen similar movies, but gave it a vintage feel and served the movie well. The last 2 minutes were odd. It's hard to end a book or a movie well. About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)."
" Tries to do too much and fails
",-0.4215,0.9924,2017-02-02 00:00:00,5,"A film that is trying to tell too many stories simultaneously, with the result that none is properly explored, or worse, really makes us care about that much. This is a movie about a retired widower coming back to work as an intern in a hip fashion house and the comedy that arises from his old-school low-tech been-there approach to life and the web-wise younger generation colleagues who think they know it all but really have a lot to learn. And, it's a movie about a woman who's built up from scratch a really successful company but is struggling to create the right balance between work and family, her one-time high-flyer house- husband is playing around, her business funders are concerned about the company's rapid pace of growth, and she's considering big conflict choices between what's best for the business and what's best for the family. It's a film about trust, and the need we all have for someone to whom we can open our hearts, on whom we can lean and depend with total confidence that they will never let us down. And it's a film about love and loss and forgiveness and loving again. Yes, it's all of these things and more, and yet not one of them really takes centre stage, the characters never grow credible in any of these scenarios and plot lines; the whole thing is a jumble.And it's riddled with absurdities and clichés that remove any hope of believability or realism. Surprise surprise, this hip company turns out to occupy part of the exact same office building that Robert De Niro once used to work in. Coincidence, eh? The ""reward"" massage that first introduces the Rene Russo character to Robert De Niro is, depending on your point of view, either offensive (male teenage fantasies aside, just imagine if the genders were reversed) or totally implausible. The cheating husband is both a casting bloomer and an almost wholly unbelievable character all the way through. The heart-to-heart chat in the hotel room after the fire - so clunky it really struggles. And the ""funders want to bring in a CEO"" plot device! I mean, is there anyone who knows a thing about business who wasn't shouting ""a COO, not a CEO, a COO is what you need"" at the screen?Could have been great, but really trying to do far too much. And failing."
