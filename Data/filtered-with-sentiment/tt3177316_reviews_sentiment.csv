" End the honeymoon
",0.0,0.1566,2021-03-31 00:00:00,1,Oh my goodness I can't believe I wasted I don't even know how long this movie was of my life. Absolutely stupid. The trailer was cut very well the movie overall explained nothing and left you wondering what happened. This just goes to show that anybody can make a movie but not everybody deserves to have a movie made.
" A glorious pivot from romance to tense body horror
",0.4019,0.9782,2021-03-28 00:00:00,8,"Honeymoon (2014)
This movie starts out very sweet and romantic...almost too sweet. Rose Leslie is just the cutest a person can achieve and then after a bit of newly wedded bliss the weirdness begins. This movie makes a glorious pivot from romantic lake house movie to tense body horror and I really enjoyed it. Great acting, writing and a strong directorial debut by a director I'll be looking out for in the future."
" good,not good enough
",0.4404,-0.8082,2021-03-17 00:00:00,6,"The horror builds up very nicely,i like this kind of coming out of nowhere type of horror movie.but i do like it revealed a little bit more to let us know what the couple dealing with.is it supernatural force?dark evil? alien animal? Cthulhu?
an ""open ending"" doesn't mean ""no ending""."
" Woeful beyond belief! Hot garbage!
",-0.5399,-0.1779,2021-02-26 00:00:00,1,"If you are struggling through lock down and looking for a new film, please skip past this crock of s**t. Worst film I ever saw. Nauseating love via garbage acting for 45 minutes. Followed by 45 minutes of ""horror"". Awful film, I can't say it ENOUGH. I wish I saw my review before I invested time into watching it."
" Effective indie thriller...
",0.4767,0.9124,2021-02-23 00:00:00,7,"...from debut writer-director Leigh Janiak, released by Magnet. Rose Leslie and Harry Treadaway star as a newlywed American couple who decide to spend their honeymoon in a remote cabin in the Canadian wilderness. After a few days of bliss, things take a turn when Treadaway finds Leslie apparently sleepwalking in the woods late one night. She doesn't seem quite the same afterward, forgetting things and with strange injuries on her body. The husband's dread starts to grow even stronger as the wife's condition worsens.I can't reveal too much about the plot as the less known the better. Leslie and Treadaway, both British performers best known for TV roles (she on Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones, he from Penny Dreadful), are good, although I
have to wonder why they didn't cast American or Canadian performers for the American roles. This is a slow-burn thriller, and audiences have to be patient, although I thought the film went on about 10 minutes too long, and it only ran 87 minutes in total, so some fleshing out of the script would have helped. Still, for a debut feature from a new filmmaker, it is notable. North Carolina stands in for Canada."
" Why so many pancakes?
",0.0,0.2225,2021-02-17 00:00:00,3,There are other breakfast foods available. I gave the 3 stars as they included French toast. More variety would have made this a much more believable and enjoyable watch.Also these are the kind of couple that sends out unwanted family Christmas letters and arrange weekly zoom 'parties' with a fancy dress theme. I'd avoid them and this lack of breakfast selection film.Honeybee? More like where's the honey nut cheerios..?!
" Trigger Warning: Extreme scenes of post-marital sex
",-0.34,0.25,2021-02-17 00:00:00,3,"Too much post-marital sex for my liking. Also, any couple that races each other to a restaurant deserves anything bad that comes their way. I liked the pancakes and the plate of Indian food."

" An incredibly underrated indie horror flick
",-0.6077,-0.9013,2020-12-17 00:00:00,8,"I remember this being one of my favorite horror flicks of the year (2014). Incredibly suspenseful, unnerving, purely psychological horror. Fans of the more fast-paced horror flicks may not enjoy this one, but for fans of both slow-moving thrillers and horror, this is a must-watch. You may never look at cabin getaways the same after seeing this one!"
" Slow and boring
",-0.3182,-0.3774,2020-09-06 00:00:00,2,It was very slow. Boring and never explained what was happening.
" Quite dull and weird sexual scenes
",-0.6068,-0.7351,2020-07-12 00:00:00,2,"This movie is quite slow in its buildup. It's quite cliche tbh: a young newly wed cishet couple going on their honeymoon in a remote cabin somewhere. the acting was actually okay and there was a genuine chemistry between the two characters, doesn't feel force or overly dramatized. But the actual scarring sucks lol it's too common of the story. Watching the last 30 minutes for me feels like any other horror ending that I've seen. It was a bit disappointing."
" Pretty Decent and Creepy Flick

" Yawn. Predictable and badly executed
",-0.4767,0.2506,2020-02-04 00:00:00,2,"Movie is sooo slow... Basically nothing happens throughout the movie. And the story about newlyweds crazy in love like teenagers is just. Uhhh. Ok we get it, they love each other, why making it so annoying, couple of scenes would be enough, but noo, they keep bombarding us with sex and stupid trashy dialogs. It supposed to be a mystery, but I could tell right away from the first ""scary"" scene what was all that about (worse than I expected actually) . Skip it. Don't waste your time."
" Almost
",0.0,0.8683,2019-11-26 00:00:00,7,"A very good film and so very nearly brilliant. Both leads, as is mentioned by most reviewers, are outstanding. Managing to extract as much out of the script as humanly possible, one of those rare films where performance outshines the given material to the point of making the script redundant. I would like to see them together again. You will have to invest in this film, it won't spell things out for you, but if you like a slow burning, tension ratcheting, claustrophobic, disturbing and ultimately still unresolved outcome then this might be a film for you. My only complaint about this movie is that the denouement arrives suddenly and rushes to its conclusion much too quickly, letting down a lot of the good work up that point. Nevertheless a good watch."
" So good
",0.4927,0.9423,2019-11-04 00:00:00,8,"Really so good!! I was so pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie! Suspenseful, very well acted, and I couldn't guess what was going to happen (which is so rare).

",-0.5267,-0.9809,2019-09-05 00:00:00,1,"This was the second worst horror movie I have ever seen, second only to leatherface. If you gave this movie more than two stars then you probably like sitting through 4 hour math lectures. Was this a parasite attack, aliens, hell maybe it was something paranormal? I just watched and I am in utter confusion. I was so upset I made this account purely to warn everybody on the planet that this is a waste of two hours. I looked up the movie rating... 5 stars????? WHAT ARE WE DOING GUYS. If this is our standard for horror movies I'm never watching one again. I honestly think telletubbies has a stronger plot line than this disaster."
" Lackluster...
",0.0,0.7417,2019-08-31 00:00:00,5,I just watched this movie on Hulu. I had never heard of it and didn't realize it has been out awhile. The trailer looked promising! But unfortunately this one turned out to be a dud unless you like open ended movies with no closure/answers. If a movie isn't a good story answering The Who what when where why and how.... I'll pass. It would've been nice to at least be thought provoking and open for some interpretation but I saw nothing. It had potential to be a great movie but it seems like the writers fell asleep every ten minutes
" Good Until the End
",0.4404,-0.8275,2019-08-05 00:00:00,4,"I would have given this movie 8 if it had a better. honestly, I am sick and tired of horror films that build up a mystery, only to never solve the mystery. This was a promising movie. I was hooked into it. There was an intriguing mystery and clues were thrown all around.And for what? An ending with almost NO explanation at all. This is so freaking cliche now. I am sick of horror movies doing this. We want to know why these things were going on. We do NOT want to always have to write the ending on our own. That is the screenwriter's job. But people nowadays make films without and ending that explains what was going on.Ambiguous endings have their place, no doubt. But only when the clues that came before it are meaningful to the end. Here they are not. It was lazy and the ending invalidated the whole movie."
" Good Mystery

",0.3818,0.9267,2019-06-13 00:00:00,6,"Respectable slow burn in a pretty setting. It keeps its cards close to its chest but throws us a bone toward the end.They could have been even more subtle, which is ultimately why it's a good movie rather than a great one, but its distinct, restrained rhythm lets it hold its head up high again so much trash in this subgenre."
" Creepy, and NOT predictable
",0.0,0.9,2019-06-11 00:00:00,7,"I thought this movie was going to be dumb. But I was very pleasantly surprised. It's not the movie I thought it was going to be. I HIGHLY recommend watching. Even if you think you know what's happening, you can't predict the ending."
" Not Much Payoff
",0.0,-0.8019,2019-06-05 00:00:00,6,"Continuing in my long list of movies I chose to watch from Game of Thrones actors over the last month or so, 'Honeymoon' stars the always fantastic Rose Leslie as 'Bea' the troubled half of a newlywed couple whose honeymoon certainly doesn't go as planned. First off, who thought that having your honeymoon in the woods in the middle of nowhere was a good idea? I understand the desire for privacy and the ability to be secluded from everything else in life but this plot felt avoidable if they only picked a more common destination. Alas, we have Honeymoon, the slow-building, bloody, gritty, and ambiguous horror film that doesn't quite have the payoff that the premise initially makes a promise to deliver on. But still, a more than watchable, well-acted film from director Leigh Janiak.6.3/10"
" It's upsetting
",-0.4767,0.6758,2019-05-25 00:00:00,1,I just watched this for Rose . But this movie really disappointed me. As an actress she did her best. I suppose the story was not that good. This is an honest review from my personal perspect. I don't want to undermine nobody 😔
" A unique take on an often filmed concept, each generation having their own version of the film reflecting the era they were made.
",0.0,0.944,2019-04-25 00:00:00,8,"My spoiler free review for The Bloody Asylum that can be found at WordPress, Mr Geeky blog:This is the directorial debut of Leigh Janiak, who co-wrote the very well written screenplay. Since Honeymoon she has gone on to direct two episodes of Scream: The TV series, has two films now in production, and is also working on a sequel to the 90s classic The Craft. She is also the wife of Ross Duffer co-creator of Stranger Things.Honeymoon is elevated by the performances of its two main actors. Rose Leslie, known for her role as Ygritte in Game of Thrones, and Harry Treadaway, who many will recognize as Victor Frankenstein from the TV series Penny Dreadful. A unique take on an often filmed concept, each generation having their own version of the film reflecting the era they were made. The first being released in the late 1950s. To say much more will ruin the effect of what follows as the film unfolds, because it is a film that is best watched with little or no prior knowledge.For the most part it is character driven. It follows a newly wed couple as the title suggests on their honeymoon. The film begins as what seems a pretty generic romantic comedy set-up, but that is very much purposeful. This is so as to ground the unfolding events and make the audience engage with the characters. Gradually as the story unfolds it becomes far more of a psychological horror. The entire film is almost a two-hander, with Rose Leslie and Harry Treadaway giving very impressive and convincing performances from the very first scenes to the last.The combination of cinematography, sound, music and assured direction helps to add to the building tension and dread throughout the film. For those with eagle eyes there are references to many genre films, but they are very subtle.On the strength of Honeymoon Leigh Janiak is a name to remember and I am very intrigued to see her future projects."

I was hoping the answer was going to be more interesting but when all you have are a bunch of disjointed, freaky behaviour the only answer you have is aliens because you don't need to define otherworldly ambitions.

" Seriously bad. Really bad.
",-0.8271,-0.9626,2018-12-04 00:00:00,1,"Bad acting. Bad writing. Bad directing. I can't comprehend how this made it to SXSW. How much can we take of the lead actress saying over a hundred times, some combination of ""I don't know"" and ""You don't understand""? Apparently, a full movie's worth. The audience, at the end of this movie, won't know and not understand. A mysterious light in the woods. A mysterious male-looking outline. A mysterious childhood friend who we meet as being very angry (with a mysterious reason of that particular emotion). A mysterious set of blood marks on her legs. A mysterious creature in her womb. A mysterious stabbing of her genitals (with no apparent ramification). A mysterious ""aging"" of her skin. A mysterious connection to another mysterious female. A mysterious reason why she's losing her memory? A mysterious ""I'm trying to protect you"" and then killing him. The entire thing is a preposterous waste of time."

" Unimpressed
",-0.34,-0.9639,2018-09-14 00:00:00,4,"I didn't like this movie. For starters I didn't like the couple, in particular the guy Paul. I hated that virtually the first half of the movie (until she wanders into the woods) was lovey dovey crap. Every moment virtually was a sugar overdose of touching and kissing. The guy Paul also was very ugly. His face looked like a photo fit you get at the police station. All odd and buck teeth with an obvious wig. Shes just a irritating plain Jane. Then the last half of the movie it become just a bore fest, just horrible and unpleasant. This movie was a bit crap to be honest. Avoid. Watch something better."

It's a psychological thriller that will have you thinking things such as, ""Is schizophrenia involved?"" or ""Does bipolar disorder have something to do with it?""This, to me, is one of those rare thriller low budget movies that can keep you engrossed for its 90 minutes without explosions, buckets of blood or gunfire every five minutes. The acting of the principals is what drives this flick and keeps it floating above water. The beginning of the film might be slow but its development is noteworthy. A solid seven in my book."
" Belly flop
",-0.34,0.9796,2018-08-07 00:00:00,3,"*** SPOILER ALERT ***
I am not sure how anyone could give this movie a rating of 6 or above - most of the reviews rating it as 4 or less are the ones giving honest appraisals here. I agree that the acting is good, but that's like saying someone's a good driver when they are lost and can't remember the destination. And its not very scary at all, though is disgusting in a few places, playing on nightmarish (and perhaps misogynistic) images of female sexuality.
A gripping ending might have salvaged this sorry excuse for a movie, but we don't get that. Sometimes the writer and/or director of a movie think that a vague ending with hints rather than conclusions will reward the viewer by allowing them to do the thinking and go 'a-ha, my keen mind infers that such and such must have happened, and that's clever'. But the ending to this movie is like a cognitive belly flop off the mind's diving board - yes, the baddies could be aliens who have taken over the bodies of the two women, but that takes half a second to guess at and leaves you feeling unsatisfied with such an under-developed and derivative story-line. 
Since there's not enough material here for 90 minutes, it may have worked better as a 30-minute episode in a sci-fi/horror TV series. But as it stands, my advice is: don't bother."

And the movie also had Rose Leslie in it, and that could prove to be a plus.Right, well, I managed to endure 40 minutes of this ordeal of a movie. And nothing of any worth or interest happened in that 40 minutes, so I just gave up on the movie out of sheer and utter boredom.""Honeymoon"" has a very small cast, so they had to perform quite well in order to carry the movie and they did nicely enough.

",0.0,0.9947,2018-04-30 00:00:00,8,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, I wasn't expecting much going in considering the low budget and only 2 focal characters. Especially with the synopsis ""Couple travels to cabin in the woods, then weird stuff starts to happen!"" This same concept has been done a million times, but THIS is one shining example of it done RIGHT.The acting is by far the most impressive aspect, the writers really set it up perfectly for us to get to know the couple and really care about them. It really feels like we are watching a couple that has been together for years. There's nothing worse than poor character development, when the action starts to happen you are not invested and don't care whether the characters live or die. Not here, both of the leads deliver stellar performances. Little clues and hints are sprinkled throughout that leaves you thinking the ending could go in one of countless directions, which is what a great mystery/thriller should do. Nothing is worse than knowing exactly how a movie will end before it even happens, and the writers did a great job at leaving the audience guessing until the very end. I have also noticed a trend with the 1 to 3 star reviews for this movies, almost always they are written with major spelling and/or grammar mistakes. Either they are written by people that are very young, or people that are just not intelligent enough to realize this is supposed to be a mystery/thriller and not a horror. One reviewer was disappointed in the lack of gore, did we watch the same movie? Did they not see the bathroom scene toward the end? Or the bedroom scene at the end? Overall this was a surprisingly well done movie with a perfect cast and team of writers/directors. As long as you go in knowing it is a mystery/thriller and not a horror you will be just fine."

The ending is the best part of the film.The acting is okay. Rose Leslie and Harry Treadaway do a good job but some of the dialogue lines are weak and some scenes just feel scripted.The pacing in the beginning is very slow. The film ends on a high note.

" A Bit of letdown after a great first half
",0.6249,-0.3824,2017-12-05 00:00:00,7,"Honeymoon is a great indie thriller that spends the first segment pulling the viewers into the lives of the 2 main characters and then turns on the nightmare so u get the front row seats to the whole ordeal. It is slow burner which builds up tension very well where as a viewer u are increasingly getting more confused and tensed as time progresses, but that's when it starts to shake in its feet as it fails to deliver on it. The letdown is mainly because how well it actually does the job of grabbing your attention but then fails to end it on that same high note.The Verdict: 6.5/10 It's a good watch because it is a very well executed film based on a very simple script. It has great score that keeps u immersed in the movie, it reeks of high quality indie'ness but in the end is a bit of a letdown because it fails to do much from all the tension it has built and you are left a bit cheated."
" Subtle Terror
",-0.5267,0.8898,2017-11-08 00:00:00,7,"Honeymoon is director Leigh Janiak's feature film debut and you all know how much I love checking out works by female directors, especially when they wind up being as solid as this one is. The film almost exclusively follows Bea (Rose Leslie) and Paul (Harry Treadaway), a newlywed couple who head to Bea's family lakeside cabin in the woods for their honeymoon. They are enjoying their peaceful, serene break from the big city until Bea sleepwalks into the woods one night and comes back mysteriously changed, and not for the better** SPOILERS! **As is common with films like this, it takes a bit to get to the action. In the moment, it felt like a bit much, but as the movie progressed, many of those details came into pretty crucial play — I was really pleased to see just how well-planned that was. I loved how subtle Bea's changes were at first. Paul finding her naked in the woods was jarring, to say the least — and he did a great job at conveying that mix of worry, disbelief, and absolute confusion that one would feel after experiencing such a thing. It's no surprise that he would be on high alert that night and the next day, making sure she truly was alright. But her shifts were initially slight enough that they really could have been from a lack of sleep and, as she says, the stress of the wedding catching up to her. Maybe a bit hard to swallow — forgetting to batter the french toast or to actually brew the coffee — but possible to dismiss as just a one-off odd moment.When they go back out in the rowboat and she spontaneously jumps into the water with her clothes on so perfect. You see this complex expression cross her face — she's trying to be what she's supposed to be, what she's expected to be, and in that moment she knows that she has failed. She knows she has blown her cover, in a subtle way. But she's still hopeful for a moment that it worked.Ultimately, that was an aspect that I enjoyed — she didn't return from the woods having done a complete 180. I don't know if it was meant to be a metaphor for failing relationships/marriage in general, but it's a good one — losing yourself, perhaps to the horror of the person who loves you, despite trying to hold on, trying to shield the other person from your changes, trying to protect them even if it ultimately means killing them — figuratively, I hope — in the process.I also enjoyed the fact that oftentimes in these types of movie scenarios — where one person in a relationships turns out to be not at all what they seem — it's the man who becomes the changed person, who becomes violent or evil. But Janiak flipped that gender stereotype on its head with this one.I think one of the freakiest moments, for me, was when he comes back inside after finding her nightgown in the woods — ripped and inexplicably slimy — and he peeks into the bedroom to see her rehearsing lines in the mirror, practicing how to reject him when he tries to sleep with her. I can just only imagine the feeling of fear he must have had in that moment — fear without knowing fully why, even.The other was when he looks over her shoulder as she's writing in her journal and sees that she's writing down basic facts — ""My name is Bea, my husband is Paul, we live in Brooklyn"", etc. Again, such a rush of terror, both for himself and for her.I thought the inclusion of Will (Ben Huber), Bea's childhood friend, and his wife Annie (Hanna Brown) was a good one, if for no other reason than it ended up adding a sense of strange community to the situation. This wasn't an isolated incident for Bea. Annie was undergoing the same transformation, and Paul finding that out when he went back to the restaurant amped up the urgency to find out what the hell is going on.The final confrontation between Bea and Paul was intense. You can see how much Bea is searching, internally, for the right things to say. She recites her facts word-for-word, exactly as they appear in her journal (chilling). She mentions wanting to protect Paul. He tries their pet name on her — calling her ""Honey Bea"" and waiting for her response — and she replies ""we don't remember"" (ugh). He asks her how he proposed to her and the way she gets it wrong — telling the story as it should have been, not how it happened — was extra creepy, especially considering how proud she seemed to have correctly recited it.We get a touch of body horror here and there with Bea's ""bug bites"" worsening, her alarming bleeding (as Paul tells her he knows she isn't on her period), and eventually her coaxing him to pull a horrifying, serpent-like creature from between her legs as she writhes in pain. The gore was perfectly placed and efficient in its presentation — reminding us of just how much this is a physical transformation as well as a psychological one without being gratuitous.The ending was also pretty fantastic. We aren't 100% clear — or at least I'm not — if Bea's intention really was to hide Paul, that her human and alien instincts were just too merged at that point to realize what she was actually doing by tying him up and sending him over the edge of the boat. But her intentions seemed genuine. And the overlay of her earlier, hopelessly romantic quote to Paul —""Before I was alone and now I'm not"" — was just perfect. Highly recommended!"
" Eerie & Intriguing - Could have been a lot better.
",0.1027,0.4577,2017-10-30 00:00:00,5,"The movie starts out pretty basic. Bride & Groom reminiscing of love & proposal at their wedding.For their honeymoon they go to Beas (Rose Leslie) family cabin by a lake & from the start you get the sense that the place is a little bit off. The beginning of their honeymoon is as you would expect... fun times in the bedroom, bathroom & probably everywhere else they could think of! They run into Baes old childhood friend Will (Ben Huber), who quickly turned them away in anger before realising who they were - then Wills wife, Annie (Hannah Brown) comes out & tells them they should leave, so Will aggressively grabs her to make her stop talking.The next morning, after their odd encounter, strange happenings occur at the house & then Paul (Harry Treadaway) is woken by his alarm to head to fishing, when he drops his bate & realises his alarm went off early he heads back to bed to find Bea is missing - he then sets off to find her.After finding his new wife in the woods, naked at night, they head back to the cabin & then gradually she begins to become distant & strange - not finding things funny, forgetting how to make coffee & french toast, talking to herself in the mirror, rejecting sex etc. Things get more weird from there & in the end... It's not a happy ending..Even when Bea is changing, she still genuinely loves Paul & wants to make him happy but you can see something is pulling her away & her erratic behaviour confuses & worried Paul so much - you really feel for the guy who just wants his Honey Bea back!Rose Leslie & Harry Treadaway, both from the UK are great in this movie & are convincing both with their accents & the love they have for each other as newlyweds.Overall an enjoyable movie that pulls you in, with an eerie setting & no cheap jump scares, making it feel more unsettling! With a slow build up that can get boring at times, could go with a little bit more of the scary stuff to keep you on the edge of your seat. Worth the watch.Slow at times - Average script - Great cast - Intriguing story lineEnd vote for this film is a 5Samm.Wise"
" Honeymooners
",0.0,0.9733,2017-10-27 00:00:00,7,"Agreeing to spend his honeymoon at an isolated cabin in the woods, a newlywed man becomes worried by his wife's increasingly bizarre and unusual behaviour in this intriguing mystery thriller starring Harry Treadaway and Rose Leslie. The film has copped a lot of criticism for its ambiguous ending that leaves several questions unanswered, but this is a metaphorical movie first and foremost with the filmmakers successfully tapping into the anxieties that come with any relationship (how well do you really know the other person?). In fact, the lack of any overt explanation is one of the film's strengths with all thrills and chills coming from the wife's perplexing behaviour as opposed to loud noises, dark shadows or ostentatious special effects. The isolated woodlands setting works in the film's favour too as it challenges our generic expectations; the couple are not vulnerable because they are alone in the woods but rather because they are stuck with each other when they might not know one another as well as they think. Of course, the ending could have been a little clearer here, but with Leslie in particularly good form as the wife whose personality evolves throughout, this is a pretty compelling ride."
" Tragic ending for both the good guy and the good girl
",0.4215,-0.937,2017-10-17 00:00:00,3,"At first I liked the movie. It had lots of suspense, great acting, etc. But the ending was one of the worst endings I have ever seen. To make a long story short, this movie is about a man and a woman who get married and go on a honeymoon. The woman gets abducted by aliens, not without killing her husband first. The woman essentially dies before she adopts the personality of an alien, or something like that. Don't watch it if you like horrible stories and horrible endings."
" Another 'horror' movie that make no sense
",-0.296,-0.9516,2017-10-10 00:00:00,4,"Apparently, some alien beings wanted human women. Why they simply didn't take the women in the first place is beyond me, though that would have made the movie about 5 minutes long (which would have been long enough). Instead, we sit through an entire film that builds quite a bit of suspense, only to lead to a disappointing end that has you questioning why anything in the movie happened the way it did. Man do I hate when that happens.Unfortunately, this isn't one of those movies that's so bad it's entertaining. The acting was decent, and it was pretty suspenseful, but the payoff is a 'what the hell' ending. Wish I had watched something else (though given most horror films aren't very good, I likely would have picked another dog)."

She then has what looks likes a miscarriage ,hubby pulls half a ton of sausage meat out of her lady bits ,and she turns into an advert for skin cream ,there are no spoilers because there's nothing to spoil.i wouldn't recommend you eat your'e dinner while watching it because it's pretty gross ,literally another trash horror trying to shock with extreme scenes of roadkill popping out of body parts.to sum it up it's a pile of trash."
" First, yes, but then, no. Just no
",-0.5789,0.7031,2017-09-20 00:00:00,4,"The problem with this movie is the absence of a real plot. It's like they got the idea of making a mysterious film, but just stopped there. The mystery part isn't actually that bad in itself. I was really focused for the first two thirds, just trying to add the pieces together- you know something weird is happening, and you get all the evidence little by little, and then you start to make assumptions on what is actually happening. I thought that they kept us waiting to finally show us the big reveal that would give it complete sense; but then, no. It's something completely different; it ends with a giant question mark of ""what the hell actually happened?"". Some movies are not meant to make sense, and it's okay, but this one is shaped as a puzzle that can't be assembled. Could have been really good, if someone bothered to actually write a meaningful ending. I'm also giving this bad rating because the two main actors were quite annoying as a couple. They literally act like they just started dating, in the cheesiest way possible, and it's a little over the top. But they're on their honeymoon. Can't possibly recommend it."
" Not often do you find a movie that's a horror with good Sci-fi, Romance, Mystery, Paranoia, Gore, Thrills, etc.
",0.5106,0.9372,2017-08-11 00:00:00,9,"PROS: My favorite, and the best, part about this film was the tension and paranoia throughout. As the movie progressed it felt like the tension rose gradually and the mania did as well. This lead up to a big, horrific, and overwhelming climax with a great resolution. This build up was helped greatly by character development. The actors changed throughout the film making the circumstances more dire and intense. As the characters changed so did the story, making this movie dynamic. I would really give a thumbs up to the actors in HONEYMOON, they felt very genuine. I always appreciate it when actors who are supposed to be dating actually seem realistically in love, it gives the movie an extra umph in the fear factor.CONS: My one con might not be the same for all viewers, but I really felt like I wanted something clearer or more concrete. This is hard because I like the ending and I thought all the hints the script dropped were very helpful, but maybe just one more hint. I don't know if I'm being picky, but that's the only con I could find.www.chorror.com"
" Kept Me Tense
",-0.34,-0.8512,2017-07-28 00:00:00,8,"Honeymoon does a great job of shifting the mood throughout the movie, but there is some awkward direction regarding the lascivious male lead and the indignation of the female lead. Their behavior doesn't feel like it plays into the plot well at times, and it makes you feel like one or the other is just flat out stupid. I felt the ending was a bit anticlimactic, but overall this movie kept me tense and entertained."
" A pretty good but not for everyone movie
",0.4678,0.9756,2017-06-28 00:00:00,7,"This movie is not for everyone. It's got a 73% on rotten tomatoes and a 57% here, and I completely understand why. Some people will love this movie and others will hate it. It's just one of those movies.There's a lot to like about honeymoon. It's very well directed and very well acted, which is extremely important because there's really only two characters. It also maintains a really good level of mystery for almost the entirety of its run time. However, as many reviewers here have pointed out, this movie's slow. And, it's a slow burn. It's a slow moving psychological movie, and some people like that and others don't.I guess the closest thing I can compare it to is The Witch and if you like movies that are slow paced, well acted, psychological, and claustrophobic thrillers like The Witch, then you'll like this. If you don't, then don't watch it. However, there is one glaring flaw that even this movies most die hard of fans must acknowledge. It's ending. This movie is a slow burn, and those movies work a lot better with a satisfying ending. Honeymoons ending really isn't that. It's confusing, and a lot of things in this movie are, but they are in the right way. A slightly confusing ending that doesn't quite clear everything up isn't the right kind of confusing. It's not because, well, it's the ending. If you're confused too bad, and that is this movies big flaw. It doesn't have a good payoff. If it had, I'd have loved it. But it doesn't. And as it stands it's an enjoyable movie if you're into movies like it, but if you're not... It's well made, well acted and well executed, but I just can't guarantee you'll enjoy it."

" A couple in the woods !!!
",0.0,0.9795,2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"'Honeymoon' really reminded me of a few Roman Polanski films like 'Repulsion' and 'Rosemary's Baby'. 'Honeymoon' like most well made and thematically deep psychological horror films,tries to address real- life issues by using generic tropes and distinctive cinematic horror elements. In this case, very believable and tangible marital issues and concerns are addressed by director Leigh Janiak and her co-writer Phil Graziadei.One of the very important reasons why 'Honeymoon' works is because of the way Janiak takes her time to set up and convey the sweet and tender love between Bea and Paul. She uses a beautiful opening credits sequence of Bea and Paul giving talking head style interviews for their wedding video interspersed with shots of the road during their drive to the honeymoon spot symbolising the journey they have made together in life. There is an extended unbroken long take inside the cottage where Bea introduces the different rooms to Paul and it's a beautiful and sweet sequence again underlying the sweet nature of their relationship. It's only because we believe the love between them, that we feel uneasy when things start falling apart. There is a connection between 'Honeymoon' and Polanski's 'Repulsion' in the way that both Bea and Paul start becoming more and more paranoid upon realising that they might not be completely ready for every concern and expectation that comes along with marital life which is similar to Carole's paranoia in 'Repulsion' which was borne out of her inability to cope with adulthood, sexuality and the male gaze because she was still a young child at heart and the mental disintegration takes place in somewhat of a similar fashion in both these films. The paranoia forces both Bea and Paul to change and neither of them like the changed new individuals that the other becomes on this post-marriage honeymoon trip. But 'Honeymoon' also shares a connection with Andrzej Żuławski's 'Possession' in the way it externalises marital problems in very visceral and visually disturbing ways.We have two Brits - a Scottish woman(Rose Leslie) and an Englishman(Harry Treadaway) pretending to be an American couple, but they are really good and made me believe their marriage, their love, their mutual concerns and their subsequent paranoia.Leigh Janiak gets good performances out of her actors and also elevates the film with her intricate visual storytelling choices. The hand held camera helps to add to the intimacy of the relationship between Bea and Paul. This is a solid piece of work where the director makes the most out of limited resources available to her due to the low budget."
" Honey Full Moon..
",0.0,0.9022,2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Honeymoon is a well made and well acted indie psychological horror flick. It's dark & full of tension and is shot with a subtle gritty warm filter which adds a beautiful yet gloomy overtone to the film. If jump scares are your thing then you won't find too much of that here. Although there are some scenes that will without a doubt give you the chills. This is a very dark and creepy movie and should make you feel a little uneasy at times.Rose Leslie is a very solid actor from what I've seen of her so far and hope to see her in bigger roles. Love her in Game of Thrones and loved her in this. She comes off very natural to me in her roles.Overall a very creepy horror flick and I don't quite understand the low rating what-so-ever. This is why I always read the IMDb boards and individual reviews prior to watching a movie as the rating system is without a doubt flawed at times. If you are a horror movie buff like me and need another one to add to your list, Honeymoon should fit right in..."
