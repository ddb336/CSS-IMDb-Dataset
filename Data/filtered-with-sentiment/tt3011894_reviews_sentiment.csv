",0.0,0.9607,2021-03-13 00:00:00,8,"What a film, one of the best argentinian films ever.
This is the best dark comedy that I have seen, without a doubt. The best part was, obviusly, the wedding, but I want you to put attention at Darin. The best argentinian actor EVER. He could work in Hollywood but he didn't want to. Why? Because in Hollywood they think that if you are latin then you are a drug diller or something like that. Is time to change it, Darin is just one of a millon actors that you lose because you think that in latin america we don't have talent. Watch this film and say that. We are more talented than you think."

" A dish best served cold.
",0.6369,0.8472,2021-01-13 00:00:00,7,"'Wild Tales (2014)' is an anthology of six entirely separate short stories, which are only connected by their loose themes of revenge. Each film is longer than the last and, generally speaking, more chaotic, too. They're separated from their peers only by a few frames of darkness, leading to surprisingly cohesive overall affair. Of course, the movie as a whole doesn't really have an arc to it and, as such, it isn't a hugely affecting experience in retrospect. However, it's incredibly engaging in the moment. It's an enjoyable time throughout, with each of its stories being of a similar quality. They're an odd mixture of societal unrest, melodramatic drama and unflinching violence, usually escalating to unpredictable extremes with blackly comic undertones. Their cinematography is fantastic, too. It's hard to separate them, in a way, but they're also decidedly distinct from one another. The overall film truly is just a compilation of them. That, obviously, isn't a bad thing. Though it doesn't really have a lasting impact, the movie is a unique, well-made and entertaining affair right from its opening moments. 7/10"
" Duck Tales for the mature audience
",0.4215,0.7062,2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Wild Tales was released one year before the horrific Germanwings suicide crash, and one can't but help think whether the opening story inspired the German pilot to do the unthinkable. Anyway, the opening story was gripping with taut screenwriting. The second story (the poisoning) had a chilling premise, but the ending lacked any real twist. A rather procedural ending.The third story (with beautiful scenery of the Argentinian countryside) had a twist in the tale with its prescient reference to LGBTI rights in an unexpected and twisted way that would make Tales of the Unexpected proud for sure. The fourth story was kind of redemptive. The fifth story was tense and exposed the underbelly of state sponsored judicial corruption.The sixth story, set at a wedding, started off with a bang. However it was 15 minutes too long.Perhaps Wild Tales can be rebooted as a TV series."

" The violent instinct
",-0.5994,-0.9832,2020-12-20 00:00:00,8,"""Relatos Selvagens"" manages to transmit through short films the most diverse shades of violence existing, the violence contained over the years, the violence of revenge, the violence of occasion, the violence of omission, the violence provided by the system and the extrapolated violence.The film can be visceral because it can easily put the viewer into the work and exposes how we will deal with the situation if we use violence, as when we discover a betrayal, or when we respond to a discussion in traffic or even when we are victims of state bureaucracy, everyone they have been through similar situations, and violence, one of the oldest and most permanent human instincts.The direction of the shorts is good, each one with its particularities, some of them have a hot photo and a track in the best ""Gaspar Noe"" style, in others we have the construction going to the absurd in the most Lars Von Trier way, we feel the most diverse references in each historia, which complements a functional and very interesting film, is a collection without fear of exposing the absurd and how Machiavelli can be human nature."
" Not a comedy
",-0.2755,-0.9753,2020-12-04 00:00:00,4,"The car scene in Pulp Fiction could be described as black comedy, but this movie is just dark aggression, violence and not much else. At least in the first three scenes I saw before I stopped watching. I do not understand why this has the tag 'comedy' as there is nothing funny at all about the dark violence in this film. Only a sick mind could describe it as funny. That aside, the film is well made, everything is very realistic. But it's absolutely not a comedy, hence my low rating."
" Elegantly Irreverent Celebration of Revenge
",-0.128,0.9472,2020-11-13 00:00:00,9,"The horrendousness of the acts of these people -when they finally go off the deep end- will first make you gasp in disbelief and then laugh like a child discovering humor for the first time. Just, this time, it would be an adult enjoying something that is throughly WRONG. Which I always get my rocks off on so, there you go.I find user reviews to be the most helpful, on IMDb, when I'm trying to decide whether to watch a film or not. You can easily read into what kind of a person wrote the review; so even a 1/10 bashing can serve as a recommendation and high praise indeed, for me. Or, I see 6/10 rated film with somebody noting the same kind of things in a film as I do, and giving it a 9/10 - so I go for it. So, now you know me: my humomr is twisted and dark, and this horrendous yet elegantly irreverent celebration of revenge -the things we'd wanna do... on occasion but don't- left me giggling like a 12-year old school girl. Which I'm not, by the way.Cinematically speaking, Wild Tales / Relatos Salvajes is beautifully shot. I'm no pro, so... just talking about the colors and shades and contrast and such I'd say, Tarantino? Perhaps in Reservoir Dogs, that's the kind of contrast you get. The brightness when out in the open and the darkness bringing in the intimacy to the dialogue when indoors. I guess. I saw the film about a year ago. I'll just have to watch it again and come back and revise if memory serves me ill.So, if you're One of Us Who Likes It Dark and Well Just Wrong, go ahead and enjoy!"

" Human Anthology composed by Six Wild stories of Vengeance and Violence.
",-0.6249,0.8196,2020-07-11 00:00:00,7,"Wild Tales (2014) :Human Anthology composed by Six Wild stories of Vengeance and Violence. This idea has hit me hard, truly. Six different stories about vengeance and all of them being highly violent and brutal makes one solid compilation but all Six doesn't work. How about reviewing each story individually? I would rate them separately and then calculate average from combined total.The first one is ""Pasternak"", it's Fantastic. I loved this Group Revenge. Rating- 8/10.No. 2 is ""Las Ratas"", it's Decent. Very short and simple revenge. Rating- 6/10.Third is ""El más fuerte"". Another Good Story of Violence and quick Revenge with twisty ending. Rating- 7/10.No. 4 is Bombita, The Best among all six. Revolutionary. A common man's outrage against system. 9/10""La propuesta"" is the fifth and the one with the least brutality. It depicts greed of being Rich while a Poor man lost his close one. Rating- 8/10.The last one and undoubtedly the Weakest one. ""Hasta que la muerte nos separe"" is about 'just married couple'. In the celebration party the wife discovers about husband's sexual affair with one of guest and she avenges by having sex with a Hotel worker on the terrace. It follows emotional conflicts but still fails to make sense. Rating- 4/10.
So, the total score is 42 out of 60 that makes Average Rating 7/10.Damián Szifron's direction is splendid and as writer he's good overall but i he should have tried to find out the comparative effect before finalising all 6 stories. If one works and other one doesn't then naturally it harms the objective score in final session. All 6 should have worked on saem level and then only it would have been a Classic attempt. Nevertheless, 3 stories are fantastic and highly recommended, 1 is very good, 1 one is good and 1 is Below average so if you can spare that last one then everything else is good to Brilliant.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"

Your perfect plan can turn to anywhere, you don't have idea where.6) The first night of the couple: A cheerful wedding, full of posh and high society guests, the couple, a secret, a not secret then public.

" The fine blend of social Darwinism with edge of humanity
",0.2023,-0.1857,2020-02-14 00:00:00,9,"Borrowing from what Charles Darwin said, a concept called Social Darwinism evolved in the 1870s. The social Darwinists' argument is simple - in what can be considered as a de-facto era of capitalism, the strong should always seek to add to their power and exploit the weak.The most impressive thing about the weak is perhaps their elasticity. They don't break easily; they allow exploitation as long as they can. In other words, they remain 'civilized'. But when they chose 'act' over 'adapt', control holds no meaning.Damian Szifron said that the vertigo of losing temper is what separates civilization from barbarism. The border is a hazy one and his film, Retalos Salvajes, is about its blending. The film is an anthology, containing six stories that are united by a single theme - violence.The protagonists of the stories are what the social Darwinists would describe as the 'weaker' section. Clearly, they have been oppressed in some form of the other, but haven't reiterated, which keeps them humane. Szifron says human beings turn into animals when they explode, and the film is a depiction of the transition.The film's stories focuses on an urge which often acts as the hazy border between humans and animals - Revenge. Whether it is Gabriel Pasternak of the first story or Simon Fischer of the fourth, every protagonist is seeking revenge. Szifron has written the screenplay in a way which keeps the audience hooked to their screens. What's more impressive is, Szifron subtly highlights how each and every so-called 'animal' is perfectly human in their own rights.The film is produced by the famous Almodovar brothers. Javier Julia's cinematography is as immaculate as it could have been. Perhaps the greatest regret an audience will have after watching this film is that Szifron hasn't made another film after this."

You could be watching a superhero movie, and you may be enjoying it as it separates you from real world a bit, nothing is shameful in that. This movie is the opposite, it puts you in reality and its harshness ( in a fast, intense, and entertaining way ), it makes you think, imagine yourself in such a very possible ordeal, and hence it's a masterpiece.

However, Wild Tales, is a rare exception to the aforesaid pitfall as Damián Szifron, who has written and directed each of the six shorts, strikes a fine balance among them and has pruned off almost all flab from the proceedings which engross the viewer in their taut storylines.
The movie begins with Pasternak, where a model boards an air plane and finds, through a casual conversation with another passenger, that she shares a connection with all her co-passengers in the form of her ex-boyfriend, Gabriel Pasternak. This is the shortest piece among the ensemble and precedes the title credits and packs a wicked punch in its tail that would leave a lasting impact.
The Rats (Spanish - Las Ratas) is set in a rainy night on deserted diner, wherein the waitress finds that the lone grumpy customer stepping in is, in fact, the loan shark who had driven her father to suicide and ruined her family. While she is inclined to insult him verbally, she finds herself caught in a bind of a fledgling moral compass, when the cook - an ex-jailbird herself - suggests mixing rat poison in his food.
In The Strongest (Spanish - El más fuerte), a suave corporate honcho is driving in his swanky premium car through a remote highway when he encounters a driver in a shabby truck who frustrates him by blocking the path with his crawling pace. He verbally abuses the truck driver and shows him the finger when he ultimately manages to overtake the truck. However, things escalate into a catastrophic case of road rage - a la Spielberg's ""Duel"", albeit in an ultra-violent version - when the honcho's swanky car has a flat tire and finds that the truck driver is the first to arrive on the scene .
In ""Little Bomb"" (Spanish - Bombita), a demolitions expert (Ricardo Darin - ""The Secret in their Eyes""), trying to reach home to be in time for his daughter's birthday party, stops to buy her a cake and finds that his car was towed away despite the absence of any markings on the parking space as tow-away zone. He is driven into a righteous rage and his quest to seek justice from the corrupt system pushes him into a downward spiral resulting in him losing his money, his job and even his fragile family. His response to this unfolding turmoil transforms him into an unlikely popular hero.
The Deal (Spanish - ""La Propuesta"") finds a rich manipulative businessman trying to salvage a situation when he finds that his son is involved in a hit and run accident which has resulted in the death of a pregnant woman. He contacts his lawyer, a long time associate and together they cook up a plan to convince the poor gardener to become the fall guy in lieu of a suitable compensation to his family. But, when the lawyer and the investigating cop start demanding their own pound of flesh for the cover-up, the rich man finds himself in familiar territory of being a hard nosed negotiator in a high stakes game.
The final piece, Until death do us part (Spanish - ""Hasta que la muerte nos separe"") takes place in a boisterous wedding reception which descends into an unbridled chaotic see-saw finale when the bride, Romina (an electric Erica Rivas) discovers that the groom was sleeping with one of the guests.Seen as a whole, while Bombita and La Propuesta might seem a few shades darker in comparison to the other four stories, they stand out for their gravitas and social commentary.While at the apparent level there is no connection between the six stories, Szifron weaves them in the same thematic thread where he pushes his leads to their breaking point in a narrative that sparkles with fluency and visual flair. He also manages to transcend the vicious violence in these stories to present his views on the social decay that festers in the form of corruption, inequality and injustice that permeate Argentina at every level. Each of his stories is a resplendent exposition of Szifron's consummate skills as a writer-director, where his stories immerse the viewers in an intense roulette of role reversals, set to a lively pace, packed with oodles of wicked dark humour and horror in equal measures right till their twisted denouement.Wild Tales was a final nominee for the award for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards where it lost to the Polish movie, Ida. It has also received wide critical as well as popular acclaim across several international film festivals where it was screened."

When you have six unrelated stories without any plot or character continuity. I asked myself, would I watch this if it were a television series if it maintained this level of quality and the answer is assuredly yes, but it's highly unlikely that it could maintain it, as much as I'm surprised I liked each segment here.

This was perfectly plasmed on screen by Szifron.I didn't enjoy the very violent scenes, but understand that they had to be done this way.On the other hand, I loved the bombita story, not only because of the great acting by Darin, but also for representing the absurdness of argentine's burocracy that would get you mad.

" ""Wild"" indeed. And very enjoyable.
",0.4927,-0.712,2018-12-19 00:00:00,8,"In various parts of Argentina, six short films all have a theme of revenge. In all cases, ""wild"" is definitely the operative word of the title.In the first segment, a massive revenge is played out - one which might appeal to many of us at least in fantasy. Its conclusion is frighteningly prophetic considering a similar event that occurred after the film was made.In the second segment, a young waitress recognizes a rude customer who badly mistreated her family many years ago. She has a striking conversation with the cook who seems to have no issue about serving 'just desserts'. This conversation (which includes the speculation that prison life would be better than living a life of underpaid work) is sinister in an oddly appealing way. We might not agree with the cook at first but she sounds strangely convincing.The third sequence is the ultimate road-rage show as it pits a city boy against a country boy. This is one that goes over-the-top at times including a scene that is truly gross (don't eat while watching it). Despite the high antics, the solid directing by Damian Szifron still keeps us on edge eager to know what could possibly happen next.In segment # 4, an engineer with a willful personality is at odds with his city's procedures on towing vehicles. He is so stubborn at times, that it is challenging whether or not to side with him even if most viewers would share his anger at government bureaucracy and civil servants who are snotty. The conclusion is rather shocking in a way that leaves one smiling.The fifth segment is the only serious one of the lot. A rich family and its lawyer work to buy justice to avoid having one of its members persecuted in a crime. It's very spine-tingling with lapses of morality being the main source of the tension. The shocking conclusion leaves one wishing that this story had been extended to a full feature-length film.The sixth and final segment follows a wedding party that goes to hell in a hand-basket. While all performers in all segments are great, it is fair to say that Erica Rivas, as the unhinged bride, gives the movie's standout performance. Like the third segment, the revenge/punishment seems to exceed the original harmful deed. The conclusion might seem unbelievable but the path of reaching it is so wonderfully chaotic, it seems to have credibility after all.Szifron directed all segments with great skill. He potentially leaves viewers enjoying the revenge vicariously while maybe getting in touch with some of our own worst human instincts."
" An absurdly crazy film
",-0.34,0.2651,2018-12-16 00:00:00,10,"How should I begin to talk about this delicious Argentinian film without spoiling all it has promised? Wild Tales is a black-comedy anthology film consisting of six distinctive stories directed by Damian Szifron with one consistent theme: revenge. In the 21st Century, most people live begrudgingly having to repress themselves, but some do explode. And this is the film about those that explode.
The film begins with ""Pasternak"", a shocking start to a two-hour roller coaster ride. The beautiful runway model, briskly boards a plane with the ticket fully paid by her company. She walked right into a surprising reunion. It seems that everyone on the plane knows her ex-boyfriend, Pasternak. More than 30 000 in the air, what could they do?
The next tale takes us deeper into the joy of vengeance. ""The Rats"" sets in a small diner on a rainy night. The waitress recognized the new customer to be the loan shark that destroyed her family. And he is now running for mayor! Back at the kitchen, she is content to just repress her anger, however, the old cook has other ideas. Why should ""bastards run the world?""
The ""Road to Hell"" pushes the film to a climax. A case of road rage between the rich Audi driver and a redneck driver of a slow-moving truck. This part contains absurd violence.
""Bombita"" tells the demolition engineer's misfortunes that has started when his car keeps getting towed from the streets where there isn't a yellow line. His struggle to fight the corrupt towing company was fruitless. He'll have to use his own knowledge as a tool of redemption.
However funny the previous tales were, no one would be laughing in the ""The Deal."" A rich couple woke up to find their pampered son shaking from the hit-and-run in which he was the driver. They try to get the gardener to take the fall for a hefty sum. The justice isn't served in this ugly tale.
The last tale, ""Till Death Do Us Apart"", is absolutely brilliant finish to the film. It is startling, but also the most glorious of all. Set at a lavish wedding, the deliriously happy bride Romina, with her husband Ariel, celebrates with a hall full of family and friends. Until Romina discovered that Ariel has cheated on her - then all hell broke down.
Any of these short tales could have been shot separately and would each be brilliant short movies. But together, a brilliant movie was created. I do urge you to watch this absurdly crazy film."

Fun and interesting but not even close to be an 8+Movies like The original Predator, Avatar, Arrival, many other very good dramas are not in the 250. Like if you compare these shorts to those movies. You can't say these are better :D I mean for real.Movies that were a milestones in the filmmaking are in the 250. For just a shot, lighting, framing, being the first blockbuster, etc. Those are all top100 movies.A movie like the Avatar with the highest gross and incredible visuals, 10 years later noone made a movie that was even close to that in visuals is not a even in the 250.

How the character tackles their situation is completely unique and the writing manages to form unique characters for the story so that it feels as fleshed out as a regular movie.
It's inventive, fresh and would be a shame to miss out on."
" When people reach their breaking point
",0.0258,0.9711,2018-07-13 00:00:00,7,"Wild Tales is a collage of six short films, all different in circumstance and characters. Yet they all deal with the same thing. What would it look like if someone reached their utter breaking point, was taken over the line of what is bearable, and just... snapped.It can sound a bit over the top, and the film is labeled comedy for a reason, but at the same time director Damián Szifron gives it a dark undertone. Many of the stories are more than critical towards Argentinian government and public offices, and lets face it, people rarely snap in a graceful manner. Still the balance is always there. It is ugly, jarring and sometimes even a bit unpleasant, but you can always find the humour in the situation.I'd even argue that it isn't played enough for laughs. The first story, taking place on an airplane, is easily the most outlandish of the six. A truly bizarre scene that ends just about perfectly. It raises the bar quite high and none of the stories that follow can match it. To be fair, they're not even trying to, being more realistic in scope and circumstance, but it's still somewhat a shame.My second favourite is actually the second most outlandish one. A man has his car towed on the day of his daughter's birthday, and being a demolition engineer, he figures it's a high time to do something about this veritable highway robbery that masquerades as a towing office.My least favourite would probably be the last one, taking place at a wedding. It's a bit on the long side and the humour just isn't there. It has some good moments in it, but overall it left me feeling quite ambivalent.Still, none of the stories were bad by any means. Definitely worth a watch for all fans of dark humour and for those wanting to check out what South American film industry looks like."

While there is something that tries to pass as dark/black humour in there at all the usual cues, it just wasn't funny. Personally, I found it all quite predictable, boring and a little sad.

It was as the third story started that I realized I had seen this before, a couple of years ago.

The writing in these stories reminds me of the slightly twisted black comedy mystery stories told on the old ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" a few decades ago.

This segment is so perfect that no continuation is really necessary, and the film should have ended with the last scene of Pasternak. Regrettably, it does not, and the remaining five shorts are no match to Pasternak, the last two parts being excessively long and merely intended to help the director to come up with a full-length feature. Nonetheless, the beauty of Pasternak justifies a solid 7."

",0.6369,-0.7204,2018-01-26 00:00:00,9,"The entire film is in Spanish, but don't let that get in the way of see it. This is not just a good foreign film, but a really good film in general. 
Lately I've been wanting to seek out good foreign films to watch and see what other countries are doing since many of them are still struggling to develop their film industries and compete with Hollywood. Argentina, like South Korea, is apparently starting to become a power house in that regard. 
Now, about this film. It's different from what you normally see, because this isn't the typical narrative/3 ACT structured movie we all usually see. It's comprised of 6 short films all with the same themes of vengeance and violence. Very dark humor, for the most part, other than mainly one story that was pretty serious throughout. For many of these characters you do get somewhat attached to them, at least to the point where you're interested to see how things turn out for them, even though you'll only see them for 15-20 minutes - so good storytelling.TL;DR - Really good/different movie, strongly recommendFavorite segment...

" Worst Case Scenarios; Uff-dah

This film is a series of unrelated vignettes related only in tone and atmosphere. The tone can easily be described as dark as in each vignette the characters make the worst possible decisions. For example, getting your car towed followed by making idiotic choices can eventually derail your life. What other life scenarios will play out? Will you be able to imagine how far things will go? Often hard to watch at times from a cringe factor perspective, it will no doubt evoke the viewer's emotion. This had high production quality and good acting. Will you be able to hang in there?"

" ""Can't you see that I love you?""
",0.6369,0.9486,2017-11-18 00:00:00,10,"If you consider the word 'salvajes' in the Spanish language version of this title, ""Relatos Salvajes"", it closely resembles the word 'savage' in English, doesn't it? That's what came to my mind, as the six unconnected stories in this movie could just as well have been titled ""Savage Tales"". They are all positioned at some level for a savage outcome, and some of them are ironically hilarious in the execution, especially the wedding story between Romina and Ariel that closes things out.Another common element to be found in the offing is that familiar bugaboo about unintended consequences. The two tales of catastrophic road rage bear that theme out in cataclysmic fashion. The third story about the two drivers escalating into a violent confrontation ending in a fiery finale is so over the top that you wouldn't even consider the investigating sheriff's comment about a crime of passion. But it's there and lends a twisted component to the gruesome tale, one that will double you over with it's demented logic.The hit and run segment was another one of those unintended consequence stories that was visited in the end upon the hapless gardener who thought he was going to come out of it set for life. It's interesting to consider what might have happened to all the other parties involved after this story went black. All those scheming money grubbers were going to wind up with nothing in my interpretation, with their golden goose cooked. But I'm sure they would still try to squeeze Mauricio with his fat bank account. The unbridled greed in the story is enough to make you wince.And what can you say about the wedding story? The way it played out and the way it ended were so diametrically opposed to each other that you can only wind up shaking your head. But I guess that's what made it so viscerally entertaining. My summary quote is a line from the song that played out over the closing of that story, another fitting but ironic tribute to a masterful tale of love gone wrong and traveling full circle.This is the only film I've ever seen from the young Argentinian director Damian Szifron, but if his other output is even half as creative, he's got a huge future ahead. His credits page on IMDb points to primarily TV work, but if ""Wild Tales"" is any indication, we'll be seeing and hearing a lot more about him in the years to come."
" Revenge and comedy rule this movie.
",-0.2263,-0.9725,2017-11-06 00:00:00,9,"""Wild Tales"" (Relatos Salvajes in the original) is by far, one of my favorite movies. The six combined stories that compose this amazing cinematic experience - ""Pasternak"" (Pasternak), ""The Rats"" (Las Ratas), ""The Strongest"" (El más Fuerte), ""Little Bomb"" (Bombita), ""The Proposal"" (La Propuesta) and ""Till Death Do Us Apart"" (Hasta que la Muerte nos separe) - , bring to life our deepest desires and craziest reactions when faced with typical everyday life situations. It also makes us wonder how the little acts and decisions can easily make things fall apart in a matter of seconds. Although all the short stories were written by the same person (Damián Szifron), they were directed and produced by different people, which gives this movie a particularity not commonly found in the movie industry. In my opinion, the greatest thing about this movie is that is a roller coaster of emotions. We are invited to immerse the stories and to live together with the characters what they are experiencing. And although, the stories have different themes - drama, comedy, etc. - the one thing that connect all of them, without exception, is the vendetta. The next parts may contain spoilers, so read it with care. The revenge is shown to us in many different ways. We see it as in an old and maturated remorse and hate towards others (as it is displayed in the Pasternak's story) and we can also find some of it in The Rats, but the feeling of punishing the man that was responsible for the protagonist death didn't come from the girl, but for her coworker in the restaurant.On the other stories (The Strongest, Little Bomb and Till Death Do Us Apart), we see it as a mad driven feeling, but the difference is that something happened at that moment. Is a fresh action that triggered that feeling. Actually, even in the 5th story, The Proposal we can see it in the last, very last scene. The soundtrack is also incredible and it is in the hands of Gustavo Santaolalla, an Argentinian producer, and songwriter. His work can also be seen in other pre-staged movies (""Babel"", ""Into The Wild"", ""The Brokeback Mountain"", ""The Motorcycle Diaries"") and also in the worldwide famous video game, ""The Last of Us"". To wrap it up, it's a full movie: you will cry from laughing, you will cry from sadness, you will feel shocked and also a little embarrassed. It's a movie that you can see with a relative, friends, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. I just don't think it is well suited for children (since it can be a little violent and also have some sexual scenes)."
" Darkest comedy ever
",-0.1779,0.9607,2017-10-27 00:00:00,10,"I found this movie coincidentally. 6 stories, one by one, I see humour that doesn't make me laugh, but merely put me in situation of how the jokes are happening for real. Jokes which slapping my face more than entertaining. But it has power of making me curious like hell to next story, keep going and going. Thank God, it is only 6 stories for the director to nail it, to play with me psychologically. Thumbs up as I recommend it to every one."
" Evolution of humanity
",0.0,-0.93,2017-09-09 00:00:00,8,"6 stories, 6 lifes, all connected by two things: society and rage.Marvelous stories represent clear evolution of society and we came to this point. Point that film shows.((Thousands of years ago we discovered fire, admired to the planet, helped each other.) Now, we care about us, our problems, our lifes and nothing else.)Scrict norms cause problems and conflicts which product is rage. And rage of one member of society, transmits to other member, though cohesion, causing deep social problems and awakes different deviations in behavior. Keeping this tempo of life (including governing), without looking aside will cause anarchy, and rule of rage, instead of law. The world as it is now, lifes of people, will more and more turn in these stories, if we don't change something in our perception of others and world."
" Perfect human being movie.
",0.5719,0.9273,2017-07-21 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this film because the plot is based on the Argentinian routine. With a dark humor and sarcasm, typically Argentinian. The theme revenge is the main subject, that makes the movie interesting of course without the Hollywood imaginary fantasy. Outside the American circuit, Argentinian movies are a good option for no boring movies and they have excellent actors.I am a big fan of Ricardo Darín, and Argentinian movies and certainly, this movie was one of the best I saw, from Argentina."
" Waauw.
",0.0,0.4497,2017-06-22 00:00:00,10,"This is one hell of a ride. There are 6 completely different story's that are completely separate but still feel like one movie.It's basically all about things in live that can make a person angry, things we can all relate to. Like road rage, being under-appreciated, being cheated etc.It always starts with something like that, but the reactions of the people in these stories always take it on a path that gets you thinking: How is this going to end? The situations get so out of control that you think if they would just calm down and think about it, it wouldn't get out of control so much. But on the other hand you perfectly understand why they do what they do.And you just know you have made similar mistakes in the past, how unreasonable they may seem from a distance.I call this a master piece."
" Excellent Movie Making
",0.5719,0.975,2017-06-03 00:00:00,10,"This is an excellent piece that will entertain you from the very first second to the last. I am looking forward to seeing this movie again with someone that would appreciate it. While it is completely in Argentine Spanish (which is great for me as I am a fluent Spanish-speaker) it has subtitles which are excellent. The combination of acting and story are truly magnificent. Comparing this movie to a Tarantino film is inaccurate, however, this is better than Tarantino. Tarantino's films are mostly satirical. There is no satire in this movie."
" Wildly crazy, witty, entertaining...
",-0.34,0.9706,2017-05-04 00:00:00,9,"I was recommended to watch Relatos salvajes some time ago, but was busy with some series and postponed it, plus I had no clear idea what it was about and how was it structured. But when the 1st tale was approaching its climax, it became evident that many catchy moments would be waiting me... Some parts are less realistic than others, but definitely not airy-fairy, and smart dialogues with distinct performances paved the way for lots of giggling, moments with black humour, and some grisly recognition how easily a rampage can occur... ""El más fuerte"" and ""Bombita"" are the tales I enjoyed most, they seem most sustained and elaborate, the final one - ""Hasta que la muerte nos separe"" - gave me mixed feelings and I found that its pace was somewhat uneven, rounding up the all bunch in less interesting manner, but still, after some delay time and considering the film comes from Argentina, I have decided to give 9 points - the film in question is highly recommended to all fond of dissimilar productions and approaches."
" Wildly Entertaining Tales
",0.4404,0.9576,2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"This film is, in fact, six short films sharing a central theme of revenge. They all involve people in extreme circumstances that lead to a highly entertaining series of events. If I had to pick, I would probably say that the final segment, ""Hasta que la muerte nos separe"", was my favourite. That would be followed by ""Bombita"" & ""El más fuerte"". Though the film is six unique stories, I felt they flowed well together. The film does a great job of mixing humour into these otherwise serious situations. Overall, I very much enjoyed this movie.8/10************SPOILER************Recommended to those that enjoy plane crashes, poisoning, road rage, sticking it to the man, rich privilege, rooftop revenge f**king, happy endings...?...but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Once"
" Black comedy that translates well.
",0.5574,0.9642,2017-03-21 00:00:00,8,"Short story collections rarely work as feature length films, usually because one strand is stronger than others or the overall message is weak or tenuous. Here the links between each tale are subtle genius and as a whole it plays beautifully. Also rare is how well the dark comedy translates from a non English language culture, so universal are the human emotions on display. A perfect blend of drama and pathos across the board. I'll definitely be watching this again and recommending it to people for many years. Well directed, written and acted. Each scenario far fetched yet thoroughly believable. A strong 8/10."
" Savages
",-0.5267,0.9845,2017-02-21 00:00:00,7,"'Relatos Salvajes' - or 'Wild Tales' as it is better known - this Argentinean film spins six stories showcasing how wild human beings can become when stressed and vengeful. Best described as a dark comedy, the events at hand often seem outrageous until one realises just how tense the characters are, and all the tales other than the fifth one deliver laughs in the face of tragedy and misfortune. The initial sequence with a 'Twilight Zone' air is by far the best chapter and yet it is sadly over before the end credits roll. The last two stories also run too long, exhausting their premises quickly. The scattered memorable bits and pieces of 'Wild Tales' are, however, endlessly powerful. As mentioned, the first tale is the best with a mysterious plane flight. A follow-up tale in which a waitress cannot decide whether to poison a gangster's food is equally intense and a third sequence with two deserted highway drivers has the biggest laughs. The fourth tale involves bureaucracy gone mad and features the most relatable protagonist. The fifth sequence involving a covered-up hit-and-run is the weakest, lacking the comedic air of the earlier segments, and while comedy comes back in full force for the sixth tale of a wedding gone awry, the chapter is a little on the long side. If hardly perfect, 'Wild Tales' is well worth watching. The quality of the tales vary, but they overlap magnificently well thematically, and per as the opening credits over wild animals, the film intelligently explores how we all have the capacity to release our inner animal instincts in the perfect storm of circumstances."
" Wow, Anger is really a powerful emotion!
",0.54,0.6794,2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Great movie telling stories I would label centering around anger. I realized how powerful anger emotion is and how quickly it can ruin your life for good.1) Airplane: It was developed beautifully and gratz to the pilot for determination.2) Restaurant: The douche bag of a guy basically kills the girls father, girl thinks about confronting him and the chef lady thinks confronting him is not enough at all. 3) Car: Need to be careful about road rage, you don't know who is the guy in the other car. I think this goes for any rage. I think I can conclude that we shouldn't rage.4) Tow away: Really good criticism of government and it's fines. There should be a better method to determine which fine is just. Also I agree that most government workers are really annoying, they don't enjoy their job at all and the mind set ""I am just trying to do my job"" is absolutely true.5) Hit and run: Really good visualization of what money can make people do. Basically if you have enough money, you carry a get out jail card with you. The twist in the end was really awesome, poor gardener.6) Wedding: This was my favorite story by far. It shows that how things can escalate quickly out of hand. Also it is easy to make bad decisions while under so much pressure like a wedding ceremony. I must say bride was really good and very nice acting. But I doubt that make up sex will solve their problem...Awesome movie, really effected me while being entertaining."
