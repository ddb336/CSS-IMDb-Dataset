" Heaven is Quite Unproven to be Real by this Movie
",0.5106,-0.9679,2021-04-04 00:00:00,1,"Don't see this for the sake of your intelligence and everlasting soul.This was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I found this to be so bad that it is my first movie review I've ever made, because it was so bad it compelled me to make sure I helped to lower it's mean rating. It is SOOOO boring, and I was told to see this by a believer who compelled me to see it because it would prove heaven is real.I think I conveyed my disappointment in the movie when the end came, I said to her, ""What?! That's it?! THAT was supposed to prove to me heaven and Jesus is real?! Some oxygen deprived child who of course was seeing hallucinations because his brain was literally farting into disfunctionality through death, claims he saw heaven and god, and that's supposed to convince me?!?! It's more likely he was having a near-death naturally induced DMT trip greatly influenced by his delusion in christianity."" And I laughed my way out of the room.This movie really portrays christians (and the dippoop father) to be totally batpoop crazy, ignorant, blind fools. I can't believe people actually believe in this stuff so much that they would make one of the (unhyperbolized) most boring movies of all time."
" Lying for Jesus
",-0.5267,0.8934,2021-02-17 00:00:00,1,Want to easily get a lot of money? Write a book and make a movie about you going to Heaven and meeting God. Millions of Christians will believe you and happily give you money. And you will even become famous.
" Not sure what to think
",-0.2411,0.8098,2020-11-03 00:00:00,7,"First of all, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I am partial to children though. Whether or not I believe that Colton really went to heaven is the issue I address. One thing that impresses me is that Colten really had no reason to say the things he did, so it does cause me to believe there is a reason for this to be substantial. However, I have some difficulty believing his account, based on the information he described. First of all, the only people that received known information about the events Colten described is his parents, so we all know that we want to believe that our children are correct (at least those of us that maintain sanity). Also, looking at the goofs I saw that it was already noted that Jesus must have been of a darker skin color. The image of Jesus being white is the general depiction we are all used to, and don't want to change. My conclusion is that the story may or may not be true, however the movie is worth watching!"
" It was pretty boring
",0.2263,0.8145,2020-10-08 00:00:00,3,"I gave this movie a chance but I just couldn't sit through it that long. The characters aren't bad but they're pretty stale. The actors did what they could with the material which was bland. The kid actor's ok but that's not enough to get people to watch it for the rest of the film.There're a few funny moments but not many and honestly, the plot lags on. Whether you're a Christian or not, I wouldn't recommend this film. It's boring and hard to get into. Find something else."
" I love this film
",0.6369,0.9547,2020-07-13 00:00:00,10,"I really like to see the boy's face when he described the heaven. I like the main actress too. She deserves price for best actress. The film also pointed out the fact that even in churches, people are afraid to talk about the afterlife as we don't know much about it. But the humble attitude of the dad really encouraged me. I love the film."
" Beautiful...
",0.0,0.9678,2020-06-30 00:00:00,8,"What a beautiful film, based on real facts, fluffy and nurturing, full of colors and love, the purity of children infects us, the faith, even shaken (at times) of the family, enchants us, passionate, what a beautiful sky ..."
" Very inspirational
",0.5563,-0.0188,2020-06-29 00:00:00,10,"Just finished watching the movie, I found it very heart warming. The movie really hit close to home because my wife and I had lost a child while still in the womb as well. While I have never had doubts about heaven, I certainly have some doubts when people claim to have seen it, since there are so many varying accounts, so who's to say who is a charlatan? I have not read book and presume they included in movie as much as they could, but I found the accounting to be very credible. What I do find sad is that there are some reviewers on here that keep claiming that this boy had recanted his claim later as teen. This is false, there was another boy with a similar claim that DID recant, but not the Burpo kid"
" Enjoyable and comforting
",0.6808,0.9877,2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,"I found this movie enjoyable. The midwestern scenery alone is worth the watch; the wide open fields and small town atmosphere remind me of my childhood.
Greg Kinnear does a great job as Rev. Burpo; the acting is good. It's slow paced but that's part of the enjoyment. It does show some scenes from Colton's vision or visit to heaven, which I enjoyed.
I don't know whether the child actually visited heaven or not. I certainly think it's possible, and doubt that a four year old is sophisticated enough to invent everything he said. He is certainly not the first. So I choose to believe it, and find it comforting.
It's a lovely movie that I will probably watch again."
" This lying boi.
",-0.5267,-0.6876,2020-05-15 00:00:00,1,"The boy came out and said it was all fake. What a jerk. Anyway, this movie still sucks, don't waste your time. It just more trash from filmmakers who can't make films."
" Dont waste your time on this movie
",0.3252,-0.8431,2019-12-30 00:00:00,1,ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS I HATE IT SO MUCH OH MY GOSH
" So and so
",0.0,0.9363,2019-11-12 00:00:00,5,"In some of its parts the movie is quite interesting, but great part of it is just boring when it tries to repeat old questions with the exact old answers. Should this movie in its current form (i.e. in its present form of story / directing / acting) be good enough to induce some debate, or add some idea to another? Absolutely no. So it is not that bad, but not that good either."
" Accurate True Story Movie that I've ever seen
",0.4215,0.8211,2019-08-16 00:00:00,10,"I highly Recommend this Movie It's definitely a Must Watched This Is The Most Accurately True Story Movie that I've have Ever Seen, What I mean that this is The Most Accurate Movie What I mean is that If You watch The Videos on YouTube about These The Real Life People about This Story"
" ""He went to heaven. And then he came back.""
",0.5106,0.6827,2019-08-01 00:00:00,7,"Of course there will be disbelievers regarding a story like ""Heaven Is for Real"", but you also have many such explained phenomena, like people who have passed on a plane flight that went on to crash killing everyone aboard, or those who sense an impending disaster like a hurricane or flood that levels a town. The 1959-1961 television series ""One Step Beyond"" chronicled numerous instances of events that could only be regarded as supernatural or other-worldly. This film can be a deeply moving and spiritual experience for those who question their faith, much as Todd Burpo (Greg Kinnear) did when his son Colton (Connor Corum) began relating his experiences from the other side. The story makes it a point to mention that Colton didn't actually die, though his sensations and observations did resemble those of people who have undergone a near death experience. Pastor Burpo was able to reconcile all those conflicting emotions shared by his wife, his parishoners and himself near the end of the film with that emotional, heart tugging sermon that elevates his congregation in a way that helps all of them understand that Colton underwent a life altering encounter. Personally, I like to keep an open mind on events like this, even if some of the specifics lend themselves to some questioning. The clincher in this story for me was when Colton revealed the identity of an unborn and unnamed sister he met while in heaven, which had to come as a shock to parents who never confided the information to their children."
" Don't listen to haters/ non Christians!
",0.0,-0.2462,2019-03-07 00:00:00,10,"All of the negative reviews you see, do not listen to those! those are the non-believers who try and comparative normal movies today. The story, the idea, it's what really gets to you knowing that I actually happened! Heaven is real, I believe it.....do you?"
" A honey-sweet story based on a lie.
",0.0,0.9572,2019-01-03 00:00:00,2,"I wanted to give this movie a try, and wasted 100 min. It's a lovely, idyllic story of a ""perfect"" family and their little boy who had a NDE, reportedly based on a real life story which was later debunked by the very boy who was supposed to have experienced it. So I'm not even sure why it's still on Netflix. The story might have been believable if it came from a family that does not believe in Jesus and God. But, let's face it, this boy Colton, was born to the reverend and has been hearing bible stories since the moment he took first breath. From technical side the acting was ok. The little boy wasn't fantastic, as some have written, though he is very cute and sweet, but he acts at the level of his age. He repeats what he is told to say. Honestly, the most enjoyable part of this movie were the landscapes and vistas of the Nebraska fields surrounding the Burpo homestead. Otherwise, it's a totally forgettable movie."
" It's o.k. if you don't believe in God....
",0.0,0.4019,2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,Because he believe in you and all of us. I know because their was a time when i was so down and out i thought there was no way out I had a soul searching talk to him and today i'm a happy married man and i truly believe that my prayer was heard. It's understandable for people not to believe but i know it was real.
" Heartwarming Movie
",0.4767,0.0,2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,I've watched this movie on tv several times; I don't think the message ever gets old.
" Excellent story told well
",0.7003,-0.6452,2018-11-22 00:00:00,10,Those who have rated this mo ie very low are criticising their own beliefs not the movie well worth watching moving and totally plausible
" Heaven is for real. The film is fake.
",0.0516,-0.6472,2018-10-02 00:00:00,6,"REAL PLOT SPOILER REVIEWTodd (Greg Kinnear) is a preacher who works one day a week, is given a home and has trouble with bills in a small Nebraska town. After letting his son have a high fever for four days, he takes him to the hospital where the son Colton, (Connor Corum) becomes delusional, sees Jesus and imagines he can act. After being read a story about animals, he claims Jesus had a rainbow colored horse. After a funeral of an old veteran, Colton claims he saw Todd's grandfather. Todd shows him a picture of his grandfather and almost as if prompted, says, yup that is him. The child also knew that mom had a miscarriage and lost a baby, something I knew as a child growing up. i.e. it is not that remarkable that he knew about it. Seems the kid added to the story as things went along.The story allows believers and skeptics to take away what they want from the tale. For Christians it is a feel good story affirmation that their blue-green eyed Jesus with a neatly trimmed beard and curly locks is real. The film supplies enough information for the skeptic as Todd seeks out help and is told, ""There are many explanations.""NEWS FLASH: The young boy Colton has recanted his story. Apparently he didn't see anything when he was out. Don't blame me the kid lied. I am just the messenger. You can search it on line for yourself.This is a far better film than ""God's Not Dead."" For inspirational...try ""War Room."
" The title doesn't sound right for a four year old child...
",0.0,0.7789,2018-07-12 00:00:00,4,"I bought this book for someone else (a family member) I haven't read it myself.
For a 4 year old child to say ""Heaven is for real"" seem strange to me. Does that seem like something a child would say or would it arouse curiosity or interest coming from an adult that would be skeptical, were as a child wouldn't have any doubt."
" Not a bad movie, but that is a family I would not want to be near
",0.1511,-0.9765,2018-07-02 00:00:00,5,"It was a good movie and their handling of a near death expeience was very interesting. But this is a family that I would not want to be near for fear that their tremendous bad luck would be catching. Anything that could go wrong, did go wrong for this family. Miscarriages, broken leg, burst appendix, doubting wife, doubting congregation, etc."
" An alternative for those who are terminal?
",0.0,0.9165,2018-04-03 00:00:00,3,"Currently I'm approaching the autumn of my years and question the existence of an afterlife. Is there a place for our souls to continue after our brief stay on Earth? How are we judged? Do we get our memories erased and are sent back for another try? Or do we just cease totally in darkness? So many infinite questions. I recall a documentary called Beyond and Back made in the late 1970's showing real life experience entwined with near death experiences. The Subject just fascinates me which brings us to this review of the afterlife. Our story centers around a Nebraska Family (The Burpo's). Todd Burpo, (Greg Kinnear) Pastor, firefighter, Husband and Father of two children who lives on the Nebraska plains with his wife Sonja (Kelly Reilly). They live a busy but normal life. As for the Burpo's two children, the older sister Cassie(Lane Styles) typical wide-eyed girl filled with curiosity and our centerpiece the adorable three year old Colton played by Conner Corum. The Burpo's take a trip to the Denver zoo. Older sister Cassie is shown confidently petting a tarantula. Meanwhile timid Conner hides behind his Dad and wants no part of the petting experience. A short time later, the kids contract a stomach flu. Cassie and Colton recover but in Colton's case his fever returns and his temperature eclipses to 104 and is rushed to the hospital. At the hospital, the Burpo' wait and pray . You see Todd in the hospital chapel frustrated, pushing the chairs in disgust as to why their son fell ill? The result was an appendectomy and the surgery was successful. With Colton on the mend , financial strains on the household become burdensome . Todd juggling the Church and his other duties is consumed as subtle statements from the virgin lips of Colton have him astonished. Due to Christian accuracy I had a problem with Colton's depiction of his heavenly experience. For me personally why couldn't Colton meet Moses, Shoshone, Allah or any religious figure. Does this movie preach us to pray the Christian way? That was my only problem with the accounts by the boy. The movie had a suspense to it at times when Colton would reveal his experience in the afterlife. Fine supporting roles by Thomas Hayden Church and Margo Martindale. As for the appearance of the film as a whole . The cinematography extenuates the Nebraska landscape and the vibrant Heaven scenes are worth a look. I still question which denomination is on the other side?"

" Wonderful movie
",0.5719,0.9618,2017-09-03 00:00:00,10,"I read the book. The movie would have been needlessly over detailed with the physical suffering the boy went through. I know people who have read the book, they have since passed away. I am convinced this is a major mind changer to people who live with who knows what for their ideas. The book does outline salvation. It does it with love and very non condemning. It offers hope to those like me who have a number of people who have gone before me. Its only ignorance that offers no hope to the suffering and dying. This is a great book, and movie. I hope people's hearts are changed when they see it. It gave me joy and courage."
" Preachy yes
",0.4019,0.9675,2017-07-17 00:00:00,3,"Despite some reviews saying 'it isn't a preachy movie at all' it is really. While I do like a high sense of morality and a great deal of kindness this movie bears all the marks of religion (as a whole lot of religious ideology is being shoved down the viewers throat throughout the movie). All the (god fearing) people depicted in this movie are extremely kind and goodhearted as well, flawless really. Still I gave this a 3 out of 10 as the acting wasn't all that bad."
" Out-of-body IS in the Bible, so why is this a dilemma for the reverent?
",-0.2204,0.8271,2017-06-12 00:00:00,4,"Out-of-body experiences are in the Bible. Such a shame the reverent did not notice all the passages like ""When Jezus was in the spirit..."". There are many reverences like this. Also in other holy books. This made watching this movies a toe curling experience. The other thing that was just distracting is that these people hardly had any money at all and just kept on living the live like there was no tomorrow. In their huge house, big car and all. Small income family in the US today. YEah right. That is not reality. Maybe they already where in heaven ;)"
" The Great ""What-If""
",0.6249,0.9923,2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"After reading the book on which this film was based, I was excited to see what this adaptation would be like. I was not disappointed, as director Randall Wallace tells a story that doesn't go over-the-top, yet still manages to capture the wondrous story of Colton Burpo and his family.For a basic plot summary (in case you haven't read the book!), ""Heaven Is For Real"" recounts the experiences of young Colton Burpo (Connor Corum), who has a near-death experience and claims to have see Heaven, Jesus, and many other experiences that a boy his age should not have known about relating to passed-away relatives and such. Father Todd (Greg Kinnear) and mother Sonja (Kelly Reilly) don't know what to think: are these experiences real, or did they come from the adrenaline-fueled memories of a preachers son?Basically, if you enjoyed the book, I can't see why you wouldn't enjoy this film as well. It is well- acted, filled with emotion, and touches on the same emotional issues that the book delved into. Besides feeling a bit rushed in the end, ""Heaven Is For Real"" didn't leave me feeling like I was missing any key pieces of the story.Of course, whether or not you believe in God and/or the Burpo's story is central to the emotional components of the film. I believe, and thus it perhaps has a more profound impact on me. I'm not without my doubts, but after reading the book and watching the movie I can't see why this would all just be ""made up"". But that's a bit off topic for this review. Regardless, one can criticize the subject matter if they wish, but I don't think the adaption/presentation deserves any of that criticism.The bottom line? The story of the Burpo family is quite interesting no matter which way you look at it. It poses one of the great ""what if"" questions of the universe: what if you could prove that heaven exists? Would it change the way you lived your life? This film does an excellent job of posing those questions while also telling a tale of family, love, and friendship in the process."
" An interesting and controversial story, although the film is extremely biased and loaded with religious propaganda.
",-0.3597,-0.8796,2017-02-28 00:00:00,5,"In this film, a near-death incident allows a child an unusual view of life beyond death, and is one of the so-called ""Christian movies"", made by US evangelical Christians to propagandize their religion. Throughout the plot, the existence of life after death is taken as a certainty, with scientific explanations being (purposely) unreliable, which makes it hardly suitable for those who don't believe in it. Despite the unfortunate evangelical propaganda, the film presents an interesting problem, valid to any religion or belief system: it confront adults with their own beliefs using a child, reinforcing the idea of ​​innocence, as if a child were unable to lie. Adults say they believe in some things but are always doubting and are unable to deal with any evidence, even if it support their beliefs. That denounces some hypocrisy underlying most religions, including the one who sponsored the film. This is interesting to see and take away some of the propagandistic load that permeates the film, full of feelings but avoiding being corny. I don't know anyone from the cast, but they did a decent job. However, this movie is not a dramatic show. Its worth for it's story and the problem it brings, even if it's spoiled by partiality and religious propaganda."
