" Super political. I like my entertainment to be entertaining.
",0.9022,-0.1251,2018-09-11 00:00:00,1,"If you have a political point of view save it for lifetime or the discovery channel or whatever not in a comedy show. Honestly I don't want to be force fed someone's political view especially when they straight out say they don't like white people. Give me a break what a complete waste of time. I think the line in the movie was ""I don't like white people either"". Can't believe they allowed that line in the movie. If a white guy said this it would armaggedon all over the news and wouldn't be allowed. Total disappointment considering I liked the first two movies"
" Political garbage
",0.0,0.872,2018-08-23 00:00:00,1,"This was supposed to be a comedy like the first two but it was nothing but white-hating political propaganda. That one line in the film that goes ""I don't like white people either"" would start a riot if a white person said that about a black person. I lost a ton of respect for Ice Cube after watching this film. Whatever happened to good old fashioned comedy? This film was a statement, not a comedy."
" Chicago stand up!
",0.0,0.9069,2018-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Calvin ( Ice Cube) owns a barbershop in the infamous South Side of Chicago. He is combined with a salon as both women and men cut hair, although I am not sure why the guys have their hair cut by guys. The group includes a good cross section of characters and personalities. They must deal with the battle of the sexes, including misogyny, raising children, and gang violence. About half way through the film, after good character introductions, they opt to try a cease fire by offering free haircuts on the weekend to rival gang members creating a neutral ground.I was pleasantly surprised. Ice Cube got to play a more serious role in this dramedy. Topics included the Kardashians, R.Kelly, and the word ""fleek."" The shop has more barbers than customers and some characters only appear for a moment and then leave...like Isaac (Troy Garity) a white guy who likes black women. The shop also has an Indian barber (Utkarsh Ambudkar) to give us a different perspective and has to ask permission to say the ""N"" word.Like ""Chi-Raq,"" the film is all about saving Chicago from gang violence, as more successful African-Americans are reaching back. It was a good heart warming comedy/drama with a positive message for Chicago.Guide: 1 F-word I recall from Ice Cube. No sex or nudity. Adult talk."
" Chicago and Calvin's son aren't yet a lost cause....
",0.2411,0.8916,2017-05-31 00:00:00,7,"While I do not think ""Barbershop: The Next Cut"" is as good as the previous Barbershop films, it is still quite enjoyable and has a lot to offer. It also spends a lot of the film focusing on the mess that Chicago has become and some ways to perhaps improve it.Like the previous films, there is a huge cast and very episodic nature to the picture. Many of the same folks from previous films are in this one as well as quite a few female beauticians. The main problems addressed in this one is Calvin (Ice Cube) and his son who is gravitating towards gangs as well as marital trouble one of the men is having...due in part to his wife almost never being home.What I particularly liked about this one was the film half hour or so. Seeing the gang issue tackled and the emotional scenes between Calvin and his son were very satisfying. Overall, not a great film but a worth addition to a very good franchise."
" Big disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.0873,2017-05-18 00:00:00,4,"I was really expecting more from this movie. The story seems to be written by a 10 year old, i got the feeling that most of the actions in the movie happened only to fill the 2hrs, they had the main idea but that would be only 40 min ""let's add some useless actions to make the movie longer"", none of the actors seemed to enjoy being in the movie, the acting was correct but with no passion and dedication to the role they were playing, it looked very fake."
" Forgettable editions, Timeless series
",0.0,0.4655,2017-04-18 00:00:00,6,"First and foremost the depiction of Chicago is just offensive, gang violence is a serious issue but gang members aren't recruiting kids by offering them twice their lunch money. Another glaring problem is the forced celebrity endorsement. Nicki Minaj was sub par and common's acting was awful, and their characters added little to nothing to the actual story line. Even the addition of Anthony Anderson just felt forced, just to add an extra name to the roaster. Now what I love about the film is the return to the roots of the original barbershop movies. The pointless conversations , the banter, and the relatable characters. Growing up these movies were an homage to the everyday experiences of getting my haircut in a barbershop. There was a lot about the movie and quite honestly they could've left this series alone and started something different or given the series an entire reboot because so much of the movie had been changed. I couldn't care for the subplots and new characters but the things I loved about the movie were still there and now that it's on hulu I totally recommend watching it while braiding your daughters hair."
