" This movie is way better then it has any right being.
",0.4404,-0.5221,2021-02-21 00:00:00,6,"We saw a trailer for Into the Storm last night and this had me and Audrey written all over it. It's not a good movie, but it's one hell of a fun one. No performances stood out in particular, there is some comic relief characters who's shtick runs thin pretty quickly. But who over all don't really effect the movie one way or the other, but is there if you into that brand of humor... witch I gotta admit I am.At the end of the day if your like me and enjoy a good disaster movie this is a good one to watch.üëçüèΩ6.5"

If you're like me and don't take films like this too seriously you'll probably enjoy it."
" Lack of sympathy
",0.0516,0.8018,2020-12-15 00:00:00,1,"Poor acting, Twister is still THE BEST tornado film ever and the most realistic. This lacked any feeling or suspense and was very cheesy so if you want to poke fun, choose this. For a real movie, Twister is the one"

" A disastrously boring disaster movie
",-0.7506,-0.3276,2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"When I decided to see Into the Storm, I was hoping that the movie would at least provide me with the same level of suspense and entertainment as Twister, which I found to be a really good flick that only failed to properly develop its characters. Unfortunately, it quickly became obvious that this would not be the case.The first half of Into the Storm was completely uninteresting and it generally gave me the impression that I was watching a cheesy teen movie. Once the focus switched to the tornadoes, there was no change for the better. On the contrary, the film's lack of a proper story became even more blatant and it was complemented by a growing number of instances in which the storm was depicted in an overly theatrical manner, which dropped the credibility factor to the lowest possible level.Last but not least, there were the performances, which were absolutely terrible. For the major part of the movie's running time, I was under the impression that the actors were reading their lines from a screen behind the camera. I could not remember the last time I got to see such unconvincing and emotionless acting. If Twister's main flaw were its bland characters, the characters and the dialogue of Into the Storm brought the definition of blandness to a whole new level."
" Predictable but entertaining
",0.5927,0.7083,2020-10-30 00:00:00,4,"Simple. Action sequences were very good which is why I watched it as I love storms, but the dialogue in between awful, so I ended up forwarding to the good bits by the end. No decent character development.... Which I kind of anticipated so once confirmed it was just a case of watching the tornado action lol."
" Total Saturday afternoon STINKER
",-0.4995,0.7783,2020-10-10 00:00:00,1,"What rubbish, from the tedious teens to ye ha hillbilly's. This is what you'd find on a free cable channel. Dunno why it's on Netflix. This is a very generic version of what's been done well before."
" Cool effects, terrible movie
",-0.2023,-0.4633,2020-10-09 00:00:00,4,"The effects are great, the acting isn't too bad (Richard Armitage phones it in but he can get away with it), the plot/writing is terrible. Lots of cliche lines, you can always tell what's going to happen next and who's going to survive/die, etc.Special mention for the flying cow from every tornado film and the shot of the American flag at the end that's also in pretty much every disaster film."
" A rollercoaster disaster movie
",-0.6249,0.9846,2020-10-08 00:00:00,7,"I have seen a tornado. A real one. It wasn't big, but it was scary. And no, I wasn't looking for one, anyway.
So I felt fine about watching this movie, because I knew it wasn't for real, and to be honest, I felt it was just about pitch perfect for a disaster movie. The visuals are stunning, from the boys toys gadgets (the tornado chasing vehicle is awesome) to the cars flipping all over the place. The action was relentless, so really the plot, such as it was didn't amount to much. But fair play, the actors made the most of it even if Richard Armitage seemed to say nothing much except 'You alright', all the way through, and he is well suited to this kind of film with his toned physique and easy handling of stunts. I loved the camera work, although at times it was hard to see what was going on with all the action. I could not quite figure out all the negative reviews, I felt quite well entertained even though the script was riddled with cliches. You could have easily run this movie without dialogue and understand it perfectly."

" Not that bad
",0.431,0.9451,2020-10-03 00:00:00,5,"Into the Storm is a pretty typical Disaster movie about Tornadoes that has the feel of a well made TV movie. It doesn't has the effects of 'Twister', but they okay, far better than some of the reviews make them out to be. The acting is fine, and the plot, predictable but entertaining. Good movie to pass the time but nothing more"
" Could have been
",0.0,-0.9786,2020-10-02 00:00:00,4,"Tornadoes that appear from nowhere in a split second the ferocity destroys twenty parked cars and hundreds of houses and then seconds later the birds are cheating again, clothing that doesn't move in the gale forced winds, one dimensional acting, no sign of emergency services. This movie is about as bad as modern funeral gets. Storm chasers and adrenaline junkies with a bit of a twister of emotions to be thrown in. Just too much cheese flat acting and desperate let's just forget to plan the scene sort of stuff. Ah what a mess"
" A must see for wild weather film lovers
",0.5267,0.8163,2020-10-01 00:00:00,10,As said previously from a film that had several bad reviews I wasn't expecting a film of this superb quality. Weather scenes are amazing and a good story line as well. I haven't enjoyed a weather film this much since the day after tomorrow.
" Well...a 5 for the CGI and sound
",0.0,0.9659,2020-10-01 00:00:00,5,"I watched it on the launching day on Netflix in my home cinema. Wanted to have a ""premiere"" movie night. Well...the big screen makes the movie look good because the CGI and sound effects are well done. Spectacular and frightening as they really give you the feeling of being into the storm. But I am not sure that it looks as good on a smaller TV screen.
Otherwise the plot is not much, loaded with unrealistic ideas and obvious logical contradictions, with the usual american happy end (""we are strong, good and with faith we will rebuild"") and with actors playing at TV series level. But if you have no other movie planned or you don't know what to watch give it a go. You might like it and find it entertaining. But do not expect a blockbuster. üôÇ"
" Twister by way of Cloverfield(but a less spastic camera POV)
",0.0,0.0806,2020-09-17 00:00:00,6,"Into the Storm is a throwback to 90s disaster movies like Daylight, Dante's Peak and yes even Twister. The movie follows a group of people in found footage format(but very loosely applied) as they traverse their town during a massive storm to rescue their friends. That's really all you need to know going into this movie, the movie knows what it is and what the audience wants and spares no time getting things going. The star of the movies is the harrowing storm sequences and they are really well done. The movie's found footage gimmick is very silly, not only because of the dangers posed by limiting use one of your hands during an impending disaster, but also because the footage shown in no way could have come from any consumer grade camcorder. The movie has a number of characters including storm chasers, ordinary citizens of the town, and two beer swilling would be ""daredevils"" who have ""100s of views"" on Youtube making them big stars(I'm paraphrasing but that's more or less what they say). The characters aren't overly obnoxious and lead to some fun and exhilarating sequences, and if you're a fan of the disaster sub genre the movie's brisk 85 minute running time coupled with its technical craft make it a decent and inoffensive rental for the disaster hungry audience in all of us."

",0.0,-0.9912,2020-07-08 00:00:00,1,"Dear mr. Steven Quale,
I am truly shocked. How can you possibly live with yourself. The wreckage of a movie you created made several people instantly kill themselves. You made every scene, EVERY SCENE, a Point Of View as an excuse to distract the audience of the poor acting and the even worse story. I fell down to my knees after just three minutes of watching, begging and pleading, to please keep the camera straight. But no, the director of this movie decided to spit right into my face and kept disappointing me time after time. He has absolutely no shame. Maybe he thinks it makes him look smart? Instead it makes him look lazy and the viewer will become suicidal. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this film.The ""cool"" tornado hides the fact that the story is empty and the acting is awfulBy the way: There is a scene in the movie where a group of roughly eighty scholars are stuck in a school building, after which the tornado starts wrecking the building. In this abomination of a scene, the camera drops before the screen could show anyone being sucked out of the school. I've never seen such a shameless way of saving the animation team time.I don't usually don't give one star ratings, but this movie made me feel actual anger. So yah,"

" Into the storm
",0.0,0.9275,2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"I caught an advance screening and found it a heck of a ride and thrilling fun to watch. I thought it really delivered the experience of being close up and inside the most power weather on the planet, and left me with images that I continue to chew over with awe. For a ""disaster movie"" it felt extremely realistic, and when you see news reports on TV or YouTube you realize this stuff happens again and again, usually in small towns just like the one in the movie, so it's completely real and they didn't really make any of this stuff up. And I really felt for the characters who, just like real people caught by these events, don't want to be in a disaster movie, they just want to get out of there alive. It got pretty emotional by the end.I don't get all the negative reviews I've been reading, I thought it was really good and delivered a great night out. What do people want, stupid Sharknado? Whatever, I had a good time watching it. And I'm glad I caught it on a big screen instead of renting it later. Seeing it big and overwhelming is the way to go!"
" Both Sides Of The Coin
",0.0,0.9886,2020-06-08 00:00:00,6,"I don't think I have ever seen a movie with such opposing content. 1st, the idea, the pacing, the execution, and my GOSH the special effects are great. There hasn't been better twister graphics since, well, Twister. and then there is the other side of the coin. I cannot imagine it is intentional??? But I have never seen a movie try so hard to DISMISS any sympathy for the ""potential victims"" than this film. Within 20 minutes of beginning, I actually had rolled my eyes so many times at the HORRID dialog of the people (mostly the juveniles) that I had a headache..lol I actually WANTED the twister, for the sake of the human gene pool to wipe out ALMOST the entire town. I doubt that is intentional, but I found myself saying PLEASE kill those 2 idiot rednecks, PLEASE kill that mass of T and A commenting ""kids"". I mean there was pretty much ZERO redeeming value of 95% of the ""kids"" as human beings worthy of reproducing..lol I HAVE teenage boys, and granted everyone is raised differently, but even they do not rattle on in a constant animal house T&A laden way. If this is the way ""teenagers"" act and speak and are obsessed with, we as a race, are doomed.,I think the only juvenile in the whole movie I felt any sympathy for was the environmental girl worried about her term paper/project. It amazed me how a film could be so horrible (Dialog and lack of sympathy/empathy for the targeted potential victims) and yet so good (Idea, the twister team, and those amazing special effects). It's a total dichotomy of a film.So yes, it is certainly fun and worth watching for the storm team and the special effects IF you ignore the dialog of the townspeople and forgive yourself for wishing them (almost all) dead in favor of a better human gene pool, one may begin to look at the twister as a good thing come to help Darwin continue a BETTER gene pool for human survival by erasing that particular town's inhabitants off the map. I have to give the film kudos for producing such a feeling, I've never experienced it before, so I will give it that."

" Fun storm thriller
",0.5719,0.6673,2020-04-25 00:00:00,6,"A quality low budget storm / disaster thriller. The acting is good from the main cast, some of the ancillary characters could have been better. The storm CGI and damage were realistic and made this movie as good as it was. The storyline was well developed and interesting, I usually don't like first person shot films, but it kind of works here. Not bad."
" My family despises me due to how much I dislike this film.
",-0.6808,0.739,2020-04-18 00:00:00,1,"This, This film is-- Is--It's probably the second funniest film ever made-- Scratch that, It's funnier than the previously stated funniest film ever made, Stir of Echoes, This film is so mind-bogging bad to the point where it feels like a parody of films like Twister. It's a hilarious experience that will give you one weird feeling after a while. It leaves a pit in your stomach upon the second watching, and when you begin watching it for the third time, You feel that pit coming. You feel it coming, and it comes and feels deeper and deeper each time you watch it.The acting is hilarious, The female actress doesn't seem like she has any chemistry with her daughter and the main male actor overacts a lot. His overacting isn't as good as Nic Cage, but it comes dang close.The cinematography, Well, I can't say much about it because it's one of those frustrating found footage flicks. There is really no reason for it to be this way other than-- Oh wait never mind. It is because of the most forgettable line/throwaway line in film history of ""School Project that dad forces us to do about some documentary"" and blah, blah, blah.The film isn't original at all. It is somewhat kind of original in the since that it is about crazed-storm-chasers who would make anyone with an actual brain (then again, Why would you be watching this if you had an actual brain like me unless you watched it because your family randomly messaged you and said it was amazing and you wanted to watch it to prove them wrong because you knew it was going to be one of the worst films ever) scream ""YOU FOOL!"" There were comedic relief hillbillies which were the least funniest things about the movie. These characters were awful and the actors were also bad. ""WHY ARE YOU IN THE MOVIE?"" I thought, I screamed at the TV about it and I was thinking ""Why wasn't you written out of the script?"" also.I'm not going to talk about the CGI either. People keep praising the CGI and I have no comment. The CGI wasn't memorable enough to make it stand out, so maybe it wasn't as good as people said? God, I don't know. Just don't watch it. It's the funniest movie ever made, but Stir of Echoes has Kevin Bacon, Into The Storm has Nathan Kress.Never mind, This movie's amazing 10/10 Watch it immediately. /s"
" Next best disaster tale
",0.0258,0.4963,2020-03-29 00:00:00,6,"This was based on an actual tornado that formed from different cells to create a super storm that was hailed as the most destructive force ever recorded. In comparison, scientists ruled that its wind forces of over three hundred miles an hour had equaled to an eighth gale strength of Jupiter's red spot's wind shears. If earth can create such cataclysmic events like what happened in Oklahoma, think of what it will create later on in the future.On a personal note about the movie, I found that the actors did a great job of showing us how desperate we are to understand that our planet is on the brink or tipping point when it comes to weather forces. The music was well matched to the action, but I didn't like the first person type of view when it came to having someone wield a field camera to record everything that went on for a time capsule.It reminded me of Cloverfield or The Blair witch project too much for the effect to settle in, which is why I gave the film six out of ten stars. I think there have been more than enough found footage type of flicks like this one to be desired. If it was just filmed with better scope, or cinematographic viewpoint to widen the tornado's destructive power it would have been more convincing. The effects did a good job at keeping me attentive, but there needed to be extra twister action to keep people riveted.All in all, it was better attempt since Jan de bont's twister. But this installment that graced the screens using a tornado, which broke records around the world told a better story. Scientists couldn't even scale its size beyond F-5, which is scary. Earth in its own way, is a serial killer and it does not have a conscience when it comes to unleashing some of the most horrifying displays of nature with no mercy or regret."

Twister. Of course, there is a notable difference but still. This movie was not bad, but it isn't a classic either. Everything other than the filming style and the visuals were average. The acting was average. The pacing (which honestly, is something i overlook) was average. But that doesn't make it not a heckuva good ride though.

Into the Storm generally feels like a theatrical version of Discovery's Storm Chasers, but with said storm being so spectacularly over the top that any semblance of realism (and therefore suspense) is lost. I mean, it's one thing to have three tornadoes in the same vicinity. It's another to have one of them pick up the fires of a burning house and become a gigantic column of flame. And THEN they join forces and combine into one superstorm (seriously), and begin to pick up jumbo jets and rip trees out of the ground by the roots. I'll admit that it all looks pretty cool, but that's about it. The less I say about the dialogue, the better. This is not recommended."

" Into The Storm blows its severe blustery weather across an incredibly boring story.
",-0.6361,-0.9877,2019-04-23 00:00:00,2,"The essence of a B-Movie is to create something so ludicrous from a low budget, that it actually manifests its own charm. 'Sharknado' for instance. Inherently ridiculous, but you know exactly what you are getting. Into The Storm avoids this classification and instead attempts to convey a serious story, much like 'Twister' or 'The Day After Tomorrow'. Whilst these two carry relatively interesting stories and memorable characters, Into The Storm does not. At all. It believes to have the velocity of a hurricane, but instead has the pacing of a subsiding gentle breeze. It's that bad. A small town is overrun by a ridiculous storm that generates 27 (or so...) tornados simultaneously, to which a group of storm chasers and school students must survive.The colossal tornado had decent visual effects. Oh, and the guy from 'iCarly' is in this and provides a little tiny bit of humour.Well, that's about it. Using a ""found footage"" style, director Quale clearly doesn't understand how the technique works. More often than not, there are aerial views and specific shots that are not produced from a handheld camera that a character is using. More so, we the audience view this after it has been edited by the characters, which adds further fire to Quale's misunderstanding. Speaking of fire, a tornado is set alight. Literally. The only time it harnessed its B-Movie tropes and it leaves you wanting to get sucked into that fiery vortex. The narrative comprises of two sub-plots. A storm chaser wanting to get the ""shot of the century"" (because clearly he didn't watch 'Twister') and a school principal travelling across town to find his son who is trapped in a destroyed factory. Unsurprisingly, these characters are more dull than a blatant CGI tornado leaving a trail of CGI destruction. You don't care for them in the slightest, redefining the word ""boring"". Oh, and the film does that annoying thing when a tornado dissipates immediately after claiming an innocent life. It does this nearly three times.Simply a stormy snooze-fest."
" Come on people, it's a disaster film
",-0.6249,0.5562,2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"I see a lot of reviews trashing this movie. It is after all a disaster film. If you are looking for character development and a deep plot, you should know you are looking in the wrong direction. This movie is campy and great. Basically it is an updated twister. The comic relief is sophomoric, but still good. The whole zombie apocalypse line was great given that Sarah Wayne Callies is in it. So to sum it up, good disaster movie, not gonna win any Oscars."
" WE GOT A VORTEX!
",0.0,0.5856,2019-01-06 00:00:00,7,"The film opens with two subplots. We see the world's worse storm chasers as they haven't been able to film a storm in a year. Running out of funds, they have a chance for one last shoot. While everyone is converging on Riverside, our crew heads to Silverton. In Silverton we see the everyday people being interviewed for a 25 year time capsule at graduation time.This isn't too hard to figure out as the goal of the storm chaser is to film the eye of an EF-infinity tornado, but in this case they must also warn the town folks that regular storm shelters are going to be ineffective against what is headed their way.The storm chasers drive two vehicles. The armor piercing proof Titus which uses gallons per mile...and a blue stretch van that might as well be a target. Much of the film is shown through the annoying hand held camera, a cheap way to build character and make me dislike the film. The storm sequences were done rather well. The heavy bass sound vibrated the floor for an added effect. The storm scenes kept the intensity factor high for a long time. Special effects better than the script and actors.Worth a view if you don't mind watching some home movies too.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."

" Amazing, action-packed, thrill-packed and emotional
",0.6597,0.9803,2018-09-13 00:00:00,9,"It's even better than the Impossible. I love every single scene. It has so much action, Richard's performance was great, and it has some emotional moments i really liked. Special effects were good, direction is fine and it has hilarious moments you really wanna laugh. You laugh, scream, feel awe and cry at the same time. I was just expecting to be a bit longer. That's why i put 9 instead of 10."
" A Made for TV, Twister remake. CGI is good though.
",0.4404,0.908,2018-08-05 00:00:00,3,"Twister isn't the best film ever, but In to the storm is a total waste of money. At first I actually liked this film! Good action and ok CGI! But I rewatched it and it sucks! The acting is trash, the only good thing is the CGI... it's a fun movie though.."
" It's no Twister!
",-0.3595,0.788,2018-06-12 00:00:00,3,"Into the Storm is a pretty poor remake of ""Twister,"" except devoid of feeling and triumph.You have several different stories about characters we simply cannot care about, that they're trying to make us care about and a bunch of cool tornadoes. In ""Twister,"" along with the quality characters there's a sense of momentous achievement being witnessed and the strive for one's long journey to be reached, through all the heartache along the way. This film just kinda plots you in and says care about these people, well no I didn't. However not unwatchable and somewhat thrilling. I liked the tornado lifting the Pete character into the sky. He got to live out his dream, except he didn't get to share it and then plummeted to his death.The time capsule idea, while poorly executed in the film, seems like a great premise for a fun film or horror or whatever if not already been done."
" Better than expected.
",0.4404,0.9811,2018-06-08 00:00:00,6,"Having watched 'Twister' (which I thoroughly enjoyed) I was hesitant watching this, as I thought it was pretty much going to be a 'Twister' mockbuster. I couldn't have been more wrong. This was bloody awesome! I enjoyed everything about this film: the look and feel, the characters, the actors, the story, and the visual effects were FANTASTIC.The found-footage style filming blended with regular filming lent more realism to the story and characters. It really sold the story to me and believed the characters were really in the storm. The video time capsule idea was an interesting way of introducing the characters and their back stories. I thought that was very original. The film was super exciting and incredibly well done. Once the action starts, it doesn't let go until the awesome finale. This is the type of film I can watch again and again - even if it is just for the visuals, and the good story and acting is an added bonus."
" We need a tornado...
",0.0,0.9656,2018-06-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie really took my by surprise, especially since I had initially expected to be another one of those mass-produced, questionable disaster movies with bad CGI effects, laughable acting and a lack of plot. But it turned out that ""Into the Storm"" was anything but that.This was really one of the best disaster movies that I have had the fortune of stumbling upon which I did by sheer random luck.The storyline was good, and it wasn't the usual small group of people beating Mother Nature with time running out and saving the entire world. So that was a refreshing change of pace.They had some really nice actors and actresses on the cast list, whom were doing great jobs in bringing their characters to life on the screen.Now what really blew me away was the CGI effects and the sound effects. It was just phenomenal. And I am thrilled to find movies like this to use with my sound system, as this movie really had some impressive sounds. The whole sound in itself was really a layer that added so much to the movie.If you enjoy disaster movies, then you should definitely give ""Into the Storm"" a go. It is rare that an outstanding disaster movie comes along, ""Into the Storm"" turned out to be one of those rare instances."
" Well made, well acted, excellent special effects.
",0.8625,0.9766,2018-04-16 00:00:00,10,"I read all the reviews, and all the negative ones. This movie was not a disaster flick. It was well made throughout.This was an excellent and very well acted disaster movie. Easily 10/10. The special effects were top notch.All it takes to enjoy any disaster movie is a little imagination.So, grab some popcorn, sit back on your chair, and prepared for a thrill ride."
" Smashing
",0.0,0.9091,2018-03-13 00:00:00,6,Almost TV movie. The wrath of goad in the twister dance. Twisters come and come again until there is no footage. Pretty good special effects and a visit to heaven. Silly but satisfies like godzilla.
" Not all that good but not terrible, just very B movie-ish.
",0.3875,-0.6844,2018-03-01 00:00:00,6,"I love a good disaster movie, this was, well not all that good but not terrible, just very B movie-ish. For some reason I was expecting more. Its on the level of a made for TV Sy Fy movie just with a bigger budget for special effects, following fearless storm chasers who risk their lives in order to collect data on an unprecedented weather pattern that unleashes multiple tornados on a small town, meanwhile the terrified locals race for shelter at the local high school. Unfortunatly there also aren't any interesting characters to get invested in here, everyone is pretty bland, the two boys and the high school dad moderately caught my attention and the teens trapped in the collapsed paper mill filling with water but it wasn't anything I hadn't seen before. There are also randomly a couple of Walking Dead alumni in the cast with Sarah Wayne Callies and the chick from Fear Alycia Debnam-Carey.The formulaic storyline doesn't help, its just there to tie all the tornados together so that the whole thing becomes totally forgettable, like a cheap Twister without Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton to care about. I've seen it all before, dull.I will say the fire tornado was very cool."
" Force five action.
",0.0,0.8171,2018-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Admittedly, Into The Storm is almost identical in terms of story to Jan De Bont's 1996 disaster movie Twister, but it still manages to be an exhilarating ride thanks to its incredible special effects-laden tornado scenes which deliver jaw-dropping destruction on a massive scale.As with De Bont's film, the film revolves around a group of professional storm-chasers who are on a mission to film a tornado from the eye of the storm. Arriving in the small town of Silverton, Oklahoma, they experience a frightening meteorological phenomenon - multiple vortices that combine to create the biggest tornado on record.Director Steven Quale spends the first half an hour introducing his stock characters - the members of the storm-chasing team, the locals of Silverton to add emotional drama, plus a couple of thrill-seeking rednecks for comic relief - and then spends the remaining hour or so throwing them into life-threatening situations, with the occasional unfortunate being whipped into the sky never to be seen again.It's predictable, formulaic popcorn action for sure, but hugely entertaining nonetheless, with the chaotic wind-lashed finale providing satisfyingly catastrophic edge-of-the-seat thrills."
" read review before looking at my rating...
",0.0,-0.2679,2017-11-29 00:00:00,5,"this movie are an amazing feature when it comes to the use of vfx technology.some of the scenes were so stunning, giving a sturdy man well overweight by tons of hours in front of the screen having to take a tight grip on the sofa cushion to avoid being absorbed by the tornado a smashing 10,er to that. the downdraft of the movie is terrible acting,caused by a terrible storyline and a terrible lack of insight of today's weather measurement devices, e.g. the 1950-style anemometer on the titus is a disgrace to all of us that has meteorology as a hobby or profession,even the cheapest weather station from DAVIS could outnumber that. also the setup of cameras on the titus were laughable,especially the globe cam near ground level aka ''splash cam''...... so giving this part of entertainment a 0 (zero),the median are a 5...... Twister are still the best...."
" A survival story presented as documentary...
",0.0,-0.5518,2017-10-24 00:00:00,8,"I had only ""heard"" of this film from my times reviewing IMDb to see what films Alycia and Sarah had been in and noticed they were both in this one, so it was must watch because I am a fan of both actors.I did not expect to like the film as much as I did! I am a hardcore fan of Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton's Twister and can watch it anytime I see it on television, so a movie about stormchasing I thought would have the same feel as Twister, but this one felt like fresh storytelling.This had drama, action, suspense, horror (imagine having a building collapse on you and water filling up the spaces so high that you are floating underwater, hanging on for dear life so you don't die while being suffocated)...my only criticism is I wish it hadn't ended so abruptly after the storm had passed. I would have like the story to continue on and wrap up in some way when it came to Allison and Gary's chemistry."
" Another movie about twisters
",0.0,-0.7138,2017-08-28 00:00:00,5,"I will admit that the special effects in this film are extremely impressive. From that angle, you are catapulted along with the story, but really? another movie about tornadoes??? And with the same tired formula: father has lost wife and teenage children have become distant from him. Enter disaster and challenge and they come to each others aid, and in so doing, become bonded again as family. ""I love you Dad!"" :-) Or the mean guy obsessed with making $$$ so much, that he risks the lives of others to get video of an approaching storm. But as I said, for effects, this film rocks!"
" The visuals will blow you away!
",0.0,0.9365,2017-05-08 00:00:00,7,"Into the Storm is a fun thrill ride that quite literally takes you into the storm. The realistic visuals and accurate depiction of tornadoes are a big upgrade from the ones of twister. If you're a weather enthusiast and if you're wanting to watch the movie for just the action and not the characters I recommend you watch it, if not then you should watch Twister since you get both. While this film doesn't beat Twister, it does a nice job on not only reminding you of it, but also it does something new that should be appreciated as such.Overall while the film is weak on character development, the amazing special effects makes up for it."
" Not Much Here
",0.0,0.4985,2017-04-10 00:00:00,4,"Because crazy special effects have become the norm, we are back to judging movies on whether they tell a good story. This is about as clich√©d and predictable as can be. It starts out well with an incredibly drive, myopic leader of a storm chasing team, near the end of his rope because it has been so long since he got anything on film. We also have the too busy dad whose sons resent him because he demands too much of them. Isn't that sad. Of course, he lost his wife at some point. And the female lead lost her husband. And, well. The one boy gets the courage up to ask the hot girl have anything to do with him and they end up in danger. The storm chaser guy is responsible for the death of a kid and then he will die in a heroic way righting his wrong. The storm scenes are intense but we must remember that many of them are there because of their chosen profession. And finally, it has that sappy, syrupy ending, blah, blah, blah. It has excitement and it's very loud, but it's just not a very good film."
" Searching for a tornado, that's about it.
",0.0,0.1388,2017-03-16 00:00:00,5,"I normally do like disaster movies. Most of the time the story isn't a surprise, you just know what you will get before watching it. With Into The Storm it's the same. You know it's going to be about tornado hunters and that's basically what you get. So don't expect much more than a bunch of tornado hunters driving around to find a good spot (preferable right in the eye of the tornado) to study the ultimate monster tornado. A lot of disaster and damage, with a couple of casualties. That's what you get. But to me it was just not good enough. The computer generated images were not that good, you could clearly see that it's fake. The acting was also a bit dull and boring. Not good enough to be remembered."
