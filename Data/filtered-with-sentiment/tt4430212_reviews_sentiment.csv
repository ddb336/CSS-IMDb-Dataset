" DRAMA AND SUSPENSE
",0.0,0.8873,2021-04-04 00:00:00,10,It is an excellent film from India; it has good acting and a suspenseful plot. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!
" Great acting, stupid premise
",0.1779,0.7074,2021-03-07 00:00:00,5,"Blow to head results in concussion, not instant death!!!They should have rewritten the first 20 minutes of the movie to make it more sensible. They could have achieved the same plot but with a smarter premise."
" Absolutely Top Class !!!
",0.4532,0.9921,2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,"Expectations were very high after watching the original movie but after seeing this I am 100 percent sure that none other than Ajay Devgn could justify the role of Mohanlal Sir as he did in the original one. This is pure class of acting superbly led by Ajay Devgn, Tabu, Shriya Sharan and others. This is one of the finest remakes ever made in Bollywood Cinema. Ajay Devgn as Vijay Salgaonkar and Tabu as IG Meera Deshmukh as just terrific in there respective characters.A bone chilling story with an excellent cast and a perfect climax - what else we need ! Even after the run time of the movie is around 2hrs 43mins it makes sure that we don't leave our seat till the movie is completed. It clearly shows that how far a man can go to save his family which was involved in an ""Unintentional Murder."" A Perfect Remake in Hindi Language."

Mohan Lal is best of all.. If you doubt it, watch the original and first version completed by Mohan Lal...."
" One of the finest sequels
",0.0,0.9184,2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Mohan Lal is back with a bang. His act as a father who is ready to do anything to save his family looks so genuine. The movie has a solid grip and twists to make it a must-watch.The story begins where the first movie ended. Mohan Lal is now the owner of a movie hall. He has a solid bond with his wife and daughters. Though his wife and daughter are still going through the mental trauma caused in the first movie. The police are still investigating the murder and Mohan has to save his family, once again.The subtle beginning may look a little stretched but the movie offers an engaging plot that has plenty of twists. Another thing about the movie is that it doesn't look desperate to cash in the success of the first movie.Knowing that one day they will get caught, the natural element of fear and anxiety will be felt throughout. The writing retains empathy for the family without making them look like villains. Further, Murli Gopi as a strong-headed policeman and Anjali in a supporting role is another gem to check out.In the end, Drishyam 2 is a rare movie that manages to complement its origin.
Whatte story.
Whatte acting.
Whatte movie.
Watch it right now.Do like and share it with someone who's a mad fan of movies."

" The psychological duel fought between a layman n a top cop is heart pounding.
",-0.128,0.9392,2020-12-30 00:00:00,10,"My earlier review which i posted on 31st July 2015 and which got more than 100 likes got deleted. Must be some blind bhakt who aint fond of this movie or my review or must be some fan boy who must hav got pissed off thru my imdb reviews.
Unfortunately, there r countless blind bhakts n countless fan boys in my beautiful India.I saw this movie with my entire family in a theatre n that too, first day, first show.This aint ur regular Bollywood trash as there aint no songs, no dance, no unnecessary shirtless stuff, no gravity defying badly choreographed action, no jingoism n no melodrama.This one is a taut thriller with a superb performance by Ajay Devgn. He lost all his muscles n got into the skin of the character.
His plain shirt, trouser n slippers act is convincing as a common person. Devgn is terrific n he nailed the character.The other guy who played Gaitonde is superb too.
Audiences were cheering when he gets a beating. Such was the impact of his devilish act.
It reminded me of a real life incident i read about.
I read that many fellas in real life were very angry due to John Carradine's character shooting Jesse James (1939 version) at the movie's end. They say a young boy kicked John Carradine on his shoe during the premiere.Coming back to this film, it is full of tension n suspense throughout n the twist in the end makes it a top notch cerebral film.
The saddest scene is the one where the character of Tabu n her onscreen husband anticipates their son's arrival whenever the door bell rings.This one is better than Suspect X, Perfect Number n The Devotion of Suspect X.
All are based on the 2005 novel The Devotion of Suspect X by Keigo Higashino."
" Soulless remake.
",0.0,0.9081,2020-12-26 00:00:00,1,"This film is a remake of Drishyam (2013). This is a shot to shot remake, absolutely everything is the same. Every shot, every action, every dialogue line and everything is completely the same as in original. The only reason why this remake exists is because it is in different language. So instead of dubbing or subtitling the original they just remade it in their own language instead... It is a disgrace to the original work and is completely soulless movie. If you remake a film you have to change it, so it has individuality over the original, so you know that it is a remake and they tried something different this time, but here they didn't even try in the slightest. While on it's own it's a great film, it's just a replica and has no value whatsoever.
It's completely same as if the original was Mona Lisa real painting and this film is just a poster of the painting..."

",0.6249,0.9984,2020-07-14 00:00:00,10,"A masterpiece. The best sout h remake ever made in bollywood. DRISHY AM REVIEW- Hell yeah, just watched the Masterpiece, gem of thriller. Wow is the only word is in mout h now for this movie. Heard a remake of national award Malayalam movie is coming in bollywood and i was just waiting like anything for this movie. Trailer didn't offered much but it was promising. Then critics reviews came which took my expectations to sky level. And finally after watching it i must say movie worths it. A rare thriller which was made to look realistic only not as filmy masala content. First half takes time to set platform, sets movie plot then 2nd half blows you away with its masterclass planning and scenes. A simple plot, a common man who is 4th std failed not much educated tries to hide his family's crime from so called educated police officers. But the content and screenplay is so realistic that it makes this simple story a masterpiece. Even a Lo ng runtime of 2 hrs 40 mins looks too tight and glues us to Our seat. W riter has done an extraordinary job, people will not forget this story in lifetime. Kudos to him and screenplay maker. Music wasn't much needed for movie,still 1 song after interval is situational which plays important role to make scene much tight. Entire star cast acted like real incident and really made me feel that its all happening in real in front of me. Ajay devgn the man who is the soul of this movie. His acting is just out of the world. Those intense eyes, innocent expressions, scary scenes and some emotional scenes as if this movie made for his acting only. Surely best performance of the year till date and i don't think someone will give better performance than him in this year at least, he deserves an award for this movie. Tabbu role is exactly half to Ajay according to runtime of movie. She did whatever expected from her role. Other star cast did fab job, each and every actor gave his best for their roles. Director Nishikant Kamat proves his skills and talent metal again here. He never left movie's grip till the end. Even the last ending scene of the movie was watchable and gives goose bumps. Hats off to him. He already had remake in hand which made direction much easier so there was no chance to make movie a crap. Overall a must watch for all. Only kids wont understand it, but ot her audience like classes, masses, youngsters and even seniors will love it. Go for this one, take 3 hrs from your life and enjoy the rare and the best thriller ever made in bollywood. Don't miss, you cant afford to miss this masterpiece. Here we have got the best movie of 2015. Last line, 'Its like,'Shawshank Redemption in bollywood. üòç"

",0.7783,0.8309,2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,"This is Indian cinema at its finest- high on thrills, low on cheese. Of course, this is a remake of the 2013 Malayalam film of the same name. Rather than a full review, I just want to sort of compare the two, because this remake had some hits and some misses in how it went about remaking the film.First, the casting. Mostly a big hit. The age difference between the mother and eldest daughter was the only unbelievable part. The gorgeous Ishita Dutta is a standout in this film as the eldest daughter Anju. Ajay Devgn is spectacular as the lead, and Prasanna Ketkar is so much like his original counterpart as the principal antagonist in the Malayalam version that it's a bit eerie.The other big advantage this film has over the original is that the protagonist seems a lot smarter. In my opinion, this fixes one of the few flaws that the original film had. In that film, the IG figures out Georgekutty's plan in one fell swoop, and all of the witnesses almost line right up to say ""August 2nd! August 2nd!"" almost in succession. This film fixes that problem, making his plan less obvious and it unravels in a more slow and suspenseful way.The one area that I miss from the original is the emphasis on the protagonist's passion for films and his background as an uneducated orphan. People sometimes complain about the slowness of the 2013 film's first act, but I actually prefer it because it contains the background necessary to grasp what is one of the primary points of the film, even lending to the title ""Drishyam"" (""visuals"" or ""scenes""). This film covers all of that in brief passing, but I would have preferred a little more of a look into his background."

AD acting is just remarkable so is Tabu, trying her best to extract evidence.The first half an hour of the story line establishing the character of AD is a bit boring but then onwards it's full of climaxes one after another.

Seeing Sam's behavior in the middle was really anxious to rush into the screen to stop him. Then I saw that some people at the police station abused the punishment, and it became more and more felt that Vijay's behavior of ""violent violence"" was quite correct, and that was still a helpless act of their family.

",0.5859,0.9878,2020-02-28 00:00:00,8,"""Drishyam"" is Drama - Crime movie in which we watch a family getting into a dark and unexpected situation, and the father does whatever is possible not only to protect his family but also to avoid any possible negative outcome.I enjoyed this movie very much because it was very interesting from the start of it until the last minute. It had also much of suspense and some plot twists that made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Nishikant Kamat was simply amazing and the interpretations of Ajay Devgn who played as Vijay Salgaonkar, Shriya Saran who played as Nandini Salgaonkar and Tabu who played as I.G. Meera Deshmukh were simply excellent. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am absolutely sure that you will like it a lot and in some moments it will leave you speechless."

" One can learn surprising things from movies
",0.2732,0.9236,2020-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Drishyam, literally meaning 'visuals', is a Hindi-language crime mystery thriller about a upper middle-class family that comes under the scrutiny of police when they're suspected of murder of a young man who has powerful ties with the local authorities. Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn), the father, must do everything he can to keep his family from going to prison, utilizing every legal and illegal trick he has learned as a lifelong movie buff.A fine example of how a good script can elevate a movie. Because to be honest the acting is not a strength of this film. Devgn is very good, which helps a lot, as is Tabu as Inspector General Meera Deshmukh, but all the rest are either rather wooden or a bit too over the top.But that doesn't really matter because it's really a movie about Devgn's character and how he continuously outsmarts the police. The greatest thrill of the film is finding out just how long he can keep up the juggling act without Tabu's character finally nailing him to the wall.And it's a good juggling act. The classic crime thrillers are more about ""who did it"", but this is a great example of a smaller subgenre tentatively called ""will they get caught"". And in executing the conventions of that subgenre is where this film shines.Recommended. Especially if you're looking for a Hindi film that's about more than singing, dancing and jumping around."

The entire rest of the film tugged me back and forth between highly tense anxiety and amazement, and it weaved between the two emotions so expertly that I was laughing with giddy wonder during the most climactic reveals.The acting was also very good, especially Devgn (Vijay) who always seemed like he held total control in even the most desperate situations. Tabu (Inspector General) gave an increasingly excellent performance as the movie progressed. At first I thought she was breaking character, but I soon realized her character was also playing a character whose shell slowly cracked and fell away as the situation became increasingly dire. I did think Saran (Vijay's wife) gave a subpar performance, but it wasn't bad enough to break my immersion in this masterfully crafted story."

First quote - 'Everything I learned I learned from the movies' -- Audrey Hepburn;Second quote - 'You know what your problem is, its that you haven't seen enough movies - all of life's riddles are answered in the movies' -- Steve Martin.This movie is a testament to the above two quotes.A father, a private cable movie operator, who is only 4th class (grade) pass is suddenly engulfed in a crisis starting with the sexual harassment of his school going daughter. The movie is about how he deals with the family crisis.The movie is gripping, suspenseful and without a dull moment. There is no hitch or element of implausibility in the entire narration.Director Nishikant Kamat has done three movies, Dombivli Fast (2005), Mumbai Meri Jaan (2008) and Drishyam (2015), and it is difficult to say which is better than which....all of them have been very well appreciated.Ajay Devgn has given a memorable performance. Tabu gives a very excellent act in the last scene with Ajay Devgn and Rajat Kapoor, where her son's fate is tacitly revealed and she is left to quietly bear the devastation of his loss. Kamlesh Sawant (as Inspector Gaitonde) has acted very well.Most of the key actors in the movie are women - Tabu, Shriya Saran, Ishita Dutta, Mrunal Jadhav. They have all done well.Rajat Kapoor was just like an emotionless prop, although he is a grieving father.The remaining actors also have acted well.The film poster has been designed very well.

Family is more than anything.
As a Father, Vijay has a responsibility to protect, to take care, to give a peaceful situation to his family.
Drishyam shows us how important is our family.
How struggling the father to take care the family, but then the stranger broke it all.
This movie shows us a family chemistry as it best.
Every actor and actress do their role dramatically.
Minor is at its cinematography technic, sometimes we see people blocking, raw edit at transitions, and out of focus to object.
but
The strongest element from this movie is at its story, it's smart telling, mindblowing, and touching. It can elevate this movie's soul, it can make us all ignoring minor flaw.

Ajay Devgn gives a real ""pater familia"" performance and in my humble opinion the Jeethu Joseph's script is to remain a classic not only for Indian cinema but cinema as a whole.

",0.0,-0.9719,2018-05-07 00:00:00,6,"Whilst taking part in the French film challenge on ICM in April,a friend told me about a Bollywood Thriller he had seen on Netflix. Finding the long run time to be an interruption with the challenge,I decided to save the title for viewing on the May Day Bank Holiday.View on the film:Re-making Jeethu Joseph's 2013 Malayalam film Drishyam, director Nishikant Kamat & cinematographer Avinash Arun gather round the Salgaonkar's with artful group shots that capture the sharp intake of breath over they each take over telling the correct lies. Digging up the family secrets, Kamat and Arun dip the film in deep red lights and long shadows that steam up a gritty atmosphere over the battle of wits between Vijay and Meera Deshmukh. Holding tightly on to his family, Ajay Devgn gives a great performance as Vijay, whose roar of aggression when family is threatened is threaded by Devgn with a calculating calmness.Swaggering in as her officers beat up suspects, Tabu gives a Inspector General Meera Deshmukh, who is attacked by Tabu with a brute attitude that gives the psychological and physical violence Deshmukh dishes out a sting that leaves her male officers hiding in the corner. Taking inspiration from Keigo Higashino's book The Devotion of Suspect X, the screenplay by Upendra Sidhaye spends the first half layering the bonds between the Salgaonkar's and thrillingly placing them on their slippery attempts to build alibi's for the murder. Making the lies of the family tight,Sidhaye takes the mystery to a dead-end,which leads to horrible wrong turns as Vijay trips himself to revealing all with poorly-written exposition being shoved into the dialogue and dimming the wickedly macabre twist ending, as the last shovel of dirt is placed on the family plot."

",0.2481,0.8899,2017-11-13 00:00:00,9,"It's easy to feel conflicted about the story presented by ""Drishyam"". After all, there's an unjustified death that took place, and an entire family gets behind a plan to cover it up. To my thinking, the kid Sam was a victim of manslaughter and not attempted murder, but not knowing how the law deals with these things in India, I'd have to assume that the penalty would have been almost as severe as actual homicide. When Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) decides that he'll pull out all the stops to protect his family, the intrigue and suspense mounts in this rather offbeat thriller.The other facet of this story that baffles me somewhat is why teenage daughter Anju (Ishita Dutta) became so distraught over the cell phone video. At first one doesn't know under what circumstances she was recorded, but it's eventually revealed that she merely went into a bathroom to change her clothes and the peeping Sam caught her in a state of undress. It's not as if she were intentionally engaging in a pornographic film. But again, different cultures look at things differently, and teenagers in particular aren't amenable to rational thought at times. So one can understand why she took matters into her own hands when Sam came calling.The odd thing that occurs over the course of the picture is that the viewer finds himself siding with Vijay and the family over the cover up. That's made easier of course by the corrupt methods of the IG of Goa, portrayed by Indian actress Tabu, as well as the brutal tactics of Inspector Gaitonde (Kamlesh Sawant). If he couldn't get the three eldest members of the Salgaonkar family to crack, it was pretty much a foregone conclusion that he would have forced young Anu (Mrunal Jadhav) to talk. But by the time the authorities arrived to dig up the family's backyard, and seeing to what lengths Vijay had already gone to cover the family's tracks, I had a strong suspicion he had tampered with the grave. It was only a matter of suspense to find what he replaced Sam's body with.Apparently this movie is a faithful remake of another Indian film with the very same title, which I find intriguing in one respect. As I write this, the film under consideration here is ranked in IMDb's Top #250 for 2016, but sits at #21 on the best films of India, while the original ""Drishyam is #2. How that anomaly occurs I wouldn't know, but it's an interesting little side note. To my mind, I think the ending of film would have been better served without the final confrontation between the Deshmukh family and Vijay, though I did find some irony in the idea that Sam was reburied under the floor of the new prison."

Using his TV knowledge, he helps an elderly couple get their son out of jail from a corrupt system where a crooked cop extorts from the locals. He's a father-knows-best at home. When creepy Sam threatens his daughter Anju with a peeping Tom video, Anju and his wife Nandini inadvertently kills him. Vijay sets off to hide the crime against Sam's unrelenting, ruthless police chief mother.I wasn't sure what this movie was going for at first. There is a bit of light tones which confused me a little. The first act needs to be tighter and darker. This does turn much darker with a hint of The Usual Suspects. The dates concerned me a little but the movie throws it a very nice reveal. The other concern is Sam's mother. She's definitely not a simple villain although a much darker villain may be better. I appreciate seeing both sides of the crime but it does make for a more complex narrative. I can see this being remade into a dark, stripped-down noir."

So you cannot even in your wildest dream expect this movie to be entertaining in a traditional way. Coming at the storyline, I am not going to repeat it as it is already there several times. There are situations when you cannot judge/or call a person to be criminal just because of what he did. Instead, even he is a criminal in the eye of the law, you would support him after knowing the full story. Just a philosophic thought here; are all the so called 'criminal' are really criminal - or you would support him and will not judge him as guilty if you know why he had made that action. The movie is unpredictable - at least to the general viewers. I have never met anyone who had climax that he had anticipated the climax before it happened. Being a general man, we usually keep distance from the unwanted problems. But what you would do if problems comes itself to your door? Would you surrender to it or fight against it. But there is another way. Heard a proverb where it said that aim to the storm in such a way that it works in favor of you.
