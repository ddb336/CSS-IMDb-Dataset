" One Man Made History Of The Twin Towers
",0.0,0.9537,2021-01-22 00:00:00,10,"This film was a remarkable true story of a frenchman who walks on a wire above the between the twin tower of the world trade center. While I'm watching the film, it's bring me tries to my eyes and realizing that those twin towers is not about that terrible event later in 2001, those twin tower is about this event in 1974 when this story take place in the film. Philippe wants to share the world for what he did is possible, and it happened. This film made me love this film even more then Back To The Future and The Matrix.Robert Zemeckis has done a lot of great films like Forrest Gump and Who Framed Roger Rabbit and etc. But this one is the best film then any other films."

" Don't watch this if you have a bad stomach.
",-0.5423,0.9658,2020-08-19 00:00:00,7,"I was amazed that someone could think of something so outrageous and really do it. And I was surprised that there were people who didn't do it alone, but who sided with these things in many ways.
Until the middle of the movie, I thought it was boring because of the usual epidods that was going on, but the climax of the movie was very exciting.
As I had a projector in my room, I was able to enjoy the best part of this movie.By the way.
I'm not as honest as you are, so I'm not inclined to see this movie and immediately believe that this is a true story. No matter how condition of a day it is on top of such a tall building, it is natural for a strong wind to be blowing. Also, skyscrapers sway slightly when the wind hits them. Wires stretch and slacken. I don't think there is no way to plan to cross the building. If they really did, it must have been a systematic and detailed plan, and they must have waited for a day when there was no wind to cross it. So this must be a made up story, just like the one that happened in 2001."
" The walk review
",0.0,0.981,2020-07-22 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie. I was never bored not even a second. I wanted to know what was gonna happen next. The story, plot, acting, characters, and character development was all greatly done. There was a lot of emotions I felt well watching this movie. When he was on the high wire between the two twin towers I had so many emotions like scared that he might fall off or happy to see he made. This story is super family friendly. Great for all ages to watch and enjoy. This is a drama. I highly recommend everyone watch this."
" Wonderful beyond reason
",0.5719,0.417,2020-07-22 00:00:00,10,"Ok, it's not a perfect movie, and the early part drags.But, wow, Gordon-Levitt knocks it out of the park as Philippe Petit. Petit is an arrogant ass! But he earned it!It feels like a legend that this even occurred, but it did! Almost as much a present to America from the ""frogs"" as the Statue of Liberty.The walk itself is just jaw dropping."
" visual feast
",0.0,-0.177,2020-05-23 00:00:00,7,"""The Walk"" to describe Philip Patty's growth is not successful, but to capture important segment in the process, together with his life colorful movement of the early stage, the ground seemed dull and laundry list of the film, with the perspective of the narrative of the self as judged and important means of the plot, and a collage of a paragraph, and to the point of rendering, simply but it is lack of what, Hollywood practices make the film seem very skillful, but it's not a lasting appeal, the climax of the film is concentrated in the back across the process of twin towers is careful and even with the artistic temperament, The sense of tension and the sense of process can be fully appreciated. In particular, the scene of a high tower walking along a rope brings a visual shock. Only when the depth from top to bottom is too suitable for 3D and wide screen, can I deeply feel the power of technology."
" If afraid of heights don't watch this movie
",0.0,0.1779,2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Last 1/2 hour is amazing. I am afraid of heights and this movie made me scared even when they were just standing on top of the buildings, let alone when he was crossing on the wire"
" Will have you on the edge of your seat and a wonderful insight on Philippe Petit's passion for tightrope walking.
",0.7717,0.8671,2020-05-17 00:00:00,10,"Another exceptional film from the wide array of movies director Robert Zemeckis has worked on. Truly portraying Philippe Petit's passion for tightrope walking and his dream. The film showed us how he fell in love at a young age and never looked back, constantly working to prefect his craft. The cinematography and CGI was beautiful, amazingly portraying how large and magnificent the Twin Towers were, and a wonderful homage to them. Also shows just how high up Philippe walked above the streets of Manhattan, a stomach turning feeling. In some clips, the CGI looked a little strange, but for a $35 milllion dollar budget, you cant complain. Overall, loved the story, screenwriting, directing, and just an incredible movie overall."
" Wow.
",0.5859,0.9771,2020-05-09 00:00:00,8,"As was mentioned in my ""Man on Wire"" review, I watched ""The Walk"" before the actual documentary of Philippe Petit himself.This film is incredible. I love people's stories because each individual in this life has something unique to share. But Philippe Petit took a major risk to perform a major act that would allow him to accomplish a dream of his.It's not even to emphasize that his accomplishment was more special than others, but the fact that Philippe cared so deeply about his work and he got all the close friends around him to help him.And not only does he do the walk once......he does it multiple times!"

The film will also provides some great messages which I promise will only lift you up. The film only has a couple of small let downs such as the support actors & love interest story that at times doesn't feel like they belong. We are provided a couple of scenes that dragged on or we can predict what happens next, but after i'ts a film all based on true events....These issues of mine are all very minor from a great film of 2015"
" What An Experience!
",0.0,0.955,2020-02-28 00:00:00,10,"I saw this film in 3-D IN NYC. I give it a ""10"" just for the last 40 minutes or so dealing with the preparation for the ""Walk"" and of course the ""Walk"" itself. The recreation of the ""Walk"" between the Twin Towers and the vast panorama of the city beneath the Walker's feet was absolutely amazing, CGI at its very best. I liked the rest of the film as well, along with the cast. There was lots of humor as well as suspense, including the ""Walk"" between the Towers of Notre Dame. BTW, I saw the film in 2-D afterwards and still loved it. It is magical, inspiring and poetic. Ignore all of the negative reviews."
" Suspenseful And Daring
",0.3612,0.9664,2020-01-02 00:00:00,7,"This movie was a treat, the first half was pretty slow I found, but the middle and last act were amazing. However, throughout the whole movie Joseph narrates as Philippe. This works to an extent, but at times it feels like an easy cop out to move the movie along. However the final scenes are amazing to behold and you feel the true terror of walking on a high wire. Without spoiling it one thing I will say is something is shown so that the audience believes it to be a big deal, only for it not to impact anything in the end."
" An absolutely amazing central sequence, and...the rest of the movie
",0.624,0.9965,2019-11-27 00:00:00,7,"There's one reason Robert Zemeckis wanted to make this film, and it's not the first ninety minutes. Those first ninety minutes are good, solid storytelling, but it wasn't Philippe Petit's quest to become a tight rope walker that attracted the director to the material, it was the eponymous trek from one World Trade Center building to the other by the rooves over a wire.Petit is a dreamer in the purest sense. He speaks to us throughout the entire movie in voiceover, given from the torch of the Statue of Liberty with 1970s era New York in the background, and he's full of vigor for his art. He tells us of his first exposure to high wire stunts when he snuck into a circus, how he started on his own, and eventually worked under the tutelage of Papa Rudy. He learns everything he can and develops his obsession with walking on the high wire between the soon to be completed twin towers.With the skill, knowhow, and drive to do it, Petit collects a series of co-conspirators in what he calls his ""coup"". One of the smaller things that runs through the film is Petit's purely apolitical viewpoint of his coup. He either gains support or antagonism from other characters based at least partially on their interpretation of the act, and the interpretations are almost always political. However, to Petit, it's only ever about the art and the act. He wants to do it, not to send any sort of message, but because he thinks it must be done.As implied earlier, this backstory is well told with a certain energy from the performers and editing. It's good, but the movie ups the ante when the coup begins to come together. The race to the top of the unfinished tower with all of the necessary equipment is solid thriller stuff. There's the ticking clock, sleeping guards, known unknowns just around the corner, and even an injury that's going to cause issues. It borders on the ridiculous at one point when Petit strips naked in an attempt to find the fishing wire that had been shot from the other tower.But, it's the walk itself that is the reason for this movie's existence, and it's magnificent. I watched it at home on a 2D screen and I was feeling vertigo to a slight degree at the dizzying heights. The reality of the experience is so well sold despite it being almost entirely CGI. The tension created from it is so thorough that the whole thing ends up as one of the great single special effects sequences of the last twenty years.The movie ends as a love letter to the towers themselves, saying that Petit's walk helped New York fall in love with them just as they were being completed. It's a nice comedown to such a great height of a filmmaking accomplishment.As a whole package, the movie it good, but that individual sequence is just so spectacular as that it could stand on its own as a short film."
" Told with heart
",0.0,0.9917,2019-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Based upon the real events of Phillipe Petit's tight rope walking betweem the Twin Towers, this is a beautifully told film of how Phillipe conceived, planned and executed the feat, or ""the coup"" as he called it. Even though, based upon the real events and therefore not any real room for surprises, the film has it's thrills and suspense. Also, the character Phillipe maintains that he is an artiste and that the coup is an artistic event. These values is incorporated into the movie. Phillipe, or rather Jospeh Gordon-Levitt in charachter as Phillipe, narrates the entire movie giving the story more depth and background, while also adding a subtle but warm humor. To enhance the story uses some CGI. This is beautifully done, sometimes subtle as when they play with the colours in Phillipe's reminiscence, or when the tightrope appears from thin air in Phillipe's mind. Other times it is evident, as in Philippe's walk between the two towers. In all, the makers of this movie uses the entire range of tools it has in terms of making a movie. From how the script is structured and the story told, to the use of special effects and CGI. I should also mention the cast, spearheaded by Gordon-Levitt. I think their acting is really good, giving heart and soul to the characters.All in all, this is a movie i recommend. It is surprising how they can fill this rather straight forward story with wrinkles and turns that make it both suspenseful and fun."
" The Walk is inspiring
",0.4215,0.9849,2019-08-22 00:00:00,8,"The walk is an drama thriller movie directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Kingsley, Charlotte Le Bon, James Badge Dale, Clément Sibony and César Domboy in important roles.The movie is based on the story of 24 year old French high-wire artist 'Philippe Petit' walk between the world trade centre on August 7, 1974.The movie is not only amazing but inspiring and credit should be given to Joseph Gordon-Levitt for his wonderful acting.The start of the movie is slow but it makes up as soon as it progresses. The acting of all the characters is good and so as the direction. Screenplay is good and background music supports the screenplay.An inspiring movie and true tribute to the world trade centre."
" Lame
",-0.4215,-0.6249,2019-08-02 00:00:00,3,"Worst directing I've seen in a long time.
And overacting all the way"
" High Wire Traction!
",0.0,0.9929,2019-07-01 00:00:00,8,"The Walk is a Robert Zemeckis film, so it almost goes without saying that visually and technically, it can hardly be faulted. Zemeckis has a pedigree almost as long as my arm, in creating films with outstanding visual and special effects. Here he dramatises the true story based on the memoir of the then 24-year-old French high-wire artist Philippe Petit whose walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on August 6th 1974, was featured in the 2008 Academy Award winning documentary Man on the Wire. To say the climax of the film, which recreates Petit's 45 minute walk between the towers in an abbreviated format of around 30 minutes is breathtaking, is to do it a disservice. It is stunning! The tension is palpable, with Zemeckis and lead cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, combining to give the viewer an unprecedented 360 degree perspective of what some came to label as ""the world's greatest artistic crime"".Speaking of crimes Zemeckis frames much of the movie's extended second act, similar to that of a caper/heist film, with the robbery being the vertigo-inducing towers sojourn. It works, with viewers being introduced, with numerous comic overtones, to the various members of what evolved into Petit's support crew for the walk, as well as his French-based mentor Papa Rudy, played by an excellent Ben Kingsley. What doesn't work so well in my opinion, is the kind of slow-paced first act. It gives us important background, but the pace is continually fragmented by too often cutting away to Petit, standing aloft on the Statue of Liberty, who subsequently breaks the fourth wall directly addressing viewers, as well as expounding his feelings on an endless range of topics.Unquestionably, the third act is reliant on Philippe's narration, enhancing the extraordinary visual journey he undertakes and on which viewers are his passengers. The final acknowledging hero shot of the sunset illuminated towers imagined from the Statue, is unforgettable too, but the flow of the establishing parts of the film is greatly hindered by these constant unnecessary talking head elaborations.Apart from this I find it quite astounding that Joseph Gordon-Levitt appears to have never really been recognised officially for his incredible performance as the mercurial, aerial daredevil. Supposedly fluent in French, he gives outstanding vocal and physical representations of the Frenchman, who later became a US citizen I understand. In my estimation, it's clearly his most memorable role, up to this time of writing.Perhaps not unsurprisingly, The Walk, whilst a critical success, never achieved a great deal commercially. I wonder whether it might be, that it is technically too good in the third act. That people who suffer from acrophobia, which seems to be a pretty common occurrence, were really intimidated by being asked to cinematically witness Petit's recreated ""coup""(as he calls it), not just on the big screen, but in 3d and on giant Imax screens. I have to admit, I've seen The Walk twice now and that a HD television screen will more than suffice my visual needs."
" Fantastic, interesting movie
",0.743,0.9978,2019-03-27 00:00:00,10,"One topic that seems to fascinate Hollywood and moviegoers alike is that of interesting, quirky people that doing interesting, quirky things. The Walk is one of such movies, and tells the story of Philippe Petit, who is famous for doing a tightrope walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in 1973. This remarkable event has been the subject of several documentaries, including the universally praised Man on Wire, but has never been dramatized. It's a biopic on Philippe, which starts with him being fascinated by tightrope walkers as a child in France and getting better and better at it. He learns that two buildings over 1,300 feet were built in New York and sets out to make crossing them on a wire his goal.Much of the film follows his quest in New York to create a wire sturdy enough to walk across at that height, and how he and his friends managed to sneak up to the 110th floor of each tower to get the wire across. To that extent, it's as much about the effort to get up there and hang the wire across as it is about the walk. It's a biopic, so it focuses on Philippe and the people around him, his friends and those who helped him get the wire up. That being said, it spends much more time on how he got there than what he did when he made it. That in itself is interesting, and the payoff with the walk itself is worth it.Joseph Gordon Levitt does a fantastic job at portraying Philippe. He looks like him, acts like him, and actually does a pretty good job at the accent. But most of all he shows the real Philippe's love of the tightrope so well, that we can't help but love this character and root for him every step of the way. The other characters include Annie, a fellow street performer who accompanies him to New York, Jean-Louis and Jeff, who help Philippe figure out how to configure the wire, and other people they meet along the way. The cinematography is great, especially during the walk itself. It juxtaposes the obvious peril with Beethoven's Fur Elise, creating a sense of both tension and calm. It's like Apollo 13; you know he lives, but when you're watching this you're still not completely sure about it.One thing that this movie addresses well is the fact that the World Trade Center is irrevocably tied to 9/11. Everyone sees those towers and immediately thinks of the attacks, and all of the memories and emotions that come with them. The ending pays its respects but doesn't go overboard. It's handled very well."
" Enjoying My Time
",0.5267,0.824,2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"Not waste of a time. I enjoyed watching the journey of Philippe from the city of Paris to the city of New York, from discovering his dream to fulfilling his dream."
" deviate from realism
",0.0,-0.8985,2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"The pavement in front is a little long, but the terrible height of the building is too small, the primary and secondary is not clear enough. On the steel wire of the building, walking back and forth several times, deducing directly and abstractly, I feel that there is a lack of real dilemma, such as high-altitude wind speed, etc., and also deviate from realism."
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.9753,2019-02-02 00:00:00,7,"The Walk was quite a decent film, it felt a little long sometimes but delivered in the end. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a good job and brings Philippe Petit to life. The latter part of the film was probably its strongest and best, showing the build up and finally the climb.Improvements could have been in the first half and making it with more flair. The CGI, recreation of the towers and the walk itself was beautifully done. While this film is a tribute to Philippe it is also in so many ways a tribute to the twin towers. This enhances the film, it remembered the majestic towers that once rose to the heavens. Even the the final scene focuses on the towers and captures a different moment in time. 7/10"
" Unexpected enjoyable
",0.4404,0.9231,2019-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Had my doubts to watch, but when it started I was pleasantly surprised - good cast and a message: pursue your dreams"
" I prefer the 2008 documentary Man on Wire
",0.0,-0.6187,2018-12-28 00:00:00,5,"As strange as it sounds, I don't think Joseph Gordon-Levitt was the right choice to play Philippe Pettit. A movie's anchor is its lead character, and I had a hard time seeing this lead as anything else but JGL doing a silly French accent, and The Walk suffered because of it. While this movie did make my palms sweat at times, in the end I would rather watch the 2008 documentary Man on Wire to get the story of Mr. Pettit."
" Best Film of Its Kind - The Walk
",0.8225,-0.0525,2018-12-23 00:00:00,8,"This film is not for those with a fear of heights. You must really see it to feel the sensation of height. How tragic the towers are no longer there. I used to work in them, and then I used to sell collectibles on the street just a few blocks away. New York lost a piece of its soul when the towers went down. The movie, directed by pro Zemenkis, is beautifully photographed, staged, and paced. There is never a dull moment from Paris to New York. Originally, I did not think a film could hold an audience for an hour and a half based on this stunt, but Zemenkis pulled it off with style. Highly (guffaw) recommended."
" So good
",0.4927,0.4404,2018-10-27 00:00:00,8,This movie was way better than I expected it to be
" Great visual experience but only decent movie
",0.3716,-0.9167,2018-10-15 00:00:00,7,"I'll start with the positive aspects that in my view are distinct in this movie and make it worth watching:visually, it is perfectly done. The wire scenes are really not recommended for someone who suffers from vertigo because they leave you (much like the real man was) on the edge. And this is thanks to masterfully selected shots / angles and editing. Makes me wish I had seen this in the movies. Along with some clever scene transition throughout the movie, 10/10 in the visual delivery of the story.unlike most protagonist focused movies (real or fiction), they really make a good case that no one can't accomplished much on their own. The interaction and need for companions (or accomplices as Philip puts it) in his coup is actually fairly refreshing if you compare this movie with others of the same natureJG Levitt's performance is convincing. I must admit was turned off in the first few minutes by his made up French accent but he portrays quite well the real man's ambition, drive, faults and obsession that the real wire walker had. So well done to the actorOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I would say there are several aspects of this movie that made me give it only a 7 (7.5 perhaps would be fairer)the need to cut away to a different scene to have the main protagonist narrating the story as it proceeds. To be honest, this comes across to me as one of two things - lazy writing or need to make the movie easily understandable for even the most distracted of viewers. Ultimately, it feels dumbed down to have constantly the story interrupted to cutaways of the same protagonist explaining what's going on. The beauty of movies should be to leave the audience to interpret it. And the story follows a very rational sequence in any case so... There should be no need for thisless important but also a bit of a turn off for me, is that it follows in the trap of introducing the cliche "" hero does something bad to sidekicks and then later on redeems itself"" into the story towards the end, which how ever true it may be, is not actually of value add to the movie. The movie is about the man's obsession. And it would actually make it more raw and brutal if no redemption take place, given the ending (will say no more to avoid spoilers)"
" Brave and scary
",0.0516,0.765,2018-09-24 00:00:00,7,"Amazing story about brave French high-wire Philippe Petit. The only problem for me was that walk because I am scared of heights so I couldn't watch that part. If you are agrofobic,I recommend you to not watch that part.
If you like this movie then you should really check documentary about this event- Man on Wire.
P.S. Joseph Gordon-Levitt can speak french."

In fact, I should be referring to it as a Film, because it was a Film, not a regular hum-drum movie. I will try not to give too much plot away. Since 2011, I have not heard or seen coverage of the World Trade Center (WTC) without it being all about the Terror Attacks that brought them down. This film made that change. This film showed how someone admired, worshipped and lived the WTC as they were being built, and set a lifetime ambition onto them. It made the WTC beautiful again, as seen by the first viewers, as almost virginal for the world to see in a new light. This film had so much feeling and heart, so much reality and realism that it took my breath away, brought me to the floor with primal emotions that I was afraid to face at first. It made my eyes tear, my skin gooseflesh, my muscles tighten. I was taken from relaxed, to edge of my seat, to biting my pillow. It was a being in and of itself, taking me with it on it's journey. I was completely spellbound."
" Incroyable!
",0.0,0.9742,2018-07-05 00:00:00,9,"The movie is superb. Joseph did a spectacular job in it his look and his accent in French and English as the French spoke it , He really should have been nominated for a serious award as the globes or maybe even the Oscars. The movie is very underrated , the music and editing are superb only Zemeckis had some scenes that you felt the effect added on it and was just dull as most of the movies in the end of the year. The visual effects was average but it didn't have to be perfect cause it could present the idea and make you feel the intense and excited and on the edge of your seat with lots of sweats too . The movie too had the very quick rhythm that some less scenes when it took long to explain it you might feel bored but not for sure about that and also it's style was unique in it's preview and also the movie didn't make fun of the audience's smart and criticism which I very respect but it was too quick that you feel they might hide something wrong and you couldn't notice it and the ending scene which was amazing but went a little bit awesome exaggerated! By far one of Joseph's best performances and one of my favourite movies. 8.5/10"
" Interesting movie
",0.4019,0.9442,2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,The Walk was an inspirational story about a man from France who has put on many circus type acts in France for tightrope walking and comes to America in New York City to expand his talent by elaborating a scheme with his friends to hook various cables across the world trade center buildings for his biggest stunt yet. This involves walking while holding a giant stick. This is a true story from 1974. I liked it.
" ALL ARTISTS ARE ANARCHISTS

We know the climax ending before it starts. The film flashes back to Paris and his childhood as we get glimpses of his training and the people who help him along. I didn't see it in 3D and I was a bit underwhelmed. The tightrope at Notre Dame seemed rather fake, looking like he was walking on a floor.Yes a French guy with some help, walked across the WTC."
" A film of two halves!

Then the event starts to take place and it had to be one of the intense viewings ever! Completely nail-biting and thrilling I now need to watch the documentary if this event.
" The Walk balances heightening visuals with a towering aspirational story.
",0.0,0.9934,2018-04-11 00:00:00,7,"The true story of a man, just one individual, walking across the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Yes, Philippe Petit had the audacity to disobey the law and chase his dream, thus consequently creating an inspirational life story that I'm sure will reinvigorate many. The Walk, obviously depicting the grandeur of the stunt, also dabbles into his backstory and how he found his passion for being an artist. An underlying theme throughout the plot, Petit wasn't just an entertainer, he viewed his displays with a sense of artistry. Exuberantly confident yet fiercely determined, Zemeckis once again has produced a whimsical tale that ensures you experience an array of emotions. Gordon-Levitt's performance of the central character was phenomenal. A perfect French accent to accompany his commitment to the act of high-wire walking, he became truly captivating. The supporting cast were good with Kingsley being the most noticeable. The vital aspect to the film is the visual grandeur which increasingly induces acrophobia as the stunts become more death-defying. Zemeckis puts this at the forefront, particularly during the twin tower walk, where the breath-taking heights feel both nauseating and illustrious. I can only imagine how enthralling the 3D would've been, I may have to give it a watch next time. The story was well paced and mostly focussed on the infiltration of the World Trade Center which felt reminiscent to classic Chaplin films. An endearing tone of clumsiness entered the narrative, especially when the plan stumbles occasionally. The main problem, which surprised me given Zemeckis at the helm, was how heavy-handed the narrative was conveyed. The over reliance of narration and the fact it took a biographical route (as the film is told through a flashback), meant that there were no thrills. Any issues that occurred during the stunt automatically negated any excitement, because we all know how the film ends due to the narrative structure. Ultimately, a disappointing aspect to what is a high flying biopic."

The way Petit tries to recruit ""accomplices"" is utterly adorable: Like he's trying to recruit schoolmates to participate in an imaginary society at recess.To create a film about a singular event that's shorter than the runnning time of the movie comes with its own unique set of challenges and Robert Zemeckis handles them admirably well.Based on the 1974 stunt of Frenchman Philippe Petit's high wire act between the Twin Towers, the film provides an excuse for Robert Zemmeckis to do what he does best: Experiment with special effects while delivering reliable middle-brow narrative.

It's a bit stereotypical but I'll let it slide for two reasons: it's in keeping with the fantasical tone of the film and for all I know that's what Petit sounded like.The film has a little bit of a heist film with the ""Ocean's 11"" structure of revealing much of it beforehand with a blurring of past and present.It's a film that's all about a singular event which has the positive effect of increased tension leading up to the fact. If the film grabs you and the protagonist hasn't even started his high-wire walk, you know that the walk will really work.As for the walk itself? It's mostly about the gorgeous photography and score which unfortunately drowned out the human element for me, but it was plenty tense. I had the benefit of not knowing specifically what would happen or how long he was up there and I desperately wanted to shout ""For god's sakes, get off the wire!"" It helps if you don't specifically know all the details so you can let the story entice you."
" A masterpiece of film-making
",0.6249,0.9971,2018-03-12 00:00:00,10,"This was simply one of the very best films I have seen in years. Firstly, the camera work/special effects work is (literally) breath-taking. I only saw the film in ordinary TV mode when the film was tucked away in the afternoon schedule of a movie channel. Even so, many scenes (and particularly, of course, the final section of the film dealing with The Walk itself) have your palms sweating, your heart racing, the hairs on the back of your neck standing up etc. etc. all at once! I was not aware the film was made in 3D until I read the pages here, but seeing it in that format (or IMAX or even just on a big screen) must have been a truly awesome experience! Secondly, the direction is masterful and easily on a par with Hitchcock at his very best. Not a minute is wasted and you are dragged along from one scene to the next with the speed of an express train! This MUST be a ""textbook film"" for aspiring film makers/tutors in film academies? Thirdly, the acting in the main roles is very good. Ben Kingsley puts in a fine performance as the mentor/trainer/sponsor/father figure and the other leading characters are also very well played. Every award going, however, should have been given to the lead actor who displays a stunning mixture of humour, affection, endearment, fanaticism/madness, scheming and humanity which is absorbing and likewise helps you desperately wanting to know what happens next. Fourthly, and what makes this a truly great film, is what is NOT said. Form the very first, stunning shot of the Twin Towers you know precisely what happened to them on that fateful day in 2001 and yet the ONLY direct reference (and that in an ""indirect"" way!) to those events is made by the lead player in signing off at the very end and literally in the very last words spoken in the film and before the credits roll. These words had me on the verge of tears and made it clear that the real ""message"" of this film is not just about some guy walking between two high buildings but is really about what it is to be a human being; to pursue dreams, to aim at the impossible, to live life to the (very) fullest, to (as Nietzsche said) ""live dangerously"", even if it means standing (way) out from the crowd and being fully prepared to be asked ""Why?"" so many times, you lose count. What the film seems to me to be pointing out is how the events of 2001 were brought about by people motivated by the complete opposite: the desperate desire to die/annihilate themselves and to deny life to thousands of other people at the same time, to ""close down"" human desires for individualism and to work in favour of a monolithic, dead, uniform/totally conformist society in which NO challenging of set rules whatsoever by anyone is to be allowed. For these reasons (and as opposed to most of the films I have seen which explicitly address the events at Ground Zero and which, while obviously well-intentioned and sincere, have seemed leaden and 'flat' to me), I would choose this film as THE tribute to those who lost their lives in that appalling event, together with those who grieved and still grieve them. Film-making as pure art and enormously entertaining at the same time!"
" This movie really got to me.
",0.0,0.7902,2018-02-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie really moved me as I can't stand heights and my heart rate went up hugely as I watched the walk as it was so realistic. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who speaks French fluently, was very good. The direction and cinematography were brilliant."
" Thrilling, Entertaining and Ultimately Quite Moving
",0.7184,0.9978,2018-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie! I watched it last night (alas, on the small screen) and came in to work this morning recommending it to all my co-workers.The Walk recounts the remarkable true story of Philippe Petit's no-less-than-legendary tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center in 1974.I was just a teenager when this remarkable exploit took place, literally above the heads of early-morning Downtown office workers, and only vaguely remember the way it happened, but watching this movie brought to the fore the background story of how Petit first became enamored of the Twin Towers and the immense planning that went into this stunt. I would imagine that few who know of Petit realize that he had quite a retinue working behind the scenes with him, so this movie is their story as well. Being a New Yorker (and one who works Downtown, no less), what I found so amazing in the retelling of this tale was the nonchalant way that Petit and his cohorts, during both the planning and execution of this feat, managed to access the upper deck of the World Trade Center virtually unchallenged while it was still in the very midst of being constructed! Anyone who works Downtown today (in the sad aftermath of 9/11) will marvel at how lax security was in those innocent times. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fabulous job in this role. He is so charming and so engaging as the goal-oriented, indeed obsessed, but always good-natured Petit. You cannot help but get swirled up in his enthusiasm for his plan, which he and his accomplices have dubbed ""The Coup"" for the extraordinary headline-grabbing event that it turned out to be. One of the things I loved most about this movie, in addition to the infectious élan of the protagonist, were the scenes of New York from 1974. Generally speaking, I do NOT care for special effects, but the CGI here was extremely authentic in the way it reconstructed New York from 40+ years ago. Considering how different this ever-changing city looked all those years ago, the effects were very realistic to the time. The scenes from the top of the WTC showing the streets below were nothing short of awesome and again, very realistic. Knowing Downtown as I do I was able to pick out many individual landmarks with which I am so familiar. I also loved the scenes - again, computer-generated - where Petit is narrating his story from the torch of the Statue of Liberty, with the 1974 outline of Downtown in the background, an outline which in reality is very different today since the advent of Battery Park City and World Financial Center (which were in fact built on landfill from the excavation of the WTC). This is my long-winded way of pointing out that someone did his homework in the making of this movie, and this New Yorker is thoroughly impressed with the finely detailed results! This movie was downright thrilling! It was extremely suspenseful, to a point toward the end where I was watching it curled up in a tense little ball and peeking through my fingers - even though I knew it was going to end on a triumphant note - as Petit performs his death-defying (and police-defying, LOL) antics on the tightrope he has so painstakingly rigged. Speaking of the ending, that was what I truly loved most about this movie. What I found so touching was the way the movie came across ultimately as a paean or love story to our beloved Twin Towers. It brought tears to my eyes.In conclusion, a very entertaining movie. (Perhaps a tad too long, but still wonderful.) I only wish I had got to see it on the big screen where it deserves to be seen. It takes almost a suspension of belief to grasp that the central event of this movie really took place. But it did. Only in New York....."
" The almost total return of a great filmmaker
",0.6249,0.9903,2018-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Before I start, I will say that for me, Robert Zemeckis can be one of the great film directors of recent times. Although lately and for my pleasure I stumbled, with a movie, which I will not say, in case someone has not seen it. I think he has returned and in a big way.The film has clear flaws, one of them is the hairdressing and makeup of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, it is horrible and does not look like Philippe Petit. Another is that for me, the film may lack a bit of tension. But what is clear is that no one manages the camera to narrate like this director.
The photography is great. It gets you into the story.The actors are leading you to follow the story.Obviously it has a lot of 3d, but it is so well done, it seems that you are there.
Plane to plane, they are all designed to count beautifully and also use an incredible depth of field. You do not need to make several plans to tell one thing, in a single plane it tells you, with a great staging and not because of it is boring, on the contrary you do not get bored, although I repeat, a little tension is missing.It is pure entertainment cinema, yes, but what entertainment, it does entertain and not like others that only bore and in which nothing is understood by the speed of its assembly. The truth is that I enjoy its almost two hours, like a child.
This is the director of the trilogy of Return to the future, which rejoiced my youth and the rest of my life and has returned to make us feel vertigo from the heavens.Spoiler:In the last part of the film, when everything happens in the cable, nobody would have that vision to put the camera at the height of a cable when it is going to break a piece"

Then...I remember walking out of the theater with shaking legs and cold palms! My friend showed me her sweaty palms. During the show, my feet curled up, and i believed my balls shrink! This is the best experience i ever got from watching a movie! Movie makers should make more of these, so to discourage netizens from just downloading it. When bluray became available, i purchased the 3D versions. I tried to relive the moment, however the vertigo experience just wasn't there.

" An Excellent Film with a Career-Best Performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt!
",0.6114,0.9962,2017-09-24 00:00:00,9,"Fear of heights, anyone? I sure do. So watching 'The Walk' was a challenge for me of sorts. I mean, I know its all happening on the screen, but the vibe & the atmosphere is sure to make my heartbeat really fast. And oh boy, it did! And what also 'The Walk' did was deliver some solid entertainment in those 2 hours.'The Walk' Synopsis: In 1974, high-wire artist Philippe Petit recruits a team of people to help him realize his dream: to walk the immense void between the World Trade Center towers.Philippe Petit accomplished the near impossible & left the world startled. And his journey is brought on the screen with an excellent film. Legendary Oscar-Winning Director Robert Zemeckis directs 'The Walk' superbly. This biographical drama is consistently engaging & even though THE WALK doesn't happen until 90-minutes into the film, you're still engaged & never impatient to see the big moment. Zemeckis & Christopher Browne's Screenplay, which is based on book To Reach the Clouds by Philippe Petit himself, is arresting & nicely builds the story before the main big moment happens. And I must say, the entire sequence involving THE WALK, will take your breath away. Its something you need to experience. And now coming to the champ of 'The Walk' - Joseph Gordon-Levitt!. JGL is simply terrific as Philippe Petit. Right from a flawless french accent to his anxious body-language, JGL is a marvel. This is a career-best performance from an actor, who deserves so much more! Also in good form are Charlotte Le Bon as Petit's supportive girlfriend, James Badge Dale as one of Petit's team members & Sir Ben Kingsley as Petit's father figure, who teaches him the essence of life & art. On the whole, 'The Walk' is a must watch. Strongly Recommended!"
" Joseph Gordon-Levitt ruined it for me
",-0.4767,-0.3384,2017-09-22 00:00:00,1,"All of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's focus in this movie was on, see how French how look, how French I talk, he overacted trying to act French and I'm 45 min into the movie and I can't take it anymore, he is plain pathetic and I'm only reviewing it in hopes that American casting directors will stop making these kind casting jokes. I know a lot of people liked it, it's a compelling story. Direction is also weak, there's literally no character build up, maybe that's why Joseph Gordon-Levitt looked even more irritating and mostly everybody in this movie, you really don't know who they are besides their names etc. There are only 2 or 3 movies ever which I've left in the middle and this is one of them."
" One Small Step For Man.
",0.0,0.9912,2017-08-29 00:00:00,6,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Phillipe Petit, the young man from France who walked across a wire between the twin towers of the World Trade Center when construction was almost finished in the early 1970s. Not only did he walk across, he walked across the yawning chasm four times. Well, 3.8 times. And he survived to become a celebrity for a period and earn a place in the book of world records.It's far from a stark drama. It's more of a caper movie along the lines of ""Never on Sunday"", a salubrious blend of comedy, irony, and suspense, a realization of one man's fantasy. Petit relates his tale directly into the camera from the torch atop the Statue of Liberty. He makes no jokes but he's amusing because he demonstrates his exasperation when something goes awry and he does it the way a child might do it. Quelle nuisance! What eece that veesitor doing op here at theece hour of the morning! The police officers who occupy the roofs of both towers while Petit is in the middle are equally amusing: ""We got a couple of Frogs up here."" I can understand how Petit could walk the wire between the two towers. He's good at it. It's much harder to understand how he managed to organize and pull off this stunt (""the coup"") and how he managed to recruit his handful of assistants and supporters (""accomplices""). They're a varied lot, these accomplices. Half are French and half are American. Petit meets one of them for the first time in Paris, Jeff, an aspiring photographer and artist, who doesn't believe in the sanctity of art or the privileged position of the artist. ""Hah, so you're an anarchist!"" ""Every artist is an anarchist to some extent."" (That's the kind of conversational exchange you're far more likely to hear in Paris than in Dubuque.) I've been using the word ""suspense"" a little freely. ""Tension"" might be more apt. After all, we already know Petit pulled it off and lived to tell the tale. The guy is admirable, even though his obsession made him difficult to work with. And I suppose many artists want to do some Big Thing, some memorable (even if ephemeral) work of art. Gutson Borglum must have been flooded with self satisfaction when he finished the faces on Mount Rushmore. In the mid-1970s Christo built a fabric wall 25 miles long through Sonoma and Marin Counties in the San Francisco Bay area. About the same time someone tried to mount a huge rubber balloon of King Kong on top of the Empire State building but unlike Phillipe Petit, King Kong fell. Petit had the better central pattern generator."

" Jules Dassin style heist picture, but for outlaw tightrope walking
",0.0,0.9799,2017-07-19 00:00:00,7,"First off, I watched this in 2-D on a TV at home and I imagine this film was a much different of experience in IMAX 3-D. I saw a preview of this film in 3D on the big screen when I watched ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and that two or three minutes was the best use of 3-D I'd ever seen. The story follows tight-rope walker Philippe Petit in 1974 planning to conduct an illegal tight walk rope between the newly constructed twin towers in NYC. The first half of the film was fairly mundane backstory material, but once Petit, played by the terrific Joseph Gordon-Levitt, begins to assembly his team and hatches a plan how he'll pull off this stunt, the movie becomes a 1960s Jules Dassin jewel heist film in the best sort of way. To compliment the Dassin vibe, there's a jazzy 1960s style score by Alan Silvestri, a colorful and quirky team, fun trial and error planning sequences, and all sorts of conning and dodging to infiltrate the building, which is amazingly fun. Then there's the eventual tightrope walk between the towers and even watching it on a TV was a dizzying and suspenseful experience. I can only imagine what this must have been like in IMAX 3-D. My main complaints about the film are the dull first act, which seemed like filler, and the film's over use of voice-over, which seemed a lazy way to deliver exposition. Still, director Robert Zemeckis delivers a knockout of a film and Gordon-Levitt continues to show himself as one of the best actors currently working today."
" Not for acrophobiacs
",0.0,0.9865,2017-07-10 00:00:00,9,"This is a splendid film in all respects. The acting has a highly effective subdued quality. There is much creative photography, for example some of the early shots of Petit riding his bicycle that have colour highlighted on a black and white scene. There is comedy, drama, suspense and interestingly drawn characters. It captures the essence of both Paris and New York. Of course the scenes from the top of the World Trade Centre are spectacularly good. I was amazed to read here that it was shot in Imax 3D. I'm thankful I didn't see it that way because even on my flat screen TV, the shots from the top of the tower were so gut wrenching that I had to turn away. (I'm a bit of an acrophobiac myself.) I was disappointed that there were no details on the IMDb on how the World Trade Centre was recreated so impressively. This was shot 14 years after it was destroyed on 9/11.Also curious how they put Petit at the very top of the Statue of Liberty for his narration. It must have been a set but it was hugely effective. There also must have been a great deal of computer generated effects. A really impressive film!"

It's worth to watch this once time."

And by ""decent"" don't you think even for a second I mean no action, tension and whatever else prevent a movie to be boring. This one has it all! The movie presents the real story of Phillipe Petit, that Petit that had the insane courage to cross the Twin Towers from NY on a wire. Is a biographical movie starting from the youth of Petit until the moment of crossing the towers. And it does that almost flawlessly. What I liked most was the burlesque air of the film, especially in the ""French"" part of it.Joseph Gordon-Levitt simply shines in this movie! You would swear he is born in France, speaking French perfectly and having such a natural French accent when speaking English. Going further, the entire band of lunatics that helped Petit to achieve his dream is portrayed so good, so colorful and with a very refined humor. Good casting! And so we get to the last part of the movie, where I find myself forgetting to breathe. The image is so spectacular that it cannot be described. You have to watch this movie and don't be surprised to feel a little dizzy, especially on the 3D version of the movie. Chapeau! Watch it. It worth the money and the time. It's not the best movie ever made but, from my part, it deserves a place on the shortlist of very good movies."

",-0.4926,0.995,2017-05-30 00:00:00,7,"After watching this Acrophobia filled experience. I was left with my heart palpitating and my back was soaked from sweat. I wanted to turn away from the large screen but instead I amerced myself focused on our daredevil walker who kept on tormenting my senses. Over my many years of watching the cinema I've had a passion to watch alarming,unnerving, filled with shock value movies. I can't answer why I watch these films but I keep on searching for more of that genre which will probably keep me up for the rest of the night with covers over my head. This eager Frenchman who is about to attempt a coup as he calls it . Gathering his cast of characters to attempt the high wire walk between the World Trade Center towers. I was totally impressed with the work of our star Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Phillippe Petit. Now much older Joseph who I remember as the boy in the hit TV show Third Rock plays the part flawlessly with ease as the jaunty Frenchman who's goal is to walk some 200' across the twin towers buy August 1974. From working in a circus in Europe as a boy under the tutelage of his Father Papa Rudy played by the very distinguished Academy Award winning actor Ben Kingsley, Papa teaches young Phillipe how to tie knots and rope rigging which will comes in handy for his most outrageous profession. As the movie progresses as told by Phillippe as our narrator he meets his girl friend also a street performer Annie played by Charlotte Le Bon. Love the reality of a typical couple in New York always fighting as the goal of the walk get ever so close. Bumps in the road are the norm as accomplice after accomplice gather in one goal. Phillippe our pesky rope walker fills his obsession from that faithful day in the Dentist's chair when his vision/epiphany of walking across the twin towers was born. Other participants involved,Clement Sibony as Jean Louis, Cesar Domboy as Jeff. Ben Schwartz as Albert and Steve Valentine as Barry Greenhouse. I was overwhelmingly impressed with the cinematography mainly the visual effects as if you, the viewer where up on that rope some thousand feet in the air. The use of the clouds floating by at the beginning of the walk as you say to your self that's not so bad, and then a clearing of the city below with a crowd of ants, People watching up word in horror. Extremely sobering experience. My personal nature is to expedite a project and be done with it but not in this movie which frustrated me as our lovable flying Frenchman milks the opportunity for all the world to see.Bravo to Danusz Wolski for his direction of photography and to the hundreds of employees in the visual effects department. One thing I'll always remember is that Petit never walked alone. You the audience walked right alone with him."
" Philippe Petit rarely put a foot wrong and the same can be said for this film
",0.3724,0.9973,2017-05-06 00:00:00,8,"1974; French high-wire artist Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) decides to take his trade to the next level when he spots an article in a magazine which shows a picture of two of the tallest towers in the world (namely the world trade centre or twin towers)being built in close proximity to one another. Petit has a dream of wire-walking between the two towers and heads to New York to pursue his dream. Along the way, he recruits a crack team of assistants known as the coup and the team work together to help Philippe realise his dream before he gets caught by the authorities.This film caught my interest when I was scrolling through Sky Cinema; it's a biopic but it's one about a wire-walker which is something a little bit different and for that reason I decided to give it a go...In atypical biopic fashion, the film starts off in France focusing on Petit's early life and Zemeckis does a good job in exploring Petit's character and his various struggles in achieving his dream, but it's all done in a light-hearted and fun way. Zemeckis' approach is also very measured here and he manages to develop the characters and the story sufficiently, but not at the expense of the film becoming drawn-out or boring at any point (then again I would expect nothing less as the man has directed some excellent films so clearly this is all down to experience).Zemeckis does a solid job throughout the film, but it's the second half where things really begin to pick up. Zemeckis clearly liked the idea of Petit having a 'coup' and their preparation in getting everything up to the top of the towers has a very 'Mission Impossible' style vibe to it. This isn't a criticism by the way because the 'Mission Impossible' style antics make the film a lot of fun to watch and there are also some tense moments along the way too. It seems that Zemeckis has employed some poetic licence here and I'm sure that the character of Annie (Petit's girlfriend) is fictitious - she isn't mentioned anywhere on Petit's wiki page in any event. Her inclusion in the film isn't a problem as she is very much a side character; had she been more prominent in the film or had Zemeckis created loads of unnecessary melodrama and mush between the pair then I probably would have been angry, but he doesn't so this comment is more of an observation than anything else.Of course, the real reason for watching this film is to see the inevitable 'walk between the two towers' and I, for one, found it breath-taking. I mean I realise it's not real and that special effects of some kind have been employed, but for someone like me who is terrified of heights it still made me nervous watching it. It's rare that I'm so nervous and so on the edge of my seat when watching a film, but this one really got me hooked in and this was due to a combination of good special-effects and Zemeckis' ability to crank up the suspense.One thing that I did think was quite brave on Zemeckis part was the fourth wall style narrative that Joseph Gordon-Levitt provides in order to drive the film forward. Yes it's a little bit cheesy and isn't entirely necessary, but it's not something that I had a real problem with to be honest.When all is said and done there's very little wrong with this film; the acting is good, the film is well-paced, the cinematography and special-effects are excellent and the story is very well-constructed and presented and the finale is excellent. In short, this is worth seeing."

One can easily tell the care that was put in to the entire experience. The problem? Will enough people care and identify with the story to make it a classic?For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the true-life story of Phillippe Petit (Joseph Gordon- Levitt), whose life-long dream is to suspend a wire between the World Trade Center towers in NYC and walk across it. Coached by mentor Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) and supported by girlfriend Annie (Charlotte Le Bon), Phillippe leaves his French home and comes to America to begin preparations (which obviously must be done in stealth, as such a crazy stunt is quite illegal). He rounds up a team of associates and puts the plan into motion. Will he succeed in his life's passion? That will only be determined by the luck of the plan coming together (at long odds) and his mastery of the wire.I'll start with the good things about this film:-As mentioned, Zemeckis is a wonderful director. He could take drying paint and create some sort of narrative around it, if need be. -Levitt continues to shine as an actor, falling effortlessly into the charisma needed for the protagonist to be interesting enough to care about at all. His energy provides the emotional and adventurous fuel to the experience. -The visuals are impressive. I didn't see the film in 3-D, but even in 2-D the images (especially towards the end when the drama is heightened to its utmost) popped out at me.Here's the reason (well, reasons, I guess) why I can only give this film 3 out of five stars:-I wasn't alive when it happened. -I have no ties to New York City. -I haven't watched the documentary about the event. -I really don't have any appreciation for or knowledge of the subversive art community.Basically, I went into the film a completely blank slate (no expectations one way or another). As a result, upon the conclusion of the viewing experience, the answer to the questions ""why do I care about this"" or ""is this worthy of a big-screen adaptation"" came up lacking. While the high- wire feat itself was the draw for me (and those scenes paid off beautifully), the bulk of the movie (the build-up) failed to strike too many chords with me. Simply put, either the movie didn't do quite enough to suck me in and make me care, or I don't have the right set of background experiences to make that happen. Either way, that's the reason why I can't proclaim this one from the rooftops or anything like that.So, while ""The Walk"" was another tightly-directed Zemeckis drama, I felt (at least in my case) it was a bit too ""niche"" for me to truly appreciate its nuances. Perhaps enough others will appreciate them and this movie will be a success...perhaps not, and it will be more of a cult hit. Only time will tell."
" Man on Wire
",0.0,0.9704,2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"I'm a huge fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt as well as James Marshes 2008 Oscar winning documentary ""Man on Wire"" from which this film adaption is based on, so I was excited for this movie when I first heard about it. The final product does not disappoint. Many people have complained about JGLs French accent but he actually nails it and depicts the films protagonist Philip Petit perfectly. The real star of the film however is the amazing special effects and how well the World Trade Center is brought to life--it's almost bittersweet. The film is a true story of a high-wire walker who illegally broke into the two towers in 1974 and walked across them both on only a tight rope with no harness. The final 8 minute sequence of the act itself is worth the ticket price alone and is absolutely mesmerizing. Be warned that this is not for the squeamish for anyone with a fear of heights! For this reason, I avoided seeing the movie in 3D. The pacing is slow at times but overall the sorry is a remarkable one and the way it is shot is beautiful."
