" Slow, Then Flat, Then Dissspointing.
",0.0,-0.0331,2020-07-25 00:00:00,5,"I had really enjoyed 2 other of Mungius movies, so I was really looking forward to watching Graduation. It seem to possess much of the same natural feeling as the other films, and their minimalism, which I had liked; so I couldn't understand why I was not enjoying it as much. It plodded quite slowly in the beginning, and then just at the point where the tension ratcheted up, and things seemed to get more interesting, it then fell flat, and ended in a way that made me feel dissapointed. To be sure the narrative is layered, and revealing of Romanians corrupt society, but wasn't all that compelling, I found. Nor very entertaining."
" Romanian actors have no consideration for the region's accent
",-0.296,-0.8479,2020-02-01 00:00:00,1,"This movie shows the contempt that actors from Bucharest show towards the rest of the country, and for the variety of accents displayed in the regions, always choosing to correct their speech with ""the right way of talking"".
The story takes place in Cluj, a City in the region of Transilvania (Ardeal), well known for it's distinct accent, yet even the grandmother seems to be deprived of it.This is the problem with most romanian movies, which is what makes them feel inauthentic, and very hard for most of us to watch."
" Good actors, good directing, but a too long and unfinished story. It's a no for me.
",0.0258,0.9465,2019-02-06 00:00:00,4,"I don't think I watched alot of Romanian movies before, or at least I don't remember them, so I was a little curious about this one since it got good rates and reviews. The truth is that it's well directed, nothing bad to say about that, and it had good actors, unknown to me but nonetheless they were good. But the movie has some serious issues. First of all it's way too long for the story it is. You could have told that story in half the time. Second and most important thing to me is the extremely weak ending. I like stories with an ending that gives you closure, where you feel satisfied after watching a two hour movie, and that is absolutely not the case with this movie. Bacalaureat or Graduation is just too long and the promising story just turns out to be boring and unfinished."
" An incredible film! Go watch!
",0.0,0.4578,2018-09-30 00:00:00,9,"As a Romanian, I can attest that this film is a true depiction of corruption in Romania and Romania itself.
But even if you're not interested in the country, you will still find a well-acted, well-scripted touching story. Hugely recommend!"
" Between Hope and Despair
",0.1531,0.2144,2018-07-18 00:00:00,8,"The tense relationship and the difficult objective dilemma have been relatively positively resolved, so the end of the story seems to give the audience a sigh of relief. But from another perspective, the boundaries between morality and rules are increasingly blurred. The placement of each of the small events in the script is just right, but the overall look is still a bit of a clich√©.
The disillusionment of a generation and the reincarnation of the second generation appear to be somewhat cramped in this moral drama. Personally feel that the indifferent middle-aged dilemma has nothing to do with the times, and the depiction of this private state is precisely the best of the film."

" Does The End Justify The Means?
",0.0,0.8689,2018-04-07 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)This very common philosophy is hammered on in this film. By a father trying to find a path for his daughter out of their substandard life in Romania. If she gets excellent grades on her exams, she'll have a good opportunity for a better future. Just before her exams, she is physically assaulted, fending off a rape attempt, which threatens her opportunity. Will her father try to pull some strings to get her what he feels she deserves? Characterized as a moral doctor, while currently having an affair, he wrestles with the morality of what strings he wants to pull for his daughter, which in turn help to justify his personal life choices for his current station in life. While well-acted and for containing some serious dramatic situations, it seemed to lacked dramatic tension and an emotional connection to the characters. It was a good story with some nice plot points yet lacked memorable intrigue."
" Deeper life themes in fine film
",0.2023,-0.9045,2018-02-10 00:00:00,7,"In a small Romanian town, Romeo (Adrien Titeini) is a local doctor who is hell-bent on ensuring his teenage daughter Eliza (Maria-Victoria Dragus) excels in her final high-school exams in order to be accepted at a university in the U.K. He is even willing to cross legal and ethical boundaries to make this happen after Eliza faces a crisis shortly before her exams.Director/writer Christian Mungiu seems to have a knack for courageously exposing his home country's culture of corruption and the moral dilemmas this causes for average citizens - especially when these folks are in a quandary and ""taking the high road"" would not likely get them what they want and need. In ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days"", the story revolved around arranging an illegal abortion during the Communist era; in ""Graduation"" (which takes place in the current time), it involves Romeo's insistence that his only child must leave corrupt Romania in order to have a decent life and future.""Graduation"" begins quite well in introducing the audience to interesting characters and how they respond to the corruption in their midst. The middle part is even more intriguing as Romeo's moral compass goes so downhill that he is becoming what he once condemned. It is evident he's acted this way before but not at this level.There are two key scenes in this section in which Romeo defends his actions. One involves an argument with his wife; the other with Eliza. During the dispute with his wife (played by Lia Bugnar), he argues how much she benefited from his smaller moral slips in the past even if she wouldn't have acted the same way herself. His argument is so convincing that even the viewer could agree with him in a very uncomfortable way.The final segment does injustice to the beginning and the middle. It seems to go in various unnecessary directions and fails to continue the momentum built earlier. But ""Graduation"" is still a film worth seeing. It includes universal themes such as well-meaning parents over-planning their children's future plus a challenge to the belief that ""the grass is always greener"" somewhere else. And of course, the saying ""O, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive"" is well played out in the narrative. - dbamateurcritic"
" White Male Panic
",-0.5106,-0.9864,2018-02-06 00:00:00,8,"""Graduation"" is proof that the plight of the white male we're currently hearing so much about in America is not limited to the U.S.In the latest film from Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, our protagonist, the middle-aged Romeo, desperately wants his daughter to get into an elite British college. He hounds her day and night about her exams. She seems like a responsible, level-headed girl, but we sense that the whole thing isn't quite as important to her as it is to her dad. Then she's sexually assaulted one day, and the emotional and physical trauma the assault causes threatens to affect her performance at her exams. Romeo decides to take matters into his own hands and we watch as things begin to spiral out of control.""Graduation"" is a bit one note. We understand early on that Romeo is projecting a lot onto his daughter. He's unsatisfied with his own life, which is a failure in his own eyes. He has a desultory and sullen marriage, lives in what looks to be government housing in a poor area, and is part of a traditional patriarchal system that seems to be losing its grip. ""Graduation"" is full of scene after scene of middle-aged men striking bargains, calling in favors, putting each other in touch with a friend of a friend. But there's an increasingly desperate quality to all of the mutual back scratching, and we sense that these guys are beginning to feel what it's like in a world where they no longer call all the shots. The final image of the film lingers on a group of young graduating Romanians. What will become of them, the film seems to ask? What future Romania will they manufacture? The answer is unclear, except for the fact that it will likely not include a place for someone like Romeo.This is the third Mungiu film I've seen after ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"" and ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days,"" and while it doesn't pack anywhere near the same wallop as those other two films, it's still quite good. It reminded me an awful lot of the recent Iranian movie ""The Salesman,"" as both feature middle-aged men going to extreme lengths to influence circumstances that are largely out of their control.Grade: A"
" Pretty Unsatisfying.
",0.4939,-0.997,2017-12-06 00:00:00,5,"'Graduation' has established itself as the hottest and most acclaimed foreign-language flick of the year. In a very unimpressive year for films, I was hoping this would bring it out of its slump. After all, there was room for enough potential to be the best film of the year in general. Not at all.'Graduation' deals with the overwhelming pressures of parenthood, ambition, and professionalism. The main character is physician Romeo (weird that as a doctor we just about never see him in practise) living in suburban Transylvania. When his daughter Eliza was born, he planned on her going far with academia and study abroad. She has the best grades in school and got scholarships to prestigious school in the UK. She just now needs to pass her final exams. On her way to her first exam, she is attacked and seriously injured. This jeopardizes her state of mind and Romeo's plans for her daughter.So this is the story. Romeo, his daughter, and wife are all good in this. Obviously Romeo shines. But there were some seriously hideous elements that angered me and cost this a good review from me. The first and biggest is Romeo (about 50) having an affair with a woman about 20. He's still married, his marriage is rocky, but never do we get the extent of it and why he's been cheating for over a year. Romeo and his mistress is disgusting. And their relationship is never delved into. There's even a scene at the end when Romeo is looking after the woman's kid brother. Each scene with the mistress stuck out like a sore thumb and had a bad aftertaste long after her scenes were finished. This got me to hating Romeo right off the bat. And this subplot wasn't even resolved!Romeo being a sleaze-bucket made himself as a whole dead on arrival. His other flaws got hugely amplified. After is daughter gets beaten and sexually assaulted, he still pressures her into doing the exams. We do get to see how hard it is for her to get accommodations, but he's a doctor! She's emotionally scarred and physically injured, so why not sign her up for exams some other time? He just gave up with trying to heal his daughter and went back to pressuring her for school. Scarring her even more with this pressure could increase her suicidal risk! Fathers that are bigger a-holes would draw the line somewhere. I know he wants her to have a better life, but maintaining the pressure of exams right after her the scariest moment in her life mad me hate Romeo even more. She's your daughter for Christ's sake! Romeo has some other doctor issues happening with him. Potential lawsuits for him are in place. Good! That's what you get for cheating with someone half your age and being borderline abusive to your daughter! These bits are barely resolved. Actually, almost nothing in this movie is resolved! The little bits of closure that we do get is very forgettable and unsuitable for a picture like this.Adrian Titieni does a mighty fine job acting. I didn't like his character at all, but he does give some pretty juicy chops. So good that ""hate"" and ""could not stand"" are a bit too harsh of terms to describe my reaction to him. Anybody less talented and I would truly have hated him and the movie would have sucked. Director Cristian Mungiu also does a good job in making a gloomy picture that can suck the audience right in. A few good aspects were not enough to save this. Thumbs down. 6/10"
" Romanian Drama on the corruption that attracts when a child's future is at stake

Meanwhile he and his wife live to see their daughter graduate and move to England to study psychology at university. All she has to do is finish school.Then on the day before her final exams start she get assaulted outside the school. She is now an emotional wreck and all the careful plans laid over the last eighteen years are in tatters. However, Romania is the sort of place where if you have the right connections you can make things happen and so after a lifetime of doing the right thing Romeo finds temptation knocking on his door, that is to do the wrong thing but, in his heart, it is for the right reasons.This is a very European film in that it often leaves things hanging ‚Äì like life it is not all packaged for easy consumption. There is no musical score which adds to the mundanity of what is supposed to be ordinary in anyone's life. The societal issues are all dealt with in a way that makes them more or less matter of fact whilst not detracting from the base wrong doings that seem to be rampant. This is a film that uses a simple story to discuss complex issues that go into the very depths of belief and values and as such is one that is easy to recommend to all fans of thoughtful European cinema."
" Rather Pointless really
",0.0,0.8901,2017-07-30 00:00:00,2,"Wow - that was a slog !You would think that a film that is over 2 hours long would have something to say or a dramatic narrative that is punchy or deep. In this film almost nothing of any consequence happens.There is an attack on a young girl that is left unresolved and goes nowhere. There is a sub-plot of girlfriend who could be pregnant and wants to move on with her life that is left unresolved and goes nowhere. There is a story of the main character, a doctor, who tries to help his daughter with her high school grades by scratching some backs, which is the main story arc of the story, that ultimately again goes nowhere. Even the police investigation is another red herring on what promised to be a development of plot. So what is the point of this film ?. That corruption exists among the elites and would-be elites ?. That is hardly a shocker, even if the setting is Romania. This film could be have told in a TV one-off drama that lasted no more than 60 minutes because nothing is resolved and anything of consequence had no impact by the time the credits rolled. Save yourself 2 hours of your life. Don't bother. As for the high praise this film is getting either I am missing something of profound importance or the Emperor has no clothes."
" Well acted, well directed, probably realistic...but not entertaining at ALL
",0.2008,0.5759,2017-07-20 00:00:00,3,"This was probably the most disappointing independent film I have ever seen. I was expecting something thrilling, shocking and far more interesting than this. The situations are coherent, but it seemed like something that we see day by day; something that eventually we will manage to resolve by ourselves like a question on an exam. Something completely indifferent.The acting was descent, if not great. I would liked that the actress who played Eliza had more scenes, because her performance was the best thing of this movie. Romeo was good, but he had scenes that were very long and boring to death. Everyone else was find I guess.The script was realistic but, as I said before, it was like a bunch of conversations that we hear or have every day, nothing special actually.If you are expecting a shocking and unforgettable movie, this is not for you, because believe me, it is completely forgettable and probably you will want to have your time and money back, maybe as much as I do."
" A realistic portrayal of a Romanian family in crisis
",-0.6249,0.8678,2017-07-01 00:00:00,8,"A realistic Romanian drama about the struggles, compromises and implications of the parent's role in a family. This is a really intelligent, well made film that gives a bleak representation of contemporary life in Romania, particularly the youth who are told by their previous generation that they must hope and start fresh in a depressing state, though they are searching for their identities themselves. I liked that the film didn't stretch the emotional depth to a point that it seemed too unlikely or clich√© but rather describe an honest family situation. It did in places fall flat but it's ambiguous ending alludes to the mysteries and uncertainty of life which serves the premise of the film nicely."
" Obsession of the director by plane sequence is a ballast
",-0.34,0.2269,2017-06-05 00:00:00,4,"1642/5000 I see this movie, I have been very well. Little by little I begin to see that the whole film is cast with plane sequence, all the sequences have only one plane. I imagine he did it for pure marketing. The problem, for my taste is that in many moments the movie asks me to see things that I do not see. I do not care if you make a change of plan or do a good staging with actors and camera movements so that everything that has to come out on the screen comes out but the problem is that it does not and I see many moments with actors talking And I see only neck. Actors crying and I only see hair. Car actors talking and I only see the view from behind, that serves me.It could have been a great movie, the actors are all very well, or at least what they are seen. In making a sequential shot, the actors are asked for extra tension and perform it, but the director does not use it well. It's a movie that would be believable, but so many bad moments, it gets me too much of the film.The script is pretty good denouncing too many things, but the problem is that leaves many things half-way, without closing. The film begins with the breaking of a glass and I do not know who did it.The photograph is not good or bad, it is normal, it does not tell me anything, I know it is a Romanian film by the photograph.As I said I do not like the direction, but it is also that the film is too long and that has not been avoided either.Set today, everything about art, makeup and hairdressing is well taken care of.In short, it has the ballast of when it is not known how to use the technical resources well."
" Waste of time

It just meanders along leaving plot holes, unexplained events, and unresolved issues in its wake.

" Crushed Between Principle and Fatherly Love
",0.34,-0.6251,2017-05-28 00:00:00,7,"It's probably better to wait for Netflix on this, a pretty good‚Äîbut not THAT good‚Äîfilm set in the post-Ceau»ôescu era, where Eliza is about to realize the dream of her parents: escape from gritty, grubby, backward Romania to a real future in civilized England. She has tentatively won a college scholarship there and needs only to pass her upcoming high-school final to confirm it, but a shattering sexual assault has left her in no condition to take the test, let alone focus sufficiently to pass it. School bureaucrats' refusal to allow a postponement means the scholarship could be lost. The only solution lies in the sordid game of cronyism, bribes, favors and under-table, back-scratch deals that has long been a necessary coping mechanism for people under repressive regimes. Thus the moral crisis for Eliza's father: he's a surgeon, not only good but honest. He won't take bribes, favors and gifts for doing his job (people think he's joking when he refuses their 'incentive money'), but can he, this one time, in these extreme circumstances, dirty his hands just a little to save his daughter's future?"
" A father's dreams for his daughter are jeopardized just as she reaches adulthood.
",0.4404,-0.9887,2017-05-26 00:00:00,9,"Graduation, by Cristian Mungiu reviewed by NC WeilThis 2016 Romanian film by the director of 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, spans the time between a young woman's high school final exams and her graduation. Her father, a doctor, and mother, a librarian, though estranged (he sleeps on the couch and has a lover), both dote on their daughter, and their highest concern is her well-being. The girl is an excellent student, but the day before her exams she is attacked by a would-be rapist - in the scuffle her wrist is broken, but her violation goes far deeper than bones in a cast. Her father, a precise, methodical, and - yes - kind man, is determined to see her go to university in the UK where she has been offered a scholarship (contingent on high exam scores). He will do anything to make that plan happen. The assault is one more reason - Romania, for him, is a dead end. He and his wife are stuck there, but for their daughter, it is not too late. She must leave.The film opens with a rock shattering a window of their ground-floor apartment - the doctor certainly has a point about the benefits of living elsewhere - and he has labored to give her the chance to escape. But after the assault she gets cold feet.Strip away the differences between Romania's culture and our own, and the film boils down to a father wanting what he is convinced is best for his near-adult daughter, with his intentions overriding her own desires and distractions. Graduation is about leaving one phase of life to move into the next. The impossibility of planting your own experience directly into the heart and mind of a grown child is on painful display here - you have learned the hard way what you should have done, but she, rationally or not, has to make her own choices.For a parent, relinquishing control can mean one's life has truly been wasted - you didn't save yourself, and you can't save her either. But she's no longer yours to control - to insist on obedience is to keep her dependent, unable to be any kind of adult. In the end, that stunting is probably a worse trap than whatever limits her bad decisions impose. Mungiu's sympathy for all his characters forces us to recognize that everyone, no matter how corrupt or self-serving, is just trying to make the best of the life they're stuck in. Futility outranks evil in his compromised worldview."
" A father's desperate attempt for his daughter.
",-0.3182,0.9904,2017-05-14 00:00:00,7,"From the director of 'Beyond the Hills'. I have not seen many Romanian films, but a couple of his films, so I had an anticipation and it fulfilled that. If you are familiar with his works, you will love it too as well. It is an Oscar material like 'Toni Erdmann', but Romania had sent a different film. The film had achieved multiple things, including majorly highlighting the social issues and the education system, particularly from the parent's perspective. But it is basically about a father and his desperate attempts for his daughter for her better future. So it is something like 'Fathers & Daughter', but on one particular topic and the on- screen presentation was so realistic without the background score.Everything revolved around what the title suggested. A father who is professionally a doctor wants to provide a better education for his daughter. While facing a series of vandalism, his family gets a major shock after an unexpected terrible event. It was just before the daughter's annual exam. So it seems they're all disturbed by it, but the father is still not giving up on his daughter's exam, which requires a better score to get into the best university in the world. Apart from that, his other side of the personal and professional life takes some major turns. The film reveals all his struggles while breaking some moral laws.‚ùùSometimes, in life, it's the result that counts.‚ùûThe tale was told from the father's perspective and that character was seen almost in every frame. A good father knows what's best for his child, but sometimes crossing limits is what they do because of love and care. On the other hand, growing up kids, especially turning eighteen means that's when they actually begin to meet the real world. So basically they want to lose their parents' influence in their life as much as possible like when a baby bird starting to stretch its wings. Those stuffs were not prioritised here, but understandable from the developments we witness.From the social aspect, the corruption and educational demands, that's especially in the high scoring contest were the deriving plots from the main. The film could have been 10-15 minutes shorter if the father's professional side of the tale was not covered. It looked unnecessary, but fairly the part of the story when a slice of his life was what this film is about. I think not everybody sees the film's intention which is definitely not entertainment, nor inspiration, but kind of fact based on the parents.Yeah, I would have done almost the same as what the father has done in this. But due to some parallel developments in the main story, he had to face extra pressure from his own family. So unexpected way the narration takes the turn towards the final section. That's disappointing if you had supported the father from the very beginning. But a lesson he had learnt for his approach to deal the affair that he thought is slipping away from his master plan.Overall, a very good film, something you will learn how some people plan to deal a difficult stage of their life that's impacted by other surrounding developments. My only, slight disappointment was the crime part of the story which did not meet my expectation, but in most of the case that's how reality would be. So this is for particularly the drama film fans, because coping with the pace requires a little patience.7/10"
" Another top-notch film from Romanian director Cristian Mungiu
",0.0,0.9966,2017-05-07 00:00:00,9,"""Bacalaureat"" (2016 release from Romania; 128 min; US title ""Graduation"") brings the story of Dr. Aldea and his daughter Eliza. As the movie opens, some throws a stone at the window of the Aldea apartment. We have no idea why. We then get to know Dr. Aldea and Eliza (Aldea's wife Magda remains in the background due to real or perceived illness). Eliza is about to graduate and she already has two offers from great UK universities (with a full scholarship). All that stands between her and the UK are her last finals, where she needs to average a 9 out of 10 to be eligible for the scholarships. Then, one day before the first final, Eliza is assaulted during an attempted rape attack. That obviously overwhelms Eliza, and even though she is in no state to sit for the final, her dad insists that she does anyway. She only scores an 8. At this point we're 15 min, into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest project from Romanian writer-director Cristian Mungiu, best known for ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days"", but truth be told, that guy seemingly can do no wrong (in my book at least). Here, Mungiu brings yet another morality story set in your average Romanian environment. A middle-class doctor in a small city (Cluj) is looking out for his daughter's best interest, and his whole life is focused on giving Eliza the opportunity to escape Romania and start a new life in England. When not everything goes to plan, the doctor faces a moral dilemma: to try and influence the result, something that goes against everything he stands for and has taught Eliza, or do nothing and risk losing Eliza's opportunity to study in England. The movie approaches this dilemma in a nuanced way, and there is no easy ""black or white"" answer or solution. Along the way we get to know a number of secondary (but important) characters, including Eliza's boyfriend, the doctor's lover, and others. The acting performances are top-notch throughout, but none more so than Adrian Titieni (who won the Best Actor award at last year's Canned Film Festival, where the movie premiered).The movie finally arrived at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati last weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday early evening screening was attended nicely, I am happy to report. That sad, given the overall tone of the movie, I can't see this playing in theaters very long, unfortunately. If you are up for another top-notch film from one of the best European directors these days, you cannot got wrong with this. ""Bacalaureat"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Another Gem from Christian Mungiu
",0.0,-0.4962,2017-04-27 00:00:00,9,"All parents can be excessively protective when it is regarding their children. Bacalaureat unfolds the moral choices of a father to justify his decisions especially securing the future of loved ones and how far can he go? Besides, as it was said in the film, 'What is important is not the processes we have experienced but the result we want to achieve. We have to pass every tests regardless of the methods we choose in order to live the life we ‚Äã‚Äãdesire.'It may be a slow-paced film for some viewers but it is a complex study of a father's moral values as it was seen after hitting the dog with his car, he went to the same place to find out what had happened to the dog and then he came across with death body of dog and he started to sob because of the remorse. If he had left Eliza to the school at the beginning of the film instead of letting her walk, would the consequences be different?"
" Another wonder of Romanian cinematography
",0.0,0.699,2017-03-17 00:00:00,9,"Fist of all, Romanian movies are the most unique movies I've ever seen, so they deserve to be watched and talked about among those who watch. Bacalaureat (Graduation) is an example how you can make a masterpiece without extraordinary script, how you can see the very best of acting without some special dialogues, effects, etc. For those who are admirers of Hollywood this is not a perfect thing to watch. There is nothing special in this movie, nothing extraordinary, uncommon... However Bacalaureat is one of the most beautiful thing I've seen during the last few years. Romanians should be teachers to the other directors. I'm not sure if Romanians should say ""thanks"" to communism and isolation during the last century, I am not sure whether this is their way to express the feelings that they've had in the past. I am sure that this movie is a diamond among overambitious titles."
" After lifelong avoiding corruption, how attractive can it be to counter your principles in an exceptional case when a child's future is at stake
",0.128,0.9944,2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"Seen at the Film Fest Ghent 2016 (website: filmfestival.be/en). In the last four years, I've seen several depressing movies about corruption in former Communist countries. It seems a popular topic in the area, as can be readily derived from noteworthy examples like Durak/The Fool (Bykov 2014), Dolgaya Schastlivaya Zhizn/A Long And Happy Life (Khlebnikov 2013), and Leviathan (Zvyagintsev 2014). Even though the movie at hand follows suit on the same path, it however winds up being not that depressing as the others. Especially the final scenes brought some silver lining for the country's future, albeit that I'm not so sure it is the actual message that the film makers try to drive home.Anyway, the running time is more than 2 hours, but I could not spot any boring or redundant scene. Everything included in the script was necessary and useful, emphasizing how convoluted the tangled web became as woven by the various protagonists. It made abundantly clear that one step causes the next step, and so on and so on, until the point that no backpedaling is possible anymore. In other words, the original policy of our lead character Romeo may not have brought him wealth or influence in the past, yet his route was straightforward and devoid of complex deals deserving counter deals to make the circle round.The threesome family seemed a happy family from the outset, which proved gradually untrue in small steps. The case was not that their problems were unnatural or far-fetched, therefore it took its time for the cracks to become visible. Progress developed slowly but steadily. It was a surprise, for me that is, that there was some sort of resolution in the end. It countered the assumed morale of this movie (my assumption), that there is no middle road in corruption: either one steers clear of it, or one gets involved in complex arrangements from which one cannot get loose once started.All in all, two hours well spent while watching my favorite theme develop on screen, at the same time asking myself what I should have done in similar circumstances. Such thought provoking plots are very welcome, mostly also carrying an existential takeaway message hidden under an exercise for the viewer. We were taught that Honesty Is The Best Policy, but the plot of this movie lets you get doubts underway."
" Bad summary
",-0.5423,-0.5761,2017-03-04 00:00:00,3,"It raises some interesting issues: divorce, teens future, infidelity, rape, pregnancy, harassment neighborhood, up to foniatric problems... The problem is that not solves nothing.Aside from the above, the entire film takes place in a permanent whisper, without change of intonation of none of the characters.It is not badly acted, is not misdirected, but is not going anywhere."
" After his daughter is assaulted before a series of exams which will determine the trajectory of her life, her father makes the type of decisions which could risk everything.
",-0.6705,0.6957,2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"Noted Actor(s)Romeo (Adrian Titieni) | Eliza (Maria-Victoria Dragus)Characters & StorylineFrom the way Dr. Romeo paints Romania, you could understand why he would want his daughter Eliza to go to school as far away as the UK. He makes it seem riddled with corruption and criminals roaming the streets, a place he should have never returned to but he thought he could change it. So with all that in mind, he is willing to do whatever it takes so when Eliza takes her final exams, her pending scholarship to a prestigious UK university will be paid for and guaranteed. However, the world he fears the corruption of gets to her before she can escape.HighlightsFor The Sake of the Children vs. The Sake of the CountryOne of the things I found interesting within this movie, though sadly isn't a strong focus, is the idea of whether it is best to send your children to a foreign country to learn and plant roots vs. them perhaps getting a foreign education and returning home with that knowledge. The reason this was of interest is because Romeo really paints Romania as a terrible place. Yet his mother asks, why would you push her to leave and never return? If girls like her don't return, what hopes are there for the country to become better? An idea which, with Donald Trump soon to be the President of the USA, is an interesting one. For many have threatened, though likely not have followed through, to immigrate to different countries to avoid the consequences of his presidency. Yet, relating to this movie, if those who seem capable of creating change or at least crafting hope leave and never return, what does that mean for a country's future?This topic, unfortunately, is mentioned only a handful of times and isn't made anything which most may find noteworthy. However, in a sea of one mundane moment to the next, it was perhaps the one intriguing thought this movie presented.CriticismFrom The Assault, Affair, and Corruption, Everything Is MundaneIt's very weird when a person is assaulted, borderline raped, there is an affair in a movie, and there is a slew of corruption and even an investigation into it, yet there isn't one thing which can be considered exciting. Each character, and perhaps the story itself, almost seems like it is downplaying all of these events. The assault isn't treated as something huge, just a hindrance to Eliza getting the grades she needs to guarantee her getting into university. The affair plot is all but accepted and with neither woman involved happy, nor you understanding how and why they fell in love with Romeo, again there isn't something to really get and keep your attention.Leaving the political corruption. As Romeo tries to figure out a way to give his daughter an edge, he deals with a customs agent, introduced by a police chief, who wants a liver for a favor. Leading to the test administrator being involved and while this all may be a minor scandal, a doctor pushing for an official to get a liver to help his daughter get high marks on a test, everything is handled without a hint of sensationalism, enthusiasm, or anything to snag your attention. Which if this movie was simply an hour, maybe even an hour and a half, that would be unfortunate. But with it being two hours long and none of these usually interesting or at least devastating to watch topics being of interest, that is a damn shame.On The FenceThere Aren't Any Bad Performances, Per seIt's kind of weird to say in a movie so dull there aren't bad performances. To me, I'm just so used to someone taking the lead, being passionate, conniving, or even comical. Yet, like Loving, in some ways, no one tries to step forward and stand out. For even if Romeo has the most scenes, the writing and performance doesn't make him seem like what you'd expect from a lead actor. If anything, he more so seems like he is part of an ensemble and is just taking on more of the movie's focus due to one of the other actors being sick, having schedule conflicts, or simply being unreliable.Overall: Negative (Skip It)As noted, across many a review, passionate performances, troubled or worrisome childhoods, comedic moments, that is what I live for. That, nine times out of ten, is what excites me no matter if it is a book, movie, TV show, video game, or a theatrical production. Yet, despite this movie having many elements of what usually leads to good performances and an entertaining experience, it falls short. It falls off a cliff actually. However, it doesn't necessarily seem bad. It is just that the movie takes a path not often tread and the lack of emotion, someone with charisma, and no one who really snags you makes it hard to be faithful to a two-hour movie. So, while I want to say this is something which is Mixed, I have to give it a negative rating."
" A horrible waste of time
",-0.743,-0.8541,2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"This must be one of the slowest, pointless and most disappointing movies I have ever seen. The creator probably had an idea for a story but stopped right there. If this was a 10 min 2nd year project in film school, it might have passed, but at 2:08 (that's 2 HOURS and 8 min!) its just a very poor excuse for the ""quality foreign film"" label. Every scene is dragged to at least 10 times what should have been its length. The questions the film is meant to deal with - parenting, Ideals, morals, state vs. citizen - are lost in vector-less hovering of each and every character. I would gladly have written a spoiler but I can think of no way to spoil this any further."
