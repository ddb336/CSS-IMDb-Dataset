" The tribune that's us
",0.0,-0.3382,2021-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Great movie! It makes you witness of the events that occurred on the days after Jesus death and beyond.The roman tribune is a metaphor for the skeptical western viewer...
the story deepens the feelings on what happened, it tells a credible series of events... although most of these events are not mentioned in the Gospels."
" Unconvincing Yeshua and disciples
",0.0,0.8724,2021-04-08 00:00:00,6,"I don't normally add to a long list of reviews, believing that no-one ever reads more than a couple, but I just wanted to express how unconvincing I felt were Yeshua and his disciples, whose personalities were so limited that they would never have got me to listen to their preachings, never mind convert to Christianity. Yeshua came over just as a fun sort of chap.They were far better portrayed in some of the old Hollywood Bible epics.That apart, the film was good enough."
" Awesome Movie!!
",0.6892,0.7477,2021-04-06 00:00:00,10,I absolutely loved this movie!!! To see it from a soldier's point of view was breath taking! Absolutely have to add this to my dvd collection. A must watch every year!!!

" Amazing
",0.5859,0.807,2021-04-05 00:00:00,10,This movie is one of the best movies to watch for Easter. It is really refreshing to watch a movie from the perspective of a non-believer. It instantly became one of my favorites!
" Key to understanding salvation!
",0.0,-0.1779,2021-04-04 00:00:00,8,We like watching on Easter Day because without the resurrection we're all a bunch of fools and idiots blowing a lot of hot air.
" One of the best in this genre
",0.6369,0.9726,2021-04-04 00:00:00,10,"I've seen them all and this is right up there with the Passion of Christ. How anyone can rate this less than a 10 is beyond me. Maybe I'm a little biased because I too am a follower Yeshua and a believer in His resurrection.This movie accurately depicts the faith of His disciples and soon to be Apostles after the crucifixion but before the day of Pentecost. This is the faith that conquered Rome in 300 years with no 2nd Amendment rights, no political involvement, no voting, no military service just love, faith, joy, and the sharing of the Gospel, the glorious Gospel of Christ."
" Very good
",0.4927,0.9808,2021-04-03 00:00:00,8,"As a Christian but also a person who loves great movies I found this movie to be very entertaining. Most christian movies I have seen in the past have bad writing and bad acting which is always a disappointment. The content may be good but those two issues tend to distract me from the message. This movie has great writing , great directing and great acting. It would be a better score except for the special effects which I found to be sub par. There are only a few scenes with SFX but I was distracted by how bad they were. Still definitely worth a watch and my family is going to make it a tradition to watch this movie every easter weekend."
" What if...
",0.0,0.8335,2021-04-03 00:00:00,9,"What I like most about this film effort is that it doesn't bring anything new in the way of Scripture, or history, but, rather, a new and different perspective - one that no one could explain better than a Roman outsider. The primary actors all do a good job; Pilate's apprehension with his own situation, Tribune's need for truth, his lieutenant's ambition, the Centurion's shock, the uncomfortable, spooked Legionaries. And dust. Dust everywhere.Cliff Curtis brings an infectious joy as the Lord - right until he makes eye contact and you know he knows you know that he is serious.Let Fiennes turn his eye toward you, and question your own efforts in your faith as he is his own. Let the film make you think. I think sometimes, what if the new 12th disciple had been a Roman Tribune?!"
" Deserves way more atention
",0.0,0.9702,2021-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Everything was great. Directing, acting, even the soundtrack and sound mix. It was all well done. Secondary characters were also great. It's been a while since I saw a Christian theme movie with so much quality in the story line... it actually feels like a movie should be. The script is so well achieved that you can easily submerge without you being Christian. You can understand and feel what the people in the movie feels and understand what drives them to do the things that they do. Summary it's a pleasant surprise. 100% recommended."
" Okay, but what is its message?
",0.1154,0.9485,2021-03-30 00:00:00,6,"The first half of this movie is great. It shows the other Roman point of view we don't see in the biblical Gospels, and it does a great job of doing so. However, by the end, I'm confused at what the ""inspiring"" message is. The tribune doesn't believe until he sees irrefutable evidence. Isn't that the opposite of faith? I feel like there was a missed opportunity to have a story of finding the truth without seeing it with the your own eyes that would have fit a story about Christ more relevantly."
" Better and better each time you view it.
",0.7003,0.9818,2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"You know you have a masterpiece when you watch it again and discover new levels of excellence. The story keeps you engrossed in it, the acting for the most part is solid and in some scenes excellent. Some say this is the unofficial sequel to Passion of the Christ. It's a fictional story for sure, but I like even better than Passion for focusing on the message of hope and coming to believe in something greater than ourselves."
" POWERFUL
",0.4215,0.9701,2021-03-22 00:00:00,10,"The most powerful CHRISTIAN movie next to the PASSION OF CHRIST I have ever seen.FIENNES should have won an Oscar; his ability to express his Holy spiritual acceptance of JESUS as the SAVIOR of this world was unprecidented.A MOVIE ALL NONBELIEVERS NEED TO SEE.
TOTALLY MAGNIFICENT."
" Not perfect, but good movie
",-0.6259,0.5709,2021-03-18 00:00:00,7,"The Story is exciting and the actors are really good. The only problem is, that there isn't enough time for the characters themselfes."
" Not embarrassing!
",0.3561,0.9477,2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,"It is sadly all too rare to find religiously themed movies that are not a cringe-y embarrassment to watch. ""Risen"" rises above the schlock with boldness and grit. Captivating story, brilliantly acted and masterfully depicted. Nothing heavy handed or preachy - respect for respecting the audience. Great watch even for the unbeliever."
" Accurate portrayal of Jesus's ethnicity
",0.0,0.7346,2020-12-30 00:00:00,8,It must have been really bold to cast Cliff Curtis as Jesus Christ. Kudos to the filmmakers.
" Great Movie!
",0.6588,0.807,2020-12-29 00:00:00,10,"Hard to find good Movies anymore. The Movie is about Jesus after his resurrection before he goes to heaven to be with his Father Jehovah Almighty God.
And he is waiting until Armageddon to put and end to this wicked world. Great Movie!"
" Surprisingly well done
",0.5106,-0.3612,2020-12-13 00:00:00,10,"The story of Christ's resurrection is told from the point of view of a Roman soldier. It is well-acted and serious. My only complaint is their insinuation that Mary Magdalen was a prostitute, and that is not scriptural."
" A beautiful movie.
",0.5994,0.9382,2020-09-02 00:00:00,10,A beautiful movie showing the horror of Roman rule and the triumph of true faith. A different viewpoint on the last days of Christ and His resurrection superbly acted by Fiennes and captured perfectly by director Kevin Reynolds. I personally enjoyed the film immensely and found it both difficult and emotional to watch at times. 5 stars.
" Like Many Good Things About Religion.... It's a Story
",0.6597,-0.3654,2020-09-02 00:00:00,9,"Ignore the carpers who are dismayed that the film does not fully conform to approved , verified, vetted, and fully certified and published ""scripture"".This is a first rate "" story"" that deals with a situation faced by a hard-headed Tribune who absolutely knows how the world works, until he is faced with something entirely outside his experience! There is no room for imagination and fantasy inthe Legions. Those fanatics clutching their Bibles are unable to imagine a realistic variation on how the death ... and resurrection..... of Christ may well have happened.An inspiring and thoughtful view of a major world religious event!"
" Respectful and highly watchable
",0.4588,0.5859,2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Following the crucifixion of Jesus in 33AD and the discovery of an empty tomb, a Roman Tribune is tasked with tracking down His disciples and finding the body.A superior Biblical film which respects the Scriptures whilst using the cynical Roman detective, played by Joseph Fiennes, as an extra dimension. This is a must watch for Christians and for those with an open mind."
" Modern Procedural Drama
",0.0,0.8519,2020-04-12 00:00:00,8,An interesting view of the crucifixion story. That alone makes it more interesting. It fits nicely with our modern penchant for procedural drama. Intelligent and well-acted.
" Better than other options
",0.4404,0.9746,2020-04-11 00:00:00,7,"I am not a huge fan of religious movies but Easter is such a beautiful time of the year and since we can't go to Church this weekend I needed my fix. Found this one with decent review. Joseph Fiennes was the reason this movie was good. I was able to follow the entire story and be entertained.One change I would have made is the actor playing Yeshua/Jesus. He has such a limited role in this thing but he looks like somewhat of dork. Yeshua is supposed to be such a powerful figure and he's got a ton of worshippers and followers.Nonetheless good movie, I enjoyed it."
" Good perspective
",0.4404,0.2247,2020-04-06 00:00:00,9,"I was refreshed to see a different side of the interactions with Jesus. There was a lot of different interactions that Jesus had during His time on Earth. It was encouraging to see his interaction with a Roman officer that contributed to His death. I thought the acting, production and story was done very well."
" Wonderful Story of a Conversion
",0.5719,0.9746,2020-02-26 00:00:00,10,"I just love this film, from the scenery, the way the characters are represented, and the story of the tribune's conversion. He is very noble, one can tell, which is why he was able to be touched by God's grace. I do think the representation of some of the apostles is a bit comical, but then they were just humble, ordinary men, weren't they? Prior to Pentecost when the Holy Spirit gave them all courage and strength, they quaked at the thought of suffering, they ran and hid when Jesus' enemies approached, and they doubted Him so many times. So truly they were not strong men until after Pentecost. I really like how human the Roman soldiers seem: a crucifixion would have been a terrible thing regardless, but so much worse when it was Jesus and everyone knew He was innocent. His very bearing bespoke this. Many of the soldiers probably got themselves drunk in order to bear it, but being high officers, surely the tribune and centurion wouldn't be drunk, so they would have been struck by Jesus. And we do know that Longinus, the centurion who pierced Jesus' side, exclaimed, ""Surely this is the Son of God!"" He had a clear mind and allowed the grace of God to touch him. Tribune Clavius' story is much the same. A wonderful representation of a conversion! Joseph Fiennes is absolutely wonderful as Clavius."
" Not For History Lovers
",-0.4168,-0.1531,2020-02-17 00:00:00,2,"Just a normal christian missionary movie.
But, it may help christian missionaries to convert poor African and Asian people to Christianity.
The guy acted as Jesus has no glory on his face. I couldn't see the holiness on him.This is not a story about Jesus Resurrection. Jesus was showed only 3 times in the film. The story is about How the Roman guy became a christian.Whole story is just one line. Jesus body was put inside mortuary and it was lost next morning."
" The Afterlife Of Brian
",0.0,-0.2263,2020-02-04 00:00:00,6,"The post-crucifixion of that Jesus guy done as an imperial Roman police procedural. There's the captain of detectives (Pontius Pilate), who gives the maverick lieutenant (Tribune Clavius) 48 hours to solve the case, saddling him with a rookie sidekick, and it all takes place in the dusty Spanish version of Judaea. In the end (SPOILER) Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) goes over to the rebels.The dramatization or imperial Roman Judaea is as good as in Gladiator or Life of Brian, the Messiah himself is convincing as a 1st century carpenter channeling George Michael, and 'Risen' manages to keep its mojo until it dawns on you that it's no more than another sword-and-sandals, Bible-bashing would-be epic.I've seen worse Jesus movies. I've seen many worse police procedurals, for that matter."

" Surprisingly very enjoyable
",0.659,0.9914,2020-02-03 00:00:00,10,"To be honest I was expecting something completely different but this is a gem of a film that took me by suprise , Joseph fiennes was as usual truly superb , infact I really liked the whole cast even down to the smaller roles, for me the crucifixion scene was amazing be it difficult to watch, it felt very real,I loved the emotion pouring out of the centurion conducting the crucifixion played by Mark killeen the eyes say it all, cliff curtis is awsome as he always is, a very well acted well written brilliantly filmed piece of cinema👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼To everyone involved"
" Decent
",0.0,0.7906,2020-02-01 00:00:00,8,"I liked this movie it was fresh , modern , new and without some of the cringeworthy moments of older biblical movies it was realistic and 2 hour running time was good to pass the time."
" A surprising winner - a real chance to grapple with the mystery
",0.7845,0.9697,2020-01-24 00:00:00,9,"What a treat. Though at first glance (at least at the cover image) this smacks of a typical faith film, several elements set it apart. The coloring choices are grittier and more natural - not overly soaked in ambient light. The writers have clearly done their homework, crafting a tale that fills in the gaps respectfully and plausibly. A strong performance from Fiennes alongside very believable, human portrayals of iconic characters allows the viewer to step into the possible events post-crucifixion afresh. These are real people living in complicated times grappling with things they struggle to explain. As a final triumph, this film quietly provides perhaps the most authentic portrayal of a 1st-century, middle eastern Christ to grace the screen - right down to the decision to call him Yeshua. I highly recommend."
" It's amazing!
",0.6239,0.9423,2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,This movie was great. I loved it. It was a great coming to faith story.

" The Resurrection Of Jesus
",0.0,0.7003,2019-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Joseph Fiennes star in this movie entitled,""Risen"". He portrays Clavius,a Roman soldier who made an investigation on what happened to Jesus after he allegedly resurrected after the latter's body disappeared from the tomb.The movie was definitely a good one that is why I gave it the highest rating. It was evident that the resurrection of Jesus was investigated from a Roman perspective instead of the apostles. Added to that,we get to see the process of the investigation as well as the conversion of Clavius into becoming a follower of Christ."
" Well acted but largely fictional....
",0.1406,-0.9352,2019-10-30 00:00:00,7,"I'll start by saying I'm an atheist and a rationalist, with a historical education, so this review may offend those of a religious leaning.Risen is a well acted film, offering up a somewhat different perspective, that of a Roman, on the life and death of Jesus. The reality of the time was, however, was far removed from this portrayal in important factual respects. Contemporary accounts, portray Jesus as a radical and like most radicals of the day, one not immune to using violence, to make his point. Moreover, the character known as Jesus, did not appear in the collective works that became known as the bible, for hundreds of years. Long after much of it, was written. He gradually evolved within the work, into the religious figure, many of a spiritual bent, worship today.Viewed then, as predominantly entertainment, this is a reasonable watch. That said, it does underscore the very real, pragmatic brutality not just of the Roman Empire but of all empires. Violence, suppression and calculated cruelty with a terror component (such as crucifixions) were stock and trade. So, if there is a positive to come from this film, its message of peace and equality, is certainly no bad thing.7/10."
" Beautiful drama; excellent sound track; fantastic story telling.
",0.9042,0.9916,2019-10-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a must-watch. It is so very well done and has the elements to really speak to your heart. This movie really brings to light the mind-disturbingly, difficult, and un-reconcilable situations the early disciples (and others) had to grapple with. The Resurrection. Especially for a proud Roman.
Joseph Fiennes, the lead actor has done a marvelously great job in portraying the turmoil and chaos that goes on through His mind regarding the life-changing fact of the Resurrection.
The testimony of the second guard in the tavern was raw and beautifully portrayed. Great acting performance. Fantastic work done by the script-writers.
The soundtrack is beautiful. Mesmerizingly beautiful. and I have had it on repeat for days on end now! It is just that good. It takes you so well into the setting of the movie, and reminds you constantly of the first century Jewish and Roman times.
I encourage you to watch this movie and gift it to a non-believer too. What a great movie for the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ!"
" Just a Great Movie
",0.6249,0.5994,2019-08-21 00:00:00,9,"Well written and acted. Plausible. Conceivable. Watch This. If you are seeking your Faith - if you need a tale of ""Ya-Shoe-Ah"" see this. Then see it again. Deeply moving movie. Mike Dewitt NY USA"
" my notes
",0.0,0.7742,2019-06-30 00:00:00,4,Well made movie with good production value. i didn't know it was about religion and i'm not a fan of religion in movies. as it went on it kept getting more religion-y. it was a cool idea to see it from that perspective tho (1 viewing)
" Accuracy sacrificed as usual
",0.0,0.9555,2019-06-26 00:00:00,5,"Well acted for the most part. (Except Matthew. A truly insulting performance.) Definitely high quality. Maybe not as good as Samson or even Exodus. But better than Noah, but what isn't?
A better version of this movie exists and it's called The Final Inquiry. I recommend that one more so.
Still the film does have some excellent moments."
" CSI Jerusalem.
",0.0,0.9748,2019-05-15 00:00:00,7,"This is something you don't see much of in today's world namely a religious movie that never forgot it's first and foremost a movie. The problem with a lot of movies that have a religious theme is they're way too heavy on the religion and not heavy enough on the entertainment. I get why this is a thing. After all they're made primarily for a Christian audience and they wind up preaching to the already converted. So unless you happen to be one that believes in the message, the movie is worthless.Not so with ""Risen"". We're treated to a movie with a religious theme namely you have a Roman who investigating the resurrection of Jesus. But you also have a movie that plays it out like a crime drama which is why some people tend to refer to it as CSI Jerusalem. The bonus is that the main character doesn't become a convert at the end. Or maybe he does. It's never actually spelled out but he does come out from this changed.All in all this is a decent movie with good acting, good cinematography and it doesn't treat it's audience as if they're stupid. Sure, it's primarily geared towards the Christian crowd but even I, an atheist, enjoyed it as entertainment. And maybe, that's the best thing about it. It shows that you can have a movie that both sides of the divide can enjoy.It might not change hearts and minds, but in the end if a movie can do that then your mind was already made up to begin with."
" An interesting take
",0.4019,0.9867,2019-05-05 00:00:00,7,The movie I believe really tackles the heart of the issue. Some times if not most its not the lack of evidence that deters someone but the fact of the matter is that they don't want to believe. That was wonderfully portrayed by the Roman tribune and I felt deterred from the biblical account a little bit. They also took the liberty of Jesus having a conversation with the tribune which I found a little bit odd but it did fit with the story. Overall it was pretty good but I would have liked to see a better conclusion even though I already have a good idea what happens next according to the biblical text.
" Exceptional
",0.0,0.9627,2019-04-29 00:00:00,10,"I have to start by saying that it's a shame this film hasn't got the acclaim that it deserves.Why?Because it is a film that it has to do with the Christian religion and generally in today's society these kind of films aren't politically correct, if you know what i mean. I am a Christian Orthodox myself and i have to say that this movie ''touched'' me and moved me. It covers the period from the Crucifixion of Christ till his Ascension,but not through the eyes of a disciple or a follower of his.It's how a Roman tribune witnesses it, trying to find the body of Christ after his Resurrection. Tribune Clavius played superbly by Joseph Fiennes is ordered by Pilate to find the body of Christ because the Romans believed it was stolen. I don't want to say anymore because i don't want to spoil it,but through his quest for the truth he will experience things that he wouldn't believe if he hadn't seen them with his own eyes.The scenery is excellent and there is no exaggeration in the story. There is also an evident respect by trying to tell the story in a very honest way and not to add any unnecessary visual effects, just to make it extremely dramatic. Again Joseph Fiennes is excellent and he should be very proud of his performance. That is an Oscar winning performance in any other film, but as i have said because it is a religious film it hasn't got him the praise that he should got. Overall an excellent film, that for those who have read and know the facts, will in my opinion be a classic."
" We do not need this kind of movie
",0.0,-0.9265,2019-04-28 00:00:00,1,"We really do not need this kind of movie. Religion propaganda that claims to be true, peaceful, helps people but conveniently leaves out the mountains of bad deeds that it has done. Completely biased and one sided. It even tries to paint the romans as being evil. Are you kidding me? They did bad things just like everyone else but they were the founders of European civilisation. Can't say the same for Christianity."
" Can't Find Its Plot
",0.0,-0.644,2019-04-26 00:00:00,6,"Risen is being marketed as a sort of ancient biblical detective story but I have to say, it fails completely on that front. At the heart of a detective story is a mystery, but anyone who knows the biblical story of Christ (most people), knows that he is going to find out that the body wasn't stolen at all, but that Jesus rose from the dead.The Resurrection is one of the most well known events in human history, even by those who don't believe in it. Having a detective story about discovering Jesus rose from the dead is like having a detective story about a person trying to find out what happened to the Titanic and coming to the conclusion that... (insert dramatic music here)... It Sank!As far as Christian Films go, it is a step n the right direction. Unfortunately it's a small step."
" I dare you not to be moved by this film.
",0.0,0.9319,2019-04-20 00:00:00,9,"This is an impressive historical piece set around the death of Christ. Determined to dispel the rumours of resurrection that might lead to further uprisings and the legitimacy of the cult of Christ, Pilate orders a Roman officer, Clavius, to investigate and find the body of the Jewish prophet and rebel.
Joseph Fiennes excels as Clavius and you really feel his frustration and then confusion as he works to track down the corpse of Christ. You don't have to be Christian to enjoy this historical film but clearly an understanding of the story of Jesus will help.
The solid supporting cast includes Tom Felton and Cliff Curtis and the film rarely puts a foot wrong. Kevin Reynolds co wrote and directed this film and it really is an overlooked gem."

" Splendid and Inspiring
",0.765,0.9302,2019-03-12 00:00:00,9,"This film is splendid and inspiring, beautifully performed by the whole cast, and well-supported by the music, photography & script. I loved the way it depicted the joy of the Apostles, because that's what Christ's message was all about: the Joy of Redemption for all our sins. Only two things were wrong with it, in my view: too much focus on exhuming the bodies, and poor casting choices for Jesus & Mary Magdalene, pushing the Marxist Politically Correct Propaganda that Jesus was a dark Sephardic Jew dressed in black, who looked more like the Muslim Mahdi, and pushing the old Catholic propaganda that the Magdalene was an infamous prostitute, which is all wrong. The Magdalene was a runaway sex slave, kidnapped and enslaved since childhood like ""The Levite's Concubine"", who escaped back to her family and Jesus for protection. And Jesus had light hair like His Father in heaven, in whom Jesus said ""THERE IS NO DARKNESS AT ALL"".As gifted Jewish actor Joseph Fiennes walked away into the desert at the end, I saw in him ALL the Jews walking away from God's offer of redemption, rejecting His Beloved Son. I wish they could hear Jesus calling out to them."
" Moving for some but gospel and historically inaccurate. Low budget shows.
",-0.3919,-0.6966,2019-02-11 00:00:00,5,"On this film you'll see (Saint) Mary Magdalene visiting a tabern in the days after the Crucifixion and learn that she was a prostitute --something none of the gospels, canonic or gnostic mention. Is she being mixed up with the sinner woman Jesus saved from stoning?Crosses are hinged to the ground for repeated use, while the gospels say that Jesus dragged his cross up the Calvary.Wardrobe is painfully amateurish; there's an assortment of armor styles for Roman soldiers, some dating two centuries back and several forth from 33AD. The helmet variety is specially obnoxious.The chronology of the Galilee events is all mixed up. Penthecostes is before GalileeThere are stirrups on the saddles, something not yet invented for another 100 years.Roman soldiers didn't fight in Judaea until 66AD; Herod had his own army to keep troublemakers in check. Pilate had only a small garrison.A Roman tribune leading apostles run away from a Roman posse looking for them? C'mon!The tribune's quarters are somewhat remindful of a Nazi policeman's office. Extremely Holliwoodesque!Floor level budget shows everywhere from sets, locations and number of performers, mainly extras.On the other hand, Cliff Curtis is the most believable and charismatic Jesus I've ever watched on a film. Joseph Fiennes delivers a solid performance that should have been exploited more by the amateurish direction and (probably) poor script."
" Epic Film
",0.0,0.9744,2019-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Risen is an extraordinary movie that is superbly acted and directed.. Joseph Fiennes portrays a strong male persona of a Centurion searching for the dead body of Yeshua (Jesus). His facial expressions convey a thousand words.

" A Roman tribune is assigned by governor Pilatos to carry out a bizarre investigation , to discover the possible resurrection of a man called Jesus of Nazareth.
",-0.3182,0.9943,2018-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Acceptable and memorable film in which a Roman Agent : Joseph Fiennes along with his helper : Tom Felton are commissionated to resolve rumors of the resurrection of an executed convict : Cliff Curtis .In 33 AD in a remote part of the empire called Palestine , sent to to disprove the resurrection and on a spiritual quest the Tribune discovers faith, friendship , wonderful events and a revelation that could shatter the Roman Empire to find the body of Jesus Christ . This is the thrilling tale of a quest to uncover the mystery of all mysteries and while an officer finds out a surprising truth , to discover the body of Jesus Christ who rose from the dead .Here is treated the Resurrection as a mystery thriller including noisy action , fights , suspense , intrigue and pursuits. This is an interesting treatment of the political and religious thought-world of the time convincingly developed and the intent of the filmmakers is ultimately both ambitious and entertaining. Interpretations are awesome, Joseph Fiennes as the doubtful Tribune gives a magnificent acting , he plays a hard-nosed investigator who finally finds out the marvelous truth , he rises to the occasion especially in the crucial last half-hour . Peter Firth is a credible governor Pontius Pilatus who sends Tribune Clavius off on a dangerous mission. And a nice support cast mostly formed by Spanish actors playing Apostles and Jews as Thomas: Jean Cornet, Andrew:MarioTardon, Thaddeus:Lorente, Joseph Arimatea: Antonio Gil , Jose: Luis Callejo, and Maria Botto as Mary Magdalene. All of them deliver some insightful dialogs.The picture has a Christian point of view that holds interest , delivering an enjoyable Catholic vision fitting itself to religious canon. This is an Usa-Spain coproduction being well set in Malta and Almeria ,Andalucia .Colorful and adequate cinematography by Lorenzo Senatore. Special mention for musical score marvelously composed by Roque Baños , plenty of catching and evocative sounds.The motion picture was compellingly directed by Kevin Reynolds . Kevin is a good craftsman with hits and flops , including titles as Robin Hood,The beast of the war, Waterworld, 187 , Fandango , Tristan and Isolda. Rating : better than average , well worth watching .This film by Kevin Reynolds had two previous renditions: 1987 titled The Inquiry by Damiano Damiani with Keith Carradine , Harvey Keitel, Phyllis Logan and 2oo6 The Final Inquiry by Giulio Base with Daniel Liotti , Dolph Lundgren, Monica Cruz , Ornella Muti."

",0.4215,0.9623,2018-04-02 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie, even with some of its faults depicting a time in history. I specially like that they chose the Resurrection, because we already have many options about the Passion. And in fashion with all the crime scene investigation on TV here a Roman tribune investigates what happened to the body of Christ that the Romans expected to remain buried, but somehow the tomb was opened and empty. As a story for the screen it is entertaining and with convincing scenarios most of the time, as well as good acting. The research does show in uniforms, the tomb, houses and furniture of those times, and a few aspects of the Jewish Temple. The research is only half done about geographical locations in Galilee, which this production unfortunately depicts as a desert near an ocean; or about the contents of the Bible: details like who were the real witnesses, what the apostles really said, etc. but oh well, it's literary license and enjoyable as is."
" A Worthy Addition To Anyone's List Of Easter Movies To Watch
",0.4404,0.9965,2018-04-02 00:00:00,8,"I really liked the perspective of this movie. It's told largely through the eyes of a Roman tribune, Clavius - played by Joseph Fiennes. As the movie opens, Clavius is leading Roman soldiers in battle against a group of Jewish zealots led by Barabbas. Immediately after, he's sent by Pilate to oversee Jesus' crucifixion and then, after the body disappears and rumours of Jesus' resurrection begin to spread, Clavius is sent to find out the truth- specifically, to find Jesus' dead body to put an end to this nonsensical story that has the potential to be a real nuisance to the Romans. This was a different kind of take on the Easter story. It's told through skeptical eyes rather than through eyes of faith. It's mostly believable. It makes sense to me that the Romans would want to investigate these claims of resurrection. From a Christian perspective it's a stark reminder of how small and seemingly weak the original Jesus movement was - scattered, frightened disciples under constant threat, but increasingly emboldened by the growing realization of what had happened. Fiennes was very good as Clavius - a Roman who obviously doesn't believe in Jesus as the Messiah or in his resurrection but who finally has a dramatic experience when he discovers the disciples in the upper room. It was interesting to have Clavius form a sort of partnership with the disciples - sharing their journey to Galilee and experiencing the risen Christ along the way, to the point at which you'd have to say that he was converted. Jesus (or Yeshua as he was called in the movie) was played by Cliff Curtis. Yeshua's dialogue was somewhat limited (what was important in this context was not his words, but others' experience of him) but I did like Curtis' take on Yeshua. Yeshua came across as jovial and good natured; humble and compassionate. Strangely in a movie about the Easter event, Yeshua wasn't central enough to the story for Curtis' performance to rank among some of the fine actors who've played Jesus over the years, but given the limitations of the role in this movie I thought he did well.The basic concept (inserting a Roman tribune among the disciples) means that there were several liberties taken with the biblical story. There was, for example, a healing miracle performed by the risen Jesus - but there's no record of such a healing in the New Testament. The movie also (and unnecessarily) buys into the wholly inaccurate portrayal of Mary Magdalene as a prostitute. I saw no reason for that except perhaps that it gave an opportunity to insert some humour when Clavius burst into an establishment and asks the men inside ""who knows Mary Magdalene?"" - to which all the men put up their hands. OK. A quick laugh perhaps, but hardly worth perpetuating the false portrayal in my opinion. For the most part, though, the basics of the biblical Easter story were maintained, and the crucifixion story - while not as graphic as in, say, The Passion Of The Christ, was respectfully shown and appropriately difficult to watch.Two other scenes that stood out to me as especially dramatic were one of the guards at the tomb explaining to Clavius what happened at the moment of resurrection with a mixture of shock, terror and wonder, and also the moment that Clavius burst through the door of the upper room to find the disciples but also coming face to face with the risen Yeshua - whom he knew was dead.I liked the setting of the movie. It seemed very authentic to the time period and geography. Overall, this was a very well done movie, and for those who have a play list of sorts of movies they like to watch at Easter, this is probably deserving of a place on that list. (8/10)"
" Perfect movie to watch on Easter
",0.5719,0.7845,2018-04-01 00:00:00,8,Truth and fiction combined to make a powerful statement of faith
" Good starting point, much less towards the end
",0.4404,0.8798,2018-03-04 00:00:00,7,"In my opinion the approach of this movie is excellent, that is narrating the resurrection from the eye of a contemporary roman soldier who witnessed it from a very special point of view: the one of an Roman officer who received the order to find Jesus's ""stolen"" body.While for about 3/4 of the movie the plot is really convincing, as soon as we get closer to Jesus the less appealing the story becomes.There are some clear problems starting from an ugly Jesus face (instead all who met him also in private revelations state that he is very handsome). Then his body is actually too fat on the cross and not so much hurt from the precedent flagellation. There is no water and blood coming out the wound that the roman soldier Quinto Cassio Lancino caused (and who became a Christian according to the Tradition)The other points are even more important. Jesus does not talk in the movie, he is quite embarrassingly out of words, while in reality He is a sublime speaker at all level. The authors clearly don't know what to say.The movie also makes a capitol mistake: the cloth in the tomb was folded and did not lay down. In the contemporary hebrew code of behavior that even children knew, this meant that ""the master will return"" as used at dining tables.In short, there is not much historical precision concerning the Gospel reproduction, while there is an excellent insight of the daily Roman life of a soldier in the Holy Land of the time."
" Different
",0.0,0.612,2018-02-27 00:00:00,9,"About half way in, this movie suddenly woke up for me. One of the soldiers who guarded the tomb of Jesus (or Yeshua) is found in a tavern -- and relates his experience at the tomb -- struggling to understand. I have no idea if such a scene appears in the Bible, but it got my attention. And from then on, the movie became -- for me -- a unique experience: causing me to experience key claims of Christianity as if they were real. The main character Clavius, a tribune, faces life-uprooting revelations regarding the nature of Jesus -- and the music/sound effects combine with superb acting to bring the viewer, totally, into the shock he experiences. And the conflict, moving through all strands of his life. Joseph Fiennes is always outstanding I suspect, as he is here as Clavius; as is Cliff Curtis, who portrays Christ; and Tom Felton, who portrays Lucius, an ambitious young officer under Clavius. And, as another reviewer says, ""...someone please nominate that Roman guard in the tavern for an award.""I may not be as shocked as Clavius -- I have been fighting battles internally about the nature of existence all my life -- but I did get a striking new look at what it would mean to see what he saw, up close and personal."

The Roman empire is rational, organized and pragmatic, but the locals are passionate, poor and sometimes fanatical.We see the events written in the New Testament from the Roman point of view (with some of the Pharisee role too), until later both narratives merge. The movie brings some questionings ablut the possibilities that many miracles were fabricated, but still, the little movement of Yeshua (Jesus in Hebrew) followers start to rattle the foundations of the status quo. The Jewish priests ally themselves with the polytheistic Romans in order to end the so called ""cult"", bjt in a world that offered very little material and emotional comforts, some hope that life after death will be better is a powerful source of converts.It explains the beginning of a religion that shaped most of humanity, but it is not in a preaching tone.

" It's About Time...
",0.0,0.8932,2018-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Hollywood, and other film makers, have always tried to paint stories about the Bible in a dramatic and often unreal way, (sometimes bordering on the ridiculous).

""It's about time."" I was skeptical going in, as I always am with all Biblical movies, but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and performances of this film. Well Done!"
" This changes everything
",0.0,0.8572,2017-10-21 00:00:00,6,"The film centers on Clavius Aquila Valerius Niger (Joseph Fiennes), a fictional Roman Tribune who is tasked to find the missing body of Jesus He is assisted by Lucius (Tom Felton) who is less inspired by the discoveries. The film starts with the crucifixion and ends with Christ's ascension at Galilee. The production weaves information from the various Gospels while omitting other information such as the resurrection of the saints, perhaps wanting to avoid the criticisms that came with ""Noah."" I thought the film climaxed at an hour into the feature where our Roman bears witness to the doubting Thomas scene. I was not overwhelmed by the performances. Joseph Fiennes was rather bland and unemotional. He lacked character. Cliff Curtis who played Jesus or Yeshua was less than inspiring considering his role. He played a rather subdued messiah who just simply smiled a lot. Bartholomew (Stephen Hagan) was perhaps my favorite as he had personality, and acted euphoric.In the film Pilate is concerned about some fictional upcoming visit by Emperor Tiberius. Tiberius never visited Judea, or had plans to do so. This aspect was poorly researched. Clavius finds the burial shroud of Jesus which displays the famous photographic NEGATIVE of the shroud, perhaps the biggest miracle of the film, as unintentional as it was. It was one of those ""tells"" that the film producers are more concerned about perception and making money than simple facts.Symbolically Clavius represents the modern skeptic who must open his heart and be shown the way. This plays well with Christian audiences who will overlook mediocre performances and various English accents for the message."

" different side of familiar tale
",0.0,0.9169,2017-08-27 00:00:00,6,"Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) is a Roman military Tribune in 33 AD Judea. He puts down a rebellion by Barabbas. After the latest crucifixion, rumors spread that a man named Yeshua (Cliff Curtis) is set to rise again. Pilate (Peter Firth) assigns Clavius and his aide Lucius (Tom Felton) the task of investigating the impossible tale.It's always nice to take a different spin on familiar iconic stories. This is one of the most iconic. It starts with Barabbas as a heroic rebel leader. While that's part of Biblical tradition, I like more the other interpretation of him as a lowly murderous bandit. It just makes the injustice of the pardon greater. The heroic version irked me while watching this. There are bits of good biblical yarn. It's not anything earth shattering. It's a nice and easy religious film."
" By Their Performances Ye Shall Know Them.
",0.0,0.9664,2017-08-17 00:00:00,6,"A tale of a responsible but weary Roman Tirbune in Judea (Feinnes, as Clavius) who is ordered by Pontius Pilate (Firth) to go and make sure the Nazarene Yeshua (Curtis), who has been crucified and hanging up there for three days is dead yet. ""Do him a favor. Break his legs,"" suggests Pilate, no unkindly. Clavius does as ordered, reluctantly because as a soldier he's already seen so much death. Clavius decides to bring on Yeshua's death more quickly by ordering a spear thrust into his side, and Yeshua promptly dies.But all the unrest isn't over. The Hebrew council, the Sanhedrin, need to be sure their authority isn't challenged by this newcomer who is considered the Messiah, so they ask Pontius Pilate to give them the body, which they will seal in a rocky tomb under the eyes of the Romans. This is to prevent any chicanery because there is this myth going around that Yeshua will rise from the dead. Despite the two Roman guards left overnight at the tomb, whose discipline was admittedly slack, the next day the ropes have been burst from the seal, the stone rolled away, and the tomb empty.The rest of the film has Pilate ordering Clavius to find the body. During an extensive search Clavius does, in fact, find the body -- alive and well, and still bearing the wounds incurred during its crucifixion. Not only that, but Yeshua heals a leper and brings about the miracle of the fishes. Clavius more or less converts, helps the apostles to safety but, unable to bring himself to join them in spreading the gospel, he wanders off alone and thoroughly despondent. He gives his esteemed and valuable Tribune ring to the keeper of a dilapidated inn falling apart in the desert. In the words of the old song, ""one thousand miles from home, and I don't even know my name,"" while the apostles are off on their several treks singing Gumbaya with all the converts they're making.The theme of the pagan warrior being converted to Christianity or at least to a belief in the risen Christ isn't a new one. See films like ""The Robe"" or ""Ben Hur."" But this one is a cut above most, partly because of the ambiance and mostly because of the intelligent script and some first-rate performances. The green-speckled rocks and dunes are almost lavender. And although the iconography is not as raw as Pasolini's ""The Gospel According to St. Mathew"", it's pretty rough. Everybody is dusty and sometimes caked with blood. In other words, the characters and settings look credible. Feinnes is outstanding as Clavius, who undergoes a transformation but winds up more bewildered than before. As Yeshua, Curtis has a distinctly unprepossessing appearance. He's not Jeffrey Hunter, Robert Powell, or even Max von Sydow. He looks like an ordinary Mediterranean type who, except for his ever-present smile, might not appear out of place in a police mug shot. Firth is smooth as the practical and unflappable, but understanding Pontius Pilate.Bad stuff. Not much of it. But the music is a cliché from beginning to end, what with holy choirs, as Yeshua backs away from the apostles into a rising sun and disappears in a blaze of glory, a blaze the mature viewer might well have done without. In ""Faust,"" the devil was modest enough to disappear in a puff of smoke."
" You can feel the nails... and the freedom!
",0.6696,0.9491,2017-06-06 00:00:00,9,"I, like you, have likely watched so many films on the resurrection of our Lord Jesus. And so many have been left wanting. Risen is no different except to observe that it fills in many personal blanks left out of most other efforts.I will just summarize instead of waxing. This film is superb in most ways! It is touching to submit a hardened Roman Tribune; at the crucifixion and death of Jesus, entwined within a struggle of Roman power and his sword obedience and his personal experience and therefore his undeniable belief. What would you do? You supervise the brutal execution of an enemy of the state, and then witness the same man alive beyond a shadow of a doubt. You can never, ever... argue with a man that has had an experience. And that man cannot successfully argue with himself to an untrue conclusion.This film screams... ""Jesus Christ has risen from the dead!"" Which is the only truth that separates Christianity from every other religion. Oh, but they ""stole the body""...! From the Roman government. A sealed tomb. Guards present and subjected to death if they failed in their duty to stand guard at the tomb. Not rational or likely. All of this is well addressed and noted.The inaccuracy most observed in this film is when Jesus ascends to heaven at the conclusion movie. This didn't happen at the sea of Galilee, or where the film placed it, but on the Mount of Olives. Just outside Jerusalem.But still I can imagine when Jesus ascended it wasn't this floaty, clean, nice, peaceful experience....... but I would like to think that when our Lord ascended it cleared the sinuses of anyone within and 10 KM radius. Love the blast wave! :0)I am not much of a reviewer, but really did enjoy this film. And it touched me! As He has always!"

",-0.3925,0.4076,2017-05-08 00:00:00,8,"It trims away most of what the Bible says, apart from the matter of the Resurrection that obviously has to be there.All of the early followers of Jesus were Jewish. There was a big row later on, when Paul wanted to admit as full Christians people who would not live by Jewish law, including being circumcised.Clavius could not possibly have been accepted the way he is.It is nicely done. Unlike ""The Passion of the Christ"", it is not obsessed with suffering and death.Like all modern versions except Passolini's, it totally ignores the radical anti-privilege message that is unambiguously there. I suppose Hollywood would not care to fund a film that would tell them they were sinners.Also nothing about chastity: also not fashionable.If you want to believe in Jesus, which I do not, then you make yourself ridiculous if you ignore the bits that don't suit you."

I found it strange that the movie was made in the USA but people have English accents as well as Irish and Scottish accents. The person they chose to play Jesus just looks like an average vagrant and nothing like any picture anyone has seen. actually thought it was a British movie when I heard the people speak but according to IMDb it is an American movie.

I have watched certain scenes over and over - I am an acting teacher and director - and the authenticity and precision of Fiennes acting in this role is exemplary. He deserves a much greater stardom. His brother is a stunning actor but Joseph Fiennes is better.
