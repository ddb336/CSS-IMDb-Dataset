" Emotionless and so, so boring.
",-0.517,0.4875,2020-12-05 00:00:00,4,"I'm so glad that I'm never going to watch or think about clouds of sils maria ever again. I hate so much about this movie, it's so boring and pandering. The only thing of interest in the entire film was exploring the polar opposite characters Sigrid and Helena. Unfortunately for clouds of sils maria this has already been done far better many times before.The twilight girl was terrible, I don't really see how her performance is any better than her role in the twilight films. The exact same complaints people have about her performance in those films are on display in this film too. Surprisingly Juliette Binoche was quite bad here, I consider her to be a good actress so I was disappointed by her performance. And unsurprisingly Chloë Grace Moretz was bad.Technically this film is also a bit of a mess. The editing was pretty atrocious at times and the soundtrack and score were kind of awful as well. The cinematography isn't awful I suppose, it's shot in the Swiss alps so that helps. When we aren't seeing beautiful shots of the alps the cinematography was boring. Boring is just the best way to describe everything about this movie, every element is so, so boring.I feel that this is down to presentation. It doesn't feel thoughtfully presented or like anyone cared about what they were making very much. The writing also didn't help make my experience more entertaining. The conversations are terrible a lot of the time, especially when Chloë Grace Moretz is involved.Anyway don't watch this. Also if you like this film I'd love to have a conversation about it."
" Pain and beauty of aging on stage
",0.128,0.8679,2020-10-06 00:00:00,8,"Binoche was very good and Stewart was really captivating. Stewart really is an amazing actor, I feel sorry for her for all the Twilight crap. It was fun to see her say the word 'werewolf' tho! I enjoyed the relationship between the main characters. It was delicious to see how Valentine doesn't hesitate to tell Maria what she thinks and how Maria craves her acceptance. There is some aspects of the story that I feel is left unnecessary untouched. I quite didn't understand Maria's fight against multi layer stories. I think it would be difficult to be such a successful actress without the ability to see basic human emotions and events in almost abstract surroundings. I'm not in any way familiar with the movie/theater world so what do I know. I felt like Maria was fighting against something else (aging? jealousy? change?) and it really didn't came trough strong enough. It was a little frustrating to watch, but perhaps that was the point.Also I now want to see the metastory Maloja snake!"
" Binoche has talent and beauty, but she's no longer young
",0.128,0.9881,2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"Clouds of Sils Maria (2014) was written and directed by Olivier Assayas.The movie stars Juliette Binoche as renowned actress Maria Enders. Kristen Stewart is Valentine, her personal assistant. Maria agrees to star in a revival of a play about a younger woman and an older woman. The reason the director wants Maria--and no one else--is because Maria played the part of the younger woman when the play was originally produced. Now, 20 years later, she'll play the older woman.It's difficult to describe this movie without spoiling it. It works because Binoche and Stewart have a real chemistry between them. And, of course, they are an older woman and a younger woman. Sometimes it's hard to know whether nature is imitating art, or vice-versa. That makes the movie more interesting.Chloë Grace Moretz plays Jo-Ann Ellis, the younger woman who will star in the play. She's a good enough actor, and does a solid professional job, but she's not in the same class as Binoche and Stewart.I enjoyed this movie, although it would work better on the large screen. There's some great footage of the Swiss Alps that would be even more impressive in a theater.I found two flaws in the movie that kept me from giving it the highest rating. One is a scene in which Valentine is driving to meet her boyfriend. That appears to be taken from a different movie. The second is the final scene between Maria and Valentine, which just didn't work for me.The movie has an anemic IMDb rating of 6.7. I thought it was better than that, and rated it 8."
" Bright acting, hazy story
",0.4404,0.9528,2020-07-26 00:00:00,7,"While the script by director Olivier Assayas is a radically mixed bag - it's generally effective when the film focuses on the characters but falls apart when dealing with the play-within-a-film, 'Clouds of Sils Maria' features magnificent performances from its female leads, Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, and Chloë Grace Moretz, to keep the story moving and lively. The film is a fine showcase for the actresses and they are luminous in their roles."
" Surprisingly enjoyable
",0.6249,0.9757,2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"This film randomly popped up on SBS on demand and so I watched it because of the actors, not so much the synopsis. And I ended up really enjoying it! For me the movie was more about how well the actors played their parts, great acting all around, and the fantastic scenery. The storyline was so, so but it created this wonderful mood, sort of melancholic. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the film was captivating and I couldn't tear my eyes away. It's not a film for everyone, that's for sure, but I think if you are curious about it, you need to give it a go, and give it your undivided attention (without distractions) It might surprise you."

The production made her famous many years before, playing the younger woman. Her relationship with her young personal assistant (a somewhat monotone yet oddly compelling Kristin Stewart) seems to be the central part of the film, for awhile anyway.

I follow the rule that every movie starts at a 5/10 and either goes up or down depending on the merit. This has something to get out of it but it really ends up being what the viewer wants to get out of it."
" A great lead but
",0.3716,0.9379,2020-04-14 00:00:00,6,"A film that tries too hard.'Clouds of Sils Maria' is one of those productions that attempts to be artsy and impactful, by making everything look and feel great. By doing so, it almost forgets to join it all together in order to solidify the plot.I don't hate this by any means, it simply does too much. There's numerous narratives here which just end, without clearer explanation. That does, I guess, leave it to the viewer to interpret on their own, which is good though not when it's every important path in the film.Juliette Binoche is excellent as Maria, her performance definitely carries things and she improves all those around her. Kristen Stewart is the 'best of the rest', but she always (to me, anyway) feels out of place in this world.It shows off some stunning shots of the Swiss municipality, has a great lead but ultimately fails to strike a chord with me unfortunately."
" Incredibly absorbing and original
",0.3744,0.743,2020-04-12 00:00:00,9,Densely layered mediation on art and time with a standout performance from Binoche surrounded by engaging setpieces - and of course beautiful scenery.
" Context is everything
",0.0,0.9958,2020-04-12 00:00:00,8,"I have read some ambivalent reviews of this film - to be fair, if it is taken only at face value, 'cerebral drama, pretty scenery, lots of talking, not for everyone', then perhaps they are reasonable enough; but I believe there is more to this film than meets the eye.First things first. This is an impeccably acted piece; Kristen Stewart and the ever-watchable Juliette Binoche give standout performances, the dialogue is sharp and intelligent - it is a pleasure to listen to and a joy to look at. On those grounds alone this is worth your time. But there is hidden depth also.
The villages, lakes and Alpine heights which feature in this film so prominently as to almost constitute an extra character, are dripping with significance. They have played host over the last hundred years and more to some of the most unapologetically powerful thinkers of the 20th century: Herman Hesse, Theodor Adorno to name a few and, inescapably, Nietzsche. Their world of thought looms over this film like the mountains themselves; the various interactions of Maria and Val/Sigrid and Helena are a lens (and an intriguingly feminine one at that) through which to explore the Nietzschean concepts of will to power and eternal recurrence; the ability, or otherwise, of the individual to embrace the self and to live boldly and without regret. This is fully embodied by Chloe Grace-Moretz's character who descends from her Hollywood 'mountain' like Zarathustra himself, laying waste to the propriety and moral norms of all around her, with almost deadly consequences. The lure of suicide tugs at character and viewer alike, though a conventional plot summary might not indicate as much.. in short, with all of this in mind, this film has the potential (depending on your own personal vantage point - which is a concept the film explores extensively) to hit you very hard indeed - it has certainly left an impression on me and I look forward to watching it a second time.Perhaps a film shouldn't require background reading to succeed, but like most worthwhile creative output, I think this film has the potential to reward whatever time you put in to understanding it."
" Natural acting
",0.3612,0.9013,2020-04-08 00:00:00,6,Very natural acting. I truly expected no surprises out of this movie so I was taken aback by it a bit. Beautifully shot film. Interesting to see inside the machine of an actor's life vs. a actor's/celebrity's life.

" This movie is boring as hell.:)
",-0.3182,0.9682,2020-01-12 00:00:00,2,"This movie might have won prices but the only good part about it is the acting of Kristen Stewart and nice cinematic shots of the Swiss Alps. I have never considered Juliette Binoche a good actress. In this movie she overacts and it is completely unnatural. It's makes her character seem like something that escaped from a mental hospital and puts all of us Europeans to shame, lol. If I were an American I would think:""what kind of movies do these Europeans make?"" Hence, even as a European I think that. 😂 The only good European movie from the later era is ""Gegen die Wand"" (Head-on). A German-Turkish production with an awesome alternative/punk soundtrack. Go see it!"
" What is the point?
",0.0,0.8391,2019-12-25 00:00:00,2,"I found none of the characters worth knowing, although I found the acting entirely persuasive (I could imagine they were who they pretended to be). The writer sets them together in a series of interactions, not really a plot, that seem to elicit questions of identity and internal development, but they aren't quite fleshed out and they are not resolved. So the viewer is left, at the end, with no meaning substantially realized.Why are these lives important to me as a viewer and what are they to mean to me? These essential questions go unanswered and I wonder what I could have been doing in the two hours I spent watching that might have given me something either to enjoy it or to live by in some wisdom a film can, at times, impart."
" Dumb Euros
",-0.5106,-0.5719,2019-12-20 00:00:00,5,"One of the first things I thought about after watching this film was just how disparate the American and European way of looking at things has become, and how unaware this film seems to be of it. The script sounds like it should've been written over 200 years ago in Jena, the philosophical problems of ""reflection"" which the film approaches are continued in pieces of scholarship outside of German Romanticism and other post-enlightenment fields of thought, though you wouldn't know this from watching. What is most fascinating to me is the acclaim which the film has received in Europe, and how brutally unaware the Europeans are of how fixedly the film is attached to all the continent's genre trappings. The questions characters pose to each other and the answers which the Americans (those who are supposed to represent the ""continuation"" of the European tradition in some strange self-reflexive way) give are facile and fail to engage with any contemporary criticism--there is absolutely no way that Americans working within the theater wouldn't have thoughts regarding ""performativity""; though any and all of the possible postmodern or post-structuralist ideas that actual Americans live with and work in (Pose, Frozen II, Joker (2019), Roma, etc.) are obscured by these conspicuously European voices speaking out of American mouths."
" Three women
",0.0,0.9971,2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Cinema is likely the most democratic of art forms, encompassing pop as well as the finer, more challenging intellectual philosophies. It always pays to know your own likes before buying a ticket to something, and Olivier Assayas' ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" certainly isn't the purview of the masses or those who only require cinema to fit comfortably with their expectations or past experiences.I saw this film on Netflix after watching a later Assayas film, ""Personal Assistant."" Both feature American actress Kristen Stewart and both films mirror one another only because in both, Stewart plays a personal assistant...and Coco Chanel's fashions have a role...in one film more than the other.""The Clouds of Sil Maria"" is a towering intellectual achievement dealing with an actress facing the end of her career and asked to participate in the production of a theatrical play about an older woman's infatuation with a younger one. In this new production and in her maturity she's asked to switch characters and instead play the older character, which brings into focus many things in her life that are unconscious, and she's struggling whether or not she wants to face them. That is the sum of the film we're watching but it doesn't unfold in linear form. Rather within conversations she has with her young assistant, and later through rehearsing the lines for the play itself with this young assistant.The play of her youth is named ""Maloja Snake"" which is a famous weather pattern in the Alps, where in the right conditions clouds stream into a valley resembling a snake. As the film opens, she is journeying to a ceremony to accept an award for the playwright of ""Maloja Snake,"" who has asked her to decline the award. We meet her and her assistant on the train to the award ceremony, and afterward winds up at the playwright's chalet in the Alps for another kind of ceremony involving him, tagging along is the young assistant who is convincing her to take the role of the older character and also is a big fan of the actress they are considering to play the younger character which Helen herself began her career 20 years before.This is a clever construct in the screenplay because is forces Helen to face her maturity and reason to consider secondary roles since her beauty, she feels, is fading. It's an ironic concern for Juliet Binoche, one of the most famous beauties of the screen at any age. And as the assistant, Kristen Stewart represents a different generation of actresses who (forgive me) seem to take their own physical attributes with very little concern. It's wonderful casting...and the result is equally thrilling.Into this dynamic a young Chloe Grace Moretz is introduced who while more aligned with Kristen Stewart's character's values displays a hardness and contempt for Binoche that threatens Binoche even more. And Stewart begins losing respect for and finding more fault with her employer Binoche. It's a very modern triade in today's culture, and Binoche's insecurity with her life and it's predicament begins to threaten her survival in the industry. Or so she thinks. She looks to Stewart more and more and finds less and less assurance. In that insecurity the film's one mystery presents itself. And it happens at a time when the two have gone on a mountain hike to view the spectacular Maloja Snake.The imagery during this sequence overpowers the viewer in such an overwhelming way, we tend to lose where we are in the drama. I felt that was the film's only weakness, forgivable since the spectacle of the event is stunning. But Binoche and Stewart create such vivid conflict and Chloe Grace Moretz' subterfuge are all formidable in what they're asked to do, all become part of film's conflict and the mystery. It's the work of a master who pulls all of this off.The great Angela Winkler has a wonderful, though all too short, appearance. She provides the hope for which Binoche's character needs both within the context of the film and as an example of what actresses have to look forward to as they age."
" A Good Starting Point for Oliver Assayas

The past and present and future have a sort of repeating chorus; it rhymes, it's like poetry. If you're a fan of modern art films or character studies, please check this out. Kristen Stewart and Juliette Binoche were both marvelous; Oliver Assayas proves once again he's got a lot to say, and in a way that no one else can; and the cinematography of ""the Snake"" cloud formation alone makes this movie worth watching."

How a character played by an actress can affect the changes in her life is being portrayed in this flick. It shows the clash of the two mantalities and describes the struggle one faces coping with the other.
" European charm
",0.4019,0.9941,2018-12-09 00:00:00,7,"A famous middle-aged European actress (Juliette Binoche) is aided by her loyal personal assistant (Kirsten Stewart) to prepare for a London remount of a Swiss play that made the actress a star when she was very young. In the remount, she is to play the role of a middle-aged woman in relationship with a younger woman. As she had played the younger woman in the play's debut, her insecurities rise to the surface now that she must now play the older role. The younger woman is to be played by a rising Hollywood star (Chloe Grace Moretz) who is often controversial.This film is mostly in English and is a Swiss-French-German co-production. It ably shows the differences of European vs. Hollywood values but without ever being condescending. As directed by Olivier Assayas (also the writer), there is an enjoyable European elegance and charm that make the film quite engaging. This is not surprising consider that Assayas has done such previous great works as ""Irma Vep"" (1996), ""Summer Hours"" (2008), and ""Carlos"" (2010).The ""Sils Maria"" of the title refers to a Swiss town where the two women retreat in preparation for the play. Binoche shows her usual fine talents in a rare role of someone who is insecure. Stewart does more than hold her own with Binoche.The middle section works well for the most part as the two women have deep discussions on the play and its characters while tension of their own connection is raised to the surface. The Swiss mountain scenery is also breathtaking in this segment. The trouble is that this segment lasts too long and begins to lessen film's overall impact due to its excessive length.Luckily, the final segment of the film restores it to its earlier glory, making it enjoyable overall."

The film succeeded in doing this. Enclosure and communication constitute the main contradiction and conflict of the movie plot. Every loss of the protagonist occurs in a sudden, forcing her to slowly begin to try to understand the world that was once too simplistic, and at this level, the theme of the movie it is quite traditional.
The boundaries between nature and drama are gradually blurred as the characters change, and this low-key design ultimately achieves the perfect blend of emotions and themes."
" Great performances, lazy writing
",0.3818,0.8625,2018-03-11 00:00:00,5,"It has become a hallmark of so-called ""avant-garde filmmaking"" to feature ambiguity and vague or incomplete story arcs. This is not art; it is lazy writing. Though the various synopses for this film concentrate on the Maria Enders character, played by Juliette Binoche, returning to the play which began her career after 20 years, but in the role of the older woman who is driven to kill herself (but maybe not?) by the predatory younger woman who became her lover (the role Enders originally played), the film is more about the relationship between Enders and her assistant, Val, played by Kristen Stewart. And then, all of a sudden, it's not. I cannot say more without spoilers, but there are more than one unresolved situations in the film, which felt to me like the screenwriter couldn't figure out how to resolve things, so they just ended it.Not clever, not art - just lazy."
" Talking about life, acting about art
",0.0,0.9505,2018-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Olivier Assays makes talky films about affluent people; but typically, they're thoughtful and interesting. 'The Clouds of Sils Maria' is, I believe, his first movie in English; and focuses on an actress, played by Juliette Binoche. She's about to revisit the play that made her name, but in a different, older role: this brings into light her own ambiguous feelings about ageing (and about the way that society views an older woman); there are also parallels between the themes of the play and her own real-life relationship with her assistant. It's very urbane, but one's sympathy for Binoche's character is limited by the fact that she is so damn spoiled - she's not especially diva-esque, but she nonetheless is surrounded at all times by a (small) entourage, though often they have their own motivations for ""helping"". One can wonder if her state of disquiet isn't just the by-product of being considered unusually important by others, a manufactured crisis in a pedicured life. Overall, I liked the film, though it lacks the emotional connection of Assayas's best."
" An intelligently crafted, and entertaining, drama
",0.7096,0.9942,2017-08-31 00:00:00,8,"While maintaining a sleek art-house-esque aesthetic and narrative, Olivier Assayas' Clouds of Sils Maria explores complicated human emotions, as well as sociological change, in a rather simplistic way. The result is a gorgeously organic and thought- provoking film that manages to thoroughly entertain, as well as inform.Juliette Binoche is a powerhouse of talent as usual, but who certainly surprises is the often understated Kristen Stewart, who, proved here, can work brilliantly with well- crafted material placed before her. The chemistry between Binoche and Stewart is simply electric, not only propelling the narrative forward, but making any potentially dull scene deliciously biting with their whip-cracking banter. It's not often that two actors so naturally play off of each other this effectively, to a point of wishing that their shared portions of the film were longer. Despite the crackling script and tantalizing character drama, there is a 20 minute epilogue that grinds the film's hefty momentum to a halt. While it is most definitely a necessary sequence for the story, it's lack of real substance is only amplified by the time it lasts on-screen. A middle-credits sequence would've left ample space for the story of the epilogue, but for whatever reason, Assayas stretched the finale of this intriguing story until it practically began to tear under the brilliance of the rest of the film.While arguably not quite as realized as Assayas' second effort with Stewart, Personal Shopper (2016), Clouds of Sils Maria is an impressively audacious study of mainstream film and celebrity status that is made rich and layered by the convicting chemistry between the film's leads. It's all so undeniably impressive, to a point where the director's shortcomings become all the more apparent, and in turn, more frustrating."
" Cloudy with a Chance
",0.25,0.9615,2017-05-13 00:00:00,5,"Rehearsing for a revival of the play that made her famous proves unexpectedly challenging for an esteemed actress in this French drama starring Juliette Binoche. While she knows all the dialogue, the difficulty is being asked to the play the older of the two protagonists (a la Michael Caine assuming the Laurence Olivier role in the remake of 'Sleuth'). Further tensions arise as the older protagonist is manipulated by the younger one in the play with Binoche wondering how close she may be to the older character. Fascinating as all this might sound, the film is nevertheless hard to get through at times with the plot not really taking off until 40 minutes in when Binoche views online clips of her bratty co-star to-be and tries to rehearse knowing what her co-star is like. At its best, the film blurs reality as Binoche and her personal assistant practise with it often ambiguous whether the pair are really fighting or simply rehearsing. There are also some memorable bits as the pair discuss whether science fiction dramas can have merit and the notion that ""thinking about a text is different to living it"", but these sparks unfortunately fizzle out before the film is over. As others have observed, the movie has a curious meta quality with Binoche playing an actress character very similar to herself, but the protracted first forty and final fifteen minutes oddly leads the film succeeding best in its middle section."
" Older Maria vs. Younger Maria
",0.0,0.9962,2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"The title refers to a town in Switzerland - Sils - where beautiful cloud formations hover and shift over the landscape. Our heroine Maria stays in the town while trying to sort out her feelings about a new play she is going to perform. She has come to the realization that she is no longer her ""younger"" self, and she does not quite understand who she is now. The title is a reference to the mental and emotional clouds that hover and shift over her or alternatively the ""clouds"" that she herself creates during her visit there. I will not repeat the entire plot here since every other review goes over that quite well. Suffice it to say that the older woman is Maria (Juliette Binoche), her young assistant is Valentine (Kristen Stewart), and a younger actress is JoAnn (Chloe Grace Morentz). Maria is cast in a play as an older woman who is seduced and manipulated by the younger actress, JoAnn. Since Maria once starred in the very same play in the younger part, she is at a loss how to approach playing the older woman. Her assistant Val tries to convince her that she can bring something special to the part, while Val also validates the talent and importance of the younger actress and her part. This is a formulation that Maria cannot, somehow, understand. Spoiler Alert:Val becomes increasingly frustrated that she cannot make Maria see the value of both the older and younger parts and she finally exits the movie in an abrupt and unexplained manner. This has given rise to many theories and I have my own. We can take the exit quite literally, but there is another level of interpretation to consider. In the story, I think that Val actually represents the ""young"" Maria, trying to tell her older self that she has gained something worthwhile through aging. Val has the qualities that Maria misses from her younger self - freedom, daring - but she has gained knowledge and wisdom that no longer allows her to ""dare,"" since she has a firm understanding of who she is and what she can do. She actually has freedom she has earned in her career, and daring makes no sense when she has a complete understanding of her strengths and weaknesses. Val exits the movie when she realizes that she has done all she can do to make Maria aware of this. Maria is just not open to that understanding. Or perhaps she is, and Val is no longer necessary?At the very end of the film, as Maria is still trying to find her voice, she asks JoAnn to make one small change in her performance to extend some grace to Maria's character in the play. It is the same gesture that Maria made when she played the younger woman, to allow the older character to exit the scene with some dignity. JoAnn flatly refuses, mocking Maria. At that point, Maria should come to understand that the difference between them is not age, but of character. Val was right, Maria should not covet her youth but she should value her own character and experience. It is not clear whether Maria finally understands this, perhaps too late?This movie has so many layers that you may continue thinking about it for quite a while, or you may just give up. But it is a very useful contemplation of age, and all of the actresses give outstanding and very distinct performances."
" Who Cares?
",0.4588,0.9914,2017-03-28 00:00:00,3,"I ask relatively little of movies, but do expect to be entertained, informed or stimulated intellectually in a meaningful way.That said, I agree with other reviewers who consider this to be a self-indulgent film, apparently only about acting, by and for actors. Neither the plot nor the characters are compelling or even interesting. Therefore, the claimed subtlety, sophistication and excellence of the screenplay and acting are not apparent since I'm not engaged enough to care. In short, it is uninteresting, unimportant and unmemorable (Bo-ring).A movie is like a song. The music draws me in, and only then the words or message become of interest. Without appealing sound I could usually care less about possibly interesting content. Clouds of Sils Maria lacks the music."
" No, It Really Is Not Like Birdman
",-0.5535,-0.9577,2017-03-11 00:00:00,4,"If this is ""Birdman"" for female actors, then we aren't paying attention. We're lazy, lazy people with no real respect for women. In ""Birdman,"" the main character gets to talk about the pain of human life -- universal feelings amongst all of us. He gets to rail at a snobby critic for that critic not having ever created anything and been vulnerable to criticism. The conversations are about art, creating, acting, being judged, growing up, becoming irrelevant, finding relevance, relationships with wives and daughters and antagonizing co-workers, the list goes on. With ""Birdman,"" the main character gets to have a second voice that is his -- another version of him -- which is so much more artfully and intelligently done. ""Birdman"" was a brilliant film. ""Sils,"" by comparison, is limp and slow, not at all nuanced, and super lazy as a thought exercise. The Hollywood voice-over during the trailer would sound something like: ""This one's old. This one's young. WHO WINS?"" And to be clear, that's not what _I_ think of Juliette Binoche and KStew. That's how dumb and simplistic this move is. The currency of youth is the only value a woman offers, let's talk? Bah! That's a privileged, small man's view, and an old man's view from a culture that values women mostly as sex objects and mother/mystery-goddess blah blah blah. What a pointless way to see half of the population. Beyond the supposition that these two movies don't compare, this move was strongly peppered with problems, moments that make you roll your eyes, and a lack of clarity. Over and over again, I kept thinking, ""Where did this conversation begin?"" ""Why is Maria laughing so hard and so fakely? Is that bad acting, or is it intentional to show her discomfort?"" ""Why is Val suddenly so angry? Did something happen?"" Look, if Val had been her personal assistant -- and clearly an adept and experienced one -- for so long, she would _know_ who this woman was. Val would've been familiar with Maria. Their relationship wouldn't have been so burdened by a time alone. So, her sudden disgust with Maria made no sense. Any long term, mutually beneficial relationship involves understanding and accepting the other person's foibles. So, for Val to so quickly become irked at Maria to the point of abandoning her in the Alps without a map -- whaaaht? Where did that come from? They disagree, so Val tries to make Maria's life end like Helena's did in the play? Or, no wait. Maybe not, b/c now Maria is alive and being offered a part in a futuristic movie, b/c she's a ""timeless"" creature. Oh. okay. Why did Wilhelm's wife burn his scripts but save a couple pages? Why the intro of some past lover Maria hates, but she gives him her room number -- even though this actress should have more self-respect than that -- and then we never see him again? Why does Val go along with Maria if she finds Maria's opinions and condescension so annoying? What happened between Val and Ber(nt?)? Why focus on the new pages in the play if we're not going to see how they change the ending of the play? Oh, because the ending of the movie changed? Ugh. Really? The relationship stressors were forced and not shown. The story was scattered and created a totally forced sense of loneliness only when it needed to. The characters outside of Val and Maria were one-note. (And frankly, the advertisements for Switzerland were not very well masked to be enjoyable. Lord, the number of long scenes rolling over the mountains. It's not as pretty as it is in real life. Cut that out!)I feel sorry for Juliette Binoche and KStew. They were good. KStew is growing, and I hope she continues to hone her art. Juliette Binoche was kind of amazing running her lines as Helena. My heart flew into my chest when she cried out and cleared the kitchen table's contents onto the floor. I felt something in that one moment, where the rest of the movie made me feel nothing but a mild sense of resentment at a male dominated hierarchy."
" Binoche and Stewart acting is phenomenal but...
",0.0,-0.2011,2017-02-23 00:00:00,3,"Did the director of this movie have a plan when he built this pretentious and ""décousue"" story? Like most French movies that pretend to be artistic this one is terribly boring and one wonders why the writer/ director has Miss Binoche burst into laughing other than using Miss Binoche's famous laugh. Is this movie a story about ageing actresses or a biography of Juliette Binoche? We get it, actresses have personal assistans and photographers and pretend to live a glamorous life. The only thing interesting in this pitiful movie was the comparison of the ageing actress with the clouds that predict bad weather in the Alps chain. The actress is so into her role that she becomes her character, at the beginning Binoche looks attractive with beautiful hair and when she is rehearsing for her role she has short hair and a duller complexion and looks older. Although I did not enjoy the movie I watched it to the end, sometimes fastforwarding to make it less painful and to see if there was another point to the movie...but no..."
" A Time-Waster
",0.0,0.4883,2017-02-08 00:00:00,1,"To begin, this film is pretentious twaddle. Full of the kind of cultural self-congratulation that has disfigured so many weightless French films in recent years. Ten lines of text for a review of this bland and boring dog's breakfast? Not worth your time or mine to continue. But, according to IMDb's guidelines, I must go on. The director's attempts to set up little mysteries here and there with hanging plot-lines are ineffective to dispel the film's stifling air of inconsequentiality. He also trots out a number of special effects, with the occasional aim, I suppose, of showing a character's mental or emotional state. It is all rather pointless. This swamps whatever gifts of characterization the actresses try to bring to their roles. (The actors, by the way, rarely rise above the level of the so-so, and are soon forgotten.) But don't take my word for all this: go to Richard Brody's review in the New Yorker issue of April 16, 2015. There he lays out, for all to read, the film's many mediocrities."
