" Lady(ies) Liberty - Winterim, The Foreign Film Festival
",0.765,0.9869,2021-03-23 00:00:00,8,"We believe that everyone who is interested in suspenseful family movies, will enjoy this. We appreciated that this movie is led by an ensemble cast of young women, but doesn't fall into the typical tropes of ""teenage"" films. The director was also inspired from the harshness of her own upbringing, and incorporated part of her experience into the narrative. We thought that the choice to imply a lot of the action, instead of simply showing it was clever, and made the events all the more compelling and interesting. The sound in this movie is also important, as it is at times the only indicator of certain events transpiring. We also loved the contrast between the ecstasy that the girls feel (at the beach, at the football game, or simply dancing and hanging out), contrasted with the despair they feel, as they are faced with the limitations of their family. The message that we took away from this movie was don't let others control you."
" Pretty good picture!
",0.75,0.915,2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"I had recorded this movie about three yeas ago I now finally watched it.
What a pleasant surprise! Is this the Turkish version of The Suicide Sisters? Well done!
My compliment to the five young actresses who did their job so convincing! Sad story though...
The music was outstanding and when the credits revealed who made the score... well, no surpise at all!
And the director did The Handmaid's Tale also.. can't wait to see more!"
" Coming of age the conservative way.
",0.0,0.9208,2020-04-12 00:00:00,7,"Many critics compare ""Mustang"" with ""The virgin suicides"" (1999, Sofia Coppola). I have never seen that film, but reading the plot of ""The virging suicides"" I think the comparison is quite adequate. My personal comparison was with ""Wadjda (2012, Haifaa Al-Mansour). In ""Wadjda"" a girl from 10 years old is a little tomboy and prefers to play with boys. This meets with disapproval in the Saudi Arabian town were she lives.In the beginning of ""Mustang"" five sisters from the Turkish countryside fool around with some male fellow students at the end of the school season. Because the average age of the sisters is a couple of years older than 10 this meets not with disapproval but outright panic (despite the fact that the fooling around looks quite innocent in Western eyes). The girls are imprisoned in their own home and the plan is to arrange marriages for them one by one.A few month ago I saw ""Little women"" (2019, Greta Gerwig). An important part of this film also deals with the March sisters trying to find the right husband. Their aunt does not have a very feminist view as she emphasizes that the most important aspect of a husband is being an income guarantee for his wife. In ""Little woman"" the sisters may be encouraged to find a man, it is at least left to them to find a man of their own taste. Nothing of that kind in ""Mustang"", where it is all about family and honor and the preferences of the individual are of no importance. Girls have nothing to say about their future man, but boys have equally little to say about theire future wife. The main difference between the sexes is that it is always the girl who is to blame for licentious behavior. Either she did it or she provoked it.""Mustang"" is strong in the imprisonment phase. The reason for the imprisonment was rather innocent (in Western eyes), but soon the girls start behaving less innocent. Their imprisonment acts as a catalyst for their sexual awakening, and this part of the film is quite sensual.""Mustang"" is less strong in the part of the arranged marriages. Every sisters reacts differently, but because we see the events through the eyes of the youngest sister the differences between the sisters is pushed too much into the background.One of the strong points of ""Wadjda"" was for me the alternation of comic and serious plot elements. In ""Mustang"" this is a weak point, because there is not really an alternation. There is only one comic episode (the football match) in an otherwise serious film. The comic episode therefore feels out of place."
" Beautiful
",0.5994,-0.0077,2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"This is an incredible debut. It gets going very quickly, and then the central part of the film seems to drift but in a very engaging way. The ending is stunning and so emotional, a look or a gesture says more than much of the dialogue.I see that other people have been upset by their view that this is not representative of how much of Turkey is, but who says a film has to represent everyone? When I watch an English film that has no relation to my own life, I don't automatically think that it's not a good film."
" NICE ONE.
",0.4215,0.0772,2020-02-25 00:00:00,8,"You feel for these sisters and really root for their freedom and happiness. It's depressing as hell, but the acting is spot on from an otherwise unknown cast. Women should watch."
" Almost Brilliant
",0.5434,0.9352,2020-01-06 00:00:00,7,"This is a moving film that if you are in the mood for you will enjoy. I don't understand why many reviewers refer to it as anti-conservatism or anti-Muslim - it's about equal opportunities.The repression of females hits you over the head and this film would have been much better if it had the male perspective on young men. Maybe that's another story to be told. It told it briefly in one story arc, but that was not followed up on.You can't judge history by today's values, but this film should have gone further to show the ignorance that opposes education. I loved how the 'Mustang' got educated and it was great that the 'educator' was a man.I thoroughly recommend this film as it is thought provoking and very well made. The director took some risks but managed to keep it very watchable.This film needs to be argued about. Watch and discuss."
" Good movie for non-turkish people
",0.4404,0.2883,2019-07-28 00:00:00,5,"I would like that movie if I was a french woman. The dialogs and events are so unnatural and unrealistic that I found myself following french subtitles. I was more comfortable in that way. Because I didnt feel like I was watching a turkish movie at all. I dont think anyone who lives here, who is turkish and know turkish culture well wouldnt make a movie like that. I am not saying we dont have issues about women rights or forced marriages or people aren't obsessed virginity. We do have these problems but the movie shows it in very wrong and unrealistic way. It was so obvious that film was written in other language and then translated to Turkish. The director doesnt even know the basic things about turkish culture. But it was a good movie for french people or european in general who pretends interesting in world problems."
" Disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.1984,2019-06-20 00:00:00,1,"Although the director wants to give an important message with the film, it's a total disappointment. It seems the director has no idea about the Turkish society and how things work in the countryside. I'm sure if a Korean or a Canadian decided to shoot a movie about Turkey, they'd do a better job coz they'd make an effort to understand the context and the society. If I want to shoot a movie about a rural village of, lets say, Italy, I'd spend time there, observe the people and read about the daily life, culture etc. Unfortunately, the director didn't bother herself to make this effort. As far as I see, many people from Turkey know that there are many scenes which are totally unrealistic and absurd, so they simply didn't like it. For international viewers, they are not familiar with the society and context, so they like the movie as they cannot compare the movie and the society. Lastly, the Orientalist perspective plays a role in this movie. The representation of the oppressed Turkish women is an appealing subject. I think that is also one of the reasons why this movie is loved this much. This is not to say that the issues addressed in the film are not important. There are many women in Turkey who are oppressed and it is important to raise awareness about this. The film could do a good job to for this if only the director took her job seriously and made a meaningful effort."
" The right to bare/bear arms
",0.0,0.7012,2019-04-30 00:00:00,3,"""Da mi, la pistole, Cesare!"", Bound (1996)I ought to have been sympathetic to the girls' plight, but I wasn't and I'm not sure why.Perhaps it's because their (understandable) rebellion was done in an unintelligent and unsubtle way? Perhaps it's because it seemed like they'd suddenly been dropped from a tolerant liberal environment into an intolerant conservative one and so behaved completely inappropriately? Perhaps they just seemed too ""naughty"", rather than ""virtuous"" but repressed?I'd suggest that a film that fails to make you care, has failed as a film.And why does the uncle need a pistol? (And why is he allowed one?) Surely it's safer to be able to bare arms than to bear them?"
" Good
",0.4404,0.7717,2019-03-30 00:00:00,7,"Mustang"" is a stunning debut feature by Deniz Gamze Ergüven about five sisters in rural Turkey. Confined to their grandmother's house, the girls bridle against losing their freedoms in a story grounded in both laughter and tears, and above all in the resilient strength of these girls against soul-deadening strictures."
" fallacious film ever!
",0.0,-0.9347,2019-03-06 00:00:00,1,"The film represents completely unreal life of Turkey. It is not that much of a country to be shown as brutally conservative. I think because the director doesn't have much ideas about her own country Turkey, since she mostly lived her life in France or maybe it was portrayed in this extreme untruly way of lives to make the name in international platforms. I never say Turkey is a very open minded country if we consider the lives of young girls in small cities, but the psychological&psychical violence in the movie is totally delusive and I'm so sad to see how a director decides to manupulate and makes a movie in unrealistic way of her own country by the usage of nonsense scenario. But we must have understood, because now the director has become a hollywood director. Furthermore, it is very cliche film to get all those awards and it was the nomination film of france in oscars or maybe there are another reasons that we all don't know."
" AWFUL
",-0.4588,-0.9134,2019-03-03 00:00:00,1,Just awful ! Waste of time. Telling lies shouldn't be allowed. This is like fake news ... It's just a hateful movie towards Turkey.
" Feminist Colonialism
",0.0,0.9756,2019-02-17 00:00:00,6,"Native reviewers have already pointed out how unreal the depictions of rural Turkish people are in this film, and that the dialogue seems to have been dreamt up and written in another language first and then translated into the language spoken onscreen. Certainly the girls seem much more like sassy inner-city western teenagers than country girls in a Muslim nation.And this is perhaps the biggest problem: it's a foreigners' view of the east, seen through the ideological lens of western feminism. This lens assumes with a somewhat colonialist arrogance that if only Muslim girls could take a gender studies course, shave their heads and start self-harming themselves, like normal people do, everything would be alright for them.Yes, this makes the film easier for a liberal westerner to relate to, but only by misrepresenting the realities of the girls living in a very different culture, with a very different set of values and beliefs that are not portrayed here at all.Many others here have pointed out the pronounced similarity to The Virgin Suicides (and perhaps Picnic At Hanging Rock), and indeed it often feels much more an American teen movie version of the Islamic world than something coming out from that world itself.Other things seemed not to ring true, such as one of the sister's erratic and promiscuous behaviour and the sex abuse subtext thrown in at the 11th hour that doesn't make sense in terms of any of the characters' behaviours and is not fleshed out enough to warrant its inclusion.For all this, it's still a well-made film, and the emotional scenes feel powerful, if manipulative. The acting by the sisters in particular is very good, and there are a good number of nice, quiet moments well portrayed, but its ability to observe and report honestly is compromised somewhat by its one-sided agenda."
" Not a Oscar Movie
",0.0,0.2323,2018-09-03 00:00:00,6,Movie is not bad but not enough for Oscar nominated.
" Truly Amazing
",0.7717,0.9951,2018-07-01 00:00:00,9,"In a small Turkish seaside village, five orphaned, school-age sisters live under the care of their traditional grandmother and uncle. The girls' free spirits lead their elders to force them into a domestic prison and prepare them for arranged marriages.At first glance, one is tempted to compare this film to ""Fiddler on the Roof"". They both involve five young sisters who have no brothers and the main plot point is to have the girls ""married off"" according to cultural customs that are outdated and oppressive. The main difference is that in ""Fiddler"", the villains are outside the family and community; in ""Mustang"", they are within. (It is also easy to compare this story to ""Pride and Prejudice"".)Director Deniz Gamze Erguven has done a superb job with her directing debut as she conveys an atmosphere of young, happy spirits conflicting with depressing circumstances. She elicits fine performances especially from Gunes Sansoy as the youngest and most rebellious sister. But the greatest contribution to ""Mustang"" is its rich screenplay co-written by Erguven and Alice Winocour. It has many gems worth pondering. These include: a beginning and end that meet full circle in a surprising way; a different fate for each of the girls; a bizarre scene in which a bride's virginity is aggressively confirmed. (It might have been hilarious if it weren't so frighteningly close to the truth in many areas of the world - past and present); a scene in which someone ""turns lemons into lemonade"", using a very bad situation to their advantage.There are also some interesting characterizations in the smaller roles. The grandmother is tyrannical overall (though not nearly as bad as the uncle) but she occasionally shows that she really cares for the girls' well-being. This is best shown in a funny scene involving a televised soccer match. Her sympathies cause an inner-conflict as she has to save face to hold good standing within an oppressive community.Another interesting character is a laid-back, long-haired truck driver. His appearance makes him an outsider; yet, his treatment of women and girls makes him far more pious than certain hypocrites who claim piety.With its broad variety of drama, sadness, humour, lightness, plus a very emotional ending, ""Mustang"" is truly one of the best films released in 2015.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Screenplay by Deniz Gamze Erguven and Alice Winocour"

" Conformity vs freedom
",0.6369,0.819,2018-03-16 00:00:00,8,"Nice film about traditions, conservatism, freedom and hypocrisy.
An uncle and his mother left with five young female nephews after their parents died, spend a whole summer segregating the five to find husbands for them.
With the beginning of the summer the five girls pass from high-school, sea, friends and boyfriends to a real prison in a very conservative environment, which get worse everyday.
Despite the grace of the five girls who are able to have fun also in the traditional environment, the hypocrisy of their watchers gets unmasked.
A very nice film about the struggle between tradition and progress, and the grace and freedom of the girl power."
" Deserve all awards it has been already taken.
",0.4588,0.936,2018-03-12 00:00:00,10,"Thanks for the team for this amazing drama, i wish i watched before. It pointed many aspects of conservatism and raise women problems in Turkey and similar countries. I hope it will help to increase consciousness."
" Who is right?
",0.0,-0.9522,2018-02-25 00:00:00,6,"I was bored to death watching this movie, the movie makes the uncle as the bad guy who is bad and violent to the innocent girls, right? The answer will differ according to where are you from. If you're from Europe or America (The West) the girls did what any girl would do, playing with boys, sleeping with them, cheating virginity tests, lying and whatnot. but if you're from the east those exact things would be shameful for the girls and the family. but the film chose to portray the uncle as the bad guy and the girls did nothing wrong, but i think any sensible person would understand why the uncle had to do what he did."
" Not realistic.
",0.0,-0.384,2017-12-28 00:00:00,7,"I really wanted to like and love this movie when I begun to watch it but it doesn't touch the real problems of women of Turkey. First of all I know that this is a French production about Turkey and I am aware that it can never reflect the things as they are but still if the director is from Turkey, this should've been different. If the girls' family were as strict as it is shown, they wouldn't have found the courage to play with boys like that, in the water in such a province (by the way Artvin is actually one of the most modern provinces of the eastern region, the choice of place is wrong already). Let's say something like that happened. No one wears those dresses anymore, not even in the villages. It may be symbolic for the movie but it is really feigned for the native audience. And what was that book on sexual relationship in such a house? It would be impossible to find something like this in a place like that, Turkish people are (if they are close-minded) unwilling to talk or do anything about sex out of the bedroom. One of the most silly parts was the girl telling her grandmother: ""If you are to marry me this man, I'm gonna shout"". What the hell? In real world you cannot even tell something like that to your grandmother or anyone else from your family if the situation is that harsh. However, control of the hymen and the uncle's sexual abuse were -unfortunately- right. I think the director should've focused on domestic violance, sexual abuse and relationship with the older generation in a more different perspective."
" Mustang Review
",0.0,0.9837,2017-12-16 00:00:00,8,"The Film Mustang, is probably the best international film I have seen yet! I highly recommend this film for a feminine audience because it is about five young girls. It contained lots of suspense and I was always sympathizing for the girls because of their harsh living conditions. At first, I did not understand why the grandmother imprisoned the girls in the home, but I realized it was because the girls were doing unrighteous acts with boys at the beach. I noticed as each girls would get married, the family of the bride would host the wedding at their house, something that most don't do in the United States. In the United States, most weddings are held at a church or a special place reserved. I noticed that in this film, marriage was portrayed as a very big deal. As each girl came of age, or showed that they have reached womanhood, they would be married off. They didn't have to wait until they were 18, like we do in the U.S. In the United States, it is illegal to be married at any age under 18. In Turkey, marriage would be done as soon as possible. I also noticed that a girl could not get married if she wasn't a virgin. This film contained girls running away, or constantly trying to escape the household because they were under such strict rule. I don't think I would have acted any differently though. If I was living like that I would most likely want to run away, which is what the girls did at the end. I don't think I would have changed anything about the ending of this film because the girls looked at peace when they realized they were finally safe."
" delicate and tragic
",-0.4215,0.7684,2017-11-20 00:00:00,8,"What if The Virgin Suicides (1999) live in village in Turkey nowadays? They would be wise, rebellious, loving, curious but in the end they would be only seen as an object that should be well prepared for man. Very enchanting movie about narrow-minded, aggressive and discriminating society."
" Real life
",0.0,0.3403,2017-08-19 00:00:00,6,"A poetic, tragic, somewhat hopeful portrayal of real life. Real life where unfortunately, some women are still 'unable' (not allowed) to make their own life choices. I saw the film having quite a few great expectations about it, taking into consideration the theme tackled, the important praise it has gathered so far from well known names and award institutions in the industry, and why not, the rating it got so far here on IMDb. These expectations were not met, I say because of two main aspects: 1. The uncertainty of some important events throughout the film. I understand the idea of 'less is more' and the idea of building the viewer's tension however, I do not want to imagine a scene where one of the sisters is (may be?) abused, if that is not the case. There were several occasions where I could not really tell what was going on in reality, and it bothered me. Same goes with some scenes where some of the girls would engage in different activities with some of the guys. It bothered me because I could not really have an idea of who is really the bad guy here, or what is actually happening, is it a sign of adolescent rebellion or is it something more to it. 2. The ending. It seems so unreal, so pathetic. The dream is fulfilled however it is really unrealistic. What are the chances of it being final? None. In conclusion I would say that the film is worth the while however, it is not one to stand out, at least not in my personal opinion."
" SPOILER: HELP Neede: Questions about Yasin and Turkey. Can you answer? Please?!
",0.623,0.8655,2017-08-16 00:00:00,8,"I rated this movie 8 out of 10. It was very good and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I chose Mustang for our monthly movie group and we have some lengthy questions about the character Yasin and the movie in general. Since we saw the movie with English subtitles, we are suspicious that some of the details and messages of the movie were either lost on us or misinterpreted.Can you answer any or all of these questions? If you are from Turkey, please state so, as you may have better informed answers.Question #1: What is the literal translation of the Turkish title of this film? The English word Mustang usually is a noun referring to a small wild horse. A lesser known definition of mustang is as a verb that refers to corralling wild horses. Both definitions could apply here. Which definition was used for this film?Question #2: What job is Yasin doing with the truck? My guess is that he delivers cylinders of propane for use in home cooking. Is this correct?Question #3: Why would Lale look for Yasin's phone number on a shopping bag? Might a local gas delivery company advertise on a grocery store bag? Question #4: In the English sub-titles, Lale calls a company whose phone number is printed on a the shopping bag. She says (according to the English subtitles) that she is looking for a long haired driver named Yasin. The person who answers the phone says that they don't have any queer drivers. Why would he say that? Are we to believe that in conservative areas of Turkey, a male with long hair might be presupposed to be gay? Question #5: When watching this movie, I was initially worried that Yasin might assault Lale (he didn't and was, in fact, a sympathetic friend)). Was there anything about Yasin's speech, hair, clothes, or mannerisms that would have led a Turkish viewer to think that Yasin was gay? Question #6: Is this movie a social commentary to show hypocrisy and the abuse of women's rights in the conservative areas of Turkey?Question #7: I generally feel that youthful actors seldom give entirely believable performances. I thought all of the girls in Mustang gave perfect performances, but I can't evaluate their spoken lines (I used the English subtitles). If you speak Turkish, were their spoken lines as good as their acting?"
" Fine but highly unrealistic movie
",0.1027,-0.3291,2017-08-13 00:00:00,4,"Plot points are logical. Turkey has some issues with conversationalism especially in rural areas. But behavior of people are highly unrealistic in this movie.1) No Turkish girl in that age can defy their elders like that 2) No young Turk calls an elder woman as ''Hanım'', it is mostly used by elites or in working places. They should've called ''Abla'' or ''Teyze'' Actually, I could write more but there are tons of unrealistic behavior. Probable reason is obvious; the director is Turkish but raised in France. Shee doesn't know about Turkey. Her knowledge about the country is superficial."
" Quality
",0.0,0.718,2017-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Mustang film is a film that has not been popular in Turkey. Most of Turkey is a Muslim, Radical and Conservative country. Of course, it is also a reason why people do not understand film culture. The film refers to a very big problem. The influence of pressure and dictatorship on the children of the general family.This movie is actually a real story. Something that has been in turkey for years. It still continues. If you follow the news in turkey, you will certainly see family suicides, mass suicides due to husband pressure, suicides.Mustang is a bold film. Because it is about these issues, the issue and the playfulness are beautiful, but the quality and the quality are also problems. Of course, the fact that the budget of the Filmin is low is also effective. Is generally one of the most beautiful films in the Turkish film industry."
" Ignore the summaries....and just see this film.
",-0.3612,-0.9714,2017-07-30 00:00:00,9,"I've read the summary on IMDb as well as on Netflix and neither really does this film or its story any justice. It's not just a film about a traditional family forcing their girls into marriages...it's far, far more sinister and evil. Judging by the Netflix summary, it sounds like a comedy...and the film is instead tense, edgy and terrifying at times...not exactly the stuff of comedy!!The film begins with four sisters (they appear to me to be from about ages 11-16) playing in the water with some boys. But this is occurring in a very traditional part of Turkey...one where innocent play like this is interpreted as evil and sensual. As a result of the family's perceived shame, the grandmother and especially her incredibly malevolent son, decide to crack down on the girls. Instead of continuing in school, the girls are given crash courses in being wives...and the plan is to very quickly marry them off...even despite some of them being incredibly young. What happens next...well, it's something you should see for yourself.My daughter saw this film at a film festival and she talked to me about it. When she talked with other patrons, she was surprised how women perceived that the girls had been sexually abused by the uncle...whereas men who saw the film didn't get that same impression. I DID think this was the case (probably because of my experience as a therapist dealing with rape victims) but regardless of what he MIGHT have done, what he did do was horrible. The film is an unflinching indictment of traditionalist culture--one where women are essentially powerless. Having been made by an expat from this culture, it has a style and story that seem true and shocking. Very well made and well worth seeing, though the story is anything but fun despite the first 20 minutes or so of the film which is rather light-hearted. Instead, at times, it's heartbreaking and sad....very sad."
" Oriental Teen Legs

This movie is about sex, and white washing the western culture of sexism. You got it when politicians like European Union staff honors such a movie. Politicians ain't love art, they use it. This film makes western people proud by telling that only east has gender problem which is falsified by the film itself by showing a lot of teen legs to make it watchable.No art, no objectivism, a lot of sexism by the sexists."
" off topic
",0.0,-0.9089,2017-06-19 00:00:00,2,"This film is a great example of how a movie can be ''off topic''The director thinks that Turkey is a catholic based country. She doesn't know Turkey neither it's people nor culture. There is a totally misunderstanding or intentional attempt of diversion.It's filmed in Black Sea region of Turkey and the scenario is also having a body in this region. But the problem is; this region is not that conservative. Maybe it would be filmed in the southeast region then my critics would be little bit moderate. But never could be a indulgent level, just little moderate.Poff, no matter how she is rebellious, a Turkish girl never take a stranger from the street to the car and having sex with him, while his uncles is taking money from the bank. No one, believe me! Probably in the world as well.The girls are grown up in that region but somehow they are really effected by western culture. And having troubles with facing this west-east conflict. It's really funny.All the keywords like; incest, social pressure, child marriage, rape are used by the director. She set up her structure on these keywords. But the cocktail which is made by those key words is really insincere and nauseous.Of course the film has a message! Which is basically the easiest and effortless way, may be the one of the best clichés in the modern Turkish academia and literature. And this is ''Education is indispensable'' Just name it, say it and everything is gonna be alright! Oh my god. God protect this movie by the audience"
" Ugly and fake
",-0.7506,-0.8722,2017-05-01 00:00:00,2,"What a turd of a film! A very good example of orientalist done with all the wrong intentions. It does not reflect anything remotely close to the culture or the region but I don't think its something the so-called director and the script writer would care anyway. I am originally related to the region where the film was set and none of the characters actually behaves, talks or acts anything like those people. It is such an important topic done so careless. I cant even begin to list everything wrong about this picture. Its just so sad that people behind this picture get credit among the most respected platforms in the West. On the other hand, I believe, that was the pure intention of those people after all.. to abuse and exploit a such delicate subject. To sum up in two words: Ugly and fake."
" Excellent!

However, their games cause a scandal with unexpected consequences due to immorality. The family house is rapidly turning into a prison, training for the pair is replacing the school, and weddings are starting arranged. However, freedom-loving sisters find ways to improve under the pressure of their environment The main characters of the film are young Turkish women, aged 11 to 16 years. Like the Mustangs, the girls always find loopholes that lead them out of the close world of a grandmother's home into an endless world full of adventures. This film is very dramatic, it is, in a way, a song to the women's right to freedom. ""Mustang"" inspired me by the fact that absolutely any difficulties are surmountable, even those difficulties that are associated with such strong factors as religion, nationality, customs and traditions. I am reviewing this film, in those moments when it seems that I can't do something. I advise everyone to watch this movie."

",-0.573,0.6418,2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"first of all as a person living in turkey and knowing the culture of it very well, i liked the Mustang in many aspects.Although it is the first feature film of the director and does not represent our culture,traditions and daily life at all, i liked the rebellion against patriarchy.The director, in this context, is not successful in showing the features our social life.To begin with characters i gotta tell that they acted so perfectly even if they never been actress before.Especially the character of Lale impressed me through her open-minded wisdom, her braveness into new life.The other girls were a bit fade beside her.Even so they all were good enough to be applauded by spectators.Secondly the place that film was shot does not comply with the events and the characters.You can not see such events and behaviours in north of turkey.This mistake happened since the director doesn't know the culture of turkey very well and cant see the point of issue properly.Thirdly, showing girls innocent in all ways is contradiction to what this movie aims at.There is a huge difference to have a sexual relationship between married and single during teenage according to culture of my desperate country.As for me both of them wrong as hell.But showing the girls innocent when they r doing whatever they want is completely nonsense but ordinary for the director and for people who do not live in these land.Fourthly, what is the point of this film? To shed light on the sexual pressure or patriarchal persecution? What is it? is a still mystery for me cant be solved yet.As we criticize this film according to cinematography, it fail.Otherwise it is fine for documentaryTo sum up i like the struggle against men but not the idea of the director."

",0.5994,0.9892,2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Full of heart, Deniz Gamze Ergüven's feature film debut is about five orphan girls who once are seen innocently playing with boys on a beach, Which outrages their strict conservative guardians who confine them while forced marriages are arranged.This is a terrific film that doesn't shy away from harsh realities, which like the film says their lives change in the blink of an eye because of a wholly innocent event. It gives an insight to a different culture and in particular the way women are treated, the director clearly has a lot of influences from prison films to Iranian cinema.It is shot hand-held which gives the drama a sense of the chaotic and turmoil, that these girls no doubt feel inside. I was rooting for them all the way, all the girls were great but the youngest ""Lale"" played by ""Günes Sensoy"" was terrific capturing the essence of not quite teen, goofy, inspirational child, who you warm to more and more as the drama continues. It has some genuinely funny moments one involving an auntie taking drastic measures, to ensure the girls are not caught by the men once they have sneaked out to join the all female supporters for a football game.A heartwarming and heartbreaking film, with an excellent score by Warren Ellis which gives the film even more soul.One of my favorites of the year."
" overrrated
",0.0,-0.9784,2017-01-05 00:00:00,3,"This is probably the most overrated film I have ever seen and a proof of the poor quality Turkish feminism. Huge scenerio gaps, extremely bad reflection of Turkish family life and a bad understanding of feminism which is nothing more than free sex for the film. Conservative Turkish family life is showed as a monster and ruins the life of women. Probably every single low profile feminist voted 10 or more to this movie because there is no other explanation of such a higher grade to a junk. Scenerio is ridiculously didactic and meaningless as well nothing more than a bad propaganda video which steals one and a half hour of your precious time."
