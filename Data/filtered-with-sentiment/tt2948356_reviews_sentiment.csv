" I guess it's not good to judge people
",-0.3412,0.596,2021-03-21 00:00:00,6,"I understand this movie is a criticism against judging people based on their identity - with themes against racism. It's a good enough lesson for kids but just wondering if the metaphor is presented in a right way. Carnivores are still carnivores right? and there's nothing bad about being one, oh well that's the zoologist in me speaking."
" One of the best animated films in recent memory.
",0.6369,0.971,2021-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Not just a children's film, but a FILM for people of all ages to enjoy. Zootopia is a film that mixes real-world ideas with entertaining characters and a thrilling adventure. The eye-opening themes and pure motivation that one can get from watching this film were the aspects of it that shocked me the most. Fantastic film."
" Amazing Zootopia!
",0.6239,0.9882,2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,"I will review the movie call ""Zootopia"" This is a wonderful animation film that definitely surprised me! First of all, the animation is extremely well done which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. The amount of details is astonishing and watching it twice was not a punishment for me. The plot is also surprisingly well thought-of, being funny yet dramatic and it keeps you on your seat while also making you laugh multiple times. Although a city full of anthropomorphic animals that dress and act like humans has been extremely popular since animation existed, I believe this Disney movie takes it to a new level. It really does feel like everything took years to develop as the environment is complex and believable and the animal characters resemble their real-life counterparts remarkably well. It's amazing how they could produce a movie with simple jokes suitable for kids yet still silently addressing real-life issues at the same time. At last, I definitely recommend this movie for the whole family as I deem it enjoyable for all ages. I think Zootopia is a clever, fast-paced animated Disney film set in a world of walking, talking, clothed animals that live peacefully together, having supposedly evolved past nature's rules of predator versus prey. It's a story about an eager young cop and her investigation involves chase scenes. Zootopia is the rare animated Disney film that feels like it was made for adults almost as much as children. This movie is very colorful, fun, and has a good message. Will I remember it tomorrow? Probably not, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it today."
" One of the best animation from Disney
",0.6369,0.997,2021-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Zootopia is a 3D animation from Disney. The CG animation and the of this movie are very amazing. it is very flowing. This is the perfect animation for children and families. The color and tone of this movie are Eye-friendly color. This movie has a great story that shows the different animals that already evolved. They live in the same city as Zootopia. Like the different people that have different characters but live in the same city. The characters and the design of the characters in this movie are very nice and Attraction. This movie showing the friendship between Judy Hopps (rabbit) and Nick Wilde (Fox). Besides, this movie has many points that interesting to follow. Like it says in the movie ""anyone can be anything"", so Judy wants to be the police in Zootopia. Even though most of the police in Zootopia is a carnivore and she is herbivores. Finally, she made it. But the animals around her still laugh at her. In the end, Judy can make the masterpiece and become the top police. Moreover, Disney pays attention to the area where this movie was screening. Like the journalist in this movie change into the animals which relate to the land that they were screened. For example, in china is a panda. Also, the jokes in the movie are cute and new like the slot one. Which is the joke that I like the most. This is one of the best animations in 2016. And I recommend people who are fans of Disney shouldn't miss it."
" BEST DISNEY MOVIE IN A WHILE
",0.6369,0.9442,2021-02-12 00:00:00,10,"Disney came through with the eye catching, keep you on your toes, film. the fox was my favorite and the plot was just amazing. love the subliminal messages. great watch."
" ""The world has always been broken""
",-0.4767,0.9921,2021-02-11 00:00:00,8,"I gotta say this movie is a very nice chance of pace from the typical Disney movie,so much so it doesn't really even feel like a Disney movie,this movie is overall really really good,the premise and world of zootopia is frankly mesmerizing,most of the characters I think are very unique and likeable and ad a lot to the world prime example being the clawhauser character,he is one of the characters that makes this movie great , but easily the two things this movie does best is 1:the world building,everything in this movie has its own ecosystem (literally)two god examples of that is when Nick was able to guess were Judy was from and her background simply cause of her attitude,this not only makes the world more flushed out,it also makes the world and city feel like a real place instead of simply a vessel for the movie to take place in ,another good example is when duke weaselton and nick knew each other from this worlds equivalent of drug dealing,with again makes the world more real, and the second strong suit of the film is Judy and nick's chemistry,they just work together very well and there little inside jokes are all a blast to witness,overall a great movie"
" Best Diseny Pixar movie so far!
",0.6696,0.0,2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,"My favourite animation movie!
I wait the second chapter and the announced mini serie!"
" A very layered movie
",0.0,0.9165,2021-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Zootopia is not it appears to be, it has a lot going under the surface; it references a number of other TV shows and movies including, 'Breaking Bad', 'The Godfather' etc. It delves into issues much larger which are open to interpretation. Eg diversity and inclusion is certainly key themes. On a number of occasions reference is made to the fact that the population is ninety percent prey & ten percent predators. This could relate to a human population afraid of minority groups as threats. Another instance was where Hopps was called cute and she responded angrily saying ""no one calls me cute, apart from other bunnies"". That could be from when black people call each other by the N word and only other black people can use the term. There's also a part where a shop refuses to sell serves an animal saying that it's an elephant only store. That seemed very much like Segregation. It works on different levels meaning there's something for everyone. And even if just watched it from a surface perspective, it's a sweet story about bullying and acceptance. Each character has their own personality and problems, and that's shared during the whole movie. It's also very intelligent in the design of a city which has caters for animals of varying shapes and sizes, living and working side by side. The use of music is also brilliant. Overall, a very well-made movie."

" Lovely looking animation - just don't read into it too much.
",0.5859,0.9958,2021-01-04 00:00:00,6,"This 2016 Walt Disney computer animated film is the 55th Animated Disney feature. It has a rating of PG making it suitable for any age group, and it has a runtime of 108 minutes. Depending where you live geographically you may know this film as ""Zootopia"" or ""Zootropolis"". Directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore (with co-direction by Jared Bush), this is a buddy cop movie in a world where anthropomorphic animals co-exist.Judy Hopps becomes the first rabbit police officer to graduate to the Zootropolis Police department, during her first assignment she gets hustled by minor con-artist fox duo Nick Wilde (red fox) and Finnick (Fennec Fox). Her boss, Chief Bogo is ready to fire her when she takes on an impossible case; to find and recover Emmitt Otterton and thirteen other animals who have gone missing. She enlists Nick Wilde in the investigation as he may have been one of the last animals to see Mr Otterton. The investigation takes the two on a journey of discovery, about themselves, and the coexistence of animals in Zootropolis, and about who holds the power and what they are doing with it.This is a fun and enjoyable Disney film which ticks all the feelgood boxes that Disney films regularly This is a fun and enjoyable Disney film which ticks all the feelgood boxes that Disney films regularly tick. It is colourful and engaging, while having a story which can be followed by all. It is not too complicated that younger audiences cannot appreciate the fun of what's going on; and it's not too simple that an older audience can't be entertained by the complexities of the buddy cop plot. Among all the professionally written and delivered characters on show there were plenty of gags and homages to other films, take Mr Big for example, the Marlon Brando style ""Godfather"". There were also some cleverly transposed animals in positions you could easily imagine them; for example, a Lion being the major/leader of the pack or Flash the Sloth in a government position where everything happens slowly. While commenting on this I must also point out, as good as it is visually and as good as some of the characters are perceived - if you read into the film from a morality point of view (which a lot of people do), then you will find a bit of a mess here too. For example, there is a lot of virtue-signalling and morality being suggested in this film, which then goes on to make some of the delivery that is occurred a little hypocritical. There are veiled discussion of racism, sexism, and xenophobia on show, which then get easily dismissed for the purpose of happy closure in the feature. Historically Disney does not have the best track record when it comes to morals and isms in its features and unfortunately this does have its issues too. Rather than focus on those failings and commentate on how this makes Disney hypocritical of its chequered past I am going to sidestep them and just focus on the film. It is fun, it is colourful, the voice acting is good, and it kept me entertaining for the runtime. I do not regret watching it and heck, when I put my 4-year-old cousin in front of this he loved it too and never took his eyes off it. That is what this film should be judged on, and not judging and over-analysing it. At his age I was the same too, it was colourful and entertaining. So, as a spectacle and vehicle to pass time it is good, great in fact. It is pretty, it is entertaining, it has giggles, and it has fun and occasionally cute animals that are voiced wonderfully. Therefore, it is a film I am happy to recommend to audiences young and old. 6/10"

" The Best Film Of The Year, So Far.
",0.6369,0.9989,2020-12-04 00:00:00,10,"From the studio that brought you Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen & Big Hero 6, Zootopia surfaces as a highly original, incredibly refreshing, thoroughly engaging, surprisingly timely & delightfully subversive beast fable about prejudice & stereotype that not only marks a new creative high for Disney but is arguably the finest film that this legendary animation studio has come up with in their Revival Era, so far.Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the story of Zootopia takes place in the titular metropolis and follows a bunny cop named Judy Hopps who, despite her par excellent performance in the class, is assigned parking duty by her superior. But when she volunteers to undertake a missing-predator case, she is given 48 hours to solve the mystery or resign, following which she blackmails a sly fox into helping her, and uncovers a sinister conspiracy.Co-directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore, the duo put up an intriguing world on the screen that does have a fresh quality but there is still a deep sense of familiarity to it. However, where the two leave a lasting impression is in finding that perfect balance between its consistently gripping storyline & moments of pure hilarity. The writing staff also deserves a mention, for their screenplay brims with numerous pop culture references, parodies many renowned classics & handles its topical themes with care.The 3D animation is absolutely top-notch, for the images retain its crispness, clarity & vibrancy from beginning to end. The animators put up a vast number of characters on the screen, ranging from the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, yet they are all given a well-defined arc. Cinematography further enhances the overall look n feel of the story with its fluid camera-work, splendid use of colour palette & spot-on lighting. Editing provides just enough screen time to all the relevant characters while moving the plot forward at a blistering pace.The cast is wisely chosen, and all the actors do a competent job in lending their voice & soul to the mammals they play. Ginnifer Goodwin brings a bubbly side to the new cop in town and confidently plays her role. Jason Bateman plays his part with finesse plus his voice really fits his cynical con artist character. Also, the chemistry between the two is a highlight in itself. Michael Giacchino's ebullient score seamlessly blends in & compliments the narrative while Shakira beautifully wraps everything up with a catchy, uplifting & wonderful song that smartly summarises its themes & message.On an overall scale, Zootopia finds Disney stepping out of its comfort zone to tackle a bold, ambitious & risky project, and it is one gamble that pays off tremendously well in the studio's favour. Also, its arrival couldn't have been better, considering how its elements of prejudice & stereotypes mirror the racial hostilities present in our very own current social environment. An ingenious blend of sophisticated storytelling, jubilant humour & thought-provoking themes that amazes, entertains & enlightens without ever compromising with the fun factor, Zootopia is a definite delight for viewers of all ages, and is undoubtedly the best film of the year, so far. Strongly recommended."

" One of the best animated films of recent years.
",0.6369,0.9976,2020-10-23 00:00:00,10,"This is one of Disney's most recent big hits, and it's good to see the most traditional animated film studio experiencing again some days of strength and energy, after more or less twenty years of difficulties. The film was, in all fairness, a resounding commercial and critical success, in addition to having a pertinent story about prejudices and stereotypes.The story centers on Judy Hopps, a rabbit that goes to the big city with the dream of joining the Police. But things are not easy: she is small in a universe of strong and large animals, and her companions don't take her seriously, even when she gets her first arrest. Thus, she volunteers to investigate the missing of Emmit Otterton, one among several Zootopia inhabitants who has vanished. For that, she will count on the forced collaboration of a swindler, crafty fox named Nick Wilde. And she will have to be quick, because her commander has imposed a deadline for her to present results or to resign from the force.In addition to being magnificently elaborated and animated, this film has a really good story with a pedagogical and humanistic background, insofar as it teaches us to disbelieve prejudices and preconceived ideas, as only strong men serve for the Police or Army, or all foxes are swindlers. There are so many ideas like that in our society (all blondes are unintelligent, all Frenchmen hate bathing, all Russians drink too much...) and all are unfair or unfounded prejudices. In addition to this moralizing message, the film is entertaining with good doses of comedy (the scenes with the sloths are anthological) and an engaging and interesting mystery surrounding the animals that disappeared.In addition to the characters being truly adorable, the film has a very competent voice cast, and the synchronization between animations and voices is perfect. Personally, I really liked the contributions of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Raymond S. Persi and Maurice LaMarche, the latter with an excellent imitation of Marlon Brando's hoarse voice. Musical moments are also present due to the unmistakable voice of Shakira, who was also entitled to give life to a character: the slender superstar Gazelle. It suits her!Technically, the film makes an impact due to the superb quality of animations and visual effects. Colorful, it was so clearly designed and beautifully edited an mixed that animations and characters took on an almost palpable realism. The conception of that city, with all its distinct but interconnected biomes allowing a better perception of how animals connect to their natural environment, also deserves an applause. Finally, I have to praise to Michael Giacchino's excellent soundtrack and the original song ""Try Everything""."

" Clever analogy to modern world
",0.4588,0.7693,2020-10-13 00:00:00,9,"'Zootopia' uses all the advantages given to fable. The director's clever metaphor acknowledges sensitive race issues with so much wit and humor. Not just the race. People sometimes put self-limitation because of their sex, diploma, hometown, and other's preconception of who they are. Judy Hopps symbolizes everyone who fights against this stereotype constantly every day.The storyline of Judy and Nick solving the crimes of 'missing mammals' and 'predators turning into savages' + personal developments of two characters are complementary supporting each other. While two work together, they face their wounds caused by others' prejudice. Sometimes personal realization gives the leads to the crime.Diversity is the key word of this movie. Just count how many animals the director brings in to the film with each unique characters. From mouse to lion, all animals' personalities are so flavorful and humorous. Also, I find pleasure noticing each district with different colors, weathers, and characteristics. Animation team's efforts are well represented in this movie. It is such a high-quality animation to the level of being revolutionary."

" Wrong metaphor
",-0.4767,-0.358,2020-09-26 00:00:00,7,"Predators will ALWAYS BE PREDATORS! The story was all about breaking stereotypes and respecting others in spite or because of their differences. I can absolutely get on board with that. However, the vehicle used to convey this message was predators and prey living together in harmony. I gotta tell ya, I don't see it happening till Christ reigns on Earth for 1,000 years. They conveniently dropped almost all instances of the predators eating. Some of them were carnivores, which means they eat MEAT! When Judy Hopps makes a statement to the media that biological instincts could be the cause of the savage behavior, it's a gross understatement, not an irresponsible opinion. Sure, children may possibly learn appropriate lessons. However, they may also become confused by the same token. I actually really enjoyed the show. I just don't see, as an adult and parent, how the lesson can be effectively taught using broken nature. Parents could do worse than discussing it with their children."
" Great
",0.6249,0.9989,2020-09-19 00:00:00,8,"I remember that this film was shown a lot in our elementary school, and I remember that I thought it was perfect.
The story itself contain a smart commentary through anthropomorphic animals. Where the predators are suffer from a big hate because of their nature. The story is mostly serious, but sometimes when it wants to be funny, the jokes are a bit of a mix. The jokes can sometimes be really funny, or fall flat. Also, the ending did almost ruined the entire feature. But back to the good things, the movie has some clever and funny humor, really engaging action. It might have some noticeable flaws, but it is a well crafted story.
The animation itself is well crafted, the textures on the animal's fur looks stunning, the character animation is smooth, being more down to earth and the lightning is well done. Also, the backgrounds looks great with all of the creative ideas, and the basic structure. The designs are surprisingly well done by keeping them look more animated and animalistic than humanoid. This is the example of what Disney animation is capable of doing.
The characters are a very good case. Most of them are likeable by looking into their backstory, like Nick, and Hops having a really fun personality. The characters are well crafted and mostly likeable, and the once the movie focus on are worth remembering for a long time.
Zootopia is a good movie by every means, the animation is fantastic, along with pointless action but at least it good to watch, along with well crafted, likeable characters. This is a must watch for a Disney fan (since they will take a kick out of it), but also for non fans its worth a watch. This a great film to Disney classics and I really enjoyed it."
" Disney's one of the best creation
",0.743,0.9879,2020-09-17 00:00:00,9,"""Zootopia"", a dream set in a city where predators and prey live respectively in peacefully, is an entertaining, flawlessly planned children's film. This movie gives us a message. Zootopia is an extraordinarily fun and engaging film from Walt Disney Animation. Furthermore, the illustrators work superbly at making exciting character plans for many various types of creatures.
Zootopia is one of the best-animated movies up to date because of it's stunning animation. It's pleasant, clever, and truly smart. I appreciated the primary characters, and I even thought about them!
Bunny Hops, a small town bunny who's informed that she can't be a cop in Zootopia on the grounds that there will never be been a bunny police officer. The work will, in general, be finished by predators and huge herbivores, like an Ox that is become a police chief, voiced by Idris Elba. enduring police training in any case and gets allocated to meter maid duty, to the help of her parents. Her parents repellent the fox. They had a valid justification to give her fox repellent. the fox is one of the rabbit's enemy and when Judy was youngster, a fox cornered her at a province reasonable, offended her for being a rabbit, and sliced her face with his paw.
The story follows Judy forces Nick into helping her by secretly recording his fee to tax avoidance, having found out from photograph proof that Nick was the last to see Emmitt. Judy collaborates with Nick to find the missing Emmitt, and together they wind up see-through a hazy plotting. Judy praised Nick for illuminating the case, has become companions with Nick and requests that he join the ZPD as her partner. And at the end, Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner. Featuring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, and J.K. Simmons, the voice cast is particularly acceptable and gives some extraordinary exhibitions; making truly beautiful characters.
Judy learns some hard fact as she digs more into the secret, and also watchers will, as well. Being civilized doesn't mean pressure and immorality is disappeared. Additionally, achieving positive change isn't as simple as it appears. However, she is reminded by a good-natured yet microaggressive cheetah that ""only a rabbit can call another rabbit cute"". And also Judy regrets after her sincere intention is gone wrong, she said, ""I came here to make the world a better place, but I think I broke it.""
However, the composing is weighty in its messages about resistance, the legislative issues of fear, and not generalizing others. There's additionally a touch of disarray in how this universe of humanized creatures functions.
It's still Disney, however, and it closes joyfully and absents a lot of transparency. There's plentiful space given for prey like Judy to apologize to unreasonably charged predators, like fox amigo and for everybody to develop.
Lastly, it teaches us, ""anyone can be anything"". And it is one of the best movies of Disney and what I have seen."

Ginnifer Goodwin (Judy) leads the cast very well, while Jason Bateman gives the most memorable performance as Nick. Idris Elba and Jenny Slate (not Edie Falco or Constance Shulman, as I initially guessed... just me? Probably) are good too.The premise is actually my favourite part of this film. I'm not saying it's anything revolutionary, but it actually feels fresh throughout - I enjoyed seeing it play out, it's paced perfectly. There's a nice 'Breaking Bad' reference in there, too.An entertaining 2016 animated film, one that also has a positive message. Recommended."

Got it? Good now put all that amazingness into one single movie add to that cute anthro animals and BOOM you got yourself a Zootopia. This movie is the greatest Disney movie of all time. Also this movie was the one single movie that managed to get a genuine shock out of me with the plot twist, also it has a lot of great humour and the best I repeat the BEST animation E V E R! So shut up all yo haterz about ""the twist villain being obvious"" and ""the bad sound track"" the villain was really good and the song was a banger and I could not get it out of my head for a long time and I was ok with it. So all in all if I could put a 20/10 review then I would do that because Zootopia THE BEST MOVIE EVER THAT CANNOT BE BEATEN (except maybe Zootopia 2) IT IS PITCH PERFECT IN EVERY SINGLE WAY SHAPE OR FORM AND IS ALSO THE GREATEST CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE EVER MADE, PERIOD!!!"
" Not as good as Toy Story
",-0.3412,-0.5637,2020-07-11 00:00:00,5,I didn't finish watching this. It was too long & didn't hold my interest. It wasn't as good as the Despicable Me's or the Toy Story movies. The story is about a female rabbit that wants to be a cop in a world where only big preditory animals are cops. She finally passes the tests & becomes a cop but is only allowed to be a metermaid because of her small size & inexperience. She begs to be a detective. The chief says if she can solve the missing persons case in 48 hours she can move up in rank. So the movie is about her trying to solve a missing persons case.

It was very well coordinated considering the large sum of writters and producers.

This age-old metaphor has a simple scientific origin. On the one hand, Darwin revealed the significance of evolution for human beings; On the other hand, there is a close connection between animality and humanity. Take the two main characters in the film for example. The two cultural sayings, ""If a child is quiet, if a rabbit is moved"" and ""fox takes the tiger's power"", easily emerge in everyone's mind, forming the first impression of Judy Rabbit and Nick Fox in the audience's mind: the former is lively and kind, while the latter is cunning and sophisticated. In fact, from the beginning, the film takes advantage of, or at least obeys, the stereotype, portraying both as exactly what the audience expects. But when you watch the entire film, you realize you've already fallen into the creators' mind-set -- zootopia is about an anti-bias utopian story."

" Every piece fits the puzzle
",0.0,0.9974,2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,"Yes it's a children's movie. But that's the beauty of Zootopia or any Pixar movie as a matter of fact. It never fails to capture the true essence of life that can be easily enjoyed by both young and old. These intricately designed movies, tailored to fit everyone's interests, are architecture-d with perfection which is clearly evidently from each and every frame.
Zootopia is set in a world where predators and prey live in harmony. Judy is a small town rabbit and falls in the latter category naturally. She has big ambitions of being a police officer in the big city of Zootopia. The movie navigates through all the trials and tribulations she faces on her journey after going to Zootopia and having achieved her dream.
Judy is one of us- overzealous having fulfilled her lifelong dream despite the ridicules she received from everyone around her and quickly disheartened
after the reality sets in. It's not all sunshine and rainbows. This is what sets Judy apart from the rest of us. She doesn't forgo what she believes in even when the world says otherwise. Ultimately, she proves herself right.
The characters are likable and add to the quirk of the movie. The sidekicks were as well thought as the main characters.
Every scene in the movie has a role to play and has been crafted seamlessly to fit in the bigger picture like every piece fits the puzzle.
The details are mind-blowing and is the product of sheer hard work put into it. Words fall short to describe the wonderful animation Pixar tirelessly serves to its viewers on and on.
The storytelling is commendable which certainly adds to the viewing experience.
As a whole it's one of those feel good movies that urges you to continue to hope despite the challenges- a clichéd life lesson given by many but adopted by none. Yet the makers have articulated the movie in such a way that you wouldn't mind sitting through this 2 hours movie to experience Pixar's unique story telling style and beautifully crafted world of Zootopia."

I wish that they would have done more to address systemic oppression rather than just individual stereotypes, but it was intended to be a conversation starter (as opposed to the entire conversation). Certainly a movie that is worth re-watching and discussing."
" Warm dream, healing plot
",0.4404,0.9948,2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"There is poverty and misfortune in the world that cannot be chosen, but the dream that can be chosen with all one's strength.
Martin Luther King had a dream that all people should be equal and free.
Judy rabbit police officer also has a dream to make all animals have equal freedom and make the world a better place.
After the gorgeous 3D effect, most of the animals are cute and powerful, which I can't remember. The ears that Judy raised when he struggled for his dream again and again are always in front of my heart.
In other people's eyes, a young stage play is just a fantasy bubble. In Judy's heart, the seeds of true dreams are rooting and sprouting. The dream is on the other side of the road. The road to realization is so long. The traffic police who are full of expectation are frustrated and frustrated sometimes. However, the fun of pursuing dream always occupies the majority of the journey. On tiptoe, with 200 tickets, Judy is one step closer to his dream; with the help of kindness, a magnified figure, he and her destiny follow; around time, over difficulties, and finally, all animals gather in one city. Dream or fairy tale. What I like is this warm healing feeling. I love this rabbit. I love her dream.
The stage extends as far as the heart goes.
Judy's unintentional loss in the interview not only lost her friend Nick, but also made animal city fall into unprecedented chaos. She went back to her hometown and began to sell carrots in frustration. Nick, who was full of expectation after taking the oath, was muzzled, ridiculed and beaten by other animals. He became an untrustworthy fox in other people's mouth: a peddler who evaded taxes and cheated, since Everyone thinks foxes are not trustworthy. Why should I change them? You see, they've been hurt, and they've broken their heads in the way of dreams. But what's so terrible about this? Judy never forgot the dream of police officers. Nick always had a good heart, so they finally punished the evil and promoted the good, and saved the peace of animal city. What's terrible is the first heart, the first dream, that disappeared in the passage of time.
So old-fashioned, so warm."

Although the ending is happy ending, as Judy said, the real world is complex, messy,loud. there are all kinds of differences in the cointries, in any video comment area, there are people arguing and quarrelling, we are very good at expressing their views, and increasingly unwilling to seek common ground while reserving differences. Because all kinds of problems are divided and opposed, they are problems that the whole world is facing."

In the eyes of children, this movie can bring them different visual effects, such as cute animals, prosperous big cities, green forests, white glaciers, and inspirational little white rabbits. In the eyes of adults, the film reflects more moral. Having dreams, customer service difficulties, building friendship, eliminating racial discrimination and respecting others are the basic principles of life, and also the road to success.

" Favorite Disney Movie Ever
",0.4588,0.9856,2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"The ideals represented in Zootopia are more relevant to the real world than any other Disney movie I've seen. There are the more obvious principles of social justice on full display here, such as the themes of diversity and tolerance for others-obviously embodied by the primary duo of the film being ""natural"" enemies: a fox and a rabbit. What sets Zootopia apart though is how well it treats the issues and how the themes apply not only to issues of racial bias, but to all forms of intolerance of any number of personal traits. The themes of inclusion extend to all groups or persons who might feel othered for any reason.Zootopia also features strong themes of believing in yourself and in others. Of breaking out of the mould of what the world tells you are your limits or how high you should aim. Or even the value of having any notion of reaching after your aspirations at all, instead of settling for the familiar well-worn path of your parents and those around you. The idea of daring to tread the unpaved road.From a cinematic perspective, the characters are great and the world is both beautiful and intriguing. Ample amount of humor too."

This is one of those times in both cases. This movie is phenomenal! The animation is stellar! The plot is very unique. It's essentially a social commentary that only looks like an animated talking animal/buddy cop movie. And it's pulled off amazingly! The jokes in this movie are hilarious and very original! There were even a few unexpectedly dark scenes where I jumped. This is one of the best animated Disney movies ever made! It's right up there with Big Hero 6 and Wreck-it Ralph. (Sorry, Frozen. You were just ok.) It's incredibly charming, and I feel like Pixar could have made this. This is definitely going to be a day 1 purchase when it hits Bluray.

" More mature than the classical Disney picture
",0.4754,0.9922,2020-03-29 00:00:00,8,"""Zootopia"" is a great animated film. The animation by itself is very well done and the overall design is very inspired. It's not the most original but it was executed better than the major part of the other movies with anthropomorphic animals. But ""Zootopia"" is more than just mere animation because it has a solid plot and a powerful message. Indeed it is a sort of detective story (keep in mind that at the end of the day is a movie also for children and so is not cerebral or over complicated) that brings the protagonists to found a bigger dangerous plan. This plot is full of good messages to convey to children but even to the adults. ""Zootopia"" is indeed about believing in yourself but most importantly racism, that is treated in a powerful way for kids (even for adults but it's clear there are more mature movies). On the other hand the film is also funny, colourful and energetic.
In conclusion I liked Zootopia a lot and I think that everyone can like it too, even those who usually don't watch animated movies.Ps: Nick the fox is simply too cool!"

" Zootopia
",0.0,0.9998,2020-02-05 00:00:00,8,"I know that Zootopia is so last year, but I've just watched it recently even though my sister has already watched it since last year. She did tell me so many times of how good Zootopia is, but I haven't really thought of watching it until recently. And yes, I have to agree with my sister-and apparently nearly everyone-that Zootopia is indeed a good film. Well, I guess I should never expect less from Disney. As always, Disney managed to deliver a good film with a good story and lots of moral lessons.At first, I was pretty confused to who are actually the main characters because the poster is so crowded with many characters. I have to be told by my sister which characters are the main characters in the film. Anyway, aside for the oh-so-crowded poster, you'll know at once who are the main characters once the film is started. And since the beginning, I already know that Zootopia would be a film with great moral lessons. Why? Because since the beginning, they already gave great motivations to the audiences, such as never give up and never feel you're different just because you're different. I think it's a great advice especially if the audiences are mainly children.""Life's a little bit messy. We all make mistakes. No matter what type of animal you are, change starts with you."" - Judy HoppsAt first, I thought the main problem is how Judy Hopps fits in the police force because she is the first bunny that has passed as a police officer. The other police officers are usually predator animals or larger animals such as cheetah, lion, bear, or buffalo. Like many other problems in the world, as an outsider, Judy became an outcast. Everyone seems to underestimate her just because she is small and not as scary as other police officers. Much to everyone dismays, Judy is forced to enter the police force and became one of the police officers. She is first assigned to do parking duty by Chief Bogo, who doubted her potential because Judy is just a rabbit. Even though Chief Bogo seemed to be underestimating Judy a lot, there are times that I think he teaches a few thing or two. Like knowing your own limit. Having many dreams are awesome, but there are times that you should restrain yourself and know your limit. Sometimes, knowing what you are capable of is much better than having some improbable dreams.""It's not about how badly you WANT something. It's about what you are capable of!"" - Chief BogoOf course, the story doesn't stop there because, like any other good films, there would be obstacles along Judy's way to become a recognised police officer. She finally got her first major case even though Chief Bogo didn't believe that Judy would be able to solve it. With the help of a con artist Fox, Nick Wilde, Judy tried her best to solved the mysterious case of missing predators. And she has to meet many problematic along her investigations, including running away, betrayal, and so on.Although Judy Hopps is the first main character in Zootopia, I prefer Nick Wilde who at first appear to be a con artist but actually a good and loyal friend. He accompanied Judy to solve the mysterious case of the missing predators, even though at first his motivation to help Judy is by force. However, as the story goes by, Nick Wilde proved to be a good friend and taught Judy and the audiences so much. Judy is more stubborn, while Nick is more chill and funny. That's why I like Nick's character better than Judy's. Not only Judy, we get to see Nick's background story too. Although not as much as Judy, at least we know why Nick is like the way he is now and that what kind of person-or animal-he actually is. Just because he is a fox, doesn't mean he is bad. He proved to be very useful and very clever as well. In the end, he helped Judy a lot even though he seemed to be untrustworthy at first. The teamwork between Judy and Nick is good and unusual but they are very much entertaining the audiences. Nick may be a fox, but unlike other predators, he is small. That's why he often being underestimated by others and often not being trusted by others too because he is a fox. From Nick, we can also learn that just because people said we are what we are, doesn't mean we have to listen. We can be so much more. I really like Nick's character. Now I understand why my sister like him too.Nick may be a fox, but unlike other predators, he is small. That's why he often being underestimated by other predators and often not being trusted by other animals who are not predators because he is a fox. Since the stereotype of a fox is cunning, it's not surprising that the non-predators will assume he is untrustworthy. From Nick, we can also learn that just because people said we are what we are, doesn't mean we have to listen. We can be so much more. Nick is a proof that even though he is a fox, he is not as cunning as what others think and he can actually be good and trustworthy. I really like Nick's character, the development of his character throughout the film. Although Judy's character has also become more mature throughout the film, I still prefer Nick's. Now I understand why my sister like him too.Nick Wilde: I learned two things that day: one, that I was never going to let anyone see that they got to me.
Judy Hopps: And... two?
Nick Wilde: That if the world's only going to see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy, there's no point in being anything else.
Judy Hopps: Nick, you are so much more than that.There are quite a few times when Nick Wilde made me laugh. Judy is more of a serious type, while Nick is more of a relax type of person-or in this case, animal. Including when he introduced Judy to his friend, Flash, a sloth who worked at DMV (Department of Mammal Vehicles). That scene was so funny that I have to laugh out loud even though I watched it twice. Flash is super slow, like a film set in a slow motion and even slower than that, making Judy felt frustrated because she needed to get things done faster. Seriously, Flash is hilariously even when the way he laughed will make you definitely laugh too!""I thought this city would be a perfect place where everyone got along and anyone could be anything. Turns out, life's a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy. We all have limitations. We all make mistakes. Which means, hey, glass half full, we all have a lot in common. And the more we try to understand one another, the more exceptional each of us will be. But we have to try. So no matter what kind of person you are, I implore you: Try. Try to make the world a better place. Look inside yourself and recognize that change starts with you."" - Judy HoppsAside from Nick Wilde, another character that I like in Zootopia is Benjamin Clawhauser. He is a fat cheetah, working as the receptionist in the Police Department. Clawhauser proved that being a cheetah is not forever scary. In Zootopia, a cheetah can become very very cute and apparently very fat too. I wish I could see him more in the film, but whenever he was on screen, I managed to put a smile on my face. He is super cute!I guess it's no wonder that Zootopia won the Best Animated Feature Film of the Year in 89th Academy Awards. With so many moral lessons you can learn from the film and a good story along the way, Zootopia really worth the Oscar. I do hope Moana (2016) won the Oscar at that time, but after seeing Zootopia, I guess this film deserved more than Moana. I should never expect less from Disney after all. The animation from Zootopia is also amazing, although not as breathtaking as in Moana, but I like the details of the city. I have no idea that they found the idea of making two different cities in one Zootopia. One place for larger animals like bunny, cheetah, lion, and so on, and other place is for the mice. It's cute and clever.I also like the fact that the soundtrack really supported the film. Try Everything by Shakira really is the perfect song for Zootopia. The lyrics really suited well to the plot story of Zootopia, making the song is not only fun to hear but a motivation itself. I have to praise all the production team of Zootopia because they surely made a great film. Other songs also well put and made things more entertaining and spot on.All in all, Zootopia is a fun family film with so many moral lessons that will be good for audiences, not only children but adults too. I expect nothing less from Disney in terms of this. Zootopia indeed has a very good plot story, with some jokes put in it. Thus making this film is very entertaining after all."

" Zootopia & Adressing Stereotypes
",0.0,0.9969,2020-01-24 00:00:00,10,"Ever wonder what a world without stereotypes would be like? In the movie Zootopia, directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore, and Jared Bush, the animated film has a purpose that sends a sweet, positive, and eye opening message to all watching about stereotypes. In fact, research shows that children have definite stereotypes on certain genders, ethnicities, and other social groups by age five, according to The Jane Group.
In the animated film, it all starts with a small bunny named Judy Hopps, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, and her desire and push to be anything she wants to be. Determined to make the world a better place, Judy takes off to the city of Zootopia after graduating first in her police academy class to be the first of her diminutive species to serve alongside larger animals like rhinos, elephants, etc. First assigned a parking ticket job then to finding a missing otter, Judy needed major help and found her person. To help her, she blackmailed a savvy fox named Nick Wilde that she caught committing all kinds of crimes with taxes and misdemeanors. Due to their mischievous appearance and perceived breaking the law ways, foxes are universally distrusted in Zootopia. Nick, voiced by Jason Bateman, helped out a ton throughout the adventures in each part of Zootopia, such as the tundra, rainforest, desert, etc.
Another Judy cheerleader in this film was Officer Clawhauser, voiced by Nate Torrence. Officer Clawhauser was a great example of stereotypes in this movie, as he would originally be percieved as an obese, effeminate cheetah who's obsessed with donuts and a singing superstar called Gazelle (voiced by Shakira). That wasn't the only stereotype based off of Officer Clawhauser though. While we are not sure, many percieved Officer Clawhauser  or a predator in the film that simply embodies the kind of fat-queen stereotype, and there is nothing wrong with that.
Not only were many stereotypes made off of being a certain type of animal listed and appearance, but stereotypes were also created over the way they acted and viewed situations. Judy Hopps, for example, would not only be judged on her size (the fact that she was a bunny), but also because of her perky attitude and extra determined self. Sadly, stereotypes affect many of us everyday in reality. We try to be ourselves, but come off as oddballs, and I believe this film sends a good message that it is okay to be different and stand out in times others wouldn't. Our world these days tends to circle around trying to blend in and ""act normal"", but I believe that we all tend to forget the pressure we put on ourselves to feel accepted, when we are in control of that perception.
Overall, I believe the movie Zootopia sends a kind message to be accepting of everyone and don't judge others, all while keeping children entertained. With an upbeat soundtrack full of energy and suspense, I believe this PG movie was very successful in targeting all age groups entertainment, and it shows through the successful ratings and how high they grossed from this movie (around 1 billion). Hopefully someday everyone will acknowledge the kind messages emphasized in animated movies, like the animated movie Frozen and the message of possessing love within, and push for a stereotype free world too!"
" Zootopia is not out of reach - but don't assume too much...
",-0.0096,0.9973,2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"""You probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny 'cute,' but when other animals do it, it's a little..."" inappropriate? condescending? presumptuous? This is now the privilege of insider vs. outsider is transformed from the real world into the animated world of Judy Hopps as she experiences prejudice and ""species profiling"" in a society where everyone is supposed to be beyond that.In Zootopia, enlightened predators and prey live harmoniously and safely. They recognized the animal instincts that were keeping them in the pre-stone-age, and have evolved socially into a perfect world. Animals still retain all of the funny, quirky, and (forgive me) cute qualities that we in the real world have come to love and expect. This is where many of the sight and personality gags come from that propel the viewer in to understanding and even accepting the premise. These animals may be woke, but they still do the darndest things. However, the society of this animal kingdom is a utopia of equality and acceptance. Or so they say.Unlike a live action film where acting, lighting, camera work, and sets create the visual experience, in an animated movie, every pixel of every frame requires composition and creation. The production work on this movie rises to the highest standards available to date. Consider the panoramic wide angle shots of the lead character travelling from her small farming community to the big city. From phenomenal camera angles to extensive detail in the natural surfaces of fur, leaves, sand and snow, to the masterfully generated emotional detail on the face of a bunny, this scene astounds the viewer with a super-reality that makes fantastical sense.The 9-person writing staff led by Byron Howard begins with the standard police procedural (with Idiris Elba voicing the hard-boiled Chief Bogo), adds the typical ""unlikely"" character (in this case a bunny cop voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), includes the villain with a heart of gold (Jason Bateman as the fox, Nick Wilde), and then mixes it all up with the deep seated distrust of ""the other"" to show the audience that it takes a lot more than government regulation for us all to just get along.A viewer might argue that the movie depends upon the audience buying into the very stereotypes that are being decried. You are expected to ""get"" that the mayor with his condescending attitude and thirst for power is best represented by a lion; that the police chief with his arrogant indifference to other perspectives or individual potential is best represented by a stoically arrogant water buffalo; that the slower than slow government workers at the Department of Motor Vehicles are literally giant sloths; that a new age health spa stoner is best represented by a llama (instead of a koala?). But it is only when we are lulled into acknowledging the simple fact that there is more than ""just a hint of truth to animal stereotypes"" that the most surprising plot twists can have their strongest effects.We have all seen saccharine animated films where the ant saves the colony, or the bully toy learns to play nice, or the bee starts a labor union (or something like that). This animated feature does not insult our intelligence, but it doesn't preach either. It takes a real world issue that has life for death implications and amplifies it to the degree that it is impossible to ignore, then reveals how it is really much more complicated than we simple humans really understand.For some good fun at the expense of our animal friends, some thoughtful experimentation into social criticism, and some incredible visual production, you can't do much better than Zootopia."
" Big time winner!
",0.6239,0.9895,2020-01-20 00:00:00,9,"When it was released in 2016, this film was quickly praised as the best animated effort of the year. Winning the Oscar was therefore no surprise. The film really has everything going for it, from an excellent opening and closing title song, ""Try Everything,"" written by Sia Furler and performed by Shakira, to a well written script, and a host of outstanding jokes.The song, written exclusively for the film, ended up being an international smash, earning double platinum status.There are simply so many excellent scenes, many full of belly laughs, but the stealer was the scene at the DMV, which by itself put this movie over the top.Perhaps the best achievement though was in presenting a really nice message about inclusion, and being yourself, without harming the story or getting preachy. It's a rare combination for one movie to hit everything in harmony, from laughs, to production to inspiring message, but Zootopia managed to pull it off spectacularly."

The first time I watched it, it just annoyed me but I thought I'd give it a second chance, try and see what people love here. Still don't see it.On the upside, the animation is pretty. The voice acting is solid. There are even one or two moments of laughter.That's it though. The rest of this movie still falls apart to me. It feels too predictable and by the numbers. There's a message about equality which is nice but there's no subtlety to it, instead it gets hammered over your head again and again and again. There's no surprise here and I never feel invested in the characters or world. It's fun but not real deep.Maybe the most annoying thing to me is that I want to like this world and these characters and I just don't. It feels too much like Disney trying to jump on the equality bandwagon which, to me, ends up feeling empty, hollow and fake.Again, I know I'm the minority here and would still absolutely encourage people to check it out and form their own opinions."

" Best Disney film since the Renaissance
",0.6369,0.9603,2019-12-28 00:00:00,9,"With social commentary, charming characters, stunning animation, and an intriguing setting, Zootopia cements itself as the best animated film since the Disney Renaissance, and one of the best overall films of the decade.First, let me talk about the characters. Zootopia features characters with pleasing character design and delightful and nuanced personalities. Nick Wilde is one of my favorite film characters with his confident yet sweet nature. Judy Hopps also provides a fine protagonist, being upbeat but without any annoying stereotypes.The animation detail is amazing, especially on characters, the fur looks perfect, and the backgrounds look great too. The message against discrimination provides a stark contrast to Disney's other animated films which don't have such a mature message. The only problem I have with Zootopia is its villain - Deputy Mayor Bellwether. Though the plot otherwise was fine, her motive is not adequately explored, and her villainy seems to simply be an addition to the recent Disney twist villain trope. Also, Mayor Lionheart's role in the matter confused me.Nevertheless, Zootopia's exceptionally strong characters, message, and animation far outweigh its cons."
" Surprisingly Good!
",0.6588,0.9993,2019-12-25 00:00:00,7,"Zootopia is the latest Disney animated film from their own animation studio. From seeing the advertising for the film I had no ambition to see this movie in the slightest. However, after seeing the positive reviews and the praise the film has been getting from people I decided to give it a look finally. I have to say this is probably the most mature animated film from Disney since the Incredibles, which is saying a great deal.Now, I thought I was in trouble with this film at the very beginning. Honestly, the first fifteen to twenty minutes is my biggest grip with the movie. You have Hopps dreaming of being a police officer and everyone else putting her down saying it's impossible, even her own parents, and she has to prove her worth. It's a theme that's been done to death in movies, especially kids movies. It's not even especially bad in its execution, but it's just very heavy-handed and formulaic.Fortunately, once we get past those first twenty minutes and we get into the mystery angle of the movie it gets much better. The mystery angle is easily the pest part of this film. The whole ""don't judge a book by its cover"" theme is still present but I think it's handled in a much better way. It even goes to a place that I did not expect a film like this to go. Though, they do kind of go back on it by the end I was still amazed they went there at all.The second best thing is the characters. I really do like the two leads, Hopps and Wild. Wild is my favorite character definitely. The side characters are also a lot of fun.The animation is on-point, as well as the voice acting. Every voice fit their respective character perfectly. The action is also quite well-done and engaging. I also loved the artwork, especially of the city itself. The humor is also quite good. There were some jokes that were typical but most hit. There was this one scene where they straight-up parodied The Godfather and it was hilarious. It was the funniest thing in the entire flick.I also loved the design of Zootopia and its various sectors it has. The colors are so vibrant and the animation is great. From that to the people and their interactions with each other really brings this city alive and makes it feel like a real city.Overall, Zootopia is the best animated film from Disney since Frozen. It has a great cast of characters, a great mystery, great action, great art and animation, and a good portrayal of its many themes, adult themes, even if it felt fisted at times. I think this definitely a great film for the entire family."

",0.4678,0.9963,2019-12-03 00:00:00,7,"This Disney movie interested me when I first saw the previews way back when, but never got around to seeing it. Then I got my wife Disney+ as a Christmas gift and saw that it was on their streaming service so we gave it a watch. It was cute and mildly amusing; however, I found that it could have been a bit more funny as the crime began to overshadow the humor a bit in this one. What I mean is, figuring out what was causing the animals to go mad was the more interesting portion of the film rather than the fact we have a bunny cop and wise cracking fox trying to figure it out.The story has a bunny whose dream it is, to be a cop in Zootopia. She ends up becoming the first bunny police officer and she is basically given the job of meter maid, much to the delight of her parents who are scared to death for their little girl. She soon though gets wrapped up in a case involving a missing otter and must enlist the help of a con artist fox to find out where the missing otter is.The movie is more funny during the first part than the last third. The voice acting is good as was the animation. The areas of Zootopia really popped as you had snowy zones and a rain forest. The best part of the film, though, to me was the sloth run DMV which so accurately depicts how it is inside the real department of motor vehicles! I also like the mob boss who was really into icing people!So, in the end, this Disney film was pretty good. It is nice to have a Disney animation that does not have songs and such within like the police chief alluded to. The film seems to have been a very huge success so I am sure the inevitable sequel will be coming, but unlike some films, this one warrants one as you can have many misadventures for two officers on the job!"

I've always admired Disney and their unlimited imaginations that go beyond time and space. But I have to say that Zootopia is my favorite Disney film that they have created. What's genius about this movie is that they take an exact replica of our society and transform it into an anthropomorphic city called Zootopia where everybody lives in perfect harmony. And like our society where we deal with issues like racism, sexism, and other topics, they take those issues and pack it into Zootopia, while at the same time keeping it entertaining for adults and children. I also want to give the screenwriters credit for working as a team while the first half of them creating a controversial topics, while keeping it clean, while the other half on taking classic works like Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes and putting it into Zootopia. I was so impressed with this film that I wanted to watch it again because i wanted to soak up Zootopia and see how every animal fits their job that they work at.

Surprisingly, it was much more than that, Zootopia is one of the best animated films I have seen! It's enjoyable and the plot is really unpredictable. I really impressed and appreciated by the main character Judy Hopps. Although she faced numerous difficulties and not supported by her friends, she kept trying her best and finished her dream. I give Zootopia an A for its well-written characters and memorable scenes. If you are Disney's fans, please do not hesitate to watch! The journey of mystery and family love awaits at your nearest cinema!"
" An absolute gem
",0.0,0.7579,2019-09-13 00:00:00,9,"This movie is an absolute gem. Them having chosen a city with all different type of animals allowed them to depict each animal with it's respective, let us say, stereotype. And that was marvellously done.Also, it's off the walls funny with some inside jokes as well for adults. If you know what i mean."

" My Review!
",0.0,0.9585,2019-08-29 00:00:00,8,"A pretty interesting take on the animal kingdom. The detail to every animal type of how they might be, if they started living like humans is just worthy of an applaud. One does not require animal behaviour knowledge to understand. A movie well made for both kids and adults. My review might be going technical for an animated movie. ;P So, go watch. It won't be a waste of time, I guarantee that.Peace Out!"

",0.3802,0.9478,2019-08-18 00:00:00,9,"The title of the movie that i love is zoootopia and the genre of this movie is animation. This movie is about judy, a small and smart bunny and Nick, a clever and kind fox.
For 108 minutes, this movie shows the interesting story about a series of missing animals that has happened in zootopia.
This movie was released three years ago, but sometimes i still watch it .
l like the scene that Gideon Grey who bullying her in childhoood apologize Judy.
Because his action was a sign of fair world in my opinion.
I highly recommend this movie to people with prejudice.
After watching this movie, i think people should respect each other even if thwy are different.
So l want to give zootopia full score. Watch this movie! You will never regret!"

" I love this animation movie with all of the talking animals!!!
",0.7249,0.973,2019-06-15 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my favorite movies because it doesn't have any humans in it. Just the talking animals. One of my favorite characters is Nick.

While Nick likes to be a comedian and wonders around the city, Judy runs over to Nick to ask for help, so he decided to join her in solving the missing mammal case. It doesn't matter about whether this is a bad movie because I believe this is a perfect movie for animal lovers."

The only thing that was going for it was the voice actors and maybe comedy, but the sloth joke was in the trailers. I remembered movies like lion king for furries so I watched it. Ok umm how? I just the voice actors, cinematography, editing, surprisingly plot. I don't have many problems, I wish the sound mixing was better but this was fantastic."
" Utterly disappointed

" Best movie EVER
",0.6369,0.9697,2019-05-27 00:00:00,9,"Zootopia is a very funny film, with a very well done animation, captivating and very charismatic main characters, a great story and a fast and pleasant rhythm, and besides all this, it is one of the best animations of Disney and one of the best animations ever made"
" Creative and ingenious
",0.4404,0.9767,2019-05-25 00:00:00,9,"This's a movie you can watch over and over without getting tired of. The message's unique, the animation and setting's cool, and the characters are likable. The story's about a rabbit named Judy Hops who's aspiring to be a cop. In order to achieve her dream she moves to Zootopia where she finds being a cop isn't always glamorous but eventually she gets better at her job and slowly earns the respect of her colleagues.Things get complicated when a sly fox comes into the picture and if that's not enough a conspiracy's been going on where someone's trying to turn the public against the predators as part of a political move. Hops needs all the help she can get to bring this conspiracy down once and for all. The message is very interesting in that it doesn't just racism and side is bad but instead shows the effect on both sides and how politicians use it to benefit their goals. That's very interesting.The characters are likable and the world they live in is amazing. The way the city is set up to accommodate the various animals is cool. There's a scene where Hops chases a weasel in a area for rodents and it's not only funny but creative. There's not much else to say other than check this song out."
" Best Disney Movie of the Decade
",0.6369,0.9634,2019-05-24 00:00:00,9,"It is becoming more and more apparent that Walt Disney Animation Studios no longer holds the monopoly on animation like it did in the past. While they ruled the world of animation for decades, especially in the 90s, they are now constantly competing with Pixar, DreamWorks, Illumination, and others to deliver on animated films. Still, Disney has been quite successful in this decade. Zootopia is quite possibly their best movie of the 2010s, so far. Zootopia, unlike some of the other recent Disney movies, prominently features a core message, which in this case is one regarding discrimination. It's about Judy Hops, a bunny who strives to become the first bunny cop, much to the dismay of her family and many of Zootopia's inhabitants. Eventually she comes across a large conspiracy that affects all of the city. Judy is a good character because she's strong willed and determined, and the audience sees all of her struggles, and shows all of the ups and downs of her plight. She's joined by Nick Wilde, a fox (who in this world are like minorities) who is at different points a friend and enemy of Judy. Either way, he's a fun character to watch because he can handle himself in any situation. The message is conveyed well because it isn't preachy, it isn't blatantly stated, and it's given through well-written and relatable characters.The animation is on par with Disney's reputation as the best animation studio in the world. Everything, from the designs of the animals, to the detail on their fur, to all the different environments of Zootopia, is animated spectacularly. We'd expect no less from Disney. With the environments, the creativity is out in full force. You have the city, which is designed to accommodate each individual animal, you have jungles, tundras, and all these different places where different animals originate from.The mystery aspect is also handled quite well, in that it keeps both kids and adults interested, and it takes Judy and Nick on an adventure through the world of Zootopia. It also takes us to the underworld of Zootopia, showing us some of the crime of the city as well. Without giving away the joke, there's a hilarious scene that parodies The Godfather, which is probably the best scene in the movie.If there's one thing to complain about, it's the ending. Disney really, really, really needs to stop with the twist villain trend. It worked in Frozen, it worked in Coco, but it doesn't work here. There's no reason for Bellwether to turn out to be a villain like that. And since they do it so often, it's not a matter of ""are they going to do it again"" it's ""who is it going to turn out to be."" This movie didn't need a villain at all. The prejudices held by some of the people of Zootopia are enough of a villain, it isn't necessary to include an innocent looking sheep who's actually a criminal mastermind drug lord.Zootopia is an excellent addition to Disney's lineup, and even their best movie of the 2010s, delivering strong characters, an incredibly creative world, an interesting storyline, and top-notch animation. This is a must-watch for families and enthusiasts of animation."
" Fun Family film with a Powerful Message
",0.7269,0.4638,2019-05-18 00:00:00,9,"Super cute and fun movie for the whole family to enjoy! The urban setting with the multiple Burroughs is unlike anything Disney has done before! The characters are sweet and likeable but a little bit predictable.
This entire film has a very obvious theme of anti-racism and I think this is one of the most creative and interesting ways to tell that story. Everything from the setting to the characters contributes to this real life comparison of racism and honestly it works soooo well! I don't even mind that the entire film felt slightly too present day with the iphones and technology, because the way this film is set up, is that it is telling a story of racism present day. Give this a few decades and it will go down as a classic guaranteed!
My biggest complaint with this film is the villain at the end. There was no sign or anything that bellwether would be the villain. It felt lazily thrown in at last minute to give an evil mastermind behind the work. Her intentions line up, but still feel a little weak since honestly any prey animal could say that those were their intentions. Why not line it up with something to do with her job as assistant mayor? That would have been interesting.
This was an exceptionally good film overall and I recommend it to anyone!"
" Zootopia : The Inspiring Movie
",0.4215,0.9954,2019-05-13 00:00:00,10,"Zootopia is a 3D animation movie produced by Walt Disney. Zootopia is a big city over there. Like its name, this city contains all animal characters such a zoo as well. We can find so many animal characters here and of course they bring their own characteristics. They are rabbits, foxes, goats, sheeps, wolfs, lion, sheep, rhinoceros, and any others. And the main character is a bunny or we know it as a rabbit called Judy Hopps. Ya, just a little rabbit who has wanted to be a policewoman since she was child while there was no rabbit be police. There is no matter if the citizen are just rabbits, but the problem is the citizen are not only rabbits but all of animals are over there. There are many big and strong animals such rhinoceros or lions who are more appropriate to be police than just a bunny. She had been underestimated by every one for dreaming to be police, even by her parents. But it was not a problem for her, even she must pass many difficulties, she just kept trying and trying and finally she got appreciation to be the best police since she could finish a mission of a case and found something new on it.1. Animation
The animation moving is very smooth such as another 3D animation movie. The characters are drawn well, suit to their characteristic. We can know directly how is a character's feature even just see them, not watch them. It run a same way when some characters turn characteristic, from good to bad or vice versa, we can know it directly by their expression. It eases children to know how feature of the characters are, so they won't be confused by watching this movie especially when some characters change their appanage. This movie has a beautiful color, contras but still in harmony and it makes gazer, from children to adult, be able to enjoy this movie well.
2. Score
For me, every single sound in this movie is nice, very nice. From the dubbing, sound effect, and of course the sound track. The sound track, Try Everything by Shakira, is very representative that movie and it suits when it played while Judy Hopps was enjoying her journey from her hometown to Zootopia. So, we, as gazer, can enjoy both of picture and the song.
3. Plot twist
This is the most unexpected part of this movie when Mrs. Bellwether changed into a bad character. In the beginning, she was very good and helpful to Judy, but it turned out that she was a mastermind of all of ""disaster"" in the movie. This part gives us some breaks when we have a bit been bored think who is the mastermind of the problem.
4. Moral Value
Same as its soundtrack, this movie reminds us not to give up on everything, just keep trying and trying, trying everything and making something new. Life is all about problems, problems always come and leave. One problem has been solved and another problem will come to us, of course, that's a life. And for facing our problem, just ignore people say for braking our dream, just keep trying and prove that we can do for reaching our dream. And don't be afraid to fall on our journey, believe in ourselves that we can, we can, and we can.
This movie was very impressive to me when I watched in 2016, I was in senior high school. I had a dream that it was very difficult for me at that time. It made me doubt that I could reach my dream. By watching this movie, I cried and created an advice for my own, ""Believe in yourself that you can reach what you want as long as you want to try more, more and more, nothing impossible in this world."" Moreover, the plot twist reminds us for not to ease believing someone and not to judge a book by its cover.For me, this movie has almost no lack. This film is very recommended for watching by everyone, from children to adult, even elderly, because of its own picture and its value. For children who haven't been able to understand the value, they can enjoy the beautiful picture, the cute characters and moments, and of course the song. And for another, they can remind themselves by value of this movi"

",0.0,0.9886,2019-05-11 00:00:00,10,"It was full of dream and hope. Additionaly, it contained a serious theme. People often say 'you won't lose anything by giving it a try.' I wonder if this word is for this movie because I didn't find negative facter. Or rather, it was full of positive emotion all over! Personally speaking, it is one of the best Disney movie.All characters are cute and the world view is enjoyable. The funniest character is folivora, Flash. He almost made me hyperventilated because of laughing so hard. That was the bomb!Although I usually watch movies dobbed in Japanese, I prefer the subtitle about this. The best thing is feeling more immersed at the closing!"
" One of my absolute favorites
",0.4215,0.9774,2019-05-09 00:00:00,10,"Zootopia is a really fantastic film that couldn't have been released at a more fitting time than 2016, when Donald Trump was elected President and stroke fear in the hearts of American citizens in order to gain votes. The film's message about prejudice and how fear should not divide us is great and pretty damn ballsy for Disney to do.
The animation is very beautiful and the world-building of Zootopia is meticulously well though-out. The designs of the characters and the landscapes are absolutely incredible!
Both of the main characters Nick and Judy have such a good chemistry and they are two characters I heavily relate to and adore. Judy is very optimistic and wants to make the world a better place. Nick had faced prejudice for who he is and has hardened as a result. The both of them work together to solve a case of predator animals suddenly turning savage and learn more about each other on their journey, thus forming a friendship between each other. Nick and Judy are so well developed as characters and I love their camaraderie! The rest of the cast are memorable and lovable, especially Clawhauser! ^w^
The plot twist villain Ms Bellwether may be a little underwhelming, but I think she works because of the film's message about prejudice.
Overall, Zootopia is a fantastic film and definitely one of Disney's best. 10/10"
" Personally thought it was ok
",0.296,0.2953,2019-05-05 00:00:00,6,"I felt like they kind of really over-emphasized the whole putting you down and get back up and prove yourself again. The other side characters weren't that good, maybe aside from the singing gazelle. The humor was ok and quite a bit of plot holes. A mediocre movie for me but probably because it was geared more towards children."

It sends a very strong message of not giving up on your dreams, and not to allow bullying to get you down.This was a great mystery adventure, with action and suspense. I enjoyed the characters, especially the jackal Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman). The film became more and more interesting as it progressed. Wow, this was actually rather exciting!"
" An entertaining and adventurous experience for the young ones and an empowering and relevant message for the more mature ones.
",0.8122,0.9884,2019-05-02 00:00:00,8,"""A little bit of kindness goes a long way"" would be a perfect quote for this film.When Judy Hopps, a country rabbit, shoots for her dreams as a part of the police force in Zootopia(Zootropolis), things weren't what she expected it to be. She was forced to face reality for what it truly was. Sound familiar?It may have delivered a couple of messages that people have already heard dozens of times, but that doesn't take away the strength it gives to those who believe that what matters the most is trying to do things right in their lives and in society. I wasn't expecting to find this to be a source of encouragement and inspiration, but that's what it delivered. The ""true"" conflict presented was also as relevant as it was when this film was released. A divide that caused unrest among the ones that should be working towards improving society.One small crutch from the plot was its use of circumstance to move the story along. But overall, this can be overlooked since after all, it isn't only with wits or pure strength alone that would allow a person to find solutions to the problems that they face in their lives.Using cartoons as a medium to convey the kind of messages it did was also a brilliant move on the part of the producer and creators of this film. It would be a good and effective learning material for parents or older people to use to teach young people as a way to prepare and make them understand how the world works.Brilliant movie."

Take away the animation, the striking visuals and the Disney magic ... and you're still left with a very good story. I like movies like this.

But what else would you expect from the denizens of Bubbletopia who constructed this propaganda from their glass studios? Teaching not to stereotype WHILE stereotyping?? I guess some groups aren't vocal enough to be protected. Can't have it both ways, Disney. Furthermore, this cartoon afterschool special has the morality of a criminal defense lawyer: the reason why people are bad is because other people were bad to them first. Right. In the next installment of this fluff, why not have the fat cheetah come all the way out? Force that uncomfortable car ride home on the unwitting parents who want to raise their own kids the way they see fit. P.S. Practice what you preach, Bubbletopia. Welcome the so-called predators in your tightly secured, not-so-diverse enclave and see if they want to sing Kumbaya witcha. And no, the sloths were not funny."

On the website, we could wishlist what we wanted to watch, so we wanted to watch Zootopia.

And yes, somehow it really works. This movie is so smart and creative as it addresses issues such as diversity and gender stereotypes in such an engaging way. So many animations these days are purely just dumb moments that will keep a child quiet for 90 minutes. Although Zootopia is equally engaging for both adults and children due to how well written it is. Something that is over looked is just how incredibly hard it is to write a great screenplay for an animation. And zootopia absolutely nailed it, including everything from a smart story to moments which are hilarious for everybody. This movie would have surprised a lot of people, myself included, so therefore I give it a 9."
" Zootropolis Review
",0.0,0.8897,2019-03-23 00:00:00,8,"In the mammal city of Zootropolis, rabbit rookie cop Judy Hopps (Goodwin) is forced to team up with fox Nick Wilde (Bateman) when civilised animals start turning savage.
On the face of it, Zootropolis sees Walt Disney Animation Studios on safe ground. This is the Disney of Robin Hood and Mickey Mouse - cute, anthropomorphised animals, walking on hind legs, talking up cosy platitudes. A familiar formula ready to delight pre-teens and be packaged for enthusiastic toy merchandisers.
But Zootropolis has more in common with Pixar than it first appears. The fictional universe it presents - a human-free world where mammals have evolved into a bustling, civilised society - is vividly realised, richly detailed and very funny.Our guide through this world is Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny cop in a buddy-cop movie, paired with a mismatched partner - a fox. Hopps is very much a Disney heroine for a post-Frozen world - peppy and independently minded. Despite the urges of her carrot-farming parents to give up her dreams, she becomes Zootropolis' first rabbit police officer. Her partner, Nick Wilde, is a wily hustler played with sarcastic relish by Jason Bateman. In the wild, they're enemies; here they form an uneasy partnership as they're both assigned to a missing-animals case.
In the grand tradition of the genre, the mismatched pair gradually learn to get along. What they uncover - a this-goes-all-the way-to-the-top conspiracy - raises questions over what it means to evolve past your biology; in a city where former bestial foes share an uncomfortable truce, it serves as a smart analogy for the debates on immigration that rage in our human world. It's not a domain into which you often see Disney venture.Of course, political metaphors will bypass the youngsters and yet the twisty machinations of the noir-lite story sometimes get lost among the furry shenanigans. This means, for adults, the joy is often to be found in the background: beavers as construction workers; sloths working the desks at the Department Of Motor Vehicles; Shakira as a gazelle. But it remains entertaining throughout - a testament to the inventiveness of the on-screen action. And Pixar's influence."

It has some very adult themes and very real topics that it explores.I will say that it has some dark moments that could possibly scare younger kids, but the adults will appreciate them. It's just nice to have a kids/teenager movie that isn't constantly song after song about something, plus Jason Bateman is just a powerhouse even when he's animated.This is a movie that I will watch over and over again.

It seemed from the start that it was just going to be a straightforward and well-written mystery, but it emerged as a fascinating allegory for racial tensions, tokenism and corruption in government. I felt this was explored quite brilliantly.What also helped the narrative work so well was the dynamic between the two main characters in Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, voiced superbly by Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman respectively. How their friendship develops was engaging and provided for some hilarious, and also sincere, moments.The animation was also fantastic, immersing you into the world completely.In the end, it's another great Disney animated film."

" Fun comedy thriller
",0.7351,0.9758,2018-12-05 00:00:00,10,"Zootopia is both a comedy and a thriller - and a children's animated film. For a children's film, it deals with surprisingly serious topics, as it doubles as a social parody (and NO, it ISN'T left-wing - THANKFULLY). Judy Hopps is a cute bunny (who'll get annoyed if you call her that) who manages to secure her dream job of becoming a police officer in the city of Zootopia - although she faces the challenge of a boss who holds old prejudices and simply isn't interested in a bunny as a cop. However, Judy soon finds herself on a missing mammal case with a very reluctant (and just a shade on the wrong side of the law) fox which has huge implications.The animation in this film is terrific - among the best I've ever seen (alongside Finding Dory). The voice acting is good. Ginnifer Goodwin is literally PERFECT as the voice of Judy. No-one else could have done it half as good. Jason Bateman is similarly perfect as the fox, Nick Wilde. I was unsure initially about the voices of a couple less important (but still important) characters, but now I can't imagine them with another voice. The movie is both exciting and funny and mysterious. In short, great!"

" My favorite Disney movie of all time.
",0.4588,0.9973,2018-11-25 00:00:00,10,"Five words: Best Disney movie ever made! Why you may ask? Because I love everything about the movie. I love the characters, the story, the animation, even the message about human races, or animal races I should say. When I saw the trailer, I thought it would just be another good movie by Disney, but boy was I wrong. It was fantastic! Amazing! Awesome! I just can't stop loving this movie! And I think the message is strong about treating each other equally, and we needed this message and I'm glad Disney made this movie about the message.And thanks to this movie, I read the good side of fan fiction. There's so many well written Zootopia fan fictions, some I just can't stop reading till the very end like a real book. But how did this movie got me into fan fiction? It's because of the ending where Nick said ""You know you love me."" and then Judy replied ""Do I know that? Yes, yes I do."" it maybe in a friendly way, but it's more than that in my opinion. As an inter myself, I think Judy & Nick would be a great Disney couple in the sequel, IF they make a sequel.If Disney doesn't make a sequel, than I'm going to be upset on Disney. Don't you agree."

" Zootropolis
",0.0,0.9941,2018-10-10 00:00:00,9,"This Disney animation, retitled 'Zootropolis' in Europe, is set in a world without people; instead it appears that all other mammals have evolved to live like people... and not eat each other. Our protagonist is Judy Hopp, a rabbit who has always dreamt of becoming a police officer despite the fact that a rabbit has never been in the police. She exceeds expectations and becomes the first rabbit to serve in the Zootropolis Police Department. She is disappointed to be given traffic duties rather than 'proper' police-work but then an otter comes to the station saying her husband is missing. Her boss isn't interested but she insists on taking the case... he says she can do it but if she doesn't solve it in forty eight hours she will have to quit. With no access to police resources she has only one lead. This takes her to Nick Wilde; a fox who is quick to work a scam... after a little blackmail he ends up her unlikely partner and the two learn that there is a darker truth behind the disappearance; a truth that could end the peaceful coexistence of predator and prey species in Zootropolis.This film was a lot of fun... far more so than I expected. It starts well with a play featuring a young Judy which explains how predators and prey used to interact in this world but now live in peace. We then see that not all live up to the ideal. After this prologue the story proper gets started; this nicely spoofs cop-shows before the mystery gets started. This proves to be a surprisingly good mystery which is likely to keep viewers, young and old alike, guessing. There are moments that could scare younger viewers but these rarely last too long and ultimately things are resolved in a way that shouldn't leave youngsters worried. Most of the funny moments are aimed at all ages but there are some references to things children probably won't have seen such as 'The Godfather' and Breaking Bad'. As one might expect from Disney the animation is of a very high standard and the voice cast does a really good job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd say this was a really fun film that can be enjoyed by all ages with the possible exception of very young children... if the opening scene doesn't bother them they should be okay."

" Try!
",0.0,0.9653,2018-07-11 00:00:00,10,"I actually watched this film a few years after the release of it. I was no longer big on Disney like I used to be when I was little in the first place, and I was not really a fan of Computer Graphic animation. However, my opinion about the animating style has changed after I watched this film. It is about a rabbit who solves problems as a corp with her friend for fox in a city called Zootopia. 
 Zootopia is a city where any kinds of animals can live together in peace. There might be a city or country modeled for creating the story. As for me, I thought of New York or Vancouver, where people with various background come together. However, people are not always happy when different ethnic groups meet. This is true in reality, and this is a problem that the protagonist, Judy, and her friend, Nick, face in the film. They go through the problem, they are also examined their friendship, and their trust in themselves. The story conveys the strong messages; trust your friend, and ""try everything"" you want to do because your possibility is unlimited unless you do it to yourself."

" Mildly entertaining... if you can turn you PC receiver off.
",0.0,0.9852,2018-06-04 00:00:00,6,"Five minutes into this movie, and I've already had a feeling I'm being brainwashed with a hose, and I simply wanted something easy and entertaining to watch...Okay, here we go. First of all, I really enjoy all this hypocrisy. I find it deliciously entertaining. We have a protagonist, who chose a very specific field of work, and it's not only about making the others obey the law and/ or authority. First of all things it requires a very strict obedience and subordination, AND our dumb fluffy hero thinks it works only one way. She's better than that, she shouldn't do her job because she knows better. *applauds* Cartman's 'Respect my authoritah!' line should be somewhere within this movie's logic.We have several absolutely Mary-Sue/ Deus ex Machina moments. The worst of them all is when protagonist's about to get fired, expectedly, but some random sheep saves her fluffy tail. Next time - Nick interferes with pretty much the same result. Seriously? It's between her and her superior, who's Nick? Is it a common practice out there for complete strangers to step in the job issues discussions and twist them the way they want? 
I dare you to moralize this. Refuse to do the assigned job, insist on special treatment right from the doorstep, think you're better than the tasks that have to be done by someone (not you, apparently), and there would certainly be a miracle saving you from ending up in a dumpster? Gimme a break! I'd certainly love a noir-esque twist Disney would probably implement for sure if it was several decades ago - ending up jobless, homeless, too stubborn to crawl back to the farm, despair deepens and forges the character. This would make this movie so better. Instead of this we are encouraged being irresponsible. Great morals out there, someone _else_ would always speak up to _your_ superior. No, kids, that's not what happens in life, it's your job, your superior, you deal with it, no tasks are below you, AND you're responsible.Next. We have the whole movie attacking our ears with cheesy lines against the prejudice based on *species*, but it turns out, it only is applicable to the protagonist (better than thou, right). All side characters are so stereotypical and one-dimensional based on their species I wonder if it's far beyond the 'racist' line.I must say, once the movie gets past the Mary-Sue part, it gets slightly better, I won't even spoil that. Too bad the better part is relatively short.Now, let me see what we got left after all this PC BS had been peeled off. Nowhere near classics, an okay-animation, nothing breathtaking, compared to some stuff released around 25 years ago, average plot and even more mediocre story development. Exaggerated grimaces, getting worse with every movie, but of course, how do people know 'emotions' if they aren't expressed in such distorted way? Painfully predictable and passing, which is certainly a waste of opportunity, since this setting could've been made a better place (ironic, huh?). If you can turn your brain PC receiver off, it's fine to watch once, without expecting much, otherwise - beware of Brainwashing Hose of Hypocrisy!"

And if nostalgia had nothing to say on that list, it would be on top!This is one of the few Disney movies which manages to master the fine balance between the most hilarious comedy and the darkest issues of reality. Nothing is thrown in just because it had to. It's a tale of a countryside bonnie who wants more out of life, she wants to persue that by going to the big city of Zootopia! She wants to be a cop, but everyone tells her that she hasn't got what's needed to become one simply because she is a rabbit. Beside that personal issue which has been seen a lot in recent Disney movies, there is a refreshing social comment on how society is full of prejudice, here exemplified by predator and prey. That is a brilliant metaphore! And there is no stone left unturned in the world of Zootopia! So much attention has been payed to details in every part of the city! Go watch it for yourself, otherwise I would spoil it! But such small things as how Judy Hopps shows her emotional state by how her ears are is one of the great details of the animation. She's a rabbit, get it?It will keep you at the edge of your seat, it will make laugh a lot, it will make you think about your own prejudice especially if you pay attention to our present times.

It doesn't follow the ""rules"" as we know them. It's fantastic, and should be seen by a much broader audience, including adults. Heck, I'd say a lot of what is going on here is actually aimed at the older audience. This movie has a lot to say about society and culture, and how anyone who dares to be different is treated. 
The animation itself is incredible. Super colorful, with many varied environments. CG animation has truly reached a point of super smooth perfection, and I can't see it getting much better than this.
The story makes this pretty unique over so many other CG animated movies. This is pretty much a detective story. A caper. Crimes are happening, and they need to be solved.

" Zootopia review.
",0.0,0.9422,2018-04-08 00:00:00,9,"What a wonderfully delightful movie. Some of the the best characters I've seen in a movie and so funny. The sloths are hilarious. Zootopia is going to smash the holiday box office open as it is intelligent and fun the whole way through. The big thing to consider for this movie is whether it is suitable for young children. I had already read some reviews that were saying 5 and 6 years olds may find some scenes scary. And that could be true. I didn't think the boo scenes were that startling, there is really only one jump moment in the whole thing that made everyone leap out of their seats. The part I found most intense was the language. It is not swearing but the characters are rather forceful with their words. If you are uncomfortable with characters aggressively scratching or pushing each other while they say things like ""you jerk, shut up"", then this movie may be too old for your child. The one thing I can say without reserve is that all adults should go see it. You will love it."
" A solid, good movie with a 'feel good' story.
",0.7506,0.9878,2018-04-04 00:00:00,7,"Summary: A good story that is well told. Great attention to detail and humour. The characters are well written and dare I say, 'realistically' portrayed. 
_____________________________________________________________________I would say the story by itself is not very groundbreaking, even if all the characters are anthropomorphic animals. However, this is very well told in an engaging manner with plenty of humour and not without some surprises. I really liked the attention to detail to the design of Zootopia and how all the different species are accommodated into the city. Pop-culture references were also funny. What I liked more was how the characters were portrayed - you can believe they are actual people(?) living their lives. I especially liked the scene where a character, after a rough day, hesitates to pick up the phone call from her parents, dreading the sheer exhaustion of putting on a happy face. That was quite relatable. Overall, for a movie intended for children, it certainly has plenty of entertainment value."

Her parents prefer that she stay on the farm in Bunny Burrow and make the world a better place by growing one carrot at a time. Judy obtains her wish and goes to Zootopia where the lion lies down with the lamb, both predator and prey live in harmony. In spite of 14 mammals being missing, Judy can't overcome the prejudice and stereotyping on the job and is assigned parking ticket duty. Here she meets a fox (Jason Bateman) someone she holds a stereotype and prejudice against. The overall theme of the film is diversity. Together they form an odd couple (i.e. typical film mismatched police officers) as they attempt to crack the case, one that takes them to a Godfather scene, one the adults can enjoy on a different level than the kids.There was a room where all the animals roam naked as they were intended (Bunny averts eyes of spread eagle elephant) and another scene which stereotype the DMV as sloths, reminding me of a scene from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide..."" These scenes while funny, went against the grain of the production.The major theme of the film is diversity, Even though some in a group are bad, it doesn't make everyone in that group bad, perhaps a light message about the current terrorist situation."

I knew NOTHING and I mean nothing about what this movie was going to be about! I stayed away from some trailers and I wanted to experience this movie myself and I was ABSOLUTELY touched by this movie! Zootopia is a fantastic film that has breath taking animation, AMAZING characters and a very clever story! I absolutely LOVE this movie! I love Judy Hoops and Nick Wilde who are both played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman! These are a great example of characters in animated movies! These two characters weren't your average Dreamworks movie characters, these characters were VERY well written and very mature! I also loved Idris Elba as Chief Bogo. His character was also very well written and mature. In fact, this entire movie brings great and mature messages for both kids and adults! Certain things that happen in Zootopia deal with everyday crimes, segregation and racism, even some signs of drug use in this film! Yeah and I mentioned that this was a Disney movie! Zootopia is not only a Disney film that kids can enjoy, the entire family will have a blast watching this movie and to be honest, adults might enjoy this film more than the kids! Zootopia surprised every single body part inside of me and this is definitely a film that will become a Disney masterpiece and a classic as time goes on and a film that EVERYONE can watch and have fun with and i'm gonna give Zootopia a 10/10!"

" One of pixar's best ever! (No spoilers)
",0.6696,0.9988,2018-02-09 00:00:00,10,"Zootopia tells the story of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde who are a bunny and a fox respectively who are trying to solve a case together. I am saying this is one of pixar's best is because it is bold enough to go where other pixar movies didn't go. From the movie start I was surprised by Judy which is such a loveable character and at the same time such an optimistic person that tries to be better and better even though she fails a lot of times just like Shakira's song says in both the beginning and end of this movie. The animation is the best ever from pixar and I've seen Coco which is newer than this but in Zootopia there were some scenes in which everything seemed real, really. The voice acting is fantastic and the standouts are these two leading characters, Idris Elba and JK Simmons' characters respectively. The story is so mature and so rich with countless moral lessons for both kids and adults but the thing I loved about it is that it gave so much depth to this two characters that at a point in the movie I thought I was watching a real movie about a police case. There are so many twist and exciting moments in this film where I was either laughing very hard or shocked or amazed by the courage this movie had with the story it told. I honestly don't have a single gripe or flaw with movie and that's why for me it's one of pixar's best along with 2017's Coco. Both will probably end up oscar winners and that along with the movie themselves just proves that sometimes animated movies can be better than real movies. Oh... did I mention the score? Fantastic again from Giacchino who is becoming a master at scoring these types of movies.Amazing animaton, great voice acting, engaging story and great music make this movie one of pixar's best and one of 2016's best movies. 10/10"

" The Best Movie Ever.
",0.6369,0.9528,2018-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Zootopia is a fun filled movie for its young viewers. There is an amazing message lying beneath the surface which is why this movie is so amazing. There are many jokes that are funny for people of all ages but the best part of all is what the movie teaches us. Zootopia was supposed to be this place where the predators and prey lived together in perfect harmony, they were equals, but everyone was blind to the discrimination that was still lingering around. Officer Judy Hopps thought that she discriminated against nobody until she pointed out the fact that only the predators were going savage due to their biology. This movie is very relatable to our society today. People want to believe that there is no discrimination going on but there is, it is everywhere. The first time Officer Hopps showed any type of discrimination is when she saw a fox she immediately reached for her fox spray. Many people when they see someone who looks ""dangerous"" immediately feel scared and that person could be the nicest person in the world but right away just because of how the person looks they are scared. The message is important in how it relates to people. It basically says that if we can finally put aside our differences then we can live in peace. There will be no more discrimination based on where you came from. This message is portrayed throughout the whole movie and another one that shows kids that it is okay to be different and to face adversity. Everyone told Judy that she would never be a police officer because she is a bunny but she followed her dreams and took everything that was thrown at her and became an officer. It goes to show that no matter what tries to hold you back always go for your dreams."

" Executed nicely; Political undertone obvious
",0.4404,0.8564,2017-11-27 00:00:00,7,"The characters complimented each other really well, the story line had me guessing, and there is comedy and entertainment for people of all ages. I would recommend this movie, but also advise that the political undertones are pretty evident, and analogies can be drawn easily to real life. But just like most political agendas, their is a lining of hypocrisy. While they support equal treatment to all animal species, there is a clear divide between the farming citizens and those living in Zootopia. The farming citizens have ""settled hard"" and did not follow their dreams or even believe in them. They are also perceived to be behind the times, still holding prejudices against animals of other species. The city of Zootopia is perceived to be the city of acceptance , knowledge, and overall advancement of the animal kingdom. While the main protagonist learns that prejudices still exist in Zootopia, in the end the animals of Zootopia learn that prejudice is bad and have a dance party together lead by the Gazelle pop-icon voiced by Shakira. For kids, I believe the undertones will go over their head. If not, it can spark a good conversation. However, the conversation should also include how those who choose to farm and not pursue dreams that others may have are in no way better or worse either. It should also be noted the bunny, who was (self-perceived) as less prejudice than others, was in fact more impatient with animals (the sloths in the DMV) than the fox was, while the fox is perceived to have accepted prejudices. Otherwise I thought it was very funny. To me, Michael Bateman's (the fox) deadpan, back-to-reality sense of humor helped balance the over enthusiastic persona of the bunny."

Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando ""Godfather"" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - ""I want to try even though I could fail..."". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message."

" Zootopia
",0.0,0.9928,2017-10-17 00:00:00,10,"A bustling metropolitan city filled with a diverse population of animals, both predator and prey, is the setting for Disney's 2016 film, Zootopia. The plot is centered around both Officer Judy Hopps, Zootopia's first bunny police officer whose sole wish is to protect the lives of all animals, and Nick Wilde, a con-artist fox with a narrow view of his future. Working together, the unlikely duo solves the case of 15 missing mammals. Zootopia, a 2016 film by Disney, is a must-watch for all ages because while it not only teaches children to dream big, but, behind cute and fuzzy animation, this multilayered film provides commentary about flaws in the American society.As a young child, everyone has a dream ranging from becoming a professional athlete to blasting off into space. While growing up in a small-town carrot farm, Judy Hopps dreams of becoming become a police officer despite being small in stature. Although Judy ultimately achieves her goal and becomes a prominent figure within the Zootopia Police Department, she faces many setbacks along the way to her success. Unlike many children's movies, Zootopia does not simply portray the common ""dream big"" theme but instead provides a more insightful angle applicable to reality: how to block out negative influences in order to achieve one's goal. For instance, Judy parent's, Stu and Bonnie, are constantly warning their daughter ""if you try anything new, you'll fail"" and not to ""believe in them dreams too much."" Despite the negative influences surrounding Judy, she refuses to let her dreams be crushed by the words of others. In today's reality, those who doubt the plausibility of a dream will never be able to achieve it. Judy serves as a positive role model for children and adults alike; even when she is hurt from Gideon Grey, a bully who mocks her dream, she refuses to lose her positive mindset and states ""I don't know when to quit."" Furthermore, in Zootopia's theme song, Try Everything, Disney does not attempt to hide the hardships reality will throw at those who attempt to achieve their dreams. Instead, in phrases such as, ""birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up,"" children are urged to persevere because with consistent effort, one shall conquer their fears and achieve greatness.Although Zootopia, with its cute, fuzzy visuals seems to be guided predominantly toward children, this 2016 Disney movie is multilayered and proves to also be an outstanding film for adults as it provides commentary on controversial topics and flaws within today's society. For instance, Zootopia's fictional world, where anyone can be anything and various different animals can, in theory, live together in harmony, parallels America, the land of promise in which anyone can rise up to great heights despite having an unfavorable background. Zootopia both commends and mocks the American Dream. For example, when Nick Wilde points out, ""life isn't some insipid dream where you and everything comes true,"" Judy Hopps realizes her naive conception of Zootopia's world is not as lavish as it is rumored to be. Her thought process is similar to the mindset of immigrants who come to America in hopes of riches, but unfortunately, they are only able to gloomily find treacherous low-wage work and an abundance of problems within their ""grand"" society. Though, on the other hand, Zootopia also commends the American Dream by creating the protagonist of Judy Hopps. Through hard work and consistent effort, Judy is able to rise to success and fulfill her dream of becoming a police officer despite her origins as a bunny from a small farm in the country.In addition to commentary about the American Dream, Zootopia highlights the presence of stereotypes within today's society. In the fictional world of Zootopia, differences between all animal species claim to be settled by the media, but, in reality, prejudice still continues to exist. Judy Hopps experiences discrimination first-hand because, unlike the majority of large, predator-type animals within the Zootopia Police Department, Judy is a little bunny. Due to her difference in stature, her boss stereotypes her as a weak, dumb, ""token"" bunny. Though, when Judy Hopps is barred from completing any real detective work despite her superior abilities, she does not tolerate the limitations placed upon her and instead works to prove herself by cracking the case of 15 missing mammals. After rising up against stereotypes, Judy Hopps realizes ""we all make mistakes"" and ""we all have a lot in common."" Through the protagonist, Zootopia urges both children and parents alike to disregard common stereotypes and to express one's true self.Ultimately, behind a seemingly childish plot, Zootopia provides valuable insight and proves to be an enjoyable film appealing to all ages. While maintaining the classic Disney theme encouraging children to dream big, Zootopia differs from most films by providing an aspect connecting cute animation to reality. Overall, Zootopia is definitely a film that will remain in the hearts of all."
" One of the Most Excellent Animation Movies
",0.6115,0.9941,2017-10-10 00:00:00,8,"This is a wonderful animation film that definitely surprised me! Expecting it to be another average Disney film, I was delighted to find it was not quite so. First of all, the animation is extremely well done which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. The amount of details is astonishing and watching it twice was not a punishment for me. The plot is also surprisingly well thought-of, being funny yet dramatic and it keeps you on your seat while also making you laugh multiple times. Although a city full of anthropomorphic animals that dress and act like humans has been extremely popular since animation existed, I believe this Disney movie takes it to a new level. It really does feel like everything took years to develop as the environment is complex and believable and the animal characters resemble their real-life counterparts remarkably well. It's amazing how they could produce a movie with simple jokes suitable for kids yet still silently addressing real-life issues at the same time. At last, I definitely recommend this movie for the whole family as I deem it enjoyable for all ages."

Much of the police force consists of the stereotypical big and strong animals. And here comes a little bunny, who is intelligent and crafty, who decides to join the force. Since she is small she is scoffed at and giving the task of meter-maid. She stumbles into something larger and important and the story gets even more exciting from then on. The simple storyline is even if you are small and viewed as less important, if you have courage, you can still have a large impact. One other 'parents storyline' is a satire on the political system and how it is corrupt. The animation is really good, the story is well edited and has many funny moments. The funniest parts are still the scenes from the trailers with the slow moving sloths."

The plot begins with Judy Hopps doing A play with her friends but after the play she saw A kid getting bullied by A Fox & Judy has the courage to stop him. & after all of that, Judy wants to be A cop. Well, she said that before she saw the bullying. After Judy grows up & want to be A cop. So she went to the city Zootopia to be A cop. She trained really hard to be A cop. She now become A cop & then she met A Fox named Nick & her parents warned her about foxes. Nick is more like A guy who makes other people pay there money on something & then sell it for them himself & his sidekick illegally. He also does A lot of illegal stuff. Until Judy & Nick have to find A weasel's husband that has been gone & for some reason the predators in Zootopia have been going savage. So Judy & Nick will have to figure out the cast. I'am not going to spoil the rest of it because they are some people that haven't seen the movie. The animation is good, the voice acting is good, the quality runs well, & everything else works well. But there is something wrong with Zootopia. The sick part of the fandom. Where they make rule 34 & other sick disgusting crap the fandom does. This is basically A movie for Furries.

It's the outwardly meek proponents of this who seek division for their own political ends. It's clever in it's ambivalence, it's great to just watch and be entertained."
" As amazing as Star vs. the Forces of Evil
",-0.1531,0.9854,2017-08-07 00:00:00,10,"Star vs. the Forces of Evil became my new favorite show in 2015, but Zootopia became my new favorite film in 2016. I don't know what to say. Everybody knows about its allegory to racism and its beautiful animation, so what else can I say? Well, I can say that Zootopia utilizes CGI animation (3D) as well as Star vs. the Forces of Evil utilizes traditional animation (2D). A special treat for all of the Star vs. the Forces of Evil fans is the fact that Nate Torrence, Alan Tudyk, Jenny Slate, and Maurice LaMarche are part of both supporting casts and play characters in Zootopia just as prominent as the characters in Star vs. the Forces of Evil's 1st season.Fans on the internet thought that both Star and Zootopia went so well together that they compared the sloths of Star's Quest Buy to Zootopia's Department of Mammal Vehicles. They even remade the iconic 2015 selfie promo of Nick and Judy with Marco and Star in 2016. Even though they both have the same supporting cast, I'm glad that Star vs. the Forces of Evil and Zootopia each have a different female and male lead voice actor unique to them. Star and Judy have a different female lead voice and Marco and Nick have a different male lead voice.I really particularly liked Zootopia's world-building and hope that Disney Channel gets to have a Zootopia series. I will try to create it for them with some good ideas for episodes and make sure that they can afford to carry the same lead voice actors and CGI animation from the film over to TV, which How To Train Your Dragon was able to do. If they can afford neither, it won't feel like the same world. If I help them afford both, it will most likely be just as big a success on Disney Channel as Star vs. the Forces of Evil is on Disney XD.Judy and Nick solving crimes together and traveling through different ecosystems of Zootopia will be like Star and Marco traveling through different dimensions. Maybe they will even meet each other in a 2-episode crossover between both shows with each show hosting 1 episode! I would like to see how Star and Marco look in Zootopia's animation and how Judy and Nick look in Star's animation...as long as the number of fingers they have doesn't change. Thumbs up if you want Zootopia: the series to happen!"

It takes place in a very good fictional universe, where anthropomorphic animals live in a big city metropolis and it's human society with animals. That's a very good concept and it doesn't disappoint. The world of the film is developed excellently with colorful characters, brilliant animation and lots of nice world-beating details. There's plenty of action, color, fun and charm for the kids, but a timely and relevant message, interesting political themes, emotional depth and many fabulous Easter eggs scattered throughout will keep the adults happy. This is a film the family can enjoy together and one which adults won't feel the need to sleep through. The voice acting is good as well and overall, this is a successful Disney work. It's probably on the same level as Frozen. The trouble is, it's just another Disney movie. I'll admit, I'm not a great fan of Disney animated films. They're repetitive, they're formulaic and they largely fail to take risks. This film does have political themes and no romance in sight, but don't forget it handles its themes with kiddy gloves and the same highly charming but un-artistic vibe many Disney movies do. But don't get me wrong, this is absolutely worth seeing even if it's not a ground-breaking Disney classic. 8/10"

They work so well together and it's beautiful to watch how they decided to follow completely different paths, even when their pasts are very similar. Both of them transmit such an important message of being whatever we dream of, not giving up and not showing your weak side. I had a blast watching this two fighting against crime and all of the stereotypes surrounding our world nowadays.It's really well animated with delightful details and with great supporting characters. Plus, some twists in the third act and a lot of funny scenes keep us entertained for the whole runtime. My only minor issue with this film are the constant exposition scenes throughout the movie, something I can understand since this is a movie mostly advertised for children, but it still bugged me a little bit, especially the opening scene.This movie is still awesome, it has great characters, a super interesting plot, some beautiful messages both for us and the kids, a really cool soundtrack by Michael Giacchino and two protagonists that are just amazing!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" A smart, heartwarming Disney animated flick
",0.7003,0.9683,2017-07-24 00:00:00,10,"It's smart, it's funny, it's gorgeous, it's heartwarming, and it got plenty of suspense too. No wonder it won that Oscar. Disney had a monstrous year in 2016, and its Disney Animation Studio was a big part of that (Zootopia and Moana). All of the characters in the movie are all fascinating, and the message of anti-racism and anti-stereotyping are well-told. Oh, and who doesn't love all those movie/TV shows references? Especially that hilarious Godfather-ish mobster part. In the end, it earned over a billion dollar. Those brass in Disney must be happy."
" The voice cast won it all
",0.5719,0.9169,2017-07-15 00:00:00,8,"Firstly,I liked this title because of the fantastic voice cast.Especially Chief Bogo's played by Idris Elba.The performance and the plot was great.The direction was fantastic.Although I cant relate the story to what happens in our ecosystem,it was understandable.The soundtrack was also great."
" One of Disney's most political movies I've ever seen.
",0.0,0.5499,2017-07-11 00:00:00,7,"Zootopia was another great Disney film, and the better of the few that they've made in the past decade. Yes, Disney and Pixar are two DIFFERENT entities. So to conclude, I decide to give Zootopia a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. The film had fantastic characters, animation, and adult (semi) references, but its lack of clarification on its exposition, and forced relationship issues just bogged down the movie a little too much, to the point where I felt the need to dock the movie for those issues. In the end Zootopia is one of Disney's most political movies I've ever seen, but the use of fluffy little animals still doesn't give it enough momentum to make a change in the real world. It does make for a good kids movie, though.Read more at theVade."
" Best Disney Cartoon Yet!
",0.6696,0.8819,2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"Like other reviewers here, I didn't expect this movie to be good, let alone exceptional. To me, this movie surpasses all previous movies from Disney. The impact it left on me after watching this movie is comparable to that of Finding Nemo. It's absolutely brilliantly scripted, animated, and extremely relevant to our current social issues. It's a great movie for kids, but even better for adults once you understand the underlying issues this movie wants to convey"
" Very bad movie
",-0.5849,-0.8543,2017-06-28 00:00:00,3,"I think this is another propaganda of liberalism and politics, in this movie they bring out matter that weak honest people can be so cruel that they can oppress bad people, like they want us to believe in real life (but it's not so). it is the shame that this movie is in 250 top list."
" Great Disney movie! I love it!
",0.8715,0.9976,2017-06-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie rocks! Zootopia is a great movie and it's my 3rd favorite movie of 2016. The characters are amazing, the animation is well done, the music is great, and I loved Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps the awesome and cute bunny. Jason Bateman did a great job as Nick Wilde the cool and funny fox. I want to see more of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde in future Zootopia projects. I hope a sequel will be made in the future and maybe a TV series. The movie won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and it deserves a sequel! Zootopia would also deserve to become a franchise! I love this movie so much. I would also like to say, Bonnie Hunt did an awesome job as Bonnie Hopps, Judy's Mom. Bonnie Hunt is one of my favorite actresses of all time and I think Bonnie Hopps is cute just like Judy Hopps. Also, Judy also has a nice apartment room in the movie. I really want to see more of that in future Zootopia projects. If there are some of you guys out there who have not seen this movie yet, Where have you been? You're missing out on awesome movies! Go watch Zootopia if you haven't yet. You will not be disappointed. Thanks for reading my review on Zootopia."
" A funny, entertaining, heartfelt, and immersive movie with great characters
",0.9246,0.993,2017-06-22 00:00:00,10,"""Zootopia"" is the best animated movie of the year 2016 because the animation was terrific,the acting was mesmerizing and the plot was impressively perfect.A cute and smart rabbit Judy Hopps is so ambitious and intelligent.She wants to become a police officer. No bunnies ever before became police officers in the animal world of Zootopia because they are not strong enough. But Judy doesn't care what other people and animals think about her . She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is small and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer.She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for her,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already committed a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to avoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding the missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends and because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she cleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to refrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this yummy bunny Judy.Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular cinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and stunning acting. ---Yidioo"

" ""Exciting, light-humoured action in a Spectacular Kingdom""
",0.0,0.9985,2017-05-30 00:00:00,9,"Zootopia film review ""Enticing, exciting, adventure and action in a spectacular virtual world"" (9/10)Setting the scene From the word go the visually stimulating Kingdom and characters allowed me to quickly settle into the storyline. The costume and likeness to real relationships especially father- daughter were light-hearted and heart warming. Following the character introduction, action adventure was quickly eased into with help from the music. Defying convention was a quickly woven-in feature of the film with the main characters choices quickly going against the norm. This really acted as a great hook for future endeavours. Main body The storyline was simple and clear. The plot was complex enough however to not unveil too much too early keeping me guessing throughout the film. In parts, the mood was a little predictable yet small flourishes of light-hearted humour, with great effects in the well created virtual world, kept me well entertained. The music continued well and the tempo of the film was fast enough for an enjoyable action, yet not confused by rushing for effect. The balance between happiness and turmoil was just right, avoiding an excessive bout of isolated trouble that some childish films typically suffer from. This made the film enjoyable for family yet not just accessible for all. The variety in the characters, their mode of speech and personality was great and helped transport me into their lives. They each had roles in fictional society and well created costumes to match these. A few well known actors were also involved in assisting their portrayal. Scene changes were dynamic and frequent to assist the films good tempo providing stimulation for the viewer. Relationships were dealt with nicely with only a hint of possible future romance. This was good since it helped the movie tone Remain in keeping with the action genre distracting the viewer or plot goal. Music The music was up-beat with a strong tempo and was great for the start of any happy adventure. Shakira Try everything seemed like a great choice ... As the story unfolded, the music was adjusted accordingly and appeared to fit in well with most of the scenes. The subtlety of the music in darker times made it less memorable yet left the effects no less effective. Ending The ending was quite appropriate for an unpredictable action film. The resolution to the plot issues was not expected and therefore highly entertaining. Summary Overall a clear story with entertaining plot quirks. It has great potential to produce a sequel. It was seriously difficult to find fault with since the created world and characters shouted as much diversity as the dynamic scene and setting locations with their stories. The film captured my imagination, transported me to another world, intellectually stimulated me with light humour and kept me thoroughly entertained with an interesting plot and storyline. Close resemblance in theme likeness to other action films appeared to show perhaps, a slight oversight in creativity. The lack of memorable music for sadder or darker scenes were my only other criticisms."
" Not bad

The story itself was quite good though there was I felt some slight holes in the way things have turned out in turns of how society works altogether. This was minor to me however wouldn't mind if there was a bit more explaining. Overall not a bad film."
" Mind-blowing cast of crazy characters
",-0.34,0.9925,2017-05-26 00:00:00,9,"I really loved this movie. Just when I thought I'd be tired of animation features this technical masterpiece appears and I'm lost in fantasy. The way the animals move in such quirky anthropomorphic ways is not just funny but impressive as artistic achievement goes too. The bunny heroine is cool but almost outshone by so many funny rogues. There's just this great mix of contemporary cultural references, very mild adult humour, plain amusing creatures like the ranks of hamster office workers, and a positive moral message. I almost forgot the music which is fresh and uplifting - with Shakira appearing as I think a llama with a blond quiff anyway with all this in the ingredients the plot seems a little eclipsed by the sheer zaniness of the animation and design. Every frame is packed with action. A kaleidoscopic triumph!"

Story was well written, granted, it had a few flaws here and there but then again, nothing is perfect. Movie was pretty darn funny, too. And I liked the relationship between Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, albeit it being sort of cliché. I enjoyed it nonetheless. If you have the time you should go see this movie because I personally believe it's worth watching."
" So far, the best animated Disney film of this decade
",0.6666,-0.8609,2017-05-09 00:00:00,9,"Zootopia (2016) is quite a surprise: a Disney movie which tackles modern social strife head on. Zootopia is about prejudice and bigotry, reflecting how people are othered by their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, social background, etc. in the real world, even in a post-civil rights world. Both main characters suffer from prejudice in that they are victims and perpetrators. Nick Wilde is seen as a thug by nature due to his species, but he looks down on Judy for her size and her social background as a farmer from the country. Judy is seen as weak and foolish for those previously mentioned things; she claims to be ""enlightened,"" but even she has to struggle with preconceived notions about ""predators."" Many times, movies about prejudice ignore how EVERYONE has stereotypical ideas about people, how bigotry can exist even in people who don't burn crosses or hold up nasty signs about who God allegedly hates on the side of the road. Most people have bigotry that is subtle and these can be easily manipulated by fear-mongers, which is what happens in this film. The movie asks us to look at ourselves and question our perceptions of those who are different from us.Of course, Zootopia is also a fun film, an exciting mystery-comedy that is re-watchable indeed. The voice actors are excellent in their roles and the animation is top of the line, as is usual for most Disney projects. It is ultimately optimistic about the possibility of respect and understanding overcoming fear of the unknown and the other, and it calls us to do what we can to hold fast to these qualities in our own lives. And that is a fine achievement."

It doesn't feel forced, it doesn't feel over the top. It hits the palate well.Jason Bateman has my kind of humor. It's that type of humor that relies more on delivery, rather than what is actually said. Though actually, everyone involved was pretty good playing their part, I do feel that the show was stolen by Bateman and Elba.The script was terrific, performances - no complaints there, direction and animation was crisp and the story, though somewhat obvious at times, did a pretty exemplary job at being, smart.I can definitely understand why Zootopia is acclaimed, and why it was such a smash hit.

While the movie is considered to have a hidden message, it's not actually hidden. The whole notion of being a good person (to paraphrase the director Byron Howard) is spelt out clearly throughout the film. In some ways, Ginnifer Goodwin (who plays Judy Hopps) fails to understand this in some decidedly arrogant and sexist remarks she has made during Interviews. This is a shame because Judy realises she is part of the problem whereas Ginnifer fails to realise she is part of the problem. Byron Howard (the director) also made Tangled, a similarly beautiful story. Both stories resonate with fairness and decency. They are fast becoming odd-balls in a Hollywood that is expressing far more intolerance (such as the works from the female writer of Moana / Smurfs 3). Not only is Zootopia great in its own right, it shames the competition we are seeing from Hollywood. Definitely worth a rewind."

" Anthropomorphic animals occasionally amuse but Zootopia descends into a quagmire of political correctness
",0.1787,-0.9978,2017-04-03 00:00:00,5,"Having recently seen Pixar's entertaining computer animated comedy-drama Finding Dory, I was expecting something comparable from Disney with Zootopia. Unlike ""Dory,"" which features a mixture of anthropomorphized fish characters playing off against humans, Zootopia features a world completely populated by non-human mammals (as well as some rodents thrown in to boot). The world of Zootopia posits the cessation of hostilities between the 10% of ""predators"" versus 90% prey in the animal kingdom. However, that doesn't prevent the existence of prejudice among the creatures of Zootopia. The protagonist, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny from rural Bunnyburrow seeks to become the first bunny police officer. After ending up #1 in her class at the Police Academy, she becomes the first bunny officer in urban Zootropolis, a sprawling metropolis which features various ethnic neighborhoods such as Rodentia (a miniature city populated strictly by rodents), reflecting the ethnic diversity in human metropolitan centers.When Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a surly, by- the-book ram with a British accent, assigns Judy to humiliating duty as a meter maid, we realize that the discriminatory treatment she endures is a metaphor for misogyny and prejudice against women in the workplace. The appearance of the con-artist fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman)--as well as an earlier duplicitous fox character with a southern accent, Gideon Grey, back in Bunnyburrow--suggests that foxes appear to live up to their stereotyped reputations as manipulators and swindlers. Later on, Nick saves Judy and gives up a life of crime to become the first fox officer in Zootropolis. We learn that he initially went bad because of the prejudice he endured as a kid (the idea of an oppressed fox adopting the personality of his oppressor- -i.e. a criminal--doesn't seem like a far-fetched conceit at all).While the Zootopia scenarists keep us guessing (and occasionally laughing a little bit) as to how the various denizens of Zootopia mimic human behavior, the bulk of the plot is more reminiscent of a film noir. Take away all the animals and replace them with real human characters and all that remains is a rather standard detective noir. In this case, Judy and Nick are the ""detectives"" who have 48 hours to find a Mr. Otterton--one of 10 predator mammals who have mysteriously disappeared from Zootropolis—or else Judy will be forced to hand in her resignation to boss Bogo.Judy and Nick's travails occasionally land them in some occasionally amusing worlds including a DMV office populated by extremely lugubrious sloths (the joke however, goes on for a little too long). Then there's ""Mr. Big,"" who appears to be a takeoff on Marlon Brando as the Godfather. The twist is that he's a rodent and sits on the tiniest of thrones.Rather than humor, Zootopia is more interested in social commentary as Judy and Nick finally find the missing predators who have been imprisoned at an asylum by the city's mayor, a lion bent on protecting the public from the predators who have reverted to a ""savage"" state.Nick splits with Judy after she suggests at a news conference that there might be a ""biological cause"" for the predators' extreme aggressive behavior. Somehow her suggestion is interpreted the wrong way—biology becomes heredity in the eyes of animals like Nick, who represent the 10% of predators subject to discrimination. Zootopia takes on an even more heavy-handed turn when we learn that the predators have been injected with darts containing a serum made from toxic flowers. This turns out to be the ""biological"" cause Judy alluded to earlier which accounts for the crazed behavior of the ""predators."" Behind all this is a ""Prey Supremacist"" movement—led by the newly minted mayor, Bellwhether, a sheep who was only recently the Assistant Mayor.Could it be the 10%-- the ""predators""--are a metaphor for minority populations, subject to racism and discrimination? And the prey supremacists is just another code word for ""white supremacy""? All well and good but there's still one little problem here—those who engage in criminal activities (such as Nick the Fox), blame their immoral behavior on being victims of prejudice in childhood. Is that a valid excuse for immoral conduct? It seems that ""personal responsibility"" is a value that the film's scenarists are ignoring here. Again the idea of the oppressed becoming the oppressors is a valid one, but Zootopia doesn't exactly deal with it in a completely honest way. Here the foxes are simply wily con men, with their chief (Nick), becoming completely reformed and willing to work within the system (Nick again is the first fox policeman). But what of those who choose to seek a life of violent crime? Where are these characters in the Zootopia universe? Only the ""Prey Supremacists"" are guilty of extreme, nefarious conduct. The Predators (foxes), however, are practically benign—with the idea that most will go straight like Nick and Judy's reformed childhood bully (the fox, Gideon Grey).Zootopia unfortunately is an exercise in political correctness. While pointing out that prejudice is a bad thing (which of course is a very good idea)--the suggestion that the victims of such prejudice won't usually end up prejudiced themselves, is an example of wishful thinking. No one ethnic group should be held up as a paragon of moral superiority simply because they were victims of discrimination in the past."
" Wow, what a wonderful movie provided with moral lessons for all ages
",0.8176,0.6597,2017-04-01 00:00:00,10,"So, this movie called Zootopia, it has animals playing in a human-like world, where every species is symbolize a different human race.So you got this rabbit named Judy Hopps, who wanted to be a police officer since she was very little. When she is first assigned she first is assigned to parking duty, but ditches to arrest a crook. Something important that crook holds plays a major part in driving the plot.Major rampants of animals are going berserk yet Judy fails and resigns until her childhood bully on her family farm told her what those were made of. Other than that, shall I not spoil it for you.The songs are amazing the plot is well written, it's much better than Frozen.Some moral lessons to learn are that don't judge someone because of their species/race. While of course that problem may never ever be eliminated, we can try our best to reduce it and that is what Disney tried to incorporate a big major problem in the world today, racism.Another symbol is the plant ""night howlers"". Why this is a symbol is because the night howlers are the driving for the main antagonist to shine.Of course there are more symbols, but I should not tell you them, for you must find them yourself.While this movie doesn't reveal the antagonist until later, much like Frozen, it still performed quite well in theatres. At a 150M budget, it played to make Disney more than 1B worldwide, well done Disney.10/10"
" Lovely movie with cute animals and amazing animation
",0.891,0.9452,2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,"Not surprisingly, another animated film is among the best I watched recently. The anthropomorphic animals of Zootopia are among the most lovable creatures ever created.Main character Judy Hopps is the first bunny cop in town and she is not taken seriously by her colleagues. In Zootopia predator and prey live side by side, but they tend to stick to their ""natural"" inclinations, therefore most cops are big and aggressive animals. They resent bunny Judy and give her a hard time.Judy get acquainted with grifter fox Nick, then starts working on a missing person case. Nick is blackmailed into helping her and the two develop a friendship.The animation is just astonishing, with amazing details, such as the busy Zootopia main station where different animals get different treats according to their size (giraffes and mice can cohabit, but with precautions).The plot is funny, with plenty of little jokes but also a serious message of tolerance. I would have given it a 10, but I do not agree completely with the naive message that ""anybody can do anything"" and ""biology is irrelevant"". Overcoming prejudice is just as important as understanding and accepting that there are limits to what each individual can do - while still trying to to do our best. Otherwise we fall back into super-hero territory."
" PC cliché, flat story, low on humor

Sloths and the Tommy Chong wildebeest perhaps.Some decent action scenes.Overall impression was ""This needs to be a lot funnier, and a lot less ham-fisted with its cliché social justice message (that actually makes no sense because there are real biological differences between animals)"""
" Animated movie with powerful social message
",0.4215,0.9904,2017-03-25 00:00:00,9,"Zootopia is a great example of an animated movie that has something to offer for all ages. The crisp animation combined with witty social commentary makes it an enjoyable watch. The plot is simple; a rabbit named Judy Hopps is the first of her kind to become a police officer and faces many social challenges on her path to success. I will spare the details, but her journey involves a detailed crime investigation in tandem with a sly fox. The story is not entirely predictable and moves at a decent pace to keep the viewer engaged. I like that the movie encompasses various movie genres, which is characteristic of an excellent animated movie. Music is average, but can safely be overlooked.The most impressive parts are the commentary on various social issues as well as the small details that are paid close attention to. The characteristics of each animal was clearly studied well, and there were no logical discontinuities with the facts. It makes the viewer think a little and confirm that each animal's features are indeed sensible. The film stays grounded in realism and this sets the perfect tone for delivering social messages pertaining to classism. This could have easily been cliché if the movie deviated from logic too much, but the right balance was achieved by Zootopia."
" Much deeper than expected
",0.0,-0.9728,2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"Disney aren't generally my favorite animation movies. I find DreamWorks funnier (with the exception of Cars and Toy Story) and Ghibli studio more clever. However Zootopia clearly is within my favorites of all times. Why?First of all, it's funny. It's funny for adults laughing at some moments and it's funny for small children laughing at others. There isn't particularly scary scene as some Disney titles may have (thinking about Snow White) so it's watchable with small children.It's well paced, constantly entertaining. Characters are very well thought and the story... Oh boy/girl. It is so clever.It's not only very cleverly designed, but it is oh so actual... In the current social psychosis we, in the occidental world, are currently living with ISIS and co, this movie perfectly slams current ideas and speeches we are earring from our politicians. And just for that, it needs to be seen.SPOILERS FROM HEREThe movie actually is an investigation from a Police Rabbit (a prey) that needs to find why some predators (like Tigers, Bears, Pumas and so on) have disappeared. It is important knowing that Predators do not attack Preys in Zootopia, the city in which the movie takes place.In Zootopia, 95% of the people are Preys (rabbits, cows, sheep, elephants and so on), 5% are Predators.Within those 5%, a bunch of them have become mad and attacked other animals.Those ones who attacked other animals are secretly put in a remote jail, no one knows where they are, where they are hidden and where doctors are trying to understand what is going on.They did so because they have been injected a poison by the Personal Assistant (a sheep) of the Mayor (a Lion).Her objective (of the sheep) is to randomly turn Predators in killers so that she can install a psychoses of fear in Zootopia so that every Predator is being kicked out of Zootopia and finally small and insignificant Preys, find glory again. But this, the Sheep does it only for personal glory since she was small and overshadowed by a giant charismatic Lion.So you see that some innocent children Predators are losing their fathers, families are torn, other predators are seen as pariahs and so on.The Rabbit finally discover the plot of the Sheep and everyone can still live in harmony without fearing each other.Rings a bell? Copy paste what I written in World. Find and Replace: -""Prey"" by ""American"" or ""European"", do that for plural equally -then replace ""Predator"" by ""Muslim"", do that for plural equally -then ""Sheep"" by ""D.Trump"" or ""Marine Le Pen"" or ""Geert Wilders"" or even by ""a Populist politician"".Add equally ""Guantanamo"" to the remote jail.And by magic, all Zootopia movie actually will look like the current situation in Europe and America where a bunch of persons (Trump and Co) are using what a bunch of people (terrorist) did to cast fear upon the entire population and use an entire minority of people (muslims) as being monsters that need to get deported, or killed or of which children can die in the sea or in the camps...You get where I'm going...I'm taking one Star out because I wished Disney had some more balls to go deeper inside the theme of ""how much such stupid behavior can destroy innocent children's life"". It is only seen once when the Fox went to the Scouts and has been beaten by other just because he is a Predator and others were Prey, just because he was a bit different than the Majority.I really wished they went deeper..."
" Zootopia is no Utopia
",-0.296,0.9936,2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Having seen this film multiple times since first seeing it in theaters last year, I have to say that this is honestly one of the most satisfying films to come from Disney in a long time, not to mention one of the most relevant to the real world. While it does take place in a fictional world populated solely by anthropomorphic animals instead of humans, it's quite clear from the very first scene, that many of the societal issues that plague our world are paralleled, quite cleverly I might add, in the world of Zootopia, regardless of whether it's some ""carrot choke podunk"" like Judy Hopp's hometown of Bunnyburrow or the supposedly progressive, cosmopolitan, city of Zootopia where everyone gets along and discrimination is virtually nonexistent.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is an adorable little bunny from Bunnyburrow who has big dreams of being the first rabbit police officer in the city of Zootopia, however her more traditional-minded parents aren't strongly supportive of her ambitions, feeling she would be much better off being a carrot farmer, which I suppose, is the traditional occupation of rabbits in the small rural community in which they live. However, once growing up, she ultimately decides to go for it anyway, and moves to Zootopia to become a police cadet, ultimately succeeding in proving both her parents and society in general wrong, and becoming a full-fledged officer of the ZPD (Zootopia Police Department). However, she still has many obstacles to overcome, as most of the cops in Zootopia, quite believably, are both male and predators, leaving her a small, female ""prey"" animal, seem even smaller than she normally would. In addition to racial prejudice in the form of ""predators"" and ""prey"", there are also nods towards sexism, particularly against females employed in ""masculine"" occupations such as police officers. However, she soon finds herself wrapped up in a mystery involving missing mammals, all predators, who have recently gone missing in Zootopia. Despite initially being forced into being a meter maid by her hard-headed boss Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), she soon finds herself on the case of solving the mystery of the missing mammals alongside a sly, devilishly handsome, con-artist fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). Unlike the more optimistic Judy, Nick is far more pessimistic, seeing no reason in attempting to dispel the stereotypes surrounding foxes that they are untrustworthy. Despite their differences however, they soon discover that they both need each other more than they ever thought, not only to solve the case, but to learn more about themselves, with their friendship allowing them to face, head-on, whatever biases or prejudices they may hold, perhaps without even realizing it. Overall Zootopia is an extremely impressive film on all levels. The animation and character design is absolutely gorgeous, with insane levels of detail in just about every way conceivable, a real step up from even previous Disney 3-D animated films, from the textures and design of the fur, to the wrinkles and folds on the clothing, and the fact that everything is constantly in motion, just like in the real world. The message and overall themes revolving around prejudice and bigotry is also very relevant in modern day American society, which unlike how many try to claim, is not post-racial. However, the film also works incredibly well as a comedy, mystery, and drama film, seamlessly blending in hilarity and thought- provoking satire with heartrending emotional drama and even some pretty decent action scenes. Zootopia also throws in many clever nods and references to other films, both new and old that only more mature viewers are bound to recognize, thus allowing both children and parents to enjoy the film on different levels. Zootopia shows that a film with cute little talking animals can be more than just a film for little kids, but people of just about any age can watch it and find something to relate to or at least learn from through viewing it. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend watching it ASAP! You won't be disappointed!"
" One of the best animation movie ever

It is using perfectly the codes of the polar that the film holds a very current and brilliant statement about our society: security drift, manipulation of the masses, communitarianism and sexism are approached with finesse and treated with efficiency. The universe is rich, funny, convincing, inventive, luminous; In two words: so beautiful! In addition, the film does not forget to pass on its self-criticism, referring regularly to its character of super-prod-Disney and typing cheerfully but without malice on its predecessors at bottom purely ""entertainment"" ""Among others). Highly entertaining, full of sense, contemporary ... A film to be seen absolutely: rejoicing and rewarding."
" Zootropolis
",0.0,0.9861,2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,This film is named 'Zootopia' in the US but the title was changed when it was shown in the UK. I thought it is a very good children's film. Very well animated. Colourful. Really cute animals.It is a great parable about tolerance and racism which could be seen as a mirror to the xenophobia in society today. The story is of a rabbit called Judy Hopps who overcomes diversity to become a police officer in the city of Zootropolis (Zootopia). This is a very tough city full of crime and only strong predators take charge. Judy must help to solve the case of predators disappearing around the city but needs to fight her colleagues' prejudices at the same time.The jokes are funny and the story is intriguing. The film contains lots of references to other films which will keep viewers of all ages happy (including a very funny Breaking Bad spoof). The voice acting is very good and each actor perfectly adds to their character.

Ginnifer Goodwin does a good job as rookie officer Judy Hopps and her character's optimistic demeanor succeed's in putting you in a good mood.2. Jason Bateman was excellent as Nick Wilde and definitely outshines Ginnifer Goodwin in my opinion. His sly, sarcastic personality directly contrasts with Judy Hopps which actually works really well.3. Idris Elba was good as the tough Chief Bobo.4. Jenny Slate was reasonably as Bell Weather.5. Phenomenal story with so many mature themes it's actually incredible.6. Gorgeous animation with an upbeat colour pallet which represents each location well. Speaking of which, the whole world they've built is masterfully designed and is something which definitely needs to be explored in sequels.7. ++++ This movie makes references to 'The Godfather' and 'Breaking Baaaaad'(Sorry just had to!)Bad:1.

" The funniest and most relevant animated feature in years!
",0.5983,0.9884,2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"""Zootopia"" (for some reason known as ""Zootropolis"" in Europe) is a Disney computer animated film that takes place in a mammalian utopia in which all its animals, predatory and non-predatory, live together peacefully.A sophisticated merging of utopian science fiction with a gumshoe detective story, this relates the unlikely partnership between a pint-sized rabbit police officer and a red fox con artist as they uncover a conspiracy involving disappearing animals. It's also a hilarious movie, maybe even more so to adults than children, with one sequence that could be considered the funniest sequence ever put in an animated film. (Those who've seen ""Zootopia"" know what I'm talking about.) This has everything a great animated feature could have: intriguing plot, adorable characters, uproarious comedy, emotional resonances, and a moralistic theme. And some of the best animation ever seen in a cartoon feature. Voiced by Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons and Octavia Spencer, with Ginnifer Goodman perfect as the voice of the rabbit cop Judy Hopps, this is Disney's 55th animated feature, and an indubitable masterpiece in the art of animation. Cartoon enthusiast or not, this is required viewing for every movie lover."
" Zootopia Movie Review: Best Movie for All Ages
",0.6369,0.9981,2017-03-02 00:00:00,10,"A world where animals walk on their hind legs, speak English, and have various occupations is a world just like the one we know now. These animals have feelings, dreams, and motivations just like us humans. They experience hardship and persevere even when something seems impossible. Is this world even possible? Some may say so. For the animators of Zootopia, it was completely within their grasp. ""Zootopia"" is not only an animated movie to entertain children, but also an art form from which people of all ages can learn the true importance of enduring and pushing through hardships.Zootopia is the kind of feel-good movie that both children and adults can enjoy. It stresses the importance of working through the hard times and making the best of a situation. The main character, Judy Hopps, demonstrates this multiple times. In the beginning of the movie, Judy is depicted as a small, child bunny who has big dreams of becoming a police officer in the big city. However, many people doubted that this feat was even possible, especially for a tiny rabbit like Judy. Even her family discouraged her from pursuing her dream. Despite the doubters, Judy disregarded their harsh words and went to the police academy. Here, Judy grew into an amazing police officer and became top of her class. By proving her doubters wrong, Judy was able to show that she could accomplish the impossible. This is an incredibly important lesson for children to learn. There will always be a time in a person's life where things aren't as easy as we would like them to be. Zootopia provides an excellent example of what we can do when we are faced with obstacles. It is important that this lesson is embedded into young children's minds because they can learn early that hardships occur for everyone and it often happens more than once in a person's life, but despite how hard or how many they come along, you should always push through because the outcome will be worthwhile. The second hardship that Judy faces is from her boss. After Judy finally accomplishes getting a job in the big city, she is prepared for anything her boss is willing to let her do. However, her first task is to be the parking maid. Judy is upset, because she had worked so hard to be recognized for her skill, but because she is a tiny rabbit, she was not given the same opportunity that her larger counterparts were given. Taking her task and making the best of it, she decides to double the number of tickets she is expected to give. While on the job, she manages to come across a food market robbery. She chases and catches a weasel who has stolen ""nighthowlers."" After turning him into the police station, her boss still does not recognize her skill. Zootopia presents yet another lesson to be learned: you do not need others' recognition to acknowledge your own skill. Judy knew that she was a skilled police officer and was determined to show her boss just how much she deserves her job. In order to do this, Judy takes on a huge challenge: find a missing otter.Judy goes out to find this missing otter who apparently had gone ""wild,"" and along the way, she found all of the other missing predators. Judy makes the mistake of publicly announcing her theory of this ""savageness"" being in the predators DNA. Her statement offends her close friend, Nick Wilde, whom she met while she was still a parking maid and had supported her the whole way. Judy realizes the depth of her mistake and at first gives up her dream job. She goes back home to her parents' boring carrot farm, however, on this farm, she discovers the true reason for the predator's' ""savageness."" She apologizes to Nick, knowing that she would not be able to save Zootopia without her best friend. Judy realizes the importance of friendship and the power that apologies have. I feel that this is one of the most important lessons for children to learn, because we need a world of forgiveness and kindness. Too many people in the world are cruel; we need more kindness. Zootopia not only provides an entertaining couple of hours for children but also a learning vessel for people of all ages. Through this animation, many important values are expressed. The one that is stressed the most, however, is the value of perseverance. In order to succeed in life, one needs to know how to persevere in spite of challenges that may arise. Zootopia does an excellent job of making this lesson the one that everyone takes away from the movie."
" One of Disney's best animated movies in years.
",0.6369,0.9951,2017-02-28 00:00:00,10,"I don't know what it is about me and anthropomorphic animals. Maybe it's because I grew up watching old cartoons, particularly Tom and Jerry. That could be one of the reasons that I expected more potential out of ""Zootopia"" rather than ""Moana"", with both of these films coming out the same year. In fact, many people expected ""Moana"" to be an instant classic and ""Zootopia"" just to be a simple animated comedy with nothing groundbreaking in it. Boy, were we all surprised when it turned out that ""Zootopia"" was actually more smarter and groundbreaking than we realized. It's one of Disney Animation's best films in the past few years, especially considering how they've had a huge revival and have been turning out some great movies in the past decade.In a world of anthropomorphic animals, a rabbit named Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) dreams of becoming a police officer in the city of Zootopia. However, everybody doubts she can make it to the ranks. Her parents in particular, want her just to be a simple carrot farmer. But, she decides to prove herself and finally makes it into the ranks. Things, however, don't turn out well for her when the police chief doubts her potential and makes her a meter maid. She hates the job, of course and wants to do something that helps the city. So, she decides to try to solve a case in which many mammals disappeared throughout the city. The chief makes a deal with her though. She has to solve the case in seventy two hours or she'll lose her badge. So, its up to her and a witness fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) to solve the case.One of things that really caught my attention with ""Zootopia"" was the animation of the film. It's just gigantic. The city is incredibly detailed. It's a city that animals could have built and live in, and the technology they use is ingenious. And the characters are also ingenious as well. They all have relatable backstories, have likable personalities and aren't perfect. That's what great characters in movies should have. Judy isn't always happy-go-lucky and Nick isn't always sarcastic. They goes through all the emotions. They can get scared, angry, shocked, disgusted and even surprised like good movie characters go through. The story is brilliant as well. It's moral focus mainly on stereotypes which us something you don't usually see in movies. In fact, it's mainly making fun of the stereotypes, like what comedies have been doing since movies have been made. That is just brilliant. ""Zootopia"" is just a great movie. It takes the idea of anthropomorphic animals living in a city and gives something fresh and new, something similar to ""Inside Out"" in my opinion. I do mean it, when I say it's one of Disney's best animated movies in years. It is really that good. It's definitely a must watch and I'm sure like a lot of other people, you'll really enjoy it."
" One of the Best Movies of the 2010s
",0.6369,0.993,2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Zootopia tackles a tough topic in a nuanced fashion and is just as entertaining for adults as for children. Judy and Nick are two of the best characters Disney has produced, who would have thought a fox and bunny make such a good team? The animation is very adorable, you can tell the artists worked very hard to maintain the individual species of animals' characteristics while anthropomorphizing them. Zootopia has plenty of laughs but also some very tearjerking or heartwarming moments. I enjoyed the character of Nick Wilde in particular, he takes Disney's ""Charming Fox"" mantle and wears it as well as Disney's Robin Hood. The voice acting is very good, I completely forgot Idris Elba was in the movie until the end, he IS Chief Bogo in the film. Zootopia is a wonderful entry into the Disney Animated Canon and definitely an instant classic. I think it may have been the best movie I saw all year and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. And again!"
" Really good animated family movie
",0.4927,0.9279,2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,"This is a really, really good animated family movie. It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.Almost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.The movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.The animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.Overall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while."

I really dug Nick Wilde and wish he was the main character, as initially intended in the pitched concept. But the movie still works in a neat, if mildly heavy-handed message on tolerance and avoiding prejudices. That being said, it should not be taken as a direct corollary to the state of the country. If such steps are interpreted, this becomes a terribly questionable premise from the get-go.However, I see it as a quality family film from a company I really don't care for, but will approach their work honestly without prejudice. And that's a beautiful thing, I guess. Carry on, friends."

" Gets one star for that HORRIFIC song!!!!!
",-0.8075,-0.8958,2017-02-18 00:00:00,1,"While watching this movie I really liked the quality of the animation. But then that pos song came on. I blocked it out best I could, then the movie went on. I could never forgive the greedy marketers for this song, so by default I took off 5 stars. I was content with giving it 5 stars. 10 for nice story and animation 1 star for the bad song. A compromise if you will. BUT THEN THEY PLAYED THIS POS SONG AGAIN AT THE END OF THE MOVIE!!! One star it is!I cannot forgive it. We get it you wanna create as many revenue streams as possible. Selling the movie, soundtrack, toys, happy meals, clothing, posters, etc..... BUT you have to stop yourself before you sell out and no one takes you seriously anymore.Really that song is terrible. Even by pop music standards. I know this movie is supposed to be for kids, but damn TOO REPETITIVE! I feel sorry for anyone that was dragged to this movie.Why did I watch it you ask? Well I was in the mood for a movie and saw an ad for this. And thought, well maybe it's not just another dumb kids movie, boy was I wrong.Another problem this movie has is that it's too current. Too many references to modern day things. I miss classic Disney movies, you know the hand drawn 2D ones. I really hate how greedy Disney has become. They spit out a bs animated movie that you will forget 5 seconds later cuz the next bs animated movie is coming out!!!! Whereas Cinderella, Aladdin, The Lion King, etc.... are enduring. They even talked about pirated movies in this....as if to explain why they have to crank out so many movies. Most people will buy into this, they are blinded by the Disney brand. Not everything Disney makes is gold. I, as much as my happiness is chagrined, have standards. And I just can't enjoy such an empty movie. It basically boils down to small town girl fights big town corruption. And we tackle sexism, racism, cellphone humor, slapstick, and other random current things. This is messy. Also for a movie that is against stereotypes they have many in there! But this is not just Disney, most Hollywood movies are like this. They go on at LENGTH about equality but the leads are always young models......"
" The preachy virtue signalling became too hard to swallow
",0.34,0.9894,2017-02-17 00:00:00,5,"So I enjoyed the film. The action, some of the characters and the invention of the makers was really good.However, I did begin to feel the nausea of preachy moralising becoming a little too hard to swallow or rather overtaking the film about half way through.Yes, it's good to embolden children and individuals that they can be what they want to be but it shouldn't be at the behest of others. I've no problems with women being in the army and on the front line but they should be able to do exactly the same as what a man can.Bending the rules or turning a blind to physical inadequacies are fine in the classroom but get to the front line when someone is incapable of physically carrying a fellow wounded soldier or lugging that ammo crate around and your well meaning positive discrimination leads to a less than effective fighting force.Even so I was cool with Hopps getting through the selection (albeit off the literal backs of others) though I started to feel the embrace of political correctness when the front desk guy was remonstrated for calling her cute (with it's less than subtle nod to the n word).Okay, that's still fine as the world we are being presented with in the film is fun and entertaining. The sloths are hilarious and it's all bright and shiny.But half way through the messaging that we are wrong to judge people and the moral posturing began to get a little overwhelming. Yes, a utopia of rivers of chocolate and laughing children and never needing to lock your front door is all very nice but it seemed to be preaching that anyone who didn't think this utopia was achievable was evil or in some way morally corrupt.It didn't seem to be a case of acting on what's right in your heart, tempered with your head, but acting on what the liberal intelligentsia are telling you is right. Having stomached so many 'informed' people preaching that voting for Brexit was because I was a racist thicko, I find it hard to ignore when I feel the air of posturing creeping into the narrative.I've seen many reviews acknowledging what the film is about but that it's subtle and non preachy. I certainly didn't feel that. Maybe I'm more sensitive to it but I didn't go into the film being aware of the moralising that was in it and hence what I felt was an organic reaction to the film rather than having any preconceived ideas.A fun film that made me laugh in the first half/two thirds but one where the lasting impression was that I'd just been lectured/preached to."
" Fun despite being somewhat contrived and moralising
",0.5106,0.9289,2017-02-09 00:00:00,7,"Clever, albeit preachy, 'Can't we all get along/you can be anything you want to be' parable from Disney. This is essentially a 'meet cute', buddy-cop movie starring a rabbit and a fox. There are endless throwaway jokes (I personally liked Bunnyburrow's rapidly increasing population sign), and animal themed puns and word play. The imagery is great with a lot of clever sight gags, again riffing on the 'anthropomorphic animal' theme (the sloths at the DMV was inspired). Not the best (IMO) of the recent crop of animated films but, well made, fun, and watchable (if you don't object to being repeatedly hit over the head with a 'message')."

Jenny Slate and Nate Torrence performed their characters Bellwether and Clawhauser good! Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake played good parents, Bonnie and Stu (even though Stu gives some advice that's not helpful).

" An excellent animated movie with a dark side
",0.5719,0.8885,2017-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Zootopia is the story of Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny with the grand desire of becoming the first rabbit officer in the Zootopia Police Department. Despite working hard and graduating at the top of her class, Judy is stuck as a meter maid until she is given 48 hours to solve a major case. With her badge on the line, she drags wily fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) into the investigation, and the two uncover a conspiracy that threatens the entire city.The theme of the movie focuses on Judy's attempts to become a ""real cop"" and help others despite being a rabbit. The academy instructor mocks her for every failure. Chief Bogo (Idris Elba) assigns her meter maid duty. The con-artist Nick also mocks her at first, although his thoughts change as they work together. Being small is a major drawback in the world of Zootopia as well, but she uses this drawback to her advantage in much the same way the title character of Paul Blart: Mall Cop uses his hypoglycemia to set up a criminal for a surprise attack.While the film is beautiful, there is a darker side. It deals with prejudice between predator and prey, as well as against certain species. For instance, foxes are expected to be shifty and conniving, and Nick explains to Judy why he lives the con-artist life he lives. What is seen of Nick's law-bending life further demonstrates how some species are badly treated, even in the supposed shining city of Zootopia.Lighting is used to great effect in the movie to show moods, such as the point where Judy is begging Nick for help. While he stands in the sunlight, she stands in shadow as if abandoned, and she only joins him in the light after he's agreed to help her. The camera angles are also used to show how different the various species are in terms of size, with even the small bunny Judy towering over the mice in Little Rodentia.Despite the many obstacles she faces, Judy manages to not only become a police officer, but to become the ""real cop"" she has always wanted to be. The film's take on predator/prey relations makes it very believable, and I would highly suggest viewing Zootopia to anyone who likes animated movies or animals."

" One of Disney's greatest
",0.6369,0.9928,2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"I may be a little biased towards Zootopia because it is a Disney/Pixar film, which I tend to love. However, since I didn't grow up with this movie, it didn't have the nostalgia effect on me. Still, Disney lives up to its standards. A movie about the importance of believing in yourself and not falling prey to stereotypes and prejudices, this is a great one for both the kids and adults. The kids will love the fun colors, humor, and action scenes. The adults will appreciate the reference to Frozen by Chief Bogo and when Duke Weaselton (another Frozen reference) shows that he's selling movies that haven't even come out yet like Mewona, Floatzen 2, and Giraffic referring the movies Moana (2016), Frozen 2 (2018), and Gigantic (2018). This movie, like many Disney/ Pixar movies, has so many Easter eggs, it's awesome for big Disney fans. If you're not a Disney fan, however, I'd still recommend this movie to you. It shows how we all fall victim to stereotypes and discrimination, but also stresses that we should try to avoid them. In addition, this movie had my friend and I rolling on the floor laughing. For a kids' movie, the humor is pretty good. I feel like it's easier for most of us to understand Nick Wilde's character better than Judy Hopps's character because Nick's a bit more realistic, if not a bit pessimistic. He's been bullied like many people, but his big flaw is he let that bullying when he was like, 9, follow him until he's about 32. He decides because of that one incident that he will be a sly fox, like everyone expects him to be, instead of what he wants to be. It's never made clear what Nick wanted to do when he grew up, but he seemed pretty happy as a cop in the end."
" Road to Zootopia
",0.0,0.9928,2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Set in an alternate universe without humans in which all mammals live harmoniously in cities, the world's first rabbit police officer forms an uneasy alliance with a fox to solve a mystery in this Disney animated feature film. The movie does a surprisingly good job mixing and a balancing various genres: it is part comedy, part adventure, part mystery, part fantasy, and in amongst all that it has some nifty messages to offer with the species prejudices on display coming quite close to racism in human society today. None of this is particularly subtle with the dialogue frequently spelling out the film's racial agenda, but it is thought-provoking nonetheless and the way the rabbit objects to be called cute even offers a poke at workplace sexism. Solid as the film's messages may be, the film's best achievement is how genuinely funny it is, full of audience-winking quips (""life isn't some cartoon"") and eccentric supporting characters, especially a yak voiced by Tommy Chong. The rabbit's neighbours (only heard; never seen) have some particularly amusing things to say; ""it might be worse!"" comments one of them through the wall after hearing our heroine philosophise about tomorrow like Scarlett O'Hara. And on the subject of movie references, the film features one of the best 'Godfather' spoofs of recent years too. Not all the jokes hit home (especially the final one before the end credits) and the resolution and ending feel a little rushed, but generally speaking, 'Zootopia' is entertaining from start to finish with the deeper things it has to say being merely icing on the cake."
" Welcome to the Jungle
",0.4588,-0.1659,2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Actually welcome to the City (Zoo). Suspend your disbelief you say? Well obviously that is something you should do! It's a cartoon for one and there is an animal society, not unlike many humans have build around the globe. And there are many allegories that may be able to make you think about stuff you do or preoccupied ideas or notions you have about other people.All in all, this does deal with clichés in a funny way, but also has a story that is intriguing. The idea that some can become wild and therefor be a menace to society is not new. But setting it not only in an animated feature but one that is also aimed at kids could be considered risky. But Disney pulls it off. So good in fact that I would not be surprised if the Oscar goes to ... but we'll see about that. Watch it and make up your own mind of course"
" 100 points to Zootopia!
",0.0,-0.9148,2017-01-20 00:00:00,10,"Do you think the racism is all gone? Zootopia shows the answer of this question? Zootopia is a movie about an animal-city, Zootopia.(zoo + utopia) This city looks like a peaceful, democratic city, but in reality, it's not. The high-class animals ignore low-class animals. (I will not spoil the whole story) One of the main character's' name is Judy (a bunny). Judy has wanted to be a police officer since when she witness that some predators(foxes, wolves...etc) were bullying Preys(sheep, rabbits...etc). Understandably, everybody around her said, "" You are too weak and small for be a police officer,"" but Judy graduated the police college as the first place student. I was very impressed about Judy's story ,because this shows the racism. Everybody said that she can't make it, but actually she could do it. The other main character's name is Nick (a fox). Nick is a thief. He didn't want to be a thief, but his environment made him as a thief. Nick hates preys. When he was young, he wanted to join in a boy's group, but the members were preys. They kicked Nick out of the group, because he is a predator. This shows the racism too. Nick was not trying to do hurt them, but the members kicked him out. If I could rate this movie, I would give 5 stars.(5 out of 5) I didn't expect Zootopia to show the racism. I thought it was just a kid's movie, but it showed many social issues in these days. Personally, I love this movie. All characters are so cute, and adorable. Many people love Judy and Nick, so they are shipping Judy and Nick. At first, the director said they are just friend, but later he said ""friendship could be changed to love"". And the most popular character is Raymond S. Persi(a sloth). This sloth is VERY, VERY slow. But at the end of the movie, he got caught by Judy as a speed driver."
" refreshingly modern
",0.0,0.9987,2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Disney does it again. Another follow-your-dreams story featuring a protagonist resisting the voice of society, discovering who she is, and otherwise inspiring young audiences to do the same: to follow their dreams, to go after their ideals and desires, no matter the obstacle. For if you don't give up, and trust in your friends, you will surely succeed.Judy Hopps is a rabbit who aspires to be a policewoman, despite her parents' fear of the bigger, more predator-filled world out there in Zootopia and the absence of rabbit policemen. Unlike other Disney films, however, rather than end with the dream/identity being fulfilled, Zootopia goes beyond that and thrusts Judy into reality. Of course, being Disney, you know the good guys will triumph and everyone will be happy in the end and the bad guy turns out to be someone you've already met, you know, the usual stuff, BUT STILL, I like how Judy's dream of becoming a policewoman doesn't end there, and the plot entails a touching friendship and a message of social equality rather than the mere dream archetype. The utopia of Zootopia turns out to be darker in hue than Judy ever imagined.Zootopia is a land of mammals, predator and prey, who coexist and live as civilized beings. They're basically human but in animal form, and Disney brilliantly illustrates such a setting according to each animal's natural characteristics -- like how the streets run with multiple sizes of cars for, say, lemmings and tigers, or how the city is made up of districts for each habitat, etc. Another significant difference between Zootopia and previous Disney films is the incorporation of modern technology, such as smartphones. Watching Zootopia, you really feel like you're watching humans, just humans who look like animals on the outside. But they're human. Long ago, when the docile denizens of Zootopia were like the animals of our world -- that is, members of a natural food chain -- they decided to unite, and become civilized. In the same way, we humans have advanced in civilization and our ideals of toleration. As time passes, more and more do we see unyielding support for civil rights, first blacks, then women, now LGBT. As fellow human beings and fellow social animals, it is in our innate capacity to love and tolerate.And being Disney, the soundtrack and songs are amazing and catchy; the puns and references to popular culture are prevalent and hilarious; and the characters are well-developed and memorable. In addition, Zootopia astounded me with the quality of its animation. The studio has certainly improved since the days of Snow White.Like the featured song, ""Try Everything,"" when you fall, you can get up and try again. Our world may not be a utopia. In fact, it is far from one. But there is beauty and wonder still, and hope, and friendship, and love. Why not give it your all?"
" Even better than Frozen (2013)
",0.4404,0.9651,2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Zootropolis is a fun comedic adventure film made by Disney in 2016. The good thing about this film is that there are absolutely NO adult jokes hidden beneath words so all kids can watch all the scenes because they are very understandable.There are hundreds of characters spanning from bunny's to lions to naked giraffes. The main characters (Bunny and Fox) have to work together to sort out an animal scam going on.The story line for this film is absolutely perfect in many ways. The characters are funny and there is a lot of adventure. The comedy is just grand. The sloth scene was just hilarious, people in the cinema couldn't stop laughing for a good few minutes, even after the scene ended. Kids all ages will enjoy this film.The part where a few animals go savage is a little bit scary. My sister screamed. (Age 8) But other than that there are almost no inappropriate, scary or crude scenes or references during the movie. To conclude this film is a great family friendly feel good film of the year. It is no doubt one of the best animated film of the decade and it will most likely be popular for a very long time."
" Not As Deep Or Clever As It Thinks It Is
",0.4588,-0.7212,2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"I guess this is about prejudices and discrimination of all kinds but I don't think it's very smart or incisive, or even particularly clever or witty. It picks the prejudices it wants to deal with and mostly sticks to those, while also undermining those same messages by reducing many others to those same kinds of stereotyping (rednecks, Italian mafioso, etc) and there doesn't seem to be any indication this is intentional or meant as subversiveness.Maybe it doesn't matter that much, this movie isn't meant to be a deep and thorough undertaking but it still hurts the film when its messages are blatantly obvious and screamed in your face and then slyly ignored when there's plot needed and a joke to be had.The rest of it is pretty standard modern animated pop-culturally aware farce."
" Surprisingly good!
",0.6588,0.9958,2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I'm not usually into Disney. Everything is too soft for me. I like a few, mostly because I saw them when I was a kid and they make me nostalgic. I rented this mostly because there was a sale and if you rented five movies you could have them for a week for seven euros, and it was a bargain, and I remembered my sister wanted to see this at least at one point. I did want to see this for a few reasons. One of them was that people mostly said it was great. Another was that Jason Bateman was in this movie. Now I'm not his biggest fan or anything, but I've watched enough Arrested Development to like him. So, what the hell, I watched it.I was so pleasantly surprised. What's the highest rating I've given a children's animated movie? The Lego Movie, which was awesome, and I gave it 9 / 10. Zootropolis doesn't come close to The Lego Movie, but Zootropolis is great. It is funny, and it is actually super thrilling. I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen, and what had happened, and all that. It also has just the perfect amount of scary. I'm glad I watched this.Of course there are few things that bother me like why isn't Disney using voice actors instead of some random Hollywood live action actors and actresses. Like sure, they get more viewers, but there are amazing voice actors and actresses out there, who could be magical in a movie like this. Now it's mostly like ""hey, that dude sounds familiar"" and maybe recognising one actor (Tommy Chong). It's not like the cast is bad but... why can't you use people who will definitely, absolutely do a great job?Also this movie could be a great metaphor for racism and all kind of prejudice, but it's a bit... weird. It's mixed. First it seems that everyone is pushing the prey down, but in the end everyone is awful towards PREDATORS, like hey, maybe don't be prejudice against that huge ass beast who could murder you and eat you. If you are a tiny bunny, you kind of have the right to be scared of a jaguar or whatever. Maybe you're not supposed to think about these animals as humans, but still you are kind of telling kids hey, that person who bullies you and hurts you? They have their own issues going on. Sure, they might have some issues of their own, but that doesn't make it okay... I don't know where I'm going with this, but this situation kind of bothers me.But other than those things, this movie is surprisingly good. Like I said, super thrilling yet fun. I really like this movie."
