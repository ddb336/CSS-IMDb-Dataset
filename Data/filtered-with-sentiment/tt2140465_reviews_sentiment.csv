" Kangana's impressive double turn
",0.5106,0.9984,2021-04-01 00:00:00,7,"The use of double roles has been a prevalent plot element in Hindi films for decades. There isn't one popular actor of yesteryear mainstream cinema who didn't play dual roles at least once in his films, and it was common expectation of each star to play double so as to prove their acting prowess. Sometimes it worked quite wonderfully, and sometimes the results were laughably bad. Few of these films were of good quality, among which Ramesh Sippy's Seeta Aur Geeta remains a definitive classic where both the film and the lead performance by Hema Malini made wonders. Anand L. Rai makes Tanu Weds Manu Returns, and it definitely belongs to the category of good films employing dual roles. It might not be a perfect film, but it works. The film is actually a sequel to the enjoyable musical romance Tanu Weds Manu, but it is pretty much a film of its own which could be watched without having to see the prequel. It is essentially very different from the prequel in style, mood and execution, but most importantly, this is one of the rare occasions where a sequel is better than the first film.Tanu Weds Manu Returns is amusing and entertaining, but above all, it is a nice film. The script is good, with some wonderful dialogue and cleverly handled situational comedy which generally doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience. The very first scene where Tanu and Manu recount their dysfunctional marriage and argue along the way is testament to that - it is excellent and consistently funny. Sadly, the second half starts losing some of its wittiness as it goes on and somewhere towards the end it starts gathering moments of pure silliness and some messy portions which drag it a bit down. Some of the scenes during the wedding reception in particular were not easy to follow and included too many unnecessary diversions. In that respect, the film's style is inconsistent, and it's placed somewhere between the old classics by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and the silly comedies by David Dhawan. Another one of its biggest minuses for me was the poor dubbing and sound which often did not sound natural or genuine and took away from the quality achieved in the writing.Among the highlights of this film, the film's highpoint is the scene where Tanu and Datto finally meet, and it is absolutely delightful. Indeed, Kangana Ranaut reaches impossible heights in her exploration of her own artistic limits. Generally speaking, her dialogue delivery is much more refined and confident than it used to be in some of her previous films, and she plays the two roles so differently one can almost forget it is the same actor. As the titular Tanu, she is typically wicked and unlikable and plays her just fine even if she overdoes a little her scowl at times. Her biggest achievement, however, is the creation of Datto, one of the loveliest, most distinct characters one can think of, and she plays her with amazing vigor and affection. The Haryani accent she employs for her is impressive and just adorable. Madhavan, who was brilliant in the prequel, is relegated to a supporting actor in this film, which is sad but so is everyone else. They're all the backdrop for Ms. Ranaut, and she is the star of this show. This project is overall a very good film which is worth a watch, particularly for Kangana, whose presence shines."
" Better than first one.
",0.4404,0.872,2021-03-23 00:00:00,8,Actors and actress are awesome. Specially Kangana. Story was good and entertaining.
" There is nothing wrong with this one.
",0.3724,0.8789,2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Even if there was few here and there, that you can easily tolerate. You can't argue anyone else portraying the role other than Kangana. She is just too good.She made the movie better than it actually is.Yet the supporting cast and dialogue are equally compelling as the first. Kangana rocketed in this one.If you don't agree."" udhar dekh udti chiditya"""

" One of the Stupidest Films of 21st Century
",-0.5267,0.9796,2020-10-05 00:00:00,2,"I will never get back those 2 hours. What a nonsense story !!! People who loved this film have no sense of good films. Also, all the jury members of National Awards were lost their senses and they voted for Kangana for this stupid film. She was the most deserving actress for Fashion only. Queen was good but not great, Parvathy was the most deserving actress for that year (For Charlie and Ennu Ninte Moideen). All the audiences who loved these two films (Part 1 & 2), they just love all kinds of melodrama of typical Hindi Serial. Just don't go for it if you have a very good taste in watching good films. Your valuable time will be saved."

" Wonderful premise ruined by a bait-and-switch no-lessons-learned ending.
",0.1531,0.6993,2020-07-01 00:00:00,4,"An otherwise promising and enjoyable movie ruined by a last-minute bait-and-switch back to a stereotypical Bollywood/Hollywood ending that flies in the face of the very premise the movie starts with; namely, that these movie romance marriages would likely be disasters if we revisited the couple a few short years later. If there's a third movie to this series it had better be a very dark comedy because now even more lives have been ruined with no lessons being learned by anyone except perhaps the well-meaning but now twice-jilted fianc√© who hopefully stays well clear of these horrible people in the future."
" Live but don't let them live
",0.0,-0.9554,2020-04-03 00:00:00,4,"Tanu and Manu have been married from four years or so. They are fed up of their everyday fights. Tanu puts Manu in an insane asylum in London and goes back to India. Behaves like a terrible jackass when a family arrived to see her sister. Starts dating Raja.Manu, after being released from asylum and coming back to India, finds Datto, who looks like Tanu. He starts liking Datto and both decides to marry. This decision becomes easier for him when Tanu sends him a divorce notice.But Datto turns out to be the same girl that Raja was about to marry if not for Manu's sudden intrusion. Tanu, after knowing about his husband's (yet) marriage gets angry. She decided to stop at at first, but gets soft after meeting Datto. Now, she wants to see their wedding happening. I am not revealing what happens next but I know you have already anticipated the ending.Now, from the entire story, I conclude that Tanu is a selfish girl. She embarrassed her family in front of strangers. She can date anyone but has a problem when her husband decides to marry. But in the second half, she is shown to be a victim.I can't complain if it has flawed characters. But the overall story is just okay. Nothing new, just a love triangle. Has it's moments at the starts though. And obviously, what happened in the end is not justified."
" Love it
",0.6369,-0.1321,2018-12-18 00:00:00,9,"I watched the first movies and the sequel in a day, i really hope manu weds with kusum. Even after i finished watch it, the thought was lingering in my head. But after I realized that Tanu and Kusum was a same person, this disturbing feelings were gone. LoL"
" Not good as Tanu Weds Manu
",-0.3412,0.9612,2018-09-06 00:00:00,6,"The movie is a sequel, It's a one time watch movie with nice music. However story line could be improved and the character of Jimmy Shergill was strong in the previous movie which lacks in this one. Kangana did justice with her characters and Madhavan is always good. The overall movie lacks the charm of original Tanu Weds Manu."
" BEST SEQUEL EVER MADE
",0.6369,0.9465,2018-08-17 00:00:00,9,"Anand L Rai has become one of my favourite directors! Himanshu sharma and Anand L Rai are the best in the business!
The story is So amazing you'll laugh,you'll cry,you'll smile...
Kangana Ranaut has done perfection with both her roles!
No other actress would have done justice to the role!"
" Catering the need of Indian Audience by creating fake boldness
",0.1531,0.9892,2017-09-09 00:00:00,4,"This film 'Tanu weds Manu Returns' reaches to its climax when Datto replies Tanu's taunt in a Haryanvi manner when both confronts at the first time. There Tanu has to keep quite. Clearly, Tanu has got someone more tougher than her. Next morning she feels sorry for her behavior and asks for forgiveness and from there the film starts fulfilling the Indian audience's emotional need.The director and the writer stretched the film, lengthening its plot and maneuvering it towards happy ending for the Indian audience using same melodramatic techniques of justifying Indian culture and proving marriage as sacrosanct.Had the director ended the film with a successful marriage of Datto and Manu and of Tanu and Raja, the film would have better resolution and also he would have more chances of creating Tanu weds Manu's third part with the stretched plot. Nevertheless the films ends up as a traditional marriage drama, which tries to boasts as a bold attempt on the questions of marriage but hesitates to show real boldness in resolving critical issues and takes an escapist route to please the audience.Madhavan has nicely portrayed Manu as a confused NRI doctor. His character appears to create an arc, but remains as it is what we saw him at the beginning.Similarly Tanu's character shows boldness, free spirited but later on she becomes emotional fool and acts in a very traditional way, leaving any possibility of changing her character and so failing to create a mature parson with a greater character arc.Instead, Datto's character grows emotionally, becomes a more learned person going through the rapidly changing events (from her first meet with Manu, travel to Punjab and confronting Tanu) and the very same way Raja (Jimmy Shergil) grows up mature, leaving his ego, telling Tanu that he is a simple person and turning himself as a complete different person.At the End the story does not remains of only Tanu and Manu but very subtly shifts its gaze towards Datto and Raja.Overall, the film veils some critical issues by ending itself at a happy emotional tone, making it as a family entertainer, catering the needs of Indian audience.But does it really end(?) because on the end credits we see Tanu again getting angry with Manu whereas Datto and Raja finds solace in each other."
