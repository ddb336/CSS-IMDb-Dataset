" Shame on Bollywood !
",-0.5255,0.7601,2021-03-25 00:00:00,1,"Peshwa Bajirao was one of the legendary ultimate warrior and statesman that India has ever seen. He was not only intelligent in terms of political wisdom, but also highly skilled in terms of warfare. He was a warrior that not even the likes of Aurangzeb and Akbar could match in terms of intellect and battlefield supremacy.This film makes a mockery of his life and tries to depict him as a broken lover. It makes the viewer believe that Bajirao's story starts and ends with Mastani.Shri Chimaji Appa Rao was his his faithful brother and accomplice, and certainly not the jealous, insensitive courtier as shown in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's movie."

The way the moive is been put keep u on track of the history but at the same time the actor keep u engaged in there love story. The chemistry of the actor is really awesome.

The best and the whole way why the pic hold up strong is there script and dailogue they are very prefectly framed and very well spoken. The picture will never bore you and you can surely watch it multiple times.A great moive to watch on a nice chilled afternoon

" Respects its disclaimer more than history!
",0.3802,0.1335,2020-07-08 00:00:00,6,"Making a film on History,Action & Romance is different than making a film on Fantasy,drama & romance,the makers should get this thing correct before misleading the viewers.
The very beginning moments of the film boast of a grand canvas & visuals and keeps the story going right yet the details in battle formations & tactics were little taken care of.The storytelling gets interrupted after the first half an hour as songs start reeling one after the other as if it's a showcase of dance choreography than Bajirao's history.In doing so,the runtime stretches itself to almost 170 minutes for a story that can barely last 2 hrs.However what's worth appreciating is Ranveer Singh's performance,the dialogues & decent enough direction.Post interval,as the story tries to build up quite a bit it's again ruined by the final 30 minutes of the film.The last battle scene shows Bajirao racing away with a horse out of sheer rage towards his enemies constantly dodging hundreds of arrows,thereby showing how much less attention was given to the Action choreography in the film.Further in the film's concluding moments, history witnesses it's lines being blurred away into Bhansali's fantasy books.
If someone desperately wants to see the film,they can watch it for good visuals,Ranveer's commendable performance, historical romance and some lack a brain entertainment & actions, skipping it would be any day a wiser choice."
" Watch it just connect to lyrics of the each song which is a Marvel in itself
",0.4215,0.9836,2020-06-03 00:00:00,9,"No wonder Bansali spent 10 years on this movie. It is just a grand expression of his immense creativity. I have read that it all began with marathi phrase in ""Deewani Mastani"" song which was composed 10 years ahead of release of the movie.
I truely believe if you need to make something marvelous you must just keep it close to your heart like a child and sprinkle it with love like creativity each day a little more. All of this effort of Bansali sir has bared fruits in this movie and is a wonder to experience in its true sense. I love each every line of all songs as the are filled with meaning and are interlocked strongly with emotions depicted in the movie. Especially, ""Ab Tohe Jaane Naa Doongi"" having a line ""Ek hain mannat, ek hain dua"", ""Daaye se padhe ya baaye se padh, arsh se farsh tak ishq hain likha"" Translation : You may read from left(as in urdu literature) or you may read from right (Sanskrit literature). Either you can look at sky(as in namaaz) or you could bow down (as in hindu custom) both are just one and the same.
Thanks to Sanjay Bhansali, Ranveer Singh, Priyanka Chopra, Deepika Padukone and others for making this wonder possible in Indian Cinema."
" Typical Bhansali Massacre.
",0.0,-0.8483,2020-06-01 00:00:00,5,"I saw Padmaavat and thought it was the best film I saw that year. Then peope started saying watch Bajirao Mastani and see what he has done with this film. I was a bit hopeful of a decent plot. I saw it last night with my wife at home and I found the whole thing ridiculous, predictable. You see - Bhansali's idea of love and romance in films is quite typical. This reminded me of Ram Leela and Devdas - both are painful films to watch. The acting talents of Ranveer and Deepika could not save this ship from sinking. There are several exaggerations made but that is not the issue. The story is quite poor, the songs and dances are great - but like many historical films this made me question why I am spending 150 minutes on it. I am leaving 5 stars because of the sets, the song dances and the modicum of decency maintained by Ranveer. The last 45 minutes should have been deleted. 53 minutes into the film I thought about how bad the timing of the film is. I never call a film slow and so I won't call it slow. It was painfully bad. Watch at your own peril and watch if you are a student of film."
" Great
",0.6249,0.7902,2020-02-23 00:00:00,9,"Bollywood reached its cinematic greatness in Bajirao. The sequence, the camera work and story telling at its best. All the actors' performance were notable. Very well put together. Bajirao Mastani just set new standards in Bollywood industry. Nothing recent comes close."
" For his country, he won all his battle.For his lover, he lost even he himself.
",0.7351,0.8252,2020-01-26 00:00:00,8,"Recommended by my dear friend, i share the same view that it is worth watching though i regard Baahuobali's more attractive. Weakly based on history, Bhansali told the Maratha famous story well still, or at least, it depict it completely and offer us the outside audience a chance to know Indian history, religions and legend.
Besides, since love is a theme being ceaselessly written, discussed, screened and extolled, lover's fight against religion, however, is rare and personally, may be the first topic-related movie(may be even 'work') i have watched. Therefore, while watching, many questions occured to me, like why they cannot marry? Was it because of fearing of being tarnished? but i have also heared that it is allowed that lower caste womam marry higher caste man provided that she brought with herself abundant money, or because it is the very existence of such tragedies alike in indian history that gradually the traditional view evolved?(Hope there is no offence word or potential of offencing meaning out of my ignorance of indian culture).So here comes my suggestion that itcan be better if more religious description being added.
Apart from the film content itself, i also wonder to know is it true that love can be so powerful that a woman would be empowered to forgo everything only to marry her lover and if so, why( i expect an answer combined with the background )?(And if is so, then i would pity myself, as sb said that it is the person without love most pitiful🙃 for i even don't believe it now🙃)
Conclusion, i enjoyed this movie as i expected, so i would like to recommend it to others who'd interested in Indian epic/love legend/war topic-related movie.
p.s i really disgust Bajirao's mother the kind of person, oh how much hatred and pity i hold for her. Ignorant, self-serving and firmly thinking herself being smart and right, she was a victim of traditional ideology without self-knowing and soul-searching conscious! If she was a little more kind, then my hatred toward this character can be mitigated, however, what a pity. so this film remind me sth different, Bhansali said he want to explore the difference in history, actually he showed us the similarity thoughout history, ignorance and evil never decease.
p.s 2, like my topic, Bajrao won all his battle for his country, butfor his lover, he can do nothing, can i deem this as a defeat of being a man?what's man's opinion toward this kind of defeat(discuss within movie content)?"

",0.0,0.9911,2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,"Following the advise of a non-Indian cinefile, and after a look at the trailer, I gave this a try and I was certainly rewarded.
It is certainly not worth an objective 10, however I only mark 1, 5 or 10.Despite the at times mediocre Cgi the overall production values are extremely good. The director amuses himself and us with many symmetrical images of impressive settings combined with Cgi backrounds to make dreamlike results. Same goes for the costumes.The acting of the male protagonist seemed to follow a local perception of a wannabe idolized character, who must look awesome and kickass at any time. What might seem locally awesome, would mostly annoy or have a giggle effect to western audiences. Only at the end of the lengthy 3hours the actor shows some qualities.
On the other hand, the triangle wife, mother, lover characters and actrices excell and pull the strings of the entire movie.The bollywood traditional inclusion of dancing parts is connected to the scipt with good transitions and will not seem ackward at all.Despite certain flaws and apparent influences from western film making, the overall product is highly entertaining despite its length. In addition, it is a quite accurate adaptation of historical events"

" Beautiful and grand, great acting
",0.9001,0.9811,2018-07-12 00:00:00,7,"Bajirao Mastani follows the story of warlord Bajirao (Ranveer Singh) and princess Mastani (Deepika Padukone) as they fall in love against their own better judgment and the wishes of those around them. Many people are against their relationship, not only because of their different religions, but also because Bajirao is already married to Kashibai (Priyanka Chopra).This movie is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Every single shot is visually rich with beautiful set design, cinematography, colour pallettes and costumes. (Some of the CGI isn't very convincing, though.) Only for this I would already recommend people to watch it.
The movie's soundtrack is magnificent too; especially the song Deewani Mastani is a personal favourite of mine. Although I didn't like all of it, it has got nice melodies and is very rhythmic.What I disliked in the movie is (although I hate to admit it) how boring it got. In the first act, there is conflict and good pacing in the story, but in the second act it feels like the story is just meandering towards its ending. Any touching moments felt unearned because it was hard for me to stay invested in the story.
Also, they barely age even though the story takes place over 15 years or something?Nevertheless, Bajirao Mastani is a beautiful and touching movie, and I recommend people to watch it."
" A perfect masterpiece on all levels
",0.8316,0.9965,2018-04-29 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the one that I want to see over and over again without feeling bored. The story is perfectly established, keeps getting interesting through all parts. It deals with romance yet not dull, about war but not filled with actions, and historical but not boring. Acting is attractively beautiful, very professional, very precise when it comes to emotional or action parts. There are almost no spices in this movie, so much less than what one would expect. Directing is better than perfect, even the three or four songs within the movie are so beautiful, very enthusiastic, and very well directed. I know I am using a lot of ""very good"" and ""so beautiful"" words, but the movie deserves even more. This movie is one of the best (if not The Best) movies of its category. I am really seeking to learn Hindi language because of this very movie. I strongly advice watching it."
" Not as much music and dance as you might have wanted
",0.0,0.9987,2018-04-20 00:00:00,7,"But it's such a lovely movie. I went into it because I saw a video that was just Malhari and I thought the dancing, costumes and set was stunning in that scene, so I wanted to watch the entire movie. 
There were only about 4 dance sets in it? And Malhari was far and above the best. I really was hoping for more because the choreography was so great, but I still found myself engrossed in the movie despite that. The story is objectively ridiculous and ignores a lot of socio-cultural issues of the time in favor of keeping the questionable romance in the limelight, but you don't go into Bollywood for that kind of critique. It's a fun story told in a fun and visually stunning manner, with a great leading cast, and if you just suspend disbelief for what, 3 hours? Then you'll have a great time. So yeah, I wish there were more music numbers, but the soundtrack was still great even in the background and I'm really glad I watched it. (I enjoyed it like it was worth more stars, but I rate movies objectively, and there were a lot of flaws that I could easily ignore but still make me unable to rate it up there with the best of the best. )"

",0.0,0.5267,2018-03-07 00:00:00,3,"BAJIRAO MASTANI is an epic-length Bollywood historical romance guaranteed to test the patience of any viewer. It tells of a sappy and long-winded romance between two rival characters: the hero of the hour is tough-guy Bajirao, the heroine a similarly tough warrior princess called Mastani. They do hook up but not before a lot of songs have been sung and cheesy CGI-augmented battle scenes have played out. I found the whole film to be completely underwhelming, made in a flashy and superficial style that prevented me from getting close to any of the characters. The leads in this film dress gaudily and have bizarre facial decorations which I also found more than a little off-putting. With a running time in excess of two and a half hours I found this extremely tiresome."
" A Lavish Disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.0258,2018-02-18 00:00:00,6,"A quality period drama film with lavish sets. The film manages to hold audience attention, however, the ending leaves much to be desired. Battle scenes used CGI and looked artificial. Some good dialogues & performances by Ranvir, Deepika & Priyanka is probably drawing the crowds. A pain to sit through and a benchmark for lavish failures. And to top it all, such garbage receives awards."
" A travesty of epic proportions.
",-0.5719,-0.9866,2017-11-12 00:00:00,1,"This film is both a costly epic and a fantasy turkey biography, not to mention a miserable n failed attempt at creating a story to overtake Romeo n Juliet n Mughal e Azam. Even at nearly 160 minutes long, this ponderous, talky, and melodramatic biopic fails to impress. The critics in India are just impressed with the sets and costumes.As one reviewer on IMDb rightly said about the mess. The director has no clue whether he is making a 17th century historical epic or a Rohit Shetty flick or a fantasy action epic or romantic melodrama or erotic poem here. Watch the scene with Priyanka. Straight outta Kamasutra.Every historical epic film will have a battle or action sequence. Well, this film has only two, one in the beginning n the other towards the end. But the worst part is not the less amount of battle sequences, it is the execution.
The cgi/sfx were poorly done as the graphics were looking fake. The battle sequences were laughable. It reduced the lead character into a fantasy super hero. The first scene copied straight outta 300 and Ong bk. The other battle sequence was more like a Rajnikant style. Thousands of arrows and the single hand defense tactic was a laugh out loud n wtf.This movie even fails as a historical fantasy. Mastani playing a mandolin. Hohoho. Mandolin existed in India during that time? A prime minister/military leader dancing with the infantry n cavalry. Hohoho. That is hilarious. The moves. Maybe the military leader was on Datura given to him by some godman.Wait, i forgot about the dialogues. Cheesy ones mate. Referring one another as vegetables n fruits is epic. That too, in Nana Patekars voice.The rest of the movie is dreadful, a clunker script delivered in a cluster of accents. The accents r silly. Nowhere do we get to see Bajirao or his first wife speak in the Marathi language.In short, this film is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented. This film is a bloated, overlong, and frankly boring epic. It is a rather slow because of the horrendous editing n at times tedious and soporific film that is far away from being great.There is a clear pattern to colour Islamic rulers as villains with no reference to any facts based on authentic sources of information, said Heeram Chaturvedi, head of department of history at Allahabad University.Distorting history is the new norm in Bollywood.One group is glorified while another vilified.Check out historical books from the British archives. Khilji wasn't barbaric. In fact, he was the most suave n sophisticated ruler. There was no such thing as India during that time. The so called freedom from invaders is a big hoax. Wars were fought merely on the basis of territory.Britishers abolished Sati n gave us education.Look where v r inspite of the so called freedom. The lower caste fellas r totally neglected, the minorities r lynched in broad daylight, female infanticide n female foeticide is rampant. Look at the matrimonial columns. Sick people in India still wants fair colored brides. Adivasis r robbed of their homes.Hate ethnocentric behavior n films. The most detrimental effects of ethnocentrism resulting into genocide, apartheid, slavery, and many violent conflicts. Historical examples of these negative effects of ethnocentrism are The Holocaust, the Crusades, the Trail of Tears, and the internment of Japanese Americans."
" Package is pretty, very little substance inside
",0.4939,0.9953,2017-06-08 00:00:00,4,"2 minutes of silence for those who are comparing it to Mughal-e- azam. People who are calling it a masterpiece, are either paid or just simply retarded. While I do believe it is visually stunning, (like any other Sanjay Leela Bhansali film), but we cannot keep praising someone just for his cinematography. Story is the main thing a man comes to watch at a movie theater and when there's none, it becomes lack-lustrous, boring and yawn-worthy. In this matter, Bhansali is way too overrated. His films lack story. This movie was as disappointing as his previous project, Ram-Leela.The four stars I have given in my rating are this way: 1. Priyanka Chopra's performance: She is the show-stealer. She kept her acting well confined and let the lead actors shine. And that is her power. She out-shined all the other actors within her small screen presence, or shall I say, strong screen presence.2. Ranveer Singh's performance: Well he is a star. His acting is at par with any great actor you name, be it SRK, Aamir Khan, or even Big B. His acting was so top-notch that you really wonder if you are watching a real person. He gave Bajirao a real persona, a style which shall be mimic in the future and develop a cult status. His dialogue delivery was so sharp, you see it not only in his words but in his eyes. It is not easy to express pain with a smiling face. Huge applause to Ranveer for portraying the complexities of Bajirao with such precision.3. Cinematography: The cinematography is as always epic. No wonder every scene looks like an oil painting. Every frame looks like an oil painting. Too much research had been done to find the swords, chandeliers, wall paints and backgrounds. The way they brought them together was really stunning. But then if I compare it to Devdas, Black, Saawariya, I felt the cinematography to be a little dull. 4. Catching-off guard: There are a few scenes which will catch you off guard. Suddenly a laughing-out-loud Bajirao will stop laughing while others (who thought the joke was funny) will stand in awkward silence. Suddenly Kashibai will change the topic and a smiling face will utter the most tormenting lines. This kind of unpredictability was classy. It is a welcome change in Indian cinema and it sure paves the way for better content writing. What turned me off:1. Story telling/Screenplay and Editing: The editing was blasphemous and so was the story-telling. How could you do this to a movie like that? It looked more like a TV serial with random slow-motions and forced ""tashion"" on the lead characters. The continuations were so obvious that I began yawning even before the interval. y.2. Deepika's performance: Woah. After watching this movie I came up with this big realization, Deepika is highly overrated. She may become the greatest actress in future but as of now, she is just a pair of two big eyes and a pretty face. Her dialogue delivery is a killjoy. I pondered on the dialogues given to her. The dialogue writer must be pulling his hair off every time Deepika opened her mouth. I have never been so disappointed with a leading actress before. She was so not suitable for the role of Mastani. Had it been given to Priyanka, she would have pulled it off like a pro. 3. Music: Music was dull! Hands down. Only ""Aayat"" was heart touching.It would have been great if Aayat was kept as main score. But anyways, Bollywood cannot live without including 5 silly tracks in their movies so sin forgiven.The above faults are double turnoffs and hence I am deducting 2 stars each. This film could have been better, if:***spoilers ahead***>>There had been more sexual tension between Bajirao and Mastani. When he heals her wound with his dagger, the awkward hug was unnecessary. Had it been a close control-yourself-from-touching-a- man kinda encounter, like she holding his collar instead of embracing him, would have been far sexier. >> There should have been more importance given to Kashi. Kashibai sees Rao and Mastani embracing each other after she informs Bajirao about the upcoming attack on her and thus helps him save Mastani. At that moment instead of letting her come running and return with an awkward face, they should have let Kashi stand behind the door and watch Rao saving Mastani. The eye-contact between the two, with Rao's gratefulness and Kashi's selflessness would have had more impact. Overall, this movie is a one time watch. There is nothing memorable apart from the acting of Ranveer and Priyanka. If you have no serious job then maybe this movie is for you. Otherwise, save your precious time."

In spite of Shripad Rao's (Aditya Pancholi) self- nomination as the Pant Pratinidhi, Ambaji Pant (Milind Soman) chooses to nominate a young Bajirao (Ranveer Singh). To test his spiritual wisdom and knowledge of weaponry, Shripad challenges Bajirao to split a peacock feather with an arrow. Bajirao succeeds and is given the title of Shrimant Peshwa. Ten years later, his wife Kashibai (Priyanka Chopra) is visited by her widowed friend Bhanu (Snehlata Girish Vasaikar), whose husband was accused of spying and hence was ordered to be executed by Bajirao. She bitterly forebodes that just like she longs for her husband, Kashi, too, will yearn for Bajirao.While traveling to Sironja, an emissary from Bundelkhand infiltrates Bajirao's tent and demands his help in fighting invaders. She reveals herself to be Mastani (Deepika Padukone), the daughter of the Hindu Rajput King, Chhatrasal (Benjamin Gilani) and his Muslim Persian consort, 'Ruhani Bai'. Impressed by her skills as a warrior, Bajirao assists her with his army and defeats the invaders. Chhatrasal is overjoyed and insists that Bajirao spend Holi with them. Mastani and Bajirao develop feelings for each other and he gifts her his dagger, which is a symbol of marriage among the Bundelkhand Rajputs. He soon departs for Pune, where Kashi greets him with a tour of their newly-built Shaniwar Wada and shows him the Aaina Mahal (hall of mirrors) which allows her to see him from her room."
" A magnificent movie
",0.5994,0.9991,2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"True to Bhansali's signature style, this epic love saga, touted as his magnum opus is opulent, dreamy & magnificent. Lavish palaces, mirrored chambers, glittering chandeliers, royal robes & dazzling jewelry – Bajirao Mastani is a richly woven historical tapestry of romance, passion, hatred & conspiracy, all of it veiled in a tantalizing enigma. The film unfolds like an unexplored fable of love between the legendary Maratha general Peshwa Bajirao I & the ethereal half- Muslim princess Mastani. As Rao engages in battles against the Mughals for Chhatrapati Shahu, he is approached by the beautiful Mastani who requests protection for Bundelkhand. In the process, they fall in love. But how will Rao's first wife Kashibai react to this? Will Bajirao's family accept Mastani as his wife & not concubine? Can their love overcome the rigid social barriers & emerge victorious in this battle against the state, family & age-old traditions? Owing to few glitches here and there, Bajirao Mastani falls short of being a masterpiece but it is definitely the perfect tribute to the chivalrous warrior, his gutsy Mastani & the selfless Kashibai. From Bajirao and Mastani's undying passion for each other that transcends all social barriers to their unfulfilled dream of togetherness to Kashibai's unrequited love, everything was beautifully scripted and brought to life by poignant performances. Also, unlike Jodha Akbar, Bajirao Mastani doesn't overlook uncomfortable issues like male infidelity as we see Kashibai questioning Mastani about the reliability of Bajirao's heart. One must also applaud the film's respectable and realistic approach to the issue of bigamy. It doesn't glorify or demean any character to justify its theme. Nor does it give a romanticized version of Bajirao; he is a great warrior & a good man but not without flaws. The triumph of the film's characterization lies in the fact that we feel compelled to empathize even with those who oppose the love story. Whether it is Bajirao or Mastani or Kashi or Ma Saheb, everyone has his or her own reasons and we can clearly see the conflict of head and heart simmering in their eyes. Scenes like Kashi destroying the curtain that reflects the events in Aina Mahal and Bajirao's letter to Mastani stating that Kashibai is both his wife and friend and deserves to know everything stand out. The film's cinematography is absolutely outstanding. Bhansali peppers it beautifully with his rich & fairly well informed vision of the 18th century India. Replete with complex war scenes, panoramic action sequences, enthralling songs, though-provoking dialogues & continuous interplay of light & shade coupled with the clamour of swords & tinkling of anklets – Bajirao Mastani is a complete audio visual treat. Speaking of the performances, Ranveer Singh nails it as Bajirao. From a proud Maratha general to an intoxicated lover guilty of cheating his wife, Singh breathes life into the character. The forever stunning Deepika Padukone lights up the screen as the fiery Mastani who disregards all social norms and believes in writing her own destiny. But somewhere, the intensity in her character is missing & she fails to create an impact. Her style of speech becomes monotonous after a time. Also, the full-blown passion of this pair is missing from the picture. It is Priyanka Chopra who takes the cake here. Her Kashi is grace personified. The transformation from the innocent, vivacious & loving wife to a more mature, muted yet strong lady is flawless. She portrays Kashi's inner turmoil with élan & conveys the quiet sorrow of a wife & friend forgotten. The supporting cast has also done a fabulous job – supremely good Tanvi Azmi (as Radhabai), intense Vaibhav (as brother Chimaji) & restrained Milind Soman (as the faithful Ambaji) were a treat to watch. Though the story ends on a tragic note & the ending could have been more authentic and less dramatized (as far as Mastani's death is concerned), it is surely one of the most well scripted scenes in the film. Bajirao, hallucinating under fever, sees forces charging at him in the river. He wages his own war & goes into the water swinging his sword . He says his opponent is 'bhagwan kismat' thus signifying his lost battle with his fate, family & the custodians of religion. From Rao's slow descent into madness to Kashi watching him helplessly to Mastani's failed attempts at freeing herself from the chains that bind her, you can feel their loss, pain & grief. As the sun sets and the rain pours down, it draws the curtain on a 300-year old tale of love 'jiska zikr na kabhi itihas mein hua na kabhi woh udharan bani'. No running across green meadows, no car chase, no item numbers – Bajirao Mastani takes you to a new world full of untasted delights and does complete justice to its theme 'every religion teaches love but love has no religion and is a religion in itself'."
