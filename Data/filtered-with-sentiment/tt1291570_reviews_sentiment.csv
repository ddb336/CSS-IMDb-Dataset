" The movie works. Bad reviews expected something else
",-0.5423,0.9987,2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"I usually don't watch a movie unless I know it will be great or I find it interesting artistically. Only exceptions, when I watch one with my kid. That said, I decided to give this one a chance because of Anthony Hopkins (my favorite actor), Colin Farrell and the thought I would quit before the first 15 minutes anyway. It had bad reviews, after all. But we also know we cannot trust Rotten Tomatoes or critics the way we used to thanks to Disney and Star Wars and politically charged reviews. Also, it was suggested as a free movie through Plex (first time for me), so why not trying what that Plex thing was?I will not summarize the movie. You will have other reviews that will serve that purpose.The performances are good. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is really charismatic and he sells you this movie as a nice tv show episode that happens to feature a more interesting character played by one of the greatest: Anthony Hopkins. He is the one who guides the audience and eventually becomes the main character. When Colin Farrell shows up, the movie earns double the voltage and interest. Colin and Hopkins. They are truly thrilling together. Jeffrey Dean Morgan has good scenes with Hopkins as well. They have a nice, natural chemistry. The movie makes some choices you might not embrace artistically or weird script twists that don't satisfy fully, but in essence it will entertain you and leave you with some existential and moral questions. This movie does not have a lot of artistic ambitions, apart from images of visions. It doesn't try to bring the intelligent conversation. It is not pretentious. It just hits some good notes and serves the purpose it aims to. It is like a less stylish version of Se7en with a more straightforward technique, and a not that evil or conflicted villain.Now, let's talk about Abbie Cornish. I see some reviews criticizing her acting. First of all, she is absolutely stunning. The movie (director) knows how to exploit her beauty and obvious appeal. Her character plays an important part as a sort of co-protagonist, actual secondary character + McGuffin that leaves you thinking about what you are supposed to get from her. In my opinion, she delivers. She does not show the caliber of Colin Farrell or the veteran wisdom for natural-feeling underplaying as Anthony Hopkins, but she is good enough for her role. She doesn't try too hard. She is all right and she shines as both bad ass and fragile.The chemistry is good with the pairings. You can believe what you are seeing. What else do you expect? It is not horror. It is not that suspenseful. It has some well staged action scenes. It's a cop thriller drama. It has good, controlled sentimental scenes. At the end of the day, it works. Enjoy it."
" Underrated thriller with cool abstract cinematography
",0.4019,0.5631,2021-03-13 00:00:00,7,"This is a decent thriller,a mix of seven,you dont know jack and Medium,a serial killer movie with a philosophical angle.As a serial killer/cop movie it is a very standard one,what makes it stand out is the cinematography,this movie has some really hauntingly beautiful images that are both evocative and spine tingling.
The acting is overall pretty good especially Sir Hopkins and Colin Farrell.
The drawbacks are the overly sentimental parts of the movie that are kind of cliched.
There is a bit of a twist at the end but I think most people see it coming."
" An Interesting Thriller
",0.4767,-0.191,2021-02-25 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this film. It contains the usual exemplary performance from Hopkins and is aided by a good cast. I was disappointed when the killer enters the fray but he was excellent ( no hints ). The plot surrounding psychic ability is of course questionable but it adds a different feel to the usual task of finding the serial killer. I recommend it

" Good story, but...
",0.4404,-0.6902,2021-02-21 00:00:00,6,"Good story, could be a good thriller, but it's not. There are moments in the movie that it sounds and resembles more of a CSI / Tv show / B rate action movie
Psychic powers mixed with some sort of telepathic comunication between mediums?!
Good story, not the best acting due to some bad lines on the script, movie gets saved, of course, by Hopkins and in some way by Farrell.
Really bad soundtrack.
Rewrite the story, get Hopkins on board, choose a new director."
" Almost Flawless
",0.4601,0.9074,2021-02-16 00:00:00,9,"I really don't understand the type of person who wouldn't at least enjoy this movie let alone love it. But I'm sure there are some who will nitpick or over-analyze & try to tear it apart. Don't be that guy/gal.The actors & acting were all on point & I think they literally picked the perfect cast for just about every part from the main stars to the character actors & bit part players. It all just worked. I may be a little bias on one hand cuz I love crime movies with suspense but At same time don't feel like I am cuz I've seen some pretty bad ones or ones that didn't do it for me.
At the very least, I can't foresee any1 other than the hardest of hardo's coming away with that sometimes thought of, ""I am never gonna get those 2 hours back"". Majority I'm guessing will be content with having seen and checking it off"

The plot first seems interesting, but in 20 minutes already we know a name of the antagonist and as he looks, and through his 5 stupid and senseless motives.

" Above Average supernatural/thriller
",0.0,0.9715,2021-01-18 00:00:00,7,"There are so many hybrid movie categories these days. I had my doubts but with Sir Anthony in it I figured how bad could it be? That turned out to be true but it's more then that. Shall I spoil or not? That is the question. Sure , some....
Sir Anthony is a retired Doc that happens to have psychic abilities. He's pulled into service by a cop that needs him and it turns out the ""bad guy"" is also psychic, but to a much higher degree then Clancy, Sir Anthony's character.
The story is very layered. Colin Farrell as the killer with unusual motives and turns in a really strong semi-star turn, an unusually interesting type of nut job that might not really be a nut, but have the clearest vision of all.
And this leads to the final twist ending that lets you realize that Farrell knew what was demonizing Hopkins all along, and the deeply implicit similarity between the 2 psychics, and leaves you wondering if the killer's final suggestion to Hopkins might even get carried out.
It seems to start a little slow and for awhile has a low budget indie look,
and made me wonder what Anthony was doing there, but it keeps picking up and getting more layered and interesting at a rapid rate. It has a few new twists and something like a surprise ending and several things that could be called shock scares to keep you jolted in.
I gave a quick look at headlines of reviews here and everything looks pretty favorable, so all is right in the movieverse,. I figured IMDB would average this in the low sixes, but I'm not psychic, I think it deserves 7 or a little more, good performance and a clever reworking of elements we have all come to know so well."
" I wish it was darker

" Solace in letting someone go
",0.0,-0.6407,2020-11-20 00:00:00,9,"Some reviews compare this movie with The Silence of the Lambs or Se7en..but that's not true for me.
Yes, in all of them they search for a killer. Only where Silence is a thriller
and Se7en tries hard for drama Solace is even more into the meta-level of is it right to play god and be judge and executioner.
The whole movie is dominated by the performance of Hopkins and Farell.
With the use of flashbacks we see into the past and possible future.
To tell more of the plot would ruin watching it. Just don't expect a full gung ho action movie.
For me it is a must see movie."

" Interesting plot...
",0.4019,0.9664,2020-07-09 00:00:00,5,"""Solace"" is a Crime - Mystery movie in which we watch a psychic helping the F.B.I. to find a serial killer. His work is very difficult since the serial killer knows more than they know and understands even more.I liked this movie because it was interesting, it was full of mystery and it had much of suspense. The plot was not boring and it had some plot twists that made it even more interesting, I also believe that this movie is a bit underrated because is being compared with some other movies which have some similarities. For one more time Sir Anthony Hopkins who played as John Clancy was simply amazing and he did his best. Some other interpretations that have also to be mentioned were Jeffrey Dean Morgan's who played as Joe Merriwether, Abbie Cornish's who played as Katherine Cowles and Colin Farrell's who played as Charles Ambrose. If you are a fan of mystery movies then you should definitely have to watch it and I am sure that you will enjoy it very much."
" Disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.3182,2020-06-25 00:00:00,5,What a disappointment. What a waste of a brilliant actor.
" Spirit of the 90s in 2015 - Waste of Talent and Time
",0.1779,-0.9955,2020-06-21 00:00:00,3,"It¬¥s a shame somebody was able to attract lots of talented actors (and quite some money) to turn a very flat, clicheed and uninspired script into a movie. Furthermore, the director makes his movie even more unwatchable by relying solely on flashy, shaky camera effects (and very drab, dull photography) which he thought were stylish, but they only make this boring mess more confusing.The beginning is interesting, but of course the basic idea is nothing new. Right after the second murder (the woman in the bathtub) the script completely looses focus and we are thrown into a muddled and unfocused mixture of a unanswered serious topics (Is mercy killing murder?), pretty pathetic clairvoyance mumbo jumbo and routine car chases, gunfights, explosions etc.Since every character is so flat you wonder they even have a name, dialogue is sparse and the general mood is one of depressed lethargy, you are very relieved when the somewhat surreal and pointless (but deliberatey ""meaningful"") last scenes are finally over.The only lively scenes were the sex scenes connected to the bathtub murder, as we get very hot and steamy gay (and straight) sex thrown into our faces for not much of a reason. (Who was the actor who plaid Davids lover btw?) Since everything must lead to cancer, hereditary diseases or other tragedies in the curiously nihilistic worldview of this movie, the scriptwriters just dished out another flat stereotype and portrayed the affair as some sort of HIV related death sentence. The interview leading to this ""confession"" by the husband David was equally cynical, as the clairvoyant would not simply stop at the fact the husband was having an affair and wanted to leave his wife, but turned the whole thing into some sort of confession of a shameful secret (he runs away with another guy) which inevitably had to lead to the death of everybody by HIV (in 2015?!).I wondered whether the script was actually quite old, maybe from the 90s, as it had the same cynical, misanthrophic but very superficial quality a lot of other thrillers had back then. If that¬¥s true, they just should have left it in the drawer."
" good acting in a compelling story
",0.5859,-0.6444,2020-06-18 00:00:00,7,"F.B.I. Special Agent Joe Merriwether (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) calls upon an ex-colleague, Dr. John Clancy (Anthony Hopkins), who is retired, to help him catch a serial killer.Clancy lost his beloved daughter to leukemia and as a result is retired and somewhat isolated. He is a physician - but more important to Joe, he is a gifted psychic.When Joe introduces his partner, Katherine (Abbie Cornish), he sees her in the future with blood on her face. He then decides to help. But Dr. Clancy soon realizes one thing: the serial killer is psychic also, and it doesn't seem to him that his own abilities are going to be very helpful.Excellent acting from all parties, particularly Hopkins, as a man destroyed by his daughter's death. In flashbacks, we learn more of what happened during her illness - and why he may have something in common with the serial killer.Thought-provoking story for sure."
" A nice, enjoyable movie
",0.6908,0.9515,2020-06-05 00:00:00,6,"The movie had potential, it started strong, had a good story going and 75% of it was really good, but in the last part of the movie, somehow everything went downhill. Don't get me wrong, Anthony Hopkins acts beautifully as always , but somehow the end seems rushed and not in place with the rest of the movie and also the acting of the other two ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Abbie Cornish, especially) is just awkward and hard to watch. They don't do a good job at being "" FBI agents "" mainly and everything just seems, goofy.
All in all, i still liked it and recommend it. If you don't have anything to watch and you are in the mood for a crime / mystery movie, just give it a shot."

",0.7615,0.9611,2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,"Hopkins and Farrell can see the future, Morgan and Cornish definitely can't. There's a serial killer on the loose and the law call in a specialist with abilities to track the killer down. It soon becomes apparent that things aren't going to be as easy as first thought. An intense crime thriller which surprised me as it crept under my radar. Dark, gritty and clever with a few twists and turns thrown in for good measure. Enjoyed and would watch again."
" A Convoluted, Artful Film
",0.0,0.9915,2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,"This psychic mystery crime thriller offers up the ultimate in moral ambiguity. It turns the traditional crime thriller on its head along with elegant photography in an attempt to distinguish itself and stand out from the popular crime genre of films. Instead of the precision and smooth, fast-paced Michael Mann's Manhunter (1986), Solace takes its name seriously and tries hard to offer its audience with a beautifully, artful storyline with a slow unmasking of a series of perfect crimes with a baggage of psychological conundrums.In this movie it becomes hard to distinguish between good original photography and artwork and clich√© copying. In Solace the numerous selection of photographic shots appear to have an extra effort to select artistic scenes from a sun sparkling alongside a home's roof, a configured pipe of a home, the brief image of a sunbaked city skyline, lights dancing on a rain-wetted car, a brief image of a screen door that focuses onto investigators seeking answers to images such as the horrific phantasmagoria of The Cell (2000) , Stanley Kubrick's stark images of The Shining (1980) or Lars von Trier's scenic brilliance in Melancholia (2011).Yet it is the underdeveloped and clich√© of the all too easy relenting acceptance of Anthony Hopkins getting involved that makes all the creative photography suggestive of imitation. There's the inaccurate use of the phrase ""split personality disorder"" (as opposed to ""dissociative identity disorder"") and the inclusion of the typical fast food vendor ploy of supposedly cute misdirection of an eating establishment that both further suggest a lax and imitative use of literary license. At the same time, when Anthony Hopkins asks, ""Can I touch her?"" or how the FBI enters a room with their guns ready, the psychic images are quite penetrating, striking in their presentation with a subtle visceral dramatic impact. But again the crisp, continuity and clarity of a psychic vision is so striking that it seems to be more artsy-influenced than real as such psychic phenomena are typically portrayed and thus ironically destroying the illusion of reality and the audience's full acceptance of the storyline.The introduction of three principal investigators in this movie unlike the traditional two makes for a hefty screenwriter and directorial burden to execute well. It's hard enough to focus on the good character vs. bad character dynamic. Additionally, each character seems to also have their own relational issues that the movie attempts to incorporate more deeply into the movie that intrudes on the primary focus on the main plot of crime solving. In Manhunter, the simplification of the number of characters allows the scriptwriter and the audience to easily but more importantly experience the evolution and interaction in more depth in the time allowance of a film's typical duration. Seven (1995) is an excellent example of a crime thriller using two principal investigators. Unlike an ultimate crime movie such as the lengthy Godfather (1972), Solace is handicapped in being able to fully provide the extended rich character development that the experimental quality of the script deserves along with Anthony Hopkins as an executive director providing the heavy weight substance.As with Manhunter (1986), In Solace early on there are similarities to the seeking out of a retired law enforcement specialist who is reluctant to get involved. The meticulous appearance of law enforcement protocol and the effort on authenticity of search tactics and dialogue is quite impressive. One supposes that an FBI consultant was used and to the extent possible followed in the filming and screenwriting of this movie. This element really does stand out among crime movies and but then there's the inexplicable escape act that just doesn't seem to add up except for its requirement to satisfy the movie's more fanciful storyline. The movie then descends into a more mundane chase scene with psychic elements that really don't have the same resonance as the rest of the movie. Nevertheless, there is the underlying, hidden superior element that with some refinement to the script like Alien (1979) and its hidden tantalizing beast could have made this movie even more potent and compelling. The screenwriter or director appears to have overextended themselves and wanted unnecessarily the whole kitchen sink in this movie and the commendable effort to push the envelope of criminal action psychic phenomena almost succeeds but its presentation is so blatant, unlike the belayed and intriguing unfolding of the true criminal.Anthony Hopkin's continued reticent or reluctant behavior to openly reveal what his visions are telling him eventually seem to ring untrue, especially as his by now sidekick, an supposedly decent investigator, appears to be unable to observe that something is wrong or at least he avoids to directly inquire into these obvious lies when it comes to what Hopkin has experienced. There's Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Joe Merriwether and his own physical condition that doesn't seem realistically portrayed or at least the most effective revelation that can be offered in the movie. The movie at times seems to border of becoming a glorified soap opera.In Manhunter (that also happened to portray a earlier version of Hannibal Lector played by Brian Cox a role that Anthony Hopkin who reprise later) there's a man in black hoodie that seems very suspicious as we have here in a boyfriend interrogation. The boyfriend's acting performance is both over the top but at the same time quite distinctively wrenching in a good way. Yet this scene also seems quite manipulative in order to maintain the progression of the storyline as the boyfriend's involvement seems specious from the beginning as even the reveal is offered up before the interrogation. Later a boy's father is portrayed as emotionally distraught, a bit more so than in traditional movies. Again this wrenching facial agonizing presentation is both ""dramatically"" heightened and yet poignantly intimate, a film pushing the limits of visceral tolerance, acceptance, and unintentional parody. Then there's a brilliant scene that quietly explodes by Hopkins and the script that reveals the powerful and tragic confluence of religion, science, medicine, and death as he confronts the parents of their murdered son. And yet, this scene is followed by more intangible silent secrets by Hopkins almost it seems forced upon him by the machination of the script or even the powerful antagonist of the script that fascinatingly appears to even manipulate the scriptwriter and a portion of the movie almost seems to descend into a two-dimensional soap operatic drama. And yet again there is an underlying substantive layer that keeps faintly appearing that suggests that this film isn't just a normal, flat, rip-off, there's more substance and thought-provoking elements at work here and raising some fascinating and important ethical questions with a supernatural twist.
Overall, Solace is operating at a higher qualitative level with its photography and convoluted script which for the most part is carried off quite well. It probably deserves a second look to really get a better evaluative perspective."

Quite beautiful, actually - almost dreamy.When I saw the trailer and then went into this movie, I never expected it to take me on an emotional journey - as it did - as well. This is a brilliant script various people will relate to on different levels. It carries a lot of emotion and delve much deeper than I could possibly have imagined.I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters and their back stories. The film also boosts very good editing, a great score and soundtrack, and fantastic acting by the entire cast. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as always, and perfectly cast as psychic John Clancy. This is one of the most amazing films I've seen in a while. Every aspect of 'Solace' was incredible, but it definitely will divide opinions on the matter at hand. Fascinating!

In the end, only Abbie Cornish did stand out from the mud of a boring story line and more boring direction. The story is absurd, but we have seen more absurd stories create brilliant films only because of script writing, editing, acting and direction. In this instance, it could never staged that tension and nervousness it so desperately tried for. May be however an one time watch for the movie goers like myself, but you'll do yourself a favor by not expecting a lot from this one."

" JUST OKAY - (5 stars out of 10)

What if it meant you had to commit terrible wrongs to accomplish your act of mercy? That is the subject explored in this unremarkable film by director, Afonso Poyart - starring Anthony Hopkins, Colin Farrell, Abbie Cornish and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.When FBI Special Agent, Joe Merriweather (Morgan) shows up on Dr. John Clancy's (Hopkins) doorstep asking for help with a string of serial killings, Clancy faces a new kind of test to his psychic powers. Something he's never experienced before - the scheming and plotting of another psychic. One who is always one step ahead of them during their investigation - someone who has seen the future and who is leaving a trail of bread crumbs that will lead them down a perilous path to a final confrontation which cannot be avoided and which seems destined to be. For our reluctant psychic doctor, this particular case hits close to home as he is taken back to the time when he lost his own daughter in death.The strength of this movie lies in the story. Not the script, mind you, but the actual story. It was one of the more original ideas I've seen in a movie in recent years, and because of the premise, I was drawn into the film. The problem here was the execution, the rather mundane and serviceable acting (especially on the part of Colin Farrell), and the low production values. The pacing was pretty good, and they do a fair job of keeping the intrigue up - but overall, this was a forgettable viewing experience. In fact, as I was watching it, I realized that somewhere along the way, I had already seen it but had actually forgotten how it ended. Yeah, forgettable.This was a ""just okay"" movie. One I have no plans of ever seeing again, and one I cannot recommend. Anthony Hopkins is an amazing actor, but even he seemed to be out of his element here and non-caring about his role. He got the job done and that's about it. This is a pass unless you have a couple of hours to kill."

In this case Hopkins, Dr. Clancy, with psychic abilities, comes out of retirement at the request of a close personal friend with the FBI to help with a serial killer. Clancy uses his mystical psychic abilities to tie the murders together as mercy killings/euthanasia for terminally ill individuals. Clancy realizes that his opponent is also a gifted psychic and both play chess mind games against the other as they consider endless possibilities from a given course of action. Lots of twists and turns typical of Hopkins style movies... Worth the watch..."

I doubt for a minute if I should watch the movie but then I came back to my senses and realized this reviewers don't know anything and are reviewing in base of their one experiences, jealousy, traumas, culture, fame, controversy, etc.

I enjoyed the concept of multiple outcomes based on the ""butterfly effect"" and how they were presented.Giving bad reviews based on it being written by a man (yes there are a few) or similar nonsense is just wasteful.

" Psychic vs Psychic In A Movie That Presents A Relevant Ethical Dilemma
",0.3818,-0.9851,2018-09-15 00:00:00,7,"It's a very interesting take on what could have been a fairly routine (and thus, rather dull) plot. There's a serial killer on the loose. The FBI can't make any headway into figuring out who he is or how he selects his victim, so they call in a psychic (with some past trauma of his own revolving around his daughter's death from leukemia) to help them out - and the psychic figures out that the serial killer is another psychic who kills people that he knows to be suffering from terminal illnesses to spare them from a painful death. One interesting angle to this story is the whole question around so-called mercy killing. Was there any legitimacy to the killer's belief that killing them quickly with a minimum of suffering was better than leaving them to a long and horrible death? How do we define quality of life? Is it anyone's right (other than that of the afflicted perhaps) to actually decide such a thing? So there are some interesting ethical questions that this movie raises, but the hook is the whole psychic vs psychic angle. Even if you have a psychic on your side, how do you get ahead of a psychic killer who - because he's a psychic - is always one step ahead of you? It's intriguing.I liked the cast in this. You really can't go wrong with Anthony Hopkins, who plays the psychic who consults with the FBI. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Abbie Cornish were the FBI agents he was working with and Colin Farrell was the serial killer. Of the four, Cornish is the one I'm probably least familiar with, but they all offered good performances, although I thought that the ultimate fate of Joe (Morgan's character) was a bit too convenient, given the overall message of the movie. But overall I thought this worked well, up until the last 10 or 15 minutes. Once we really got into what you might call the battle of the psychics the story became a bit too chaotic, and rather than being drawn in by the psychic chaos I found my attention starting to wander from what was happening on the screen.The title of this movie, of course, is ""Solace."" We get an on-screen definition of the word as the movie opens. It means of course something that eases disappointment of grief. Clearly, based on his past, it was John (Hopkins) who needed solace. Did he find it? We discover at the end of the movie why he's so tormented; why this case is so close to his heart. Did he come to terms with his daughter's death - and, more specifically, with how she died? Was he able to move on? Maybe. It's left as kind of an open question - hopeful, but with no real or definite resolution to that part of the story, which was perhaps appropriate. After all there are a lot of ethical and moral questions that remain unanswered - which is why we continue to ask them.Overall, this is a well done movie with an interesting premise. (7/10)"

If I see one more female detective dressed like Olivia Benson on SVU I'm going to scream just for lack of creativity. Do all female detectives wear low-cut tank tops with big belts and a tight blazer? I just could not believe this character and it ruined the movie for me. I did continue to watch it though because Anthony Hopkins was just so good. But the writing was worse than general TV crime procedurals. Just so many tropes and mysoginistic lines and visuals. Ugh. Really too bad - was just on the edge of being great - if they could've just had one rewrite from a female writer, and someone down to earth like Gina Rodriguez in the main female role to make it more believable, It could've put it over the edge."

" Sad descent into special effects work
",-0.1027,-0.8826,2018-03-22 00:00:00,5,"Watching SOLACE, you feel like you're taking part in a WALKING DEAD cast reunion, with seemingly half the actors from that show turning up at one point or another. The lead is none other than Negan himself, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, playing an FBI agent on the trail of a serial killer whose method is to alleviate the lives of those living in pain. In a plot that feels more than a little copied from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - albeit with a supernatural twist - he calls in retired psychic Anthony Hopkins to help him out. What follows is occasionally shocking but more often than not predictable, as Hopkins uses his super-senses to close in on the enemy who is always one step ahead. Colin Farrell eventually shows up as the villain in an underwhelming performance, and there's an occasional surprise twist that works well. However, SOLACE is spoilt by the breakdown of the story in the last third, with things descending into 'mannequin challenge' style special effects and even a little MATRIX-style 'bullet time'. I found this rather disappointing given the careful set-up of all that came previously."

This movie did remind me of Seven, Manhunter, The Dead Zone, etc but this psychic versus psychic is a cool idea & both are played by A-list actors. It's stylish, often brutal, well acted & has a good musical score. The only minor quibble is that it does push the boundaries of believability towards the end. 
Looking at other reviews it is a classic case of IMDB exaggeration - to award this 1/10 is simply absurd, but likewise only the best movies deserve 10/10 & this certainly is not one of them. But I enjoyed it , 7/10 from me."

pretty good.
When I seen this I thought this is a damn good movie with a good
story and really good performances.The film is basically your typical serial killer goes on a rampage and
FBI agents must stop him formula, but this film is refreshingly done
with great twists and takes interesting turns along the way.The performances from Anthony Hopkins, Colin Farrell, Jefferey Dean Morgan
and Abbie Cornish were very good, everyone brought their A-game in this.
Jefferey and Abbie play FBI agents and Anthony is a doctor who is physic
who from what I can tell, is a cop, and the FBI uses him from time to time
on really difficult cases. On this case, the killer there after is just like Anthony's
character, a physic ,and has them follow his bazaar riddles and clues, which is
really cool.I know it won't happen but I kinda want to see a sequel to this because the
concept is fresh, this film could be a franchise. Originally this was the sequel
to Seven that started Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt but was changed to
this instead, I think at the time New Line Cinema didn't like it or it never got
of the ground, but I'm glad it was rescued and made as this instead. Besides
Seven is very hard to franchise if you think about it.The action scenes are good and the story is cool it's one of these edge of your
seat kinda flicks, with a great ending that I will not spoil. 
I give it a 7/10. A good movie that I can't recommend enough to you. See it."

" Psychic Tete a Tete
",0.0,-0.9707,2018-01-13 00:00:00,4,"Solace: Directed by Afonso Poyart. Written by Sean Bailey and Ted Griffin.Solace is one of those relatively high concept serial killer thriller that were pretty popular for a while in the 90s. Anthony Hopkins plays a psychic doctor who is helping a detective friend of his attempt to solve a case where the killer is almost perfect in his ways. This killer is specifically targeting people who have either terminal illnesses or severe suicidal tendencies. This had a decent enough hook to at least want to know where this is going. This is painfully by the book though. It hits all the cliche marks right down the line. Sometimes this is not something that will kill a movie. But the movie must have style to supplement or fascinating characters. This does not, this has the type of people you think they are with the shadowy tragic backstories you know they have from the very start. Both Anthony Hopkins and Jeffrey Dean Morgan play their parts well. They are believable as long time colleagues and friends. Anthony Hopkins is always watchable. His performance elevates the portions that he is in but there is only so much he can do. The biggest issue this movie has other than the nonsense psychic tete a tete going on between Anthony Hopkins and Colin Farrell is the camerawork and the atrocious editing. There are cuts everywhere, some of which were disorienting. It made things hard to follow and it was generally incredibly irritating. It ruined the tension anytime it tries to bring into the action or meat of the story. This is a miss for sure. It had potential to take the premise in wild and crazy directions. To have fun with it. It does not. Instead it labors in dull meandering threads with no idea how to get from one point to another. It attempts to amp up tension with extremely cryptic imagery and inane editing. I would say to skip this one. I give it a D."

That's it really.Anthony Hopkins leads a cast who are not in the same league as himself, and it clearly shows. Despite that, the script doesn't often help, and the director is clearly out of his depth with this one. So much could have been done.What should be a taut storyline, really isn't. The premise of psychic cops and villain, doesn't ever convince or leave on edge, and there seems to have been soft porn takes added in as it would be the only talking point for some, and kind of devalued the film. It never added to anything.It's not by any means the poorest movie you'll see of late, but it's one that one will best be left for late night satellite film TV stations as a filler. Nothing more.

It's virtues are not obscured by it's flaws, far from it. An interesting and original narrative gives us a very watchable take on the police procedural/serial killer genre.

I just finished watching this movie and cannot understand the negative reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent watching. There may have been a few slow moments but all-in-all it was very entertaining; i.e., intriguing, suspenseful, well written and acted, etc. If you do not believe or are at least curious about psychic abilities, why would you have watched it to begin with? A number of movies are similar in slight ways but to me it did not occur to me while I watched this one. I see no similarity to Silence, Dr. Letter was not psychic but brilliant. So glad I flipped upon another movie with the phenomenal acting and presence of Sir Philip ""Anthony Hopkins""."
" Hopkins chases Farrell in an uninspired & implausible mess of a thriller
",-0.2732,-0.9784,2017-09-15 00:00:00,3,"The screenplay for ""Solace"" became a stand-alone movie after it was reject by David Fincher as a proposed sequel to ""Se7en"", called ""Ei8ht"" (is out there a more ridiculous / forced title for a sequel ?). Well, Sir Anthony Hopkins, unfortunately, stopped cared or he's becoming senile to executive produce such a far-fetched & implausible script that could have been an acceptable B-movie, if it wasn't directed in a serious tone like if this rookie director would think he was making a new ""Se7en"" or ""The Silence of the Lambs"" for the 'millennials' standards. I don't know why in the hell Hollywood is still hiring those Brazilian directors and give them millions to helm a big studio's production like this. Jos√© Padilha killed the ""RoboCop"" franchise with the atrocious remake, and now Afonso Poyart delivers one of the worst psychological thrillers ever produced. The direction is so damn 'flashy'; it lacks tension and atmosphere required for such a mystery / thriller film; the composition of shots is nothing sort of spectacular, even if the director is trying too hard, visually, to innovate the genre. The camera tricks added in post production became so repetitive & annoying that it looked like we're watching a cartoon-ish or a sci-fi / superhero movie shot in ""The Matrix"" style. The supporting cast delivers terrible performances, Abbie Cornish can't act as a F.B.I. Special Agent even if she was possessed by one, and not because of her Barbie looks, just check the ""Criminal Minds"" T.V. Show and the actresses play their parts with much more authenticity. I don't know if Jeffrey Dean Morgan was jinxed or is just because his acting skills are limited and he just can't lead a film. On this account, for every theatrical released movie he was in, it's either from terrible to utter crap or a box office flop. He needs to stuck on TV Shows such as ""Supernatural"" & ""Walking Dead"" and quit cinema for once. The only positive thing about this mess of a movie were the performances from both Anthony Hopkins and Colin Farrell that always delivered the goods in every role they were in. Hopkins is so typecast in this particular parts that he can do it with charm & confidence, even in his sleep and Farrell is convincing & leave a mark in the film, besides his limited 'less than 20 minutes"" screen time as the morose serial-killer. Their scenes together were very good and both have great chemistry on-screen that deserved a way better movie. Verdict: as a psychological thriller it fails in every department: it takes itself too seriously; the screenplay is full of bad written dialogue delivered even worse and the premise is risible to say the least, it earns maybe 2 extra points for the performances of the two protagonists."

Anthony Hopkins character is a psyche and he chases another psychic who appears to be even better than he is. This is the climax of the movie. In the end, the audience is left with one impending question: was the perpetrator really a criminal or more like a super-hero with mercy for the victims who had terminal illnesses, suffering and undeniably short-lived lives?This movie has a lot of flash forwards - which is opposite to flash-backs which show the actors in their past historical memories. The flash forwards are captured by the camera in an array of multiple screen sequencing and representing the future and psyche visions.There is a minor conflict between the good psychic and a police officer who is a psychologist. However that conflict is quickly overcome when the good psychic, Anthony Hopkins, takes a liking to the police psychologist. A friendship develops putting all conflict aside."

Striking home hard is his rational for murder, as even I now write, Britain's Charlie Gard case is being settled essentially, in cold blood. (His parents want to get their baby on life support even if it means they have to leave the country, while the British court system claims superior custody, refusing to let the child leave with his parents and deciding for little Charlie that death is in his best interest. The court appointed lawyer assigned to the family is advocating ""death with dignity""). So, much like Terri Schiavo, their child has been court ordered off of life support illegalizing any other recourse for these voiceless victims of the system. Charlie is on course to become just one in what is becoming a rapidly growing number of mercy killings. Only this is not that system. Colin Farrell sums up this mentality in a perfect performance. Calm, cool, patronizing and chillingly real. Anthony Hopkin's intuitive investigator acts as an odd counter and book end both echoing and reflecting Hopkin's Oscar winning role as Hannibal Lecter in 1991's 'The Silence of the Lambs'. His performance here makes this a notable and necessary film in the collection of any true Hopkin's fan. This movie merits itself as an invaluable statement regarding modern thoughts on murder. Cast has good chemistry and stays engaged in the narrative and the score is excellent.In his demonstration that death can either rankle or silence, one wonders to what extent Hopkin's personal exploration meant to touch on Hannibal. Hopkin's art has evolved in exploring what mercy killing means at the start of the film, and what it means at it's finale revealing the depth of Hopkin's skill as an actor. The cathartic understanding of death Hopkin's possesses, embraces, shares and realizes seams to be that death is not only an inevitable part of life, but is perhaps the one thing in life, only, that could not possibly underscore any further the importance of living life to the very fullest, in all it's mud and glory. Mercy's most overlooked and critical feature is the ability of mercy to overcome the tragic. Here death becomes THE redemptive feature of a life well lived, instead of a frightening alternative to human suffering. As such, death becomes a choice that cannot ever be chosen by one human being for the other. Death is intimate. Personal. Once choosing death is seen as an act of compassion, it quickly turns into a habitual feature in the minds of the self-righteouse... who then become serial killers. Charlie's much publicized situation is meant to establish the value of ""death with dignity,"" in England, the most disturbing feature, least of which is being one's own right to choose life over death in favor of another's right to choose for the same death over life! And as I edit this, little Alphie Evan's murder in the name of ""dignity"" becomes increasingly inevitable. Solace explores the senselessness of death, how death looms over all, and that life is both precious and short in an overall FU to the character and mindset of all the Hannibal Lecters of the world, whether a beurocrat, a serial killer or both."
" Decent but could have been better
",0.5927,0.9357,2017-07-11 00:00:00,5,"Solace tells the story of a psychic retired FBI agent (Anthony Hopkins) helping out solve a case about a string of murders. The premise and overall synopsis of this sounds like it could be a really good and intriguing film, but what it becomes is only decent and somewhat feels as a TV series. Hopkins is good in the role, as he has played many times before, he isn't the problem. Colin Farrell playing the killer, is advertised much such as his face on some of the posters but hardly appears (he comes in much later) and when he appears elevates the film. Solace is quite entertaining but just not executed as it could have been, with better writing they could have added a clever twist which was thought that would appear from little clues, but what is left in the end was quite a disappointing finale."
" A very good film, but could have brilliant
",0.8072,0.6068,2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,"This film was great---but sadly, had the makings of a brilliant film had there not been a lot of problems with post production and supporting case.Hopkins and Farrell are GENIUS in their roles, and had we seen more of them, and gotten into their story more, this would have been even better. However, I think many scenes were lost in editing, which is a shame because the other supporting cast cannot stand up to them. And it shows. Both of the actors who play the FBI agents are weak, and their lack of ability shows, ruining the pacing and general feel of the film. Farrell and Hopkins end up saving this film, which is obvious every time they are on the screen. It's just a shame they didn't devote the storyline to them both and dropped the excess that throws the films pacing off.Despite this, it's visually amazing, captivating and intriguing--- and there is a double twist that gets you right at the end.The sad part is, this film doesn't really know what to focus on: The thriller part of psychic vs psychic or the moral subplot or the FBI hunt, and it does get a bit garbled in the process in regards to pacing.It's still great and I highly recommend it."
" It's got style up the ying yang
",0.0,0.9736,2017-06-10 00:00:00,7,"Serial killer films are a dime a dozen. Literally, you can't browse ten titles in a thriller subcategory without running into at least, like, three. Within this ever popular area, there's also the 'psychic assisting law enforcement to catch a killer' motif that pops up now and again, more so on television than film, but it's there. Solace takes a crack at that, and speaking of that particular idea, the first thing I was reminded of was NBC's Hannibal. This is one stylish flick, in the same way the series is abstract, using sharp, slow motion close ups paired with crisp audio to create a surreal image of something mundane, clues in a seemingly innocuous environment. Anthony Hopkins plays the clairvoyant here, a guy with demons in his past who sometimes consults on cases with his longtime FBI friend (a haggard looking Jeffrey Dean Morgan). There's a new killer in town, town being Atlanta, one that causes Morgan to drag him out of consultation retirement and have a go at the case, along with his rookie partner (Abbie Cornish, turning in one damn fine performance). Not all is as it seems here, and when the murderer does finally show up it's clear that he isn't your garden variety serial slasher, and has an agenda that goes deep into some moral issues, the one place where the script strives for depth beyond the procedural template. He's played by Colin Farrell of all people, which is a perfect example casting against type that works. Usually it'd be some sinister looking character actor or genre snake playing the role, but by giving it to a leading man of Farrell's caliber, they've achieved some gravity, and he's brilliant. Now, this isn't what I'd call a great film, it has it's inconsistencies, multiple snags in pacing and one convoluted plot for the first two acts. But it's quite the fascinating effort, one with a dense, thought provoking story to tell, every performer pulling their weight impressively. And like I said, there's style to go around."
" clunky cop drama despite the superior actors
",-0.431,0.9493,2017-06-07 00:00:00,4,"FBI agents Joe Merriwether (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Katherine Cowles (Abbie Cornish) are hunting a serial killer who stabs his victims in the back of their necks. Despite Cowles' reservations, Merriwether recruits psychic Dr. John Clancy (Anthony Hopkins). Clancy is still suffering from his daughter's death. He sees visions of the victims and the future. He is haunted by visions of Cowles' death. Soon, he realizes that the killer (Colin Farrell) also has the vision but he is much better at it.This starts as a clunky police drama with a supernatural addition. It's a little false and nothing better than any random TV cop show. The supernatural visions are stylized and a bit cheap. Then Farrell shows up around the midpoint. Farrell and Hopkins have a fun energy. They have great chemistry. There is a special effect of their powers reminiscent of Nicolas Cage in Next. Farrell being more powerful leads me to consider switching the two actors. It would make more sense for the ending. It might be better to drop the cops into secondary roles and abandon the lifeless cop drama."

Making the Unbelievable Believable is a Fine Line that has to be Straddled just so, and in this one the Script and the Director Go Way Too Far.For Example, when Anthony Hopkins lets loose on Abbie Cornish and Fires Away on the Details of Her Life in Excruciating Detail, Things come Unglued and We're Off to Complete Fantasy Land. Jeffrey Dean Morton's Character is Overwritten, as is Most of the Story.The Same can be Said when Colin Farrell Shows Up, just for the Third Act, He too knows way More than Anyone on Earth could Possibly Know. This is the Type of Thing for a Horror Movie (read Devil or Angel) and Not a Serial Killer, Psychological Police Procedural Thriller. It is Extreme Genre Hopping that Does Not Work.Overall, the Movie Looks Great and has a Surreal, Colorful Template and some of the SFX are Cool. Worth a Watch for the Visual Vista and the Star Performances, but the Move as a Whole is a Huge Disappointment Considering."

If you do, you will enjoy the surprising ending; you may figure it out before hand, as I almost did towards the end.

",-0.6486,0.1408,2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed by this one... The story and the idea had potential, and Anthony Hopkins was great as usual. The main reason for the weak score would be the acting of the 2 main characters, Jeffrey Morgan & Abbie Cornish, but especially Abbie Cornish. I think that the fact that she was trying so hard to control her Australian accent just made her performance stiff, unnatural and unbelievable. I didn't know she was Australian, but I noticed her accent was weird, so I literally had to pause the movie to google her and then it all made sense. Maybe if she would have been allowed to just speak naturally, this whole film would have been much better."

Certainly would have made it's money back and more. Today?? VOD.So what happened? Too many movies coming out in the theaters to make room for this one? Too many showings of ""Beauty and the Beast"" taking up ten cinemas or more in the multi-plex thus shutting out ""Solace""? Fear that Americans would not know what Solace meant?? Think I am kidding??Back when Dalton played Bond the second feature was to be called ""License Revoked"" but was changed to ""License to Kill"" because the studio feared too many Americans would not now what revoked meant!! At least the Bond folks decided we were not all idiots and eventually gave us ""Quantum of Solace""! (See?

Didn't take long to see that it had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of his movies. Anthony Hopkins acting is just embarrassing. I invite anybody who says otherwise to review your idols. He's an amazing actor, he is. But in this he is just absolute rubbish. It's sad, really - it seems like he doesn't trust the director. It gets to a point where in an (supposedly) sad scene, he playfully pats a kid as the kids goes past him during his own father's funeral procession. Who the hell let that one go by...Anyways - if you're looking for something good, don't bother. If you're looking for something that really marks the directors or either one of the actors careers, don't bother.

So many issues I do not know where to begin but I will say that the director left so many options to make this a great movie but just left huge holes in the scenes wow so bad. My shock at how poorly the female lead completely failed to act up to the level of the male leads. She was just not here for her job when this was filmed. What a waste.

What a ride. Fast paced and non stop. Not a movie with great depth but it wasn't meant to be, it was meant to just be enjoyed in a wild ride. Don't over think it, just enjoy. Abbie Cornish doesn't really have the chops to carry next to Mr. Hopkins but honestly, who does. Not a strong actress but comes along. I found her accent slipping from time to time. Should have just let her go with her natural Australian accent, but whatever. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, just adorable and perfectly cast as a scruffy cop. Colin Farrell, still has that perfect bad guy psycho eye that we all love. He will never go out of style. Finally, a little flash of Janine Turner, she never ages. Not a good casting choice as Anthony Hopkins wife though. Little bit of a yuck factor there. What a surprisingly good movie."

This team has no clue who the Serial Killer is and the only thing they know is that all the victims had a disease that would have killed them soon anyway. The Serial Killer is always one step ahead of this FBI team and Dr. Clancy admits that the Serial Killer is also a Psychic and is far better than he is. I would have thought that the FBI team would have made a list of the victims' friends and known acquaintances to see if someone on the list knew all the victims.

She, by the way, is poor and very two dimensional - as is the script.

" A Different Kind of Cat and Mouse
",0.0,-0.802,2017-03-03 00:00:00,7,"A psychic doctor, John Clancy (Anthony Hopkins), works with an FBI special agent (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) in search of serial killer Charles Ambrose (Colin Farrell). After having lived in isolation for two years, since the death of his daughter, Clancy is asked by his friend Joe, an FBI special agent to help him solve several murders committed by a serial killer.First of all, the casting of Anthony Hopkins is a bold move. While Hopkins is a great actor and makes any film better by his presence (including this one), in this case he is also a liability. He is serving as an unorthodox source for the FBI to help solve a serial killer case. Obviously, this calls to mind ""Silence of the Lambs"". And by doing so, the film gives itself a bar that no one could possibly reach.The concept is great, especially once the twist is revealed. It blends the thriller, the mystery and the supernatural elements very well. Much of this is ruined, however, by some really sloppy camera work. The view shakes, shifts and zooms in a very rough way, and is quite distracting. I think I understand why this decision was made, but it was the wrong decision. A simple tripod with proper framing would have made this a potential blockbuster.Interestingly, the marketing and promotion seem to play up Anthony Hopkins and Colin Farrell, while leaving out Jeffrey Dean Morgan. This is strange, considering that Morgan is the lead actor for most of the film. It is further strange considering how he is now the most-loved actor on ""The Walking Dead"" (besides Norman Reedus), and it would make sense to sell this film with those fans in mind. There is no doubt some overlap in the target audience.All in all, though, this film is a winner that seems to have gone under the radar the first time around. Don't let it pass you by on home video. The Blu-ray, out March 2017 from Lionsgate, contains an informative commentary with director Afonso Poyart and the featurette ""Visions and Voices: The Making of SOLACE""."
" What's the hell is not to love when Antony Hopkins is involved, huh?
",-0.8388,0.9944,2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"It's awesome. I'm not overreacting i swear, you just don't get it! This movie sums up four of my favorite foreign movies and series; The German Movie ""WHO AM I"", The American TV series "" Hannibal"", The Korean Drama "" I Remember You"" and finally The American movie based on true story ""You Don't Know Jack"". Let me explain what i mean.First of all, it has something from the German movie ""Who Am I"" even if it's just the name of it, you have no idea what happened to me when i saw the ""Who Am I"" letters written in the beginning of the movie. ""Who Am I"" is one of the most beautiful, epic, amazing and greatest movie ever!! ever! If you haven't seen it yet, you must die or must watch.Secondly, it has a common idea with ""Hannibal"", the American TV series not the movie. I don't wanna say the story of it but briefly, Anthony Hopkins in ""Solace"" plays a similar role to that of Hugh Dancy in ""Hannibal"" the series not the movie, again. ""P.S: Anthony Hopkins stars as Hannibal himself in ""Hannibal"" the movie, but please don't get confused cause i'm talking about the series not the movie. Forget about it"".Thirdly, The roles of Anthony in ""Solace"" and Hugh in ""Hannibal"" are the same as Seo In-Guk, the Korean actor in ""I Remember You"" the Korean drama, the three of them have a mutual role which is a psychological ability that they refer to as ""interpreting the evidence"". Talking particularly about Anthony Hopkins in ""Solace"" and his ability, it's that He sees things, predicting things and even knew things that happened in the past by touching stuff, people or visiting a crime scene and recreates the thinking criminal of serial killers who is Colin Farrell that also has the same ability of Anthony Hopkins which makes it more interesting and thrilling.Fourthly, It shares an important idea with ""You Don't Know Jack"" an American movie starring Al Pacino as Dr. Jack Kevorkian, based on true story and by the way the real Dr. Jack Kevorkian died 6 years ago in 2011, he was a pathologist who assisted people suffering from acute medical conditions in ending their lives. He spent eight years in prison after years of conflict with the court system over the legality of his actions that spurred national debate on the ethics of euthanasia and hospice care, and there's a video on Youtube of the real Dr. Jack in court discussing his case. I think it's with a Portuguese subtitle but you gotta watch it. Anyways, Colin Farrell in ""Solace"" has the same concept of Dr. Jack Which is the ""Mercy Killing"", besides Colin Farrell's physiological ability that also Anthony Hopkins has in ""Solace"".Finally and to sum up my review, i'm not overreacting, it's just that i liked ""Solace"" because when i watched it i felt like i'm watching my 4 favorite movies and series all in one movie with a very good scenario, i loved the filming, the editing and the music, everything was just PERFECT. The story keeps your attention focused up to the very end. Hopkins' performance it stunning, Farrell is brilliant! They both deliver as well as ever. Abbie Cornish is awesome and i don't know how it gets only 6.5 on IMDb, it should take 8.9 at least. Anyways, if you're gonna see it, try to find an edited version with some few scenes been cut. Oh and one more thing, What's the hell is not to love when Antony Hopkins is involved, huh?"
