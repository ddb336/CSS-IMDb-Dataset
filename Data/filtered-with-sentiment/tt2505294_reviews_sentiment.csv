" Where is the ending??
",0.0,0.6956,2021-03-26 00:00:00,5,"A story has to have an ending. This film is 99 percent exposition. We get to know the character, Britt Robertson on every level. She is developing herself. She is learning and growing up and then we are left like her mother with nothing. She is not using her credit cards so what happened. The low ratings are justified. A great developing story has to have more than some folksy song to end it. The fault dear Brutus is in the writing. The acting by Robertson is tops. But give the story an ending!"
" A great solid performance and film
",0.6908,0.9942,2020-12-22 00:00:00,7,"I've not read the book but I know the story so well. Many actresses have performed the same story many times over the years,
Britt Robertsons is most enjoyable partly because she has an intelligent and mature relationship with the camera and therefore us.
She doesn't seek to hide or act, she seeks to be what she is supposed to portray and I think her for that, because I believe 100% what she is saying and acting on screen.
She is authentic in that she is not scared at all of appearing in scenes with not so much as a lick of make up. She doesn't need it having natural good looks but she doesn't need it because she is also confident in herself. Just as she is in her acting. Perhaps it is her confidence that allows her to explore her inner self to inform and underpin her acting?
She reminds me sometimes of Hayley Lu Richardson, another fantastic actor who gives an honest and authentic performance and more often than not in indie films rather than mainstream goop.
I think it is only a matter of time before Robertson secures an oscar."
" Not what I expected
",0.0,-0.4214,2020-12-02 00:00:00,6,"I wasn't to sure what to expect with this movie, but I wasn't expecting this. I thought it would be something light and fun. I figured it would be about a girl exploring her sexuality or trying to make some extra cash by being an escort. Instead I was faced with a very serious film about a coming of age story. The film is very relatable and realistic but also dreary as you watch the character go through the pains of life and deal with her issues. I would have somewhat enjoyed the movie, but the ending killed it. It made things even more confusing. It would have been okay if it was a true story, then the ending would have made sense, but no where is it stated that this is a true story."
" ENDING SUCKS
",-0.3612,0.705,2020-10-13 00:00:00,7,I just read some of the other reviews and I guess this was based on a true story. I gave it a seven because the acting is great and the script is great. But the ending just ruined the whole movie for me. It's sad that this thing really happened I guess. It's definitely a movie worth watching but like I said for me the ending really soured the whole tone of the movie.
" A movie about mental health
",0.0,0.0276,2020-09-13 00:00:00,8,"A lot of reviews on here don't quite understand that the main character is suffering form a borderline personality disorder. Symptoms include emotional instability, feelings of worthlessness, insecurity, impulsivity, and impaired social relationships.This movie explores how some people lie to both themselves and others and manipulate the truth when dealing with BPD. Notice how all of the characters from her blog were different in both attractiveness, success and names at the end. It is very hard to distinguish reality from imagination for many dealing with these types of mental health issues."
" Not sure who the target audience is
",-0.2411,-0.0387,2020-08-26 00:00:00,2,"It's too adult for kids, but it's too teen-y and annoying for adults. It does have good acting, but the entire story is listening to a naive, morally lacking teen girl talk about what she's blogging. I struggled to care about the hobby of such an unlikeable main character."
" Ending ruins the movie completely
",-0.4404,-0.837,2020-01-12 00:00:00,5,"I have never seen a movie with a worse ending before in my life. The ending is so annoying and dumb that it makes me angry just thinking about it. The last 5 minutes of the movie make the previous 90 minutes absolutely meaningless. Don't watch this movie if you want to see a movie with a good ending. I wish they did a rewrite and reshot the ending. Britt Robertson is great in her performance, but the ending will make you frustrated."
" Her age

" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.9843,2019-10-17 00:00:00,9,"I love well done teen angst movies. Even though I'm 69 I feel 20 inside and can relate to much of what is called teen angst still to this day.However, this movie is something different all together. Reviewers have said the basic plot, the great acting of Britt, (and I mean great acting) and the confusion of the ending. But to me the ending was what the movie was all about.I went into this thinking like others it would be a rather light hearted teen angst comedy. And that's what it mostly was. Except it wasn't. First, as others have pointed out, Britt brought a gritty realism to the role that was really refreshing. Superb acting for me.But more importantly, through the whole movie I felt this edgier, almost spooky context under the surface. For some reason I expected something bad to happen, like when she went to see Sheen, a sex offender, and he locks the door. Or when kissing Slater on his birthday I expected the wife who was in another room to walk in. A strange tension was simmering underneath the movie and it was intriguing me. And when it got near the end and it looked like a fluff ending in the works I still felt the tension. And then the real ending, and all of a sudden it all made sense. Kinda like a dream within a dream.Absolutely brilliant."
" Identity Politics
",0.0,0.12,2019-09-18 00:00:00,9,"She disappears because, as engaging as she is, she has no identity. She has been given none by her family, which has disintegrated. She is a useful object to others, though they would not admit that even to themselves. And her online / imagined persona is a fiction. Who is she, or might she be, really ? How would you know ?"
" It would be a horrible movie if it wasn't so accurate.
",-0.5423,0.9001,2019-09-14 00:00:00,9,"This movie is truly one of the most accurate descriptions of what it's like to be a teen girl/woman in America. If you don't like it, maybe it's because you are either lucky enough not to relate or you're a creepy man who sees himself in one or all of the male roles in this film. Either way, learn some empathy and help take action to prevent the silencing of women."
" This film is a gem that has been hidden!
",0.0,0.9549,2019-07-10 00:00:00,10,"First, the movie poster and the trailer make this appear to be a light teen rom-com with a salty twist. It is NOT! It is deep, dark, funny, intelligent, surprising, incredibly well acted and directed, so completely more than the impression the studio and release gave it, that it has been done a great disservice. It's worth the time and emotional investment."
" waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.9658,2019-04-03 00:00:00,1,Good movie all the way through but such a bad ending so I guess not all the way through. It was not even a good bad ending where I can recognize the it as a solid ending. no this was garbage. it made me so angry i made an account to write a review.
" Interesting Film
",0.4019,-0.892,2019-02-21 00:00:00,7,"At first this film felt like your standard teen dramedy, but as it progresses it starts to become much more. You learn Katie was molested as a child and it gives some insight into why she makes the relationship choices she makes. You later learn she becomes pregnant and she has no idea who the father may be, as the list of suspects includes Long, Slater, and her of age boyfriend. She confronts her former boss at a book store she worked at (Sheen) with news of her pregnancy, who offers to house her and raise the baby himself in an attempt to steer her away from getting an abortion.At this point the film wraps with its ending, and also a dark turn. We suddenly divert from Katie's world to a woman named Carol speaking, who is the mother of Amy Grantham, who we know as Katie. Carol reveals her daughter took a phone call one night from a blocked number, got in her car, and was never seen or heard from again. She then pleads with the audience for any information which could help lead to her daughter's whereabouts. Also in Carol's monologue are details of Amy's real life which are different from Katie's, such as Long's character not being a college professor but rather a video store manager. In addition the Spooner family disputes any sexual relationship between Katie/Amy and Paul and Sheen's character denying ever offering to raise her child. A really weird ending.Admittedly I was thrown off by this, and immediately had to go to google and read other reviews of this film to confirm that Amy Grantham is not in fact a real person and the entire movie was 100% fiction. I endorse anything that rattles me and makes me start incessantly searching the internet for answers which is why this is the first movie in a while I watched more than once. The reviews for this movie were mixed, with some calling the ending stupid and predictable, but from my end this was something I hadn't seen before, and anything that makes you feel a plethora of emotions is something I fully recommend. I gave this movie 7 out of 10 stars on imdb. Thanks for reading!"
" Wickedness is a terrible trait
",-0.7351,-0.781,2019-02-11 00:00:00,9,"He movie is wonderful, delighted me. He is full of instruction for those who look at him. However, if you try to identify with the main character and understand it completely, it is shocking and unambiguously sad. Why? Is this a punishment? So life can be a lot worse and harder than her. I am a man and in the flourishing of my youth I have experienced the horrors of war. I fought for the right thing, the freedom of my people, for the family, for the children who were killed every day in this or that way, the one that hit me most. The war has passed, I survived, the consequences remain in us, on us. I felt married with the love of my life, that I have a wonderful son I worship and who would give my life as much as I love him. Many who have been with me in the fiery line have not experienced it, every day I'm sorry. So many happy moments, I mean those when the tears go from happiness. Do not we live for just those moments? No one knows what his end will be, who he deserves !? It is a terrible thing to do, whether something bad has to happen to someone, and if someone else approves it, as if it deserved it, because it was such or such a thing, it did this or that. No, we do not need anyone to judge! Who dares, who do you take for the right? It is tragic to have this and what is unfortunately about us.We must all work in our surroundings to make it less and to condemn such things and there will be less suffering and pain. We are just passers-by in time, let's leave something ugly or beautiful in our memory of those behind us. Your choice! I choose good! Love is wonderful! People love it, everything goes quickly, it's time to take advantage of it. Damir from Croatia! P.S. Sorry in my bad English."
" PEOPLE WITH LIVES DON'T BLOG

She opts to take a year off to figure that out, a year that really messes up her life. Katie writes a blog. She changes names and details, i.e. the people we see are those that she blogs about. She likes older men and sex in general and has no trouble cheating on her 15 second boyfriend (Max Carver).Katie is a confused person who goes from being tough to very sensitive. She believes that people who have lives don't write or read blogs (Phew! I that they were going to say Amazon reviews.) In the middle of film she gets a note from her boss on the ""10 Basic Truths of Life."" These are things we all know is true about life, but never want to admit. I found some of them interesting and none I would totally disagree with, if I decided to be truly honest.The ending of the film was a total surprise. My first impression was ""Is this based on a true story?"" Second impression, ""They didn't know how to end it."" and third impression, ""Oh I can see this is where they were meant to be.""This is perhaps a hip ""Lifetime"" type film that would have massive teen girl appeal.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Britt Robertson, Gia Mantegna)"
" I think I know where she went
",0.0,-0.9451,2018-08-10 00:00:00,7,"This movie was fine, not amazing, but not a waste of time. I didn't really like the main character but that's just because of the many poor choices she made, plus I hate home wreckers and cheaters. But the storyline was great.Okay so remember when she wrote that letter to the guy who molested her when she was little? I feel like she put her number at the bottom of the letter, so for some reason he could contact her -as she was a pretty confusing and brave character. 
I wouldn't be surprised since she went back to the sex offender book store guy, watched him close the blinds and lock the door and still didn't feel uncomfortable or scared.
Anyway so I think he may have called her, and offered her money or place to stay in order for her not to tell anyone about what he did? I don't know, just a guess :)"
" Nothing like you expected!

You need to see it! I promise you will not regret it."

Along the way, the viewer discovers, through her revealing blog entries, that she was molested as a young child, which has tainted her present relationships. She then finds herself pregnant. Based on the book, Undiscovered Gryl whose author wrote the screenplay and directed the movie. Robertson was phenomenal. Worth catching."
" Good movie with an excellent ending
",0.765,0.9985,2017-11-05 00:00:00,6,"Most people loved the movie, but hated the ending. I thought the movie was interesting, but the ending was really outstanding and raised the level a lot. I'll try to explain why.The movie is about a young, promiscuous girl with a difficult childhood, alienated by her dad, developing a crush on one older man after the other, and at the same time being fresh, confident, conflicted, immature and smart. It's a pleasant watch. The ending however really got me, because it made me realise that everything previously shown was merely her version of life. All the people according to her presentation were beautiful, interesting and funny, played by outstanding actors. Regardless whether the character was likable or unlikable, all seemed really vivid and special.When the reality was presented, it was grey and bleak. The people in her life were regular, some even appeared like dubious creeps. This is an important moment. The man in the bookstore was initially some wonderful, warm person, full of understanding and wisdom. In reality he gave the impression of a guy, you'd better not come near to at all. Her best friend Jade was gorgeous, sassy and funny, but in reality she looked like a junkie hooker. People often do not perceive reality objectively, but through a lens that makes it more like they wish reality was. The ending was the wake up call and I highly appreciate the director's decision (who's also the novel author) to take this approach.6/10 for the story and 10/10 for the ending"
" Unexpectedly deep movie
",0.0,0.9683,2017-09-26 00:00:00,10,"(*WARNING: May contain spoilers. If you didn't see the movie, don't read the review until after you've watched the movie. Also, trigger warning for sensitive subject matter.)Well, THAT was deep! Initially I didn't pay attention to this movie other than seeing my Mom watching the film but I kind of wrote off ""AMA"" as being another rom com. Until now anyways.Tonight I sat down and turned on Netflix and, after watching the trailer, decided to give ""AMA"" a try and I'm glad I did. This movie exceeded my expectations and what starts off as a light hearted sex and coming of age movie turns into a deep, thought provoking study in *spoiler #1* the deep toll sexual abuse takes on the survivor years later. Katie (played by an excellent Britt Roberson) was a character that fascinated me; Katie was witty, snarky, fragile, sarcastic, free spirited, troubled, complicated and complex all at once. Katie can frustrate and confuse you just as she can make you feel for her and relate to her. And Katie was a young girl with enough flaws as much as she's got emotional wounds, and while she made some reckless and destructive decisions, in knowing that Katie was sexually victimized as a child, you understand her. Britt totally carried the entire movie with her performance; she didn't so much play Katie as she was Katie. And everyone else from Christian Slater, Kimberly Williams- Paisley, Justin Long, Martin Sheen, etc. gave equally great performances that kept me engaged with the movie from beginning to end, and I really admire the way the movie approached the topic of sexual abuse/molestation with enough sensitivity without being too neat and enough frankness without being too gratuitous and exploitative. We need more of that in modern day cinema. Now, onto discussion of (warning: spoiler #2): the ending. The ending really threw me for a loop and I was so taken aback that I needed to rewind so I could watch the entire scene without missing anything. Seriously, I did NOT expect such a bleak, heavy, haunting and rather unsettling, ambiguous ending. It's as if the movie did a double whammy in first removing any signs of regular rom com/coming of age and turning that into a deep study of the affects of sexual abuse, and then turning that into what could be a cautionary tale. What really adds to the shocking quality of the ending is that after (*spoiler #3*) Katie/Amy finds out that she's pregnant and just when she's coming into a maturing sense of awareness in growing up, finding closure in dealing with sexual trauma and moving forward in her life, BAM--the ending comes and, for me, this ending left me questioning everything that was shown. Now I will say that Katie/Amy's story was valid since her Mom did confirm that most of what she said was true, just with certain details added and altered, and names and identities changed. Yet I also do believe that someone who knew Katie/Any may have taken her. Could've been Justin Long's character. Could've been Christian Slater's character. Could've been the ex boyfriend. Could've been anyone, and the ambiguity of the circumstances leading up to Katie/Amy's disappearance, which person that could've taken her and even Katie/Amy's fate is what's unsettling. That actually makes me sad, worried and scared for Katie/Amy.The ending caused mixed reactions: some people loved the ending, some people were annoyed by the ending. I thought the ending was effective. In fact, you can say that the movie can also be considered a cautionary commentary on modern day millennial's obsession with the internet as well as searching for love, attention, adoration, notoriety and fame on the internet and the dangers and consequences thereof, which is just as super important and actually mandatory to address now in this day and age.Overall, this indie movie is a masterpiece and now a favorite in my movie collection. My rating and vote is an A+ and 10/10."
" Better than most coming-of-age flicks.
",0.4404,0.9329,2017-08-10 00:00:00,6,"I don't like Britt Robertson at all. She's as interesting as a brick. If you look at the list of her movies (and series), you'll find next to nothing of any depth or quality. It's mostly melodramatic, shallow, formulaic crap. This little movie is undoubtedly an exception, which cannot be ruined even by her bland acting.The movie's full of little gems, unusual little sentences in conversations. It feels rather authentic than schematic. The supporting cast is pretty good, diverting from the fact that the main character's not all that special. It's more the situations the character gets into and the people that cross her path, inadvertently having an impact on her. I imagine the director and writer, Alison Burnett, used some of her own experiences for this. This being her directing debut, I think she did alright. She managed to use her inexperience as a director to her advantage, giving the film an amateur feel, which kind of added charm and authenticity to the mix. The ending might be confusing to say the least, definitely different, and different is always good in my book. It gives the viewer some space to interpret, imagine or even understand. 6.4/10"
" Showcase for Britt Robertson
",0.0,0.9865,2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"I like Britt Robertson for all the right reasons. She is beautiful, and extremely talented. This movie, however entertaining, is really a showcase of Britt's talents. She truly 'lives' this role.I realized her unique acting talent years ago in ""Dan in Real Life"", where she plays the middle daughter of Dan. I knew she was going on to bigger roles, and a successful Hollywood career if she wanted it.In this movie aimed at the adolescent audience, she plays a confused teenager writing a blog revealing her daily activities and secrets, advised to do so by her high school guidance counselor in lieu of moving onto her first year in collage.The main issue that Robertson has had to deal with in tinsel town is the fact that she is typecast as a teenager roll after roll, even though she is getting close to 28 years old at this writing. In the 2015 feature film Tomorrowland with costar George Clooney, she plays a high school student as well.If you like Britt Robertson, or if you aren't aware of her yet, and you want to see someone ""nail an acting role"", I strongly advise this movie. However, if you are a prude, or someone that has hangups about a young woman walking around her house in panties and a t-shirt, please pass on this movie, and go see a shrink."
" Completely waste of time!
",-0.5244,-0.7177,2017-01-28 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Total loss of time! The film itself is bad enough, showing the ""difficulties"" experienced by an inconsequential and promiscuous teenager, raised by her mother and stepfather, apparently ""good people"", but who have no idea of ​​the irresponsibility of the girl. The girl has the body and appearance of a child, but maintains a daring sexual behavior, which in my opinion is a kind of stimulus to pedophilia. And at the end of the movie, they spoil the plot once and for all, by adding scenes simulating ""real facts,"" adding new characters, and a perspective that the girl would have invented most of the story and vanished after the supposed events. I felt like I lost 2 hours of my life with such nonsense. I'm just missing a little more writing this text to help someone who decides to research a little before watching."
