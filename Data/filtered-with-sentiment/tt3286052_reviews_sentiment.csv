" I get it, I just can't see the point
",0.0,-0.6815,2021-04-11 00:00:00,2,"To all the reviewers helpfully explaining what happened in this movie and why it's great if you understand it: I understood what was going on, I just thought the film was pointless and poorly done. I enjoy slow-burn storytelling, but when the ""twist"" is obvious early in the movie, slow-burn just becomes slow. I get the need for an atmosphere of dread, but when every freaking scene, including outdoor daylight scenes, is so dark that you can't see what's going on and the music is so intrusive that you can't hear critical lines, that's just poor technique. Trying to be arty doesn't make art."
" Stretches...
",0.0,0.9353,2021-04-01 00:00:00,6,"I liked a lot about this movie. It had a creepy score. Nicely shot. Pretty good acting. Really good brutal violent killings that made me wince.Here's the thing though. I had this thing figured out as soon as the father told the girl that her she had lost a daughter nine years earlier. And here I was shaking my head, saying to myself ""yeeeha, right..."". I'm sorry but I have a hard time accepting that a teenage girl would rather be possessed by the Devil than have to live without her parents. I guess Satan got his rocks off in the end by abandoning her but... I dunno. I just kind of found it to be a pretty far stretch. Maybe if they threw in some more detailed flashbacks of her bonding with her newly adopted foster dad... and by that I mean Satan. Just give me a sequence of her chumming up with the devil, then I'd actually feel sorry for her when she's left abandoned at the end. I'd also be more creeped out. Instead, Osgood Perkins just wanted me to believe something I find to be pretty unbelievable, at least in the story world he created. Just one guys opinion here. It's really the only flaw I saw in the movie. I still enjoyed it, but the ending had me shaking my head. It felt like a lazy and rushed ending. Give me that flashback sequence. Help me suspend that disbelief. I felt the same way about the ending of Gretel & Hansel. It's not ""original"". It's unbelievable. If he learned how to wrap up your plots a little better and I'd be giving you 10s rather 6s because his films are quit beautiful to look at and have great creepy moods. This movie kind of feels like a 5000 dollar bicycle but it has one big ugly ding in it."

" Kiernan belongs in cinema.
",0.0,-0.763,2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"This very creepy movie owes much to the
striking presence of Kiernan Shipka. The film itself is very eerie & should be considered among the recent wave of horror that is actually scary & unsettling like ""Hereditary"", ""Wounds"" & the ""Suspiria"" remake (the latter two proving Dakota Johnson will outlive ""50 Shades"" & have a great future in film).
Kiernan is not only frightening but haunting.
She would not look out of place in an eerie
60's Hammer film, a 50's film noir or any
type of genre film through cinema history.
If the right directors see this film, she will be
the biggest film star of her generation."

" Bleak, chilly, and disturbing
",-0.5106,-0.9813,2021-03-16 00:00:00,7,"The Blackcoat's Daughter is a flawed movie. But it stuck with me in ways that technically better horror movies have not. It's a well-shot, well-acted movie about grief and loneliness. Ultimately, it offers very little hope. I didn't like the feeling it left me with. But I can't say that's a demerit.As to the flaws, it's difficult to get into those without spoiling the plot. The biggest problem for me is a particular casting choice; ultimately it's a cheat, but given the film's structure, it has to cheat to work. I guess you could call it a necessary evil.I'm discovering that, between this and Hereditary, I don't like movies about demons. They get under my skin. And I'm not even religious."
" Original, Haunting Movie
",0.0516,-0.7814,2021-03-05 00:00:00,8,"This one stuck out to me. It demonstrates the flaws in Hollywood's disrespectful attitude regarding horror. There is significant character development and temporal complexity in this film, with an underlying motif that I have never before seen in horror. It's about time people see that horror can be a platform to portray intricate interpersonal networks and interpersonal struggle. This film is certainly a step in the right direction. I am tempted to give this a 10 because I can't recall anything I found wrong with it, but I try to reserve that for films that are undeniably among the pantheon of cinematic megaliths, which this is not."
" Absolute rubbish
",0.0,-0.8261,2021-02-28 00:00:00,1,"This was one of the most horribly written, horribly acted movies I have ever seen. Complete and utter crapfest!"
" Terrible writing.
",-0.4767,-0.9798,2021-02-22 00:00:00,2,"I feel like the best horrors and thrillers are the ones where you really get into the protagonist's head and can feel that sense of terror and fear that they're feeling. This had none of that.Kat's transition into becoming possessed... was not there. It just happened. We barely linger around her character or *feel* anything. She and Rose never formed any kind of bond, or spent more than a few minutes together. We didn't truly get to watch Rose become afraid of what was happening around her. Her death was sudden, and extremely predictable. No suspense, not once. Nothing to feel.Also, whatever possessed Kat, there's no backstory to what it is or why it claimed her or why it needs these people dead and to have their heads.Rose's parents acted... weird. Especially her mother. There was something eerie about them but nothing came of it. There was supposed to be something ""shocking"" about them unknowingly helping their daughter's killer but it just wasn't enough of a twist. And their demise seemed kind of abrupt and silly.The whole film just felt very lackluster to me. I think it would have been good to focus on the two girls a lot more, create a connection with the audience, really zone in on the emotions and of what's happening to them. When Kat finally kills Rose, it should have come as a huge shock/twist and devastated us. They told us Rose was already dead way too soon in the film, and it was blatantly clear who the killer is not long after.I wanted to like the movie. The bit of a sneak peek Netflix showed me looked interesting and I was intrigued by the description. Unfortunately I just didn't enjoy this film at all."
" Awesome
",0.6249,0.5548,2021-02-22 00:00:00,9,Real quick i was bed ridden for 5 years before i had a heart transplant and watched a ton of horror. This movie is one of my favorites and to see that the same guy was involved in The Dark & the Wicked tells me a lot. To see how the girls were so polite and sometimes a little stuckup like young girls can be and then to be so wicked was awesome. Emma was awesome. I truly believed that the girl had a crush on Satan.
" Possessed and then abandoned
",-0.4588,-0.898,2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"It was winter break and the boarding school was almost empty except for two girls; Kat and rose. Rose was dating a boy outside the school and got pregnant. She went out with him and left kat alone in the school. She came and saw her holding a ritual in front of the stove in the basement. The devil told her on the phone that her parents wouldn't be back. The black coat possessed her. She killed the two women in charge at the school and rose too and put their heads in front of the stove like offerings to the black coat. I knew it way before that Joan was Kat. Then kay got shot in the arm and locked up in a psychiatric ward. A priest performed exorcism on her and the black coat left her. She managed to escape with a fake ID (she probably killed a nurse named Joan) and at the terminal she came across with parents of rose. When the father showed her daughter's picture saying they lost her, I thought it's a supernatural flick like there are ghost students hanging around. They helped her get back home and when they were passing in front of the boarding school, she killed both and beheaded them like she did and put them in the luggage. She took them to the basement but the black coat wasn't there and the school was abandoned. She went out and cried because she was abandoned by him. It waa a bit too much of a slow burn at times and too silent and it got me a bit bored but although I saw the ""twist"" coming I enjoyed the last and first part of the movie better than the middle where they just hung around pretty much doing nothing."

But in the same way Hereditary stays with you, so will this film.Giving it a 10 because I want to counterbalance the current rating. Realistically an 8 because it's a simple script that probably could have been a short film, but so much greatness occurs in this minimal runtime either way. A24 always does it right. Hail satan."

",-0.3612,-0.743,2021-02-01 00:00:00,1,"The volume was all over the place (lots of ""what she say??

And I can count the movies I have seen and disliked on one hand. I love horror and I am no movie snob, but this one is a hard pass from me."
" Deedle, deedle, Blackcoat's Daughter, what was in that holy water
",0.0,-0.9951,2021-01-26 00:00:00,7,"February or the Blackcoat's Daughter (I personally prefer the later title as it definitely connects more with the story). Is a very dark and disturbing film that will more than likely confuse you a little the first time that you see it. So you will probably need to watch this film again if you want to get a greater meaning and understanding of it.I'm feeing extremely mixed emotions while reviewing this film. On one hand it is a slow burning horror that captures a brooding and terrifying atmosphere of isolation and loneliness which is fascinating, intriguing and mysterious.On the other hand the ending of the film pretty much leaves the whole story to interpretation. I don't like it, and I personally feel a little cheated. I don't think it rounds out this story to it's deserved closure, on an otherwise gripping and absorbing movie.The film's setting looks bleak and miserable being set in a cold, snowy winter and is packed full of horrifying and ominous moments. While it focuses heavily on it's non-linear storytelling.The Blackcoats Daugher is truly an unsettling film where it captures real and dark emotions. It preys upon many supernatural and unknown themes. The killings throughout the film are very brutal, realistic and nasty.Kiernan Shipka (Katherine) was just sensational in this film. I find her such a talented actress and have been a big fan of hers since her portrayal of Catherine Dollanganger in Flowers in the Attic. Emma Roberts and Lucy Boynton are also very diverse in their roles and I can see them having long and fruitful careers.Kat looks to be an introvert as she has a timid personality and from what it seems like, someone who wouldn't have a whole lot of friends. I feel she is either under the influence from some sort of supernatural entity very early on in the film or she could be just suffering from various mental health issues where she is trying to find a way to help cope with her loneliness?The question the film poses us, does this have more to do with the occult and is there some evil force or 'devil' that stays with Kat throughout the film, where she feels that she needs to gain it's approval by killing, and offering the severed heads of her victims?Whatever the reasons are, we don't get a lot of backstory on so many sub plots in this film. And that's what makes it hard to fully comprehend. Rose says to Kat early on in the film that the sisters at the Bramford school tried to summon the devil years ago. This is never spoken about again. Did it happen? Did she make it up? Did she just plant the idea in Kat's head? It's just an odd thing to say to someone you know little about. Almost like a scare tactic. However, like many things in this film, it's left up to you to decide.There is enough evidence to suggest that their is an evil presence attached in some way to Kat. The film indicates that this is the case as we get flashbacks in the later stages of the film about the bond Kat has shared with a horned shadowy figure that appears in the background, and who has been influencing Kat throughout the story.Another theory I can suggest is some type of mental illness. Kat seems quite obsessed with Mr Gordon, she mentions to Rose that Mr. Gordon wants her to live with him at the school. Kat is also heard whispering his name while worshipping the furnace in the boiler room. I personally think that she almost is desperate for the need of a father figure.Kat sees her father in a dream at the start of the film, and during the dream she sees her mother has been killed in a car accident. Again we have nothing else to go off here as this, like a lot of things in this film is never mentioned again.Furthermore, the only other person Kat seems to have a connection with is another older male in Bramford's school priest, Father Brian. Kat looks visibly upset when he tells her that he is leaving for the school break and is unable to see her performance. She seems to question him that it only takes a couple of hours to get back from where he is traveling to. There is a later encounter between the pair, which is when Father Brian preforms an exorcism on Kat and the horned figure seems to leave her. She begs it 'don't go' which might indicate how desperately alone Kat feels. We can also take note that the 'devil' speaks to Kat on the pay phone and says 'kill all the girls'. And 'you can live here with me'All I can say is that, we just don't know what goes through peoples minds and what they see, hear or believe and that's why if you have an open mind, then I do recommend this film for something wildly different. However, it's not going to be a film that satisfies everyone.7/10"
" No Dramatic Tension
",-0.5423,0.9283,2021-01-25 00:00:00,3,"The acting is fine, as is the cinematography. Production values are high overall. The soundscape is really pretty good, and is the strongest aspect of the film in my opinion. However, the film lacks dramatic tension. It is also hard to follow. The girls look similar and I kept confusing them. The setting lacked orienting detail. The song, in the idiom of a faux trad. ballad, was sloppy in its diction. Love Berry Berenson and Anthony Perkins."
" Less is more in this excellent horror film
",0.2511,-0.9427,2021-01-12 00:00:00,9,"""The Blackcoat's Daughter,"" also known as ""February,"" is a marvelous slow burn of a horror film. Directed by Osgood Perkins and starring Emma Roberts, Kiernan Shipka, and Lucy Boynton, this is a movie that takes it time to draw in its viewers with meticulously crafted framing, tense music, and a brooding sense of unease that never lets up.If it wasn't obvious by my rating, I absolutely adored this film, for multiple reasons; let's start with the acting. Emma Roberts as Joan and Kiernan Shipka as Kat are incredible, giving understated performances that ooze menace, even when nothing particularly scary is happening. Perhaps in one scene Joan will be sitting on her bed, dripping wet and wrapped in a towel, while a man joins her and starts to converse - the synths swell, and Joan looks uncomfortable, and even afraid. And perhaps in another scene Kat is speaking to someone and looks off in the distance, subtly smiling to herself. The moody, dimly lit atmosphere of the film, coupled with the foreboding, tense music and the almost surrealistically bizarre performances set a tone of constant unease; no one really acts like they should, and to the credit of the performers, they managed to consistently creep me out.Lucy Boynton as Rose is also powerful. Arguably the most likeable and ordinary character of the bunch, she still carries enough nuance to make you wonder if she is perhaps hiding something beneath the surface. There is a wonderfully suspenseful scene where Rose is telling Kat a horror story that has been circulating about the nuns who work at the boarding school they are both in. Is the story nothing more than a rumor passed from student to student, is it a form of hazing on Rose's part, or is there some truth to it after all? ""The Blackcoat's Daughter"" demonstrates top-notch acting, each character moment purposefully executed to either set up a question, build suspense, or provide a semblance of an answer, and it's, frankly, masterfully done.The overall look of the film also adds to its unsettling nature. Everything is mildly dimly lit, but not overly. The ground is covered in snow, but not so much as to trap people in a singular location. The school seems dilapidated, but only from the normal wear and tear of time. Nothing looks as it should, but nothing looks too bizarre either - everything from the setting to the behaviors of the characters to the choice of music is just creepy enough to fill you with dread and immerse you in the goings-on of the film.Without spoiling anything, another thing I loved about this movie was its restraint. Its horror is more in what it doesn't show rather than what it does. As such, the viewer is left to answer a lot of questions based on their own interpretation, but not in a ""We don't have all the answers"" type of way. The movie sets up the questions as well as provides the answer, while still allowing the audience to come to their own conclusions.""The Blackcoat's Daughter"" is a fantastic little horror film. It looks visually appealing, is elevated by its soundtrack, and the grade A performances enhance the material and add another layer of unease to the entire movie. This is art house horror done right, and I can't wait to watch this again."
" Requires patience and trust; but worthwhile
",0.6428,0.9849,2021-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Have you seen ""slow burn"" movies that move with a glacial pace and don't tell you everything you'd like to know about the characters or the things they're doing? And then, at the end of the film, your patience is rewarded with nothing? Nothing is more frustrating. At least if a film is fast-paced but leads nowhere, it feels like you got there quickly. But a ""moody"" piece that NEVER pays off is just the kind of thing that makes you want to say ""I want my money and 90 minutes back.""THE BLACKCOAT'S DAUGHTER is a slow burn, a VERY slow one. But there IS a payoff...one that really doesn't all fall into place until nearly the very end. And not everyone will love the ending (and a few won't get it)...but it does have an ending, one that is very neatly both tidy and open-ended. Cryptic yet clear. You can take it at face value, and all is explained. Or you can think about motivations and ""what happens next"" and be left to draw your own conclusions about what it all means.The ""story"", in brief: the film follows two seemingly separate stories. We meet Kat and Rose, two students at a very dreary all-girl's Catholic boarding school. Kat (Kiernan Shipka) is a younger student, while Rose (Lucy Boynton) appears to be nearly set to graduate. When a week long break arrives, these two girls are stuck together, because in both cases, their parents have not arrived to pick them up. So for a couple of days, the two young ladies (who really didn't know each other before) spend more time together than they'd probably like, overseen by two elderly women (nuns?) and otherwise alone in this supremely dark and creepy and dull school. Things don't go well.Alternating with this scenario is the time we spend with June (Emma Roberts), a young lady who is clearly down in the dumps (seriously depressed or disturbed) and is offered a ride and shelter by an older couple (James Remar & Lauren Holly). June barely speaks to them, and is also seemingly wracked by painful flashbacks...brief, disturbing images that have no immediate meaning to the viewer.The mood of the film is relentlessly creepy and full of foreboding. A good example: we don't know if we should be afraid OF June or FOR June (or both). She is clearly a mess. But the couple that ""befriends"" her doesn't always act 100% straightforward; there is something going on there that we don't understand.Back at the school, Rose is dealing with some serious ""guy issues"" and is perhaps distracted from noticing just how much Kat is falling apart. Kat's eyes get more and more sunken. Her gaze grows more distant. She says cryptic things when she speaks at all. And she takes some late night strange phone calls.I don't want to say much more. This is a horror movie because there are supernatural moments and there are also some horrific moments. And from that level, the plot comes together nicely, with some decent surprises along the way. It also becomes pretty violent and while not strictly ""gory"", the violence is very disturbing. On the other hand, there is some psychological depth here, as the film explores the impact of loneliness and loss. The implication is that the supernatural only thrives in an atmosphere of separateness and vulnerability. And that aspect of the film is left more open-ended.The best parts of the movie are the unfailingly creepy atmosphere than director Osgood Perkins maintains throughout; at no time do we feel like we're on firm footing. A sense of disquiet permeates the film from first scene to last. And best of all is the amazing performance from Kiernan Shipka. She was perhaps 15 when she made this film...so she's actually playing her age, rather than having a 22 year old actress play 15. She just comes across younger than the older Lucy Boynton, and that's important. Kat seems like the vulnerable one who really needs some help. Rose, while troubled, is also self-centered in the way that 18 year old young ladies so often are. Boynton is good. Emma Roberts is good. But Shipka is revelatory. (I should also mention that the score is very effective as well.)Less successful is the sound mix. At times, it lends to the foreboding atmosphere, but often, the mix is muddled enough that key pieces of dialogue are missed. We actually turned on the subtitles for awhile, because we could tell something really important was happening, but couldn't understand it. Also, the adult actors are less convincing than their younger counterparts. Most of the minor roles (the nuns, the priest, the headmaster) are not played very convincingly, and Remar (who can be very good) has some dialogue that's a bit cheesy, and he doesn't quite manage to overcome that.But this movie was well worth watching. There were plenty of scenes that just full on gave me the creeps. And the surprise ending (which you may see coming just a little early), is pretty good. It's one of those endings where if you think about what has come before, you see that the movie pretty much gave you all you needed to know already. It comes off as a very ""fair"" ending. It's a very sad film, but I was still very glad to have finally watched it."
" A Slow Boil Of Terror
",-0.5267,0.9798,2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Say what you want about this engrossing, compact little movie from Tony Perkins son Oz but you are wrong if you say it is a waste of your time. This movie is like making a good soup, you put all these spices, ingredients together and let it slowly work its way up to a slow and steady boil! This movie does the same. Oz Perkins, both director and screenwriter, gives you little hints along the way, a wrecked car, a girl on a bus, a grieving man, satanic story, a comment here or there. You must watch, you must pay attention as this story unfolds. What is now and what was then? Who is who? When you come to the end you can sit and enjoy your tasty bowl of good soup.
The acting is top notch, the photography uses light and shadows superbly, almost becoming a character rather than an effect. The music is perfect, sound pitches rather than extended melodies to heighten the drama, the oncoming terror.
The three lead young women are very good. In one scene, Rose, the sensible one if there is such a thing, sits for a school photograph. She walks in with the air of teenage pride, settles herself as if she were Ava Gardner, then her face slowly, confidently, full of sensual knowledge beyond her years and Hope broadens into a glorious smile. Then a flash and the smile collapses instantly into a look of confusion and fear. All with in a few seconds. All with just the camera and Lucy Boynton's fine acting as Rose. You can find such nuances in Emma Roberts as the mysterious and creepy Joan and Kieran Shipka as the very troubled Kat. Again who is who? Where is time in this tightly made thriller.
Well worth your time and brain effort to see this movie!"

Anyway it worked because she was possessed by the Easter bunny. I could plainly see him clear as day standing in the shadows of her hospital room.

" Very complex film, hard to follow unless you watch EVERY thing
",-0.1689,-0.3222,2020-11-15 00:00:00,4,"VERY subtle possession movie. First, if you don't pay attention to EVERYTHING going on you'll miss something that's very important. Pay attention to the faces and names - very important - to realize who's who (especially in a photograph). Second, you need to understand there's three stories being told, each will start with the girls name being introduced (briefly) on screen. Third, each story intertwines with the others. Even then this movie can be hard to follow (especially if you missed two seconds of something important). Still not sure about the folks who pick up the ""hitchhiker"" - maybe you'll figure it out (Ghosts? Family reliving this particular night?). The ""demon"" only shows up as a ""shadow,"" it's not going to be blatantly obvious like The Exorcist. This movie is hard to follow and is a bit disjointed. Worth the watch after you've been through every decently made supernatural film and have run out of options, hence why I watched it. Meh, there's worse... I had to watch this one twice to get it."
" Atmospheric but slow horror film.
",-0.7227,-0.3626,2020-11-02 00:00:00,5,"This film absolutely nailed the atmosphere from the lighting to the sets and scenes in terms of cinematography. The main actresses all played their roles very well and considering I have seen Emma Roberts in other films this comes as no surprise. The issues start to come up in terms of editing where there are certain scenes that were too long and the pacing was extremely slow for the first half of the movie. It was not until the second half where the movie really gets into the meat of the story involving murder, sacrifice and demons etc. In addition, the sound was used too frequently to indicate something terrible or ominous was afoot. Subtle use of this is preferable for an atmospheric horror of this nature. The movie's ending was also kind of sudden and not enough explanation/resolution was provided. The final scene feels like it was just abruptly cut and then the credits roll. 5/10 largely due to the excellent acting from the main cast and the atmosphere."
" cold, slow, not particularly pleasant, but has its merits
",0.3799,-0.2082,2020-10-31 00:00:00,5,"Slow-paced film with a cold atmosphere throughout. I didn't enjoy it much, but it has its virtues. The performances are good, but there is little in the way of action or for that matter interaction. Where characters interact conversation is full of never ending pauses, delays & one word answers. There is a reason for this of course, but it makes for a frustrating film.The final third of the film is fairly brutal, and there is something of a twist, although it's more a question of the narration revealing what it was about the whole time.Much of the film has a diabolical theme, although there is ambiguity here about the nature of the events that happen.As others point out there is something slightly unsatisifactory about the motivations we are given & one of the films weaknesses is, regardless of the nature of the events that happen there doesn't seem enough going on psychologically to get us to the point we eventually arrive at. If this is a tragedy, we never quite get what feels like an adequate explanation of why it ends in the way it does. What explanation we are given seems slightly unsatisfactory.Worth a watch if you like cold, brooding menace, with a putative diabloical theme, but the sort of thing I really care to watch. Also given that this is set in a catholic girls school, a setting in which some have found so much psychical potential, this can't but seem like a missed opportunity of sorts, particularly in terms of atmosphere."

The characters are all unlikable so there's no one to root for. The characters are asked questions and just ignore them, a movie trope that I never see in real life. What ever happened to ""I'd rather not say,"" or at least a shrug of the shoulders. Slow moving movies live or die by the payoff - this one dies. Also Emma Roberts is wasted in a non-essential subplot. There's nuns, cause it's that's kind of movie, but they are not at all creepy or even severe. This may have a limited appeal for someone out there, but it left me cold, and not in the ""blood runs cold"" way. For the record, he does better with his next film as he writes a far superior script. It's still off the slow-burn variety, but it's more effective."
" Why bother?

Even if the movie is amazing from here out, 5 stars is the max it can deserve for wasting an hour my time. The only reason i'm not deleting it unfinished is because i'm stupid about finishing what i start."

Not much good to say about this movie. The actors do ok, considering the badly written script they have to work with."
" A very effective and unraveling horror
",-0.079,0.296,2020-09-25 00:00:00,8,"The Blackcoat's Daughter is a wonderful horror and is deserving of more than just one viewing. The film follows two stories that of Katherine and Rose two students stuck during the dead of winter at their catholic prep school when their parents don't show up to pick them up for winter break while Joan a mysterious young woman makes her way towards this school. The film plays a lot with the passage of time as the two stories we follow slowly trickle out information as to what exactly may be going on while also providing these lapses of information to further the ominous and unsettling elements of the film to keep the audience engaged and guessing. There isn't to much to say other than that as dealing any further information would ruin a lot of the story however the film really comes to ahead with a fantastic ending that culminates the story very well.The performances are all fantastic with our three leads being the highlight. Roberts' and Shipka provide a very cold and brooding portrayal of their characters while Boyton does a fantastic job of playing the ""straight-man"" unknowing of what's going on but capturing the emotionally distraught type very well. The setting and cinematography is very well done the cold winter setting and uniform all setting fits this very unnerving vibe the film goes for. The techniques implored for the camera work doesn't feel modern but very seventies and is fitting for this slow burn atmospheric horror. Overall The Blackcoat's Daughter is stellar with very minor discrepancies towards a few of the editing choices I would highly recommend checking this one out especially with knowing very little going into it. - 8/10"
" Dark, Mysterious and Unsettling
",0.0,0.9117,2020-09-14 00:00:00,8,"This quiet little horror thriller has a fairly simple plot but the non linear story telling makes it like an intriguing jigsaw as the diretor slowly gives you more pieces of the puzzle and allows you to put things together.
While there are only 3 legitimately scary scenes in the film they build on the creepy atmosphere and dark tone to slowly ramp up the tension.
The dialogue is fairly limited and reserved but the cast do a solid job with it, and the soundtrack works well to maintain the unsettling nature of the film.
The synopsis isn't entirely accurate but that's a good thing as it is best to watch this without knowing much. It's a slow burn so if that's not your thing then you may find it lacking but I thoroughly enjoyed it."

Do not go into this story thinking that you are going to watch something that will make your heart beat faster for the entire film. It is more of an interesting slow burn like The Shining, than a creature feature like Jurassic Park.I only found one minor flaw with this film, and that's why I've given it a 9/10.

I enjoy a psychological thriller or even a film with very little dialogue. However, the actors must be able to convey that in a meaningful way and that doesn't happen here. At times the acting is akin to watching an audition tape.Oh and the whole, she was mentally ill, there never was a demand/devil, I could have gotten behind if it weren't for two scenes: where she (Kat) is in the basement and repeatedly bowing to the furnace in a way that is unnatural, she moved at the same speed and ended up stoping in the same spot on both the bow and return up.Also, while Kat is lying in bes that same night she is lying face down under her blankets when her body contorts for her feet to be placed in front of her head.

I have no idea what other reviewers see in this movie, because all I saw was a incredibly boring, cliché possession movie. It wasn't scary, chilling, or even slightly creepy. Just a dull knife and some demonic murders of literally zero consequence. What was the point? There were none the entire time. For a movie that claims to be a chilling, dark drama, i expected at least a little plot, not to mention the acting was horrible and the line delivery monotone. Nothing was there to keep my interest for more than a few minutes at a time. A massive disappointment."
" Well crafted
",0.2732,-0.453,2020-08-17 00:00:00,7,"Again, yet another movie that you have to ignore the low scores on here.this movie's out-of-order telling of the lives of the two girls harkens back to Momento, Citizen Kane, and Run Lola Run. You REALLY need to pay attention, notice things and remember details..
It literally took me until the very last scene (well, at least close to it), during the school photo session to even REALIZE the last piece of the puzzle.
It made the rewatch that much more fulfilling when you ""get it"".The acting was not much to write home about, except the possessed girl. She nailed it.I absolutely LOVE one specific thing. There is NO WAY to do an exorcism movie without being subconsciously compared to the Exorcist. But this one managed to add something to the genre. This demon did what I think demons would do. Use a body until it's job was done then leave. That is what this one did. It did not resist the exorcism at all... despite the girl's pleading for it to stay. It used her and threw her away, dead or live did not matter.
Because it used that tactic, instead of the demon wanting ti stay in the human until it dies, added a new twist that I had never seen before.
Also, making the possession a rather secondary part of the plot was intriguing as well. (yes still a catalyst to the whole thing but the focus was on the girls and the aftermath.)
Good job!"

Okay, whatever. Something sinister going on, maybe getting good. Enter side stage an escaped mental patient who looks like one of the two girls who got left. Weird, but I can roll. Parents of one of the girls who got left behind picks up escaped loonie only to talk about their dead daughter, who is one of the two girls left behind. Wait, what, how? It was like they had two ideas for two different movies but squished them into one. Flashbacks that don't make sense, sinister music but barely any action, eventually some stabbing and blood.

Emma Roberts is eight years older than Kiernan Shipka, who we can speculate is supposed to be 18 years old in the film... so somehow in a few years she's going to turn into Emma Roberts? This isn't like a little kid playing a character that gets picked up by an adult actress, this is two fully developed women portraying the same character a few years apart. It's stupid, it's lazy, and you should never watch another film by the people involved with this creative team.

The actual plot of the movie isn't that bad either so you're probably wondering why the low review? To put it simply the way the clips were pasted together made the story line lose something in my opinion, and it made the overall plot of the movie hard to fully grasp and interpret. It's already a slow burner so to combine that with a hard to follow plot makes it a garbage fire when it comes to enjoying the film."
" No. 1 Horror Suspense

That was before I accidentally came across this gem I never heard of, two years after it was made. I've watched more new horror since. Without a doubt 'The Blackcoats Daughter' aka 'February' is the Topper, oh boy is it the Topper, the ever lovin' lulu of horror suspense movies of all times. Scares me, frightens me, grips me like no other. More importantly, it made me think, what did I see? What was that all about? It takes a second viewing to understand the story or even comprehend the timeline of events and characters, but if you are a true film buff you'll be patient. Slow burn alrighty...a slow burn to hell."

" A strong directorial debut
",0.5106,0.9079,2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"A strong directorial debut From Perkins after a few acting appearances and screenplays. This is also only one of two features that Perkins has both written and directed. He is certainly one to watch in the future with an interesting if slightly disjointed style.February (aka The Blackcoat's Daughter) spins us a tale of Kat (Shipka from Mad Men) who is forced to spend a winter break at boarding school after her parents fail to pick her up and are unable to be contacted. In the short-term she is also with Rose (Boynton, American Horror Story) who's parents are also late but are on their way. The headmaster has entrusted their care with the two live-in nurses.The two girls could not be more opposite though, with Kat being shy, unassuming and slightly weird in her own way, while Rose is determined to make the most of the isolation and be with her boyfriend. Interspersed with all this we also follow the story of Joan (Emma Roberts) who appears to be trying to make her way towards the town the school is situated. She is offered a lift by Bill and his wife as they are heading in the same direction.Now Oz Perkins has definitely created a slow-burner here with this title. You do need patience as the film is very story-driven for the most part. There are long silences and the general colour of the film is watered down against the harsh back drop of a Canadian winter. The film is also very disjointed at times and certainly requires repeat viewing to get the most from it I feel.There is a huge twist which you may or may not see coming much earlier than the reveal, but the clues are there for those observant enough and paying attention. The problem though is that the clues appear far before they actually mean anything, which means you can easily forget them and then wonder what the hell is going on. This was most likely the directors intention. Many people did not like a certain aspect of the casting (will not spoil it for those who haven't seen this), but once you put all the pieces together I can see why he did this.Overall this a pretty good film, a little different (if nothing special) and is reasonably well acted throughout. Shilpa in particular does an impressive job at portraying her character. The sets and locations are all impressive and the photography is also very well done, as is the audio. Very bleak, dreary and washed out in colour, the film has a style of its own and builds the uneasy dread well. The ending is quite harrowing and it's refreshing to see a film close like this, as most directors tend to take the easy and happy way out now. Recommended.

The mood, atmosphere and tone are so eerily consistent that you really start to feel the isolation and mental undoing of the characters. Expertly acted by the whole cast (Don Draper's daughter in particular is brilliant), it's the kind of movie that gives you chills, because it's not overdone at all. There's a Hitchcockian vibe to it - a less is more, scariness in the shadows feel throughout.

" Not at all what I expected
",0.0,0.0887,2019-12-13 00:00:00,7,"I was not sure what to expect going in to this film. I knew almost nothing about it, as it is a relatively small and unknown film, and I had not seen anything about it until it showed up on Netflix one day. This movie is most definitely not for everyone. It has a lot of satanic elements that would make a lot of people uncomfortable, and it is an extremely slow burn that can make this hour and half film feel like three hours at times, and it doesn't really pick up until the last 20-25 minutes. Unlike many people on here, I found the film to be very captivating, as it immediately gives the viewer a feeling of dread, and that dread stays with you throughout the entire film. It does not take the route that many other horror films take, it does not throw constant jump scares and gore at you. The film takes its time to let a very disturbing story develop, and it does a great job at it. The acting by everyone in this film is very superb as well, and that really added a lot to the film. The acting is really what makes the movie as good as it is, because that is a big factor that contributes to the dread. There is also a bit of a plot twist/reveal that you figure out sort of half way, or two thirds of the way through the film that I really liked, and the use of time jumps makes the film work a lot better too. My only big problems with the movie is that it really does feel long at times, and could get a little boring, so I feel as if it could have been a little shorter, and I was not really a big fan of the ending, and I think that could have been done a little bit differently. Overall though, a pretty good film that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of horror movies."
" Wearing Fiberglass underwear would be more comfortable
",0.5563,0.9839,2019-12-03 00:00:00,2,"So let me see where to begin here? This was not great. It is slow AF. The sound effects and some of the audio elements were good and this was in color.
There are glints of acting present but note it does not quite make the mark.
The story had potential and at moments almost made it to the point of not being boring but overall it was mostly like a sound machine next to the bed to fall asleep to.
I actually had to re-watch to see what I missed while snoozing.
Great to chat on social media to and occasionally check in on then this is the one for you. If you want to be entertained then you may want to keep scanning for something else. The folks involved with making this seemed like they really wanted to be atmospheric and or suspenseful or even scary but somehow it ended up being more of a meh. Just really did not do any of the things that it seemed like it was going to do. I read reviews that were way more entertaining here than this could ever hope to be. The folks that scored it high see things in a different way for sure. The folks that scored it lower seemed more like myself in their views.
So the next time you have a scrape or a scratch or an itch that you can't scratch remember that's sort of like the way this will most likely leave you feeling. Just kinda rubbing around on the carpet asking out-loud, ""Why?"""

In some ways, the film echos Patient 9, which I would argue is one of the great chiller movies of all time. Throughout the film, I felt uncomfortable, not knowing who or what is in control. So again, I would give thumbs up to the dialogue, actors, settings and general filming.That said, why isn't it a 9 or 10? I do not think it was wise to split the movie in to the 3 view points. It interfered with the continuity of the story telling. I don't know what would work better. I just know there is a good, creepy story here. They did a great job using the film medium to tell most of that story. But in the end, not a good enough job to be a great film. I do recommend it. So a thumbs up. Just not way up."

A self cripplingly heavy handed approach to its main menace with some goofy attempts at the uncanny make this a movie that ultimately seems to just be a desperate scrambling for a plot to fit the tone they wanted.

The Blackcoat's Daughter is a serious dose of art house cinematic horror.The central performances, specifically Emma Roberts(Joan) and Kiernan Shipka (Kat), are utterly fabulous; authentic performances and horrific character development.

I think it started with ""Lovely Molly"" but these films with these weird stories that jump all over the place just seem randomly pop up from time to time. The Blackcoat's Daughter is hard to even discuss without spoiling the movie but it's not about ghosts or anything interesting like that it's about demonic possession and becoming attached to the demon once it's gone.The story is told in a way that the plot jumps around through the timeline. I have never seen a movie where that ever worked except for maybe Pulpfiction because that movie never made sense anyway. In A horror movie it's kind of important to have some sort of time flow so the viewer can understand what is happening and when. It's not exactly hard to piece together when the movie is jumping time and scenes but it just doesn't make the movie any smoother.It feels like this movie is missing scenes. Particularly when the girl got possessed and why she's so attached to the demon. Although it gives subtle clues as to why this movie really should have spelled it out better since the characters have absolutely no background given about them. This happens that happens and then this happens and then the movie is over.Overall it's a forgettable movie but the acting wasn't bad and that's what sold it to a 5/10 for me. I would have liked to have seen Kat's social problems explained more so you understand why she's such a social misfit and how she meets the demon but that would have made it a 6.5/10 movie."

" The tagline is a lie.
",0.0,-0.5182,2019-06-14 00:00:00,2,"And not only is the tagline a lie, it's trying to bring in exactly the wrong audience for this movie.The movie itself is beautifully shot, the music is very well done and varies between trance-chill and unsettling, and its choices to suddenly stop sounds abruptly are appropriate. It's nice to see less of the jump scare approach.But this movie is a mess. It prefers to just show us things that it doesn't really bother developing, so that we will respond to the imagery. That might work for some, but I'd prefer to have at least some basic idea of what's going on. The unease in this is achieved primarily through incoherency and an utter lack of any effort to convey anything to the audience.And more than that, it's annoying. No character is very interesting or has much depth to them. None of the main characters are remotely likeable or particularly sympathetic. The performances of a level half of the cast feel like they're acting in a completely different movie, and they don't understand the script either. It's a kind of awkwardness that seems to convey nothing quite so strongly as the entire cast didn't understand what they were supposed to be acting. The awkward scene probably was really awkward in real life, since no human beings ever communicate like anyone in this film.It's also, sad to say, boring. It doesn't keep its levels of tension consistent, it doesn't maintain the suspense, and it gives you absolutely no reason to want to believe in it. It's especially irritating to cut between characters and then seem to just be done with them, in favor of far less interesting ones. The writing just makes you feel like it wasted your time, which appropriately is exactly what it does.The problem is, this movie could have been decent. It had a decent cast, quite strong photography and imagery, an evocative soundtrack, and it seems to indicate that at least it had the seed of an idea, if not any particularly good ideas throughout. It has some unsettling, weird shots and some creepy imagery and implications, but overall it's not scary, it's not interesting, and it is not, least of all, coherent or comprehensible. It's just a collection of events.If you like any of the actors, you might be distracted for its runtime. If you like solid visual aesthetics, you should definitely give a look. But if you're looking for a scare or for a story, look elsewhere. As a movie, it's not good and really doesn't justify its pretensions."

" Too slow, too disjointed, too frustrating
",-0.6369,0.9724,2019-06-09 00:00:00,2,"I was encouraged to watch this based on its dark and different description. I watched it 55-60% of the way before giving up. It moved excruciatingly slowly, which was the first problem; I figure by halfway in I should have a general idea what the point of it all is, but I didn't. My curiosity was rekindled by the scene where Rose heard weird noises that her to the furnace room, but things went flat again soon after.Then there were the two storylines - Kat & Rose's and Joan's. They start off completely detached, which is frustrating because the movie jumps between them suddenly. When you get to the scene where Bill talks about Rose in the past tense, you begin to hone in on the fact that one side must be a flashback... but again, everything is being revealed so slowly it's hard to say.I also agree with the review by Internetghost, who said the characters are hollow. Namely Rose because she is practically emotionless when talking about being pregnant. And emotionless again despite being disturbed by Kat's behavior.Ultimately, I am glad to know they eventually got to the point, though I didn't hold on long enough to witness it. Slow burn movies can be fascinating and creepy in the best ways, such as one of Shyamalan's better creations, but they rely heavily on rich characters and tense moments to keep you engaged. This film had scant supplies of either for me."

When things finally, FINALLY, started happening it was good. It was different. Not your normal demonic possession movie. I liked the fact that it was set in the past and the present, just the cuts to the present felt kind of off to me. It was a fantastic concept, and actually really disturbing. The ending was great as well, Emma Roberts standing in the middle of a snow covered road screaming made me feel she'd realized the severity of what she'd done and that the demon wasn't coming back and she was alone.

" For Those Who Didn't Understand What Was Going On Events Explained ****Spoilers****
",0.0,-0.9993,2019-05-31 00:00:00,8,"If you watched the film to the end and have no idea what was happening, this ""review"" is for you. There are spoilers galore, so beware....First, the movie's timeline is not linear. It's in the present and the past and sometimes goes back to previous scenes to give you a different perspective from what you originally thought you were seeing. We see the story arc of girls left behind at an all girls Catholic school during holiday: Rose an older student (who stayed behind at the school because she thinks she's pregnant and lied to her parents about when to pick her up so she could see her boyfriend about her pregnancy), Kat, a freshman student who's parents haven't come to get her either and its not entirely clear why (later Kat says they are dead), and Joan, a girl on her way to the all girls school.Ostensibly, this movie is about the devil and possession. It is not. It is about longing, loneliness, and mental illness.Little Kat is lonely. At first you assume she's just a little strange, but when near the end of the film we see some scenes again (marking the days on a calendar until mom and dad come, singing at the recital, staring out of the window while sitting alone in a classroom) we come to see that she is a very lonely little girl and most likely not right in her head and we start to realize she may have been mentally ill all along.Everyone is saying that her transition to wanting and accepting possession by a demon was too sudden, but it's not (once you see those scenes again), she was already ""off"" and with the right suggestion (Rose tells her when they are alone that two of the nuns are devil worshipers), she goes right for it (later she tells Rose, she's ""too late"", i.e. her friendship is no longer needed, she has the devil for companionship now).Early on we see ""Joan's"" arc and through quick cuts we can surmise that Joan has escaped from a mental hospital. She's headed toward the school. At first you think the journey is being taken at the same time Kat and Rose are staying at the school But ""Joan"" in reality is Kat, nine years after she killed everyone left at the school. She's escaped and is using Joan's ID (apparently a nurse strangled at the mental institution), whom she's killed to escape.She's headed back to where she had companionship with the devil. Only to find out that the couple who give her a lift are the parents of Rose (whom she killed nine years ago) and are coincidentally headed up to the school. They apparently do not recognized sad goes outside to warm up the car because a storm is coming, Kat/Joan sees a a knife on a plate, which she later uses to kill Rose's parents while in their car, and brings their heads to her old companion, the devil.The devil never existed, of course. But this is a Catholic school, so her mental illness manifested into devil possession.Her phone calls may have been partly real or imagined. Early on Kat says her parents are dead. Are they? We have a brief scene at the beginning where it appears her dad comes to get her and silently walks her to a wrecked car where we see black hair (presumably mom's) blowing in the wind outside the window. When this did happen? The year before the events? Did her mom's death and apparent father's abandonment set off her mental illness and loneliness? That, I can't tell you. Maybe they both died in a car accident and she's dreaming her dad came to get her and show her the wreck. But then, why did the officials at the school believe her parents were coming for her? The existence of Kat's parents is not clear.The carnage starts when Kat gets a phone call and a distorted voice tells her to kill all the c***ts, which she does. The headmaster shows up with the police (did Kat lure them with a phone call?), finds the dead bodies of Rose and the two nuns who had been caring for them until their parents showed. The cop finds her in the basement and after warning Kat repeatedly to put down her knife shoots her in the shoulder (you see the scar on ""Joan"" later). Presumably she's spent the last years in the mental hospital making no friends or feeling love and is heading back to rejoin the devil, when Rose's parents pick her up and she gets a chance to sacrifice them. The devil being fickle (and only in her mind) doesn't show up."

Many things contribute to the atmosphere I mentioned, including a fantastic soundtrack and superb pacing.Regarding the latter, pay no attention to reviewers who are claiming that this movie is ""slow."" There is a distinct difference between intentionally deliberately paced and slow. A deliberate pace combined with savvy editing and eerie sound design is often what separates truly excellent horror film making from the kind of breakneck paced, unatmospheric junk we usually see. I would imagine that the people who are criticizing the pace of this movie probably don't appreciate classics of the genre like The Haunting (1963), The Changeling (1980), or The Innocents (1961). If those aren't your kind of movies then you probably won't like this one either.I'm still thinking about the last half an hour of this film. I think the writer / director made some miscalculations and moved the plot in a direction that ultimately brings the movie down a couple of notches. That's not to say it's conclusion is a complete failure. The last two shots are striking and much more in keeping with the first hour. Maybe I should give it an 8. In any case, for fans of carefully constructed and well-made horror films, this is a must-see. Maybe not quite an inevitable classic, but perhaps a near-miss."

They are both beautifully acted and have great set and sound design. Their stories are both enjoyable on the surface level, yet offer deeper layers if you want to go there. The difference is that The VVitch doesn't feel like an hour and a half long movie. It's definitely slow and doesn't give you much to work with, but it feels like they managed to tell a full story that is completely realized and satisfying. I'm amazed that they managed to fit so much in so little time. The VVitch feels like a long movie (in a good way). The Blackcoat's Daughter felt like it was a Cliff's Notes version that rushed through it's running time. My biggest issue is that they go from creepy to crazy way too fast and I never got to really enjoy and savor how unsettling and scary the location was. We shoot from zero to sixty and then just sit on cruise control for the rest of the film. I'm one of those people who feels exhausted just hearing that a movie is over two and a half hours, but I really feel like Blackcoat needs that extra hour to build the tension and flesh out their story. I refuse to spoil anything, so I'm going to be frustratingly vague and hope that if you choose to watch this film, you'll understand what I'm referring to. When Rose goes looking for Kat, the end of that scene is what I'm craving throughout the rest of the movie. I'm not asking for it to not be a ""slow burn"", but I feel like it's missing events. It leaves far too much on the table. It's a creepy boarding school, nearly abandoned in the dead of winter; I'd gladly spend another hour or so being spooked by barely audible whispers or creaks and shadows in the corner of the screen. I love what I got, but I still feel hungry for much more and not in a good way; I don't to order seconds, I just want my entire steak, not just a big chunk of it. Emma Roberts is a much smaller issue. With all of the great performances, an average one like Emma's sticks out. She's not bad, but she's not great with nuance; she doesn't turn it down when she needs to. The Blackcoat's Daughter is a more sophisticated horror movie than what we usually get, but even though I loved everything it gave me, I didn't get enough."
" Good performances undermined by plodding nihilistic screenplay
",0.1027,-0.9231,2019-05-21 00:00:00,4,"Roberts and Boynton give good performances. Shipka does well with what she has to work with, but since I think she was mostly instructed to ""look blank and creepy"" there's not a lot she could do with that.The story itself suffers from the soul-killing nihilism all too common in modern film -- emptiness and evil pervade everything.The story is very predictable once you figure out the non-linear timeline. With 20 minutes left in the film there was literally nothing new to present; the remaining screen time is the relentless grind to the obvious ending."

",0.0,0.9443,2019-05-05 00:00:00,7,"SO the movie opens and we learn about two girls living at an all girls prep school. One girl is a little spacey, out of it, not quite in touch with reality. The other girl has a lot more down to earth problems. They're stuck at the school for a few days waiting for their parents to come pick them up, under the watchful eye of a couple of school nurses. Then the hijinx begin.I don't want to give anything away in case you actually do want to watch the movie. If you like bleak, sparse, dreary atmosphere you might dig this. One thing this film has plenty of is atmosphere.The acting, the dialogue, almost everything else really, was as bare bones as you can get. It was so minimalist that it didn't generate any kind of emotional hook. I just didn't really care about the characters and the movie became more of an intellectual exercise in figuring out exactly what was happening.And that's the major problem for me. There was no satisfying explanation, not even enough of a hint of an explanation, as to why things were happening in the movie. If you don't care much about the characters then plot resolution is all you got, and there wasn't much of that either.I like movies where everything isn't spelled out for the audience but this one just didn't give me enough to work with. It's definitely interesting though, and if it seems like it might be your thing, if you're even a bit curious, give it a shot. The film makers were talented, but for me the film was just a little too spartan"

She's one of my favourite actors at the moment.The movie, I guess, goes for mood over anything else, but it really fails at that. The sense of mood isn't strong enough. It's more like the sense that it's TRYING for mood, which of course just makes you realise its failing.I couldn't really say what it's about. Something to do with a boarding school.The soundtrack, particularly, works overtime to convey the nihilistic, spooky mood, and the performances of the three main actresses also do this. But what about the story? Or the screenplay in general?I don't mind movies that leave you in the dark, but they have to give you something. ""The Blackcoat's Daughter"" is like listening to the soundtrack of a movie, while barely being able to make out the images."

The first 2/3 of the movie is kind of slow, but the cool setting and strong performances by the female leads anchor it and kept me engaged. The last 1/3 took a turn toward the macabre and disturbing. It kind of went full slasher flick. Because the first 2/3 was psychological thriller, I sort of expected something deeper for the end. Instead the last 1/3 was just dark and gory without being the fun kind of scary. Unsettling, and if that's what the director was going for then it was effective but it just wasn't for me."

For instance, with no apparent explanation of the motivation or reasoning of the spectre, an audience will be none the wiser, and tension is lost. It attempts an aesthetic stance but it ends up being not much more than a moping, tiring, trite, slasher. Much could have been salvaged by simply giving its audience a devilish spirit to excogitate.

It stars Emma Roberts, James Remar and rising star Kiernan ""The new Sabrina"" Shipka.It tells three girls tales and how they're interconnected. An incredibly slow burn it alas doesn't offer much in the way of a payoff that you'd certainly expect with this type of film. A payoff at all? Yes, an explanation? Yes, a good payoff and/or explanation? Absolutely not.Everyone looks bored which is kind of fitting because I'd imagine the viewer will be as well.

This little nasty had a deceptively tepid blu ray disc cover. The synopsis was also tepid. I was expecting a teen frightfest in the vein of Final Destination or Happy Death Day. This, however, was proper, like, film making wot! This was crafted, meticulously written, performed, and shot. It's slow but quietly purposeful.

I absolutely hated it, an absolute mess of a movie in all ways, the plot was wafer thin, the story telling was woeful at best, and considering the type of movie it was, I found it needlessly gratuitous. It was agonisingly slow, the only time I can imagine anyone waking up was to see the overly violent scenes, which I must add were very badly done.Emma Roberts was ok, but was clearly fighting a stinker of a script.

The movie started off as if something already took place and you had to just wait patiently until it truly unfolded. They introduced us to 3 young women in the movie and tried to tell us about them in a subtle way. I was ok with that but I wasn't ok with the movie dragging to make its point. I was beyond bored and frustrated. If you want to be even more aggravated just watch it till the very end. Do yourself a favor and not watch it.Long story short it's about girls that get possessed by the devil in a very boring way that you don't care anymore.

Don't watch this movie expecting jump scares,loud noises and stupid unrealistic decisions made by the characters. This is a slow burn, it starts slowly and it keeps building tension until the final act. From the beginning you get this unease, almost sickening feeling that something is just not right.

Now, having seen it a second time, I was indeed able to see the film for what it really is, which is beautifully chilling and a true modern day masterpiece. And - might I add - to my astonishment, I was actually able to purchase a digital copy of the film through Amazon, and while I paid a few more bucks than I'd have preferred, the second viewing was no doubt worth every last penny.It looks like a wide US release of the film isn't on tap until next year, but regardless of which year we choose to recognize as the film's official release year, it's no doubt one of the very best.

The story is fairly simple if you're looking at it on paper, but the way the scenes are pieced together make it a bit confusing.... which makes it interesting. There are many details that you can easily miss, without which the story could easily seem nonsensical. This may have been the reason it's received some unsatisfactory reviews. I think it moved at a great pace. The movement added a good amount of uneasiness. A perfect example of this is dialogue that is just the tiniest bit slower than normal, with some words delayed longer than others. Screwing with the normal cadence of speaking triggers a feeling like something just isn't right. Feeling odd, without a blatant reason, makes for a really fun experience. 
Absolute best part is the sound. Between ambient noise, effects and music.. it hit the mark.If you love psychological horror, it's worth the watch."

I quickly found myself guessing how each scene would end, and the ending was a head scratcher in all the wrong ways. It felt like the director wanted a movie about demonic possession but then saw Session 9 and thought, ""I've got to work that angle in"". It's pretty bad when a viewer can guess how a scene will play out and still not be able to understand what the director was going for. As for the ""monster"", it looked like Muzzy's(the learn another language monster, not the racial slur) goth cousin. I don't know why the director felt the need for a scene with a priest throwing holy water on the main character thus making the ""demon"" leave only to reveal that, surprise the demon never left and she's out to finish what she started.

Loneliness and fear can posses us, just like demons. They can drive us crazy.
This horror movie is a slow-burner and definitely not for everyone. The idea behind it is very good and well played upon... I'm just not really sure that it needs the gory parts to be this explicit. It felt a lot like gratuitous gore. Or maybe it just seemed much too real and grotesque... more like real-life murders, than a movie.

Scratching it in puzzlement rather than irritation I hasten to add.The tension is allowed to build, with a barren score to emphasise rather than create a mood. From the start we see Kat speaking staccato - like she's an alien in a human shell, barely aware of how to conduct a conversation. I know teenagers are meant to be weird but this is pushing it. I try not to predict the ending when watching films, preferring to allow the director's vision to just wash over me so my reaction will be one of acceptance and understanding.
It's a darned good job I didn't try to change my approach on this one - I honestly had no idea where this was going or quite why. Clearly this will reveal me as dim witted by those who could ""see the twist coming from miles off""... but if that's how you get your kicks, by being right, whereas I get mine from being surprised by a director, I know which I'd prefer. There are clues there if you want to poke around and tie them together, but it was the clanking of clues that didn't quite sit right that left me trying to figure out who did what to whom and why.That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, I very much did, but I'm going to have to read Wikipedia and a few reviews from others on here as I'm still a little bemused.On a side note, this is the 22nd film I've tagged with 'decapitation'"

Strangely, A24 wanted the name changed from February to The Blackcoat's Daughter which actually turned me away from the film. Anyhow, this film terrified me and I couldn't have been more clueless. Some say The Blackcoat's Daughter is a slow burn but it isn't. The horror is there from the very beginning. Sit with this movie and quietly watch. It isn't cerebral, pretentious or artsy, it's just a darn good scary story. Watched it several times and STILL find something new every single time I watch it."

Why use two actresses to play the same person when they almost appear to be the same age anyway (9 years difference supposedly)?All in all a big disappointment. 3 stars for the effort to be different.
" Engaging and creepy but had potential to be something phenomenal
",0.1779,-0.8214,2018-02-16 00:00:00,5,"The Black Coat's daughter or February as it's titled on UK Netflix, exceeded my expectations and had a lingering after affect. In my opinion, any movie (particularly a horror) that is capable of leaving the viewer feeling moved, disturbed or reflective is one that has done it's job to an extent.Although the build-up is slow, it's engaging from the beginning and has you wondering what's unfolding and searching for explanations for what's happening and why. There are subtleties present throughout that thread into the plot that make this more clever than a lot of the standard horrors that rely on cheap jump-scares, gore or shock factor. A vacant all girls boarding school is the perfect setting and creates the entire creepy atmosphere that is present throughout. There's a real sense that the two girls are completely isolated and the vastness of the building combined with it's creaky doors and floors and dingy decor creates a very realistic sense of dread that we've all experienced at some point in our lives. The acting was strong, but Kiernan Shipka stole the spotlight. She's such an incredibly talented actress, who although young, is very multi-faceted and complex in her portrayal of the characters she plays. Her character, Katherine (Kat), was sweet and innocent but also incredibly mysterious and sinister, which Kiernan managed to portray wonderfully. Although this was the first performance I'd seen of Lucy Boynton, she was also a strong leading role and it was very easy to step into her shoes and live the story through her.Now for the areas that could've been improved and the reason why the rating I've given is 5 stars instead of 10. The first issue with this movie is the casting of Emma Roberts as Joan a.k.a adult Kat. Following on from Kiernan, Emma just didn't seem the right fit for Katherine since the aura and personality she brought to the character felt so different. Stemming from this issue is the slightly fragmented characterisation of the main characters, but mainly Katherine. Although Kiernan brought her A-game and gave everything she could to the role, she could've gone even further if she'd been given better material to work with. Katherine's progression from a sweet, innocent child to devil worshipper happened much too suddenly and with very little explanation or clarity. By delving even further into the psyche of Katherine's character I think the story would've been greatly improved and been much more impactful. Secondly, the addition of a paranormal force a.k.a The Devil felt unnecessary and cheapened the plot. For starters The Devil was an ambiguous black shadow that looked like someone dressed in a floppy-eared bunny costume, which for obvious reasons detracted from the fear factor. But also, the connection between the Devil and Kat was unclear and I found myself actually having to do a Google search after the movie ended to clarify the ending. Thirdly, the addition of Joan into the story is executed poorly and it becomes obvious early on who she is, even if her plans are unclear for a while. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that removing Joan (Emma Roberts) entirely and expanding on Kat and Rose's arc would've improved the movie vastly. Precious time was wasted building up the mystery around Joan and the kind couple that had taken her in, when that time could've been used more wisely to further build the tension and apprehension at the school and dig deeper into Kat's transition to the dark side. The strange connection between Kat and the Devil and her motivators for her actions are definitely the weakest points of this movie. As a viewer I think it's important to fully understand the motivators for the main character's actions and this movie completely fails to deliver on this. Why does Kat turn to the Devil in the first place? Why is she so willing to murder Rose just because some distorted voice at the end of the phone tells her to? Why is she so desperate for the Devil to return to her that she kills Rose's parents, who are actually really nice people? There's little to no logic in why Kat does what she does and that just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.Overall, this movie is worth watching as it definitely has something to offer, but a few tweaks here and there could've transformed it into a true masterpiece."

" A creepy and disturbing tale with all the elements of a good horror movie
",-0.6249,-0.9979,2018-01-31 00:00:00,9,"A young girl's isolation at a Catholic boarding school in Upstate New York leads to increasingly disturbing behavior, while a psych-ward escapee drifts closer, in the nail-biting supernatural thriller, The Blackcoat's Daughter (2015). Originally titled February, writer/director Oz Perkins intended this film to be a meditation on loneliness. He crafted a creepy and disturbing tale that has all the elements of a good horror movie.The film is essentially divided into two stories that progressively come together in a surprise ending. In the first, a freshman girl named Kat (Kiernan Shipka) is staying at her Catholic boarding school over winter break because her parents have failed to pick her up. Rose (Lucy Boynton), a senior, told her parents the wrong date to buy time so she could find out whether she was pregnant. They are watched by two nuns. Rose receives several phone calls from a mysterious voice she calls ""Dad,"" and her behavior becomes more disturbing with each phone call.In the second story, a man named Bill (James Remar) picks up a young hitchhiker named Joan (Emma Roberts) over the objections of his wife, Linda (Lauren Holly). It's implied Joan escaped from a hospital, but Bill believes she reminds him of his daughter, Rose, who was brutally murdered several years earlier. Bill and Linda are traveling to their daughter's former school to lay flowers. Bill tries to emotionally connect with Joan, believing God brought them together. Joan replies that she doesn't believe in God.**Spoilers** At the school, Kat brutally murders Rose and the nuns, decapitates them, and offers them up to Satan in a macabre ritual in the boiler room. A police officer confronts her and fires a shot. Later, in the hospital, a priest exorcises the demon from Kat, and she sees a shadowy figure disappear. In the present, Joan (now revealed to be a grown-up Kat) kills both Bill and Holly, steals their car, and completes her journey back to the boiler room, only to find it unlit and silent.Like No Country for Old Men (2007), The Blackcoat's Daughter uses stark realism and little dialogue to set the tone. Not much is spoken during the 93 minute run time, and even in the climax, Kat remains eerily silent. As the police office points a gun at her and repeatedly yells to drop the knife, she quietly replies, ""Hail Satan."" Unlike No Country for Old Men, music plays a prominent role in The Blackcoat's Daughter. The score itself scratches at your reptilian brain like something from the underworld.Kiernan Shipka, mostly known for playing Don Draper's daughter, Sally, in Mad Men (2007-2015), adds a subtle charm to her role. Her character in The Blackcoat's Daughter doesn't display much emotion, and has few lines, so poise and control is where her talent shines through, especially when called upon to flash a mischievous smile. Unfortunately, she hasn't appeared in much else recently, although she's set to play the titular role in a reboot of Sabrina the Teenage Witch.The Blackcoat's Daughter suffers from the 'Christianity is Catholic' trope. At least since The Exorcist (1973), horror films have associated the Catholic Church with mystery, superstition, and demonology. Even though many Protestant denominations believe in Satan and demonic possession, if the Devil appears in a movie, you know the Catholic Church will be involved. It's not terribly distracting in this film because the director uses it so subtly, but it's my one complaint.As a horror film, The Blackcoat's Daughter does everything right. A good horror movie goes beyond simplistic scares, and The Blackcoat's Daughter uses a typical horror theme to explore the larger themes of loneliness and emotional isolation. It concludes like a dark symphony. At the end, you feel the loss Kat has for her deceased parents, the life she could have had, and the horrible crimes she committed. Now she has to deal with the consequences of her actions alone, and she finally breaks down and cries."

Temos mais um excelente terror indie, subjugado pelos grandes marketings hollywoodianos, que vem para somar ao também ótimo The Witch. Uma mesma atmosfera, construção de cenário, fotografia e trilha sonora, mostrando que não só de jumpscares é feito o terror e o horror, mas de muita construção de clima.O filme conta a história de 3 jovens: Kat, Rose, e Joan. Kat, a mais nova, passa por um problema similar ao de Rose: ambas são 'esquecidas' durante o feriado de inverno em seus internatos religiosos, tendo que ficar aos cuidados das irmãs do local. Joan, por sua vez, é uma jovem com um misterioso passado que quer, de qualquer forma, retornar a Port Smith (local onde se localiza a mesma escola de Kat e Rose). Durante esse início já temos a apresentação de dois ambientes, o de Joan, e o internato de Kat e Rose, e onde deve-se passar grande parte do longa, visto que Joan também tem interesse de ir ao local.
Apesar de não serem conhecidas, o vínculo entre Kat e Rose cresce gradativamente, principalmente por serem as únicas a estarem no local (além das irmãs), porém pesadelos constantes de Kat e presenças obscuras sentidas e presenciadas por Rose fazem com que as meninas se vejam em situações completamente insanas. Enquanto isso acontece, Joan consegue carona com um casal que também está indo a Port Smith, e o marido a acolhe principalmente por sua grande semelhança com sua filha falecida. Mas, em algum momento, o passado de Joan também cobra sua dívida e, de alguma forma, as três jovens experimentarão acontecimentos perturbadores e nada convencionais, principalmente se tratando de um local religioso.Uma confusão inicial, que consegue atar nós bem interessantes ao longo da história, e finalizando com um clima ainda mais controverso. As três personagens, apesar de serem apáticas, de aparência triste e construção mínima, tem um clima extremamente sombrio e desconfiado. Na verdade, todo o filme tem o mesmo ar: sombrio, escuro, triste, frio, e altamente denso. Talvez ""denso"",""pesado"" e ""minimalista"" sejam justamente as qualidades dessa nova safra de terror, que constrói toda uma história baseada somente em excelentes fotografias, ambientes minimamente construídos, e uma trilha sonora bem peculiar, que com certeza nos remete aos excelentes John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Polanski, Hitchcock etc. É bastante interessante, inclusive, observar que as maiores produções da atualidade não são nada mais, nada menos, que uma repaginada da grandiosa leva dos anos 60, 70, com uma construção claustrofóbica, noir, e altamente bem trabalhada no suspense e não, somente, nos sustos e efeitos desmedidos.
É sim, preciso tomar bastante cuidado com o momento que se pretende assisti-lo. É um filme bastante lento, arrastado, com pouquíssimas falas e pegando pesado nas interpretações apáticas (é bem interessante observar que, ao invés do excesso, há uma visível preocupação de todos em não demonstrar sentimentos, justamente para ajudar na criação da ambientação tão necessária).
Além do já comentado, o longa é repleto de imagens perturbadoras, cenas propositais que conseguem provocar sensações nada agradáveis no momento certo. O já falado jogo de sombras, aliado a uma trilha sonora crescente conseguem transportar o telespectador ao exato espaço apresentado, causando, minimamente, caras de nojo. 
Mas, não somente de jogos de sombras e ritmo lento vive The Blackcoat's Daughter (antes chamado de February, possivelmente por fazer referência ao período de férias em que as meninas ficam presas no internato), como, também, de um gore necessário, implícito, e que consegue incomodar. Principalmente na última meia hora, quando temos um aumento no ritmo, observamos uma grande onda de sangue e mortes, aliadas a cenas perturbadoras também trabalhadas na trilha sonora e no jogo de sombras. 
O final, por sua vez, lembra bastante (em ideia) o final de The Witch, quando SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER observamos que a aceitação de um ser das trevas não se faz, somente, por obrigação; mas, também, por uma insatisfação total com o que a nossa vivência cristã nos apresenta SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER. Sendo assim, nos coloca em xeque com tudo aquilo que outros do gênero nos apresenta, a eterna batalha entre o bem e o mal, o mundo maniqueísta etc.História: apesar de não ser nada inovador, e, julgando até como sendo muito rasa, consegue, nos seus limites, ambientar bem uma história que, sob alguns aspectos, lembra bastante um conto.
Atores/personagens: todos, sem exceção, são excelentes em sua exposição de desinteresse, algo crucial à produção. Não há empatia por ninguém, o que é justamente o preciso para que se tenha tal produção. 
Suspense: bastante. Carro chefe do longa.
Trash: sim, mas nada visual. Há elementos do trash, sem necessariamente ser ""trash"", se é possível entender rs.
Gore: sim, principalmente nas cenas finais. 
Final: excelente, mostrando que nem tudo são mares de flores. E, soltando um spoiler agradável, e que em nada atrapalha a dinâmica do longa: àqueles que se sentiram órfãos de um ""black phillip"", observem bem a cena final, do hospital, em que temos uma presença ilustre (quem em muito me lembrou, em formato, à Donnie Darko, também).Super recomendo! Hoje, rápido, o quanto antes. Mais um excelente exemplo de como essa nova leva consegue produzir filmes maravilhosos, sem abusar dos clichês e enaltecendo os grandes e antigos mestres do cinema do horror."
" Slow, atmospheric, simple
",0.0,0.9899,2018-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Blackcoats daughter takes a familiar story about possession but elevates it with an amazing atmosphere, pacing (I will get to that later), eerie soundtrack and great performance by the actors!The soundtrack reminds me very much of the artist ""The Haxan Cloak"" who probably draws inspiration from movies just like this one. It uses a lot of ""shrubbing"" violins, deep, creeky, dark tones, never to loud or too silent and (needless to say no startling noises, which are simply the jump-scares of audio). The movie uses the soundtrack very efficiently, only in the beginning I thought once or twice, that it wasnt necessary or that it was unfitting for the scene.Im pretty sure many people will have a problem with the pacing, but it snaps in perfectly! For example, reaches the typical horror half-hour marks almost exactly on the minute. The way its shot may seem slow though. A characteristic I love! I enjoy horror with dark atmosphere instead of Gore or scares. Something that drew me into the story quickly, was the story-telling tecnique, its not straight-forward so that you can almost see the entire movie in your head, before actually finishing it, which keeps your interest up. But it also isnt told in a convoluted or abstract way, so at the end you wont have to scratch your head, although only if you payed attention.I could tell you a dozen more things I like about this movie, the only point where it lost me, was the story. Its not terrible, but with such a good build-up, I really hoped for a bigger purpose behind everything or simply a plot-twist. The movie has a definititive climax, yes but some tiny brick was missing to complete the walls of this eerie Prison"
" Not For The Impatient - A Creepy Slow-Burn Tale Of Evil
",-0.5442,0.9672,2018-01-17 00:00:00,9,"The only reason someone would rate this fantastic film so low is because they have an incredibly low attention-span. Set in a bleak winter at an all-girls Catholic boarding school where two girls parents don't show up on time to pick the up for winter break, leaving the girls stranded at the school. What ensues is an immensely dark and moody story supplemented with another second story that intertwines with the main story perfectly, with a gut punching ending when the two stories reveal their similarities. Again, the film uses a slow increase in tension throughout most of the film, leading to one heck of an ending.While the films pacing is slow, it is incredibly creepy, well put-together, and increasingly tense. It uses a long build up to brutal ending and does so beautifully, the films ending was well worth the wait in my opinion, and the tense and long build up only made the ending more effective. Everything from the sound design, cinematography, color scheme, and direction are all superb and create and amazingly creepy story of innocence being defiled by evil itself, a wonderful second film for newbie director Oz Perkins, who's first film was an average at best horror film that was a Netflix exclusive.Over all a superb film that is only for the patient viewer."
" if you liked the witch. you will love this
",0.6705,-0.8265,2018-01-03 00:00:00,8,"I'm a sucker for atmospheric horrors, that's why the witch is one of my favourite horror movies. the blackcoats daughter is one of them now.it's a simple story, which i believe is a good thing for movies like this because convoluting the plot with too much context ruins the feeling, which movies like this are supposed to be about. there are paranormal aspects sure but the movie isn't about that, it's about the effect of those things on the people. it's about loneliness and how feeling alone can be as much, if not more, scary than having a demonic presence. and focusing on that rather than making things appear spooky makes the subject of (i.e people in) the story more relatable. it increases the tension which I believe modern horror films are lacking in abundance.there are no jump scares which have plagued horror movies as of late and that is the main reason I liked this movie so much. the acting was really good and you could tell the actors really understood what the movie was about. as a final note I just want to say that this movie is best watched alone because having company might distract from the atmosphere building which requires complete focus and is absolutely necessary to enjoy this tale of a cold February weekend"
" The Blackcoats Daughter
",0.0,-0.8662,2017-12-21 00:00:00,8,"The Blackcoats Daughter is a long awaited film that originally went by the name of ""February"" until its release. It's particularly odd how the film didn't make more noise with a wider release since it has all the ingredients to be a successful movie. It has young hip female actresses in Emma Roberts, Kiernan Shipka and Lucy Boyton who all played their roles really well and also demonic movies are still very popular among the masses. What the film brought to my attention is the chilling feeling of isolation in a cold climate. The setting of dead winter in rural Connecticut is an icy enough feeling but the dreadful mood by the actors and the dark lighting and atmosphere really portrayed the cold hopeless tone. It's a shame The Blackcoats Daughter went so far under the radar because it turned out to be a very solid flick that has the potential for reviewing."

The film is really, really slow and nothing happens. When things do happen it's boring and you're not surprised at all or feel frightened. The music and the way the film was edited played a huge part in it, plus the meh script. You could smell who the killer was a mile away, but it still took them far too long to reveal that the two narratives were set in different times - the future and the past. The actors weren't that qualified either, everything felt forced and unnatural."

" Impressively creepy psychological horror movie
",-0.1779,-0.3542,2017-12-04 00:00:00,8,"In this brooding psychological horror film, two female students become stranded at their prep school over the winter, one abandoned by her parents, the other by deceiving hers. A second story thread told simultaneously, has another girl, a hospital escapee, head towards the school, accepting a lift from a middle aged couple who are grieving the anniversary of their daughter's death.Set in the middle of winter, this one has a chilly atmosphere from the get-go and I found it to be a very good example of a modern horror movie. It is not afraid to hold things back from the viewer and instead reveal its details as it goes on; this sense of mystery accentuates the suspense and feeling of dread that permeates events. The two plot strands do eventually dovetail together and the puzzle is finally revealed. Although I think it would be fair to say that there is an element of audience manipulation here once you understand the twist, given the different actresses used but I am willing to forgive this as the movie earned a certain amount of slack on account of delivering such an effectively creepy and unpredictable narrative. Audience cheating aside, this is a film which feels like it demands a re-watch to me. Its enigmatic qualities and off-kilter ambiance ensured that it had a very good atmosphere throughout, helped considerably by the impressive low ominous soundtrack used throughout. The acting is very good too, with Kiernan Shipka especially impressive as the girl who begins the piece very timid and then becomes very scary later on. The horror is a mixture of visceral moments with atmosphere-driven oddness, such as strange conversations in the dead of night, a shadowy demon and uncanny rituals in a furnace room. It all adds up to a very impressive feature which offers us some genuine intrigue, well delivered sinister scenes and a fragmented story we are allowed to piece together ourselves. This is definitely something of an under-rated gem I would say."
" Almost nothing fits together
",0.0,0.9963,2017-11-25 00:00:00,4,"""The Blackcoat's Daughter"" (US title, the better one in my opinion) or ""February"" (UK title) is a Canadian 90-minute movie from 2015, in the English language of course, so still a relatively new movie that soon gets a DVD release here in Germany I think. The director and writer is Oz Perkins, son of Anthony Perkins, and this is his first directorial effort as he was a prolific actor until now mostly. With Remar, Holly, Roberts and Shipka, he got a pretty decent cast together, the 3 ladies are for example very famous for their small screen acting (Mad Men, NCIS, American Horror Story). But back to this one here. The film includes two core story lines who seem to have basically no connection almost and also seem to take place during very different times, there is a huge gap between these, so it is not a chronological story at all. The one thing I want to say here is that I am a huge Kiernan Shipka fan and everybody who has seen her on Mad Men will have a hard time making a case against her being the most talented actress under 20 right now that Moretz and Steinfeld have passed that mark. And she also did not let me down here. Luckily, the longer the film goes the more she moves into the center of it all and definitely elevates the material on several occasions. There is one phone scene in particular where she really shines with her face expressions. I think she really combines dedication and vulnerability so well that I am positive we will see a lot of greatness from her in the coming years, probably decades.The rest of the cast was okay too. The acting really wasn't the problem here and I even liked Emma Roberts and I am usually not too big on her. The problem is the execution though. It is all quantity over quality. Almost every scene is supposed to be scary and creepy and it quickly becomes annoying. There is zero build-up and as a consequence also almost zero good moments. The few jump scares did not really add anything either. I am sure Perkins sees a lot more in this film than audiences do. But he just did not get his vision through, mostly with his writing, but also with the direction. In my viewing, I even heard people laughing at how bad it was at times and that's the only explanation as there are 0% comedy in here unless you c(o)unt the unexpected and random inclusions of the c-word. The exorcism scene near the end is the best example. It is a really crucial moment, but it feels rushed in for the sake of it as Perkins is puzzling together snippets that have worked in horror films over the last years, decades even, but it's never more than snippets. They are not really fitting together. The music, score, soundtrack (call it whatever you like) is not helping either as it added a great deal of negativity to the showy over-the-top way in which basically every scene should be memorable, but the opposite was achieved, namely that the memorable moments became forgettable. Not even the atmospheric take was successful with the (almost) empty school. Or the reference about the burned hair of the two women, which was there, but never picked up on again. It was truly shoddy to watch at times. There was such a good opportunity for a quality film here given the cast, but they definitely missed out on it and the outcome is a great example of how script is key and even strong actors cannot make a weak story work. I give these 1.5 hours a thumbs-down and suggest you watch something else instead."
" Superb satanic movie for thinkers
",0.6249,0.9815,2017-11-23 00:00:00,9,"This is a movie you will have to watch twice for sure to truly understand it but that's OK because you will want to watch it again anyway. I watched it twice back to back and was even more riveted the second go around. This is a superb satanic movie with all of the necessary ingredients to make it one. The acting is very good across the board but especially true for the actors playing the characters of Kat, Rose and Joan. The soundtrack (score) was equally superb and added tremendously to the film. Some seem to think it was distracting but I thought it very enhancing from start to finish. I very nearly gave this movie a 10 and frankly I'm not sure what made me shave off a star/point. It's a movie you have to pay attention to because it jumps around quite a bit and utilizes flashbacks. All in all I think the film was quite masterfully done. If you have a short attention span or are someone that likes fast paced action and a film that starts at ""A"" and ends at ""Z"" without any sort of zig zagging around...you probably should skip this one. If you don't enjoy a movie that requires some thinking and puzzle solving then again, this is one you should probably skip. I wanted to write a review without any spoilers but that's sort of difficult because it's the ending that's still got me puzzled. I'm going to watch the movie again in a week or two and see if I still believe what I think is happening to Kat/Joan in the last scene is really what I think is going on. I think she missed the demon and wanted it back desperately. Her trip back to the school was going to happen no matter what but getting picked up by Rose's parents was something Joan/Kat didn't expect or plan. Maybe that laugh in the bathroom stall after she realized Bill & his wife were Rose's parents was because she thought her encountering them was a special gift from the demon? I think she murdered them and took their heads off as an offering...a gift to the demon. Upon arriving at the school with their severed heads and going to the furnace room once again where she had been shot by the police officer, she hoped to be reunited with the demon who she had asked not to go when the priest was performing the exorcism. The demon was no longer there and no longer possessing her, it was gone...the priest's exorcism worked and the demon was gone forever. I believe her reaction in that last scene was the realization that the demon was in fact gone for good and that realization was devastating for Joan/Kat. Great movie...watch it!"
" The Blackcoat's Daughter is a supremely suspenseful gem
",0.5719,-0.9677,2017-11-14 00:00:00,10,"Are our collective fears changing? Evolving? In the 90s, Scream—with its self-awareness and meta-humor—gave a much-needed rebirth to the slasher genre, and a craze of twisty teen films with high body counts followed. In the 2000s, Saw bet all its chips on hyper- violence, and the term ""torture porn"" was thrust upon our culture. Now, we are witnessing perhaps the most substantial change to the horror formula to date and the rise of a new sub-genre. These modern films focus far less on gratuitous violence and concern themselves more with a journey that leads us to tragic ends. This new crop of horror is more cerebral, less conventional—films which have been called ""art house horror""—even ""post-horror.""At the forefront of this movement is award-winning production studio A24, which released such films as The Witch and It Comes at Night. Unfortunately overlooked in this pack is The Blackcoat's Daughter, written and directed by Osgood Perkins (son of Psycho's Anthony Perkins). Fantastically executed in almost every regard, The Blackcoat's Daughter is a supremely suspenseful gem.Despite being Perkins's directorial debut, the mood setting, storytelling, and performances he compels from his cast are masterful. Set primarily over winter break at a girls' boarding school, Perkins and cinematographer Julie Kirkwood paint a gorgeous, abandoned world of ice and snow and shadows. Each scene is beautifully framed, most are dimly and fluorescently lit. Darkness looms over every brick. The atmosphere of the film is unsettling from its very first frame.Further enhancing that tone is the film's score by Elvis Perkins (Osgood's brother). The reliance on strings and discordant, frantic melodies breathes terror. It's a unique and unsettling score—one of the best of the modern horror era.What hooked me, however, was the expert storytelling; the film excels at building and unraveling mystery. The rise in action is admittedly slow—not to be confused with boring. Menace lurks behind every corner, and often in plain sight. The film's tension and uncertainty are addictive drugs. There's a compelling drip of detail following two young, worried women stuck in an otherwise empty dormitory and a third who hitches a ride with a kind stranger. The film's unfurling of its mysteries and merging of its story arcs is beautiful and not without significant and satisfying surprises. Perkins's skills as a storyteller keeps us in our seats, fully captivated, and needing to see how this all plays out. And The Blackcoat's Daughter's third act does not disappoint. Its conclusion is intense, brutal—the kind of payout horror fans should expect.The acting, across the board, is fantastic. Scream queen Emma Roberts, Dexter's James Remar, and relative newcomer Lucy Boynton each deliver convincing performances as their troubled, broken characters. But for all the great acting found in the picture, the real highlight is Mad Men's Kiernan Shipka in the lead. Her nuanced yet intense performance as shy Kat is something to behold: off- center, menacing. Perhaps no one else could make the line, ""You smell pretty,"" give one such intense shudders. Shipka's efforts here should be considered among the all- time great performances of the genre.Like A24's more commercially successful The Witch, The Blackcoat's Daughter is artistic horror of the highest quality: a haunting film that is equal parts beautiful and brutal. The mesmerizing film builds and builds towards a satisfying and sinister conclusion that will likely lead to more than one sleepless night."

I consider myself a horror aficionado, loving every sub-genre and delving into the unknown, low-budget, foreign, and extreme horror movies. I'm the biggest fan of the foreign extreme sub-genre. The reason I point this out is because since I was a little kid, I've been addicted to horror movies. That first really really scary movie you see (which for me was Quarantine in my very early teen years) gives you that intense feeling of pure fear coupled with an insane 90 minute adrenaline rush. That was almost like a high for me, I loved the feeling of being scared. And I've spent my life watching every horror movie I could, good and bad, searching for that feeling that first good horror movie gave me. Sad to say it is extremely rare I ever feel scared during a horror movie, and have found that even the most disturbing movies don't make me cringe or look away.Then I watched The Blackcoat's Daughter. A movie I had never heard of and knew nothing about, I was just bored and threw it on the TV. The Blackcoat's Daughter is a slowburn masterpiece of filmmaking that left me on the edge of my seat for all 93 minutes. It shocked me, and creeped me the f*ck out every second of the way. From the get-go it is off-kilt all the way through. Every scene from the second it starts seems eerily off. A spine- tingling, sinister feel.Not only is this movie completely terrifying, but it is so masterfully made it blew me away. Every shot is so beautiful in such a creepy way. The lighting and camera angles are magnificent. The script fantastic with insanely good performances all around. All this put together creates one of the best atmospheres in a horror movie I've ever seen. It sucks you right in from moment one and doesn't let you go till after the credits roll. I literally mean after because once I was done I was staring at the credits, jaw-dropped, unsure what to do next or what I had just seen. After watching this I was quite literally in shock and awe. I immediately restarted it and watched it again, the second viewing even better than the first. So many things are so expertly and subtly placed throughout that you could never catch in a first viewing. Coming from a longtime horror fanatic: watch this. Immediately. As soon as possible. It seems to be a hit or miss for people but if it hits let me tell you this movie stuck with me for weeks. I know I'm making this out to be the best horror movie ever made, so I'll clear that up. The Blackcoat's Daughter actually is one of the best slowburn atmospheric chillers to ever see the screen."
" Disappointed.
",-0.4767,-0.7626,2017-10-31 00:00:00,3,"The Blackcoat's Daughter has Good acting, nice creepy music and visual effects but, it's extremely boring!!! After half hour i was tempted to quit thanks to endless scenes like the one where Rose talks to her boyfriend in his car. The only thing that kept me from stopping is my curiosity, although i regret it...I had to watch one of the worst costumes and endings in the movie history, for costumes i mean the guy with long hair and bunny ears that supposed to be Satan or some demon."
" This atmospheric and interesting chiller is not for everyone
",0.4019,-0.9894,2017-10-28 00:00:00,6,"Also known as 'February'.This slow burn psychological horror film does not reveal itself right away. It splinters its narrative between a pair of young women left behind at their catholic boarding school during a winter break and a potentially unstable woman who has been picked up by good samaritans while drifting through a nearby town. How these plot fragments fit together is left as a mystery for quite some time, compelling the audience to follow this cryptic road map that has no clear direction at the journey's inception. It is part of what makes the experience so unnerving in a way. You know something awful is lurking at the end destination, you're just not sure what.As a result of this ambiguity, 'The Blackcoat's Daughter' will not be for everyone. For the majority of the runtime, there is nothing overtly happening beyond some eerie atmospherics and strange incidents and conversations that point to a larger game at play, while writer/director Oz Perkins makes effective use of sound design and an ominous synth score to underwrite the unsettling mood of the piece. This is his directorial debut and he shows an unfettered confidence in spinning and weaving together the threads of his spider's web, which you'll still be untangling once it's all over. It is an impressive and assured calling card from a first-time filmmaker whom we can expect more interesting projects from in the future, though I don't imagine his output will draw in large audiences.The cast is pretty solid, with Emma Roberts playing aloof and brittle throughout, while Lucy Boynton and Kiernan Shipka generate some efficacious tension during the school scenes, but it is perhaps the quiet intensity of James Remar that keeps the experience spicy. Whenever he is on screen you are never entirely sure if he is a creepy threat or merely a somber but sincere man. It's one of the best performances he has given in a long time and adds to the overall mystery of the plot. However, since none of the character motivations are ever made completely clear, it makes it difficult to invest in anyone because there is a nagging suspicion that the rug is going to be pulled out from beneath us with any one of them at any given time. Without a clear protagonist with a clear goal or arc, we are left to observe events rather than participate in them.Then there is the question of substance. What does this whole story add up to once we reach the end? Perkins seems more concerned with trading in shock value and brutal violence with his third act than he is with revelation. If you're going to tell a psychological horror story then you need to be exploring something deeper than surface textures and terrors. You need to embrace metaphor and subtext, and ultimately impart a deeper meaning, whether that be about grief or religion or sexuality or fear, or whatever the case may be. I am not quite sure we get that substance here, but sometimes the most disturbing and effective horror films know how to generate an atmosphere of foreboding and evoke a palpable sense of dread, and 'The Blackcoat's Daughter' succeeds in that respect.For those who like their horror more immediate and visceral, this film will be a tough and frustrating slog until the last 20 minutes, but for those who prefer chills over thrills, this might be a spider web worth getting caught in and untangling."
" Atmosphere or hot air?
",0.0,0.5419,2017-10-12 00:00:00,4,"I see that some of the reviews say the film has great atmosphere. I guess that's what you call taking very long pauses before delivering lines and taking long camera strolls down steps and hallways. If an ominous soundtrack is added behind that, you're given the feeling that something scary is happening when really, most of the time, nothing is happening. The acting was quite good with lead character, Shipka, doing a smashing job of playing someone who isn't quite all there. The ending leaves one scratching the head. Is it a response to loneliness or regret or awareness? Unsatisfying. While better than your average slasher flick, it is not the ""horror masterpiece"" that was promised on the cover of the DVD case."
" You Fill In The Blanks With Your Own Fears
",-0.4215,0.5168,2017-10-07 00:00:00,7,"This is a very creepy film. How wonderful the Director uses what's not said instead of what's said. The use of sound as others have noted: masterful. All that said I'm not sure what I just saw. While others say it implores a second viewing, I think otherwise. Our writer and director want us to think about this for a while. Like Momento, a movie talked about and puzzled over days after. Perhaps there is no definitive story line, and they want us to fill in our own gaps. Take an egg, crack it, and let the viewer decide what we have here: fried or scrambled? Fill in the blanks with your own fears. Pop some corn. Enjoy."
" It's All In The Brilliant Acting For This One, Folks
",0.5859,0.9174,2017-09-20 00:00:00,10,"Has there ever been a perfect film? People say CASABLANCA was close. I've seen it--maybe need to see it again. Anyway, what impressed me the most with this truly horrifying non-narrative was the acting. The actors chosen for this story are utterly brilliant, whether they are speaking or not. My favorite acting scene? When Kat (Kiernan Shipka) is talking with her priest friend near the beginning of the film. There is so much pain in her expression, her aloofness. She needs love; a father figure, and Shipka conveys these saddening emotions perfectly. Later it is evident that Kat wants to admire Rose (Lucy Boynton) as being one of the older girls at their private school, but Rose treats her like a stupid freshman--an action which blends nicely with her murderous attitude towards the child she believes she is carrying of very recent. Still, Kat cries out to Rose for love and protection, but Rose refuses to give what she can evidently afford. The hatred of demons for all of mankind, despite social status, is well understood by director Oz Perkins--and this includes hatred of the possessed as well, though the latter longs for the possession as a way of feeling loved and protected. That alone is a fresh approach to films made about demonic possession. There are gory murder scenes here, and some foul language which is not gratuitous but necessary to move the story along. Perkins also understands understatement and gnomic suggestions, like when a gentleman gazes a certain way at a forlorn girl he has just met, making the viewer suddenly wonder if he has an ulterior motive behind his kindness. There's even a Roald Dahl reference--witch for it."
" Excellently Shot & Acted
",0.6249,-0.1779,2017-09-19 00:00:00,9,"A beautiful, dark story of true Christianity, and true demonic activity. There is abandonment here, and need for love, and terror, and horror, and non-narrative. Not often does a film disturb me like this one does--and I am a published writer of Horror. Watch this one more than once."
" Atmospheric, but if you think about it it's no more than poor man's ""The Shining""
",-0.8109,-0.5756,2017-09-16 00:00:00,6,"The Blackcoat's Daughter is one of those slow-burn, but creepy and atmospheric horror movies. It's about these two girls who stay over winter break at their boarding school, one of them descents into madness and gets possessed and there is also this girl who escaped asylum played by Emma Roberts who tries to get to that school. How it all comes together, see for yourself.Starts off very creepy and gets under your skin, so I was really looking forward to seeing what it was gonna become. But it just kinda falls apart and doesn't tie together so well (for example, the possession felt really random). The story is essentially a poor man's version of The Shining with some other random stuff thrown in the mix. The performances are good and the mood is pretty nice, but with a poor script, it just doesn't work as well as it could have. A slow-burn creepy horror movie is always a refreshment to see in the sea of lazy jump-scare cash-grabs, but this isn't one of those great indie horror movies. It has the feel, but not much else."
" Couldn't finish halfway through... Extremely boring and painful to watch.
",-0.6962,-0.9958,2017-09-01 00:00:00,1,"I love horror films, especially dark twisted ones like The Shining, The silence of the lambs, Psycho, and The Exorcist. I saw a good review on this film and thought ""Oh well, this might be as good as these classic films..."". But I was wrong. Sure it's supposed to be one of these modern -esque indie horror films, that takes place in a deserted location at the peak of the cold winter. These types of movies that I least enjoy, but I thought of giving this movie a shot. Needless to say, I yawned 10 minutes in. 1- Poor dialogue that makes absolutely no sense.2- Useless shots from angles that don't add anything to the plot.3- Pathetic attempt of jump scares. 4- Abhorrent themes and characters. 5- Pointless scenes of absolute nonsense. 6- Poor acting.7- Dull, eerie atmosphere.I simply couldn't finish the movie after 50 minutes of it, it was utterly boring and mundane. If you enjoy soft-core indie horror films you might enjoy it at the least, it'll make you scroll down your phone out of lack of interest."
" Unbelievably boring!
",-0.4376,-0.8239,2017-08-30 00:00:00,1,"I think the death knell for a movie is if it's considered boring. And this movie bored me to tears! But beyond the tedium of nothing happening for the first half of the movie, was a host of other problems. Who wrote this script? At one point, one of the character's says ""cellular phone."" In my world, and probably yours, people call it a cell phone for short. Unrealistic speech by all of the characters, permeates this film. Then there is confusion on who these girls are, where they're coming from, where they're going, why they're going there, etc. And it's NOT scary! Not at all. So AVOID this movie, and save yourself some time and money."
" Slow and boring
",-0.3182,0.754,2017-08-20 00:00:00,1,"I saw the 68% Metacritic reviews and thought, ""that's high for a horror movie!"" Also the 5.8 on IMDb is not too bad for a horror movie. OK, let's watch.What you get is a painfully slow possession movie. The possession that takes place is comically similar to Donnie Darko (which is actually a lot more nuanced and frightening), but there's no actual mechanics to the possession. One girl gets possessed apparently talking on the phone, and seeing a furry bunny rabbit ear shadow (ahem, I mean, ""devil's horns""). The other girl is, well, just ""possessed"" from the beginning. There is a time sequence that promises to put things together in this confusing film, but does not. The film has about 2 or 3 real ""scare"" scenes (and yes, it does include several pointless ""jump scares"" which make zero sense whatsoever). If you want to see a slow-burning, but CONVINCING and CREEPY possession movie (not necessarily by the Devil, with the horns and everything, as this schlock shows), then watch ""Session 9"". This film blows. I guess I now have to be wary of (a) virgin directors; and (b) Metacritic reviewers. I am beginning to think that the Metacritic (and other pro-reviewers) are scrambling for a career that they are willing to overrate everything (like Gene Shalit) just to ""get in good"" somehow with the film world. They are actually either afraid, or too stupid, to do their jobs as ""critics"" and criticize what does not work in a movie.Let me tell you, when you see a movie with a lot of pointless scenes that eat time, such as girls sitting up in bed and staring, or looking at the quarters in one hand before one makes a payphone call (TWICE this pointless scene appeared), then you know the director is a rank amateur who thinks the atmospheric effects, music and minimalism will suffice in the place of an authentically creepy idea and execution. Scenes cannot be POINTLESS and eat time, as this ponderous bore-fest loves to pour on us, which is ironic, considering it tries to be so minimalist. Skip unless you are satisfied with extreme minimalism, zero exposition, and some creepy music and atmospherics."
" B.D. Sucks
",-0.3612,-0.7424,2017-08-14 00:00:00,3,"Really? Genius to film in cold vacant scenario? Ragged, Loose, ever rising never Arriving, at best script? Look, this movie is a B rated film students best effort. Get High, get couple of chills, but this ain't your Halloween - The Thrill Comes Home flick! I recommend going back and putting in a few serious connecting strands of dialog between Kat and the ever growing tension between her going stark raving mad and the ""Head Master""!"
" Playing games with time...and The Devil
",-0.5574,-0.8493,2017-08-07 00:00:00,4,"No matter how much narrative trickery a film uses, that's never enough to make up for a lame story, and that's exactly what's on display here.It also doesn't help matters when the story presents itself as a Thriller, and without any foreshadowing at all, suddenly devolves into a supernatural story involving demonic possession in its climactic third act.And I could almost even overlook the ominous ambient sound design obviously ripped-off from David Lynch if it weren't for the gimmicky pretentious components mentioned above.I do think the lead actors did good work, though...it's just too bad they had to support such a simplistic and juvenile story that tried to disguise itself as something that was deep and artsy.4/10"
" I don't think the director understands horror/suspense
",0.0,0.7543,2017-07-20 00:00:00,3,"These days when a movie is under 100 minutes I feel like it will be tightly plotted or stretched beyond its story. This one is definitely the latter where there's enough to fill a 20 minute short but no more than that.Everything technically is fine. The cinematography is decent, the sound design and music is respectable but it never becomes a movie. It's like he watched a few horror movies and made a checklist as he included all the usual things.The story is non-existent and there's huge chunks of time where no one is speaking or doing much of anything. Walking slowly down a hallway, that's a scene that happens a few times. Sitting in bed. That's a scene that happens a few times. I never got a sense that the director understood how to create suspense he just was like ""Oh and creepy violin screech goes here, they say or do something weird there, some people get murdered and boom we got a horror movie"".Don't watch this. I wouldn't even say it's a good try because it's definitely made by a competent director; he's just playing around in a genre that he doesn't understand at all."
" It is not so funny
",-0.464,-0.1603,2017-07-17 00:00:00,6,"I have no definite idea what I just watched, so let's call it art house. I have an inkling as to what happened, I may give you unintentional PLOT SPOILERS. The story centers on three, maybe four, maybe two girls at Bramford school in upstate New York in February. We first meet Katherine who has a premonition of her parents having an auto accident, missing parent's day. Katherine is insecure, creepy, and melancholy. Then there is Rose who may or may not be pregnant and gosh, may or may not be dead, although I don't know if the film was in chronological order or flashback or what. We then meet Joan, played by the same person as Katherine who is in a different location traveling in the direction of the school. So they can't be the same, right? Then there is Kat, played by someone different than Katherine, but has all of her memories...and oh yes the nuns are said to worship Satan in the basement and have all their hair shaved off. The film moves slow and creepy with a soundtrack that made me think I was watching something crazy, like Twin Peaks.My take on what I watched...PLOT SPOILERS. Katherine was the illegitimate daughter of the headmaster (hence the title) and had no parents. She is possessed by a demon and after her demise, that demon goes to Kat. The subplot is a flash forward with Katherine being a ghost or something which really doesn't make sense either. Good Luck.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity"
" A Great and Atmospheric Horror Movie
",0.1027,-0.9818,2017-07-15 00:00:00,8,"I knew nothing about this movie. Didn't see a trailer or read anything about it which in a perfect world would be the best way anybody should see this film. The movie creates a certain sense of unease and dread right from the get go. The Sound design of the film is very effective in helping to create an atmosphere of impending unease and terror. It very ""Lynchian"" in its approach to sound. The performances are low key and understated. (Start of Spoiler)Even when Kat becomes possessed its a quiet affair. Just stillness and stares and some dark eye makeup. There is one scene that in which we Kat in bed and obviously she is possessed by the devil because she contorts her body backwards. This is the one effect I wish would have been left out. We have seen this effect before and in much lesser movies. It also doesn't help that the effect is not done very well. But that aside,... (End of Spoiler)the movie keeps you guessing as what its all about and what happens next. The ending is well done and give a convincing closure to the story and why the things happened in the second half of the film. Its a sad and devastating ending. The pace of the film is deliberate and not a breakneck scare a minute bullshit horror movie which I guess explains the low rating it gets here in IMDb. If you like atmosphere and some truly shocking psychological and visual horror you have to see this film. There are not many horror movies that affect me as much as this one has."
" Gory Is the Winger
",0.0,0.9633,2017-07-09 00:00:00,7,"It has been very interesting to conscientiously see the first film of a filmmaker whose second work I admired immensely. That's my experience with ""February"" (or ""The Blackcoat's Daughter"", as it was renamed at the request of the distributor that launched the product in March 2017 through limited exhibitions in cinemas, two years after its praised tour through several film festivals) and Osgood Perkins, whose ""I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House"" I first saw. I believe that in his debut feature, a story of psychological distortion with hints of Satanism, Perkins unleashed his tastes and concerns, which were put much under control in his next work. In both films, a feeling of desolation and loss prevails, as the filmmaker said in an interview, that ""the best scary movies are sad movies"". Here the story does not focus on adult women, like the nurse and the writer in ""I Am the Pretty Thing..."", but on three teenagers with serious emotional problems: one, apparently psychic, who intuits the death of her parents and has become the target of the ""Evil One""; a beautiful nymphet, who suspects that she is pregnant; and a disturbed girl, seemingly a runaway from a mental institution. The central meeting point of the three women is a school where Satan seeks the unwary, just as in ""Pretty Thing..."" everything merges in the house where a ""pretty ectoplasm"" refuses to leave the space. But if in the ghost story, measure, contention, and scarce musical commentary by Elvis Perkins (the director's brother) were the norm, in ""February"", despite calculated performances, observational shots of precise duration and correct tempo, something gets out of hand. In my personal experience, two things made too much noise: the reiteration of shots of empty stairs and corridors whose anodyne effect strongly surfaces with Perkins' persistent sounds, and that sticky gore that is sought after with pleasure by the avid consumers of everything ""deep red"". But there is no doubt that Osgood Perkins' inauguration in genre film was promising and confirmed with ""I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House"", and merits viewing, with good performances by the three leading actresses (Kiernan Shipka, Lucy Boynton and Emma Roberts) and the secondary cast, plus beautiful cinematography by Julie Kirkwood, all shot in the dead of northern winter."
" Not my fav
",-0.357,-0.2878,2017-07-07 00:00:00,3,I am a horror fan and was pleased to find this indie suspense movie listed on the top films of the year so far for 2017. I was equally surprised to find it on Amazon prime. It is bland and dull. The three main girls are all so waifish and depressed looking that its difficult to tell them apart. Half way through I was still trying to figure out their names and why I should be interested in them. I cannot give this a recommendation.
" I think my expectations were too high, or this movie just missed the mark.
",-0.296,-0.9977,2017-07-05 00:00:00,4,"The Blackcoat's Daughter, originally titled February, was a film that received quite some buzz during it's initial screenings at film festivals back in 2015. It eventually got a quiet release in limited theatrical screenings in February (of course) 2017 before its home release. As a connoisseur of horror films, I was intrigued (even though I dislike Emma Roberts) especially because despite its derivative themes of demonic possession, the film apparently does new things with the formula. Bought it day one and I have to say I was kind of disappointed.In a boarding school, students Katherine ""Kat"" (Kiernan Shipka) and Rose (Lucy Boynton) stay behind during school break while the other girls leave with their families. Kat's parents don't come because they are deceased while Rose intentionally gave her parents the wrong date, she suspects that she might be pregnant and doesn't yet want to face her parents about it. The third girl, ""Joan"" (Emma Roberts), is a mystery as she gets off on a bus stop and is implied to be an escaped mental patient as she removes her hospital bracelet in the bathroom. She is soon picked up by an elderly couple (James Remar and Lauren Holly) who mention that they are on their way to the boarding school.Watching the film I was underwhelmed because it is hollow and has no soul. It's plenty creepy with looming hallways and dark spaces but there's never anything here that's actually frightening. Kat is orphaned and as a result is supposed to be metaphorically raised by darkness because she summons a demon in the boiler room after Rose taunts her with a story that the nuns are satanists and worship demons. I never once got the indication that Kat was lonely, sure she looks gloomy but she's like that for the entire movie even before we find out what happened, she never grieves her parents and never looks lost and desperate. She has no character arc or any semblance of a personality. It makes it hard to believe that she'd befriend the demon out of loneliness as a result, the demon itself also doesn't have a threatening presence. I never got chills of dread about the demon or what it's capable of, it isn't unnerving and almost feels like a plot device threaded thorough the film so that the movie can exist.Rose is equally as uninteresting and hollow. Her entire character is just her hanging out with her boyfriend and interacting with Kat for a small conversation. I understand why she stayed behind but the problem is that I know it but I don't feel it. Rose never once looks anxious or panicked about the possibility of being pregnant, if you didn't catch it the first time you would probably never pick up on it. There's also never any friction or tension when she is with her boyfriend over the fact that he might have gotten her pregnant. She has no arc and never becomes involved in the plot as anything more than another plot device. In the third act she finally has her period, much to her relief, and is suddenly killed by a possessed Kat after she also murdered the nuns, and offers their decapitated heads as an offering to the demon before she is blasted with a shotgun by the police and sent to an institution. No resolution, nothing, her death carries no meaning because she never had any either as a character.This leads me to my next point, the ""big"" twist in the film is that ""Joan"" is actually an older Kat after she escaped the asylum and has returned to the town 9 years later to return to the boarding school and is actually picked up by Rose's parents who are heading to the school to place flowers at her grave. The glaring problems with this twist is that it's pretty obvious. Joan/Kat is never in the same scene with the other girls and exists in her own subplot completely separated from the boarding school. While Joan/Kat is showering, we can see a shotgun wound on her shoulder where Kat was shot before the twist is revealed, she also looks extremely similar to Kat in terms of hair color and facial appearance. The dead giveaway is that in the diner scene with Joan/Kat and Rose's father, he reveals that their daughter Rose died 9 years earlier and shows her a picture of her before Joan/Kat heads to the bathroom and starts to giggle before we see the driver's license of the woman she killed and stole it from, who was named Joan Marsh.The film clumsily ends with her killing the parents in their car before decapitating them and taking the heads to the now closed down boarding school. She again offers the heads as a sacrifice in the boiler room and yet nothing happens. She walks out in despair and starts to cry uncontrollably. The point you were supposed to get was that she is lonely and wanted the demon back, because she was exorcised by a priest before she was institutionalized and wanted it to stay with her. There's no raw emotions to this scene because we never got a sense of desperation or loneliness from Kat, the exorcism scene is the only time in the whole film she expresses her attachment to the demon. With no emotional knowledge of the situation there's no impact.This film reminds me of Proxy, both have loosely attached events with a scattered plot messily clashed together with no semblance or fluidity to it. The few redeeming qualities I saw are the eerie and beautiful winter setting, the unnerving music, and the cinematography is somewhat creepy. But otherwise this movie is soulless and has no weight attached to it. It's forgettable. I still recommend you check it out if you're curious, just temper your expectations because it isn't as good as you'd hope it is."

They think they do, but they do not. They will go on and on about pretentiousness and snobbish art with no substance, but that's just not true. Don't listen to them. The gloom and doom and sense of loss are once again evident and profound in this masterpiece. Not a character was wasted. Every one of them was interesting and had something to say.

" An atmospheric Hitchcockian nightmare horror treat
",-0.25,-0.962,2017-06-21 00:00:00,8,"Atmospheric horror movies are few and far between in the era of the modern Hollywood blockbuster and you seldom get a chance to see them in theaters. This movie is one of those rare little horror treats you hear about, decide to see and not regret spending an hour and a half with it, and the creepy and tense feeling remains in your stomach for a few days after watching it.When I realized this movie was directed by the son of horror icon Anthony Perkins, the Hitchcockian connection was even clearer to me. This is apparently Oz Perkins' first horror movie and he creates and absolute antithesis the James Wan-influenced modern horror industry tropes, which obviously elevates the movie above the lowest common denominator, which might explain the polarizing response.However, if you crave a slow-building plot, some excellent aspects such as choice of background music and inspired shot composition, this is the movie for you. Quite similar to the surprise offering of 2016 named The VVitch, the plot is a descent into chaos, the story slowly but surely leading you to some interesting guess-work, only to surprise you at every step. This is one of the few modern horror movies where directing, editing and screen writing have a magical synergy.This is a must-watch horror movie for all aspiring movie directors, and a great nostalgic trip to the comforting yet at the same time disconcerting horror movie. I look forward to Mr. Perkins further horror offerings. A perfect counterbalance to the rash of modern fast-paced modern horror movies that have sold their soul to the Devil of Jump-Scares."
" A masterpiece of dread and minimalist storytelling. A film that leaves you stunned and in terror.
",-0.4019,0.9361,2017-06-15 00:00:00,9,"The best kind of horror; the kind that doesn't scare you, but fills you with dread. One of only a handful of movies that can make that claim, right alongside The Witch (2015).The score is the standout of this film. One of the most disturbing and perfectly placed soundtracks that somehow takes conservative and deliberate filmmaking and give it a life of its own.The dialog is sparse but well written and well delivered, hardly a wasted line, demonstrating that less can be so much more.The supernatural elements, while present, are underplayed to great effect, leaving you to wonder if they are actually there at all or mere suggestion.If you are patient and attentive this movie will reward you richly. Recommended."
" Nonlinear Bore
",-0.25,0.887,2017-06-11 00:00:00,4,"It seems that these days there are a number of young directors and writers who were raised on the gore fest of the 80s and 90s that have found the need to try and legitimize the genre by taking similar types of stories and repainting them in artistic pieces instead. I'm not sure if it's a fear of being associated with the genre for future projects or trying to lead it into a direction where it can be taken seriously. What they're missing is the fact that those movies were made not to be hailed as artistic highlights but pure escapism, a way to dodge the art house films and have a full on blast at the movies. Case in point THE BLACKCOAT'S DAUGHTER.The movie opens with freshman Kat (Kiernan Shipka), a strange young girl at a boarding school, who seems to have an infatuation with the priest who is also the headmaster. He's going away for the holidays which disappoints her since she's performing for the class and he will miss it. Instead she'll wait patiently for her parents to arrive late as well who will then take her home for the holiday.Concurrent with this story is that of Rose (Lucy Boynton), a senior at the same school who is also waiting for the late arrival of her parents as well and placed in charge of looking after Kat. The difference between the two is that Rose is actually staying behind to meet with her boyfriend to discuss the fact that she may be pregnant so she put off her parents coming.Sneaking out and leaving Kat behind Rose returns to find her missing. Searching the building, listening to noises emanating from the heating system, Rose tracks Kat down to the basement of the building, bowing up and down in front of the furnace as if in worship. She takes her back to her room and tries to calm her down but Kat is now odder than before.As this story unfolds we are introduced to another character, Joan (Emma Roberts), a young girl who exits a bus with no apparent means to support herself or the trip she is on. We get glimpses of her in a hospital for what appears to be the insane and see her tear off a hospital wrist band in the bathroom of the bus station. Joan receives and offer for a ride from Bill (James Remar) and his wife Linda (Lauren Holly) who take sympathy on her.As the few days the story takes place move forward, Kat begins to act more strange than when she was first introduced, something Rose notes but make no mention of but the two older women left in charge of the school notice right away. A combination of foul language and improper behavior while saying grace concerns them all.Back to Bill, Linda and Joan. We're not quite sure what is up with Bill. Has he truly taken a sympathetic interest in Joan or is there something more deviant going on here? When he tells her the story of his daughter who died years earlier and says she looks just like her, is it wishful thinking on her part or is this a sinister secret he's sharing with her, something that happened better left unsaid.This might sound like an interesting movie with some scares that are indeed genuine but unfortunately my description is better than the movie itself. It turns out the story is unfolding in non-linear movie time. This means that the story is being told in bits and pieces not in the order things happen but back and forth in time to suit the needs of the director and author who use it to both confuse and to attempt to create a more artistic vision for the viewer. Instead it leaves you confused and wondering just what is really going on until perhaps the last 30 minutes of the film.From a technical aspect the movie is well made with some great cinematography on display. The performances are well done with Shipka providing a truly creepy character while at the same time offering little emotion in her performance. But none of that can save this movie.The worst two items to be seen are the way the story is told to begin with and the music. This non-linear form doesn't help the story but just makes it confusing. If that was the intent then the film makers here succeeded. If they were trying to make an interesting story they failed. The music is so overused here as to interfere with the story rather than assist it. Every time something unusual happens the music gets more mysterious than what we're looking and swells to a volume as to force you to pay attention to it rather than the story.I had hopes for this movie having read the description of what it was about. Instead I got a movie that made me realize far too many new horror films are filled with this dependence on music, slow story telling that doesn't unravel a mystery so much as drag it along and the end results of these films as being less horrifying and more torture to sit through. My suggestion is wait to watch this until it shows up on Netflix or the Chiller Channel and only then if you must."
" A Final Act That Will Haunt Your Nights
",-0.4019,-0.6686,2017-06-03 00:00:00,10,"Its best to know as little about the plot as possible before seeing this. I will say that a few scenes toward the end remind me of that infamous scene from Insidious involving a shadowy figure standing in the corner of the room. One vague spoiler I will give is that it is a satanic horror movie. The entire movie has the vibe of a fever dream that slowly gets worse and worse until the very end. Here are a few things to know before seeing this movie. 1.  It is a slow burner that builds on brooding atmosphere rather than constant jump scares 2.  You have to pay close attention, so have little distractions or don't be too lazy to press rewind if you missed something. 3.  The final 30 mins will haunt your nightmares so be sure to play it extra loud for extra effect. 4.  You MUST watch it more than once. If any of those things aren't what you're looking for in a horror movie, then skip this so you don't end up trashing it afterwards. Otherwise, enjoy this future cult classic loud and in the dark. I personally think this is one of the best and scariest horror films in a long time.*PS spoiler* I will even go as far as to call this a modern day spiritual successor to The Witch. Yes there is a Black Philip-esque entity in the mix."

",0.0,0.6369,2017-06-03 00:00:00,2,"Slow burn doesn't even begin to describe this movie, 30 minutes in and hardly anything has happened, no real story, no plot, flat two dimensional characters. I saw one reviewer saying if you like movies like It Follows then you'll like this movie, which is probably true because I found that movie tired and predictable with two dimensional characters as well. While it does attempt to add atmosphere and mood for me, at least, it falls flat even on that attempt. And finally it's yet another horror that has far too many religious notes for my taste. The one redeeming value the score was quite well done if you want suspense watch some classic Hitchkok or even old Scooby-Doo cartoons."

" About the two girls who stayed behind on their school break.
",0.0,-0.6647,2017-05-14 00:00:00,5,"Also known as 'February', is about two teen girls from closely, but a different timeline. It was the boarding school break and everyone heading their home, but a couple of girls stay behind as they have no other choice. While waiting for their parents to pick them up, those few days do not go well with them. What it is and how the story ends, you should watch it to learn.It is not a must see, or even it does not look fresh enough. Though very dark and there's a moment it peaks with its suspense. But it could not hold any further, or keep us expecting what might come. Both the tales that told parallely was distinguished at the end with a small twist. But not everything was fully explained. So you will be disappointed a bit on that ground on overall film.Those young actresses were really good. Roberts and Shipka who never meet given the best performances in their respective roles. An horror with a less traditional narration. Feels familiar, but not really as entirely. Because if you don't know what its genre, you could anticipate a regular drama-thriller, but they manipulated the genre very well that you won't fully able to unpuzzle, even after the end. Just one time watchable film, in a common sense, but there are people who like this kind of film better than usual horror films.5/10"

I have to applaud the screen writing effort, and the acting in the movie is also brilliant. You felt the stakes with each and every character. I believe this is Oz Perkins directorial debut and it was a fantastic effort on his part and as well of the whole production. I would highly recommend this movie for anybody interested in any type of suspense...or for that matter, just like good films!"

" flat
",0.0,0.3291,2017-05-02 00:00:00,5,"It's February at the Bramford School, an upstate New York Catholic boarding school for girls. Most of the students and staff are leaving for winter holidays. Katherine (Kiernan Shipka) is haunted by dreams of her parents who have not been in contact. Rose (Lucy Boynton) thinks that she may be pregnant. Rose is asked to look out for the freshman Katherine while most everyone is away. At another place, Joan (Emma Roberts) has escaped from a mental hospital and sitting outside the bus station in the freezing cold. Bill (James Remar) with his wife Linda (Lauren Holly) are passing by and takes her in.This is rather flat and slow. The story of Katherine and Rose is almost inevitable. The Joan part does have one creepy scene of her in a towel. This movie has two big revelations. They need to be foreshadowed earlier and better. This could be Donnie Darko but that figure needs to be presented right from the start. It would have added to the creepy atmosphere. The writing is there but the filmmaking is lacking."
" Creepy, Atmospheric Chiller
",0.0,0.9591,2017-04-17 00:00:00,9,"The Blackcoat's Daughter is one of those really polarizing horror films: either you love it or you turn it off after watching for 30 minutes with no gore or jump scares. It's definitely a slow burn, but rewards attention with its gorgeous cinematography, excellent performances and chilling final moments: there is definitely a body count near the end. I can't tell much about the plot without giving out spoilers, but the story follows three young women as their lives converge in a near-deserted Catholic girls school in upstate New York during winter. I really like the way the possible supernatural element is handled: it could be all in the fevered imagination of one of the characters. There's no distracting CGI monster, just a terrifying shadow glimpsed in the corner of a dorm room or in the reflection of bathroom tiles. Extra props are due to the unnerving sound design and austere, perfectly framed cinematography. If you like atmospheric, chilling horror that makes you think, the Blackcoat's Daughter is well worth the time."

I just think the film makers got a little lost when it came to actually editing a plot which connected.?!"
" The Blackcoat's Daughter (2015)
",0.0,0.9885,2017-04-01 00:00:00,7,"Here's one that's been around since 2015 but for some reason A24 pushed back its release till 2017 on video on demand. I'm a fan of Emma Roberts so I thought watching her in a horror film would be worth checking out (since I enjoyed her in Scream 4). Release date flub aside, I think this was a solid film. Its a slow build but I think the film is quite atmospheric and is mysterious enough to keep you engaged and inquisitive all the way through.It'll be hard to actually describe the plot of this film without actually spoiling key aspects of the film. The film revolves around three young girls in a setting of a Catholic school and grizzly murders that take place. Let's also say that demonic possession is in the play in the film. While that may sound generic, the film manages to stay refreshing throughout. Its a slow burn but the build is impressive. You start to wonder where the puzzles fit into place and once you finish the film you can't help but feel impressed with what was witnessed.Kiernan Shipka is definitely a talent. She was honestly one of the best parts of Mad Men playing a feisty and rather complex Sally Draper. I then saw her hold her own in the remake of Flowers in the Attic. I think she'll be in much more. A combo of Roberts and Shipka (who aren't really ever on the screen together) were able to bring forth an independent horror/thriller effort that gives the viewers a fun experience. Its not exactly scary, but I think is impressive in its own right for how its able to suck in viewers with minimum effort.7/10"
" The Darkest Masterpiece of Horror in a Long Time
",-0.4215,-0.0881,2017-03-30 00:00:00,9,"Wow; just...WOW! I was a little hesitant about watching this. Bored and unable to sleep, I watched this On-Demand at 2:30 a.m. I never dozed for one second, and was left thinking why cannot more horror movies be like this?""The Blackcoat's Daughter"" (originally entitled ""February"") is about two young girls who attend an all-girl boarding school. In one day, it will be Spring break, and everyone is excited about what that may bring. Well, everyone except Kat (superbly played by Kiernan Shipica). She has a very foreboding dream the reason her parents have not arrived is because they have been killed in an auto accident.Rose, a second student, has lied to her parents about when they should come for her for a special reason. She has just found out she is pregnant and wants to tell her boyfriend. Bad move.Then there is Joan, expertly played by Emma Roberts, who has just escaped from a psychiatric hospital and is drawn somewhere for reasons she doesn't originally understand. All of these girls' paths finally intersect in an ending that left me limp.It has been a very long time since I have seen an actual horror movie that I found disturbing AND scary. Last year's ""The Witch"" was a shining example of psychological horror, and I have stated time and time again, you do not have to have a screen awash in blood to scare an audience. The acting, scenery, direction, cinematography, and ESPECIALLY the music makes ""The Blackcoat's Daughter"" one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. The acting is leaps and bound above what is usually found in these types of movies, and the picture is a masterpiece visually. The reason I changed my rating from 10 to 9 is because of one of my biggest gripes: CGI ""monsters."" C'mon on guys, it's hard to be scared of a devil that looks like a dust bunny. Rated ""R"" for violence and disturbing images, I cannot say enough good things about ""The Blackcoat's Daughter."""
" This was genuinely creepy....BUT.....
",0.0,-0.9954,2017-03-29 00:00:00,7,"In the first five minutes of the film when a spirit (or demon) shows her that her parents have been killed on their way to pick her up, I knew this would be chilling. It sets the stage for Kat's vulnerability, for as we know from horror films, the demon strikes when we are emotionally frail. Her schoolmate who is rather cruel to her in the beginning, sets the stage for conflict and pent-up anger and makes you sympathetic to Kat (as if losing her parents didn't already do that for you). She slowly begins to change, and while this is happening, Joan comes onto the scene after escaping an asylum (yup, we've seen this). Her character is very complex, and I don't want to divulge. I was never bored during this - it is spine-chilling. But there is nothing particularly clever about it and the gratuitous violence in the last half hour really turned me off - I felt it had changed gears and become a campy slasher film. I gave it a 7 because it was quite scary, however, I don't like how it changed gears from being a psychological horror film to a bloody severed head count. The demon-bunny looked ridiculous. But with that being said, it was a scary movie. Unlike other viewers, I failed to see echoes of The Shining. It did however, remind me of Scandi-Noir films, with it's bleak setting, quiet, but unsettling characters and ominous tone. If you like ""Let Me In"" and ""Keeper of Lost Secrets"", you will probably enjoy this one. It did edit my review to more stars because this movie stayed with me and got under my skin - despite the demon bunny."
" Haunting, chilling slow burn horror flick, will stick in your head for a while..
",-0.7096,-0.9988,2017-03-20 00:00:00,9,"Let me first start off this review with saying that if you are not a fan of slow burn style horror films, this may not be your cup of tea. This movie is not your run of the mill horror film, with cheap scares, or tons of constant gore. To begin, let me just say that the atmosphere throughout this entire movie is wonderful..something about the locations they picked, and the general atmosphere that is just great. The cinematography is simply beautiful as well. The shots used for this film are perfect to set the tone of the movie. In a sense, this movie starts off rather slow. The pacing is a bit slower than most horror films, but for good reasoning. As this movie continues on, things get more and more dreadful, and disturbing. The general idea of this film, is that two girls who attend a religious boarding school are stuck there alone over their winter break, awaiting their parents arrival. What seems like a normal place, becomes increasingly disturbing and quite haunting. The way in which this film builds up tension is very effective. Our two lead characters, Kathryn and rose, are very different and not friends by any means, but they are stuck together while everyone else has departed for winter break. Rose seems annoyed with Kathryn throughout the movie, because she is younger, and also a bit needy. As the film goes on, Kathryn's behavior seems to get more and more strange. As the story unfolds with Rose and Kathryn, another story is shown that seems to be happening at the same time. A young girl, Joan, who is all alone, sits at a bus stop in the winter weather, appearing cold and distressed. An older man who is nearby for some reason, sees Joan and proceeds to ask her if she is okay, or needs help, she is not very respondent to the man. After some convincing, she agrees to go with him and his wife who is waiting in their car nearby. They proceed to drive where the man says he will take her to the town shes needing to get to, on the way they stop at a hotel. The girl continually has flashbacks, those of which are unclear as to what is happening in them. we then shift back to Rose and Kathryn. Rose had left with her apparent boyfriend, to inform him she is pregnant, leaving Kathryn behind by herself. Upon Rose returning, she finds Kathryn in the boiler room, moving strangely, in a way, flailing in front of the lit boiler. Rose takes Kat back up to her room, and tucks her into bed, assuring her that her parents will show up, upon doing so, Kat makes a statement inferring that her parents are dead. Rose is disturbed by this, but brushes it off. We go back to Joan, and the man Bill. They sit at a diner together, preparing to eat. Bill tells Joan she reminds of him of his deceased daughter, Rose. Joan excuses herself, and proceeds to go to the bathroom. while in the bathroom, Joan has a flashback of strangling a nurse in a psych ward named Joan, and stealing her identity. When leaving the bathroom, Joan sees a cop talking to bill, she grabs a nearby knife from a bus tray. Bill informs her they need to leave because of a big storm coming, they leave the diner, and proceed to continue driving toward their destination. it is now morning, and we go back to Rose and Kat. They proceed to join the two school nurses for breakfast, while they are saying grace, Kat appears to giggle inappropriately. When they discipline Kat, she then gets sick and vomits. This moment is when things get very disturbing. As the nurses try to assist Kat, she lashes out and says ""get your hands off me, cu*nt"". At this moment it is clear that something is very wrong with Kat. The nurses tell Rose to shovel the driveway, she does so, then goes back to her bed and lays down. Now in a flashback, it shows Kat brutally stabbing the two nurses to death, and proceeding to decapitate them. Rose checks on her pregnancy test in the bathroom, while doing so, she hears someone enter the bathroom, then leave. she looks. but no one is around. Upon entering the hallway, Rose sees two bloody decapitated heads wrapped in sheets, Kat appears and then brutally stabs Rose to death, also decapitating her. A police officer finds Kat in the boiler room, surrounded by the three decapitated heads, in some sort of ritual. Still wielding the knife, she turns to the cop and proceeds to say ""Hail Satan!"" Ignoring the cops orders, she rushes him and is then shot. we go back to the car, with Joan, bill and his wife. Bills wife reveals to Joan that their daughter, rose was murdered and decapitated 9 years earlier. Joan tells bill she is going to be sick, instructing him to pull over. Upon pulling over, Joan grabs Bill, slashing his throat, and then stabs his wife to death. She decapitates them both, and takes their heads in a suitcase to the bordering school, which is now closed. At this point, we realize Joan, is actually an older Kat. she takes the heads to the boiler room, and looks for the beast she had originally been seeing, who seemingly has possessed her when she was a young Kathryn."

Great job in the sound department.Those who have not witnessed Kiernan Shipka's talent in ""Mad Men"" will surely find here some convincing material to make up their minds. The other two main actresses were also remarkable, however for exclusively aesthetic reasons, I must add.Concerning the plot, I believe it is important to emphasize its non linear nature : a key element to reconstruct the overall ""Stimmung"".I must criticize the trailer, despite having been convinced by it to approach the movie in the first place; the allusions to ""erotic charge"" are deeply misleading and cast a negative influence on the viewers, distracting them from the main, yet hidden, theme of the movie : the Occult. I rarely experienced a more discrete and effectively symbolic handling of such a complicated and debated matter. The way the Occult's first appearance on the scene is connected to the principal plot twist is also deeply satisfying. The final scenes also need to be focused on : they both bring the missing pieces in the plot and offer an open, surprising end.My only critic would regard the excessive abundance of implicit hermeticism : some traits of the story could and should have been properly expanded (Kat's parents, some more details about Rose, a more complete view of the boarding school, the true origins of Kat's ""sickness"", just to make a few examples)."

" I haven't seen a horror movie this good in a while...
",0.7094,-0.5321,2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"I just finished watching THE BLACKCOATS DAUGHTER.First, I had no idea what this film was about and didn't read any reviews or watch any trailers. It is rare that I see a movie without knowing anything about it. I recommend not looking into what this movie is about before watching. It will be a pleasantly horrific surprise. The cinematography and score give it an incredibly David Lynch mood similar to Twin Peaks and very much film noir, and oh so unsettling. The long camera stills on character's faces creates an uncomfortable tension and an awkward closeness to what is happening in the film. I felt like I was feeling what the characters were feeling and it was really scary. I have to mention the score alone was incredibly eerie which set the mood magnificently for this film. I felt the score was so well-matched to what was happening in the film, almost to the same degree as score of The Shining. In fact, the build up in this film reminded me of a lot of The Shining.I like that every viewer can have a completely different experience because the story line is a bit vague. Not to the point where you have no idea what is going on, rather you are eagerly grasping every hint thrown your way. I felt like I wanted to figure the plot out before it was ultimately revealed and I kept trying but I didn't manage to which was refreshing, especially because it wasn't a huge plot twist with a crazy 180 degree unexpected turn. It made sense afterwards and I was completely satisfied. This is a slow burn with a build-up of dread that quite literally gave me anxiety. I think the pacing of this film might turn off some viewers as there aren't many jump scares. It is so incredibly dark and ominous. If I had seen this a couple weeks ago it would have made it into top slot for sure. This movie psychologically scared (and probably scarred) me and I have a feeling it will stick with me for quite some time. I am still like, ""what did I just watch?"" And of course I watched it when I was home aloneI think the negative reviews are by people who expected a lame horror movie with jump scares where everything is spelled out for you and you don't need to think much while watching.If you liked movies like ""It Follows"", ""The Witch"", and ""Absentia"" then you'll probably love this."
