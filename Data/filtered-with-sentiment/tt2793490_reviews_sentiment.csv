" Deal with the Devil
",-0.6597,0.7488,2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Every Hollywood celeb/ athlete/Rap/pop star etc has to make a choice, very rarely do they realize the magnitude of what it really takes to make it famous and what they are signing up for. Sure this is fiction , as was 'Rosemary's Baby', but so much more real than one can fathom, when they say 'sell your soul' they are not being figurative. This has a good plot as is very watchable!!!"

" The most unflinchingly disturbing, darkly-satanic body-horror nightmares of the decade!
",-0.5954,-0.9375,2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"I really appreciated how fatefully screwed-up this fame-lusting actress gets in 'Starry Eyes' - As her misery became ever more acute, mine own eyes did moistly ooze salty spheres of illicit pleasure, thereby despoiling the sublime symmetry of my own swarthy visage, mirroring this foul corruption taking increasingly insidious hold of her ruinous physiognomy, my own profane desires escalated no less invidiously than the vile, satanic pestilence drawing this poor, ungodly wretch ever closer to some unimaginably diabolical doom! 'Starry Eyes' is a gloriously perverse invocation of the Hollywood dream, and arguably one of the most audacious, squirm-inducing, unflinchingly disturbing, darkly-satanic body-horror nightmares of the decade! - 'Be very, very careful what you wish for as the devil just might be listening!'Emotionally grisly stuff indeed!"
" Too Theme Driven for its Own Good
",0.4404,0.86,2021-01-21 00:00:00,6,"Starry Eyes is a fun and titillating little movie. The lead performance is excellent and many of the supporting roles are strong as well. I was pulled into Sarah's world quickly and became almost immediately empathetic to her plight and desperation. She is a good character.Unfortunately the script doesn't choose to develop her so much as radically transform her. The sensible, plot driven first two acts are followed by a third act that is very much a jagged edge on the package. I understand the need for symbolism, themes, and underlying messages in the cinematic arts. And believe me, you'll get the message, it's about as subtle as a baseball bat to the spine.You should watch this movie, it's good as a whole and has moments of greatness. But a lack of cohesion keeps it from being the classic it has the potential to be and that is a direct result of the screenwriter wanting to drive home a point (again, well done, I can't miss it sir) but not properly setting up the pay off.Worth 90 minutes of your life, but don't expect it to blow you away."
" How didn't it get much more recognition?!
",0.0,-0.9968,2020-12-28 00:00:00,8,"Sarah goes to auditions to become an actor in Hollywood while working as a waitress and have a weird boss with cringey rituals at work. She goes to a horror movie audition and when they seemed to reject her, she had a fit at the restroom and the lady wanted her to come back and show them how she went crazy over rejection. She pulled her hair and went crazy in the audition room. Then she thought they made fun of them. She has loser friends such as a wannabe director Danny and his girlfriend Erin being rude about everything about her and her flatmate Tracy. Astraeus a.k.a Starry production company wanter her to come over again to get naked in front of a stong light projected onto her and they flashed the light until she kinda transformed. Then they invited her to a mansion and she met the producer there. The old man wanted to have sex with her and she refused and left the house. She was devastated as she left her job and didn't take the part. At the pool scene which was very impressive, she just left the pool and called back the production company after leaving the pool and her fiends. They called back and she went over to go down on the producer. She returned to the job but after an altercation she slapped her boss and left. She was a mess already drooling and looked like very drunk. She started to rot just like a rotting dead corpse. Her hair was coming off, her nose started to go dark, her lips and her eyes were smoky. She had an altercation with her friends at the skating place. Then the scene at the bathroom where she literally looked like a rotting dead body as her fingernails were coming off and she puked maggots in the bathtub. They finally called her and she left the house to kill her friends. The killings were super brutal. She first killed Erin in the kitchen. She slit her cheek with a knife and stabbed him and then went for the girlfriend of the guy that just went to the bathroom. With a barbell she smashed her face and it was such a bloody scene. Then the guy wanted to escape but he slipped on her piece of scalpel on the floor and she stabbed him in the back. Erin wasn't dead and she suffocated her in a plastic bag. Danny the director were stabbed outside as the men in black showed up. After the ritual at the hill outside she rose from the soil where she was buried with starry eyes and no hair. There was a present by the grave with a happy birthday note. She went back home and killed her flatmate Tracy in her bed by sucking her lips and life. She wear the wig and the dress to become the star that they promised her. She wore the pentagram necklace and it's done."
" What would you do??
",0.0,0.7814,2020-11-25 00:00:00,8,"A story about a young girl who will do whatever it takes to succeed to be a star.I'd never heard of this film before, and only really chose to watch it because it was mentioned on a 'best of Prime Video' list. Normally all I take from these lists is that the film will be at least watchable, especially if I've heard nothing about it prior. However, I was pleasantly surprised at what was in store for me.That's not to say the film is pleasant. It isn't. At all. It's actually a body horror film even if it isn't billed as such. The effects are convincing and the make-up is exceptional. There is also a lot of violence in the second half of the movie and it actually hits home rather hard, as in contrast to the surreal nature of the film itself, it is realistic and brutal.The film is very well written and, without wanting to spoil anything, is a metaphor on what I expect an aspiring actor's life to be like. Something I find interesting about the film is that the protagonist is never forced into any of the horror that unfolds before us. She chooses to do it all. Admittedly she doesn't know exactly what she's getting herself into from the get-go... but isn't this what life is like for all of us?The film isn't perfect. It has a slow start and requires a bit of patience for you to get through the first thirty minutes or so. I also feel that it sets a premise that you kind of want to know more about at the end of the movie. I guess that means that a sequel is a good idea?Overall an enjoyable horror film for those who can handle a bit of violence and body deformation and well worth a watch. Just keep reminding yourself half an hour through that it hasn't really started yet."
" Horror? More like horror-ible
",-0.228,-0.6042,2020-10-30 00:00:00,1,"Hubby and I watched this, and several other horror films, in the days leading up to Halloween. We watched Starry Eyes because it was on a list of must-see horror films. Why or how it ever made such a list is beyond me. The characters were not likeable, the writing was not great, and the ending made no sense. The movie was not that long but it felt like an eternity. On the plus side, the camera work was well-done."

" Entertaining in the Traditional Horror Way

What I mean in the ""traditional horror way"" is that I wanted all the friends to die in this movie because I hated them and they did and I was satisfied. However, it's a fairly forgettable movie, this is my second time watching this movie and I had to watch it again just to remember everything about it (besides that her friends were out right garbage). So, I would suggest this to other people that just want an entertaining, slow burn horror movie."

" Disgusting early on - Awesomely brutal & mind bending in the end.
",-0.8176,-0.3628,2020-08-21 00:00:00,7,"WOW. Better than I assumed. It was disgusting early on, said a lot about the world of acting before it was a headline. With it being a 2014 film vs post 2017 Weinstein. Awesomely brutal & mind bending towards the end.The effects were very well done. Gross & sometime to much for me. Had to turn my head at least one time with it touching on my biggest pet peeve for bodily harm in movies.Alex Essoe (Sarah) absolutely owns this role & stands head & shoulders above everyone else on the screen. Her acting both physically & emotionally were easily the highlights of the film. Amazing to find out she was Wendy Torrence in Doctor Sleep.This is a movie I'll be watching again down the road. I had to give it a 7 out of 10 just because there are so many weak performances & for it being a little longer than it needed to be. These are not big negatives just things I do take into account at the end of the day. Give this one a watch if you feel you're out of go to movies & want to try something new you shouldn't be let down in the end. GETCHA' PULL!"

" Interesting Supernatural Look at Hollywood and Horrors of Being Famous
",-0.25,0.9994,2020-07-03 00:00:00,9,"This was a movie that I missed checking out as it was during an odd time for me. I was no longer working at Family Video and didn't really have my finger on the pulse of new movies that were coming out. When I got into listening to podcasts, this is one that would come up quite a bit so it made my list of films I really needed to check out. This was decided for a new side podcast that I'm doing, Side Quest, as a movie Jake and I would cover so I jumped on the chance to give it a viewing for that. The synopsis is a hopeful young starlet uncovers the ominous origins of the Hollywood elite and enters into a deadly agreement in exchange fro fame and fortune.For this movie, we start with Sarah (Alex Essoe) looking at herself in the mirror. She is in her underwear and is judging herself quite harshly. Sarah is an aspiring actress that works at a local restaurant called Big Taters. It is like a Hooters, but they specialize in selling potato products. Her boss at work is Carl (Pat Healy). He's not happy that she has her phone on her and we see he's kind of sleazy by checking her out.We get to see Sarah getting a call for an audition, but she doesn't do very well. In punishment, she goes into the bathroom and pulls her hair out. She doesn't give up though. At home, she's having her morning coffee and sees a casting call for a role that she fits in a movie called 'The Silver Scream'. She applies for the role.The movie then introduces us to her group of friends. She lives with Tracy (Amanda Fuller) who is a good friend, but does have a bit of an issue with sharing some personal secrets with the rest. She also introduced Sarah to this group. There's Danny (Noah Segan) who is a wannabe director and really wants Sarah to star in his movie. We have Erin (Fabianne Therese) who is kind of rude and makes snide remakes. Her tagalong is Ashley (Natalie Castillo). Sarah isn't handling her anxiety well at the party and Erin doesn't really help that.Sarah goes to leave and gets a phone call. Danny catches up to her, wanting her to read his script. She gets excited when she learns that for what she applied for, they want her to come in to audition. Danny and the rest of the group seem happy for her, but Erin downplays it after hearing the name as well as when later she learns it is from Astreus Pictures.She goes to the audition and sees another aspiring actress leave while crying. Sarah gets called in where she will audition in front of the casting director, Maria Olsen, and her assistant, Marc Senter. Sarah seems to nail it, but they don't see impressed. She goes into the bathroom and has another fit of punishing herself. When she goes to leave the bathroom stall, the casting director is there. She wants her to come back and do this in front of them. Sarah is hesitant at first, but she really wants the part and she gives in. This gets her a callback.Sarah really wants to show everyone that she can do it, so she quits her job when Carl gives her an ultimatum. She also is pushed to her limits of how far she will go, which culminates with the producer, Louis Dezseran. That's officially when she has to decided, give everything up to be rich and famous with this gateway role, or to keep her morals.All I really want to say with that recap over is wow. I can see why podcasts that delves deep into movies like covering this one as there really is a lot here to uncover. What I like about this movie though is how subtle a lot of things that we get here. Clearly Sarah is a starlet that has come to Hollywood for fame. She is like countless other girls who are there to make it big and she thinks she has all of the talent in the world. It is disheartening her that she is going to these auditions and not getting them. It doesn't help when you have a 'friend' like Erin who has much thicker skin. She rubs it in Sarah's face about a commercial that she got over her. Sarah is talented, but we see that she doesn't have the highest confidence.Going along with this confidence aspect, we get an interesting dynamic with her and her 'friends'. Tracy and introduced her roommate to them, so they've all known each other longer. I do think that Danny is a good guy by nature, but it feels he has ulterior motives when it comes to Sarah. He makes her at ease, tells her that he wants her in his movie, but he also has slept with Erin who is ruthless. I do like that they all back her up in not sleeping with the producer. This whole group seems for the most part to have their morals and wanting to do everything the right way, but I'm curious about Erin still.This movie is also pretty subtle in the changes that come over Sarah. For the second interview, she is asked to strip naked in front of the camera and just let go. I did read trivia that this was taken from something that David Lynch had someone do at an audition. Or at least they claimed he did. We get the first glimpses that Sarah is losing herself and has to decide, do I want to give in to what is being offered or do it the 'right' way. She really has a moral decision when it comes to meeting the producer.I love this cult aspect of this movie as well. This shouldn't come as a spoiler if you've seen the poster for this movie. She has stars carved into her eyes and I mean, when most people head to Hollywood, they are star eyed. On top of that, the fictional company is Astreus, which is the Greek god of stars. She has to decide to give herself over to being a star. It also feels eerily similar to old Hollywood or what Harvey Weinstein was doing. It is fitting that Astreus is an older film company that has been done, but making a comeback. Actresses needing to sleep with the higher-ups was more prevalent back in the older days, which is fitting the movie is auditioning for is The Silver Scream.What I want to take this next though would be to the acting, which I think it is great across the board. Essoe just owns this role. I know many people talk about this being her best and I've seen her in a few different things. What makes it even better was I read trivia that she was trying to be an actress for years before landing this role. It feels like she's bringing a lot to this performance. The rest of the acting crew of Fuller, Segan, Therese, Coffy, Castillo and Nick Simmons all feel like group of friends. There's a bit of pretentiousness there, as they're independent and want to make art, where it is really that they just haven't gotten their break. It makes for an interesting dynamic with Sarah. I liked seeing Healy in his supporting role. I also thought that Olsen, Senter, Dezseran and the rest of the cult rounded this out for what was needed.Something else I've been excited to talk about with this movie is the effects. They seemed to go practical which I loved. The blood we get in the movie looked so real and the attacks at the climax did as well. There is a scene with Sarah and throwing up bugs, which I was shocked to find out she really had them in her mouth. That is dedication that makes this even better. I don't even mind the dream sequences and how they help develop the story. Plus it is a movie that you don't know what is real or what she is experiencing. The cinematography is also on point in my opinion.The last thing I want to cover would be the soundtrack. I found that at first they were going to go for a more classical score, but they were convinced to go with a more synth and I'm so glad that they did. It works very well in ramping up the tension for me to feel things that Sarah is going through. It is legit one that I want to seek out for when I'm writing if I'm going to be perfectly honest.Now with that said, I thought this movie did some amazing things if I'm going to be perfectly honest. I like the allegory that we are getting of selling your soul for fame and giving over to it. It is a perfect look at Hollywood with some of the horror stories that you here. The acting is on point. The effects and the soundtrack are as well. I never got bored with what this movie is doing and I'm madder at myself for taking this long to finally get around to seeing it. After this initial viewing, I think that I'm going to say this is a really good movie that is bordering on great. I would highly recommend this movie if this sounds good."
" Odd
",-0.3182,-0.1469,2020-06-18 00:00:00,5,"Now this starts as a very good drama, great cast and very well acted. But if you are looking for horror, the only violence's /horror is in the last 10 minutes. ( and is full on ) At that point the film has flipped on its head, as far as plot, and turned into a more possession story."
" slow building towwards a gory mess
",-0.3612,-0.9491,2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,"Much is said about Starry Eyes and now that I have seen it I do understand all the fuss about it. It's slow building, that is for sure. Once you are over an hour in this flick things go awry and the real horror comes in.And the real horror is gory, messy and if you aren't into those flicks it will be offensive for some. The sory itself is all about a girl not really accepted by her so-called friends. And she's out to find an acting career. Failing she is willing to give her body litterly to a new job been offered. Giving a blow job to the producer is were things really goes wrong.So the last half hour it's all about blood, vomiting, stabbing and smashing. Again, not for the easily offended. Once the flick is over you will ask yourself a few things about her. Nevertheless, acting of main role far above mediocre. After all, an ode to the heydays of horror, the score alone proves itGore 2/5

" A good little movie with great effects, but the story isn't so strong.
",-0.3026,-0.9236,2020-04-01 00:00:00,7,"As time goes on I may lower my rating from a 7 to a 6. My point is that if you plan to watch it, don't expect a great story or anything. The movie's still good though. The lead actress gives a great performance - everyone in this movie is pretty good. What it gets wrong is a riveting story. What it gets right is great acting, great special effects, and an overall polished quality to it. It kind of reminds me of It Follows (2014), which came out the same year.The plot of this movie is essentially that a waitress at a sleazy restaurant wants to be an actress. She goes to an audition, and because she has a fairly disturbing quirk (she tears out her hair when she's frustrated and stressed out), she gets a second audition. At the second audition, she's made to strip nude. She's uncomfortable at first but does it anyway. She is told that she needs to let herself be free (or something to that effect). She goes for a third audition, where ultimately, she has to sleep with the old producer. She refuses. Then she goes home, some stuff happens, she takes a pill (which perhaps lowers her inhibitions, but that's not really clear), and then she goes back and performs sexual acts with the producer.After this, which is probably over halfway through the movie, she starts to decay. Her flesh rots, her hair falls out, and she vomits up maggots. It's all very disturbing, and very well done. She calls the agency for help but they just give cryptic responses about sacrifice. She then murders all of her friends except for her roommate. She's reborn in an almost comical cult ritual, where she comes out of the dirt completely bald and with bright green eyes, like something out of a sci-fi movie. She goes home and kisses her terrified roommate, spilling blood and whatever sickness into her. I'm not quite sure if her roommate is dead or is now just going to suffer the same fate as the protagonist.So all this happens and it's all well executed. The murders are very violent and I had to look away (I'm not a huge violence fan). The makeup on the main character is excellent, as is her acting. But I expected more. Perhaps some sort of message or arc of some kind. But in the end it's a fairly shallow story that's very well told. It's enjoyable and I'd recommend it, but don't expect it to leave a long lasting impression."
" Unforchantly It Didn't Deliver as Dark Satirical
",0.0,0.5913,2020-03-29 00:00:00,5,"The biggest weakness of Starry Eyes is the tone and direction because for the majority of the movie is represents it self as dram about a up incoming actress.
But scene by scene the movie goes in multiple directions without focusing on a one way, it shifts from being drama to dark drama to a dark comedy to horror comedy so fast and that's on the screenwriters/directors.
The only one thing that is consistent and very good is the performance from Alex Essoe who gives a star-making performance."
" This one really took me by surprise but be warned!
",-0.3382,-0.9327,2020-03-03 00:00:00,8,"'starry Eyes' despite a weakish title, really delivers as both a truly disturbing horror movie and a stark morality tale. Warning:- contains some very strong scenes but handled extremely well and intrinsic to the plot. Shades of Dario Argento (especially with the musical score) and David Cronenberg, when he was at his most bonkers! Just mentioning those two masters of horror, should be enough of a recommendation but beware, very little has come close to the graphic depictions of demonic possession. The same production company as 'House of the Devil' and 'The Innkeepers', which with this, are three of my top horror choices (certainly in the recent years). Unusually has two Director credits but proves that two minds are better than one. Had a horrific nightmare, after watching this late at night."

That's the central story in this 2014 film that I've always believed is way more true than fiction.It's directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, who went on to create the remade Pet Sematary.Sarah works at Big Taters in between auditions and dealing with her unsupportive friends, like Erin (Fabianne Therese, John Dies At the End) who steals roles from her, her roommate Tracy and director Danny (Noah Segan, who has worked with Rian Johnson on many projects).After another failed try-out for Astraeus Pictures' new movie The Silver Scream, Sarah goes to the bathroom and begins tearing her hair out, which actually inspires the casting director. The follow-up, where she is encouraged to strip and transform herself in front of a strobe light, was inspired by a story someone told Widmyer and Kölsch auditioning for David Lynch. She goes into a trance state and experiences extreme euphoria, but refuses to sleep with the producer at the third audition.At a pool party celebrating Danny's next movie - Sarah was promised the lead - our protagonist is surprised to see him kissing Erin, who is going after her part again. She returns to the producer's house and goes down on him, which begins to change into something new. That change into something new involves throwing up maggots and having her nails and hair fall out, but beauty is never pretty.Sarah is told she must either embrace the new her or die. She accepts it, kills all of her friends and is reborn a star.This movie is pretty great, made in a world where modern horror feels soulless. It has a 70's feel without devoting itself to that decade or coming off as a period film."

" Interesting premise but the second half lets it down
",0.2144,-0.4723,2019-11-02 00:00:00,6,"Starry Eyes follows young waitress and aspiring actress, Sarah (Alex Essoe) as she desperately tries to conquer the acting industry and rise to Hollywood stardom. When Sarah auditions for the leading role in an upcoming horror movie, she's pushed to her limit and is forced to decide how far she's willing to go to achieve her goals. I personally found the premise and the plot to be interesting. Particularly in the midst of Harvey Weinstein and the MeToo Movement, Starry Eyes is very relevant and explores the harsh and cruel realities of the acting industry in an emotive and hard-hitting way.From the beginning, Starry Eyes is a very atmospheric film that builds up the suspense and mystery a great deal, particularly in the first half. However, this film is not for the faint hearted and is far from being a run-of-the-mill thriller. This is a true horror; it pushes the boundaries of human endurance and there's gore aplenty. In fact, there are scenes that even I (a avid horror fan, with more tolerance for gore than your average viewer) struggled to watch.The first half of the film is definitlley the strongest. Time is taken to develop the protagonist (something that is a rarity across the horror genre), which enabled me to connect with her and become invested in her well-being. We witness the mundaneness of Sarah's life and her fragile psyche, all of which made her very sympathetic. This investment I had in the protagonist, meant that I was intruiged by her story and the lengths she would be willing to go to in order to land a leading role in an upcoming horror movie. As a result, there was an element of mystery and unpredictability - you know something bad is going to happen but you don't exactly know when or what.Unfortunately, the second half is a complete let down which takes all of the intrigue, suspense and plot from the first half and casts it aside for some mediocre, predictable and boring murder spree which is completely disconnected from the rest of the story. I find it hard to understand why so much time is spent developing the plot and ramping up the suspense only for it to be discarded. It feels like there's a complete disconnect from the first and second halves which is unfortunate, because the film had a lot of promise and up until that point I was really enjoying it.Nonetheless, Starry Eyes is still deserving of a slightly above average 6-star rating for the simple fact that I enjoyed the theme, plot development (in the first half) and acting. Despite the disappointing ending, there were a lot of redeemable aspects of it and if the second half had continued on the same trajectory and explored the dark psychological aspect of the plot rather than turn it into an unimaginative gore-fest this could have easily got an 8 or even 9 star rating from me."
" Worth checking out
",0.2263,0.5456,2019-10-19 00:00:00,6,"First off, I did enjoy this movie. Every actor in really sells their role, especially Alex Essoe. A less talented actor would not have made this film nearly as harrowing as it was. Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer are great at ramping up the tension when it matters most, and certainly gave me the creeps more than a couple of times. When the violence comes, it's shocking and disturbing.That said, the film's pacing felt off. The slow burn mostly works, but the pivotal scene felt like it could have come 15-20 minutes earlier and been more effective. The supernatural elements could also have been toned down or even eliminated altogether and it would have been no less of a horrifying film. And the shot of the scar of the producer's hand was just a bit silly.""Starry Eyes"" is totally worth watching once via streaming/rental, especially for horror fans, but it's not anything I would add to my permanent collection."
" Interesting take on the Faustian mythos
",0.4019,0.9957,2019-10-18 00:00:00,7,"As usual, short & sweet with no spoilers.I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. From the description, it read like a Robert Johnson tale set in modern Hollywood. In other words, the Faustian mythos, but with a bit of a twist.While not perfect in any universe, all technical aspects of this movie range from above average to very good or excellent. The directing is well done, with some unusual shots and interactions between characters. Similarly, the cinematography is, for the most part, on par with the directing. The acting is average to decent by most, but I felt the lead actress did an excellent job. Her portrayal of the journey away from innocence, down the Faustian path, is very believable. A lesser actor would have made the movie drag, not to mention having ""less teeth."" Thankfully, she carried it well, especially during the last 1/3 or the film.The first 2/3 of the film is largely context. While watching, it felt at times as if it was dragging, and while there may be scenes that are a bit ambiguous upon initial watch, they certainly fit in to the context of the greater story. The final 1/3 of the film is definitely where the meat of the film lies.The fx are very well done. All scenes are done using practical fx, which is always a personal preference over CGI, and the designers did a very good job with this aspect. As a gorehound, I appreciate solid, realistic fx that don't cross the line from reality in to digital fakery. I appreciated this aspect of the movie very much.Re: parental notes:
there is a fair amount of profanity throughout the film. A majority of the characters are millennial age and ""creative types,"" so cursing is second nature. It is not profuse or overdone, but is present.drugs and alcohol pop up in a few places throughout the movie. Nothing overly pervasive, but they're there.there are a couple of intense scenes and/or scary images. The intensity lies not so much in actual on-screen horror but within the context of the specific scenes. Nonetheless, the film is certainly not for young kids.sexual situations and nudity are relatively mild. There is some implied sexuality in multiple scenes as well as some brief female nudity toward the end.violence and gore is relatively mild until the last 1/3. The climax of the film has some bloody scenes with mild gore in accompaniment. As a gorehound I would have appreciated more but the scenes were well done and did the story justice.A solid movie all around, especially as a retelling or the Faustian mythos."

Very low budget is obvious but not constricted in the movie in anyway. I have seen other reviews compare to the work of Argento and Polanski and see there point. Seems to be always mentioned as quite gory. It is. But it is not repeatedly and is very shocking when seen. Or unseen!. The elements of body horror I found, as the title of review says, very disturbing and unsettling.
The plot is scarce really as nothing is totally explained which for me made it even more frightening and I think this was the purpose of the filmmakers.
I have given it 8/10. I found it perplexing and mysteriosly suspenseful. Alexandra Essoe is the centrepiece of the movie and she is quite brilliant in this.I hope my review is not giving potential reviewers too much or too little information for them not to watch. I hope I have given an overview which will tempt people same minded to me of a genre I sometimes watch.I wont say you will enjoy it. I didn't. One bit. Disturbing and unsettling. Hence the 8/10.One point I must say is there is some flashing images. I have epilepsy which is not just photosensitively caused. This caused me to struggle to watch some scenes. It probably should be warned before the movie. It may well be and I didn't notice. And I have no intention of watching it again to confirm it is. It disturbed me so much that if I checked I may be drawn in to watch it all again and the thought of enduring it again frightens me. Hence the 8/10! Brilliant piece of work."

She also feels ""Big Taters"" is beneath her and literally tears her hair out to get a break in a movie.It's a horror movie and she recklessly quits her day job.

Sarah's predicament speaks to all those who have been trapped on the casting couch.The film could have pursued that theme; horrific enough in its own right, but instead Sarah seems to have a breakdown over her shattered dreams. She deteriorates before our eyes and we can't be sure whether it's imagined or something demonic.Then she settles accounts with the flatmates until she's literally slipping in their blood. Hitchcock may have actually been envious of the lack of restraint permissible these days in scenes of carnage without the censor looking over his shoulder.

" you'd be better off selling your soul for a donut
",0.4404,-0.9867,2018-02-25 00:00:00,3,"This movie began well enough, with a compelling protagonist and story along with a pair of delightfully odd casting agents for the studio that will bring about all the oncoming plot turmoil.
but after indulging us in an intriguing concept and setup, the movie starts to languor about with essentially nothing but vaguely creepy moments, scenes, and synthesizer music.
The protagonist, Sarah, has an ordinary audition which leaves the casting agents rather unimpressed. As a result, she goes to the bathroom and has a nervous fit that turns into a hair-pulling freakout. As it happens, one of the casting agents was in the bathroom after her and was intrigued by her freakout, and so wants her to come back to do it again for them.She does, and they like it, but she thinks they were mocking her, until she gets a callback for another audition.
The audition is a lot more incoherent and eerie than the first, yet it works and she eventually gets to meet the producer, who starts Harvey Weinsteining her and she bolts out of the room. But the producer's words linger in her mind as she goes to get her waitress job back and contemplates mediocrity again.
So she ends up returning to the producer and getting the starring role in the movie they make.
Then... a whole lot of nothing happens. A whole lot of nothing, followed by some inexplicable ""body rot-horror"" reminiscent of ""Contracted"", followed by a needlessly gorey sequence in which she somehow decides that killing her friends is what is needed to get ahead in the role she has already landed.
Basically, a whole lot of nothing occurs between her returning to the Producer, and the end. There's no real conflict further on, there's nothing even related to the movie or the movie studio that occurs. Aside from her body inexplicably rotting and becoming maggoty, everything that occurs after that point is entirely of her own violent and malicious doing.
Once we do get to the end, it takes on a vaguely satanic vibe, before then just ending. It's difficult to even properly process or explain much of the movie because so much of the film is just essentially ""there"" without any meaningful connection to the main plot.
It legitimately feels as though the film ran overly long, and in their zeal to cut it down for time, they ended up cutting out a huge portion of the middle section."

So I've been watching prepared for the worst. However, this movie is neither excellent nor particularly innovative, looking like an inspiration over Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"". The film ends up being a huge satire around the highly brutal and competitive environment of the American film industry. The script is based on the ambition and lack of scruples of a young aspiring film star, who is willing to do anything to reach success, managing to get an invitation to audition in a large studio. The sarcastic criticism is present in the way her dreams are chewed and ruined, and in the way the film producer abuses her, forcing her to do things she doesn't want. She ends up selling her own soul... well, probably Hollywood should be a soulless environment also.The cast is led by Alexandra Essoe, a young actress with some talent and who has done a fairly regular job here. Amanda Fuller was good enough also, with a good supporting work. Maria Olsen was well, sinister enough, but her task was only to add some gloomy atmosphere to the film. The rest of the cast did an average performance, doing what was necessary but without adding much more than that.The film uses some scenes in which the actress appears half-naked, but I don't think this was bad, or a call to the ""sex sells"" formula. I think it went well the way it was used. It has some gore also, but it's not too heavy, helping to reinforce the tension.Not being a brilliant movie, ""Starry Eyes"" delivers what it promises. It's a film that is within acceptable standards, can create a pleasant tension but doesn't frighten or make us feel afraid.

The film's best asset is the 80s style synthesizer music score, which provides ample eeriness at key points. The other big highlight is Alex Essoe as the waif-like protagonist who undergoes some massive progressions throughout as she truly transforms, just like one of the casting agents say that she has to early on. On that note, it is the early scenes here that work best, most notably, the cold and uncomfortable initial two auditions with some elongated silences. Die-hard horror fans though might prefer the latter stages of the film since they are the wildest and goriest. They also make the least amount of sense, however, with the film never really exploring the details of the pact she makes to get the leading role, nor the cult that she gets embroiled with, an occasional visible pentagram aside. And yet, the film still essentially works even with such plot details left murky and ill-explained. This might not be the subtlest of films about being ruthless in order to get ahead in life, but it is certainly one of the most atmospheric and offbeat, leaving several images that are hard to shake from the mind."

The main character is a waitress who aspires to become a model, so when she visits a new agency, you can guess the kind of thing that happens.Truth be told, I'm no big fan of this genre and STARRY EYES reminds me why. This is drawn-out and cheap, with unpleasant characters throughout and a lead you can hardly get behind due to her self-destructive drive.

She plays an obsessive actress that will do whatever she needs to succeed (or in this case, just get a part). All of that of course leads to the downward spiral. Reading reviews using ""disturbing"" and grotesque"" are a stretch, since the gore, nor psychological attack is not either, but it does seem to be a ""hit home"" thing that I would bet L.A. sees a lot in struggling talent.

",0.0767,-0.9927,2017-05-31 00:00:00,1,"I'm very angry that almost 2 hours were wasted on this amateur movie, so this why am writing this review, it made me feel bad and angry.if it wasn't promoted as horror movie, then probably I wouldn't be disappointed and might be less frustrated, after 1 hour I hoped that maybe there will be sort of surprise from some kind of ""creative"" creators our there but, nothing changed, it remained boring as from the first minute.The last 10-20 minutes there was few bloody scenes (the main actress killed her friends), but based on that, you can't say it's a horror movie, because there was ZERO suspense.there was no interesting plot, no surprises , nothing mysterious that you the viewer could see and try to figure out until it's revealed , there is no such a stuff, but instead a monotonic character, desperate that hope to get a role for some kind of commercial or a movie, I even didn't care what that was due to the fact of many non-sense and crap that was there.to summarise the movie: A desperate young lady is ready to suck for getting role (and she did) , while portraying the interviewers and the producer as evil and belong to satanism groups (they wore pentagram symbolic accessories) , probably a metaphor to make them look evil and the ""protagonist"" as a victim, while this didn't happen , I couldn't sympathise the protagonist, so I'm not sure if producers wanted to do that by purpose or it's a mistake in the story. my overall impression was, that this movie was done by frustrated producers that are jealous from Hollywood's top successful producers so they made this film with lots of clichés and overacted/over-presented metaphors, that probably don't exist today or rare.So, yeah, this movie managed to make me feel like idiot that I continued watching it after 1 hour, or even after 30 minutes."
" What's with all the good reviews?
",0.4404,-0.5002,2017-05-25 00:00:00,2,"Comparing it to Rosemary's Baby??? Not even close! Rosemary's Baby had a plot, a REASON, an EXPLANATION, it made SENSE! This movie makes no sense. I'm only giving it 2 stars since it kept me watching until the end, hoping to make some sense out of it.At the beginning it seemed pretty good. Seemed like it was leading up to something interesting. But then it dragged on and on. Here's the spoiler: NOTHING HAPPENS. Other than the gory murders at the end. And some stupid cult yelling ""Hail Astreaus!"" (The subtitles misspelled the Greek God I think it was). Sort of like the slightly corny ""Hail Satan!"" at the end of Rosemary's Baby. Except in Rosemary's Baby they slowly let you learn about the cult, the people in it, what they were doing, what their origins were, and then let it all hang out in the end. Here, nothing. Just leads up to the end with a cult with no explanation, no background, nothing.If you like to see people's face get smashed into pulp with a dumbbell you can skip to close to the end. It's completely pointless. I don't mind seeing gore like that - I'd rather not - but if it has a point and a plot and makes sense then I don't mind.One little technical point. It's not that easy to stab someone to death. Especially a small girl stabbing a medium-size man. Normally they would fight back, not just sit there going ""why?"".One thing I will say is the lead actress Alex Essoe did an AMAZING job of acting, wow! She was a great actress, even acting being an actor. She was great. Too bad the rest of the movie was worthless."
" Eyes Wide Shut Meets Contracted
",0.0,0.3802,2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"I was intrigued the entire movie because I didn't know where it was going to go. I've done some reading about the Hollywood/Illuminati/eyes wide shut conspiracy theories and was curious how this film would depict the occult in Hollywood. The film did a good job portraying the sinister side, however it was a snap shot of the creepy behind the scenes devil worshippers and more of a character study as we watch Sarah transform. It was interesting to see LA filmed this way, very unglamorous and almost always overcast. This set an ominous tone throughout. Ever her friends, aspiring actors and film makers, living out of vans or piled into small apartments constantly drinking and hanging out. It was a rosy vision of life in La La Land. Overall a Slow burn, worth the watch, and some solid gore as well!"
