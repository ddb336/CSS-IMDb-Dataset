" No no no
",-0.6808,0.6114,2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,There is no need for this movie! Understand it is a movie of short stories but At least make them long enough to actually care what is going on.
" Too Obsessed with Shock
",-0.5106,-0.908,2021-03-22 00:00:00,4,"The production company that produced ""Tales of Halloween"" dared invoke a comparison to ""Trick 'r Treat"" in their product description, a now-legendary anthology of Halloween-centric horror stories. Which is unfortunate, because Tales of Halloween is nowhere near as clever or as thoughtful as Trick 'r Treat was.A lot of that can be attributed to Tales of Halloween's shotgun-blast approach to an anthology. Quantity is the name of this game, packing in a good ten stories in to a 90 minute run time. As such, Tales of Halloween starts to feel more like a playlist of Youtube videos rather than any real anthology of finely-crafted stories.Having so many also means the bar of quality isn't always super high. More than a few of these stories are clumsy, or stupidly crass, or just weirdly mean spirited. Though Tales of Halloween generally follows the horror structure of ""bad people get what's coming to them"" there's not a lot of runway to launch real narratives, so a lot of stories open with garbage people being rude for no reason and then almost immediately getting slaughtered by a ghost or whatever.There are a couple stories that are legitimately good, granted. But most of those seem to understand they don't have a lot of time to work with and focus more on simple folktale sort of stuff, where the characters themselves don't really matter. But it's still very, very simple stuff.The most complex narrative twist is generally just an extremely boilerplate ""that's what happens!"" followed by a lot of screaming and blood. Gore hounds will probably get something out of that, but I was left wanting more.The bad stories are never short enough, and the good stories just aren't long enough."
" Entertaining, but nothing outstanding.
",-0.5236,0.9719,2021-03-08 00:00:00,6,"Like many horror anthologies, this is a mixed bag. Thankfully the majority of these are pretty good, with only a couple being underwhelming.The gore effects were pretty decent and there were some great character designs. The acting (for the most part) was also a lot better than I expected.I enjoyed my time with this one, and you will too if you don't go in with the highest of hopes."
" A rather shallow Halloween anthology
",0.0,0.7003,2021-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Another low budget cult-style Halloween movie, this one an anthology of around ten short tales. It's not on par with the much better TRICK 'R TREAT, which has real depth; by comparison, many of these stories are too short and merely there to offer cheesy gore at the climax rather than anything approaching proper scares or atmosphere. What it has going for it is a by now familiar '80s throwback feel, with lots of fun cameos from Joe Dante, John Landis and Adrienne Barbeau reprising her role from THE FOG, and plenty of special effects. It is a bit shallow and a bit cheap though, be warned."
" Chill out, this movie is fun
",0.5106,0.8774,2020-11-27 00:00:00,7,"Downfalls aside (I won't reiterate here), I think this is a fun flick! Until I started recognizing actors, I thought this was an older deal, because of the""excessive"" gore and types of violence. How nice this movie packs that in; conservative sensors of America be damned. Overall, great holiday fun for the whole family!"
" Would have been better if they focused on best tales
",0.8658,-0.9859,2020-10-31 00:00:00,6,"Usually I would rate a movie at Tales of Halloween's quality as a 4 or 5. However, the movie does a great job of developing its Halloween theme and has replay value around Halloween. For that reason, I upgraded Tales of Halloween to a 6 out of 10. The movie makes some beginner mistakes, such as the lack of an interesting inter-connecting tale. Additionally, anthologies usually do not have ten tales because it is not the best idea. Tales of Halloween would have been a much better movie, more like a 7 or 8 out of 10, if it had focused on its five best tales and further developing these tales. Here is a tale by tale breakdown:Tale 1: Sweet Tooth. Very interesting and festive tale of a Halloween spirit. One of the best tales, in my top three.Tale 2: The Night Billy Raised Hell. This tale had promise, but didn't quite deliver. The montage of Trick r Treating shenanigans leave a lot to be desired, and even for such a short tale there are quite a few plot holes.Tale 3: Trick. An intriguing tale that makes you wonder why the Trick r Treaters are attacking. A tale the movie should have made longer to make the kills more suspenseful and to fully develop the backstory. One of the top five tales.Tale 4:The Weak and the Wicked. One of the weaker tales, as the short nature of these tales prevents fully caring about the desire for revenge. Also, it's also connected to Halloween through the night being on Halloween. Movie should have cut this tale.Tale 5: Grim Grinning Ghost. An interesting tale of a Halloween ghost, movie should have spent more time on this tale. Also features a guest appearance by Lin Shaye. One of the top five three tales.Tale 6: Ding Dong. A quixotic Hansel and Gretel tale, a bit too weird and undeveloped to be enjoyable. Movie should have cut this tale.Tale 7: This Means War. Probably the weakest of the tales, as it's just two guys fighting over Halloween decorations with no real plot. Movie most definitely should have cut this tale.Tale 8: Friday the 31st. This tale had promise, but plot was too light on substance to make it interesting. The special effects of the possessed woman are especially poor. Movie should have cut this tale.Tale 9: The Ransom of Rusty Rex. An interesting tale of kidnapping gone wrong on Halloween. They could have made it scarier, but still festive and interesting nonetheless. One of the top five tales.Tale 10: Bad Seed. Made by none other than The Descent's Neil Marshall, an interesting tale of an evil pumpkin that would have benefited from a longer run time and more climatic final fight. One of the top three tales.All in all, a decent movie where the best tales have replay value. 6/10"
" A mixed bag
",0.0,-0.2023,2020-10-28 00:00:00,6,10+ Halloween tales provide a welcome variety but a connecting theme is solely missed.
" Not to be taken too seriously.
",-0.1779,0.6087,2020-10-23 00:00:00,5,"It's not a bad movie, in the tradition of horror movies told in segments. For those of you that love the hard hitting, serious horror movies, this is one to pass by, as it's quite whimsical and light, horror for young teens.Some of the segments are poor, some are ok, the last two are perhaps the best of all. The acting varies from poor to decent, and the special effects, they are as you'd expect from a low budget horror.You will see the odd dead body twitching, but who cares, it's a fun watch for Old Hallow's Eve. 5/10."
" Feeble Tales
",-0.296,0.8782,2020-10-23 00:00:00,2,"This is one feeble, flaccid piece of ho-hummery. I was hoping for something creepy and unsettling, but these stories start exactly as they mean to go on, with no surprises, no attempt at atmosphere, just a lot of camp. Basically, each story starts, does the set up, then plays out exactly as you'd expect it to. So, in ""Sweet Tooth"" and ""Grim Grinning Ghost"", a ghost story is related by characters and...yep, they come true. ""The Ransom of Rusty Rex"" replays O. Henry's classic short story, ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" to little effect (whoever thought that a man chasing a diminutive demon round a warehouse could be so boring?). To be fair, ""Trick"" brings a nice, disturbing twist, and in ""Ding Dong"" Pollyanna McIntosh is a stand-out in an otherwise bland cast, looking as if she's having an immense amount of fun and being genuinely disturbing -- or as close as anything in this film gets. There are puzzling cameos (how did such talent? Did any of them read the script? Could none of them help?) and self-aggrandising references (ie, a riff on Carpenter's ""Halloween"" theme every time a pumpkin is shown) but this film is too camp to land a blow anywhere: it's not funny and it's not remotely scary."
" I put off watching this for years because...
",0.0,0.9218,2020-10-19 00:00:00,6,I didn't think I would like it. I was wrong. Not the greatest movie but far from the worst. If you're a horror fan there is a lot of cameos that make it fun. And the stories are all pretty short so the movie goes pretty fast. Had some pretty cool make up effects too. A fun watch around Halloween.
" Meh
",-0.0772,0.824,2020-10-17 00:00:00,4,Someone watched Trick R treat and decided to do something similar with a fraction of the talent. Jokes never land and scares are never scary. It's a nice poster though...
" So bad it's almost good
",-0.2928,-0.7922,2020-10-16 00:00:00,3,"The movie is watchable because it's very campy and the stupidity makes it funny. The actors are amateurish which is just as well considering the ridiculous stories. There is some fluctuation in the writing and directing as each short was done by different people.
If course the most notable name in the picture is prolific composer Lalo Schifrin who does the score for the movie-it was his last.Tales of Halloween is extremely poor quality but it's so bad it's almost good in a strange way."
" Halloween treat
",0.4019,0.8611,2020-10-13 00:00:00,8,Why are people so serious about everything? This is a great movie. It's entertaining and fun.
" Boring
",-0.3182,0.2598,2020-10-11 00:00:00,1,Did not keep me entertained only one story out of all the mini stories I actually enjoyed I do not need to watch this again
" No. Just no.
",-0.5267,0.8554,2020-09-16 00:00:00,1,"I like a good, strange movie occasionally, but this one made little sense most of the time.I won't comment on the acting or effects, there are enough reviews that I have seen regarding those. And as a fan of the classic Universal monster, old Vincent Prince, Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello monster movies, I knkw that seldom does acting or effects determine my enjoyment of a spooky-season movie. Cohesive storytelling on the other hand, that is important. I can forgive a multitude of sins if the story makes sense.Tales of Halloween is described as ""the best horror anthology since Trick'r Treat"". But where Trick'r Treat's connectivity was integrated into each story, (characters appearing in the background, Sam being present, past events influencing more than one story), this rancid pile of pumpkin gut's connections are tenuous at best. The only real connection is the radio DJ narrative and a couple times you do catch a glimpse of characters from other stories. Few of the stories make any sort of sense if any at all, and those that do have the potential to make decent spooky story, Trick and Grim Grinning Ghost for example, are so short they might as well have been left out altogether.When you go back and read the blurb, these are supposed to be some of the top directors in horror. One would think, that an anthology created by top directors in a genre, would be more cohesive and fleshed out, but it feels more like they each just phoned it in.If anything, this mess mocks Halloween in general, and not in a fun satirical way. It's more like a school yard bully vs the nerdy, Halloween-loving kid.I would have preferred a return of Sam with new tales or even a return of The Crypt-keeper from the 90s.For my Halloween entertainment I'll stick to Trick'r Treat and Tales from the Crypt."
" I didn't get it
",0.0,-0.9645,2020-09-06 00:00:00,2,"I don't know if there was a certain genre it was going for, but it was a terrible movie. The acting was bad, the story lines were horrible, and this was far from a horror movie."
" Only watch the first half
",0.0,-0.9821,2020-08-25 00:00:00,3,"I don't know if they ran out of money or ideas or both but by the second half of this movie, the stories went from okay to terrible, the effects went from okay to really bad and the acting went from bad to worse.
These types of films are usually hit and miss but this just went from bad to worse and it became a chore watch it until , I was willing it to finish quicker.
Just about three stars.."
" Fun
",0.5106,0.8979,2020-04-20 00:00:00,5,"Decent anthology. Some fun stories with a couple duds, but stays pretty fun throughout."
" Super pumpkins; what more do you need?!
",0.636,0.9932,2020-04-11 00:00:00,6,"This was a fun, interesting movie to watch that's for sure! Some of the segments were a bit ridiculous, but it wasn't totally awful. The ridiculousness is what made it so fun I think. Not much in terms of scares or anything, but there was a decent amount of gore with some of them. I've seen worse and I've seen much better anthologies. This one fits right in the middle of that.I've seen reviews saying it's better than Trick 'r Treat, but there's no comparing the two. This one didn't come close to it in my opinion. Big reason for that is Tales of Halloween tried to fit 10 segments into a 90 minute movie making the stories seem rushed. It doesn't leave much room for a really good quality storyline or any character development. That's the only real big downfall of this one.Still, nothing about it was boring in any way and the variety of stories kept it interesting the more you went on with it. Sure there's the typical stories of demons and ghosts, but then you've also got aliens and human-eating super pumpkins. This is top quality stuff!!There was good quality in the acting, but also had a ton of not very well known actors. They all seemed pretty decent though.All in all it was a very entertaining one, but not one I was overly impressed with."
" Mediocre
",0.0,0.7906,2020-04-07 00:00:00,5,"In this episode movie of about 1 and a half hour, there are 10 short films presented by the wonderful Adrienne Barbeau. She acts as a radio DJ and introduces the bunch of shorties eloquently. After watching them, I have to say that the quality of the stories ranges from awful to ok. One of them even was funny. Over the whole playtime stereotypes of Halloween went by and I often thought by myself, that these minutes are spent and never come back. It's good to watch it for a few movies which were innovative. I would recommend to watch it on a rainy Halloween. It's ok to watch, but don't except too much."
" Not as good as advertised
",-0.3412,0.3276,2020-04-05 00:00:00,6,"I clicked on this because I like some short story films, especially scary ones. None of these is great however, and some of them are terrible. The effects are hit or miss but mainly none of these are very good, in fact I was bored enough at one point to start scrolling on my phone."

" Comedy but so gruesome
",0.1901,0.9348,2019-11-11 00:00:00,8,"This was surprisingly good, think of Trick'r'Treat but even more gory, some great slapstick moments and my fav scene has to be the cute little alien bit, reminded me of Peter Jackson's Brain Dead. Another good section was the one with the kids who want revenge, such a good twist."
" Don't believe the low ratings cuz this movie ROCKS from start to finish
",0.2057,0.2672,2019-10-31 00:00:00,9,If you didn't like this film then maybe it's not your genre..... it's loads of fun.... And I thought the acting and creativity with each story was OUTSTANDING.... Give it a watch!!
" Zero stars should be an option
",0.0,0.2263,2019-10-31 00:00:00,1,I have no idea how anyone could give this a halfway decent review. This is the Sharknado of horror anthologies. There is better acting in movies. I only watched because it was compared to Trick r Treat. That comparison is almost as asinine as comparing Howard the Duck to Scarface.I guess it could be funny if you smoked a bunch of weed and just laughed your off at how bad everything is done. There's its one star.
" Best Anthology Film Since V/H/S/2
",0.6369,0.9894,2019-10-18 00:00:00,8,"I love anthology films and I love movies set during Halloween so I pretty much loved this before I even watched it. However, anthology films have let me down pretty much 9 times out of 10 but I always keep coming back for more.Tales of Halloween is consistently stylish and entertaining. Each of the segments are tight and filled with the creative Halloween spirit. I had a goofy grin on my face the entire time and wish that I could afford the blu-ray box set. Crack some beers, order some pizza and call over a few friends for a guaranteed good time."
" Not scary, just enjoyable.
",0.0572,0.946,2019-10-14 00:00:00,8,"This anthology takes a lighter, humorous take on halloween. Sure, some stories have a creepy antagonist, but the humor in each made them worth watching. My favorite was Friday the 31st because of the little alien who was dropped of by his parents to trick or treat. Give it a try. It will at least make you chuckle."
" Hit and miss.
",-0.1531,-0.831,2019-10-11 00:00:00,5,"About half the stories were good and a couple of those were quite disturbing. There were a couple I didn't even understand and the rest were just bad. Of course the one Dana Gould was in was terrible just like everything he has ever done. It was also quite annoying that they just list all the titles at the very beginning, very amateurish."

It all works pretty well, too.""Tales of Halloween"" has some really good shorts, ranging anywhere from parodies of Friday the 13th to Pumpkins that eat humans (which is my favorite segment, I think).I was surprised at all of the creativity in this very obviously low-budget flick. Give it a watch, if you're a fan of this kind of thing."
" Ten segments - some good, some not so good.
",0.7003,0.097,2019-05-07 00:00:00,5,"Ten interwoven stories about Grimm Halloween happenings. Some of the shorts were interesting and scary and well filmed. Some were not so great, ridiculous beyond humorous."
" Disappointing that Barbara was brief
",-0.4939,0.3165,2018-11-13 00:00:00,6,"Tales of Halloween is an anthology movie and I only saw it because it had Barbara Crampton in it.
In the end she appeared very briefly in the segment Grim Grinning Ghost.
Incidentally her Fraternity Vacation co-star Kathleen Kinmont had also been in a movie with Halloween in the title that of Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers.
Notwithstanding it was disappointing that Barbara's bit in Tales of Halloween was very brief and hardly noticeable, this film presents quite a bizarre set of tales.
Quite terrifying in a lot of places and including how each of these tales end.
Adrienne Barbeau presents these tales as the DJ and she was pretty good at it.
Quite an enjoyable anthology movie and it fits in well with its theme of Halloween and the payoff that it delivered at the end.Matthew See

" The true horror is the acting
",-0.2263,0.8695,2018-11-08 00:00:00,5,"Fun but forgettable anthology of halloween stories. Ranging from good to very average. Nice ideas, but much of the acting is truly dreadful. I much prefer 'Trick R Treat'."
" Meh
",-0.0772,0.8377,2018-10-11 00:00:00,4,"I mean it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't good. No twists or turns or wondering who lives and who dies. Everything ends exactly how you'd think it would. The second story kinda has a twist, but barely. That one was the best story of them all and it was still kinda meh. I liked the concept of the individual horror stories and would watch something with a similar setup again, but it just lacked creativity."
" Fun for Halloween

" so so but not even comparable to Trick r Treat or any Tales from the Crypt
",0.5023,0.9878,2018-09-27 00:00:00,5,"This was a great idea for Halloween but I wish the segments were better quality and more creative. The best is Sweet Tooth only because he is just really creepy but most stories fall flat especially Friday the 31st. I know it was supposed to be silly, but it was too silly...a cartoon alien? You could even see the rope holding the girl possessed by the alien when she smashes through the barn...just careless. The Ransom of Rusty Rex is good and so is The Grim Grinning Ghost. The narration is great and certainly helps the movie along, but the next one will require much more effort. Also a neighborhood in LA is where most of these are shot and it's just not creepy at all. Maybe head over to the North East the next time around?"
" Nice one

" Anthology of Cheese
",0.0,-0.5881,2018-08-05 00:00:00,2,"Gore and comedy are bundled together in this lame horror movie that tells of 10 different tales, most of them groaners except for maybe 2. Wasn't worth the 1:37:00 to watch the 15 minutes of what I did like, I was expected to be scared or at least entertained. I was neither."
" Delightfully Weird and Quirky
",0.4588,0.9479,2018-07-31 00:00:00,7,"Tales of Halloween is low budget and it is very aware of that which just gives the film charm. This film consists of 10 fast paced horror stories that are all messed up and weird in their own way. The first story had me thinking ""What the heck?"" for one hour straight, but I would rather not spoil it and leave it to you to watch. This film is filled with gore and blood gushes everywhere throughout each story. Every single story in this film is well written and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire 1 hr 30 minutes this film lasts. The music in the movie was actually really good and a pleasant surprise and the visuals while being mediocre are expected for such a low budget film and considering that I won't be too harsh on this flick. This film is also very similar to the Tales From The Crypt series which really made me want to watch the film in the first place because I personally adore that series. The stories were all short paced and kept the movie going at a constant pace never leaving a single dull moment. This is a MUST WATCH for horror fans."
" A problematic but still thrilling anthology
",0.4939,-0.9987,2017-11-16 00:00:00,8,"Halloween-themed segments set in one suburban town.The Good Stories: Sweet Tooth-Marveling over his haul, a kid trying to eat his treats learns the story of a boy not getting his candy and has become a demon every Halloween. While his guardians play with the haul, they realize their stories might be true. This was a decent enough segment. This really works the Sweet Tooth character, which is a believable small-town backstory that's somewhat fun and given a lengthy time to play-out. The eventual retribution is carried out and delivers some thrills and solid gore- gags, but it suffers from a familiar set-up and expected conclusion.The Weak and the Wicked-Living in a desolate neighborhood, delinquents tormenting trick-or-treaters finds a loner attempting to stand up to their tactics. Turning to him, they realize too late who've they come across and must deal with their actions. This one ended up being quite surprising. This has quite a stellar backstory that's played out a grand theme of revenge is quite a stellar twist. That this has the kind of up-tempo and frantic action present here makes for a really exciting time here, and there's a lot to like.Ding Dong-Following a deadly Halloween freakout, a man resents going through a trick-or-treat game with his wife. When he realizes that it's starting again, he tries to stop her deadly plans from coming true. This was a somewhat offbeat, mixed-bag affair. The scenes of her going through the different antics with the children are quite fun, while the witch effects here are incredibly gruesome. The main thing holding it down is a severe lack of information on what's going on, making the entire affair confusing overall.This Means War-When neighbors move across the street, a man's attempts to have the scariest haunted house on the block are severely compromised by their more modern display. Growing frustrated by their lack of respect, their challenge reaches a boiling point. This ends up as the most frustrating effort due to the lack of resolution as this one just tends to end. Still, their antics to one-up each other give this a nice amount of fun.Friday the 31st-Running for her life, a woman tries to escape from the serial killer who has stalked and killed her friends. Despite her best efforts, she can't escape from the madman who soon finds a more otherworldly threat in his presence. This was just an absolute blast of a segment and was the highlight of it all. The fact that it plays with slasher clichés and conventions through the woods and the shack battle before it becomes a wild, deranged inversion in the second half with the killer now forced to battle an equal as the two take turns brutally dismembering each other makes for a truly gruesome and wickedly funny segment.The Ransom of Rusty Rex-Attempting to kidnap a millionaire's kid, two thugs hold him for ransom and follow through on their plans. When it all blows up, they realize they have a more troublesome charge than they expected. This was a rather enjoyable effort which has a lot to like. The twist to the origin of the kid makes this a solid effort, and the different tactics to get rid of his resulting in a fun time overall. Again, not much is known about what's going on but it's still enjoyable.Bad Seed-Following the death of her husband, a woman's claims that a pumpkin came to life and eat him is scoffed at by the police. When more stories turn up, the investigating officer finds something far deadlier than she expected. This was a fun and enjoyable one. The meta-thread of mentioning the other events in the town give this a fun feel, and the attacks by the creature are incredibly fun with the thing walking around leading to some grisly antics. The ending doesn't pack a punch, but it's still enjoyable.The Bad Stories: The Night Billy Raised Hell-Heading out trick-or- treating, a young kid initially told to prank an elderly man is forced to go along with a series of tricks. As the games continue, he soon learns the shocking reason for his plans. This was quite a lame and barely worthwhile segment. The main joy here is seeing how far he goes with his pranks, and while there's a certain glee to be had it's about all that goes right. The main problem is that none of the pranks are funny or have a point to them, the pointed celebrity cameo is just plain pathetic and there's such a stupid twist at the end that it really spoils the entire segment with barely any horror resolution.Trick-Hosting a Halloween party, a group of friends find their festivities interrupted when one of the neighboring trick-or- treaters attacks them. As they succumb to more attacks, they soon learn the otherworldly reason for their behavior. This ended up being a mixed affair. There's a lot to like here with the efficient manner they go about slaughtering the group and it manages quite a few scenes of brutal action here. The problem is that none of it is particularly scary as the lack of motivation for anything manages to make the entire affair confusing and it just seems banal overall.Grim Grinning Ghost-Gathered for Halloween, a group of adults learn a terrifying legend involving a local ghost. When one woman confronts the sinister creature, she finds her night to be more terrifying than she expected. This was a rather troubling and overall bland effort. Most of this is that barely anything happens as the vast majority of the running time is her walking home which is effectively eerie and somewhat chilling. Still, the lack of action here doesn't really give this one any suspense and it just makes for a dull enough offering leaving this one of the weaker stories.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language and children-in-jeopardy."

This had potential, but could've been better and only had a couple decent stories. Also, it seems like there's more silly than scary moments. Adrienne Barbeau (The Fog), Barry Bostwick (The Rocky Horror Picture Show), Lin Shaye (Insidious), Felissa Rose (Sleepaway Camp), Robert Rusler (A Nightmare on Elm Street 2), John Landis (An American Werewolf in London) and Joe Dante (The Howling) make appearances. I'd view this at least once only if you're into Halloween or horror."

" Tales of Terror
",-0.5267,0.7628,2017-10-27 00:00:00,6,"Consisting of ten Halloween themed stories, this horror anthology movie has often been compared to Michael Dougherty's 'Trick 'r Treat' with all incidents occurring in various areas of the same town. Everything is, however, nowhere near as interconnected here, lacking the acute blending and constantly overlapping characters that made 'Trick 'r Treat' so dynamic. There is nary a boring moment to be had though as each segment in 'Tales of Halloween' is appropriately brief. Some episodes are inevitably more effective than others though. Lucky McKee's ""Ding Dong"" is a clear highlight with a bizarre comedic streak and several WTF moments involving an unhappy childless couple. The Jason Voorhees spoof ""Friday the 31st"" is pretty innovative too with some 80s style stop animation in the mix. The vast majority of segments have predictable punchlines though, with ""Grim Grinning Ghost"" and ""Sweet Tooth"" falling particularly flat. Overall, however, 'Tales of Halloween' is no less uneven than most horror anthologies out there and while some chapters sag, the majority work with some really fun cameos from the likes of Joe Dante and John Landis."
" A surprisingly good Horror Anthology
",0.1027,0.9764,2017-10-22 00:00:00,8,"Expecting a generic Horror Anthology film, which are usually gory, cheesy, and uninspiring, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. While a couple of it's segments were duds, most of them were great. They had a nice mix of being either funny, spooky, invigorating, and even in one case having a great twist that I did not see coming whatsoever. Most of them have great characters and plenty of awesome moments and scenarios. I think I liked Friday the 31 or the Ransom of Rusty Rex the most, yet Bad Seed and The Night Rusty Raised Hell were also really good. Of the ten, I think I only disliked two; Ding Dong, which was too weird and depressing, and Grim Grinning Ghost, which seemed to barely last and had no satisfying ending. Of all these stories though, they all have great sets and are very well produced. This anthology film is definitely worth checking out, especially around Halloween.You can read this and other reviews on my blog at https://ajourneywithjake.wordpress.com/"
" This movie sucks
",-0.3612,-0.4404,2017-10-19 00:00:00,2,"The only spoiler in this review is that this movie sucks. I wish I had that spoiler before I wasted my night on it. It's basically some douche watched Trick R Treat and thought, ""Hey, that doesn't look too hard,"" and then made a ***crud*** movie. Trick R Treat is an 8. This is a 2 at best. I wouldn't ever stoop to padding my comment to reach the minimum length, but this trashpile is lucky I've wasted 6 lines and 48 seconds even mentioning it. Ugh."
" A surprisingly entertaining Halloween anthology...
",0.6249,0.997,2017-08-29 00:00:00,7,"Now, I will say that anthologies is usually something that I am not overly keen on because they are mostly too shallow and you hardly get invested in the segments as they tend to be too short in time. However, I must admit to being more than pleasantly surprised with the outcome of ""Tales of Halloween"".This anthology is comprised of ten stories spanning 1 hour and 32 minutes in total, which makes for a small amount of time per segment, for sure. But what works in this anthology is that the segments are precise and to the point; there is no trotting about and wasting time. But better yet, the fact that each of the stories is connected with another stories in the anthology just makes it all the more enjoyable and watchable.Most of the stories were quite good, and there definitely was a good variety of stories here, so there is something for just about everyone in the audience, whatever your preferences and tastes may be.What really impressed me in ""Tales of Halloween"" was the amount of familiar actors and actresses that they had popping up in all of the segments. It was an actual joy of sitting and recognizing familiar faces and trying to spot them. The cast includes names such as Barry Bostwick, Lin Shaye, Barbara Crampton, Stuart Gordon, James Duval, John Savage, Lombardo Boyar and more. So there definitely was a bunch of talents to be seen here.""Tales of Halloween"" is listed as a horror comedy, which is exactly what it is. Sure, there were spooks and creepy stuff to be had here, but nothing in the likes of being too much for it to still be a family spook fest. And the combination of horror elements and comedy worked out quite nicely.The special effects and practical effects in the anthology was quite good. The effects were believable and really served their purposes quite well. This was good, because effects are quite important to anything related to the horror genre.Of course, some segments were better than others, but in overall, then this was a very enjoyable anthology. And it definitely turned out to be a rather great surprise. I sat down to watch it with my family, and everyone had a good time. So ""Tales of Halloween"" is a well-worthy addition to any movie marathon that you might host during Halloween.If you haven't already seen ""Tales of Halloween"", then I can highly recommend that you take the time to do so, because this really was quite a blast."
" Not Worth Watching, Mostly
",-0.1695,-0.991,2017-08-27 00:00:00,4,"This is my first time reviewing a movie on this site. I disliked this film so much, I feel the need to warn others to stay away. As a disclaimer: I am a fan of classic horror films, as well as more modern horror films and bad b-movie type of movies. There is nothing charming about this set of short films. They are not scary, they are not funny. They are not creative or even very interesting. Despite there being 10 short films to watch, only a handful of times did I find myself actually engaged with the characters and story lines. Here is a run down of events as best I can remember them (keeping in mind I watched this movie just 3 hours ago.) Sweet Tooth - Two uninteresting teens tell a slasher ghost story to a little boy. The story (for the first time ever, apparently, despite this story being a ""rite of passage"" and town legend) comes true. Characters make bad choices, and the viewer is left more confused than entertained. The Night Billy Raised Hell - A neighbor plays a prank of Halloween night. This segment was meant to be funny, but all of the sound effects and horny devils came across as more cringe inducing and bizarre than actually hilarious. Also there is a strange and inexplicable cameo from America's Next Top Model Adrien Curry.Trick - Seemingly chill adults are terrorized on Halloween Night. This one left me yelling at my television set as adults try to hide in very small corners and fall drunkenly into pools. I feel this would have been better done if the attackers were the main characters. Again, I was left more confused overall because even though I could see what the director was trying to say, it wasn't done effectively. The Weak and The Wicked - Western styled. Arsonists. Cool costume design. One of the more engaging films of the series, but still eye-roll inducing. Grim Grinning Ghost - After hearing a ghost story, a woman is afraid to travel home alone at night. I appreciated this one. Things were set up nicely, and almost every set up had a pay off. Solid premise, if more classic story telling. Ding Dong - This one was ... interesting. A woman wants to have a baby. Oh boy, does she REALLY want to have a baby. The husband grapples with his wife's desires. Ovens are involved. And silly blonde wigs. The overall premise was enjoyable and I liked the costume work and creepy imagery. Unfortunately again, this one was a muddled attempt that ultimately felt under-done. Maybe if given more time overall (and less screen time devoted to flashes of red face paint) it could have been stronger. This Means War - I liked this one. Simple premise, reliable narrative, engaging ending. Friday The 31st - This segment made me and my watching partner very, very angry. While the other short films had so far been mostly boring, confusing or underwhelming, this one was so stupid it made my blood boil. No logic here. Just cheap callbacks to beloved horror movies like The Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc. poorly done and thrown together for kicks. This was a joke between friends that was taken too far and allowed onto the screen. The Ransom Of Rusty Rex - Plot twists and kidnappings. Enjoyable, amusing, somewhat gross. One of the better segments, well acted compared to other bits. Bad Seed - Ugh. Spare me! By this point I was just waiting for the movie to be over. I'd come too far to really stop now. The effects were cool, and the premise was a strong one, but I was emotionally drained and stupefied by and hour and a half of horrible Halloween ""fun"".I would highly suggest saving your money and your sanity and choosing to watch literally ANY other film this Halloween. Seriously. Anything else."
" Star Studded Horror Flick!!!
",-0.6784,0.9844,2017-08-04 00:00:00,10,"An epic anthology horror flick with ten spooktacular tales of frights and fun from eleven visionary directors, Lucky McKee, Darren Lynn Bousman, Adam Gierasch, Neil Marshall, Mike Mendez, Dave Parker, Axelle Carolyn, Andrew Kasch, John Skipp, Paul Solet and Ryan Schifrin. Not only has this movie got great directors, but it also has an all star powerful cast feat - Caroline Williams, Robert Rusler, Adrienne Barbeau, Barry Bostwick, Lin Shaye, Pollyanna McIntosh, Marc Senter, James Duval, Nick Principe, Alex Essoe, Tiffany Shepis-Tretta, Noah Segan, Barbara Crampton, Stuart Gordon, John Landis, Felissa Rose, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Kristina Klebe, Cerina Vincent, John Savage and many more. The soundtrack also features Sean Spillane who is known for 2011's The Woman soundtrack. I watched it twice in cinemas and Hell, I even pre-ordered the special collector's edition when I wasn't earning very well, because that's how much I love this movie. An extremely excellent horror anthology which is truly one of my favorites!!! This Bluray/DVD Boxset comes with a CD soundtrack and a Special Features DVD disc, with dozens of bonus materials with interviews, and short films featuring Kane Hodder, Malcolm McDowell, Michael Bailey Smith and more. I feel like a million bucks having this boxset in my collection, and it's definitely a must own if you're a collector of films!!!"
" Entertaining for the most part
",0.4404,0.9825,2017-03-18 00:00:00,9,"I bloody love anthologies! While they can be a mixed bag in which some are bloody awesome and some pretty damn terrible, the fact that each doesn't last long makes it worthy a watch in my eyes!The Tales of Halloween has ten gruesome tales all based around Halloween, of course (the most wonderful time of the year!)Most of them are fast-paced and involve classic Halloween staples, full of references to infamous horror, but a few were too horror- comedy for me. I prefer creeps over laughs, but there was enough gore to keep me satisfied. A perfect watch for Halloween, though I'd have loved it if Tales of Halloween had gone all out scary, dark and disturbing, but i'm sure many horror fans will love this anyways. I'd recommend giving it a go, there's surely something you'll like."
