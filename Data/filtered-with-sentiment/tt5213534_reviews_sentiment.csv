" No Wonder They Never Made It In America.
",-0.296,0.6542,2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,"Oasis was never close to being as big in America as they were in England and this documentary makes it easy to see why. Separated from their boorish media image and regional/cultural significance in the UK, and judged purely on their music, they amount to nothing more than a mediocre guitar band with a handful of catchy tunes (less than that really, just four). It's laughable that they swagger about as if they invented bad boy attitude while playing really some of the most tepid, middle-of-the-road rock music ever produced coupled with anodyne lyrics that strain for meaning but fall most often between risible surrealism and empty pretensions to importance. America picked up on many great UK bands from the Beatles and Stones through Elton and Bowie and Led Zeppelin, even Def Leppard, Culture Club and George Michael had a modicum of appealing talent, and we've spotted the ones that were nothing underneath from Cliff Richard to Robbie Williams to Kylie Minogue (yeah, I know, she's Australian, but the Brits are the ones who made her a superstar over there) and gave them a deserved ticket back to Mother England. You can add the painfully unimpressive, exceedingly middling Oasis to the bunch."
" Makes it all look so easy
",0.5777,0.3961,2021-03-17 00:00:00,10,"Form a band. Do some gigs. Take over the world. It all looks so easy. But as Liam says, it was their Spirit or attitude That set them apart from everyone else. They were angry and they were honest. They cane to conquer and conquer they did. You can feel that anger And honesty on that first record."
" The Not-So Supersonic Picture
",0.0,0.9952,2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,"A documentary giving us access to behind the scenes clips and capturing life inside one of the world's biggest rock band. 'Oasis' formed in Manchester in 1991, Liam on lead vocals and Noel, who joined late as a fifth member, was mainly the songwriter. Throughout the watch we see 5 'lads' evolve into global megastars and travelling all around the world. The band members were never permanent and in fact changed many times, with only Noel and Liam making the full 18 years in the band. Paul McGuigan played bass and Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs was on keyboard, both original members of Oasis but both left the band in 1999, supposedly because they couldn't keep up with the lifestyle. McGuigan or Guigsy as he was known as left during the 'What's the story, Morning Glory?' tour in 1995 with ""nervous exhaustion"" and Arthurs followed. Scott McLeod replaced Guigsy on bass but suddenly quit weeks after joining. Andy Bell was Oasis' final man on bass and carried on until 2009. Bonehead was replaced by Colin 'gem' Archer who persisted for 10 years with Bell. The band lived very fast-paced lifestyle whilst on tour and in the music business all together, the fame was new to them. Noel and Liam spoke openly about using drugs when on tour, Noel even stated that it was as normal as ""drinking a cup of tea"". But, this lifestyle started to affect the band and their performances, the night before a gig in LA the band took magic mushrooms, causing them to hallucinate mid-performance, and the band were allegedly dreadful that night; not to mention the drugs use being so often that it resulted in two band members leaving with exhaustion and struggling to keep up. Tony McCarroll played the drums from 1991 to 1995, he was replaced by Alan 'Whitey' White who remained a member up for 9 years, within the, years he sustained many thumb injuries whilst playing and was replaced by his older brother Steve and when Alan left in 2004, Steve was tipped as his potential replacement. Instead, Zak Starkly joined the group, despite never being credited a member of the band, he stayed until 2008 - one year before the band split. Chris Sharrock was the drummer between years 2008 to 2009 until the disbandment. Sharrock joined with Liam, Archer and Bell as a part of Beady eye. More band members came and went, including the names: Mike Rowe and Zeben Jameson both on keyboard - Matt Deighton spent less than a year when he fell out with Liam and Noel, he was the lead guitarist at the time - Jay Darlington who took the place of Jameson in 2002 and stayed until the disbandment. Present in the documentary is Liam and Noel's mother Peggy Gallagher who was born in Mayo, Ireland; she focuses on her pride for her two sons who did what they enjoyed and were successful. Their father (Tommy Gallagher) is vaguely mentioned, a man who seemingly disregarded his family. After a gig Liam had to be held back after seeing his father in a pub, Tommy was claimed to be abusive towards his children and both Noel and Liam don't take to him to this day. As the tape advanced, the success grew, Oasis constantly number one and performing on top of the pops, selling out arena's all around the globe. We found out hidden truths that Liam was mentally peculiar and whilst on stage, sometimes half way through a song, would walk off - leaving Noel to take on lead vocals. Their albums were huge, most notably in 1994, their best selling album 'Definitely Maybe' featuring 'Rock 'n' Roll Star' and 'Supersonic', sold 15 million copies worldwide. 'What's the story Morning Glory?' In 1995 was the bands second most successful album with songs such as 'Don't look back in anger' and 'Wonderwall', third was 'Be here now' released in 1997. Oasis' final album was 'Dig out your soul' released in 2008, a year before the band split up. Oasis invented lyrics recognised by everyone, thief first ever number one was 'Some might say' but their best selling hit was I'm 1995 with 'Wonderwall', a love letter that Noel wrote to his girlfriend, selling 1.34 million copies. In order of hits, second was 'Don't look back in anger' an iconic tune released in 1996, evolved from Noel singing and strumming, thinking of song ideas, and Liam asked who Sally was, thinking he was singing ""so Sally can wait"", the lyrics stayed and the track sold 948,000 copies. 'D'You know what I mean' was released in 1997 and was the 5th best selling single that year, selling 745,000 copies. Fourth best is 'Whatever' in 1994, the anthemic and uplifting song sold a total of 553, 000 copies. Finally, selling a total of 520,000 copies was 'Roll with it', dropped in 1995 the song lit fire in the Blur vs Oasis rivalry. Blur released 'Country house' in the same week and beat Oasis to number 1, selling 50,000 more copies their rival's single. Songs worth mentioning of course include: Champagne Supernova, Live Forever, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, and the title of the documentary, 'Supersonic'. A well created watch saw the good and bad of being a rockstar. Focusing on the Gallagher brothers, their love for Manchester City, their Mother and for what they did as a job. The passion for music."

" Oasis energy
",0.2732,0.9674,2020-07-01 00:00:00,10,"Wow. As a mega fan in the 90s, and still following them despite my taste in music changing over the years, I will always come back to Oasis. These guys radiate energy from their core and the people just soak it up and exude it back to the band. This took me back to all their shows, Liam's stances, the crowd, jumping as a whole in unison, to. every. single. song. that could be jumped to. Love the archival footage. The audio clips of last ten minutes had me tearing up. After the internet, live music has never been like this. No one could touch Oasis. The last truly great mega-band. If you saw them live in the 90s, that is an experience that will go unmatched. This doc captured their energy perfectly."
" I had forgotten Liam was a cunt
",-0.6249,0.8513,2020-06-13 00:00:00,6,Great tunes and memories. I enjoyed learning about Oasis rise to fame but it did remind me why I eventually lost my love for them and that was Liam. This man-child was an actual fud. Swaggering about acting hard when you know he couldn't fight to save himself. Noel was the only band member that I thought had actual talent. His lyrics are the only reason I will occasionally listen to some of their classics.
" Oasis: Supersonic
",0.0,0.9695,2019-07-21 00:00:00,7,"Oasis are one of the most famous Britush bands of the nineties and noughties, they have made a number of fantastic and catchy songs, I read a little about this documentary about them, I was most interested to find out more about them, directed by Mat Whitecross (Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll, Take That: ""The Flood"", Coldplay: ""Paradise"", Red Nose Day Actually). Basically, this film examines the popularity of Oasis, their contribution to Britpop, recording their three Number One albums (Definitely Maybe, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, and Be Here Now), and the ""Madchester"" scene, and the fiery relationship between musician brothers and lead singer-songwriters Noel and Liam Gallagher. Specifically, it focuses on the forming of the Manchester-based rock band, their early performances, their rise to fame, the ups and downs during their formative years, and the height of their success in the 1990s. The film is made up of archive footage, including home video, television performances and recorded concerts, promotional interviews, and backstage footage, including unseen material. The individual members and crew that created the band, and those associated with them, speak in off-screen interviews during this material. Many of their most popular songs of the 90s also play in the background, including ""Supersonic"", ""Live Forever"", ""Cigarettes & Alcohol"", ""Whatever"", ""Some Might Say"", ""Morning Glory"", ""Rock 'N' Roll Star"", ""Don't Look Back in Anger"", and ""Champagne Supernova"". With off-screen interviews from Noel Gallagher, Liam Gallagher, Peggy Gallagher (Noel and Liam's mother), Paul Gallagher (Noel and Liam's brother), Paul ""Bonehead"" Arthurs, Maggie Mouzakitis - Tour Manager, Jason ""Roadie"" Rhodes and many more. It is an interesting approach, to have a film simply show the footage, and not the people talking speaking onscreen, it is very well edited, and it really does show how the band become era-defining superstars. It is a shame that it doesn't truly explore why the band broke up, or the later relationship between the Gallagher brothers, they are naturally constantly swearing in their talks, but also unusually frank, and there is plenty of material that attracts your attention, a most satisfactory musical documentary. Very good!"
" Roll With It
",0.0,0.9317,2019-01-09 00:00:00,7,"I was once on a training course at a swanky hotel in the late 1990s. During the break I went to a quiet spot to make some phone calls.All of a sudden with an exaggerated swagger and some attitude, Liam Gallagher enters the hotel. I was thinking that was a bit pointless, I am the only person here. What was the display in aid of?I could understand how the Oasis boys would always get into fights. They reached the top and they were the cock of the north.Well I did happen to be an Oasis fan back in the 90s. I bought their albums and even their singles as they would come with bonus songs not on their albums.Their first two albums were great. Noel Gallagher who wrote the songs acknowledged in this documentary that after the release of (What's the Story) Morning Glory? the band had reached its creative peak. Some of their songs were recorded in just one day at the recording studio.Supersonic is a warts and all documentary on Oasis. Sibling rivalry, band sackings, the pressure of fame, the rise of Britpop. It all culminated in the band playing several nights in Knebworth to record breaking crowds.Both Liam and Noel acknowledge they were no angels. Drinking, drugs, smoking, swearing, fighting. It all happened a bit too fast. Maybe a little bit of maturity would had meant their creative peak would had lasted longer.A good documentary about the band from their beginnings. Their initial appearances on television, hitting it big internationally and then the band almost self destructing at various points."
" Rock and roll stars
",0.0,0.8369,2019-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Popular musicians can pass from obscurity to worldwide fame in a very short period of time; and that's the focus of 'Oasis: Supersonic', a documentary which charts the rapid rise of the Gallagher brothers' band. It's a not uninteresting story: the group sprung from humble origins, its two leading figures were both combative in nature (especially with each other), but the basic narrative here is the story of sudden, overwhelming fame. There's a merciful absence of outside talking heads, which means we are spared solemn pontification abot their musical significance, but also there's no discussion of the general 'Britpop' phenomenon of which Oasis were just one part. But Noel and Liam are sufficiently frank that it doesn't feel like an airbrushed history either; we do get a sense of what it was actually like to be part of Oasis at this time. As with any music documentary, the music itself is part of it: personally I liked Oasis's their retro rock-and-roll sound even if it wasn't outstandingly innovative, so I enjoyed the soundtrack. The film ends with musing that, in the modern digital age, a similar story couldn't happen now. In general, I'm sceptical about theories about the end of history; even so, twenty-plus years since Oasis played Knebworth, it's hard to think of a band since that has, however briefly, seemed so totally to capture the national mood."
" Head and shoulders above the rest.
",0.0,-0.6295,2019-01-01 00:00:00,8,"This is what a movie/documentary about a band is supposed to be. It makes no difference if you like or know the music it tells a very engaging story. It's the story of a bunch of white working class guys who were unemployed and ended up being the biggest band the UK has produced before everything fell apart.
Central to the fairy tale is the relationship of the two Gallagher brothers who form the backbone of the band. While obviously close the are prone to bust ups which are well known to the public. The roots of this antagonism between the brothers seems to stem from their relationship with their abusive father who played them off against each other. He did this by picking one son as a favourite and the other he abused physically. A surefire way to breed resentment. A fact which neither brother seems aware of all they feel is the hate towards each other which they are unable to explain. If you are reading this guys, dont let your dad ruin your relationship! This is a warts and all documentary which simply works with or without the music. It's in stark contrast to the queen biopic which is a poorly executed white wash of a movie which is saved by good musical segments. While this documentary has musical scenes they are meaningful and don't detract from the narrative. And for once we have a band who know that being in a band is about having a good time so there's no complaints about any hardships. They knew what it was all about. This is one of the better documentaries about the last time music had a huge cultural impact on UK culture. It won't be repeated."
" Fantastic, Well made.

" Don't need to be an Oasis fan
",0.3182,0.9488,2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Supersonic. I was never a massive Oasis fan - couldn't really understand the hype. But this documentary film - from the makers of Senna and Amy - was a brilliant portrayal of the rise and rise of the band in their early years. Looking back their music was very good, even if Liam and Noel were total arses. A thoroughly entertaining 8 out of ten. Well worth a watch even if you don't like their music..... Might even give Eight Days a Week a try now (even though personally I find them over-rated........)"

seen them live in a few countries and as a live band average to poor
but on the albums average to good
but lets faceit they are the poor mans bootleg beatles not original,slightly tacky and incredibably embarassing.the doco was good but made it even more obvious these people have very limited talent and really should just be throwing tyres around for a living.
this documentary is good to have on in the background while you do other things as the people involved and the whole story is not very interesting"
" This is how a documentary should be
",0.0,0.9799,2018-01-19 00:00:00,10,"It has a lot of unseen footage and audios with great anecdotes, it's beautify edited, is very long but very entertained, I enjoyed it very much.
I found in this documentary many anecdotes and stories I didn't know about the band, told by their own voices, it was a lot of fun.
If you were an Oasis fan when they were big this will take you back automatically to those wonderful years, and it would make you realize just how big they were and how much they changed music. They are the last rock and roll stars."
" Truly fascinating documentary
",0.7506,0.9844,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I have never been a big fan of Oasis, considering them to be a simple rehash of old musical ideas spiced up with a heavy dose of Manchester attitude, but I found this film to be utterly compelling. It was shown on TV in the UK at 10pm when I was ready to retire to bed but my wife and I ended up glued to it and watched the whole thing.I played in a Manchester band in the early 90s and I thought I knew everything I needed to know about Oasis but this film revealed a new perspective. Rather than the snarling, foul-mouthed oaf he is depicted as in the UK media (and by his brother) we see Liam as a far more three-dimensional character, projecting glimmers of genuine charisma and talent alongside the sweary outbursts. It's a PR job of course, but a very good one nonetheless.And that's where the only real problem with this film lies; it is an advert for brand Oasis and it is very kind to them. The film sees us through to the peak of their fame with the massive sold-out shows at Knebworth, but we don't get any insight into the wasted opportunities and rapid decline which followed. As impressive as the band's rise was, the story arc doesn't feel complete.I would recommend this film to anyone interested in rock music though, even if they don't particularly like Oasis. In fact, if you don't know their story already that probably just makes it all the more interesting."
" The pre internet British version of Nirvana.
",0.0,0.9853,2018-01-01 00:00:00,7,"In retrospect. The internet ruined many things and technology ruined many. One of the things was authentic rock music. As you can see what it is 2018. It's absolute severe crap. Nirvana ( which was a excellent innovative band ) was around much longer in the beginning and then died because of Kurt Cobain and now we have the success of the drummer called Foo Fighters which continued to be successful for over 20 years but why ( I think they're lousy ) ? Yes Oasis for two albums and three years made a album or two and then boom was extremely successful practically from the day of formation, they were lucky the time was right. The difference is I didn't really like Oasis. And what happened to them from 1997 to 2007. Did they continue their popular success or did Brit Pop turn into The Spice Girls and pansy Brit pop boy bands and then the internet ruining everything slowly in the process. Was Oasis any good after Knebworth. Probably not cause they didn't mention it. So ok it was a three year ego trip with two LP's. Beatles ? not even close by infinity .
However I did watch this entire documentary. Reminded me about those times when I was in my 20's and their hits are good but how was 1997 to 2007 did the hits fade did the popularity fade. It had to by that point they were hit with competition all around them. And I'm sure their music didn't change much just rehashing .... Again in retrospect."
" Absorbing, in depth biography of Britain's most recent great rock band
",0.6573,-0.5484,2017-05-03 00:00:00,9,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Noel Gallagher was the guitar-man for the Inspiral Carpets in the early 90's before being sacked for being too wild and unpredictable. However, later on in that decade, the Britpop phenomenon exploded onto the scene, and him, his brother Liam and two others jumped on the bandwagon, and formed the swaggering, rough round the edges rock group that went on to become the legendary Oasis. These rough round the edges Mancunian boys were uncompromising in their ways, and presented an alternative to the cookie cut vision of what a music personality should be, but managed to secure a series of consecutive hits before conflicting personalities, inter-band dynamics and the advent of ready made pop culture sought to bring them down.While they were undoubtedly tied up in the Britpop bubble of the time, years later it's undeniable that Oasis, as an individual group, generated something within the musical youth of the time that none of the others did, and to many they still do to this day. They tapped into the collective consciousness of young music fans of the time, and fed off a sense of disillusionment and rebelliousness many of them felt in what turned out to be the dying days of fifteen years of Tory rule. Although they clearly modelled themselves after, and idolised The Beatles, they were still raw and authentic in a way a band like Blur or Supergrass couldn't say they were, and in terms of delivering a cocky, take us or leave us attitude, they were in a league of their own.The film charts their story from before they were even born, with their mothers arrival from Ireland in the early 60's, and her marriage to their father, who physically abused her and Noel, but not Liam, although it still left traumatic scars on him, as we learn in one part where their tour manager in the US recounts him 'demanding' her to come down and see him so he could ask if she believed in God, only to tell her exactly why he didn't. Noel, however, seemingly refused to let it define him and managed to be a bit more grounded. However, their rough upbringing still reflected on their style as musicians, with Noel stating that Oasis 'weren't a band for wimps' and that their first reaction through losing a drummer to illness (but not death) was 'f**k me, we need a new drummer.' It all wraps up with Noel's thoughts on what happened after their mighty gig as Knebworth and how 'reality TV/talent show culture/the internet' meant such a mighty event could never happen again, and how the band should have just gone their separate ways forever after that. There's certainly a lot to cover in such a relatively short musical lifetime, and this film soaks you up in pretty much of it and leaves you feeling only minimally deflated after nearly two hours. ****"
" Great!
",0.6588,0.9925,2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"It's not easy to write a review on this documentary as it is absolutely awesome, but lacks something. Perhaps there isn't enough old footage available from band-birth.Oasis is a great band and their road to success marvelous and funny. The documentary is great but could have been broader, deeper and more detailed.For those not used to British accents, do download subtitles! You'll need them.Just hearing these 'lads' speak will make you laugh. I was wondering how such simpletons could drum up such deep and creative lyrics.Oasis is proof that one doesn't need to be a good singer, but have stage-presence, a f-all attitude and (possibly) a very very f'ed up character to become famous."
" Documents A Latter-Day Beatle Mania Like Popularity With Warts
",0.6808,0.9877,2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"Oasis is probably the post-Beatles band that captured a piece of that band's impressive rise thirty years on. It was a long time since The Fab Four had done it, and to see an impressive degree of that mania in a latter-day setting was, perhaps, unbelievable in that it was generally accepted it would never happen again. Though history will downplay it today for a run of almost five years it was like the craziness of 1964 all over again. Only this time not just the era was different. The band itself was like a battlefield sewn with landmines. The Beatles, mostly, made peace offerings among themselves allowing more greatness to spawn even as they, wisely, quit touring. So what caused Oasis to truncate their massive popularity? Supersonic gives that insight. Unlike The Beatles, whose settled on democracy worked, with Oasis something explosive was always brewing. It began and ended with Noel being the creative leader and Liam being the mercurial equal that wasn't really equal at all within the band - even as he was more loved by many fans. Something that only competitive blood brothers are saddled with. Add more anger, bad drugs, and recklessness to the Gallagher brothers and it seems a wonder the band achieved what it did. This is a warts and all look into their wild ride. It could have shown more shed blood, but the viewer gets it quite well with the chaos shown here. As of 2016 that chaos matters less and like Noel says the music is still here. That doesn't mean you don't pine for what could have been if a massive dose of maturity just couldn't have plopped itself down. But, you get a glimpse of why that was never really what Oasis ran on. It ran on borrowed time and in it's short time it conquered the world musically and left a lot to still enjoy. Like so much great music it was an alchemy of a certain space and time which could only exist for a finite period. This is a pretty entertaining, though often uneasy, window into that time. It's very likely to be a protracted time for any other band to get a window into Beatle Mania (i.e. mania, not importance), so watch this in a bit of amazement as it may never happen in this century, or ???"
" A journey from humble to crumble.
",0.0,0.9924,2017-02-18 00:00:00,10,"Watching this documentary/film, was like I had travelled back to 1994 and watched the next two years in a Meth induced rush. The only difference being, this time I actually was able to take it in and reflect on what a great time it was to be alive. I loved their first single/album and every subsequent single/album after that, why? Because I was carried along on the hype and the fantastic music. Liam and Noel, or should I say Noel and Liam? They created history and without really setting out with that intention, became the greatest band of the last 50 years. Life sometimes has twists, it does something that is the least expected thing you or anyone else thought would happen, then bang, nothing is the same afterwards. To be in a certain place at a certain time, purely by luck, plus to have a record company boss in the audience, well that's what I mean. Noels songwriting is the key to the success, but Liams vocals where also crucial. This film shows the rise of Oasis, from humble beginnings to becoming the greatest rock n' roll band of a generation. Their journey was like a person being at the best fireworks display ever, but with too much drink or drugs in their system. You see lots of lights, hear lots of bangs and get a bit over excited, and afterwards you say, ""What the hell happened?"" Then spend the next few years asking if you were really there at all! The relationship between the brothers was ultimately their downfall, but at least their music will still be around for future generations to listen to.This film takes you through the two years from 'Definitely Maybe' being released, to the few months after 'What's the Story Morning Glory hit the shops and the massive Knebworth gigs.Its an honest film and the views of all the people involved is given.Loved it. 10/10"
" Excepcional
",0.0,0.9575,2017-02-13 00:00:00,10,"It is undeniable that Oasis was one of the most important bands of its generation, icons and founders of the genre Britpop or ""British Pop"". Oasis's legacy goes far beyond its compositions, its songs and discs released ... it transcends a song. The legacy of the guys revolves around controversies, quarrels, controversial statements and the strong, subversive, transgressing, imposing and austere personality of the Gallagher brothers, who built all this together, without passing a false image of good young men in front of the cameras and of the microphones, even with problems between them. Who is a rock band from a small state of England (Manchester). They came to do nothing at the post of one of the best and most influential bands, with one of the biggest hits with record best selling albums in the UK. I believe it to be almost impossible, a band performing something for everything Oasis has accomplished, much because of the internet as well. People do not go to shows anymore, they do not buy more discos, nowadays, any idiot with a computer at home and record a record alone. The internet is not at all bad for a music industry, of course, but it is undisputed that it is the voice of many artists, but Oasis may have been considered a last great band until the emergence of the internet. Supersonic is an inspiring, emotional, grandiose, compelling and somewhat nostalgic account of how not Manchester boys. Noel Gallagher and Liam became dismayed to this day.MAD FER IT !"
" The Glory Days
",0.5423,0.9547,2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"Oasis were arguably the biggest rock band in the nineties. With reunion rumours circulating last year, Supersonic examines Noel and Liam Gallagher's childhood, forming Oasis, the band's explosion with ""Definitely Maybe"" and ""(What's the Story) Morning Glory"" and the inner turmoil as they became unstoppable superstars with their rebellious energy and epic songs.The documentary is framed by the band's biggest moment, two nights at Knebworth in August 1996, the band flying over the massive crowd in a helicopter.There is plenty for Oasis fans to enjoy, with home videos, rare footage (including an early rehearsal version of ""All Around the World""), clever visuals (including dialogue animated by magazine cutouts) and regular commentary from Liam and Noel, their mother Peggy, brother Paul, Creation Records' Alan McGee (who signed the band in the early nineties) and former members Paul ""Bonehead"" Arthurs and Tony McCarroll amongst others.The heated, love-hate relationship between Liam and Noel is an important part of the documentary. The brothers admit their dynamic not only made the band so successful but eventually tore it apart. Personality-wise, Noel compares himself to a cat (quiet, introspective, independent) and Liam as a dog (loud, energetic and always needing attention).The supreme confidence of Liam and Noel made Oasis the swaggering force of rock music, and comes across – even 20 years later – in the interviews. Liam and Noel have no doubt Oasis were the biggest band on the planet, embracing their rowdy, bad boy image both in the press and on the road. When other band members (like McCarroll) couldn't handle Oasis' lifestyle anymore, Noel cut ties and moved on to find a replacement quickly, the band always came first. Noel's drive for success was immense, taking on more singing responsibilities to cover Liam's occasional early finishes and throat problems. Refreshingly, Noel and Liam are candid about the band's drug use on the road (which triggered the first of numerous Noel walkouts) and the abusive relationship with their estranged father Thomas, which got ugly when Thomas started using the press (who were suckers for anything Oasis- related) to his advantage. There's a lot of respect for their mother Peggy, who raised three boys by herself after leaving Thomas.Tellingly, Supersonic finishes in 1996, ignoring the drug-fuelled mess of ""Be Here Now"", their fall from mega-fame in the 2000s (after the disappointing ""Standing on the Shoulder of Giants""), a late recovery and their 2009 split (when Noel finally walked out for good). This is for the best, as most Oasis fans would agree that ""Definitely..."" and ""...Morning Glory"" are the only albums that live up to Oasis' legacy. It's a wise choice, letting the documentary show Oasis at their very best."
" If there is a better film about a rock band I haven't seen it
",0.4404,0.8724,2017-01-21 00:00:00,10,"""Just because you can't get any bigger or any higher doesn't mean to say you can't keep doing it."" –Liam Gallagher This film is brilliant on so many levels that it's difficult to keep track of them all. The film deals only with the time in which the band went in less than 3 years from signing to a label to its apotheosis at the Knebworth concert in 1996 in front of a quarter of a million fans. Drugs used (but not abused, claimed Liam), music played and written, bands changes made told mostly in their own words in the flash when the band went from complete obscurity to total brilliance in the world of rock and roll in the mid 90s. There is an incredibly intense personal telling of this story through scraps of dialogue from the band patched together with their music. This intimate look at the band is even more remarkable considering how the story is twenty years old. An incredible achievement in film.Starting backwards I have to point out that the editing is nothing less than inspired, as inspired as the music. Just try to imagine the heaps of video clips, press releases, interview takes, photos, bootleg recordings, and police reports that went into the final product of Oasis: Supersonic.The band members are from lower middle class roots yet their intelligence and wicked sense of humor shine through thick accents and lazy grammar at every step along their narrative. I'm no slouch at foreign languages but I was very thankful for the English subtitles for all of the intensely Mancunian bits."
