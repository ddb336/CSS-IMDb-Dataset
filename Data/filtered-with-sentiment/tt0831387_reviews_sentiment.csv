" Ruined godzilla
",-0.4767,0.6554,2021-03-29 00:00:00,1,"After the amazing 1998 film by Roland Emmerich, I was looking forward to this but my god it's BAD like what were they THINKING???? They made godzilla look like some big dragon instead of his cool look from the 1998 film. The film seems a dumb dull Japanese film while the 1998 film felt like a cool sci fi action film. Truly disappointing."
" Massive Unidentified Terrestial Organism
",0.0,0.9745,2021-03-29 00:00:00,7,"I love this movie and I love Godzilla and its lore and history. The second half of the film is great. It is beat for beat enjoyable vices of fan service and character development so contrived you could throw a grappling hook up and over it. The film was undeniably inspired by the post-modern Cloverfield spectacle only they did their own thing with it. Ironically Cloverfield was inspired by Godzilla. I love every kind of Kaiju film including the ones derivative. This film focuses so heavily on the human characters that our Kaiju on the menu serve more as runway-models on a catwalk than they do as a brooding dynamic. The scenes are fleeting but mostly enjoyable however the CGI has not aged too well but I noticed that the first time around too after watching many years later. This film struggles to flaunt it's own identity, and when it does it is small glimpses in the muddled chaos. It tries to tip it's hat to so many motifs that it never breathes. I love this series but it can only improve. Good start to a modern Kaiju effort. Looking forward to GodzillaVSKong."
" Too Long. Excess Story Lines
",0.0,0.25,2021-03-28 00:00:00,3,Cranston's overacting makes his scenes dreadful. Plus some go on and on. The majority of the movie is so visually dark it's tiresome to see who's doing what. The movie is far too Why they added the little kid sub-plot is beyond me. It's like they through it in to give the son something else to do. Elizabeth Olsen scenes were easily the most visually appealing portion of the movie.
" Good enough
",0.4404,0.8966,2021-03-28 00:00:00,6,"The story is as basic as it gets in any generic ""disaster movie"". A bit of science to explain what is happening, another bit to show how humans are to blame for it, and another to say that humans are not going to control nature, ever. Fine, whatever.What makes this version of ""American Godzilla"" good enough, is the insane spectacle that gives us. It's visually stunning and Godzilla design is perfect. The rest is filler characters (although I enjoyed following Cranston and Taylor Johnson) with exposition scientists and the annoying but necessary military men. But it never gets too boring for too long and when the spectacle kicks in, it's pretty stunning."
" Very Hard to Watch
",-0.1761,0.34,2021-03-27 00:00:00,4,"I just revisited this movie in anticipation of GvK. Most of the film is very dark and I could barely see anything. Aside from the visuals the acting and story was ok, some parts dragged on a bit. Not enough Godzilla."

" a Good Movie to Watch
",0.4404,0.7992,2021-03-27 00:00:00,7,It is an entertaining movie if you like action movies. Is it perfect? Well no. It got me bored at some point. But overall I liked it.
" More Godzilla
",0.0,0.9491,2021-03-26 00:00:00,7,This movie is a strong first entry in the monster verse. The actors are really good but really wish Bryan Cranston lived longer. Wish we got to see more Godzilla since it's his movie but still really enjoyed watching it.
" NOT A GODZILLA MOVIE MORE LIKE A MUTO MOVIE

" High quality visuals. Low quality film making.
",-0.2732,-0.9721,2021-03-26 00:00:00,4,"Godzilla is a reboot of Godzilla franchise which has now spawned 2 sequels including a cross over with Kong series. Keeping in mind the fiction and fantasy involved, and history behind Godzilla ( Gojira), the production quality, this film wouldve been a master piece. Yet this is a below average film that neither impress with the story arc or any heartful moments even with the zillion opportunities it had. Coming to the film, the initial credits, music and basic story does create a good setup even though a bit bad in editing section. Following the nuclear breakdown and 15years, the entire soul of the film is lost thanks to cliche plot, pathetic acting from Aaron Taylor and a Ken Watanabe who roams around clueless. Aaron Taylor Johnson is the typical protagonist of a disaster film. He had a history of encounter with monster. He lost his mom and family life. Lieutenant in military. He gets involved with higher officials in managing monster, has a family who is clueless at first, freaks out later, and yet act dumb. There is a typical disaster film guy who predicts/knows everything but neither family, not officials listen to him until its too late. After his dad gets killed in Japan by monster attack, he reach Hawaii where monster appears too.. Their is a convenient subplot where a Japanese kid gets stuck in subway train with parents standing a feet away from him, but outside. Train is about to move. Neither of them bothers until it closes and train moves. The great hero is the only person who is concerned about him in entire train while others chill out minding their own business. Our hero protects the kid who rejoins the parents 5mins later. The wife who is worried of her husband keeps her phone in silent. Never returns the call. Or even listen to voice mail. Adding to cliche, she is a nurse working in hospital during a disaster ( independence day, amazing spiderman 2) , now has the kid next to her. But as soon as evacuation is done she sends off her son with 20 other kids and a moronic driver who can't lower his window when a police guy talks to him. Aaron Taylor watches a military march, tells them he is a lieutenant and guess what, he is in too. ðŸ˜‚. Pretty sure thats not how military works. Godzilla attacks MUTOs , explained as hunting but for what. Its never shown that Godzilla eats them or feeds on their radiation. All it did was wasted time to track them, waste its own nuclear power to kill random monsters. Film maker aimed at making the audience tensed with Aaron plot and root for Godzilla to be felt as a hero who saved the city. Succeeded in neither. Thanks to Aarons emotionless face, and a Godzilla with no purpose. I really wanted to like this film and hence a biased rating, else it'd have been 1 star. Aimless Godzilla. Clueless Authorities. Senseless plot. Cliche characters. Poor direction. Now it seems like other disaster films Independence Day, 2012 etc had so much soul in them and it is difficult to achieve. All the flawless CGI and visual effects couldn't save the film. Hope the sequel has something more juicy."
" Godzilla focuses more on the human characters than on the monster fights, and despite the narrative balance needing some adjustments, it surprisingly works quite well.
",0.2247,0.9787,2021-03-25 00:00:00,7,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)It's not easy to start off a new cinematic universe. The first installment must be an undeniable success on almost all fronts for the franchise to take off. From interesting world-building to delivering a good first film, it's a brutally challenging task for any director and writer to take on. Godzilla has been around forever, but Warner Bros. And Legendary Entertainment bravely brought on an inexperienced filmmaker, Gareth Edwards (Monsters), and a debutant screenwriter, Max Borenstein, to handle yet another version of the Godzilla story. Expectations-wise, I know that audiences look at this type of movie from an action-heavy perspective. A massive majority of the viewers just want to see monsters fighting, which is understandable. I enjoy a big battle as much as any other moviegoer, but I do desire a remotely decent story. When it comes to this particular genre, I don't ask for an Oscar-worthy screenplay that leaves me floored by the end of the film. I don't need incredibly complex, multi-layered characters with exquisite motivations. I don't even mind heavy exposition as long as it's not overdone and sluggish. With that said, I also don't want the most annoying, cliche archetypes nor nonsensical plot points. I genuinely hate myself when I get too nitpicky with ""movie logic"" issues, but when the characters make the most ridiculously absurd decisions that no sane human being would make, then the film is really asking for a negative commentary. Borenstein - who goes on to co-write two of the following three installments in the MonsterVerse - gets close to a perfectly balanced narrative, which in this genre is related to the amount of screentime allocated to humans and monsters. This movie can't just be Godzilla fighting a random monster since the visually appealing, constant battles would lose impact with time (besides the lack of a story), but it also can't waste all of its duration with the human characters - after all, the film is titled Godzilla, not The Brody Family. Audiences all over the world enter their respective theaters to be blown away by the action, visuals, score, and be thoroughly entertained by titans punching each other to death. Several characters carry surprisingly compelling arcs, especially Ford and Joe Brody. The father-son relationship between Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kickass) and Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Argo) feels authentic, with both having a common unsolved problem from their past that links to the King of the Monsters. The emotional attachment to this family elevates the dangerous sequences that the movie holds throughout its runtime. Cranston offers an undeniable commitment to his role, while Taylor-Johnson demonstrates some of the talent that would later be discovered by Marvel. Ken Watanabe (Inception, Batman Begins) is a fantastic addition to the cast as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, a scientist who fortunately doesn't follow the formulaic development usually thrown at this type of character. Elizabeth Olsen (Oldboy, Martha Marcy May Marlene) and Sally Hawkins (Blue Jasmine, Happy-Go-Lucky) also get a bit of screentime, but they're basically just ""people close to the important characters"". Gareth Edwards admittedly loves the Godzilla lore, but any viewer can tell the great care that both Edwards and Borenstein have with their characters. More screentime is handed to humanity than to the monsters, which will undoubtedly disappoint many fans. While I do feel invested in the protagonists, too much time is spent with the military, where countless exposition scenes drag the overall narrative. The suspenseful build-up to the climactic third act is efficient, but the action is frustratingly hidden from the viewers. Most of the titanic battles are seen through the windows of a car, train, building, or even TVs. The main problem with the film isn't spending time with humans when the monsters aren't fighting but choosing to remain with these characters even when Godzilla and co. Enter the scene. Titans are fighting right behind the camera, and they keep the audience either entirely in the dark or just partially show a section of the battle. Most of the shots are ground-level, usually showing the POV of a certain character. While that brings a higher sense of danger and desperation to the screen, it also generates a frustrating feeling in the audience who's not seeing Godzilla fighting in its full splendor. I understand that part of this decision might be related to some less polished VFX, and in all honesty, despite the rare wide shots of the monsters, the action is definitely entertaining and quite riveting. Alexandre Desplat's score is vibrant, and the actual monsters look gorgeous in the purposefully dark environment (helps to hide visual imperfections), especially Godzilla. Godzilla focuses more on the human characters than on the monster fights, and despite the narrative balance needing some adjustments, it surprisingly works quite well. As the first installment in the MonsterVerse, Gareth Edwards and Max Borenstein deliver an incredibly compelling story on the human side, fully developing the main characters and handing them interesting arcs. Most of the runtime is spent with these protagonists, which will undoubtedly disappoint some fans who crave the titanic battles, but the suspenseful build-up works in favor of the climactic third act. However, choosing to remain with the humans when the monsters are already fighting in the background is a questionable decision that leaves an extremely frustrating feeling in the audience. Cast, visuals, and score seem to hit the right notes, but the actual combat is rarely seen in its full glory - most of it is shown through a ground-level character's perspective - partially due to the necessity of hiding some VFX imperfections. Still, it's an utterly enjoyable monster flick that sets up a pretty entertaining cinematic universe. Rating: B+"
" AWFUL
",-0.4588,-0.7197,2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,"The only movie that has really put me to sleep, without exaggerating to say it was boring. HORRIBLE."
" Americans second attempt and they fail to deliver
",-0.5423,-0.9614,2021-03-20 00:00:00,4,"This is America second attempt at a Godzilla movie so you would think legendary pictures would try their best to make sure that it stays true to character delivers what satisfaction unfortunately that is not the case Godzilla 2014 is an all-around disappointment and a mediocre film that does not pay tribute to the King of the monsters in the slightest. The movie does start off good with war footage showing bombings of Hiroshima and the testing nuclear weapons with a decent score to accommodate it. Although The Godzilla Theme is nowhere to be found at all. This is where the movie starts to fall, most of the issues immediately derive from the fact the characters are not at all interested. Godzilla himself is barely in the movie he does not show up until about an hour 20 in this two hour long movie and when he does show up to finally fight you see very little of him and every time there's about to be a fight between The monsters. they cut away from it and they do this with everytime with exception of the final fight scene which is so damn dark can barely make out anything. Either lack of original idea or licensing issues the MUTO monsters are not interesting monsters. All the iconic Godzilla monsters and they couldn't get any from Toho. Majority of the human characters are boring it it's understandable when you do giant monster movies you need to have the monsters, and you need to have human characters to build the world around them and to dialogue and input to push the plot. However when your characters are all for the most part boring you don't care and you just left frustrated.the main character Brody the soldier is completely pointless. He is boring, it does not need to be from his perspective and he has nothing really to contribute that anybody else in his position could've outright did. It doesn't help that a lot of the monsters fighting are in the background of him in scene,Bryan Carson as the father offers more character and drive for the movie with the lost of his wife but he's killed off 30 minutes in. The main focus on the movie should've shifted to Ken Watanabe who actually has more of a connection to Godzilla and knows information about these monsters giving he part of an organization that studies creatures like Godzilla. The last big issue is that the movie jump to much all over the place, This movie should've been in Japan and only Japan.The movie slow filled with dialogue that adds to nothing, with very little monster action. A Godzilla movie and you barley focus on him it almost as bad as the tristar movie from 98."

",0.0,0.9237,2021-03-15 00:00:00,5,"""You know how long this movie took for them to reveal Godzilla? An hour! Can you believe that, first i just not really enjoyed the story, even before they reveal it or after, it just boring, i don't see any excitement in this movie, i don't like Aaron Taylor Johnson perfomance, Elizabeth Olsen is ok, and the rest of a supporting is ok too, and the fight it's pretty terrible, but i still like the Godzilla and MUTO model and the voice, they still have some good special effects, pretty good score, and one pretty emotional scene, but the rest of it is a big no!, overall Godzilla is just another fail character adaptation"""
" Dr. Serizawa
",0.0,-0.5574,2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,"I was wondering, if the Dr. Serizawa from this movie and the 1956 version of Dr. Serizawa are related as he died in the 1956 version of Godzilla: King of the monsters movie with Raymond Burr"
" Like the idea and the movie is entertaining
",0.6597,0.975,2021-03-10 00:00:00,8,The movie is good but not great. I think this one is a victim of one of those films where the second one is better then the first. I say that because king of the monsters is much better. This movie is cool for the idea that we are gonna film the movie from the people point of view rather then a monster fight movie. This more reminds me of a disaster movie like a clover field etc. I like the idea but I think they miss the Mark with that's not what Godzilla is. I still like the movie for what it is but but I give it an 8 because it misses the Mark of not having Godzilla in it a ton and there are not really fight scenes that you can see clearly because they are always showing it from the POV of a person or helicopter with the exception of a few shots. But 90% is from human POV. It still is good though and a different take. If I'm being honest see this movie so you can then watch king of the monsters and king skull island. Then of course King Kong vs Godzilla. You get much more of the classic fight scenes like you want from monsters in those and even though the one is not out yet you will get fight scenes. As far as this movie this is for sure a rent compared to the next one that was a buy for me. It is still good though and like the idea but ultimately this is a movie that is solid but but not a knock out of the park or a Godzilla fan. It's more of a drama where they try to make people to involved. Of course they make stupid decisions and don't listen to the people who clearly know what they are talking about etc. You will like it though!!
" Monstrous Spectatorship
",0.0,-0.8006,2021-03-07 00:00:00,5,"On a narrative level, these Monsterverse burgers are pretty stupid. The original allegory for atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the 1954 ""Gojira"" is lost in this ""Godzilla"" despite the incorporation of nuclear weapons in the story. The bomb here makes superpowers of monsters. The sequel, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" (2019) seemed to appreciate this, at least, and so attempted to add an environmental message, confused as it was. This one is said to recall the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, 2005 Hurricane Katrina and 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. OK, and they said the 9/11 allusions in ""Man of Steel"" (2013) were crass and overblown. These giants leave a city-razing massacre in their wake from Japan, through Hawaii, to San Francisco and Las Vegas. ""Thousands missing"" a TV report is seen broadcasting at one point; that's the least of the PG-13 horrors. Seems to me this could be argued to be just another post-9/11 defense of American military might despite the relative inability of humans to affect this narrative. Sure, Godzilla laid waste to our city, but he saved it from the other kaiju laying waste to our city. What else to make of a Hollywood production turning 1954 fears of American bombing to a, if questioning, celebration of that cinematic embodiment of those fears.Regardless, to appreciate this series, I think I need to look beyond its simplistic, if muddled, narrative and cardboard-cutout characters. Visuals, then. These blockbusters are meant to be spectacles, after all. So, I was looking for something to distinguish this from a variation of Transformers-type titanic battles as tiny people run for their lives beyond the CGI and lack of Michael Bay cutting being less of an eye sore. The most interesting thing I saw were windows. Seriously, I think this is somewhat interesting. It's a metaphor for movies--framed images seen through a screen. The camera does a lot of switching in its framing of the monsters, between omniscient views that no character beyond god or godzillas could see, more obscure looks from human view on the ground, and shots of the monsters as seen through windows. The extensive TV coverage becomes but another window through which to view the monsters, as does the top-secret film-within-the-film. The sequel might even do more of this, while ""Kong: Skull Island"" (2017), in the tradition of the original 1933 ""King Kong,"" is more about the making rather than spectating of movies. Also worth noting is that what might be the final through-the-window shot here is through a broken car window--and on the heels of the POV shot through goggles. The monsters that are the movie have entirely escaped the thin layer of safety glass separating them from the human characters that are our surrogate spectators on screen. It really puts the spectating in the spectacle."
" Give it a watch
",0.0,0.6765,2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,Fun rethink of the Godzilla mythology. Action packed. Wont disappoint.
" Good
",0.4404,0.9914,2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Wonderfully intense, from beginning to end! The king of monsters, in a grandiose film, full of nostalgic sentiment, returns with deserving in an epic proportion. There were high expectations for the remake of the new Godzilla, the monster that 50 years ago gained incredible recognition within the cinematographic world. The mission that many considered impossible to bring back the true essence of Godzilla, fell into the hands of the almost inexperienced Gareth Edwards, who brings fans a film that recalls the original merging with techniques that the current cinema offers. The film, which this time features a human drama within the script, creates the prospect of viewing on all sides the consequences caused by Godzilla and the battle of monsters across the city. When a suspicious accident happened at the nuclear plant where Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) worked, leading to the death of his wife, doubts were created as to what could cause such destruction. 15 years after the events, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Joe's son and now an adult, is the lieutenant of the American army and needs to take care of his father, who has answers about what happened, but who is not taken seriously. Gareth Edwards is a consistent fan service to Hollywood cinema today, the director creates in moments of tension, anxiety about the viewer and the right moment to release that relief of satisfaction. The script that gradually releases details about the monster and gathers aspects to keep the best in the end, leaves everyone's expectations high and does not disappoint when it delivers the promised action, on the contrary, while puffing out the chest and in the roar of Godzilla, the thrill of contemplating that is terrifyingly incredible. Perhaps it is not wrong to say that on some occasions the film appeals to the apathetic doomsday feeling as seen in many apocalyptic-themed productions, however, what Edwards relates to what humans are able to do when everything is up for grabs. water below - technologies that no longer work, nuclear bombs capable of decimating the entire city and natural disasters ready to start - reflects what it is like to be prepared for adverse situations. The director uses his techniques similar to the interesting one, Monsters, to bring together human drama and all the visual dazzle in high proportions, using techniques for positioning the cameras and the aid of the soundtrack directly affecting the viewing of the film, which at a certain moment determines Godzilla with Ford Brody, like the heroes you're rooting for. Godzilla happily delivers a visually exuberant and terrifying film in the battle of the monsters. A true film that teaches many how to cause destruction in an entire city, without the need for mind-boggling action at all times.Film seen on February 20, 2021."
" A Solid and Enjoyable Blockbuster
",0.8126,0.9922,2021-02-15 00:00:00,7,"A perfectly solid blockbuster. Everything within the film was pretty much completely solid. Solid performances, solid characters, solid action, solid story. Everything was solid. The only thing that really stood out as being great were the visuals. Gareth Edwards always has really strong visuals in his films, and this is no different. The creature design is great and the colour palette is really great to look at. My only real issue is that I wish they'd kept Bryan Cranston alive for longer - he was probably the most interesting character in my opinion, and I wish he hadn't died so early on. But still, it's just a fun film. The HALO jump sequence was probably the best action sequence in my opinion, and the ending was really satisfying. Overall, it's a good time."
" Easy and fun watch
",0.7351,0.9563,2021-02-13 00:00:00,6,This film is just fun its just that fun you can sit down press play and you will be entertained. The acting in this film is good and the story is okay but we're all here for the monsters right? right? Yeah well Godzilla is barley in his own movie instead it tries to make us care about these humans. Whilst the humans are intresting and have some depth and I was invested in some of them I was not watching the film for people and I don't think anyone was watching the film for the people. However what we see with Godzilla is so good that this film that it makes up for all the other problems.
" Great Movie!
",0.6588,0.9716,2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,"This is the Godzilla movie fans have been waiting for, it was fantastic characters,beautiful camera work and much more. Every performance in the movie is great, the one that stands out the most is Bryan Cranston's character who is trying to prove that this thing exists. But by far my favorite part of the movie is the mystery surrounding Godzilla and how the movie goes about making him a character. That was by far my favorite part of the movie. The monster action is great and I got goosebumps every time I saw Godzilla. My only problem with the movie is they don't show much of Godzilla. If they showed him a little more I would've given the movie a higher score. But other than that this movie is a great watch!"

But the acting was great with the help of Cranston & Olsen and the plot didn't seem to go all over the place, it was well thought out.

" New Godzilla Fan Here!
",0.3802,0.99,2021-01-26 00:00:00,7,"I've never been much of a fan of the franchise. I grew up in the late 90s when the 1998 movie was released and I do remember seeing it, but I can barely recall it and I also did get some Godzilla action figures as well. That was my knowledge.I just recently showed interest in these big monster fight movies and so this movie I watched first. All I can say is that I had a blast! The human characters were fine and made me just want to see the family get back together (they do), and the monster fights were epic! Every time our favorite big guy was on screen was just fantastic. Are there weak moments in the film? Yes, but they are extremely minimal and definitely ends up leaving plenty of great moments with quite an amazing monster movie. Good film to get started with in this franchise. Highly recommend!"

I love the scenes with Godzilla (even though they are mostly dark and not very long) and the MUTO's they were pretty exciting.Now for the acting.... Hmmmm. Aaron Taylor Johnson was totally wrong for this film, he didn't look convincing at all and the love scenes with the brilliant Elizabeth Olsen were really awkward, as were the parent scenes. I actually found his acting quite wooden.Am I the only one who didn't like Bryan Cranstons characters? Because I thought he was boring and again very wooden.Sally Hawkins character looked like she had been on the caffeine which was a shame and kind of embarrassing.The best actor in this move was Ken Watanabe, he was believeable and looked like he wanted to be there.I also believe David Strathairn should have had more screen time as he's a quality actor.There was simply not enough Godzilla or monster time, there was far too much boring human interaction, the movie is called Godzilla right? And not Ford?I'll still keep watching this though because as I've already said, I love Godzilla."

There is no radiation from those bombs (at last till they are detonated).

",0.0,0.9862,2021-01-19 00:00:00,6,"Let's be honest here. Nobody cares about the characters or really the plot, they just want to see Godzilla fight some stuff. And you do get that, but not really until the end.
There are three fight scenes in this movie and the first two are cut off right as they start, or they happen off screen. But the final battle is where you finally get to see some stuff go down, and it's okay, it's climatic and badass to see Godzilla destroy some stuff for sure, I just wish we got more.
I also wish that we had Bryan Cranston more in the lead role. Everyone in this, including Cranston was pretty decent. But Aaron Taylor-Johnson's acting in this was just abysmal, I truly dreaded every time he came on screen.
There were also some pretty awesome shots in this that are wallpaper worthy if you're that big of a fan.Overall a decent introduction to the MonsterVerse with some average acting, decent cinematography with a handful of awesome looking shots, and a pretty good, (yet nothing special) climax fight scene.I also have a very embarrassing and funny story about when I went to see this back in 2014 ... some interesting times."

" Gives the requisite Kaiju-on-Kaiju Action
",0.0,0.9804,2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,"OK...bottom line...I liked the movie... Next, overall ratings (subject to change): 4 out of 5 stars (80%), 7.5 on 0-10 scale. Compared with other Godzilla films: I'd still have to put the original (1954) and ""Mothra vs. Godzilla"" (1964) above it. And, though I have lately fallen in love with Godzilla: Final Wars, I'd place the new movie above that. So, overall for the ""G"" franchise, this current edition would be a solid #3 in my book. Ok - from here on, there may be a few spoilers, though I'll try to keep them to a minimum, or so as to cause minimum 'damage.' What I liked most: Godzilla vs. MUTO(s) battles Initial MUTO reveal A cute reference/homage to ""Mothra"" Doctor Serizawa - a nice reference to 1954 Gojira What I hated most: Human character build-up (though it was kept at a minimum, so this wasn't even close to being a deal-breaker). The typical trope involving family separation (probably a necessity for widening the movie's appeal, but which wasn't really interesting to myself). The title screens, where information appeared next to the main credits, then was redacted/blanked out. I was able to catch some of it, and I know that it was probably intended simply to supply subliminal information, but I wish some of it had been left on screen just slightly longer before being blanked out. When I finally get a copy of the movie, I'll probably spend some time just going through those title screens and using freeze-frame to see what was there. So, I can't really say I 'hated' it so much as it was annoying. The scene involving the unhatched young of the MUTO, which sadly brings up memories of the '98 movie One side note: I am so grateful that use of color tinting was kept to a minimum. There were a few scenes where 'orange' coloration seemed to be used, but it fit with the actual mood. Also, it was used in a quick segment of the title screens. Sound-wise, I really didn't pay much attention to once Godzilla started to mix it up with the MUTO(s). But such being the case, it must have been effective, since I really didn't have cause to wonder ""what is THAT?"", except when that was intended. Music-wise, it seemed like the cues were a little confusing. Still, when the ominous ""Uh, oh - something's up"" theme played, it did indeed seem to set the table for expectations. I'm not going to try and recap the storyline (I've tried, unsuccessfully, about four times). So, I'll mention that it did take a while before Godzilla finally made an entrance. Though the human interest portion was mildly important to establish the overall plot, it still seemed to take up an inordinate amount of time. Also (and this may be contrary to what many people may say), I feel there was overexposure of the MUTO entities - their screen-time seemed almost twice that of the title monster. And, I had believed prior to seeing the movie that the MUTO were in fact much smaller - but if they had been, then the battle scenes with Godzilla wouldn't have been so dramatic. Interesting during the first match-ups, it looks like Godzilla is, bottom line, getting his ass kicked by both MUTO, but ""G"" finally gets pissed off enough to use his atomic breath. I had been waiting seemingly forever for that moment, and as the spines (and, a friend mentioned, his tail - though I didn't really notice it's onset) started glowing, my anticipation rose to a climax as ""G"" finally blasts one of the MUTO. The attack on the second MUTO was even cooler, and brough up memories of the old-fashioned Kaiju monster battles I grew up to love. The finale, as Godzilla is leaving the city is (in my opinion) marred by a shot of a television report, with a news-ticker line mentioning ""King of the Monsters"" (egad...homage is nice, but downright kissing the original movie's ass gets old), as well as the questioning ""Savior of the city"" tag-line. So much had been made about how Godzilla would be a neutral-style creature, but that last bit seemed to be establishing him as a ""good"" monster. Though it doesn't ruin the movie for me, it does indeed cause me to shake my head, sigh a little (like ""G"" does), and just ask myself ""why?"" Anyways, that's my basic take-away from the movie."

" Godzilla could achieve higher marks if the icon appeared more often, without so much drama and with more horror scenes, but it is a great experience
",0.6314,-0.9981,2020-11-15 00:00:00,7,"Godzilla appeared in 1954 as an elegy for those killed in the 1945 atomic bombs. The new American remake of Godzilla tries to honor these two sides: it is much more dramatic and serious than ""Circle of Fire"", for example, but it still offers the rewards cathartics that fans of tokusatsu (""special effects film"") expect. After the character's first original appearances, we noticed that the character stopped being treated as an uncontrollable and unbeatable threat, to assume, under standards that we can better understand, a post of ""anti-hero""; a kind of natural protector, from the monstrous balance of nature to changes in the pattern of terrestrial fauna. Considering the conceptual root for the creation of the Atomic Lizard in the final stretch of World War II, it is impossible to dissociate the many meanings of this genesis for any other post-1954 kaiju production.Based on the Japanese film of the eponymous character and a reboot of the Godzilla / Gojira franchise. This is the second film about Godzilla made by an American studio, the first being the film from 1998. The film recounts the origin of Godzilla today as a ""terrible force of nature"", this new version opens the so-called MonsterVerse, a monster movie franchise that also includes its sequels ""Godzilla II: King of the Monsters"" and Godzilla Vs. Kong, which is due to premiere in 2021 and serves as both ""King of the Monsters"" and the 2017 movie ""Kong"": Skull Island "", also part of the franchise.Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) raised his son alone after the death of his wife (Juliette Binoche) in an accident at the nuclear plant where they both worked in Japan. He never accepted the catastrophe and fifteen years later he continues to mull over what happened, trying to find something. explanation. Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), now an adult, is a US Army soldier and desperately needs to fight desperately to save the world population - and especially his family - from the gigantic, unshakable and incredibly frightening monster Godzilla.From his first feature, Monsters, director Gareth Edwards brings his knowledge in visual effects to imagine a world where the passage of giant creatures, while causing disasters, does not seem spectacular: they are monsters different from those of alien behavior or cornered like that of Cloverfield; here they treat the land as their habitat, and the environment is shaped by them. It remains for humans to conform. In this reinterpretation of 2014, written by Max Borenstein (based on a story by Dave Callaham) we have the basic homework already included in the opening credits, a smart choice of direction to fix in the viewer's head the natural relationship that this animal has with the planet and how much the Atomic Age created, awakened or increased the destructive potential that nature keeps hidden somewhere. Legendary Pictures' ambitious production, together with Warner Bros., makes this second version an exciting journey of survival and attempted natural balance. There is hopelessness inherent in this condition, and it is from there that the film elaborates its sense of gravity and drama. It is as if humanity has always been doomed to be lost.
Superhero, monsters and catastrophes films are self-explanatory. And Godzilla fits perfectly into the last two categories. Except for details that differentiate the plot, even slightly, Godzilla films must have the giant lizard invading cities and causing destruction. And this is no exception. However, the story is conducted in such a way as not to offend the viewer's intelligence. Are there clichÃ©s? Logical. In fact, how to escape them in a film of the genre? Are there half-hearted scientific justifications that could not resist a more demanding sieve? No doubt. But, let's face it, in a monster movie, who in their right mind is concerned with the legitimacy of explanations? Whoever goes to the cinema to see Gojira basically wants only two things: a monster that is big enough to be very, very afraid, even if we are safe in the chair; and a lot of destruction caused by the monster. And if there is a fight between monsters even better.With a new vision of the franchise in this ""Godzilla"" in hand, filmmaker Gareth Edwards tried to pay homage to the various visions given to the character over the years, not only in the persona of the creature shown on the scene, but also in the narrative itself. It is a pity that this tribute ends up taking itself too seriously, although it is this same seriousness that ends up sustaining the efficient first act of the projection. Interestingly, the script manages to keep our attention by the simple criterion of growing threat. The soundtrack draws attention to the epic, the danger, the horror and the editing and mixing of sound create the necessary environment to leave us terrified, waiting for more disasters. Not only does Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack somewhat resemble that of John Williams at times, but the sound design also stands out by avoiding punctuating all scenes with the soundtrack, making great use of silence (a dramatic feature that is unfortunately underused, especially in blockbusters). Creating the necessary tension to amplify Godzilla's triumphant appearance.
Throughout the projection, we see that Edwards and Borenstein try to combine the buzzwords of catastrophe films with those of Japanese kaijuu features, playing clearly to the audience with the elements of the latter. The problem is that there is not a perfect mix between these ingredients, which ends up swelling the production a little, especially with the excess of characters' characteristic of the two genres that appear during the projection, which are either little developed or suddenly abandoned, being this especially true in female roles, with Elizabeth Olsen and Sally Hawkins criminally wasted on screen. When Bryan Cranston, the common man who becomes obsessed with tragedy, is left out, his place as a provider of scientific dialogues is taken over by Ken Watanabe, who is the chief scientist at Monarch. In this, the human scenes end up centered on Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is not exactly a well of charisma when compared to Cranston, Watanabe or Godzilla, the real gimmick of the project.While the action sequences starring Johnson fall into clichÃ©s, those that focus on monsters always call attention to creativity, which ends up frustrating the public even more with the filmmakers' insistence on turning their attention to Ford, who should have taken on a supporting role in the narrative after the introduction of Godzilla, but ends up participating in some scenes that could easily be omitted without creating prejudice with the audience's identification with the human. There is no mistake in the monster's appearance taking an hour to happen. The slip is in not delivering to him, from this point on, the role of protagonist of the tape, especially considering the direction that the story takes. The cuts of some of the clashes between the creatures during the second act end up irritating instead of generating expectations for the climax of the tape. The film's redemption is in its third act, when finally, the current generation begins to understand why Godzilla has not lost his majesty. Even with the monster's heavy movement referring to the movements of the old films of IshirÃ´ Honda, when he was lived by an actor in a rubber suit, he shows himself threatening and wild, executing his classic blows while attacking his equally monstrous and gigantic enemies, with one of them, winged, alluding to Mothra, one of Godzilla's classic opponents.And let's face it, the text's treatment of MUTOs is very good. The kaiju have a rule regarding this type of extra appearance, so there is nothing new or bad treatment of the animals in the film, nothing that we have not seen in the first three interactions of Godzilla with other creatures, namely, in the fights against Anguirus in Godzilla Attacks Again (1955); against the iconic gorilla in King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) and against the cutest and deadliest moth on Earth in Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964). Thus, when the plot points to a clash between the monsters and not a fight essentially against humanity, the work, which was already quite divided, breaks down completely. The human side loses any impact on the viewer and our attention turns only to what really matters, to what is very well treated here: Godzilla hunting and, in the end, facing the MUTOs.It was really to be expected a dark and pessimistic tone, dark photography and real touches, without comic relief as a monster movie should be. In this respect, Godzilla fulfilled its goal: a technically perfect production, whether in effects or in camera settings, without that Cloverfield hustle and bustle. He also scores points for his dramatic and violent style, for the competent cast and, mainly, for the social criticism related to the current world, different from the fears of the 50s: ""The arrogance of Man is in thinking that he has control of Nature... and not contrary. "", In the words of Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, a character present in the original film. The result of all this effort could only be satisfactory. Perhaps Godzilla could achieve higher marks if the icon appeared more often, without so much drama and with more horror scenes, but, in any case, the monster lived up to expectations and was well represented for 21st century viewers."

It helps that he acts the part well as does Miss Olsen.If it had been released in the 80's you might be impressed by the effects and story, but for me it was a little bit passÃ©. How they got funding for a sequel is a miracle?! We expect something more for our money these days and they didn't bring anything new to the story that has, lets be honest again, been done many times before (My preference being the black and white ones that they used to show late on a Friday after Roseanne), but actually there was more originality in the old Chewits adverts, that parodied Godzilla than there was in this.
They made it too long and tried to beef it up, but too much was going on and in the dark, with a very poor vocal track to really get a feel for the characters or the situation, the human element was missing. The most powerful parts of the film is a family reunion at the end and a bit with Mr Cranston right at the beginning.There's a lot that seems to get lost in translation and goes unexplained or is very convenient. I am also confused as to why Godzilla seems to take cares to avoid hurting humans where possible and fights for them to destroy the insectoids. Is there some sort of symbiotic relationship he has with our race that is unspoken?I think that with a bit more care, a trimmed story and a good edit that the film definitely could have had potential and it's a shame that it doesn't work, because they are obviously trying to reboot the genre, with a Kong vs Godzilla film due in 2021, but I won't be watching the direct sequel to this from 2019 and probably won't bother with the Versus either.I should have known it was going to be bad when I saw Bryan's terrible Just For Men job at the beginning.A lot of B listers and lower trying to make an A list film."

",0.0,0.9911,2020-08-15 00:00:00,6,"Hollywood again attempts an American Godzilla after the largely derided 1998 Roland Emmerich effort, with so-so results. The story is simple enough: Earth is threatened by powerful monsters (with precious little back story) called ""Mutos"". But it just might be a third monster, the ever-powerful and ever-endearing Gojira / Godzilla, that will save the day and be the saviour of mankind.Although these filmmakers, led by director Gareth Edwards, do deserve some credit for treating the Big G with *some* respect, they treat him almost like an afterthought. He gets *barely* any screen time, with Edwards and company spending almost an entire hour working on set-up. It isn't until then that Godzilla gets a proper reveal. In the meantime, far too much time is spent with human characters who aren't particularly interesting or engaging. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is especially bland as the hero, a military man married to a doctor (Elizabeth Olsen). The picture really loses some heart when it writes off the Bryan Cranston character (Taylor-Johnsons' scientist father, a man with an obsessive need to learn the truth). Cranston (unsurprisingly) delivers one of the better performances in this thing, although the filmmakers did assemble a decent supporting cast including Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, Juliette Binoche, and a solid Ken Watanabe as a scientist who has long hidden the truth about Godzilla's existence on this planet.The fights between Godzilla and the Mutos are good for some entertainment value; the creature design is fine and the CGI mostly acceptable. Lots of spectacle is thrown in the viewers' face, but since we don't care that much about the human characters, and Godzilla is under-utilized, it's hard to be that invested in this tale.Although nothing great, this 21st century ""Godzilla"" may yield adequate entertainment for audiences looking for their monster movie fix.Six out of 10."

Wish we got to see Cranston sharing his knowledge with Watanabe's character to piece together the events of 15 years ago. The cover up of those events and the lore behind the animals was much more interesting to me personally than the large insects destroying buildings. Those bugs also had a very boring design (perhaps they are from older iterations of Godzilla but idgaf). Found myself waiting for this movie to end the entire their act. Watanabe was supposedly a Doctor (I think pertaining to marine bio or something) but he didn't tell us much about the animals.Overall: Focus of film should have been on the lore and cover up, Cranston and Watanabe's characters and their knowledge were underutilized, I was bored by the monster fights"

I would have loved to see what was happening in Hawaii but sadly was unable to make much of it outWhat was possible to make of the actors was that they were underserved in what they were asked to do - they should be bringing the heart and be our bridge to experiencing the life of the film. They sadly did not, partly due to having little asked of them to do and, in some cases, being all too sadly forgettable when they did. It might have been an idea to switch the actors round and have Elizabeth Olsen play the bomb disposal expert - she's a far better actress than the lump of man meat we had playing the main role. You could also arguably switch Juliette with Bryan and Sally with Ken...The monsters...? Meh-nsters more like. Barely enough Gojira to warrant the film being named after them - I understand the need to maintain suspense but I've paÃ­d to see the dummy thiccness of that ass; not much was forthcoming. The Muto's were a generic, designed-by-committee pair of pointless awkwardness. There must be some book of such monsters floating round the design studios of Hollywood, for production designers to pluck from random: shame this is what was plucked on this occasion.Altogether a solid 5 out of 10.

The (1998) Godzilla movie wasn't very well received by critics and audiences who labelled the movie as boring and forgettable with laughably bad dialogue, unlikeable characters and a disappointing Godzilla creature because of this Godzilla didn't get another chance at a Hollywood style remake until 16 years later in (2014).Godzilla (2014) opened with mixed reviews from critics and audiences a lot of the complaints were about how there were hardly any scenes with Godzilla in them as the first hour of the movie tries to build up the reveal of Godzilla by giving audiences a glimpse of his spine in the water or his armour plated legs walking past buildings. The other complaint most people had was about the main character Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who's character is the focus point of the movie as he slowly travels from Japan back to his family in San Francisco with the military. Aaron Taylors performance as Ford is okay I guess but he's in a movie which for the first hour stars Bryan Cranston so next to Cranston his performance and his character just aren't as memorable or likable as Cranstons. Aaron Taylors character is basically like a magnet for Godzilla and the Muto creatures throughout the movie wherever he goes Godzilla and the Mutos just happen to be going that way aswell at one point they have a Muto look directly at him as if a 300 foot monster would pay any interest to a tiny ant sized human being after literally stepping on thousands of them throughout the entire movie it's a ridiculous and pointless scene.The movie isn't bad by any means but it's just so boring for the first hour and fifteen minutes hardly anything happens more time is spent following Aaron Taylors boring character around showing us scenes of him trying to get back to his family than it does showing us Godzilla and the new Muto creatures which should be the focus point of the movie. The last thirty minutes of the movie finally give us some good scenes of Godzilla and the Mutos fighting but it takes so long to get to it that by the time the fighting starts your already half asleep for boredom.The movie does look great especially on Blu Ray and the scenes with Godzilla and the Mutos fighting was really well done CGI so at least they got that part right but sadly you see more naval ships and fighter jets than you do Godzilla.I recommend watching this movie if you are a fan of Godzilla movies just don't expect the greatest of Godzilla movies going into to this movie if you want to see Colossal sized monsters fight I recommend watching the Japanese Godzilla movies or the 2019 Godzilla King of the Monsters movie they are far superior movies."
" The most memorable film I've seen in cinema and in dvd

" Not really my type but I did like it
",0.5023,-0.0905,2020-06-30 00:00:00,6,"The movie is simply historical about Godzilla as a very old monster that existed which I'm pretty sure that the beast is a atomic bombed reptile with very high radiation of power and blood thirst but I sort of get it the idea. The plot is kinda shameful honestly, there weren't much interesting characters as I thought there would be but expect for the one character, the father. The father was by far the interesting one and he knows that something wasn't right after the death of his wife, he knew that it wasn't just a mass destruction, it was caused by something bigger. Unfortunately he dies by fallen pieces of buildings and metal scraps, kinda disapointed... but Godzilla is the big role of the movie, the big reptilian monster is back at it again but he instead saved humanity against weird spider things that I forgot what they were called, they probably had a name but kinda forgettable. The son character is just too boring to watch... although I'm not hating the movie, I acutally liked it but although there were a lot of issues about the movie but I still liked the concept of the movie and its kinda nice..."

" The legend returns
",0.0,0.9982,2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,Godzilla final wars was supposed be to be the grand finale to the legendary king of the monsters . But there was talks about a 40 minute godzilla movie directed by the guy who directed godzilla vs hedorah but nothing very came out of that . But then legendary studio picked up at and then it was announced that we were going to be another American Godzilla movie . Fans where excited to see godzilla coming back and a little nervous because of the last America made a godzilla movie . On may 15 the movie came out well is very split among fans . So people praising it because Bryan Cranston and other people hated it because godzilla was it to much so what do i think about it . Well I really liked the movie it definitely has problems but its was a welcome return to franchise that had been dormant for way to long . Bryan Cranston is amazing in the films and it sucks that he's not in the movie all that much. Brody was fine just your typical hero character .his wife was fine she just worried a lot and that was really it. Dr ishrio serizawa is the second best character in the movie . All the other characters are pretty forgettable .some of the shots in this movie are freaking fantastic they shoot. The monster from low angle which make them fell bigger and powerful . Very similar do what they did in the original film . The music is meh i do wished they used the classic Godzilla theme but they did in Godzilla king of the monsters . The MUTOS are ok they are very similar to the cloverfield monster and they weren't all. That original but it was nice to get some new monsters instead of using the old. Is pretty unfortunate that the MUTOS are the main focus of the film and not godzilla but yet again this isn't the first godzilla movie to do this . Now onto the king of the monster himself GODZILLA he was amazing and easily the best part of the film . This godzilla felt huge and powerful and yes why is was disappointing that it wasn't a guy in suit still was pretty damn awesome . Now people had complained that Godzilla wasn't in the film all that much and that didn't bother me . Invasion of Astro monsters is one of the best godzilla movie and he's in that movie for 5 minutes . The one thing i really hated was the cutting away from godzilla. Whenever godzilla was going to do something awesome they cut away. Despite it's flaws i think this is a good movie and welcome return for the best movie monster of all time hail to the king baby.
" A worthy successor to the 1998 movie
",0.5859,-0.3612,2020-05-01 00:00:00,7,"As someone who liked the 1998 Godzilla movie and who has watched it around 5 times, I can honestly say that this 2014 Godzilla movie is a very good sequel (technically it's a reboot, but I still think it's a sequel).The movie places a MUCH smaller emphasis on Godzilla himself and he makes his first appearance 85minutes into the film! That's a stark contrast to the 1998 movie where Godzilla's first appearance was MUCH earlier in the film.The last 30minutes of the movie though is where all the action is at... It features a cool battle between the monsters and eventhough Godzilla takes a lot of unnecessary damage, the battle is still fun and believable.The entire movie is honestly worth a watch. I however would NOT recommend that you watch the 2019 atrocious movie titled ""Godzilla King of Monsters"" as that movie is quite horrible. Anyway, this movie get a 7/10 for an overall movie, and 8/10 if you compare it to other monster-movies."
" The one where they talk about Godzilla.
",0.0,-0.8096,2020-04-30 00:00:00,5,"Obviously my opinion has changed, if it's not a Toho production, then it's not Godzilla. Don't get me wrong I absolutely love the design of Godzilla he looks and sounds amazing. But the focus is too much on the human characters, and not enough on it's star. This is a very talky film, and that hurts it, if i wanted to watch a film with lots of human emotions, I'd rather watch the Green Mile, this is a Godzilla film for hell sakes, not an Academy Award winner. Now the positives, it looks amazing the creature effects are phenomenal, Godzilla is fantastic when he finally appears on screen, more then halfway through the movie, it's kind of upsetting a wasted opportunity, I wanted more chaos and destruction and monsters fighting then we got, instead of listening to the boring humans. Overall I'm being a little to generous with my rating, Just a very disappointing film that should have been more, to be honest didn't really have a chance from beginning. Yes like the original, Godzilla shows up near the end of the movie, but unlike the 54' film he ends up destroying half of Tokyo leaving the city in flames, you don't get anything like that in this movie, Godzilla is like a natural disaster that unintentionally destroys rather then doing it because he wants to, which pisses me off. And he's the hero... I mean the Toho films he's never considered the hero, but more like he shows up because he super territorial, kicks ass and it just happened that it's beneficial to Japan, either way it's a below average Kaiju film."

Last year's Pacific Rim was a fun entertaining experience, and this is no different. Something very rare happened at my screening. Everyone was cheering. The only other time that's happened was at the ""Doctor Who"" 50th anniversary movie. The beginning is slow, but by the end of the film, so much awesome stuff has happened that it's forgivable. This film is not cheesy like the originals. It's incredibly well done and I wouldn't be surprised if we got a Pacific Rim/Godzilla crossover. (Make it happen Warner Brothers!) This is a very exciting, fun movie. There are a couple of jump scares however, so if that's not your thing, rent it. For the rest of you however, I highly recommend seeing it in the theater. Just like Pacific Rim, it's a BIG movie, that you have to see on a giant screen. The acting in the movie is somewhat flat, but if you're in it for the monster mayhem, it's easy to forget about the average acting. There are a few unneccessary conversations that drag the plot out, but by the time Godzilla appears, all is forgiven. It's a big monster showdown movie that's incredibly awesome. In summary, Godzilla is a fun time at the movies.

" A new life for Godzilla, after years of being mistreated in the cinema.
",0.0,0.9845,2020-03-02 00:00:00,8,"I confess that I was never a fan of Godzilla because it always seemed unrealistic to me. The amount of bad movies with the city-destroying monster doesn't help either. So, it is no wonder that I had little expectations for this film and decided not to see it in the cinema but at home, when it was on TV.I felt, right from the start, that the film is concerned with creating a logical story to sustain the monster. The nuclear theme is there, but now it was not created by human bombs, it existed for thousands of years, drawing power from atomic radiation, like a chargeable battery. Even so, I did not feel completely convinced, given that radiation kills and, here, human beings seem at ease with a gigantic creature that certainly emanates more radiation than fifty thousand reactors. There are more times when everything sounds false and the story reveals weaknesses, but it is better not to take these issues further if we want to give the film a chance.The script is simple: it all starts with a tragic nuclear accident in Japan and Joe Brody's search for what really happened. His search causes him and his son, now an American military man, to stumble upon a hidden truth: that there are colossal creatures in the world, older than Humanity and mostly asleep, who can wake up and endanger our lifestyle. They are monitored by a secret international organization called Monarch, and one of its leaders, Ishiro Serizawa, places hopes on the strongest and most powerful of them - the Gojira lizard - to control all the rest. The rest of the film is a trail of destruction, with humans screaming, soldiers firing, things on fire and colossal creatures in titanic battles.The film features a cast full of famous stars but it is not the type of film we see for the interpretive quality of the actors nor do we have the opportunity to truly care for the characters. Moreover, most of the actors have little time on the scene and little to do. This is the case of Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen and Juliette Binoche. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is weak to lead the film but works reasonably as an action figure. Ken Watanabe is the most striking actor in the entire film, functioning as a kind of ""Master Yoda"" who knows more than everyone else and always has a cliche of wisdom up his sleeve. Watanabe always knew how to stay above the rest of the cast and give us a good job.Technically, the film is grandiose and justifies the millions in the budget. Bet on creating a threatening environment, with a lot happening at night or in cloudy scenarios, where we don't see everything. There are cities devastated to the ground, a lot of noise everywhere, dust and animalistic deafening roars. The sound and visual effects are to be congratulated, as well as the entire CGI and computing department. Well-made sets, good props, good sound mixing and editing work are also very evident. The soundtrack, responsibility of Alexandre Desplat, is competent but not impressive or epic, as it could be.Of all the films I've seen involving Godzilla, this is certainly the best. But it is the best because the others were too bad or too weak to compete with a film that has more money, more sound actors and better production values. It is a film that could be better, but it is good enough to be worth it."

There has to be a little foreshadowing, mystery, and allusion in order for this universe to build properly. I wouldn't want to see Godzilla knocking over buildings in the first 30 minutes.

" Godzilla v the something or other creatures - Same old but better than its peers
",0.5927,0.9905,2020-01-21 00:00:00,6,"You got to give these guys credit. Over the past 20 years this has been a tired & tested formula genre, and has gone through so many reboots, parodies, copies and rip-offs. The director & writers have taken the genre and stripped it bare to its core from the past, and what we have is a more grown up and interesting take on Godzilla.The special effects are good, but its the tension and build up which is excellent, as we await the inevitable clash between Godzilla and some other bizarre creatures. Compared to the masses of other monster movies, this was far more interesting. I saw a recent Japanese Godzilla remake lately, and it was just boring. This one keeps you interested through much of it.The biggest problem is that simply despite the improvements in various aspects to its peers, there's really not much more you can do with this genre. King Kong, Jurassic World etc have done much enough the same and there's little to get excited. Nothing too original, just another slant on the same old story.The ending was nothing to write home about, and the usual gung-ho US army hero was too jingoistic for me to care about.Anyhow, it was fine for an evening's viewing and better than many of its recent peers, but the genre is done like Westerns etc. It will keep getting rebooted as people seem to like remakes but all we'll see is updated special effects, and no new story. Nice try and fine effort, but that's best I can say about this."
" Godzilla 2014 is NOT a good Godzilla film
",-0.3412,-0.9972,2020-01-03 00:00:00,2,"The music was good, Godzilla's design was nicely updated and the CGI overall was effectively convincing. And that's pretty much where my praise ends. Just thought I should get that over and done with first. Now that I've got all the positive stuff out of the way, I'll begin to explain why Godzilla 2014 is so awful! It's quite possibly the worst giant monster movie I've ever seen.The vibe I got from watching this miserable film all the way through from beginning to end was as if to say the filmmakers were totally embarrassed to be making a monster-action movie. Every time a fight between the colossal creatures was about to occurre the scene would almost immediately cut away to something else happening with the bland humans in the foreground while all the cool monster action you actually want to see takes place far in the background, which is something I find incredibly irritating as heck! Even when the film decides to focus on the monsters fighting one and other, it's still no fun to watch because of the dark and dreary cinematography, which is mostly set smack-dab in the dead of night for the duration of the climactic battle (thanks to the pure darkness of the nighttime setting in the final act, I simply couldn't see a single thing that happened at all). So I guess you could say this is a giant monster movie that's specifically made for the people who don't like giant monster movies, much in the same way as how Game of Thrones is brutal and edgy fantasy for people who don't like traditional fairytale fantasy (if that's truly the case, then it's just way too dismal for me).I know what their intention was by not frequently showing off the monster all that often; I believe their goal was to try and emulate Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) in almost every possible way they could've done, by incorporating a very similar structure and pacing to that of the world's first ever summer blockbuster success story. But here's the thing, though; what may work for one particular thing, might not always work out so well for another. And you know what, guys? Not every creature feature needs to be exactly like flippin' JAWS!!! Jaws was a thrillingly-suspenseful horror film about when nature attacks with killer animals (mostly ambush predators) lurking around every corner (never knowing when they're going to strike next), whereas Godzilla is way more about actually SEEING the giant monster destruction upfront (akin to a disaster picture). Another thing fundamentally wrong with this movie is that the super-serious and ultra-realistic tone they chose to go with, just points out how dumb this whole thing really is (inherently speaking, giant monsters are supposed to be kind of a silly concept).And this is where nitpicking starts to creep it's way in. When you're not entertained on any level, then the little nit-picky stuff starts to really get on your nerves (in an annoying way). For instance; Godzilla is established early on as the predatory rival to these other two creatures (which, yeah, bear a striking resemblance to the Cloverfield monster) and this perfectly explains why he's constantly following after them like a determined bloodhound, because he's on the hunt for the both of them (this I'm fine with). But when he finally catches up and manages to kill them after a lengthy (and dull) battle in several different locations, why doesn't he start devouring their carcasses? Instead, all he does in the immediate aftermath is collapse, have a kip in the ruins of a demolished San Francisco, awake in the early-hours of the morning and head off back to the deep depths of the big blue ocean from whence he came. And a land animal of Godzilla's sheer size and mass would most definitely get crushed under its own gargantuan weight by the natural force of Earth's gravity (see what I mean now, about the reasoning behind a bored person's fault-finding attitude when they're in a bad mood).For me personally, the joyless viewing experience of the 2014 Godzilla was one where I can honestly say I downright HATED and absolutely wish to forget about."
" A Great Godzilla movie, although not the best
",0.1857,0.9893,2019-12-28 00:00:00,6,"If there is one thing Godzilla 2014 excels at it is modernising the monster for mainstream audiences. However this movie does cause a divide, I feel between long time G-fans and new-comers to rhe franchise. The movie received harsh critisism upon release, all of which is simultaneously legitimate and not at the same time.This is because by the standards of summer blockbusters there is a lack of monster action, the characters are quite bland and the plot is somewhat flimsy at best. However, by the standards of Godzilla movies, the monster action is well built up to, the characters are a lot better than most previous entries, and the plot is a refreshingly more realistic take on the monster that doesn't resort to alien invasions.As a result there can be a lot of conflict between people unfamiliar with Godzilla movies, who may be rightfully disapointed with the lack of action and plot, and old school Godzilla fans, who might appreciate this plot for at least being a step up from some of the lesser enteries in the franchise.As an old school Godzilla fan, I find this movie very entertaining and while acknowledging the flaws of this movie are real, can still enjoy it. The early death of Brian Cranston, the emotional heart of the first act of the movie, is the one thing that I cannot over look, however, because his character was the only one that wasn't an arcetype and was the best acted performance.Other flaws such as the plot and drawn-out build up to the action I can be pursuaded to overlook because this is not the worst offender in the Godzilla franchise for using those flaws. Additionally, I found the slow pace of the film and teasing of the monsters added to the tension, and made the all-out finale to be all the more satisfying.I have loved and enjoyed Godzilla films that could easily be described as worse than this one, and posted positive reviews to this site; So it seems unfair for me to gang up on this movie that I also enjoyed, even if it was lesser than the classics.A faithful and respectful US adaptation of the monster that has the ability to entertain."
" Not as bad as everyone says
",0.431,0.9829,2019-12-05 00:00:00,7,"I made an account to write this review because I saw a lot of people giving this movie crap but it's actually a lot cooler than given credit for. The main characters are a little shallow but still fun to watch nonetheless. The score is fantastic. Love the suspense and awe factors as well. There's also a lot of awesome sounds in the movie which please my brain. My biggest problems with this is there isn't enough Bryan Cranston and the first ""fight"" (???) scene."
" 2 hours of pure boredom
",-0.3182,-0.8197,2019-11-19 00:00:00,3,"The movie plays when Godzilla occurs always in the rain and in the dark, so that you could see little. Other films like ""Jurassic World (2015)"" have shown that you can make good and decent CGI in daylight. Why does the action take place only in rain and in darkness? Did not the budget suffice?
It is also often shot, but that is a minor matter. Because a gigantic cockroach threatens the city and Godzilla fights against these and for the people. During the film, I could have fallen asleep, after the movie, my tiredness disappeared again. That speaks well against this movie."
" Muto's are boring
",-0.3182,0.9903,2019-11-15 00:00:00,3,"'Godzilla' is mainly Muto's and their defining feature is boringnes. Even their sex lives. Graphic depictions of reproduction by gigantic, ancient, supernatural, monster, insects. Even that's boring. They can't carry this film. In part because their supposed capacity to be a parasite to Godzilla is oddly bypassed..... That's gotta be the real story angle with this set up surely!? But no. No. It isn't. Possibly designing them to resemble the beast from 20000 fathoms would have injected some non-boringness into them by being a kudus gaining reference for monster movie fans?! But no. No. They didn't.As many people have said this film is structured as a slow burn story, mainly availing the audience of snippets of Godzilla until he is unleashed in the climactic engagement with the Muto's. Snippets eventually have skirmishes added to them until the big kaboom fight.It's nice to know that the monsters in this film have read their fair share of film scripts. So that they know how to behave. Entirely the opposite of the monsters in the director Edwards' breakout film.By contrast the madness and of the Japanese Godzilla is gone. Why make Godzilla films if they're not mad? It's the main crazy enjoyment that I get from them! Sometimes watching Japanese Godzilla films I'm not sure if I have any sense of any sense at all and that's utterly absent in this film. The film makes rigid sense.Also Godzilla himself is surely a direct agent acting on humanity within Japanese film traditions: either as our enemy/destroyer/agent of judgement or as our odd/mad protector. From space alien giant robots and other denizens of ""Monster Island"" and such like.Here Godzilla seems remote to humanity as a whole. Apart that is, from one American family possessed of truly prodigious ""right place right time"" capacity. It's good to see that they read film scripts too!As another attempt to make an American version of a Godzilla film this is to my mind a failure.For me the actual artistic design of Godzilla has some good in it and his smashing sky scrapers with impacts from his prone body is actually quite cool in it's solid way. The skydiving military sequence is a proper piece of blockbuster filmmaking in my opinion.Therefore personally I rate this film 3/10; a notch above barely dismal level because one or two sequences of good visuals, one scene outstanding, are included."
" A great disaster flick
",0.0,0.809,2019-10-28 00:00:00,8,"One of the biggest reasons why I love ""Gojira"", amongst a bevy of other things, is that it felt like a disaster movie just as much as a monster movie. It's a style only the original possessed, until 2014 when Gareth Edwards got ahold of the product. That's why one of the main reasons Godzilla 2014 worked for me, it pays more tribute to the Original 1954 piece more than the others. It could have easily been a Pacific Rim-style beat em up, but it took the risk to not go with that style. (Instead it waited for ""King of the Monsters"" to do that) A G-fan may watch this movie and complain about the lack of action and more anthesis on the characters, and to that I say the original 1954 one had more anthesis on the characters too and, once again, this film is paying tribute to more of that then all the other ones where the action and entertainment is higher. When the monsters fight in this movie though, it is one of the best brawls of all time. It is extremely satisfying and that's why I don't mind the rest of the movie having slow buildup. This film is not only a good monster movie, it is also a great disaster flick."
" The last half hour almost makes it worth while.
",0.1621,0.8466,2019-10-27 00:00:00,5,"The last hour hour or so of ""Godzilla"" is quite good. Unfortunately, it's not enough to save the movie. The first three quarters of this movie is not so hot. The biggest problem with this movie is that most of the monster stuff takes place at night and you can't really see what's going on. It's annoying. The cast and the acting are okay at best. Bryan Cranston's performance is as bad as his wig. I don't mind stars making a cash grab. They should strike while the iron is hot. But they should at least try to do a good job. Cranston, however, seems to be mailing this one in. He's a real detriment to the movie. Overall, ""Godzilla"" is a mostly forgettable movie. On the plus side, they'll never stop making Godzilla movies so there's always hope."

" Surprisingly bad and stupid!
",-0.7177,-0.9865,2019-10-23 00:00:00,4,"I found the acting to be mostly good through the movie considered what the actors had to work with. The same goes for the fighting scenes between the monsters, the music and the special effects. But when it comes to the script, more or less the basis for the entire movie, it was so bad that it ruined the entire movie!The monsters was ""of course"" bullet and bomb proof ""as always""...!Monsters that were developed millions of years ago had the ability to give of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) at will!The creatures that were developed millions of years ago knew exactly when to give of an EMP to make modern planes crash and to cripple boats, trains and so on!When a boat or a train had stopped because of an EMP, they just needed to wait for a while, and then suddenly the boat or train and so on was just fine again even if an EMP damages electronics PERMANENTLY!Radiation that damages genetic material in everything else alive was used as a source of energy for two of the three monsters in the movie!In stead of learning from their mistakes, the military just continued to send in equipment with electronics that would be damaged by an EMP, in stead of using equipment from for example WWII without any electronics that could be damaged by EMPs!After finding out that two out of three creatures gets energy from radioactivity, the military continues to put radioactive material in the path of the same monsters that the military KNOWS feeds on radioactivity!Radios and tracking devices containing electronics does not get affected by an EMP even temporarily despite everything else that contains electronics does!The ""hero"" in this movie is the hero because he is the son of a man that was at the site of the original disaster, because he remembered a couple of sentences his dad told him, and because he can disarm bombs because of his background with disarming bombs in the military. Therefore he is apparently the only person capable of several things and is immediately taken in by other military forces, no questions asked wherever he goes during the movie!His experience with disarming bombs of course also qualifies him to perform a High Orbit Low Opening (HALO) parachute jump in no time, and opening his parachute below the altitude of roof levels!If you can look past the stupidity of the script, factual errors and its huge plot holes, you might be able to enjoy this movie. But if you can not, then you too will probably dislike this movie."

" A blunderous reboot that's barely better than the '98 Godzilla.
",0.3832,-0.9956,2019-09-17 00:00:00,4,"This year marks the 60th anniversary of the original Godzilla film, when the King of the Monsters first emerged from the Pacific and terrorized Tokyo, Japan. Roughly 10 years after America dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end World War II, Godzilla was artistically created to be a physical, living representation of the destructive force of those bombs. Even the texture of his skin is modelled after keloid scars, which were found on survivors as a result of the radiation. Godzilla's arrival and subsequent attacks were spurred by the use of nuclear weapons, and he as a character wholly embodies the consequences of nuclear warfare.60 years later, Godzilla remains a global icon, having spawned dozens of movie sequels, while introducing several other enormous monsters to battle with. Then 16 years ago, he was reimagined as he first came to America in Roland Emmerich's lackluster 1998 film Godzilla, leaving many fans severely disappointed with not only the film, but also the new rendition of the famous monster. While Godzilla is visually depicted much more accurately in Gareth Edward's new 2014 Godzilla than he was in '98, his entire presence is surprisingly different than usual. This isn't the angry, vengeful Godzilla of the past. He actually now seems almost entirely indifferent to humans. Unfortunately, as promising as this new Godzilla movie may appear to be, it falls far short of expectations, and dare I say, it isn't even much better than the 1998 Godzilla.Godzilla (2014) starts off pretty well, strengthened by the performance of Bryan Cranston, who plays Joe Brody, a nuclear power plant engineer living in Japan. Brody is present when an unknown disaster occurs at the plant, costing many innocent lives. Despite what the trailers suggest, Cranston's Brody is not the main character of the film. Nor is it fellow all-star actor Ken Watanabe. The main character is actually only seen for about 4 seconds of the film's original 2 and a half minute trailer. It's Joe Brody's son, Ford, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, in a performance that is decent but far from engaging. The protagonist Ford Brody is a character that is largely uninteresting, and who just casually wants to get back to his family after the monster invasion. He fails to convey any genuine sense of urgency amidst the chaos, although the same can be said for the entire cast, with the exception of Cranston's Brody. Cranston's performance is the only one that has any emotional weight to it, but he can't carry the film alone. Meanwhile, Ken Watanabe is essentially reduced to being the quiet, ever-present voice of reason that no one wants to listen to. The film has a solid cast of actors, but they're not given enough to work with in this convoluted mess of a movie.For a movie that has so much death and destruction, the people in the film never seem all that concerned. You get no sense of global panic and hysteria. You have a 300-foot-tall monster destroying cities, with millions of people dying, and yet nobody seems all that freaked out by it. It's almost like the situation isn't treated as a serious threat, and there's a major lack of suspense altogether. There's rarely any edge-of-your-seat terror or excitement, and the lack of emotion just makes the action come off as sort of flat and dull. Not only that, the majority of the destruction that's taking place isn't even seen, with the movie instead opting to show you the aftermath. Throughout the first two-thirds of the movie, the camera continuously cuts away from the action you've been waiting for. Rather than showing you what you want to see in full-glory, the movie frequently will take you to a different location where you'll briefly see a few seconds of the catastrophe being watched by someone on television. It feels like a cheap trick to build up to some amazing climax, but it's incredibly frustrating. It's like when watching a reality TV show and then the show cuts to a commercial break before revealing the winner. Perhaps it would be more forgivable if the end was enjoyable, but even though it does give you a full display of the showdown, it's bogged down by a tiresome human story and still lacks any real emotional punch. Despite the fact that the movie tries to convey a serious tone, it's also incredibly cheesy. To the extent that the big finale that this movie has been trying so hard to build up to ends up being almost laughable. Ultimately the movie ends up just being unsatisfying, disappointing, and overly long.There are a lot of ways in which Godzilla goes wrong, despite the film's great potential. One of my issues is with the musical score, which ends up coming off like a bad punchline. Music is supposed to accentuate the action and drama of a film, yet the film feels emotionless and boring. The only time the music really stood out to me was when it was being used to heighten the suspense of the climactic battle, and essentially narrate who was winning. It was done so ineffectively that it was both kind of comical and embarrassing. I also have an issue with all of the special effects, which are being touted as absolutely amazing. They're not. However, I will say that the use of special effects in the movie is quite ambitious, but it works to the film's detriment. There's simply too much of them, and this excessive nature of the film is, I think, its biggest mistake. Godzilla (2014) is ridiculously CGI-heavy, and while their scope is admirable, I really think the quality would have been substantially improved if they didn't overdo it so much. I think a less-is-more approach would have benefitted the film in many ways. It's excessive to the point of making good things turn bad. Everything is way too over the top, causing the action to lose its impact. It's evident the filmmakers were trying so hard to make this big-budget movie as epic as possible, but this enormous scale ends up backfiring. The rampage covers two continents, multiple cities, and even traverses the length of the Pacific Ocean. I can appreciate their attempt, but the movie is trying to do too much. In other words, Godzilla (2014) bites off more than it can chew.I also have some problems with the film's treatment of the titular character, Godzilla. First of all, for a movie named after him, he sure doesn't appear much in it. He's the reason why we want to see the movie, but he's absent for the majority of the film. Even when he's around, he's largely obscured by CGI smoke and storm clouds, up until the final moments of the movie. I'm also not particularly fond of his appearance. He just doesn't quite look like Godzilla to me. It's like looking at a T-Rex head on Godzilla's body. I'm aware that Godzilla's facial appearance has changed many times over 60 years, but something just doesn't look quite right here. Additionally, I feel that Godzilla's face is actually too expressive in this new film. I wonder if this was done to cause viewers to feel more sympathetic to him, because in the film, Godzilla is actually depicted as something of a tragic hero, rather than a colossal beast. This is my biggest concern with the movie's handling of his character. Godzilla's destruction in the film is treated like it's all unintentional, and just a result of his massive size. Even though humans attack him, he's not angry about it or anything. Never mind the movie's claim that all of America's nuclear bomb tests after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were actually secretive but unsuccessful attempts to kill Godzilla. He doesn't mind. He's just a poor gentle giant that's misunderstood. Really, Hollywood? Give me a break!To say that Godzilla (2014) is almost as bad of a film as Godzilla (1998) is a statement that I don't take lightly. It's a bold and controversial thing to say, and it may seem a bit absurd considering that this film goes in the right direction, whereas the previous film was all wrong from the beginning. Yet while the new movie has all the right pieces for greatness, it extends its reach too far and attempts to do too much, while never managing to make any of it very good. In all seriousness, I was more entertained with the '98 film than I was with this one. I can hardly comprehend how a movie with a giant 300-foot-tall monster destroying cities can be so boring. Godzilla (2014) focuses so much on trying to build up to an epic conclusion that it forgets to worry about making the audience care, or even about keeping them entertained, and it just gets worse as it goes on. It repeatedly tries to raise the stakes, as well as our expectations, while attempting to delay gratification until the end. It's a risky move, and unsurprisingly, it certainly doesn't pay off. On the bright side, Godzilla (2014) is probably a pretty sweet movie if you're a 12-year-old. There's plenty of action, some cool special effects, and he's still a pretty awesome monster. However, for me, I was totally pumped up for this movie, but an hour and a half into it, I had endured enough and wanted to walk out. Godzilla (2014) disappointed me on so many levels. It's a movie without a beating heart. It's predictable, overly long, has uninspired characters and a weak story, and the action just never hits the right note. A little more emotion and a little less CGI could have a gone a long way in making this movie better. As a fan of Godzilla, I felt frustrated, detached, and perplexed with how they were able to do so much wrong when they had the groundwork for something great. You know, perhaps I'm wrong in claiming it's comparably bad as Godzilla (1998). After all, the last time I saw that movie was in the theaters when I was 12."
" Entertaining; One-Dimensional Characters
",0.4404,-0.4839,2019-09-16 00:00:00,7,"Review:
'Godzilla' is an American monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. The film is a reboot of Toho's Godzilla franchise and is the first film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. Most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion, it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The action in this this movie is really well done, and they don't over do it with explosions or unnecessary violence, which is shocking.
In the film, a soldier (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) attempts to return to his family while caught in the crossfire of an ancient rivalry between Godzilla and two monsters known as MUTOs.
Its almost futile to talk about the performances in the film because despite the strong cast, the characters are all one-dimensional, and nobody delivers a memorable performance. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche do their best with the little screen time they are given, and the couple of Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are given the impossible task of creating interesting characters from the uninspiring dialogue. They can't create good chemistry between them either, because the only have two scenes together and are apart for the rest of the film. I didn't like that the story is still very Americanised in the fact that it is a very white cast even though the bulk of the film is in Japan.
Say what you will about the shake cam, or the fact that you don't see the God of Monsters that much. This film is balls to the wall entertaining as it should be being a Summer Blockbuster. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is kidding themselves.
Overall, this movie has a good story with very entertaining action scenes. The characters are unfortunately not fleshed out enough to care about what happens to them. The only character in the movie you are rooting for is Godzilla himself.

The plot revolves around wanting to release ALL kaiju to ""reset"" the earth using, and I kid you not, the ""radiation left behind"" to promote ""growth.""
Just absurd, seeing as how No One can live in radiation dense areas. Would have been better if the protagonists just wanted to wipe humanity off the map. But, of course, it would not have fit the arc of divorce and parents struggling with the loss of a child...
And Godzilla? Well, it does make an appearance, but honestly- Mothra is a more likable and better designed character.

The movie is so jampacked with awesome moments that you're find it hard to decide which is your favorite moment though my favorite part was the sky dive from the HALO. The designs of the monsters were amazing and their concept was brilliant. However, the movie does have flaws the human characters from the movie isn't satisfying or engaging enough for you to connect with them to feel for them and they're and it's plot narrative is based more on the MUTOs the archenemy of Godzilla than Godzilla himself which makes you feel like Godzilla as a secondary character rather than the titular character plus in a movie named after Godzilla he hadn't had much screen time."
" Faithful adaptation
",0.4404,0.9918,2019-08-17 00:00:00,8,"This review contains spoilers.Godzilla is a 2014 monster movie that is directed by Gareth Edwards. The movie's screenplay is by Max Borenstein, and the story is written by David Callaham. The movie stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, and Elizabeth Olsen. A nuclear power plant suffers a catastrophic failure leading to several deaths in the power plant staff. A father and his son investigate and discover evidence of titanic monsters.Godzilla is a movie that one watches for the spectacle. The spectacle here is impressive to watch with every scene having an epic feeling. The movie is shot incredibly well. The only disadvantage to the movie is it may appear too dark. This was not a problem for me as the movie wanted to have an apocalyptic feeling. The CGI and effects still hold up even in the overly dark cinematography of the movie. Godzilla and the MUTOs are impressive to watch and they cause many grand scenes to appear. Even the introduction of the military in observing the creatures is incredibly well done.What separates this Godzilla movie from the 1998 Godzilla movie that was directed by Roland Emmerich is that this one focuses more on the human characters. The human characters have more important roles in this movie as they serve as gateways to the monsters and the audience's connection to them. Surprisingly they even help Godzilla deal with the threat of the MUTOs. It was important for the human characters to exist and they offer good characterization. Bryan Cranston delivers a great performance in this movie along with Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Elizabeth Olsen. The characters do not have deep characterization but they have enough to make the movie enjoyable.The sound in this movie is awe-inspiring. Every military vehicle has a great distinct sound. The monsters are also impressive to hear. This movie is best enjoyed with a grand sound system as the movie wants to immerse the audience in a great auditory experience.I would recommend Godzilla.Grade: B"

The build-up is very slow, the creatures design is copied and pasted.

Years have passed, and they still make these old-school movies, all with the same plot. At least, the Godzilla from 1998 tried to stun the audience with updated effects, some (bad) humor and the ""size matters"" refrain.

",0.0,0.6447,2019-07-29 00:00:00,9,"British Director Gareth Edwards (veteran of the SUPERB 2010 film ""Monsters"") steps in for this umpteenth Godzilla reboot, which offers an interesting mix of grand-scale (pretty realistic-looking and flag-waving) military involvement and at times rather surreal or impressionist-looking monster scenes. Given that Godzilla is (in line with tradition) a guy in a monster suit (that's TJ Storm), that seems wise.Godzilla's enemy is the radiation-loving MUTO creature (in fact two of them, with babies set to hatch at any moment), and here we presumably resort to other techniques to screen these flying-swimming-walking and on-fire creatures never fully identifiable at any point in the two hours, but looking a tad like a more robotised version of the arachnids in ""Starship Troopers"".Anyway, Godzilla is a hero figure (breathing blue fire), who - true to the original concept - (eventually) rids the world of those pesky bugs. Crediting him with ""saving San Francsico"" seems to be going a bit far, since he destroyed almost as much Frisco infrastructure as his enemies during the course of their fight!While the detonation of a nuclear bomb just a few miles offshore is ridiculously under-emphasised in terms of its effects, the story is mostly followed logically otherwise (to the extent that the main concept can ever be logical), and deftness of directoral touch is to be witnessed at many moments in the film.
Perhaps unfairly - but also in the interests of authenticity - every reference is made here to real-life destructive events like Chernobyl, the tsunami in Japan, Fukushima, and 9/11; and this stokes up the impact considerably. This also means eccentric moments and weird juxtapositions of the intact and non-intact that such scenarios really do denote.Perhaps rightly, actors are not too important to this story, though the most familiar faces are Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche (sacrificing husband and wife in the context of the movie's leeeeeeeengthy scene-setting phase), as well as Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins; and all do what they have to do well enough. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is rather there but not there...But mostly this is a disaster+monster movie handled well, taking its time to a surprising (and mostly telling) degree, with a lot happening out in the dark and in the depths or in the distance, and assuming the necessary creepiness that that entails.Scary it aint, but atmospheric certainly yes..."
" Great: 9.0

With it comes memories of nuclear destruction, giant monsters, and that godawful 1998 travesty of a movie. This is the first Godzilla film (American or otherwise) in ten years. And now, with a colossal hype train behind it, the king of the monsters is finally back. Was it worth the wait? Alright, maybe it's not REALLY worth a decade, but the new Godzilla is a damn god film nonetheless. The only major flaw is its slow start. And when I say slow, I mean very, very slow. Sure, a nuclear power plant collapses and the presence of the to-be-revealed creatures is hinted at, but just be prepared for some long stretches of dialogue before anything really picks up. But once it does, it becomes abundantly clear that Godzilla is arguably the best monster movie of the new millennium. The visual effects are spectacular, and the sound design is sufficient to shake the seats in the theater. It's an experience like nothing else."

This is more of a suspense thriller with action. I think it would have helped if i had the mindset that i've evolved to, being open to all possibilities when i start a movie instead of expecting something and being disappointed. I kept my original review at the end for reference lol.This movie was pretty awesome. I thought about going all the way from 3 to 7 but i hesitated, maybe on third viewing (yes, definitely a 7). It was suspenseful, the music was awesome, and the monster scenes were epic. I still think godzilla himself was a little slow and clunky and there were a few tease moments where i wish they would have just stayed on the fight instead of cutting away, but this was a very enjoyable experience the second time around (and third). (3 viewings, 3/28/2021)original review - 3 out of 10 - just didn't like it. Wasn't my style. Most of the movie was a tease, not being able to see what's happening or having an obstructed view. Got bored during it. Didn't feel for the monster like they wanted me to. And I know they were trying to be like the original but Godzilla just looks fat, ugly, and stupid. Liked how he looked more zalama in the 1998 version better."
" Awsome remake.
",0.0,0.9491,2019-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Although I can't watch all of Godzilla series, I watched even a previous movie for preparing for new one at least. Maybe I watched some of them in my childhood but I've forgotten. So I enjoyed the setting and the concept purely.Hollywood version Godzilla had a thick neck! I guessed its design made sense more in physically than the original one like animations. I felt like I would be traumatized on the aliens similar to large insects. But it was kind for me because it didn't burst like MIB. It was doubt whether it had much of a presence though.
I know a famous episode of ""Shin Godzilla"" that Godzilla's skin was based on bitter melons. How about Hollywood version's? Don't tell me that it was based on the same!In some scenes, I couldn't see in detail because of the darkness, but the story was simple and clear. I felt a good thing was the story without a twist."

But when Godzilla finally appears (definitely an intentional tease for half the film and worth it) the realism is astounding.The story, well it's alright I guess. There's clearly a hint towards our obscene misuse of nuclear power and the waste it produces. But it's still better than a lot of monster movies. I'm not how the protagonist survives though. That's probably the most unlikely part of it all.This is, in my opinion, the Pinacle of all gigantic monster movies and absolutely the best Godzilla movie so far. Hopefully the new one doesn't stray from this format and gives us the same suspense. I haven't seen King of Monsters yet so I'll wait to review that.But this. Oh my!

The film is thrilling with some very memorable scenes involving Godzilla and the MUTOs. It's use of CGI and monster designs are on a scale that is fitting to the stature of Godzilla. However, the human element of the film really drags the entire movie down. The lines are too cheesy, characters aren't introduced properly nor do they have significant motive or character development, leaving me to wonder at times a whole lot of ""why"" and ""how"". From Bryan Cranston to Elizabeth Olsen, everyone feels a little awkward and forced in the film."

" The Godzilla movie for people who hate Godzilla movies
",-0.5719,0.9197,2019-06-06 00:00:00,1,"So, I watched the trailer for this and saw a lot of destruction scenes, several of which are not in the movie, a few scenes of Godzilla, several of which are not in the movie and the guy from the show, BREAKING BAD, and I think almost all his scenes are in the trailer. He's barely in the movie. There is another ""actor,"" who plays the lead when the guy you thought was the lead suddenly stops being in the movie. There are some monsters in the movie but they aren't the ones you expect, especially when you paid to see a movie called, GODZILLA. Even when the main attraction finally shows up, he's mostly confined to reflections in windows and on
TV monitors. If you enjoyed the movie, THE VILLAGE, after seeing the trailer for it, you will love this version of GODZILLA. If you really just pretty much hate Godzilla movies, then this is the movie you've been waiting for, because you won't have to worry about seeing him
much. The director cuts away to
something far less interesting anytime you think you're about to see him. If you could give the same crew and budget to director, Ed Wood, of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE fame, I bet even he probably could have made something more entertaining than this endurance test, that costs the price of a movie ticket. I still don't see how they messed this movie up so bad, but the problem started when they promised the audience things they didn't deliver...such as a giant radioactive lizard monster."
" Slow burn to a fault
",-0.4019,-0.2657,2019-06-06 00:00:00,6,"Gareth Edwards' version of Godzilla is known for taking the unique approach of waiting long into the movie until showing the titular monster and then showing very little of him the rest of the film. It's bold and different, but ultimately it doesn't result in an appealing showcase for the character we all want to see. I don't really care about the uninteresting human characters that take up most of the screen time, I want to see GODZILLA."
" Been on a Kaiju kick lately (1 of 3)
",0.0,0.9864,2019-06-04 00:00:00,7,"[7/10] - ""Met expectations""I admittedly don't have as much to say about this one as I do it's two sequels.
This is mostly because I've heard most of my thoughts voiced better by other people. For example, I agree with Bob Chipman that the movie would have been better if it had focused on Ken Watanabe's character rather than the rather generic main family. While Godzilla is strangely absent from the movie, this wouldn't have been an issue had the main cast been more interesting.I will say, the movie is an example of really solid filmcraft. The cinematography, while dark, is also (usually) adequately clear. Godzilla almost always looks fantastic on screen (I actually think he looks better here than in the sequel).And there is one sequence I want to shower with praise, when the bomb-team is skydiving into the Kaiju battle. I've always felt that a Kaiju series would be best if its creatures were portrayed as Cosmic Horror, much like the Great Old Ones in Lovecraft. While this would have created an excessively delicate racial subtext in the Kong film, with Godzilla, I think it is appropriate. The skydiving scene, more than any other, captures the Lovecraftian angle. Not only is Ligeti's ""Requiem"" a suitable callback to the Cosmic Horror in *2001: A Space Odyssey*, but the cinematography has an amazing way of creating scale. The broad skyline shots, where they skydivers are mere specs and trails of red smoke, are interspersed with POV shots by the skydivers. Their POV is limited by their goggles, and we only see the monsters fighting in brief flashes of light. When we drift close to Godzilla, we get the first proper sense of his might and our own insignificance in his presence. The goggles too serve as an excellent visual metaphor for the ways in which our human perspective limit what we can see and understand. By constraining the sight of the audience, they communicate the constraints of our comprehension.It was just a magnificent sequence. I can't say enough in its favor.{MILD SPOILERS FROM HERE FORWARD}
One of my general criticisms is only in the light of seeing its two sequels, in that it seems like the Godzilla movie's are a little trigger happy with the nukes. ...Like... I get it. Godzilla is almost always about nuclear weapons on some level or another, but their overuse makes them feel a bit anti-climactic. Not to mention, I feel like their destructive power is ultimately underwhelming considering how few people they actually kill. The sequel's use of such WMDs would have been more satisfying if the nuke in this film had been successfully deactivated and if everyone had sighed with relief. Then the actual use of them in the sequel would have more weight."
" The MUTO Movie, featuring Godzilla
",0.0,0.8654,2019-06-02 00:00:00,6,"I saw this movie opening night in 2014 and boy did I love it. Until I let it sit in and the more and more I think about it, it's kinda boring and underwhelming in some aspects.The positives:
Gareth Edwards's direction is absolutely amazing. He shoots Godzilla low and from human perspective which gives Godzilla a grand scale. The last 10 minutes are also really good and some of the best in Godzilla history.The negatives:
The human characters are really boring, besides Bryan Cranston. Everyone else just seems either bored or uninterested. It's like they were only there for their paycheck and could care less how they acted. And it's weird because the cast is full of really talented actors and actresses. While I praise Edwards for his direction, unfortunately, he doesn't know how to direct actors. The movie is also very dark but not like dark-toned but dark like where are the colors? You can't see the monsters fight at the end and you can barely see what the humans are doing at night.Edwards is very ambitious for teasing Godzilla. He doesn't come onto screen until nearly an hour in. I like the teasing but what kills it, is that the human characters are boring and when Godzilla is not on the screen, they are and it can be tough to sit through. This isn't a traditional Godzilla movie. This one tries to be more grounded and focus more on the humans, which I'm all on board for, but the characters are just terrible. But at least you know their motives and stuff.The movie also focuses more on the MUTOs than Godzilla. When you really look at it, it's more of the MUTO's movie than Godzilla's. It's not how much screen time Godzilla has is the problem, it's how it is used. They pretty much use all of it at the end and like I said, when Godzilla is not on the screen the boring human characters are. I don't have a problem with the movie being more character-based than action-packed but as I said, what kills the movie are the characters and since they have about 80% screen time, it can be rough.To sum things up: Ambitious but at times boring. Not the worst Godzilla movie."

Yes, it's ridiculous. It's a flipping GODZILLA movie. What ISN'T ridiculous about giant monsters?It's fun, there's enough of a plot to keep you interested, a human element and most importantly, giant monsters kicking butt and tearing things up.One thing I've also noticed is that while critics at say, that ""RT"" site are sitting at around 40%, the actual viewer of the movie are rating it up near 90%.I'd say this: Listen to the people. Critics are rarely right, and they rarely like movies like this anyway. Go see it and if you remotely like Godzilla movies, you'll very much enjoy yourself."

The movie is more about an estranged father and son reconciling over the death of the mother. Those parts that do feature the titular star are almost always night scenes making it mostly impossible to actually see whats going on.

Without giving spoilers away some other monsters pitch up and this tempts Godzilla to rise out of the ocean and do battle, almost like a turf war of sorts. He doesn't like them hanging around his hood. So whilst the others cause carnage we see glimpses of the big dog. A bit of a tail, a spikey back. It's only the final quarter of the movie he does his thing. I quite liked it when he did, I wanted more. The CGI was fine and I liked the way he looked although at times my wife did say he was a big chubby and really cute. The movie had a really good Japanese Manga feel to it, sticking to its roots, which I liked. I also liked the nuclear back story. What I didn't like were the humans involved. The young guy playing the lead was annoying and there were just so many plot holes where he was involved. Way to many coincidences happening just to make the lame human sub plot work. I also didn't like the way Gods was treated like a hero when in fact he added to the carnage and death that followed. I will watch the next one but my take on it is less humans please and more Godzilla, that's what I say."

",0.0,-0.9612,2019-05-19 00:00:00,2,"I initially viewed this in the theater when the film opened and this review is long overdue. In anticipation, or more accurately hope of the next film being good I revisited this movie this morning. And it was even worse than my first time.After the utter travesty that Godzilla 1999 was, how is it that a major reboot is handed two writers that have neither a solid history or film under their belt - one much more than the other? And how, or why is it that the director's chair is handed to someone that made a 'monster' film with no monsters in it? Seems on paper it's just as horrid a choice as it was in the end. Want to see a Godzilla film ultimately about a human protagonist being everywhere at the right time with plot armor that would make any major Game of Thrones (HBO) character jealous? Want it topped off with blatantly generic, unpolished writing, complete with bland generic characters? This might be for you then... But it sure irritated me throughout. I grew up watching Godzilla and friends every Saturday, and this my friends, is not what we should have been given. With the exception of Cranston and Watanabe the characters and acting is on par with the 1999 'Godzilla' film. The dialog is equally awful. On Godzilla approaching Hawaii to intercept the generic MUTO a Navy crewman on a carrier reports ""Object incoming from the Pacific."" Most people should realize that the Hawaiian Islands are surrounded by the Pacific... This film is chock full of this sort of thing. Due to the inability to write these writers had to construct ridiculous acts to fill the plot; such as putting nukes on a train for San Francisco when they could have been slung under helos. I really could go on and on, and then some, but you get the point. And the cherry on top? How about constant cuts away from the reason why we watched this film to begin with - Godzilla. These cuts are so frequent that it almost tricks, or rather convinces you, that they were watching their CGI budget. Or how about watching his real appearance through a TV in some kids living room from across the room.I'm literally dying to know how some of these people get paid to write for screen.Which brings me to my fears regarding Godzilla: King of Monsters... One of these two writing duds remained on board for it. Thankfully there some fresh minds in there with Dougherty, but looking at his writing history also has me in fear due to his involvement with superhero films and making three versions of the same horror movie.Godzilla 2014 - 2/10"

",0.0,0.9451,2019-05-13 00:00:00,9,"Godzilla (2014) is a great movie all around. I don't understand why this movie gets the hate it does, other than the obvious misleading advertising. But a 1/10? This movie has a great score, great cinematography, and great visual effects. Regardless of what you think of the actual movie, you have to give credit to the sound and visual departments. So why not a 10/10? Well, my only complaint with the movie is that they kill off Bryan Cranston. While I do think that Aaron Taylor-Johnson gets a lot more crap than he deserves for his performance, Bryan was just a much more interesting character and to kill him so early was very disappointing. The teasing isn't a problem with me, since when we do see the monsters they make it worth while and show us very cool shots. It does get a little aggravating by the end, but I understand why they did it. They nailed the Godzilla roar, and the 2 new creatures had very cool roars as well. I also like all of their designs, putting the 1998 Godzilla to shame with how cool and samurai like this new Godzilla is. You can really tell by the visuals that he is old, and is just doing what he needs to to get back to the ocean. This movie was a great forgiveness message to the disaster of 1998."

",0.6124,0.7678,2019-05-05 00:00:00,9,"I liked this one better than the 1998 version with Matthew Broderick, simply because it reverts to making Godzilla the ""good guy"" monster again and shows him battling the ""bad guy"" monsters in the vein of the classic Godzilla films. You might prefer the originals because the cheesy special effects were what made them fun (or because of nostalgia), but this was a good entry in the series. It starts off with a scientist having to shut the door to cut off a nuclear cloud at the expense of his family while investigating some strange ""goings-on"" in the Philipines. 15 years later, his son is in the Navy with a family of his own, and is called to Japan because his father has been arrested, and monsters are being investigated. Of course one of them is Godzilla. Nuclear explosions are to blame, they reach San Fransisco, and epic battles ensue as our hero's family is in danger.I think the monsters' battle scenes are a main highlight, and the vast majority of this film was well done. It could have used some character development, though. I still liked it a lot. You will love it!*** out of ****"

Those crappy Asylum films with ""B"" actors, laughable scripts and idiotic special effects which I adore for the cheese has been mistaken as good cinema. The science in this film is bad. Oh I don't mean typical Godzilla feature bad, but one with less than a fifth grade understanding of the world and life.First my science beefs: The beginning reactor scenario was inane. Reactors are in a containment. People do not venture into the containment when the reactor is at full power. I know we needed to kill some people off in the beginning, but there were far better ways.Second science beef (there are many, I will just hit a few): No organism can ""feed"" off of ionizing radiation. It seems odd that Godzilla tends to destroy his food sources. Also if an organism did live off of radiation, the bottom of the ocean is the worse place to be. Go to Denver.Is it only me that considers that flying Rodan thingy always a victim. Heck, we even gave Darth Vader a break.The acting was bad. Bryan Cranston bobs around like a turd in a punch bowl. Serious? Bryan Cranston is all they could afford? Dig up Raymond Burr and prop him up like ""Weekend at Bernie's."" Aaron Johnson (Kick-Ass) really didn't make it either.Now if seeing Godzilla scares you, you are in luck as he mostly comes out at night and not that often.Remember the 1998 film in surround sound? The rain was coming down. You could hear the footsteps of Godzilla approaching as the fear and tension vibrated through the speakers.This film was a let down. X-Men time travel thing was better.7 stars on the MST scale."

And I'm glad I did, as I was really impressed.I was so grateful the film didn't have any annoying comic relief characters or annoying arrogant characters, which is very unusual for Hollywood blockbuster films. This was serious all the way, and was refreshing for this genre. In fact, I really enjoyed and rooted for all the characters. Bryan Cranston was excellent. Aaron Taylor-Johnson wasn't strong enough in the role of the hero, Ford, but he was very likable. Also, I think maybe the film was so much better because they didn't use any big shot Hollywood actors (think Dwayne Johnson) in the lead roles.The visual effects are very good. It's just a pity so much of the visuals were so dark - almost black and white, especially towards the end.

" Solid Godzilla Movie
",0.1531,0.9645,2019-03-20 00:00:00,9,"In the past pretty much all the films have had about Godzilla have had him as our enemy so it was nice to have a change for once. Aaron Taylor-Johnson who was cast as the lead role did a decent job and wasn't made to be a Prince Charming character and his wife played by Elizabeth Olsen wasn't made to be some princess waiting to be swept off of her feet as she was seen to be pretty much the same as everyone else of the support cast in terms of emotion. Ken Watanabe who was cast as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa again did a decent job of playing his role in the film but his assistant was incredibly over emotional at times in the film at times which it was not needed.When the action happened the cities it happened in the cities were pretty much destroyed (as you would expect) so you would see how powerful the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object) and Godzilla were, not to the point where you were on the edge of your seat not wanting to distracted but to be fair the CGI in the film of them fighting was pretty decent in total.Overall a solid Godzilla film with a nice change of direction of how Godzilla was made not to be the enemy but as an ally."

The monsters are awesome and teased at us very well and it kept my attention, but the acting from our main character Ford isn't that good. It didn't feel invested in my opinion. The scale of destruction is also very cool to look at. Especially such as the sequence of events in Hawaii. Some positives would be acting from Bryan Cranston (I don't know if I spelled his name right). You feel his pain and sorrow and I felt legitimately somewhat sorry for him. He really acted good. Elizabeth Olsen is passable. Ken Watanabe is passable. The cinematography really shows off the size of the monsters, besides that, it's passable as well.

" Fun if Flawed Hollywood Take on the Japanese Icon
",0.5106,0.9964,2019-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Being a huge fan of Godzilla movies, I was highly anticipating the release of Gareth Edwards' 2014 American Legendary Films reimagining. I'd heard that Toho was involved more with the production, I thought Edwards' Monsters (2010) was an intriguing take on a giant monster movie, and Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame was in it, promising strong performances and drama to support the monster action. Leaning back in my theater chair with a tub of popcorn, a big smile on my face, and surrounded by friends, I was so ready for this to be amazing. Unfortunately, I left the theater feeling a bit underwhelmed, and a friend's constant complaining about every possible nitpick tarnished my experience even further. Forward to 2019, when I finally decided I wanted to revisit it, feeling hyped again for the sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, coming out in May this year. Got the Blu Ray to add to my growing Godzilla collection-I've got most of them, though there are so many! It's loaded with extras that I'll have to get to at some point before May.My appreciation for it has slightly increased, and I think it's enjoyable as a ""dumb action/sci-fi movie,"" which is what most of the Godzilla films are, aside from the 1954 original and a few later gems like Godzilla vs. Mothra (1964) and Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant All-Out Monsters Attack (2001), which actually have good acting, human storylines, and capture some of the social heft of the original. So it's a bit unfair to judge this movie for what it isn't, though it's hard to judge the film on its own terms since it seemed like it was trying to meld suspenseful/fun creature rampage flick with a serious human survival/family action/melodrama story.The strongest aspect is how the monsters are handled. Despite the short amount of screentime Godzilla gets, the restraint does build up anticipation for the reveals. And the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) do get shown off a lot destroying stuff early on. The first half hour does a solid job of setting up the threat, so we understand how dangerous they are when they start wreaking havoc. Their appearance is sinister and unique; describing them as ""insect-like"" is probably the easiest comparison. Godzilla thankfully looks akin to the original Toho designs, a lumbering, spiky giant rather than the sleek giant iguana of the 1999 Tri-Star incarnation. There's great carnage action of city destruction and monster fights with the MUTOs, and the news footage of the monsters' conflict played casually on television sets adds a bit of campy levity to an otherwise too-serious tone. Finally, there's that one scene of Godzilla using his radioactive beam in an ""oh yes!"" moment that every decent Godzilla movie has.As for the mix of monster and human stories, the problem is that these elements are uneven, the human drama pushed to the forefront, focusing on Cranston's character, Joe Brodie (an engineer at a nuclear power plant) and later his son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), an army bomb disposal expert. This isn't inherently bad, as I thought it was what made Monsters unique, leaving me with the impression of a giant monster movie ""elevated"" to dramatic heights. What's unfulfilling is that it lacks emotional weight, suspense, or originality. We spend so much time with Ford yet learn little about or see little emotion from him (it's hard to decide whether this is due to Taylor-Johnson's limitations or the writing or a combination). And a soldier, we are meant to see him as a kind of military hero, and also as a loving family man, searching for his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son (Carson Bolde). It's all a bit clichÃ©.The role of MONARCH, the secret government agency studying giant creatures, which also plays a role in Kong: Skull Island (2017) and will feature in the next installments in the Legendary ""Monsterverse,"" adds a bit of intrigue, with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) a clear nod to director Ishiro Honda (who helmed the original as well as several sequels) and the tragic Dr. Serizawa from the first film, and Dr. Vivenne Graham (Sally Hawkins, now famous as the protagonist of The Shape of Water). While neither have much to do during the film, they are strong actors who bring a presence and a gravitas to the situation-understanding that all they can really do is study the monsters, because the military is not equipped to defeat them.Definitely worth a watch for even a casual kaiju (giant monster) fan, as long as you have tempered expectations. Despite its flaws, it's entertaining enough as a set up the Monsterverse and to see Hollywood put forward a more respectful take on Godzilla than the 1999 movie. While the Tri-Star Godzilla, I would argue, is actually not a bad giant monster movie, it fails miserably as a Godzilla movie, with few similarities to the Japanese franchise and the military winning the day. Legendary's take resembles the original series in that humans are struggling for survival rather than triumphing over creatures who are clearly beyond human power to control. Kong: Skull Island was more fun than this film in terms of campiness and more monster action, and the trailers for Godzilla: King of the Monsters look amazing, so I am exciting for the future of this franchise."

In cinema everything is bigger, louder and gives more chills.
In home if you dont have a home theater system and turn up the volume, you wouldnt still get that exact feeling, its just made for cinema watching.Story is good, specially i like how Ford Brody moves around in the movie, how he isnt lingering in one place, he has a goal, but he does everything that it takes to reach that goal.CGI is on point with the sound effects, hearing how the Godzilla charges up to shoot out the flames, just gives you the chills...

" Overrated!
",0.0,0.9985,2019-02-10 00:00:00,5,"Godzilla 2014 is a big disappointment for me. The film is a decent movie but, in my opinion, not a good Godzilla movie and just a lackluster film in general. There is barely any Godzilla in the film and instead focuses mostly on the human point-of-view. That is not necessarily a bad approach except that the human characters are not that interesting. When we see Godzilla and the other monsters wreak havoc it is awesome and there is some good action and great effects. However, when we finally see Godzilla wreak havoc and fighting the other creatures it is short-lived until the very end. Plus, the film is very padded out.The film is not god-awful. There are a lot of things that the film does very well. The effects are amazing. This is probably the best looking Godzilla movie so far. The movie, especially at the end fight has a very grand and epic feel to it. Everything just feels so huge and when the action scenes happen they are epic from the great effects, to the action, to the great set pieces. This must be an amazing film to see in 3D. I did not see it in 3D though.I also really like the design of Godzilla as well as the other monsters. Of all the films I have seen I think this one has my favorite design of Godzilla. Fans of the original Godzilla from Japan will be happy to know that this film stays true to the original film and lore right down to Godzilla's look. A good chunk of the film also takes place in Japan. For me personally, I do not care about that as much.Unlike most people I was introduced to Godzilla through the 1998 film and grew up on that, so I will always like and look to that movie first. I know I am in the minority but I enjoy the 1998 Godzilla movie. Honestly, I even like that film more than this film. I am not asking for anyone to agree but that's how I feel. I like the characters more, I like the action scenes more (though they did not feel as epic), and I like that Godzilla was used much more. The film felt a lot more like a Godzilla movie because he was in it much more and felt like a more realized character. I actually felt for Godzilla in the 1998 film, while in this one it was hard to get invested in Godzilla because we do not see him enough.One of the big issues I have with the film is that we barely see any Godzilla. The most we see of him is his spikes sticking out of the water. We do not see Godzilla in his full glory until near the end. We see the other monsters more and even then not much. When Godzilla or the other creatures wreck a city when he is fighting the other creatures we only see a little bit of it then it cuts away and then you see the end result until the end fight, which bugged me. When we see the monsters wreaking havoc it looks amazing, so I wish I could have seen more of it. When the trailers hinted that other monsters besides Godzilla would be in the film I was expecting something along the lines of Pacific Rim with lots of monster action, but that is not what we get. I do not want to hear people say: ""A movie with lots of monster action is not realistic."" This is a movie that has giant monsters. What is realistic about that? What I like about the 1998 film is that they have fun with the monster.The entire film is from the perspective of the humans which is not always bad but it is in this case. The human characters are not interesting enough to keep me invested for the entire film. The characters in the 1998 film, whether you like them or not, have more personality and are more memorable than the people in this. The only interesting character in the film is Brian Cranston's character. When he was there I was more invested and I thought he was going to be the lead considering he was marketed as the main character in the trailers. However he is killed off halfway through the film and the lead role shifts to his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and there is nothing to this guy. He is not interesting and has only one expression on his face throughout the entire film. He just looks very bored even when everything is coming down around him. The other characters are extremely forgettable, if you can even call them characters. The only other somewhat decent character is Dr. Ishiro played by Ken Watanabe. However, most of his screen time consists of him standing around not doing anything so it does not matter.Overall, Godzilla 2014 is sadly an underwhelming movie in my opinion. It can be considered a good or even great movie to fans of the original Godzilla. For me it was a disappointment. There are things the film does well or even amazingly well. I guess I was expecting a somewhat different film then what we got. You don't have to think that way though. I think many people will enjoy the film. Many people who have seen it did enjoy it."
" Not a monster-action movie, great as a monster thriller
",-0.4393,0.8176,2019-01-31 00:00:00,5,"Godzilla was an excellent Godzilla movie that was marketed extremely poorly. Classic Godzilla films all have an hour or more of buildup and anticipation for the massive monster that is about to appear, followed by 30 minutes or less of epic monster battles.Godzilla (2014) was able to capture that feel and anticipation perfectly, updated for the modern film industry, and should be remembered as one of the best Godzilla movies. However, the movie was marketed as if it were filled with scenes of either Cranston or Godzilla, both of whom are actually in the movie for 20 minutes or less. That coupled with the fact that everyone was still high on Pacific Rim served to be a disaster for Godzilla (2014) because the majority of the audience was expecting to see an extremely different type of movie.With that said, the acting was unremarkable and the classic style of Godzilla films can seem boring for modern audiences or out of place beside modern films."

" The Poster Doesn't Lie!
",0.0,0.961,2018-12-15 00:00:00,4,"I have to preface this review by fessing up that I've never really been a Godzilla fan, though I don't mind occasionally watching out of curiosity some of the 50's Japanese incarnations of the big guy.What I really don't get about this movie though is that it had a $160 million budget and yet we don't really get to see much of the big set action pieces, because they're all set at night and happen in near darkness. Have a look at the Godzilla poster. That'll give you an idea of what to expect. If your idea of fun is peering into a dark screen and imagining you can make out what is happening with the monster mash occurring, then you'll probably love it. I couldn't help myself from glancing at my watch.BTW there are some human characters. It's almost fraud to say the movie features Juliette Binoche. She is criminally underused and only has a brief few scenes and in most of those she wears a radiation protection suit. Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen play the perfunctory happily married couple with a cute kid, who are separated by the unfolding narrative and spend much of the remainder of the movie trying to reunite, in between dodging crashing skyscrapers. In truth they had far better back stories and stronger chemistry playing the sibling super heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Ken Watanabe is on hand as a token Japanese character who has a perpetual worried look on his face.In case anyone was wondering, for the umpteenth time in an SF film the Golden Gate Bridge cops a flogging again. And the odd tsunami (which has become THE go-to disaster vehicle of the 2010's) pops up to add extra havoc to the general goings on.It's pretty obvious I was unimpressed with Godzilla. But I have to admit the big guy still has his rabid following around the world, especially in the Asian markets, which helped the film make a marginal profit.All I can say, is that these audiences are very easily satisfied by a very ordinary film."
" Finally the Real Godzilla!
",0.0,0.9507,2018-12-11 00:00:00,7,"After the awful Emmerich's Godzilla of 1998, I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but indeed I had to change my mind. This movie of course isn't a masterpiece, but has the merit of extablishing a good tone for the sequels, and FINALLY presenting us Godzilla for what he really is. Godzilla is not evil, nor good, hes simply a force of nature. In the 98's movie, I felt really bad, Godzilla was depicted as a poor creature who get's killed by the humans, indeed I had the feeling that humans in that movie were the real evil, suppressing an animal who only tried to survive. I felt really sorry, it was like destroing a legend. This time however, is finally showed the real Godzilla, not good, not evil, simply above human perception of existence. Of course, in this movie there are some bad things too, some inconsistencies and contraddictions, some things seems conveniently too simple, like the main character living with his family in the very same place where in the end the action take place and where the monsters arrives from across the globe... But, whatever.. In the end I think this movie has more good things than bad, a great photograpy, a good script and a evocative soundtrack.."
" Return of the King
",0.0,0.9942,2018-12-09 00:00:00,9,"Ive long been a Godzilla fan, Ive seen almost every movie and the original one from 1954 still hails as a classic in my opinion and while there was some things that could have been done better in this movie, I still feel like this movie was/is one of the best movies of 2014 and marked a successful return for the King to America. Yeah, some could say that holding Godzilla back until roughly an hour in was sort of a letdown as well as killing off Brian Cranston(the only actor who seemed to give a **** the entire film) but this film mostly suffered from what I felt like was under-developed characters and over-all a somewhat too ""human centered"" movie. Taylor-Johnson is passable and Olsen is also enjoyable but other than Cranston, Hawkins, Strathairn and Watanabe the movie could have benefited from a better lead actor who could take command of the screen while not feeling like such an emotionless rock someone like Chris Pratt, Matt Damon (doubt he would do it) or even a Tom Hardy would have been much better suited for the role than Aaron Johnson. Yes, showing the human side of Godzilla's path of destruction is a much needed quality to these movies but not to the extent of giving your title character around 24 minutes of TOTAL screen time(+small appearances in the beginning) which is why I didn't have an issue with it. But on the flip side, most of the movie showed the humans being stupid and trying to nuke Godzilla(who feeds off nuclear fallout) and the MUTOs, the entire human aspect of the film could have been done alot better then the simple ""lets nuke em"" approach. The fight scene towards the end really made the movie for me as a whole and the final appearance by Godzilla was glorious as well. All in all, I feel like this movie was very well done. Say what you want about Godzilla's screen time but you can definitely feel his presence being felt as they cleverly took a page out of classic movies like ""Jaws,"" and ""Jurassic Park"" at holding their biggest and baddest monster back, allowing you to feel his presence off screen before unleashing him onscreen."

Come 1999 I was so excited to hear of a new Godzilla movie! However it flopped majorly. Then comes this adaptation which stuck to original source material. Now to prevent confusion I would like to point out the Godzilla in the 1999 movie is not Godzilla, it's just Zilla who is an enemy to Godzilla. Who is Godzilla? He's thought of oftenly has a God of destruction hence the God in ""Godzilla"". Godzilla hates humans, but when the situation calls for it, he will fight side by side with them and protect humanity. That is the Godzilla in this movie and he even comes equipped with his famous Atomic Breath. I get asked alot of questions from people and the most common question I get is "" is Godzilla good or bad"" the answer is simple! He's neither Good or bad as I explained above. He hates humans with a passion, but he will protect them from other threats. If you are wanting to watch this movie, it's important to remember what I have said about his character has it will make much more sense."
" Another in a series, the American Action Movie MessÂ®
",0.0,-0.9606,2018-08-14 00:00:00,5,"Started out promising, some great cinematography, but rapidly devolved into American Action Movie MessÂ®Way too broad in scope, so the origin story is buried, shuffled past, and just too much is happening. The Hero is absolutely generic, in looks, as written, and has no acting ability at all. At least when we're promised the movie is full of Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche and he acts alongside one of them for a while. It sticks out. Action scenes are poorly done, so it's often hard to tell what is going on. Or, things make no sense. Or, it's just so dark you cannot tell anything is happening at all. Despite, apparently, thousands dead, there is no sense of consequences. The peril is told, not felt, not really shown. Maybe that's all they could get with PG13, but in that case: make a different movie. HORRIBLE continuity and accuracy. Forget plausibility, we can go with alternative histories and stuff, but the same buildings are destroyed multiple times, ""EMPs"" work when needed for the plot instead of on all devices, a clone of SFO is in Hawaii, and Yucca Mountain is in the hills outside San Francisco, the bay is a mile deep, and much more that is distractingly stupid and awful."
" A Monster Movie that does it Right
",0.0,0.9591,2018-08-12 00:00:00,9,"After the disappointment of the '98 Godzilla, you'll naturally have doubts about a new American Godzilla movie. Cast those doubts aside. Godzilla (2014) handles all the monster movie tropes correctly and the result is a great addition to the lineage of the King of the Monsters.First, nobody's favorite part of a monster movie is watching the humans talk to each other. This movie is no exception, but the characters aren't annoying or nearly as forgettable as other monster movies' humans. Even after Bryan Cranston's character dies, the characters' story remains followable and interesting.As for the monsters themselves, their roles are handled perfectly. Throughout the film, the monsters' presence is shown very sparingly, giving the creatures the air of mystery that causes you to regard them as titans, not just big things that destroy stuff. They are very rarely shown in their entirety for whole shots until the finale, making their appearances all the more mystical and powerful.One thing I think is noteworthy is that the film features two monsters that are entirely new to the franchise. These monsters, M.U.T.O.s, are terrifying and interesting. Additionally, they serve as the antagonists, giving Godzilla the role of protector of earth; a role that the uninitiated may not know he frequents.All in all, Godzilla (2014) is everything you want in this kind of monster movie. This is a great introduction to the franchise as well as a respectable American adaptation for long time fans."

Unfortunately the story line for the humans was horrible. What army blocks a bridge so school buses can't escape? Also why would they send school buses across the golden gate to get out of the city? It seems like they put people in peril only to fill the monster moments. I really wanted to like this but the only fun I had was yelling at the screen at the disastrous plot points. A real failure that could have been so good to the godzilla traditions.

That's how it goes in almost all of the Japanese movies and no one ever complains about that, so they're just being biased...and they won't admit it.

" Not much Godzilla for your money
",0.0,0.3312,2018-03-24 00:00:00,3,"Visually this version of Godzilla is pretty impressive. And most of the last 25 minutes or so are quite cool. There, that's all I can see that the movie has going for it. Hollywood took 18 years to try again and remake the Japanese classic. Let me say they are still struggling.It's as if studios were criticized once too often that blockbusters lack characters so now they cram sad excuses for characters into every movie and forget what it was supposed to be about. Think of Transformers which fed viewers the personal life of Sam Witwicky instead of fighting robots (or their characters). Think of Iron Man 3 which was about the personal struggles of Tony Stark instead of, well, Iron Man. This Godzilla is about an American soldier and bomb expert and his relationship with his beautiful wife and little son who miss him a lot because he's away a lot. It's also about his relationship with his father who went a bit cooky after loosing his wife. The movie is also about the US military who are mainly there to look cool and fail heroically. It's furthermore about the Japanese scientist who has been studying Godzilla, has some unexplained motivation and is mainly there to look concerned. Do you realize which character I've been leaving out so far? Yes, it is, of course, Godzilla, the literal father of all ""dai kaiju"". I am sorry to report that he doesn't appear very much in what's supposed to be his own movie. In fact, you could probably skip to the 90 minute mark and not miss much of him. There is a new kaiju, which vaguely reminds me of Mothra, and it seems to get more screen time than Godzilla.Another reviewer compares this to old horror films, like Jaws, that (driven also by technical limitations of the time) would tease the viewer with glimpses of the monster until the climatic reveal. I disagree. In Jaws you would not see the shark but it would always make its presence felt - it would kill people. Actually, think of Cloverfield as a kaiju movie in which, I think, both the focus on the people and the monster-teasing worked pretty well. You get some backstory of the characters but from then on the monster's presence drives everything they do.I'd recommend Shin Gojira instead of this one."
" Ho hum
",0.0,-0.9528,2018-03-22 00:00:00,3,"Hard to believe that a Godzilla movie could be dull, but this is dull. 
The production team makes the mistake of modern movie making. They try to confuse the audience with a bunch of special effects that make you feel the headache of an annoying arcade or a goofy casino full of those annoying lights flashing over and over.
Pretty much everything is contrived for the sake of what little the writer and director have in mind. We never feel we're there. We only feel we're in the presence of people making a movie, and that's a poor sign.
If you can stay awake for the first two hundred years of this movie (it will seem like two hundred years), you'll finally see a monster. 
The biggest problem is we just get the same characters over and over. Hollywood thinks all men have to be married with families, or they're worthless garbage. Again and again, we are alienated by Hollywood ""superiority"" complexes.
Not pathetic, but this movie is tedious and annoying."

You would see a few of the same ones at random movie rental places, but some were never to be found anywhere. I remember finally finding some mail order place that had them all, and I would save up and order a new one every time I had enough money. The first US Godzilla wasn't Godzilla. I enjoyed it at the time, I think I was 14, but it just wasn't Godzilla!I had been waiting for years to see the real Godzilla in modern special effects on the big screen, with a gritty story to match the original movie. I think this hit the mark. I hear so many people complain that Godzilla wasn't plastered on the screen the entire movie. The way they minimally showed him really worked for me. The only time it bothered me is when they cut away during one fight with the MUTO. The CGI, audio, size, and character of this Godzilla made such an impact when he was on screen, I didn't notice his lack of screen time. I really liked the story, I liked the MUTO's, I loved the backstory of Godzilla with the nuke ""testing"". It wasn't perfect. I would say a strong B+. With how much I also enjoyed Kong: Skull Island, I am really excited for King of the Monsters, and eventually seeing a serious take on King Kong vs Godzilla.

Better acting, better plot and better characterization of Godzilla as we expected to see it. There is a problem though; as you see the movie you may see similarities to another movie, 'Cloverfield', and the reason, besides watching big monsters leveling a city, may be because of gimmicks that instead of 'giving personality' to the film, actually end up screwing it. In Cloverfield you get some guy unable to hold steady a camcorder with no image stabilization, and apparently the guy also has seizures and films the whole thing while trying to keep the equilibrium while juggling chainsaws with the other hand; there is no other explanation as to why they moved the camera so much that makes the spectator want kick both the director and the camera men in the teeth, as 'trying to give the impression of an amateur camera man' would not justify it. There is no problem with shaky images here; instead, somebody though that it would be a good idea to show a black screen and every once in a while show a silhouette or a border of something that you may recognize or not; sometimes you may even think that you are watching a shadow puppet show with some radio-drama on the background.

" A decent reboot attempt, but not good enough to have me anticipating any potential sequels
",-0.4782,0.8546,2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"Did I like the new 'Godzilla' film, the first in 16 years? I really wanted to, but while there's some good aspects, they're counterbalanced by plenty of bad things. First, the ""storyline"" - two MUTO (""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"")'s are awakened (why now?) and converge on San Francisco (why there?). Godzilla shows up to fight them (why?).It sounds like it could be a good version of 'Pacific Rim' - and while it's cool to see the giant CGI monsters, you don't actually get to see enough action/battle scenes. The major failing is the characters - you spend an hour with Taylor-Johnson & his Dad (Cranston) before you even see Godzilla! Despite that, there's still very little character development and you just plain don't care what happens to them or the other human characters. It definitely needed more of Watanabe. Also, there's a ridiculous number of coincidences how Taylor-Johnson/Kick-Ass keeps showing up in the right/wrong place.One of the major unexplained situations is where did Godzilla come from, and if they knew he existed, where has he been for 60 years? Hibernating on the ocean floor? And why does he want to battle the MUTO - for food? Apparently not! Therefore, what does he eat to sustain his giant bulk? The other major annoying thing for me was the stupidity of the humans - hey, these MUTO love nuclear energy, so let's try to destroy them with a nuclear weapon! Or they can emit electromagnetic pulses - let's keep flying planes & helicopters near them, surely they won't crash! Anyway, on a positive note, you do see some of Godzilla for the final 30min (but not enough) and he does, thankfully, have flame-breath."

I am a fan of Godzilla and will tend to give anything with Godzilla in it more leeway than it deserves, and even still, I have to say this was not a good movie. I don't know what the bug-things were, but I was hoping for a classic character to be the antagonist. Godzilla was not in the movie much, which is sad because he is the main draw. His scenes were all dark and from odd angles, making it harder to enjoy what little screen time he received. I expect this was a artistic decision, but I disagree with it. In a movie like Cloverfield it works, but in a movie named Godzilla where everyone wants to see Godzilla, it does not work as well. This movie gets 4 stars because Godzilla was in it, and I like to see Godzilla. One final point, which will likely render the rest of my review unreliable by... just about everyone. Bryan Cranston. There are people complaining that he did not get enough screen time, and they are correct, he is not the main focus. But my issue is... All I see is Malcolm's dad. I watched one season of Breaking Bad and stopped because it was so unrealistic for Malcolm's dad to be doing those things. Did no one else watch that show??? How is no one else having this problem???"

The Cinematography, visual atmospheric style and whole tone and vibe of the movie is intense, astonishing and very well executed. The visual effects are spectacular and dazzling. Spectacle 3D and motion captures effects are fantastic. The cinematic story telling style of the film is phenomenal, immersive and impressive. The suspenseful, tense and mysterious build up is mind blowing. The fight and action sequences are well paced and breathtaking. There are some very creative and innovative sequences that are really amazing to watch on screen. The structure of the film is well balanced with exciting visceral thrilling scenes which are highly imaginative, compelling and convincing. The depiction and mythology of Godzilla both as hero and a monster is gripping, extraordinary and very fascinating.The last few minutes of epic showdown is very interesting, absorbing, artistic, awe-inspiring and very beautifully filmed and shot. The movie illustrates the power of the King of Monsters and the film captures Godzilla in all of its glory. Every time Godzilla is on screen the movie develops into a non stop thrill ride. The movie immerses its audience into the adventures of Godzilla which oozes brilliance in every scene it appears. The film is a visual marvel and brilliant in its conception and execution. The movie also explores the oppositional forces other than Godzilla and captures the essence of fear and visual beauty. The movie breathes life into the characterization of Godzilla and enchants itself with every element. The film is an extraordinary testament in its portrayal of the cultural icon of Godzilla. The movie accomplishes the difficult task of genre based film making.The direction of Gareth Edwards is good especially in regards to visuals and creating Godzilla action sequences. The main and major issue with the film is the very less screen time of Godzilla. This is really a major disappointment, because there is very less Godzilla in the film and Godzilla itself does't get enough screen time in its own film. The Human characters of the film are dull, boring and very underdeveloped. There is no emotional depth and intensity. Another major issue with the film is another major character that is the character of Bryan Cranston, also has a very less screen time. But, its the last superb fifteen minutes of the film that delivers something totally awesome.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others.

",-0.3612,-0.7267,2017-08-13 00:00:00,3,"I'll come straight out and mention no way am i a Godzilla fan, i like the original 1954 film and it's first sequel in 1955 but then they just become more juvenile and stupid with appalling effects. I thought the 1998 American version was OK but no more than that. This is an awful, incomprehensible blockbuster movie that has monsters as unconvincing as the cheap Japanese films of the 1960's and 70's that inspired it.People blast the 1998 "" Godzilla"" but that is a far, far better film than this overblown travesty of a movie. No sense, no feeling, no nothing. very poor. i liked "" Kong: Skull Island"" very much and that leaves this standing."
" Godzilla 2014
",0.0,-0.8949,2017-08-02 00:00:00,1,"I found it hard to know what was going on in this film as the lighting is often dreadfully poor. We tried turning the lights off but found we were just in a dark room with lots of noise coming out of the TV.I like the Toho Godzilla films and I like Roland Emmerich's Godzilla too. I really do not like this Godzilla.First of all the monsters are all implausibly big. I get how fun is derived from giant monsters, but not only do these monsters have their heads in the clouds, the tone of the film is incredibly serious. I felt like I was watching Cloverfield a lot of the time. Seriousness and skyscraper-sized monsters don't go well together.Dialogue is poor, characterisation is tired and off the hook, poorly designed and executed monsters all round, witless, dead-serious, and with no character whatsoever, this is not a film for me.What it has done is provoke me into buying earlier Toho Godzilla films to be watched on my Region 1 player. There are some great ones to check out if you haven't already, such asGodzilla vs The Smog Monster, Son of Godzilla (BRILLIANT MONSTER EFFECTS!!!), Godzilla vs Gigan; Ebirah, Horror of the Deep; Return of Godzilla etc.I feel like they got me out of the coma Godzilla 2014 put me under.Also I would like to know why the film was met with rave reviews from critics? It has been treated as an art film that explores the non-exhaustive facets of society. Is this because the original Godzilla was about nuclear weapons and how terrible they are? So therefore this film must have some serious message to get across?It doesn't. If anything it seems to be for everything the original film was against.I'm tired of darkly-lit, implausible, thick-headed, dim-witted, CGI-ridden, factory-produced let-downs like this. Let it be forgotten about in time. Bryan Cranston has moved on so the rest of us should too."
" Disappointing on so many levels...
",-0.4939,-0.067,2017-07-01 00:00:00,3,"The 98 version had a soul, this outing does not...the 98 version combined some not so subtle humor with a story line that you could follow, this one does not...The producers apparently wanted to go back to the 60's and 70's to recapture the Japanese roots of Godzilla procuctions, introducing giant and bizarre insect looking creatures as an adversary, which Godzilla promptly chooses to pop in to save the humans...typical Japanese characterization where Godzilla becomes the good guy...The 70's productions were campy and ridiculous, but grew a cult following. But this is 40 years later, with a hugely different viewing audience. I do not believe this franchise will go very far..."
" Lifeless and Dull as Dinosaur Bones
",-0.4019,0.6124,2017-06-11 00:00:00,2,"There are three movies I've seen in my life that I've fallen asleep during in theaters, Taken 2, Mortdecai and Godzilla (2014). I've watched this droning doldrum of a giant monster movie three times, I have not once been able to stay awake the entire day, early morning, late night, or mid-day, this is the cinematic equivalent of Xanax. The main character of Kick-Ass fame might as well have been called Guy Personson, he was possibly the most bland thing that has ever been put to film, blander than the Sahara desert, blander than a sparkling infomercial bath tub, the character could have been played by a twig in the wind and the film would have been better for it but for some reason he's 99% of the movie called GODZILLA. This gets 2 stars for all two minutes that the titular character was on screen."
" review
",0.0,0.9841,2017-05-13 00:00:00,9,Fantastic! Godzilla is back in this explosive action packed thrill ride of a monster movie. I really enjoyed and my friends enjoyed it too. The acting from the cast is good. The visual effects are awesome. The Godzilla creature in the film looked amazing. It had a satisfying ending.
" Mother Nature cares, but never take her for Granted!
",0.5848,0.8921,2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"A monster is created. How does that happen? Nuclear traces falling on some creature making it stronger by being its food.Is there need to worry? The answer is maybe not. Mother Nature takes care of everything.But one should notice not to take Mother Nature for granted. For she may require the time, that would happen to be enough to wipe entire human race.This is one such movie where Godzilla is shown as positive entity.Awesome movie! Highly recommended."
" Nice blend of Japanese and American setting
",0.4215,0.6908,2017-04-19 00:00:00,6,"With his first feature film ""Monsters"" (2010), director Gareth Edwards showed a level of ingenuity and creativity that reached far beyond the Hollywood standards. His next project, Godzilla (2014), gave him a budget of $ 160 million. Hollywood had tried before to make its own version of the classic gigantic Japanese movie monster, but failed. Thankfully, Edwards does a lot better than Roland Emmerich did in 1998, creating a Gojira that the audience can care for, becoming the saviour of humanity rather than just a destructive force."
" A very smart, tense movie that builds anticipation very well!
",0.5267,0.9758,2017-04-06 00:00:00,7,"People tend to hate on this movie due to the lack of Godzilla, and I myself also wish there was more of the big guy. However, if you can learn to except this movie for what it is, you will be pleasantly surprised. The build-up and anticipation in this film is some of the best I have ever seen in any movie ever, period. The cinematography is extremely good, particularly when the camera is being shown from the humans perspective, as this shows just how huge the monsters really are. Bryan Cranston in this movie is fantastic, too bad he's only in it for the first 40 minutes. And the final battle between Godzilla and the M.U.T.O's brought back fond childhood memories.In short, if you are going into this movie expecting a typical monster movie where the monster destroys everything for the entirety of the movie, expect to be disappointed. However, if, like me, you love movies that create a great sense of anticipation and world building, you'll love this movie, regardless of whether you are a Godzilla fan or not."
" Very Solid Godzilla Movie
",0.2247,0.9838,2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,"I appreciated this movie greatly mostly for the fact that it follows more along the lines of the 1954 classic. It's a much darker Godzilla story then what has been shown in the previous 1960-1990's Godzilla movies. I will agree that Godzilla was shown for not much time and they definitely should have found a way for him to come in earlier. There were also a few scenes that didn't happen that definitely should have happened. I think we all know what scenes they are *cough cough* airport *cough*. There were some things I was disappointed in, but it did so much right for Godzilla. Every bit of Godzilla you see in this movie is the real Godzilla. He is back and ready as ever to kick monster ass. He is NOTHING like 1998's travesty of a monster. The MUTO's were also very well designed and interesting monsters. The fight scenes are excellent and well choreographed. Overall I thought it was a great Godzilla movie with a lot of homage to the original 1954 Gojira. It was also a great way to set up the monster universe. I'm very excited for the upcoming movies and really hope that they don't pull a lot of these mistakes a second time. It works effectively this time, but a second movie like this would kill it."
" Good grief...
",0.4404,0.7335,2017-03-19 00:00:00,2,"I like sci-fi, and enjoy suspending reality for a couple hours. Having said that, there still needs to be a modicum of believability in a film. Either those responsible for this film are totally clueless, or more likely just didn't give a rip. I will not bother listing all the issues in the movie, just see the goofs section. There were a couple of things that jumped out at me repeatedly though. 1) for some reason, the main character (a navy lieutenant), wasn't required to be at work or report in (I suppose maybe he was on leave). At any rate, he must've been quite the lieutenant as he was able to just join up with whatever military unit he happened to come across in his travels. 2) apparently the special effects folks struggle with the concepts of scale and distance...constantly. I truly hate to think it was decided that the movie-going public would be so overwhelmed by the awesome special effects that they wouldn't notice all the plot holes and poor research, but that's kind of what we have to assume."
" Godawful.
",0.0,0.7227,2017-03-18 00:00:00,3,"Godzilla (Gojira) wakes from his slumber to do battle with two over-sized insect-like monsters that have been causing trouble in Japan, and which are now headed for San Francisco.I think it's safe to say that I am in the minority for liking Roland Emmerich's Godzilla (1998), but dammit, I find it entertaining despite all of its silliness. In contrast, Gareth Edward's Godzilla is one hell of a bore for most of its running time, with way to much of the two hours plus spent on dull drama, and the action scenes, when they happen, simply too dark to be enjoyable. This is probably the reason why this year's Kong: Skull Island was so devoid of a plot, comprising of endless action set-pieces occurring in broad daylight: the makers were trying extra hard to ensure that it came nowhere near to the abject dreariness of Edward's film.When giant radioactive lizard and mighty ape finally meet up in Godzilla vs. Kong (scheduled for 2020), I sure hope that they take extra special care to get the balance of plot and action right: I don't think I can handle another monster-sized disappointment."
" This film pits Godzilla against malevolent creatures who, bolstered by humanity's scientific arrogance, threaten our very existence.
",-0.7184,0.9979,2017-03-10 00:00:00,8,"Gareth Edward's version of ""Godzilla"" is an honorable monster- invasion film of all sorts. It is very different from Tristar's 1998 film of the same title where its monster loves to eat fish and wreaks havoc out of pointlessness which is so cheesy and laughable in a very bad way. Edward's version has a more tolerable reasoning. And it was improved even more by its impressive cinematography, wise and humble usage of special effects and the CGI creation of Godzilla, which looks almost completely faithful to the 1954 original.I am somehow enjoying the form of this film. The action is bigger when it involves humans. As much as possible, when the monsters fight, it limits itself to be action-packed by setting the camera work in the human perspective and sometimes at an even more distant range. It's not that the monster action isn't happening. It's definitely there and special effects are used but its style tries to make its audience be a part of the scene and also to tranquilize its nature to succumb in clichÃ©d action sequences.I actually prefer it that way. Comparing this to last year's ""Pacific Rim,"" ""Godzilla"" is definitely more exciting. Why? Because ""Pacific Rim"" is fully drowned in monster mayhem and uproarious action so mindless it will make you yawn or scratch your heads. It gives a very detached, easily weary effect (although its other elements like its human drama and stunning visuals made it irresistible). In ""Godzilla"" however, the lesser focus or up-close look on the monster action gives more immense anticipation whether it happens or not.The movie is also impressive on not showing its monster feature so easily. Patience definitely builds excitement as in Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws."" It slowly introduces Godzilla, starting with the body parts first in creeping silence. But when it finally show Godzilla's full image and roars so mightily, the scene easily becomes iconic. That was such an epic entrance. And it doesn't end there. It is filled with so many remarkable images of Godzilla. The wide shots of this monster are considered the best as it shows its entire scale while enamored by the subtle palette of its canvas.Godzilla is the main star of this picture although it has less of him. He roars so great and his fiery breath dominates the film with inexplicable power. Honestly, I think no one could have it the other way around.To generalize it all, ""Godzilla"" is an epic monster-invasion picture that triumphs greatly because of valuing its CGI and special effects by utilizing it more in achieving an artistic statement and immersive quality than just exhibiting heavy cataclysmic action. It effects are into impressive visuals that emits beautiful imagery and the cinematography anchored it with competence.Recreating Godzilla in a rare, perfect form is definitely something. But without having an idea on picking elements to collaborate it with,it would be almost like burying this iconic monster into the deepest trench of the ocean. I'm glad that this version has met some wise decisions. It wasn't for everyone but at least it shows utmost respect."
" Great revisioning of classic Godzilla
",0.6249,0.717,2017-03-07 00:00:00,9,"An admission: I love Godzilla films (and kaiju eiga in general), so my starting point with any Godzilla film is 'great' (Godzilla's Revenge being a sad exception). This one, the 30th Godzilla film (countijng Japanese and US versions) is extra-great. The plot is typical late-Showa ""Godzilla as hero"" era: evil monsters appear, puny men cannot stop them, Godzilla appears, things look dire as he struggles to defeat the new monster, he prevails, and he heads back out to sea. This film explains this behaviour as Godzilla being some kind of balancing force of nature (OK - he's been that before, as well as having been the spirit of Japanese war dead, or in simpler times, just a nice-guy monster). Wisely, the film cuts back on the actual monster wrestling scenes (always kind of goofy) and focuses on the collateral destruction (the Golden Gate Bridge gets trashed again - if you need to escape monsters or aliens in San Francisco, definitely take the Bay Bridge). There are a few plot holes (mostly around the monsters' plot-selective predilection for radiation sources). The incidentals (story- line, script, acting etc.) are fine but, as always are secondary to the main attraction, which is excellent. The big guy lighting up his radioactive breath is a highlight and, although I kinda miss the quaint 'suitmation' of the classics, the flexibility allowed by CGI shows in the evil monster design ('evil' being subjective in this context, mostly they were just some guy wanting to score and a girl looking to settle down and have some kids, mostly). Turn down the fore-brain, turn up the hind-brain, and enjoy."
" A review NOT from a hard core fan
",0.381,0.9683,2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"Being that most reviews here are negative and written by fans who want things to be done by the book, I feel like there are also different points of view from people who don't care about the original story and are just looking for entertainment.This Godzilla movie is not bad at all. I don't think any Godzilla movie is a masterpiece, far from that, but this 2014 is a good pop corn disaster colossal yelling monsters hard to put down with conventional weapon artillery. The monsters are well done, the buildings are as solid as tree leaves and crumble in slow motion as it should due to the inertia momentum of heavy materials and there are OK fights between Godzilla and his natural opponents. This 'another scale' fights could have been more dramatic and gory but we feel at all moments that the movie director wanted to preserve the most highrise buildings in the city so perhaps this is the reason why he shortened a little the fights. Plus, how would they manage to clean the streets if there were several artificial lakes of monster blood spilled all over the place. So keep it realistic. Still when Godzilla or some other nuclearily zoomed cockroach sneezes there is little in the way to save in matters of high-rise buildings glasses or some trendy penthouse terraces. Plus, these rather clumsy entities don't care much about keeping moving along the sidewalk like any educated 20th century individual so a certain level of collateral damages similar to those produced by a 9.5 magnitude degree earthquake is naturally to be expected.Finally, we can now easily blame the US army generals, and for a good reason. These guys joggle with nuclear heads like I do with two oranges (when I manage not to drop both of them on the floor). Seriously, trowing in the middle of the city some cracker capable of wiping an area covering several phone area codes then having a soldiers team going to rescue the ticking bomb? Why didn't they just put the toy in a UPS truck just passing by. But even then, Godzilla is still not far away from there, acting around and checking the situation with a more or less attentive eye. He's the real hero, and no, he doesn't drink Coca-Cola when the job is done, nor does he eat at perhaps the only remaining McDonald's in the city. He just takes a dip in the pool, sorry ocean, and swims away like any regular guy in a hot torrid Sunday afternoon. Minus the swimming gear."
" Let's shoot our pellet guns at those enormous beasts
",-0.34,0.356,2017-02-18 00:00:00,5,"If there is one thing for sure it's that Godzilla is a very impressive big lizard, and I'm only speaking about the creature then, because the movie is anything but impressive. There is so to say almost no plot or story. And it's way too long to stay concentrated for the entire movie. It's Godzilla that has to save the world from other creatures. The absurdity is when the humans start shooting their machine guns at the monsters. You could use a pellet gun it would be the same. Just put the thing on fire and job's done. About the cast, the only decent actors with a name die within the first twenty minutes. So for the acting you don't have to watch Godzilla. For the story neither. You could just watch if you like big creatures and that's about it."
" Don't waste your time
",0.3252,-0.9853,2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,I supposed the director thought it was highly stylish but this movie was infuriating to try and watch. Most of it was filmed in the dark using extreme close ups so there was NO idea of what the hell was going on. A train comes out of the silent dark in flames. How? Why? The beasts are battling. Now they're not. They're over here. Now they're over there. What the F##*? No narrative to help the viewer either. It was like trying to watch the film in the dark through a keyhole. Absolutely frustrating. Pure crap. The review requires 10 lines of text in order to be accepted. But ten lines is more than this movie deserves and certainly more than is needed to express how dreadfully boring and annoying it is. I'd rather watch any movie where you can actually see what's going on instead of some blurred dark images that passes for art in the mind of some self-centerd filmmaker.
" Why so Dark?
",0.0,0.4278,2017-01-31 00:00:00,4,"I'm always wary when 5 to 10 minutes into a film, the screen goes almost black, however, I thought I'd watch this film regardless of the bad reviews as I like a good monster flick and haven't seen one since the Japanese 'The Host' It would've been OK if it hadn't have been so dark. Why they cant set them during the day is beyond me. The Host was in daylight all the way through and never once did it spoil the atmosphere, in fact it did exactly the opposite. When are these film people gonna learn, folk are bored with peering at a gloomy screen for 2 hours. One of the best TV series ever, 'Breaking Bad' hardly had a dark scene in it so come on movie people, get your act together, any more DARK films and I'm out of there or if its on the TV it will be switched off."
" Entertaining reboot
",0.4404,0.813,2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"This was a decent enough creature feature and about what I expected. At least the special effects didn't completely overshadow the whole movie here and there was a pretty good story attached. On the downside all the characters are kinda flat and underdeveloped especially from Aaron Taylor-Johnson who is the main hero dude.Bryan Cranston might be the exception, but he (consciously?) overacts his role as Joe the grieving father/scientist/Godzilla conspiracy theorist. There is a decent back story set up for him though. Elizabeth Olsen is in the wife/mother role and this could have been done by anyone. Ken Watanabe also very flat, a grumpy sort of non character. They all take it seriously though, and this is an entertaining movie.The visuals are beautifully done and I enjoyed the story with Godzilla emerging from hibernation to battle winged creatures called Motos, threatening humanity. I also liked the new spin put on Godzilla where he is the good monster, helping to save civilization and bus loads of children from the evil, nuclear loving, ever mating Motos. Wasn't too sure about the spin put on history regarding Hiroshima etc -changing history- but decided to just let that go.Lots of mayhem and destruction, as cities are leveled (which is always fun to watch), some excellent battle scenes with colossal destruction from the creatures, lots of globe trotting through Japan (Vancouver), Hawaii, Las Vegas, and San Francisco. Mostly filmed in and around Vancouver through; Steveston, Victoria, Nanaimo, New West"
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.967,2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"Lots of noise no pay off. The story had promise, but it was disjointed and boring. The director substituted noise for action and his the creatures in dark disjointed scenes. To be honest the bad Godzilla movie starring Matthew Broderick was better than this poor attempt. They give you this rehashed footage at the start of the atop nuclear test that we see in all these movies. The movie introduces characters only to have them disappear from the story. The main human character is never made likable. And Godzilla is reduced to some overgrown dinosaur. We see his weak breath weapon have no effect on the bad creature. And the story jumps location so fast you have to believe the army has faster than light travel abilities. In a couple hours you go from Japan tho Hawaii to Las Vagas to San Francisco. Total waste of a great monster."
" Good acting skills but not great film
",-0.5409,0.9847,2017-01-20 00:00:00,6,"This Godzilla movie isn't the best. But, it isn't the worst. I am usually so hyped when blockbusters come out in cinemas and I am even more known to be one of the first to watch them but I can honestly say with a hand on my heart that you should NOT repeat NOT ever go to the cinema to watch this film. If it costs you nothing and you are at home just watching it because it's there than maybe. But do NOT waste any money buying a DVD or on AMAZON or anything like that because you will be a very angry Joe if you have to pay ANY money for this trash.The sound affects and the make up effects for GZ are good. They generally scared me at some points of the movie. But if i'm being honest that's the only thing going for the entire film. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's acting is quite good especially for the emotional parts of the movie and so is Cranston's acting but you can tell it's made up. The story line was just plain stupid. Blah, blah, blah three monsters, blah blah blah. You probably understand. The worst thing for me was that the film BASICALLY isn't even ABOUT GODZILLA. GZ only appears like half way to three quarters of the movie. It's more about the other creatures that appear in the first half. Now the ending isn't too bad, and I won't say too much for you folks that haven't seen this but it's just terrible. The normal happy ending blah blah blah. The film ends with GZ, and you can't even really tell whats going on. Also, the film doesn't even finish with a 'the end' nothing happens for like 3 seconds then BAM! with the dramatic music and credits then that's it.To conclude, unless you like wasting money or time, don't watch this film. And if you do end up watching this film, be prepared to be annoyed."
