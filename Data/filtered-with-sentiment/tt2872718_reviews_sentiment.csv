" Different Kind of Thriller
",0.1027,0.4005,2021-03-27 00:00:00,6,Very engaging story that will keep your attention. Unexpected ending to boot. Plenty of F bombs. Only objection is the typical Hollywood permissiveness to denigrate the Holy Name of Jesus so I've reduced rating due to that. They would never do that to their politically correct comrades.
" Better writing than 'Prisoners'

" Wow. Wow. Wow. WOW.
",0.9512,0.8259,2021-03-11 00:00:00,10,"It has been a long, LONG time since I've seen a movie which truly blew my mind. Then along came Nightcrawler.This is the perfect movie. Perfect. In every way. It's dark, sharp, witty, thrilling, intriguing. It's absolutely incredible that this is Dan Gilroy's directorial debut. The film has this uneasy, creeping feel to it, and Jake Gyllenhaal gives an absolutely incredible performance as what can only be described as a sociopath. It gives you a glimpse at the ugly side of the human condition, and has a storyline that is anything except predictable.There's a sort of darkly funny tone throughout the movie, and the entire thing will always keep you on your toes. The way that this movie is written will make it one you will not forget in a while. It's to the point. Nothing is sugarcoated. It shows the good, the bad, the ugly. It has all the elements of the perfect psychological thriller, and the way that the tension builds to the incredible climax is simply stunning.Highly recommend. It is the epitome of psych thriller movies, crime movies and the neo-noir genre.-Sasha"
" Final third is a letdown
",0.0,0.2263,2021-03-09 00:00:00,8,"The movie really enters the realm of impossibility in the final third, which is a shame. You can definitely feel the dip in quality , however that being said, one thing that remains excellent throughout is Gylenhal and his neurotic performance."

" Gyllenhaal at his best
",0.6369,0.8945,2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,"""Nightcrawler"" gives us one of Gyllenhaal's best performances of his career. He embraces the leading role brilliantly, giving the film a unique edge to it. It's an odd character to play, but Gyllenhaal surprises us with the near-perfect performance, adding so much more pizzazz to the interesting storyline."
" Great story, great acting, great movie, but.... I just didn't enjoy it.
",0.8927,0.5517,2021-02-08 00:00:00,7,"Gyllenhaal's acting was spot on in this movie. I've only seen one other film with him (Prisoner's) and I was blown away by how completely he adopts the roles. You don't think of him as Gyllenhaal, you think of him as Bloom or Loki.The movie in general was great as well. Interesting premise, successful execution, etc etc.But it just didn't set well with me. Maybe it's because it's so bleak and depressing, maybe because I felt like the movie didn't go anywhere. But I didn't come away from Nightcrawler with very many levels of positivity.Listen, I can handle sad, dark, and depressing films. But they also have to carry a purpose. This movie felt aimless.It's a movie many will enjoy, but it's not for me."
" Dark, thought provoking, fun
",0.3612,0.9158,2021-02-07 00:00:00,10,"Personally i don't think i have ever seen a movie that is part character study, part dark comedy, part media criticism, part action thriller. Besides being kinda unique in that way what i like most about it is its weird humour, which is so dark that i'm not even sure if it's always intentional. For me it's just fun to watch these total lunatics go down their empathy free, career obsessed rabbit hole. Gyllenhaal is absolutely brilliant. For me it's a dark comedy first and foremost and it's probably one of my favourite movies of the last 20 years."

I need a two-hour long movie to know that when metal bands in the 80's repeated that at nauseam, and said it in songs of four-five minutes? the only saving grace of this utter borefest is the lady in charge at the TV station, hence I give a three based on her being ultra-smokin' hot. Other than that, this is recommended only if you have finish your sleeping pills and you need something to go to the bed. It's a no from me."

The media?
Or us?The movie does present these issues (primarily the first 2) but they are overshadowed by the power of the 2 main characters, Gyllenhaal and Russo. So rather than focusing on the issues we tend to look at the monsterish behaviour of those characters, letting us and the industry off the hook.Its a cool movie with modern day actions, ethics and morals taken to extremes to present us with quite a wild ride.Thought provoking and entertaining, quite the winner!!"
" Louis Bloom made us remember the amazing Anton Chigurh from ""No Country for Old Men""
",0.3818,0.9328,2021-02-06 00:00:00,9,"First I would like to highlight Jake Gyllenhaal's spectacular performance. He played the role of ""discreet"" villain and ended up becoming more impactful to the audience if he had followed the exaggerated villain stereotype. He played the role of Louis Bloom, a sociopath who is a reflection of many of the media vultures around the world. First film I see in which he is the protagonist and I can't wait for more!
As for the film itself, I thought that the script was simple but very good. A film with relatively few characters which made it simple to watch, making it no less interesting for that reason. On the contrary, it is extremely well done, especially considering that it was the first film produced and written by this director.
Summing up and concluding, FANTASTIC FILM!"
" Way too unrealistic it's absurd
",0.0,-0.3071,2021-02-06 00:00:00,2,Story could have been interesting but the events are so absurd with the cops about as smart as 2nd graders. Worst Jake movie in his career
" Realistic, twisted, uncomfortable, tense
",-0.6124,0.5233,2021-02-04 00:00:00,7,"In Nightcrawler, you're following Lou who does freelance work by recording violent events during nighttime and selling the recordings to local television news. In the process of doing so he pushes the boundaries of legality because of his apparent psychopathic tendencies.
The film is great at building tension and making you feel uncomfortable as a result of the morally depraved actions depicted, which you get to witness first-hand through Lou's assistant.
Nightcrawler makes you feel like youre a passive accomplice in illegal activity and as though actually present, therefore making its single, - compared to contemporary spectacle driven movies - small-size and realistic action sequence feel incredibly real and full of emotional impact.
My only noteworthy gripe with it is that, in what seems to be an attempt to compensate for the small amount of action in the eyes of those whose attention cannot simply be kept by the great amount of tension, right around the climax, it resorts to including a romantic interlude and other details that do make sense as an extension of the protagonists psychopathy and the logical progression of the plot, yet feel contrived and unnecessary, making the movie seem like somewhat of a farce in the theatrical sense. It stands to reason that this was intentional and does not detract from the greatness of the movie too much, as it did still work, despite calling my attention to it's inner workings."
" How further you can push your boundaries to satisfy your personal and professional goals?
",0.4588,-0.1497,2021-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Louis Bloom, an unemployed guy that is up to everything in order to survive, even if this means to be unethical and despicable. The film immediately picture him committing minor thefts, but then he escalates quickly, becoming crazy and dangerous, when he discovers that he can make tons of money by filming real crime scenes, and building a career out of this. The more you watch him, the more you hate him.But this is not a movie just about a socially awkward sociopath, but also against the media manipulation, how news broadcast can twist facts and create a story from scratch, panicking people. In particular Nina, the KWLA director, has no morale at all and always pushes Louis one step forward, so she can obtain the latest scoop, to have bloodier and more graphic contents airing on the network. She just wants to save her career, and be the best on the field. These two are not only completely unprofessional, but also horrible human beings. The acting from Mr. Gyllenhaal is on point and managed to perfectly portray the descent into madness of the main character.The movie is very tense, and there a few scenes, especially in the middle and final sections, that kept me glued to the screen. The few action-packed sequences are very well directed and perfectly choregraphed. There are very explicit moments, but these are never all over the place, or unjustified. ""Nightcrawler"" is not scared to push boundaries and it takes quite a few risks, but it delivers. The result is an entertaining and intriguing movie that lasts two hours. It is not for everyone and if you are particularly sensitive to violence, this might be a hard one to watch, or even a pass. I highly recommend it and I wish that we can have more productions like this one."
" Interesting and Informative
",0.4019,0.9707,2021-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Not only is this movie entertaining, but it's a great informative look into the media business, and what happens when a psychopath gets involved. I like that it's subtle; they don't have to explicitly show things to get the message across. It's super dark, but still fun to watch."
" Nightcrawler- embodiment of the American dream
",0.25,0.985,2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,"Contrary to what you might have read elsewhere (in a lot of places) the film itself does not suggest Lou Bloom is a psychopath or sociopath or, indeed, exhibits any other mental condition or personality disorder. (Though, of course, he does exhibit certain narcissistic tendencies.) Lou comes with too much willingness to pursue violence to be termed a victim of society, but nevertheless he is what he is less because he was born that way and more because he was molded that way.The very first words out of Lou's mouth are quite telling:""I'm lost.""
In fact, at that particular moment in that particular place Lou is not lost at all. He knows exactly where he is. On a much grander scale, however, Lou is very much lost. This is obvious by the way he speaks. He doesn't speak like a regular human. Any time Lou has more than one sentence to say to something he slips into a cadence, rhythm and tone that sounds more like a motivational speaker or, even more so, like a guy in front of an audience force to sell himself because he knows the product he's trying to peddle is crap. But, they, America is all about the packaging, right? Because if you don't like what's beneath the wrapper, you can just throw it away and buy something else.Lou is lost because he has bought fully into the new America dream. Not the old one about finding a good job, buying a house, raising a family and not having to worry about class dictating the terms. The American dream Lou is pursuing is the bumper sticker dream. Lou is all about packaging. There is no core in there and everything he thinks is deep thinking sounds like something you'd see on a motivational poster or bumper sticker:""Do you know what fear stands for? False Evidence Appearing Real.A friend is a gift you give yourself.Why you pursue something is equally as important as what you pursue.Good things come to those who work their asses off.
My motto is if you want to win the lottery you've got to make money to buy a ticket.""That last one there is particularly insightful because Lou doesn't have a motto. If that's his motto, then you can bet he heard or read it somewhere else. (The one about friends being a gift, by the way, comes from Robert Louis Stevenson, but he meant it in a way completely opposite from how Lou exploits it.) What human being actually speaks like that on a daily basis in normal discourse with others? The answer is those who have taken the lessons the titans of American capitalism have been teaching them literally.Most of us know that kind of stuff is so vapid as to be meaningless and just laugh it off and go about living in the real world. But Lou caught on to something that rest of us haven't. The titans of American capitalism are vapid and they do it mean and, most important, they don't live in the real world. They live in a world where success is measured only by whether you have more money tomorrow than you did today. That's it, that's all. By that standard, Lou Bloom ends the movie as the embodiment of the American dream. By every other standard, not so much."

" Gyllenhaal carries a film that did not need carrying
",0.0,0.7314,2021-01-15 00:00:00,8,"This is the best of Jake Gyllenhaal in the 2010s, which is notable simply due to his impressive resume in that time frame. Lou Bloom is an apathetic, misanthropic sociopath and never once does the actor seep through the fast-talking hustler with the slimy, synthetic smirk. The performance carries a movie that did not necessarily need carrying. Nightcrawler is technically bullet-proof. The direction and cinematography are both magnificent and the portrayal of L.A.'s dark side is unforgettable.The performances surrounding Gyllenhaal are also fantastic, especially Rene Russo as the director of news footage. Riz Ahmed's Rick is realistic and gives the audience someone to pull for in a film dominated by unethical menaces.The problems with the film are mostly nitpicks. For example, the trope of ""cut brake lines"" from The Dukes of Hazard days rears its ugly head in this, a head that should have been decapitated decades ago. Anyone who has ever driven a car before would immediately feel an abnormal brake and for those first-time drivers, the dashboard would light up like a Christmas tree. Also, some suspension of disbelief is required. There is no way Lou would not be immediately arrested for interfering with police work several times throughout the film. Finally, the major flaw is the not-so-subtle message that is a bit stale at this point: the media exploits victims at whatever cost so long as the ratings are intact.That being said, Nightcrawler is a jaw-droppingly great debut from Dan Gilroy, who currently seems to be on the Rian Johnson trend of beginning at the apex. However, his first film is masterfully crafted and features a perfect performance Gyllenhaal. Lou Bloom is Travis Bickle-levels of disturbing weirdness."
" Nightcrawler review
",0.0,0.7184,2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,MacBethian levels of the battle between ambition and morality on display in this gripping thriller. Gyllenhaal is a powerhouse that demands full attention like the news reels he creates. The rich dialogue is as enthralling as the action sequences.
" A joy to watch.
",0.5859,0.9981,2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Jake Gyllenhaal is simply astounding, his performance in 'Nightcrawler' is one of the best performances by an actor I have ever scene he truly knocks this out of the park. The acting by every other character in this film is great but they are all completely overshadowed by the beauty of Gyllenhall's performance as Louis Bloom, a sociopath who films injuries, accidents and criminal events for the news. Set in La, which is an excellent setting for this film perfectly portrayed by the vision and direction of Dan Gilroy. This film is excellent at telling a story and it does this without relying solely on an end goal and the characters journey towards that which I thoroughly enjoyed seeing a great 'plotless' film, but. Towards the end the film became crime story. For me, this became a hindrance to the overall quality of the film it almost feels as if they ran out of ideas and turned it into an action movie. Here is where the similarities between ""Baby Driver"" come to fruition. Baby driver is another film similar to nightcrawler in the sense that it is a story about a characters life relying on acting, writing and direction to turn it into masterpiece this is true for both films for around 75% of the watch time. Until to watch the end of the films where it turns into a needless and sloppy action movie where where what was required instead was simply the characters and the relationship between them and the audience throughout the rest of the film whereas the ending for both of these films put a damper on on the the overall enjoyment to the film creating a sense of disengagement between the rest of the story and the ending both of these films which I loved but cannot appreciate it to the best it could have been as it is almost as if the filmmaking team threw the easiest way out of the story on at the end and hope that would be alright unfortunately this is not true for both in nightcrawler however, you'll see more of Louis' character and how he will do what is required for his own personal gain which does increase the character development of Louis and show is true nature right there for the audience to see. Overall I believe that this is an excellent film and would recommend to all."
" Superb by Jake Gyllenhaal
",0.6249,-0.6869,2020-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Jake Gyllenhaal has given an absolutely stunning performance- as creepy and disturbed hustler, a thief, a maniac.
The story is unique in its own way, however seems a bit unreal at times but nonetheless it's a thriller and doesn't get boring, although you can predict some of the things.
A decent watch if you're into crime thrillers."
" Genuine Classic - Nightcrawler
",0.0,0.9191,2020-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Before I viewed this film, I had severe reservations that it would be above a 5. I knew Jake Gyllenhaal was capable of great things; but it was also possible that his career might be in decline and this would the first film toward oblivion. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Although a bit slow in the first ten or fifteen minutes, the film, and more accurately, the character of Gyllenhaal pulls you in and does not let go for an hour and a half. A fascinating storyline which brought to mind Blow Up, and an intense character, that brought to mind Taxi Driver and Network, combine to make an unforgettable cinematic experience. A man who learns quickly morphs into a human monster. A film not to be missed."
" I don't really get the hype
",0.0,0.9686,2020-12-25 00:00:00,6,"I'm a psychological thriller junkie and this movie was common on lists I've come across of ""movies that will mess you up for weeks."" It seems to have good reviews but I don't really get the hype. It was entertaining enough to keep me watching, but that's about it.The ending scene in particularly really kind of aggravated me. The main character, Louis Bloom, is the sort-of creepy, but kind of lovable anti-hero that I would normally love and find myself rooting for despite all of the questionable things he'd done. The showdown with the cops in the end was rushed an anticlimactic. If they had extended that scene a bit to really show how manipulative and clever he is (like how he completely got away with attempted manslaughter earlier? Like, you mean to tell me that the cops didn't even attempt to look into why that guy ran his car into a pole?) that may have made it better."

" Not as good as people say
",-0.3412,0.1809,2020-12-13 00:00:00,4,"Probably one of the few that didn't like this film and didn't find this as appealing as everyone else. Here's why: Firstly Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Lou Bloom, portrayed as a freelance TV news cameraman with a nose for graphic tragedy, actually began as a weird petty thief. The problem here is there was no character background. The audience became manipulated. They were fooled into thinking this would be better than it actually was. It's mostly about fake news, a persuasive manipulative person getting into adrenaline junkie situations to make some quick cash then realises he could command more money and more respect. We are quickly thrown into a tense thriller.Lou goes around filming incidents he learned about on a police scanner. (It is not that simple believe me) and points a Black Friday value camera then sells this to a news company. Strange really if the character has been doing this for three months earning in excess of $1000 a night or whatever we never see him spending it or anything. There's just too much unbelievability with this movie.What was quite obvious to me and not to others was Jake himself slipping up so many times with his accent. At first he played a deluded, mental person let's be honest yet within a few minutes he's a fast thinking dreamer with an education. Not long after he's a rather posh accent, with manners almost English. Then not long after he's an American roaming around talking line he's a top businessman very prim and proper. Not much consistency. Yes he's a brilliant actor and really carried this film but I do not think through much of this movie that his performance was terrific or anything"
" Great story, believable study of TV news reportage
",0.6249,-0.8784,2020-12-04 00:00:00,9,"A grifter looking for a way to make money, becomes intrigued by TV news journalists filming a car accident on the freeway. Via a stolen bike which he trades for camera equipment he starts to compete with established crews for work.Jake Glyenhall plays a believable chancer who has an unwavering focus on his job coupled with a psychosis that becomes increasingly apparent across the course of the movie. Rene Russo's character is a Director of News for one of the many LA cable stations, unfortunately with low ratings. Glyenhall's character offers her the chance to redeem her journalistic credentials in the eyes of the Station bosses, by purchasing his footage. There is a very real moral dilemma presented here; 'What footage constitutes reportage versus voyeurism?'. Nevertheless, Russo's character sees through his veil, that he is not a 'latent' observer, with the ever more shocking footage he brings to her, making one of the closing scenes all the more curious...? If it weren't for that slightly discordant part of the script, this movie would have scored higher. Recommended."
" Satire more than thriller
",0.1725,0.9391,2020-11-29 00:00:00,7,"From the first scene in which we see protagonist Lou Bloom, we know what he is. He's an amoral liar and thief who doesn't bat an eyelid when cornered, or when he sees a thing he wants. His first go-to is violence. Within minutes we also know he's a bizarrely confident slick- talker, albeit with delusions of grandeur.
So what do you get if you cross a thug with a car salesman? A psychopath. And where better for a psychopath to find his niche than within the orbit of journalism as a collector of carnage video content for fee-for-service news programming?
This package of information is delivered deftly in the first act but the trajectory for Lou Bloom is well sign-posted which, for me, deprives Nightcrawler of 'thriller' status.
It does rate as satire, although the use of a psychopath to represent the distillation of our own most base and craven instincts and behaviours is a well-trodden (and more successfully trodden) path. Let's face it, since the chase that ended Princess Diana's life we've all known that it's our own weirdly voyeuristic drive to see each other, and our celebrities particularly, at our most vulnerable or hurt that feeds the paparazzi and shock journalism.
Jake Gyllenhaal does do a pretty neat job of capturing Bloom's twitchy descent (or ascent, depending on your POV). Rene Russo is the most improbable local news director ever rendered and suffers from the weird, unresolved and ultimately unnecessary sexual interest sub-plot. Similarly, the glancing blow Bloom has with law enforcement feels lacking in tension and intent.
For me, Nightcrawler was more an interesting film than a compelling or thrilling one. Props to Dan Gilroy - the film looks slick and gritty with Bloom's wild, shining eyes the focus of the frequent night-time scenes, then hidden behind sunglasses in daylight like he's developing into some sort of modern-day vampire. The soundtrack is grinding and unsettling. But for me these couldn't compensate for a lack of slow-burn and points of tension release that a really great thriller needs.
A solid 7 though."

" A psychopathic industry and Jake Gyllenhaal
",0.0,0.9856,2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,"""I will never ask you to do anything that I would not do myself"". To the uninitiated these words sound reassuring, however, when spoken in 2014's psychological thriller Nightcrawler, it encapsulates the discreet horror which makes it a contender for the best film of the 2010s. Jake Gyllenhaal (Prisoners) stars as Lou Bloom, a hard-working psychopath who discovers the urban world of nightcrawling, where stringers and journalists film crime scenes and sell the footage to the highest paying news outlet. As his profits grow, so does his desperation to film stories, increasingly pushing moral and legal boundaries of news reporting whilst also providing a deeper message that criticises the consistent fear-mongering and sensationalist stories generated by the news today. Everything in Nightcrawler, from the screenplay, to Dan Gilroy's direction, to the actors, including Riz Ahmed (Rogue One) and Rene Russo (Thor), culminates in a truly riveting, terrifying and occasionally comedic cinematic experience. However, the greatest praise owed to Nightcrawler is that of it's lead, Jake Gyllenhaal. Snubbed for any major award nominations, he gives his best performance as a villain we love to empathise with but also makes us shiver whenever he succeeds. Despite a hauntingly unnerving character study that chips away at the audience's sense of safety, Nightcrawler unfortunately represents a dying breed of film. However, paired with its' standout lead performance, impeccable script and one of the most intense third acts put to film, Nightcrawler, like Lou Bloom himself, manages to excel above and beyond anyone's expectations and become a true dark horse when considering the best film of the decade."

" The under belly of LA
",0.0,0.9792,2020-10-31 00:00:00,8,"Erie, suspenseful, and nuanced. This movie takes you on a journey through the eyes of a sleezy yet cunning, confident yet humble hustler named Lou as he gradually advances up the ranks of LA's crime scene journalism for news channels.Lou is a very fast learner with plenty of ambition. We see him constantly negotiating with various people he barely knows, always in an effort to maximize his potential at any given moment. The development of Lou by Gyllenhaal is superb. He found a balance between creepy and cringy, with self-assured and driven. Thus making him somewhat relatable to people who wish to hold themselves to a higher standard. He's the textbook definition of an online learner so his communication style with characters throughout leaves us uncomfortable. Yet he's so articulate and sharp you have to respect his knowledge. The story focuses entirely on Lou and his dealings, and because it's a character who you never quite know what's going on in his head, he's capable of shouldering the weight as a certified sociopath on a mission to make a name for himself. It's hard to have a singular feeling about Lou the entire film which plays to Nightcrawler's edginess.Aside from Gyllenhaal's performance, something this movie does well is the linear progression in action and scene intensity. That isn't something unique to movies but I think Nightcrawler nails it given the story arch of Lou. He transitions from the naive and clueless rookie all the way into the savage veteran willing to blur the line between innocent bystander and active player, and we're shown every linear step along the way, which is satisfying as a viewer. From car crashes to shootings, with everything taking place from inside Lou's speeding sedan as the settings winds through all of LA, the director deserves praise for capturing that ""under belly"" sentiment we all know LA to have. To that note, there's no movie stars, or walk-of-fame, or love story in this. Only a failing local news station director desperate for a revitalized channel, and a persuasive night crawler hungry for a chance up the ladder, with plenty of victims along the way.If you're tired of the happy endings where you feel great about the hero and their victories, step into the passenger seat of a red Dodge Challenger SRT and visit the world of Nightcrawler. You won't regret it"

" Lou lives in a world like ours
",0.3612,0.9847,2020-10-22 00:00:00,10,"The character of Louis Bloom in the 2014 film Nightcrawler, played impeccably well by Jake Gyllenhaal, lives in a world not unlike the real world we live in. Lou belongs to a generation of hardworking people who have made up their mind to find a career that they can learn and grow into, they're hard workers and they set high goals. Having been raised with self-esteem movement in schools that used to make them expect their needs to be considered,they know that today's work culture cannot cater to the job loyalty that could be promised in earlier generations, instead they know that they need to work their asses off and people who reach the... top of the mountain didn't just fall there by chance.^ In fact, everything after the first sentence is precisely something that's coldly uttered by Gyllenhaal's Lou with a stolid face every chance he gets to impress anyone who can employ him. His character starts to take actions that become more and more sociopathic and later border on psychopathy. And let's be honest here. Lou exists in a world not unlike ours, a world which celebrates people like him or the things he does, seen as positive traits. ""Go-getters"" that are persistent, hell bent on climbing the proverbial ladder. This is a gem of a film that will always always be an amazing piece of cinema for me.The film never feels rushed or slow, thanks to the way the story is written, with Jake Gyllanhaal's Lou and Riz Ahmed's Rick finding themselves in increasingly precarious and dangerous situations as the story proceeds. All stellar performances here. Also. this is actually the first film of Riz Ahmed that I'd seen, and it made me want to keep an eye on everything he appears in from that point on. And for me personally, this is actually one of the most important films ever made. It's also the kind of film I can rewatch and still enjoy as much as I did on the first watch, or perhaps even more."
" Gyllenhaal lifts this indictment of local television into scathing art
",0.0,0.9706,2020-10-21 00:00:00,9,"This is a riveting look at a man who will do whatever it takes to get ahead. And by luck he discovers the power of live video coverage of breaking news. This leads to his fast rise into that world because he offers footage that goes farther than any one else's.So this is a great look at a man who is obviously dangerously indifferent to consequences. He's smart, and probably on the spectrum, the character showing a cool calculation in the face of emotional excess (blood and gore, for one thing). But his lack of boundaries is what makes him successful.But the movie ends up going farther, and this is what makes it start to seem like a ""great"" movie: it indicts the television studios who hunger for this kind of news, and who manipulate it to ratings advantage. And the indictment goes further, because it's the public eventually who craves to see it--that's what ratings measure.And so there is a weird inevitability to it all that makes none of unreasonable. And the fact that it's reasonable is further chilling. Add that Gyllenhaal is brilliant in this role and you have something special happening.This idea of a ruthless photojournalist clearly goes back to Weegee in late 1930s New York (there is a great video with him narrating his methods out there on Youtube). But the idea of arriving before the police, moving evidence, and filling the needs of the press and the public all start there, at least in someone who made himself famous doing so.Watch it. Watch it twice."

" Jake Gyllenhal plays a psychopath
",0.25,0.9343,2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,"The main story of nightcrawler is not about a guy who becomes a freelancer paperazzi. that is the side story. the main story is about the behaviour of a typical psychopath, one of them who are living amongst us. not all psychopaths become serial killers, but there are traits they all have in common. they don't have empathy, not even a tiny bit. they have no compassion and no
conscience. they manipulate other people and can be extremely charmfull, if necessary to serve the plan.
about 1 - 2 % of all humans are like this. Jake Gyllenhal plays one of them and does it perfectly. it even feels embarrassing to watch him in the role of such an selfish egomaniac. his only employe, the young guy Rick, who assist him at work plays the opposite role. Rick has empathy and compassion. the movie seems unreal, because Jake Gyllenhal behaves so obvious. but actually it shows, what is happening in the real world. selfishness and the lack of morality is part of our society. Bill Paxton and Leah Fredkin also play fantastic. its not a must watch, but it is a good movie, that deserves the high rating."

" Brilliant!
",0.6239,0.9871,2020-09-15 00:00:00,9,"""Nightcrawler"" was a brilliant movie and well-made. Jake Gyllenhaal (Louis Bloom) was outstanding as I thought this was his best performance. I can't believe he didn't get an Oscar nomination. Lou Bloom was definitely a lunatic. He's so fascinated with crime scenes and wants to get the most candid shots by capturing the ugliness of a crime scene. He shows no remorse by doing this, which adds to his lunatic personality. Rene Russo (Nina Romina) was great as I enjoyed the dynamic between her and Gyllenhaal. Riz Ahmed (Rick) was good and the complete opposite of Gyllenhaal's character. I felt bad for him at the end with how he died. The last 30 minutes were filled with unpredictability and suspense.Lou reminded me of Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver"", considering I found there to be similarities between the two. Some of these are the fact how they both have mental issues, feel isolated from society, are highly intelligent people, and are rewarded at the end for their actions. However, Lou shows less compassion than Travis and only cares about himself.The portrayal of the media was excellent with the social commentary. They showed how the news only cares about getting a big story for ratings instead of just covering it down the middle. The cinematography was terrific as I loved the shots of LA and how pretty they looked.Overall, I'll give ""Nightcrawler"" a 9/10. Brilliant movie, which deserves more recognition!"
" Nightcrawler Works
",0.0,0.9869,2020-09-14 00:00:00,10,"Nightcrawler is directed and written by Dan Gilroy, it's a take on a modern Los Angeles nighttime film. That incorporates all the best elements about Drive (2011), the color, cars, and thrilling intensity. This is one of the best thrillers of the decade a lot of hard-work and dedication by Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom paid off (he lost twenty pounds for the roll). With his future appearance as Mysterio it seems his past acting is even better. Riz Ahmed is great as always and Jake had some really great chemistry with him, Riz makes Rick a really relatable and believable character. You have to be patient with this movie as you work your way through a story of news dramatizing everything, only reporting on rich white neighborhoods etc. Our protagonists are freelance photographers and overtime Lou Bloom expands his business and rakes in profit. However his lack of care about others and the morals of his recordings makes this film heat up in the third act. This makes the long and interesting wait, trying to establish each of the movie's characters in the first and second acts worth it. Oh and I can't end without mentioning Rene Russo's performance as Nina Romina, the unethical news director, who's relationship with Lou Bloom plays a key part in this films greatness."

Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was top notch, along with the action and tension packed scenes with the car chase and death of Rick. I was expecting both of them to die in the end, but I was wrong and was astounded when Lou was happily alive and well in the end. This movie brings mystery, tension, and great visuals in my opinion. Jake should've been nominated for Best Actor, and this should've had a nomination for Best Picture."

" You find that you simply can't stop watching
",0.2235,0.9734,2020-09-11 00:00:00,8,"Lou(Gyllenhaal, charismatic and intense) is driven, has no morals, and he needs to make money. So when he realises that getting footage of violence, when the police respond to crimes, is a good way to do that, he jumps at the chance.This really makes you ask questions, such as, ""when it comes to brutal images in the news, where does the line go?"". It would be easy to point the finger, and say that it's all on ""journalists"" who blindly follow ""if it bleeds, it leads"". But this goes beyond the surface, pointing out that, if viewers at home didn't tune in for this footage, then they would stop favouring it(even if they might not stop showing it all together). Perhaps we as human beings are to some extent drawn to grisly images, and that's something we need to own up to, and figure out how how to not let it go too far. This is a movie willing to be completely, terrifyingly honest about how far some will go to feed it. Some of the characters do take issue with this exploitation. This typically gets shut down by those who do not. Which is something that could very easily be preachy. But it doesn't get to be like that, due to the deft hand of first-time director Dan Gilroy. This is 1 hour and 49 minutes not counting the end credits, or 53 if you do include them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this also contains strong language. I recommend this to anyone who has the stomach for it. 8/10"

" a psychopath's life calling
",0.0,-0.8344,2020-09-07 00:00:00,9,"I am very extremely pleased that a psychopath like lou bloom here found his life calling in something that, while ugly and at time disgusting, is ultimately a good service, instead of falling into becoming a killer himself or something.
for some reason, either due to misleading trailers or misremembering information, I was lead to believe this story was one about a ""nightcrawler"" who, in an increasingly obsessive bid for hot footage, begins staging crimes or manipulating crime scenes ahead of time.
Apart from one quickly forgettable shot, he does almost none of this. He is instead always after actual crimes, actual events to film, and he is on it with an intensity that is frightening.
this is a caliber of performance that is career-defining, the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio in The Aviator, or heath ledger in the dark knight, Daniel day-lewis in there will be blood. It is not just a complete envelopment of the actor into the role, it is a genuine realness to it that becomes almost frightening, as you begin to cringe and perpetually anticipate an explosion of anger or violence that seemingly never comes. And the very first scene of the film, seemingly throwaway, makes very clear that he is not above an explosion of violence.
Throughout the film, he presents himself with a filmy, bug-eyed veneer of creepiness and discomfort that is played perfectly, never veering into unrealistic ""I'm a gross disgusting crazy idiot"" territory. He almost comes across as someone with Aspergers', or else someone very very sheltered who has essentially self-taught themselves in all aspects of their lives.Both in public and private he has the same flattened affect, slimy demeanor, and odd choice of verbiage that is just unusual enough to unsettle without it ever being too much. It's less like an alien mingling among hume-mons and more like someone in the 1990s talking like they're from the 2000s.
The best part about it is the character is essentially at home where he is. This is what he does and likes doing and is actually good at and it and it is literally his whole life. Nothing he does or says in the film is not in complete and total service to the job he does. And the most astonishing part is, as we see from the beginning, he had absolutely no interest or intent until he comes across a flaming car wreck and sees someone creeping on the police with a camera, filming the event. Literally the scene right before this he is pouring his intense ""is he autistic or a manic psychopath"" energy into getting hired at a construction site he just sold stolen copper to.
If the construction foreman had hired lou bloom at that spot, the ensuring film would very likely still be a incredibly wild and unsettling adventure.lou bloom is literally like a virus or a highly sophisticated parasite. He could've come from nowhere, been born yesterday, dropped by aliens last week, and he immediately fixates on whatever job opportunity he comes across, to the point of becoming a literal expert almost overnight, with competitors offering to partner with him.
this is why I say I am very glad that lou bloom latched onto the field of ""nightcrawling"" and succeeded beyond his wildest dream. If he had walked into a city council meeting while still unemployed, he'd be governor of California by the next election cycle, and he would be dangerous."

The idea that this out of work nobody, gets a video camera and a police scanner to find news stories worth video taping.This is real life, in the sense that this is what happens with news today. Yeah, they have the news trucks and the professional video person working the beat, but they arrive after the crime has been cleaned up by law enforcement.The real news comes from the people who roam the streets trying to get news as it is happening. These Nightcrawlers are usually bottom feeders, but they usually get the juiciest shots.This movie has a good cast, good script and it moves fast and doesn't stop. The ending is a shocker to me because most movies from Hollowood are worthless. They have the Prince and Princess riding off in to the sunset to be married and live happily ever after. This movie doesn't exactly do that, because it leaves you with a feeling of creepy, dark, slim covering you.The ending is the best part of the whole movie to me.

I was more interested in the development of the character than the actual plot (which wasn't bad at all). By the end of the film, you will see a character that has gone a long way but that hasn't really changed at the core.It's an enjoyable experience, there are some scenes that are particularly interesting and I would say that it's probably one of the best films of this genre.

Driven by a mesmerising performance from Jake Gyllenhaal's as a jargon-babbling media business fantasist who nevertheless has a real skill for analysing and learning what matters in the world of television news. Nightcrawler is both creepy (geddit? creepy crawler?) and jaw-droppingly comic in the same inappropriate way that Joachim Phoenix's Joker is. Don't read anything about the plot (which is tight, simple and compulsively involving). Just go with the palaver, the schmooze and the get-rich-quick salesman patter of Gyllenhaal's lost-puppy yet jarringly overconfident anti-hero, even as the story turns down one after another morally underexposed backstreets. Hints of both Network and Dog Day Afternoon, among other classics, take nothing from a movie that will undoubtedly be seen as a classic in its own right in due course, one that is as fresh, surprising and troubling as anything in recent years. Highly, highly recommended."

",0.0,0.9853,2020-08-15 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
lead actor; Jake Gyllenhal brings one of his finest performances in this engaging movie. His portrayal is layered, sharp and captivating, making the character come alive in a threatening and troubled way. We might question the ethical dilemmas that the character has but we cannot question the class of acting that is done to bring us a character who is narcissistic and sociopath, showing no remorse, emotions and regards for anyone but himself.-it's a well executed movie with a beautiful screenplay, beautiful in a sense that the writing is smooth, raw at times, real and gory, making it as real as it gets. The direction is praiseworthy and so does the entire team of the movie.
What did not work:
-maybe I would have wanted some scenes from the television set to be cut down if it was possible , not that they hindered the narrative but at times they were given some more importance. Again, it's considerable considering the nature of the movie.
minor loopholes; I would have liked the movie more if a scene was added where he tries to exhibit his innocence in the shootout at the end of the movie. Maybe some scenes about what he does in the day time would be nice to understand him better.Final verdict: recommended"

I don't know if the whole film is itself a metaphor or something, but you don't get anything to learn from it.The film redefines the pattern of thriller films. There's an abnormality in the lead character that makes you question the existence of such people in real life. Generally, in thriller films, you'll be forced to connect with the lead character (usually female) who gets stuck up in a really complex situation and we'll all be expecting a 'close enough' escape but in this film, the lead character shows no signs of humanity and as he says in the film it becomes, 'our choice' to watch the film or not.What amuses me is this way that they've written a script that would perfectly fit into a short film into a feature film because the entire film is in the format of a short film explaining the life of the lead, in a suspenseful way. The climax too was not a shock or something, anyone could've guessed it. Thus, I've reviewed this film successfully as optimistic as it's tone. 6 out of 10."

" Deadly Scoop
",0.1531,-0.9749,2020-07-27 00:00:00,8,"In this debut feature by Dan Gilroy, the director and screenwriter constructs a disturbing story about society and the media.
The story is about Louis Bloom, a loser looking for a job who finds his passion in recording macabre images and selling them to television. This is undoubtedly a deranged and twisted character, with a chilling performance by Jake Gyllenhaal. Gilroy constructs the psychology of the character as a representation of society and its taste for morbidness. This criticism directed not only to the consumer society but also to the television media becomes especially relevant through this story, which in the first instance seems to lack a boost, but which in the third act shocks and horrifies.
There is an atmosphere of constant unease, not only visually, but also narratively, as the director strikes the viewer head-on with situations that cause discomfort, but at the same time you cannot stop seeing. In this way, the viewer becomes one more accomplice of this consumption system, where disturbing images and situations flow like a river.
There is no doubt that 'Nightcrawler' is a gripping and dark debut for Gilroy, which cannot be overlooked and pleased while causing concern."

The cinematography and the camera work is so good that even the night looks very bright. I loved that car - Dodge Challenger RED. So stunningly beautiful especially during the night time.
The car chasing scenes are wonderful.The depreciating part of the entire film is the inhuman character of the actor.
He causes death to his competitor just to film him to sell the footage to the media, and he does not stop there, he continues to do the same by getting his partner killed and films his dying just for the footage and of-course money.
So he is ready to go to any length to survive in this world. And I think he did the best in a sweet way.It is very uninspiring to watch, yet i rate it 6/10 for above mentioned reasons."

Truth be told, no this isn't like infinity wars or mission impossible. This movie is not at all aiming to entertain very pleasently so one can enjoy their popcorn.This movie tells the story of a person I would consider to be a clinical psychopath that talks like he just read a book called "" how to build a company and be a winner"" and treats humans around him unspeakably bad to a degree where you feel pain seeing it.The reason this movie is so great is how we can see the plot of a movie through the eyes of the villain who also happens to be our protagonist. Jake Gyllenhaal is acting his best here. Probably his best performance so far. I would say that without him this movie might just have ended up as a mediocre film, a 5-6 / 10 but his insane performance makes this freakshow so thrilling that you can literally not distinguish between the actor and the finctional lunatic anymore.I don't wanna get too much into detail though. The ending of the movie is absolutely phenomenal and all in all it's almost flawless til then.The only reason I am struggling to give it 10/10 is that the part about him being sexually attracted to the elderly woman, which just completely disgusted me and I found it unecessary but maybe someone else finds especially this obscure part extremely good and therefore likes it even better. Maybe it deserves the 10/10 couldn't say.Make sure you don't have to pause when watching and you can see it in one go for the maximum experience.My 0,00$"

It fails to really keep you that interested, an ambulance chaser with a video camera selling the content to a news channel doesn't have the interest value when there's no real storyline.
Jake Gyllenhaal however is excellent as the sociopath who decides to make a business out of filming grisly crimes and accidents to sell to TV news. Its worth watching just to see his performance but the movie itself is rather unremarkable and overlong.
There are also too many holes in the plot, he would never get away with half of the antics.

",-0.0258,0.1027,2020-06-16 00:00:00,8,"A biting, dark, ironic and memorable thriller, Jake Gyllenhaal has created one of the best roles of his career. It was 2014's Drive. The theme of Nightcrawler involves a great deal of social and moral criticism, but the commentary on social economy is the main focus. And the second half of the film to the moral corruption of the provocation makes the film to get a magic sublimation. It may seem counterintuitive to show ""Nightcrawler"" in time for Halloween, but then again, what's wrong with such a graphic and gripping anti-social portrait. From a humble beginning, ""Nightcrawler"" makes a sourly funny mockery of journalism, the job market and self-help culture, one by one."
" Nightcrawler, beware the beast in black - 95

The fierce satire that ""Nightcrawler"" targets modern media coverage and the lack of morality in news ethics is far from misguided, but is sometimes maybe hammered in a little too well. Despite this, ""Nightcrawler"" is a film that neatly and effectively shows the morbid thirst of all the people involved. And is an extremely vibrant thriller that manages to offer an equal dose of night-black social satire.With an very fascinating character, Lou that is in the moral darkness in which he ends up and see how far he actually goes is an equally refined and entertaining experience. With his studied and psychopathic behaviour, almost manic appearance, an extremely unpleasant person is created, as the slender Gyllenhaal portrays with brilliance."

It deserves a 10-star rating, but, to me, for a movie to get that rating, it has to wow me. This movie didn't, but it didn't have any apparent flaws.

(which does not happen often - this usually isn't my genre, but this film is just SUBLIME in storytelling!)The writing and direction is brilliant. There is a clear vision of how to portray LA and the sleek, brooding and dark tone that plays out perfectly the big screen. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance... on point. I didn't know these tones he brought out from him... they fit so well with the character.Nightcrawler takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of Louis Bloom.
The movie has a clear message on the media and how they abuse stories and reap the benefits regardless of who gets victimized. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou and watch his transformation from being a sleazy but ambitious individual to becoming a manipulative, self-serving sociopath. Then you start to realize that he was like that all along. His charming charisma masked his true intentions, and this peek into his psyche is the most potent and disturbing aspect of the movie. It's a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle... multilayered, deep, true.The cinematography and editing was for me on point as well, fast and slow cuts, amazing variety in pace and tone. We stay ALWAYS glued to the mind and realm of Lou, we get sucked into his life at night (only in the beginning and end we see him by daylight, did you notice?). This is SUBLIME storytelling.Nightcrawler a work of art: directing (storytelling), writing, acting... and basic human nature. It really does a hell of a job at sucking you into this dark gloomy world... It's thrilling, it's powerful, and most of all, it feels like it's real. It is INTENSE."
" Bloom is a morally repugnant character
",0.0,-0.9402,2020-06-03 00:00:00,9,"The production of this film is flawless, the script is tight & Jake Gyllenhaal's performance lingers long after the end titles.A skeletal stature, Bloom's eyes bulge from the sockets as he rarely blinks, delivering his lines in a clinical manner, always a slight deviant glint in his eye & his smile. From the beginning there's just something lurking under the surface that doesn't feel right about Bloom, and it's slowly peeled back during the film to reveal him as a sociopath. Manipulative; arrogant, sleazy, egotistical & most certainly callous - his lack of empathy for human life is astounding. Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely superb throughout, creating a character that is so morally repugnant it's hard to forget him.In the beginning of the film, I definitely empathised with Louis' character.
Having to resort to petty crimes for income, due to unemployment, his persistence to better his circumstances (even if he has to work from the bottom up) is admirable. My opinion quickly changed when he became more and more obsessive with building a repertoire of grisly crime scene footage; each one more risqué than the next, exploiting a homeless man to become part of his news footage 'crew' and essentially staging murders to boost his career.The film is not a satire, but a scathing social commentary about the media & the content they air to boost ratings (victims need to be white & affluent, injured at the hands of the poor/minority & must be gory). Statements delivered in the film such as - ""if it bleeds it leads"", is deeply disturbing though reigns true; and we as viewers are equally complicit - our integrity questioned by our gluttony for blood.The relationship Bloom strikes with Nina is troublesome on many levels. Firstly his coercion of her to be submissive to his demands professionally and sexually & that she finds his murderous ways inspiring.Likes:
-The music was calculating (like the cogs inside Bloom's brain)

" Nightcrawler
",0.0,0.6309,2020-05-20 00:00:00,9,"Nightcrawler is a realistic and dark film about a sociopath turning a smaller buisness into an eventual larger business, by filming and manipulating gruesome crimes, in order to put them on the news, glorifying and instilling fear into the people. He does whatever it takes to get what we wants, innocent's dying, manipulating a womens career, almost setting up a brutal crime, by withh olding information from the police and allowing his ""employee"", to be killed. This film touches on the subject how news glorifies brutality, and how big corporations and the people part of them, will do whatever it takes to achieve higher, touching on the major theme and subject of the evil side of capitalism. Lou Bloom, searches for power, but also for meaning. He is a sociopath, and doesn't connect with or like people, and find his true place to grasp power and manipulate, through his news company. This film explores the worldview of capitalism, as Lou is a white male manipulating his minority employee, as he also explicitly states that the news wants urban crime leaking into the suburbs as stories, to instill fear. The cinematography, editing, lighting, and framing are dark, gritty are perfectly fitting. The script is brillant. Lou Bloom speaks like a person imitating a real person, and uses his false charming and manipulative words to lure his employee and Nina into his game. He has no formal education, he says he spends time on his computer trying to learn new skills and take in knowledge, in order for him to excel, as he speaks facts and demands with no understanding of any human elements behind them. He doesn't understand buisness ethics and doesn't know to function in society. The score is meant to be taken as it is from Bloom's perspective, as he believes that he truimphat, after manipulating a dead body into view of his camera. And at first, the audience is tricked into rooting for Bloom. Ome of the film's essential themes, is that us, the audience, lets bad people rise to power because they give us things. That the ones will all the power were the ones willing to do anything, and step on anyone to do it. This is implied by Nina a few times in the film, and the film also shows corrupt capitalism and its connection to racism. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is amazing. The film's major theme is that it exposes the spirit of capitalism, and what the human spirit becomes in America. A character like Lou, who is disconnected from society, who probably wasn't correctly diagnosed, and gets all of knowledge through the internet and self help books, arrogant, emphatically bare, demanding and and succeeds through that. As this film takes the more realistic look at the underdog to riches story, and removes the downfall, as in Lou's case, he's only going to get more poweful. He is clever, with a learned and false sense of niceness. And in the beginning, Gilroy makes the audience almost feel sorry for Lou, with traits of likeable not relating to morality. The problem isnt Lou, the problem is the society that rewards him. The advantages of sociopathy in a capitalist society."

Much like the picture's scathing depiction of modern-day mainstream media, filmgoers find themselves glued and unable to look away from its at times grotesque and confronting imagery, thanks to some slick filmmaking from first-time director Dan Gilroy, alongside real wife Rene Russo, and his tight screenplay's smart social commentary permeated with a sick sense of humour, not to mention an intensely moody atmosphere and teeth-clenching sequences.

While watching the news have you ever asked yourself, ""How did they film this?"" you will love this film. You probably know the answer and don't want to believe it. Yes, the movie is extreme and unrealistic at times but Gyllenhaal's acting makes the character so likable that you become the man next to his seat and question his decisions and sometimes even believe what he is doing is right. A solid movie overall, but the first 20 minutes is a bit slow and also in the first 20 minutes Gyllenhaal's acting might seem irritating but when you get used to it then you realize that he is no longer Gyllenhaal, he is a different person."

Captivating human nature as it absolutely is and making it even grittier, bloodier and absolutely nuts in realistic way.As we wander with Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) on his night journeys looking for opportunities that will make all those light-hearted sick and even go beyond what seems to be reasonable but you will just be sucked into watching because it is amazing in every single way.

He might be presented in villainous way that is constantly opposing healthy state of mind but makes you trust him because of ability to persuasion.Gilroy's Nightcrawler is one of greats that 2010s offer and will be on must see lists.

What I mean by that is, take how a robot solves problems and stick it into a human. This movie always has you grinding your teeth and on the edge of your seat. You keep saying No! Don't do that! but the score says yes, this is good. It's unsettling. I found this movie very enjoyable. My small complaints are mainly with how the story is progressed. Louis seems to go from amateur to big shot in a montage. Also, I felt the climax of this film could have had a large build up. I wish that we got to see more behind what makes Louis tick.

It plunges you into the deep end of the world of peril and tragedy - without being violent or brutal. The film is so realistically done that some scenes are difficult to watch due to the tragic (realistic) nature of them.This is an interesting insight into how footage for newscasts is obtained - sometimes so easily overlooked. It's also a sad fact that a price tag is determined by the level and scale of a tragedy. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic. He has a constant eeriness about him. There's such a strong resemblance here to Joaquin Phoenix' performance in 'Joker'. The film is creepy and disturbing in so many ways, and in many instances it has nothing to do with what is directly displayed on screen.The film has a stunning, nail biting climax. Although a very good film, I probably won't be watching it again due to the nature of the film.https://paulsmoviereviews"

" Long before there was ""fake news"" there were odious newsmen...
",-0.4767,0.5574,2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Jake Gyllenhaal is superbly charismatic and worryingly plausible in this story about a failed con man who discovers there is a living to be made from tapping into police communications and then getting to the scene of the crimes to film and sell on the incidents to the constantly avaricious news organisations. He finds one such character in Rene Russo, the editor of an under-performing news channel. Together they form a relationship that fuels both of their almost psychopathic needs for attention and success, with little regard for the truth - indeed he soon loses perspective between reacting to crimes and starts to create opportunity. Riz Ahmed is good, too, as his sidekick. It's a bit on the long side, but sharply directed."
" A Distressing, Indispensable Piece of Haunting Cinema
",-0.5859,0.0516,2020-02-17 00:00:00,9,"Ambulance-chasing with the latest form of human pond scum, an aggressive crowd of opportunistic late-night freelance photographers who make their living from the graphic misfortune of others. ""If you're seeing me, you're having the worst day of your life,"" brags the new recruit in this bloodthirsty professional sport, a hauntingly detached functional sociopath played by Jake Gyllenhaal.It's a top-notch performance, Patrick Bateman-esque in its eerie moral bankruptcy. Laser-focused and analytical in all things, he's amoral to the core. He communicates in long, precise sentences that cut straight to the point, strategically disarming his conversational adversaries before they even know they've entered a sparring match. If not for the obvious physical indications, one might question if he's human at all. The one exception might be his fondness for composition, an endless pursuit of sublime photographic harmony amidst the broken glass and shattered bodies of a fatal auto accident. The rescue crews and police officers, also present amidst the carnage, are mere obstacles between his lens and the natural beauty he finds, bleeding and gurgling, upon the asphalt.As Gyllenhaal grows bolder and more calculated in his nightly hunt for that next great shot, the stakes increase and his eye grows more selective. It all culminates in a masterful climax, a white-knuckle chase scene, that pulled me from my cozy spot on the couch to a closer seat on the floor, a few feet removed from the TV screen. I can't remember the last time I was so invested in a story."

" Top notch, well worth two hours of your time.
",0.5859,0.9854,2020-01-28 00:00:00,9,"This is an original, brooding, and sometimes sinister film.First, the technical stuff. It's all extremely good. The acting is exceptional. Gyllenhaal is brilliant as the psychopathic lead, who sometimes exhibits moments of calculated exploitative warmth towards his vulnerable employee to make him do what he wants. He is a cynical manipulator, only interested in absorbing any information he can to get ahead and make money. He has no scruples. There are several moments where one expects him to do something human, but he never quite gets there. Some of the directorial and acting magic here is in making you think he might get there.Rene Russo is scorching as the beautiful but cynical TV director. When I was watching I didn't realise it was Rene Russo, and I was curious as to who this fantastic actress was. I was surprised when I read it was her because she owned the role so effectively, I just saw her as a unique character. The relationship between the two leads is the best part of the film. Just as Gyllenhal manipulates his employee in a two dimensional way, Russo uses Gyllenhal in a much more subtle way. The power dynamic between these two excellent actors is tense and smouldering throughout. They are an excellent couple.Everything else is great. Cinematography, sound, atmosphere are all bang on, The world that this film is set is our world, but it feels darkly dystopian due to the way the story unfolds and the subject matter.This is a story about our society and about us. It's about what we are willing to demand, then observe and consume. In a free marketplace of ideas where we can absorb any information that we wish to, no matter how extreme, it explores how that environment can be ruthlessly exploited and indeed manipulated for gain by those with no morals, no scruples and no humanity. There are lessons in this story for law makers, counter terrorism practitioners, police and academics. Do you ever feel manipulated by what you watch? Then watch this film."
" Gyllenhaal at his best
",0.6369,0.3335,2020-01-24 00:00:00,8,Great film. As the movie goes on it just gets creepier and creepier. If you thought Gyllenhaal couldn't get any weirder then Donnie Darko you were wrong.

Writing a type of script I've never seen before. The part depicting the situation of the hero at the beginning is very effective. Because of that, the man's action, which is moral destruction, is somehow acceptable. The thrilling part where the driven protagonist behaves like a hungry wildlife is amazing. The absence of a family at all accelerates the mysterious and wild atmosphere.
Writer Dan Gilroy is a very successful writer and has written some interesting screenplays. He supervise it himself, as he find it particularly interesting I think. He had done a great direction so movie became a masterpiece."

" The (Anti) Hero's Journey
",0.0,0.9973,2020-01-12 00:00:00,10,"Nightcrawler is a gloriously dark journey through night-time Los Angeles, where Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is making a name for himself as a ""stringer"" - a freelance journalist who captures graphic footage of crime scenes, turning a profit by selling it to TV stations. Unlike many journalist protagonists who came before him, Lou doesn't endeavour to walk a tightrope between legitimate reporting and exploitative intrusion; instead, he shamelessly scavenges for the most provocative - and therefore most profitable - material, going so far as to engineer crime scenes to create the grisliest effect. Lou's manipulation of the world around him is not limited to the crimes he stages; rather, it extends to all aspects of his life, which he is able to manipulate to his advantage. Nightcrawler is a fantastic film because it delights in Lou's capacity to make his desires manifest, and depicts his tenacity and nerve with humour. It succeeds because it never defers to its audience with obligatory scenes, such as explaining away Lou's behaviour or doling out the justice that many audience members yearn for.Nightcrawler attests to the power of cinematography to support characterisation and sub-text. A wide-angle lens is paired with shallow depth of field throughout the film, often rendering everything on screen out of focus except for Lou. This serves to reflect Lou's worldview, in which he is the only thing that matters. Lou's isolation from other people is reflected in the framing of shots, which frequently position him on his own rather than in over-the-shoulder or two-shots which would signify intimacy with other characters. Even when sharing the frame with another person, long shots are employed to suggest distance. As a result, Lou's aloneness in the world is palpable, his separation from society conveyed through visual techniques.I found the scenes where Lou is capturing footage on his camera to be the most visually interesting. While the crime scenes and dead bodies that comprise Lou's subject matter are presented as blurry and out of focus through the film's lens, we can simultaneously see the images depicted with clarity through the viewfinder in Lou's camera. This demonstrates how Lou's interest in reality and the world around him is contingent on its purpose within the media, and ultimately his own success.Nightcrawler could not have succeeded without Jake Gyllenhaal's fantastic portrayal of the voracious Louis Bloom. It was satisfying to watch Gyllenhaal cast against his usual type of wide-eyed ingenu here. His expressive eyes, usually employed to fawn over women in romantic comedies, are disturbingly repurposed in Nightcrawler to express his fascination with the suffering of others, and how it will serve his lofty ambitions. Gyllenhaal simultaneously conveys emotional detachment towards the world around him and emotional intensity towards that which is incidental to his success.A reading of other reviews regarding Nightcrawler suggests there is a multitude of ways of reading this film. Some view the film as a commentary on the exploitative nature of the media, which capitalises on selling human suffering as entertainment. This perspective condemns the media for motivating behaviour such as Lou's. This is a weak argument, given that Lou's deviant behaviour is evident before he is rewarded for it. The media didn't create Lou, it is merely a convenient platform for him.Nightcrawler has also been interpreted as a satire of millennial entitlement and the cultural adage that one can achieve anything as long as they try hard enough. Lou references the importance of hard work throughout the film, and even states ""I was raised with the self-esteem movement so popular in schools"". Further, Lou projects an exaggerated image of himself and his company (Video Production News) in a manner not dissimilar to the embellished social identities projected by millennials on social media platforms. The marketing campaign for Nightcrawler played on this concept by setting up Twitter and LinkedIn profiles for Louis Bloom, as well as posting a video resume on YouTube, thereby reflecting the bootstrapping ideology of millennial culture.
I take issue with the above interpretations, as they suggest that the film is condemning Lou's behaviour. In watching Nightcrawler it is clear that the film delights in Lou's tenacity and nerve, revelling in the absurdity of his behaviour. Thus, I prefer to read the film as a comment on embracing one's true nature rather than conforming to the social norm. The journey of Nightcrawler sees Lou progress from attempting to fit into a traditional lifestyle at the beginning - where he attempts to get an unpaid internship during the daytime - to accepting that he is at his best when separated from societal expectations. Lou discovers the world of stringer journalism, where his natural inclinations are rewarded. As a result, Lou is more powerful and more authentic when he exits the film than when he enters it. As such, Nightcrawler is ultimately a film about coming into your own and finding a path to expressing your true nature. It is about the triumph of authenticity over conformity, the triumph of the individual over society."
" Dark, disturbing and superbly acted character study of a psychopathic Jake Gyllenhaal
",-0.5106,0.9715,2020-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Jake Gyllenhaal, as so many times before, stands out as the star of the film with a brilliant and almost scarily good interpretation of an emotionally disconnected, intelligent and manipulative psychopath.Being a so called ""nightcrawler"", Gyllenhaal's Louis ""Lou"" Bloom utilizes a police radio to be first on location of violent crime scenes, with the goal of capturing gruesome and brutally honest footage that he sells to news outlets for good money. As one might expect, the movie has car chases, gunfire and fights, but it is very much not an action movie. Instead, it confidently focuses on the study and evolution of a very interesting and well-crafted main character, and does so without compromising on action, intensity and emotion.The visuals are lovely, and the depressing sight of a dark and brutal Los Angeles creates a truly special feeling, and accentuates the madness of the world Gyllenhaal's character lives in.""Nightcrawler"" is a truly great film, filled with memorable scenes, and one that will most likely stick with me for a long time."
" a great storytelling and an enjoyable experience
",0.7906,0.9073,2020-01-01 00:00:00,9,"This film describes what may happen to a psychiatric disorder in need of a work,the first thing i want to talk to about in this movie is the way to tell the story, the film builds events from the beginning of the movie in the first hour of it, we understand that it is a study of personality of louis bloom so that we understand the troubled nature of him with the progress of events ,we see his lack of conscience and how he is ready to do anything in order to achieve his goals, and all this with a prelude to the plot that appeared in the last half an hour of the movie and it is creative and not easy to build the plot for the duration of the film and then show it at the end
the second thing that i want to talk about is the performance of jake gyllenhaal, jake performed more than wonderful in this movie especially in reversing louis bloom's moments in his frustrations and successes and all that in the mold of his psychological problems
the only thing i didn't like about the movie was the end, i see that the end was frustrating and made some things in the film meaningless or in other words unnecessary ,the end would have been much better and yet this dose not detract from the magnificent and creativity of the film whether in terms of directing ,acting ,etc.
in the end nightcrawler is a very great experience that will enjoy you every moments."
" Disturbing
",-0.5106,0.0302,2019-12-30 00:00:00,4,"First and foremost, before i watch this movie, i thought that i'm going to love this moview. It took my attention. The idea is nice: An answer of a neurotic and thief on how to be a license to print money. But it is a great lack that there is no display of thsubstructure of character's work that he was doing. I mean it is really that there is no basic detail about that on a movie which shows everything realistically. It looks surreal that the character tells that ""He learns everything on Internet"" even if he acts realistically. Therefore there are two main problems underlying the movie: First is the contradiction between the movie's realistic process and its unreal scenario. I mean it really worths nothing for a machiavelist man, who hates all ""empty career achievement words"" and his main goal is to become a media boss. However, the main goal of a man who makes all this masterplans in the movie, should not be as simple as that.Second main problem is the moral sentiment of the movie. The machiavelist type of the character is getting much disturbing with the great acting of Jake Gyllenhaal. However there comes a moral judgment in the eye of the watchers, with the intention of producer: There is only one man who is an utter machiavelist and this machiavelist makes his job best. Therefore, there comes a judgment that, ""i don't want this man to be successful."" At the end of the first half of the movie i thought that, there are two possibilities for the ending of the movie. Either, this machiavelist, greedy man will obtain his goal or the ethical values and the moral principles will overcome the story's itself and everything will be upside-down and this greedy man will fall. So the ending is easy to predict but i wanted the second possibility at least but it did not happen ant it really distrub the viewer. Okey, it is the reality of life you can not achieve something, without stamping someone. Nevertheless, when i say that i ""generalize"" it. I know that it is wrong but i would have tied the ending to more psychological thing. At least i would have tied the ending, for the character who lives like a robot and does not have a background, to a more suitable and tangible thing which would have made it a good villain. The best thing about the disturbance of the character is the acting of Gyllenhaal."
" Reliable Jake.
",0.0,0.1112,2019-12-30 00:00:00,7,"Nightcrawler is an encapsulating experience, Gyllenhaal's uncompromisingly wicked.A very good film, but I wouldn't go any further than that. Louis compliments Nina on her method of shutting down her colleague and says he learns quickly, later giving her a bit of self realization, putting her in her place. However, Bloom's never tested himself or has any sort of self-awakening, just cold and sinister. Rick's somewhat endearing and humorous, but only halfway. It's a unique ending, that he walks away freely with no comeuppance. There will always be those that cheat the system, so it's hard to compete fairly. If there's a buyer willing to overlook morals and decency, there will always be a do-er."

It is told from the perspective, in a Taxi Driver fashion, of a lonely man trying to get his piece of the American Dream. He's not trying to fit in or becoming the greatest. He just wants to fight to get somewhere. And commendably.Nightcrawler is about a man who randomly turns to news reporting as a hobby, and it eventually becomes a full time job. He ends up reporting various crimes and murders around LA, and hands the footage and information in to local broadcasters. When he gets some great footage of a murder as it's happening, he decides to mix his story with the murder story to get the perfect footage he could sell.It's not as complicated as I've wrote it to be. My favorite aspect of the movie is that it's about a cool loser in Los Angeles, living on the other side of the fence. He doesn't want to work a normal job, and instead takes up this weird hobby. The hobby ends up being pretty cool, and he becomes pretty successful at it. It gives people hope that one day they'll finally discover something that makes them who they are.Jake Gyllenhall does excellent in this movie. The lighting is perfect and eerie.

His character faces no repercussions, even though there was plenty of opportunities to give us something. I'm all for the bad guy getting away, but this seemed a bit underwhelming. It almost felt as they they were planning something bad to happen, but in the end ran out of time and decided to leave him to get away with it. Fantastic directorial debut though."
" Nightcrawler- an honest, in depth review
",0.5106,0.9956,2019-08-05 00:00:00,9,"Nightcrawler is a beautiful movie that has a tremendous amount to offer. Starting with the opening shots, we can see that the color grading makes the movie captivating. I was expecting a boring color palette of blues, reds, and blacks. However, they used a wide variety of colors to bring the night of California to life which was very important to the tone of the movie. The characters were very well written, but it was hard to be relatable to them. The characters we can relate to were too static with not enough development to care about them, but either way the acting was outstanding. Gyllenhaal portrayed a side of genuine acting that he carries with him, and in Nightcrawler, its above his other performances. His acting is used as a tool to cary suspense throughout the movie and it was highly effective. Even if the character wasn't relatable, it was made very easy to be stressed, and anxious for him. Shot composition was great, and the director of photography clearly knew what he was doing. Some parts of the movie felt cliche (like most of the driving scenes), and there was a lot that just would not actually happen if this situation was real, but it still felt real. The director made the character's desires extremely focused and I really appreciated that. What makes this movie so amazing are the characters, and the acting performance. Overall story is very well done, and dialogue is great. This movie is a must see, but by no means perfect. 9/10"
" Lou isn't the real problem, but the society who creates and rewards this type of people
",0.8141,0.9973,2019-08-05 00:00:00,10,"At first I thought about just giving the movie the 10/10, without actually writing anything. However, I finally come up with something to write. I usually to these reviews to mainly remind myself of what I thought about the movie right after seeing it, something I get lazy and don't write anything, and sometimes I forced myself to it. I loved this movie, and it got me at the egde of my sit the entire runtime basically, but it was difficult to find a specific thing I wanted to remind myself in the future.I saw some videos analyzing the movie, and bringing up the best parts of it, and the one that hock me the most was the one by the YT Channel ""Lessons from the Screenplay"" dissecting the art of building a story throughout the eyes of an anti-hero (or what some people would say, a villain, in this case). The way the film builds itself, and the layers the screenplay has are amazing, but at the end, the main reason why at some point we get ourselves rooting for the guy in a certain degree, is because at the end of the day, he is a perfect example of a ""villain"" created by society, our sensationalists news shows, wanting ratings more than the true, or even covering the most relevant stories at all, and even more, the industry that rewards this type of person, not only in the news business in this case, but the rewarding of people doing bad things overall, it's something that's overlooked, and will continue to be so as long as it makes money. That's the most amazing thing I took from this movie's story. Keep it in mind, future me.The acting is kind of a silly thing to talk about it at this point, Jake Gyllenhaal is insane, every new movie I watch from him, I become more and more a fan. The dude is ridiculously talented, has an insane charisma, and it's clearly committed as f# in his holes (he lost 20 pounds for this role). Everyone in the movie is awesome, Ahmed is great as well, he is also really talented. Everyone is basically solid as a rock in the movie.The last 20 minutes of it are insanely thrilling, the build up to it is perfect, you feel the urge, you care for what's in stake. Amazing. I truly don't have a single bad thing to point out here, so, I can't do anything but giving it a 10 out of 10."

It is beating with originality and raw force of Storytelling power and a certainly needed ability to throw the audience into a side of life that exists totally within our need for violence and our want to always see it and see it plentiful.Here we have Jake Gyllenhal playing a rather mysterious character that we immediately know is ultimately up to no good despite is Passion despite maybe possibly wanting to do good in success. this character is highly intelligent, highly educated, and highly confident in his speech and Carries himself brilliantly everywhere he goes. where he goes is a peek behind the curtain and the News industry and the need to get a story 4 furthering that need for violence and for the crime. It shows how moral is almost basically non-existent. People are stories nothing more and nothing less. There's a whole team of various reporters various new screws going out to the city at night and trying to find any wrongdoing any chaos or any destruction or any active violence that they can use for that said story.Everything here is so brilliantly done from The Shear Excellence of the acting by our lead Lewis Bloom played by Jake Gyllenhaal, to the constantly moving script by Dan Gilroy who also very well directed the film.. he captures The Nightlife of the city of Los Angeles with absolute realism and absolute Grit. There are really no good guys in this story, everyone is full of greed. That's is what makes it so brilliant. It works on all these levels. Rather it wants to be a piece on the world of news and our need for it or a story about the disintegration of humanity from that. It even has a bit in here about how to create a business and expand it. All of the thrills come from our leaders, who are consistently determined and shockingly so.That is what makes this a brilliant movie. It works on all of these levels and is greatly benefitted from all the talent aborad. Destined to become a modern classic it just might be."

I literally have no words for Jake Gyllenhaals performance, i doubt that anyone could have played this role as he did. It's just stunning how well he fits the character.
It also should make everyone think about the way news are made and how we're all have a much too high inclination towards sensationalism. After this, you really question how that does ANY good.

One of the best parts about the movie is the stunning performance and physical appearance/transformation of Jake Gyllenhaal. Lou is a character that much of the time makes you feel very uncomfortable thanks to the way he speaks and the way he is written. The plot always feels like it is progressing. There is a great feeling that you get of Lou's antics becoming more and more extreme. The film lacks humor and I think it plays to the style of Lou himself, a person that barely seems to know what humor is. The downside of this movie is too me it seems very plain. The point is to see how others interact with Lou as someone who very calmly and professionally responds. Lou does not evolve as a character only evolve in business, professionalism, and in relationships with others. Overall very interesting film with a dark tone that works well for the subject matter, but as a movie it seems that the 2 hour runtime plays against it seemingly wearing out the audience by the end."

Main character is the best in acting, just like he is in other movies like Source Code. Others are not the worst either. There is lot of reality and relationship stuff here. Like in real life, it shows that there will be always issues with people in form of competition, dealing, extortion, threats, demands, and complaining. We need to set our limits in each of these said aspects. Money, number of people, time, everything is a number and has its limit. Otherwise we may suffer consequences.

character dramas in recent history.Gyllenhaal's performance is one of his best, and he leaves the viewer's eyes glued to the screen as they are simultaneously left waiting to see if his character will succeed, while hoping he doesn't.With its sinister tone and spectacular performances, it's a nice contrast to the CGI filled events taking over the screens these days.

",0.0,-0.8732,2019-04-27 00:00:00,8,"As films go, this seems like an unassuming story - a journalist following stories in LA to make money photographing crime scenes - but nothing about Nightcrawler is to be expected. Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal on one of his strongest roles to date) is one of the most unsettling characters in film today, a disjointed, borderline criminal looking for both an adrenaline rush and easy money. Bloom is undoubtedly what makes this movie, but there is far more to it than just well-written characters.The dynamic between Gyllenhaal and Rick (the role that brought Riz Ahmed to American audiences) shows how uneasy the atmosphere is, whilst the competition with rival cameraman Joe Loder (played by the late Bill Paxton) shows just how far some people are willing to go for money. The deeper the plot goes, the more Bloom treads the border of sanity and the law, making decisions that others would consider reprehensible. Nightcrawler is worth watching for the tension and the drama - but don't forget to appreciate the darkness of LA's criminal underbelly."

" It contains such a unique and well written screenplay
",0.2732,0.9751,2019-04-02 00:00:00,9,"Nightcrawler written and directed by Dan Gilroy, contains such a unique and well written screenplay. This film is based around Jake Gyllenhaal's character who takes it upon himself to film public tragedies in order to sell it to news channels. This then becomes an intense obsession for him, leading to acts of crime, just to get the perfect shot. This film really allows the audience to think twice while viewing news stories. It represents the emotional manipulation as well as exaggeration enforced behind the scenes, in order to gain a reaction from the public. The performance by Jake Gyllenhaal in this film is beyond Oscar worthy, and is widely considered to be his best acting performance ever...Although he didn't receive a golden globe or an Oscar nomination... Anyways this film contains highly suspenseful and exciting moments which at times can be truly horrifying. This movie is extremely memorable, with such insane and uneasy moments. It's a film which blurs the lines of morality and makes you question aspects of humanity. My one flaw surrounds the cinematography during car chases. I've seen it been done a lot better in films like Drive and The Place Beyond The Pines. I feel like if the camera work and direction was more exciting in those moments, it could've really elevated the intensity of the action scenes. All in all, everything else in this film is flawless. Jake Gyllenhaal along with excellent writing means a spectacular film. So therefore I give Nightcrawler a 9."

" Relevant for our current times
",0.0,0.7906,2019-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a loner thief in Los Angeles. He changes direction and turns to filming intrusive close-up scenes of violent crimes and sells the footage to a local TV station with the assistance of a young man Rick (Riz Ahmed) who is desperately unemployed.Director/screenwriter Dan Gilroy does a fine job in keeping the film filled with excitement and suspense. The script is praiseworthy as there is never a predictable moment. It's a tense ride throughout with only rare scenes of violence but many scenes of violence's aftermath.In ""Nightcrawler"", Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances as someone who is morally vacant with no humanity at all while being very adept and skillful at the creepy work that he does. It's a chilling experience to watch him go through the motions. His performance is well matched by Ahmed as well as René Russo as an equally amoral news director at the TV station.A subtle backdrop to this film is a cruel economy that sometimes encourages some people to grovel at the bottom of the barrel to get any kind of paid work. Lou is an obvious example. Rick could easily represent the many in his generation who are forced into unpaid/underpaid internships or something equally as horrible.The ending is satisfying though there seems to be perhaps a feeling of too much soullessness. However, if Gilroy's intention was to use this to show the hyper-sleaze of tabloid TV news and the bleakness of our modern culture, he succeeds hands-down."
" It's a cold world
",0.0,0.9029,2019-02-08 00:00:00,8,"I found this movie adressing me in an unexpected way. For me it was not only about the dark and immoral side of human mind, but also about where that side often surfaces, in work. I hope I'm not alone with my interpretation.The story is about Lou Bloom, a smart and charismatic psychopath, who, despite of his obvious talents, is a small time crook. One night he crashes into freelance news cameramen who are covering crimes and accidents and makes a career choice at once.And it seems he does well for himself. He has exactly the right set of skills for the work. No consciousness, moral or sense of empathy and a talent to manipulate people. From there on, we can follow Lou's morally grotesque way to the top of the business.Everything he does is as succesfull as it is morally wrong. The things he does to his assistant, competitor and also to his boss, who by the way doesn't deserve any more sympathy either, are really beyond disgusting. It showcases the freelancer news shooter scene as very cold world where victims are seens as dollars and cents and the misfortune of others is the fortune of nightcrawler. People are really not people at all, just expendable assets.What brings the added extra intensity to Lou's character is phenomenal performance of Jake Gyllenhaal. He actually lost a lot of weight for this role, and his dedication to become Lou Bloom can be seen on the screen. This is definitely one of the strongest performances of his career, and that's a lot said when we are talking about actor like Jake Gyllenhaal. Rene Russo also delivers a solid performance in supporting role.What all the people surely get out of this movie is the painting of the mind of a utterly cold sociopath and the coldness and corruption of the sort of news business presented here. However, I'd like to add third aspect here, namely how people lose themselves in their jobs. Been reading lately Deadly Medicines And Organized Crime book by Peter C. Götschze, that introduces the immorality of pharma industry. There the author mentions once that he knows some of the people in industry, and they would never do the stuff they do at job in their pivate lifes. Somehow it seems that when they enter the work, their morale changes completely. And it is quite often, than people who have what you could called green set of values, end up doing job that is harmfull to the environment and against their values, just to state an example.I mean, in this movie, Lou of course doesn't do his legal job very legally. But the point is, that when he goes from the world of crime to the world of legal business, he doesn't go more ethical, but a long way to unethical direction.So, the bad news is not that there're psychopaths among us, but that they are really succesfull in this world. It's not just few individuals that're corrupted, but more like the entire system, that drives people to be even more corrupted, what obviously is presented in this movie."

You know it's wrong, yet you're compelled to watch. Jake Gyllenhaal has made a career out of playing roles in which he stretches the boundaries of what's considered moral.
In this film, all morals are out the window and left very very far behind. He portrays a sociopathic, intelligent but disturbed ""human"" who only sees people as news, nothing more and nothing less.

To top it all off, while this near masterpiece alluded to us as, Nightcrawler, did get nominated for best screenplay, it's plainly evident that it also, should've-beyond the shadow of a doubt-won back in the theatrical goldmine of 2014.First time director, Dan Gilroy, encapsulates the city night skies of Los Angeles spiritedly through a friendless outlook of a calamitously gruesome medium that will infect audiences around the world with trembling fear of the nefarious sides of the human spirit.

" Best LA Film Noir To Date?
",0.6369,0.5483,2019-01-29 00:00:00,10,"When few people we're talking about Nightcrawler, a film that was somewhat initially buried by its release date, I was lamenting that this masterpiece (one of the few American films that have banged my bells in the past decade) barely took home any hardware, while overpriced, badly acted and directed mediocrities were being regularly feted. Well, since the advent of 'fake news' as political jargon that's all changed as the streamers and the dvd crowd has caught up with a film not as shocking to me in its content, but in its level of excellence in almost every category of film making.
Needless to say, Gyllenhaal's noted performance represents the ne plus ultra portrait of the conflicted antagonist as protagonist, no easy feat. The guy is simply one of the best players of his generation, and yet, still remains somehow a bit under the radar, perhaps because he is far more artist than celebrity, unlike others, too numerous to mention.
What does disturb me still however is what I consider to be a general misunderstanding, on the part of the United States of Amnesia's filmgoing public to what the film is really about. First, I do not see Nightcrawler as a psychological study. It is a crime film. But who's buying this stuff? The public.
What Nighcrawler is theme wise is an on point dissection of the horrors of unregulated capitalism and the misguided ethos of of the one-dimensional desperate quest for profit (subsistence in the environment of radically inflated cost of living) as they spill down to the millennial generation through the internet, which becomes almost a character in the narrative, at once Lou's mentor and his alter-ego - like Lear's Fool leading him onto increasingly further depths of depravity in the wasteland of the world of the L.A. night. After all, this is what it takes to establish a successful business, from scratch no less, is it not?
In what is in many opinions the state of the art in scripts, this message is entirely driven home by the subtext in a tale that becomes considerably more than the taut specimen of L.A. Film Noir it presents itself as. Both understated and over-the-top, Nightcrawler deals with some of our most firmly entrenched and divisive social problems at a time when the fabric of our society is severely threatened and does not flinch in its facility for speaking truth to power. A great film, when there are few worth watching."

Gilroy enjoys multi genre blending, splicing bits of horror thriller conventions with satirical barbs pointed at the television based media. Bloom is a frightening character, a sociopath that easily manoeuvres his way around this shifty world, and Gyllenhaal superbly brings him to life. Gaunt (Gyllenhaal lost a lot of weight for the part) with hollow eyes, and spouting management monologues he has learned off of the internet, Bloom only see human misery as a way of making money. Not that TV station editor Nina Romina (Renee Russo) is that much of a better person, and the relationship between the two is troublesome yet dynamic thanks to the excellent script.The look of the picture needed to be atmospherically tight to the thematics at work, and thankfully that is the case. Predominantly set at night, it's all darkness and shadows that in turn are mixed with neon lighted cityscapes and dimmed lamplights. Bloom is at home here, the surroundings match his bents, he has found his calling to a side of the City of Angels which has a fascinating car crash kind of believability to it. The key to it all is that Gilroy and Gyllenhaal rope us viewers in to the point we can't look away, even as Bloom gets worse, morally bankrupt, we are right there with him looking trough his cameras.The relationship between Bloom and his sole employee, Rick (Riz Ahmed) is a little undernourished, but it's a minor complaint. For this is a sharp piece of film making, gloomy of course, but stylish with it, it's also thrilling and deliciously troubling into the bargain. 9/10"

" Great performance from Gyllenhaal
",0.6249,-0.7102,2019-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Really cool setting as you see a rough raw side of Los Angeles and of course with beaches and sunny weather but paired with a somewhat dark sinister story it really works. its a theme that's not been seen before, i can't decide if its a thriller, drama, horror or comedy perhaps a mix of all of them. i really liked Jake Gyllenhaals performance in this you can see how he has prepared for the role especially regarding his weight loss, he portrays a vulture esque displaying bulging eyes and no remorse for what he's doing even his movements remind me of a coyote or wild dog fighting for scraps.its interesting to see that non of the characters in the film really pick up on the fact he is blank and emotionless. I would of liked some more character development but maybe that was the point that he has no story, no family and no friends. could of done with a few more characters for Lou to interact with but who wants to interact with a man like Lou Bloom."
" Gripping Sequences, Tense Interludes
",-0.34,0.7916,2019-01-06 00:00:00,9,"I procrastinated a lot, when it came to watching this movie. I finally did today. In my opinion this is a great film. Given that this review is dated full four years since the movie was released , it would be farcical to pen down a detailed opinion on the more obvious aspects of the movie, such as , Jake Gyllenhaal's excellent performance or the lucid writing of Mr. Gilroy. Hence, I shall focus on the aspects that may prove adulatory to the direction of the movie.Given its fairly straightforward and no frills story-line, the director does a stupendous job in creating a gripping thriller. There is something reticent about the pace of the movie. However, the movie is very tense. The director has exploited the situational plot brilliantly, creating characters and sequences that keep one on the edge.This tension, that lingers in the background and slowly grows on screen, is given an explicit expression in a powerful scene where the lead character exhibits frustration before a bathroom mirror.The lead character has a menacing presence in the movie, because the character walks on the edge . There is not a single scene where one does not fear that he may lose control and not a single scene where the audience can relax due to predictability.Mr. Gilroy's other ventures have not been quite as gripping as this movie. The credit of course has to be shared with Mr. Gyllenhaal who may have rendered a post modern image of the eponymous creature.Unlike a few other thrillers, one can watch this film repeatedly because the suspense it holds is not just confined to sequences but also to the interludes."

The movie starts pretty well, making the viewers feel pretty simpathetic with the protagonist role. Im trying not to leave any spoilers here, so i cant really talk much about the main character, but i can say that overall the lacks of ethics from the movie istlef is really disapointing. Now, one can say that the movie could be a critic of society and the media, but is not the case. The movie lacks from reallity big time, presenting a die hard antihero living a fantasy. Really bad taste to end up as some sort of gore encourage."

" A sinister masterpiece
",0.0516,0.7389,2018-12-01 00:00:00,9,"Is this a thriller or a character study of a sociopath? If it was either one of the two it would've been a very good film - either an awe inducing ride (thriller) or an interesting portrayal of the lengths a human being might go to for personal advancement (character study). In fact, it was both, which, for me made it a sinister masterpiece. Jake Gylennhall is Lou, an aspiring 'nightcrawler' (shoot and sell newsworthy video for a price) who will go to extreme lengths to perfect his art and, at the same time, increase his bargaining power. Riz Ahmed is his 'intern', who wants a financial break. To say much more would spoil it - but an absolute masterclass in genre dividing film. I've now seen it 3 times and get more out of it each time. 9 out of ten"
" Incredible and subversive of my expectations
",-0.2263,0.9879,2018-12-01 00:00:00,9,This film is incredible. It's a relatively straight forward script but in no way cliche. The interesting manipulative character is made more intriguing by gyllenhal's fantastic performance. All of the acting is superb most notably gyllenhal and Riz Amed. The direction that the story goes in is very shocking at times and the few action scenes also make this film very entertaining and thrilling for someone who is just interested in having fun with this film. I appreciate how this film isn't littered with subtext and still shows that you can make a unique and interesting film without trying to force in ideas and themes
" Who is our main character?
",0.0,0.9937,2018-11-27 00:00:00,7,"I always thought main characters needed a fair amount of background information so we can identify with them better and thus making our movie experience way more enjoyable. However, this one here doesn't give us much. We have a burglar. A burgler who is a rational, win and success-oriented psychopath who piece by piece gets what he wants simply by being a ""quick learner"". We don't know why he is like that in the first place. We don't know why, for example, he didn't use his creative energy and his seemingly unlimited ambition and work ethic to get a decent and well-payed job; did he go to university? did he even finish school? where did he get his brainpower from? just by reading stuff in books or online? For some reason, the writers do not want to give us this information. Maybe we don't need to know it, but I think it could've helped occasionally, because every antihero / villain has a specific reason why he or she developed into the monster that they are now which can make certain notions relatable. All in all, the character Lou doesn't develop much throughout this movie, and usually, this is essential. Lou gets people killed for his own benefit. But we don't know if he hasn't done that before, so we can't really tell if he is developing or not. Yes, he fails at the beginning of his job and succeeds at the end but he never changes his attitude, he doesn't develop personally. To me, this is a little problematic, HOWEVER, I think Jake Gyllenhall plays his part brilliantly and the idea of the story is just fantastic. How far would you go for the perfect image / video material? I also liked how his situation within the storyline successively escalates: 1. Move dead body for the sake of a better shot, 2. Manipulate the car of his opponent causing an accident, 3. Actually stage a crime scene and be there before anything happens. ... so that is all great! I liked the cinematography as well, they really managed to build up thrilling scenes of high suspense by matching form and content. 7/10... Apperantly, movies can work without much background information on their main character. There are probably even tons of good movies that do that and I'm not even aware of it yet. I personally don't like that, though :) still a good movie to me because of anything else"

Most of the suspense comes from wondering just how far Bloom will go to succeed. This movie exposes a world of voyeuristic vultures running around recording other people's pain for profit. Plus, it is also a commentary on the ratings-hungry media as well as those who consume it. This is a well-crafted film."

",0.4927,0.8461,2018-10-25 00:00:00,8,"Enjoyed this thoroughly, really interesting movie with themes of addiction and how someone can become so engrossed in something. This is probably Jake Gyllenhal's best performance I've seen (maybe tied with Jarhead maybe in my opinion), he played the creepy sociopath brilliantly. Everyone scene he was in the character just gave me chills, he's so bloomin weird. It's a sort of a slow burner and you have to be invested in it, it's not a high action or drama or anything. But it certainly keeps your attention with all the crazy stuff the character is doing. This movie is not really talked about that much and is underrated, it's not perfect don't know why just feels like somethings missing. Overall I would highly recommend it if you have the chance, I was just bored and saw it on Netflix (U.K.)"

Choosing a character and turning into that character is no issue for him, and Nightcrawler proves that. The one thing I can appreciate from this film is the story itself. Nightcrawler is original. It follows a topic that really isn't explored in film and does it really well. Nightcrawler is a perfect ""what goes on behind close doors"" in modern society, and just an awesome entertaining film overall. 9/10"
" Nightcrawler Review
",0.0,0.9556,2018-09-24 00:00:00,9,"Nightcrawler is a dramatic, crime thriller directed by Dan Gilroy. The film follows Lou Bloom (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a man desperate for work, as he enters into the business of filming crime scenes for money. Nightcrawler's director Dan Gilroy does a fantastic job at both creating a unique character, Lou Bloom, and then showing this character off to the audience. It becomes abundantly clear in the first 20 minutes of the film what kind of person Lou Bloom is and how he's going to carry himself throughout the rest of the film. The film strongly emphasizes the manipulative, sociopathic qualities of Lou Bloom. This clear characterization of Lou Bloom is what makes Nightcrawler so entertaining to watch. Transparency is a clear theme to this film. Dan Gilroy wants the audience to see the characters, setting, and mood of his film for what the really are. There is no confusion about the character's motives or personality, the setting, and mood of the film. A lot of the characters themselves reinforce this theme. Lou Bloom is clear about his objective and will not sugarcoat anything. The story captures and holds the attention of the audience from the very start of the film to the ending credits sequence. Two of the most apparent ways that Gilroy has created this interesting story have been through action. There is both a mixture of physical and psychological action. There is a duality of action throughout Nightcrawler. The physical action scenes compliment Lou Bloom's psychological changes. Bloom progressively does more and more risky things to get more money. Through his physical actions it can be seen that he is also changing psychologically. Dan Gilroy also employs suspense to maintain the maintain the audience's interest in the film. The story portrays Lou Bloom as a risk taker. What separates this story's risk taker from other risk takers is how quickly Bloom's risks escalate. His risks exponentially become even riskier to the point where a viewer is wondering ""What will he do next?"" This risk taking nature of the film adds a ton of suspense as Bloom arrives at each crime. ""What will he do this time to make more money?"" are the questions that come across a viewer's mind throughout the whole film. His risks reflect his apparent lack of morality, which allow him to not care about his well-being or the well-being of others. 
The film has a clear structure which makes for a more enjoyable viewing experience. The film follows a linear approach to telling a story. The three acts which are: exposition, complication, and climax, are very apparent in the film. The first act, exposition, introduces Lou, the main character, and the people he works with. Their characters personalities and motives are clear. The film does great job of putting these characters, along with their traits, in positions that make sense to the audience. The next act, complication, introduces a conflict and grows that conflict. The conflict is clear and so is its importance to the story. The final act, climax, is the highest point of emotional action in the film. At this point, the story's tension, mainly regarding the conflict, are so high that the audience can feel it. The viewers know that something big is going to happen, but they don't know what. This brings suspense back into the film. Overall Nightcrawler does a great job at holding the attention of the viewer and it provides an very interesting and unique story. Jake Gyllenhaal did an amazing job at becoming a character that is almost villainous but like-able at the same time. This movie is a much watch for those who are into films that are suspenseful and dramatic."
" Fantastic Satire and Character Study
",0.5574,0.9953,2018-09-17 00:00:00,9,"Dan Gilroy brings us an amazingly well-executed satire and character study. Let me preface this by saying, if you get information from a single media outlet (mainly Fox news) you will not enjoy this film. To start, this movie always has the main character in mind, whether it be the cinematography, the score, or the performance, you're essentially seeing the movie made by Louis. A couple examples are the depth of field is sometimes manipulated to change what the focus of the character is, at first chatter on a police scanner and then a restaurant across the street. The most hilarious example of this is the score, the track that plays when the main character is taking pictures of a fatal car crash what plays is the most cookie cutter cheesy scattered percussion and clarinet as if it's some kind of triumphant moment for the main character. That's just not something you see a lot and I appreciate it. Jake Gyllenhaal does a phenomenal job as the main character, I never once believed he wasn't the character he was portraying, he brings very subtle yet delightfully blunt nuances to his performance. Rene Russo did a pretty good job, I don't think she was given an amazing amount of material to work with like Jake but I did feel she was giving about 65%, it wasn't noticeably bad but not miraculously outstanding, it didn't really affect the movie or my experience but it's worth noting. The political aspect of the film I think was executed amazingly, there was one line that was so on the nose I rolled my eyes but that's one line. I liked the role the internet played in the film, however, I wished there wasn't the bootleg google 'search' and I would've really appreciated they used a real editing software like sony vegas or windows movie maker, something cheap or free. Despite some of the small things that bothered me it's a fantastic movie, go watch it, it's great, tell ya friends, tell ya chilldans, get your pet to watch it with you, guaranteed fun time, no refunds. After the second watch, I'm confident in giving this a 9/10."

I heard the reputation that the main character is a scratch, but it was painful with plenty of scratches that did not disappoint.It was a terribly distorted success story, and the tempo was also good and I was not bored. It is amazing how this is the first director work.Jake Gillen Hall's facial power was amazing, but character shaping was superb. Although I do not feel like a person with a disorder as I see it, I thought that I do not want to engage with him from the moment when it appeared in an atmosphere that was difficult to approach.It is a person who can only think about relationships with people in the interests and become increasingly high pressure even when talking. There was a scene that spit long lines seriously with one cut at once and it got nailed.

" A gruelling journey
",0.0,-0.0497,2018-09-07 00:00:00,8,"NIGHTCRAWLER is an engaging, ever-so-dark character study/thriller which explores the subject of voyeurism - particularly the very human, rubber-necking trait of becoming obsessed by murders, crime, accidents and bloodshed. This atypical, fresh-feeling film plays out in an inventive way, inviting the viewer to go on a heart-of-darkness style journey alongside a gaunt and frightening Jake Gyllenhaal, doing his obsessed thing again after ZODIAC and even less human this time around. What transpires is ghoulishly entertaining, featuring strong supporting turns from Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed as others along for the ride, building to a quietly devastating climax. I could have done with the character work a little more grey rather than so explicitly black and white, especially at the slightly contrived climax, but otherwise this is well made stuff."

Thankfully, Dan Gilroy leads us effortlessly through this slick flick about a not-so-good guy doing the best he can to survive, played excellently by Jake Gyllenhaal in an Oscar worthy performance.

" Gyllenhaal is perfect in this dark, intensely focused thriller
",0.8059,0.9828,2018-08-15 00:00:00,8,"Nightcrawler is an extreme example of a narrowly focused character drama: we don't get backstory on Bloom or much detail on the people and events outside of Bloom. Even in studying Bloom, we only see him in action; Gilroy doesn't spend any time showing the time Bloom puts in to prepare for being an independent filmer, it's all shown in his practiced knowledge of minor details and robotic explanations of successful companies. It works extremely well as a character study, as we clearly see Bloom's willingness to do anything to succeed and cold calculation with other people. It did feel a little too easy for him in many regards. His entrance into the industry was surprisingly smooth for someone with zero background experience, and his success with the news company seemed unlikely. His personal threats never came back to bite him, and he somehow never got caught despite his absurdly risky plays on crime scenes. I would imagine the police would be far more aggressive in investigating him than they were; both he and the news company didn't get nearly as much flack as they deserved. Nevertheless, Nightcrawler absolutely keeps you engrossed the entire time and is a fantastic character study of a sociopathic, aggressive main character played in one of the great recent acting performances from the man at the top of the game."

",0.7684,-0.8667,2018-07-12 00:00:00,6,"There's not much to say about the story of Nightcrawler. If it rises to the category of satire, as many of the reviewers here think, it's hardly original in attacking TV news for featuring crime and blood as a way to boost their ratings. That's been done a hundred times, and often much better than this. Most of the action consists of a guy rushing up to a n accident or crime scene and pushing his way into the chaos to get video footage. Not much of that sticks in your memory.The movie's one saving grace is the driven, manipulative insanity of the main character. Gyllenhaal has a gleam in his eye that, even in the quietest moments, makes it clear that this guy, for all his attempts to charm people, is crazy and dangerous. There are plenty of time-wasters worse than this.The writers deserve special credit for one scene. The main character's attempt over dinner in a Mexican restaurant to seduce the woman who's in charge of buying his videos is so wacky, so remote from any normal relationship, that it's humorous at the same time that it's appalling. There the dialogue carries the scene on its own, and Gyllenhaal doesn't have much to do beyond speaking the lines."
" That freaking complex psychologically written psychopath! Wow!
",0.3786,0.9276,2018-06-28 00:00:00,8,"Nightcrawler is one of the movies that is on the blacklist of the academy for the most awesome movies that they don't appreciate it by
nominating it to that number of Oscars it deserves. As for this movie it really should have been nominated for 6 more Oscars and giving a guaranteed one to Jake for his Physically, mentally and Psychologically prepared Performance with his stable reactions that gave with the scenario that both shocking and creepy feeling for the character and made it so realistic to the audience. The movie had too many things that made it look that good , In my opinion, one of them is presenting the character in it's early starts and putting him in different situations that made you both sympathetic with and shocked at him.
The screenplay that was perfectly written for the character that added to it mentally and psychologically and made you feel with Jake's performance that you have just a complete character with it's lack of feelings in front of you on screen. The music of the movie was good too and makes you feel intense and excited in some scenes but it's presence lacked in the end. The story
is very good and it's characters are good but some other characters weren't either written well or performed well as the female FBI agent. Disn't feel Riz Ahmed or hia character that I found is a helping reason for some incidents and not the goos type and the ending scene was fake for him.
The story's only problem I fell it was the sequence where we were infront of many actions and presenting the character then stopping for the big action in the end that made you feel too much lunacy and strange stable reactions and discovering his mean self that only puts his benefit at first even on other people's lives which made me a little bit bored that we are getting deeper and deeper into showing his psychopathic character.

",0.7184,0.9928,2018-06-27 00:00:00,10,"There are a lot of elements to consider when categorising a movie as perfect. This movie is personally what I think to be one of the most original, well shot and directed, and of course well acted films I've ever seen. On my first watch I had no idea what I was getting into, and by the point of climax I was left astounded. There's not much to be said without giving away a lot of the movie so this'll have to be kept brief in terms of plot.It has to be said that Jake Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar worthy performance in this film, and it's so very tempting to give the film a rating of 10 for this alone. His character is portrayed with so much ambition, desperation, assertion, I could go on. He is literally gripping in this movie and I'm now persistent in watching him in previous and forthcoming roles. His character is the sole foundation of the plot and many of the themes and morals derive from himself. Riz Ahmed should also not go unmentioned due to an exceptional supporting role. I sometimes felt like his character somewhat serves as a vessel for the audience, which I noticed when seeing his reactions to events and actions caused by others throughout the story.Like I said the story is one of the most original I've ever seen, and so interesting. The film constantly has you guessing who the protagonist and antagonist are, which I find is smart. You're also always wondering how far certain characters will go to achieve their goals, the extreme decisions made certainly live up to the thriller theme of the film. The way characters behave throughout the story actually remind me of Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White in Breaking Bad. The way the line of morality and villainy are crossed is excellently depicted. While the plot moves forward, each chapter is bigger than the last giving a true sense of escalation, and giving you a reason to stick around till the end.This movie wouldn't be complete without it's character's playground that is nighttime Los Angeles in all its darkness. I mean that physically and metaphorically. This is definitely a dark film, and the director perfectly captures that through violent crime, and the corrupted news stations that report it. The darkness works in favour of the tone of the film, and gives it a noir like feel which is a nice touch. Another cool thing I took away from the movie was an insight into the industry of cameramen and how assertive they have to be in that line of business in order to not only tell a story, but to earn a living.Nightcrawler to me is a great example of a flawless movie. It isn't action packed and not every scene is suspenseful, though thanks to such Oscar worthy acting and greatly written dialogue the film never feels slow or boring. The film is insightful and interesting yet retains it's noir, crime and thriller aspects which all work in harmony. The characters feel real and grounded, and any interaction main star Jake Gyllenhaal has with anyone is captivating. If you're looking for a small scale film with a character driven plot and many great qualities, then Nightcrawler is a perfect candidate."
" A Must Watch Movie!
",0.0,-0.5553,2018-05-22 00:00:00,9,"Nightcrawler is a tense, dark and deeply cynical movie about a man who videotapes roadside accidents and sells them to a local news station- but this is just the gist of it. The film becomes uncomfortable at times and the entire mood is somber and nihilistic. Featuring a fantastic turn by Jake Gyllenhaal who continues to prove he is one of the finest actors of this generation and ably supported by Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed Nightcrawler is too cynical to appeal to mainstream audiences. However, if you want a compelling character study then this Dan Gilroy (his first film as a director) film is a must watch."
" A dark thriller with an excellent sense of tone and a riveting central character study.
",0.6249,0.9607,2018-05-16 00:00:00,8,"'Nightcrawler (2014)' is a dark thriller with an excellent sense of tone, with occasional black humour serving mostly to emphasise the bleakness of its central arc. This beautifully shot feature is a fantastic look into the mind of a sociopath, with the transformation from protagonist to, arguably, antagonist being constantly engaging and essentially unique. It's this downward spiral and the charisma of the character that keep you in your seat, though the news-based narrative is remarkably riveting in its own right. It's a wonderfully assured - and, frankly, ballsy - character study. 8/10"

He already showed us his talent frequently. But as the psycho Louis Bloom he was just impressive. In every second he puts this charakter his stamp on. I would even go that far to say, Bloom is one of the best antiheroes i have ever seen. I'm looking forward to Gyllenhall's future projects. If he can keep this level rudimentary, the academy has no other chance to honor this man.
Also sensational was the directing debut from Dan Gilroy. The tight production, the interesting design of LA as well as the pleasant music were a very good combination. I'm curious what we will see from this man in the future. Confessedly the tension of this story from the sensationalism and a guy who knows to exploit that is limited after the time, but this movie makes the best of it and achieves to watch this film more times. It is rare to give a movie more than 7 points, but a great Gyllenhall and the good complete work made it possible."

Going to ever increasing lengths to capture car crashes, fires, murder and mayhem 'Lois' eventually films the aftermath of a violent home invasion, the resulting police investigation threatens to turn deadly.Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing in this; gaunt, brilliant, obsessed, slightly Rainman-ish and crazy. Even the way his character walks is unique. This was also a different story than I'd ever seen before which is so refreshing in this day of endless remakes, CGI fests and superhero movies. I was also impressed with Rene Russo as 'Nina' the news director who mentors Lois, welcoming his grisly crime photo footage as a chance to raise her station's ratings. Their relationships really shows Lois' rise to power. Bill Paxton has a small role as a fellow nightcrawler.Will watch this one again."

But it contains so many things that are simply not believable, it ultimately fails.Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job portraying a creepy/weird guy who decides to become a video news reporter. But people like him make other people want to run away, not grant them full access to whatever they want!After getting some closeup images of a few accidents, which he is able to sell to a local news station that is desperate for ratings, he begins to think that he is Edward R. Murrow and starts making demands. The problem I have with this is that in greater LA, the idea that for any one incident he might not be as much as an hour away, means that *no one* could guarantee that they would be able to get these videos regularly. It would not matter what your journalism skills might be. Yet the movie shows him essentially holding up the news station as if he could guarantee these types of results.Next, every time he arrives at a crash or fire, there are no other cars backed up. He drives right up to the actual scene! Next, although a few police tell him to get back, in the real world, he would never be able to do what he does in the movie! Next, when he goes in to the scene of the supposed home invasion, which he heard about on the police scanner, and spends 5 minutes there before the police get there is not believable. Once the police find out, it is not believable that he would not be put under interrogation for 12 hours... instead he just makes some glib remarks and walks out. Any true police show like ""The First 48"" will show you how wrong this is.Finally, the idea that the police know he set up the final scene where the policeman is shot, and that he is just able to go on about his life as a news moguls is ridiculous.Maybe it is because I am a true crime buff that this made me so crazy, but if you watch this, you will see what I mean. I would not recommend it.Finally,"

",-0.34,0.1804,2018-02-06 00:00:00,8,"An enormously vivid movie that actually has something important and relevant to say. Gyllenhaal is superbly convincing as an egregiously awful human/hyena hybrid, while Russo shines as his more polished but equally dangerous enabler. All through the movie I kept hoping for some poetic justice : if there ever was a character who deserved a bullet through the spleen or a collision with a burning truck, it was Lou Bloom. Upon reflection the movie's ending is better. Bloom thrives and is about to divide and multiply himself into infinity, like cancer cells. A cautionary tale about the consequences and side-effects of our desire for ever more shocking and intrusive news footage."

How often do we see news reports that are nothing more than opinions because they don't have enough or any facts to report. It has moments of humour, our anti hero is trying to live the American dream based on some online business course. Problem being he treats life & everyone as a business deal, some of which is very funny. But then it raises the question have we forgotten morality and decency in a pursuit of wealth.

",0.0714,0.9513,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Nightcrawler' is unfortunately not a standalone film of the X-Men's cheeky elf character, but rather a dark exposition of modern news and the public's (apparent) bloodlust. The film has a simple premise - Bloom (Gyllenhaal) and his partner, Rick (Ahmed) listen to the police scanner and try to show up at accidents to film the gory aftermath before the cops can stop them or before they're beaten to the scene by other competitors. They're literally trawling the night for news-worthy footage. That this 'needs' to be ""bloody"", as Bloom clarifies with Nina (Russo) at the news station is either an indictment on TV news stations/shows, or the public in general - or possibly a bit of both.Gyllenhaal is very captivating as the main star, being in basically every scene and using his huge eyes - and gross mini-ponytail - to creep you out. You don't hate him, but start to fully comprehend what a psychopath he is as the film progresses. Sure, he doesn't kill anyone himself, but he certainly does some despicable things and has no remorse and you start to truly despise him - which proves how good he's acting!Ahmed, Russo & Paxton are good in small, but significant roles. The soundtrack is solid and the cinematography of Los Angeles make sit actually look hospitable and attractive for a change - not as gritty as I would've expected in a movie of this tone. Good ending to the film, if a disappointing one to watch."

However, a man survives, triumphs and it is when he loses his rational human behavior and his ambitions become exacerbated. Love does not exist, only a superficial one in order to satisfy even more his ambitions. Excellent acting of Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo and a London-born director-actor Riz Ahmed.

He also keeps his cool for most of the film and says kinda brutal stuff in that calm voice, making it sound more effective. The movie shows the lengths to which journalists go to (i.e. invading crime scenes) get stories and money. On top of that, Bloom (Gyllenhaal's character) is severely apathetic. Gyllenhaal definitely performed well as a desperate man turned desperado (in a way). This was also a rather simple movie (low budget, good performances and writing) and I like that (I hate overspending and then losing a ton of money). The music also fit the situations nicely, especially the montage of Bloom filming crime scenes, downloading video files and buying stuff (that particular bit was smooth and not too loud). Riz Ahmed (THE PILOT from Rogue One) later comes in and also fits his role as Rick, another desperate man, quite well - not having a lot of dialogue, but still having enough for people and Bloom to understand him. His California accent is also suitable. This movie's story is entertaining (proven by a nomination for Best Original Screenplay) and it's fun to see how much Bloom controls his world and the people around him, through whatever means necessary. I think my only criticism is Bloom's personal history not really being explained. Nonetheless, this movie's damn good."

A linear script, which contains some difficulties in guiding its acts and abuses at various climax, but what is necessary to take the monotony. Telling the story of Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man with an immense penchant and an insatiable desire to win in life, with difficulties of getting a job and living from petty thefts, he discovers a new market, selling accident videos And murders on local television channels, such a market becomes Lous's obsession, which does everything to stand out and does not put any effort or scruples. We can not judge so much Louis, a man with ambition and desire to overcome insatiable, we can not judge his work or even his coldness, only his crimes can be judged, the biggest villains are the public itself indulging in a basic human curiosity, Morbid curiosity, this interest generates the market that generates interest in exploiting it, this is a trade, and the criticism of the film is precisely on top of that, the despair of the television channels in selling death, and the little concern to understand or help Victims, what counts is the exploitation of its disgrace. The film has an extremely urban photograph, at times it remembers the great ""Drive"", with a palette of colors that always strives to emphasize the night, a good sound mix and a basic but competent assembly, the soundtrack is discreet, but When it appears, she talks to Louis, and the film seeks not to sell violence, other than the same shows, this is interesting, as it seeks to reach the public with its quality rather than pure appeal. The biggest highlight of the film for me is Jake Gyllenhaal, an actor who completely embodied himself for the movie, losing I0 kilos, not flashing, and even the way of walking is different, Jake is incredible, with a sociopathic face and really looking like A vulture, he completely steals the scene, not just the scene, the whole movie, you feel the desperation in his eyes, the despair of anyone who would do anything to achieve their goal, Jake makes the best performance of his career.

Jake is usually just too darn likable, and thus might seem unsuitable for the evil lead in pic. However, Jake rose to challenge by masterfully playing his character against-type, as a chillingly sociopathic, ruthlessly upwardly mobile wannabe video news stringer. (An appropriately applicable definition of Hollywood/L.A. is that it is ""The place where you become what you pretend to be."")Jake reportedly lost nearly thirty pounds to play the gaunt, soulless, Mephistophelean petty criminal, Louis Bloom, who accidentally stumbles on an exciting way to earn instant cash from TV stations: by videotaping on-scene police activity and bloody accidents. Jake figures out early on that he needs a police radio call ""scanner"" to find the action. He later barges into a local TV station during night hours, and discovers a ready TV market in Rene Russo, playing a desperate, over-the-hill, graveyard-shift news director looking for gory, ratings-pumping news stories.Jake ""hires"" a naive rube for as assistant to cover the police calls and give him lightning driving directions t calls through the streets of L.A. The goal is to be first on the scene, get the video shot, then hotfoot the footage to the station for a hopefully exclusive airing on the news. Jake pays the assistant practically nothing, but salves him with ongoing promotional ""titles,"" such as Vice-President (of apparently nothing, as far as a real company is concerned). When the assistant wises up and demands a large share of the sale of a major news story, Jake schemes to eliminate his now-troublesome assistant by setting him up to become part of the news himself in an impromptu but lethal final assignment. Director Dan Gilroy's earthly, noir-like photography of the L.A. streets is shot almost totally at night. Gilroy captures the ever-present juxtaposition of the saccharine West L.A. affluence and the searingly dangerous underbelly of the L.A./Hollywood scene.Truly riveting, entertaining, and best of all, pic does not suffer from the typical ""Hollywood Ending"" that has ruined many films.

Gyllenhaal's physical transformation into the gaunt and creepy Louis who never, ever wants to be called Lou is impressive as well. The criticism of the media and its persistent focus on ""nice"" people getting hurt is well-done, even given its lack of subtlety. The cinematography is well-done, and Louis's progressively nicer vehicles are shot like a wild animal stalking the streets of LA. Riz Ahmed also does a fantastic job as Louis's much put upon subordinate. An overall solid film.(I saw this most recently on June 1, 2017.)"

Ironically, many of the things he teaches himself to do are things a therapist would advise, usually to no avail.Margeret Mead had a theory that different societies favored different personality types, although the individuals in those societies would still show the usual range of personality type. This movie is a bildungs roman of a man learning how to fit his pathology into a perverted society where antisocial personality disorder with something mild on the Asperger's spectrum gives him advantages. It isn't just the news room, either. An internet that encourages people to manipulate their way to personal power fits him like a glove. The role of lieing in his psychology and the psychology of a certain prominent con artist makes this a truly relevant movie, powerfully prophetic. No, I am not thinking about Martin Shkreli, but I could be. A number of studies have shown that as people gain personal power their empathetic function diminishes, and we live in a time when that dynamic is being normalised and politicized. I wanted to see this movie because the trailers reminded me of an ex- boyfriend. This person had a highly developed empathetic function and took care of everyone around him, as in making sure they had a place to sleep and something to eat, because those were the people who were his friends. The earnest literalism, the manic energy, even facial expressions continued to remind me of my friend for the whole movie. Ironically, he had been a man with a plan that was going to keep him firmly in the middle class, when he decided that he didn't want to be that person and reorganized his life so he could hangout and help people he liked. In a world flooded with movies about evil falling from the sky or popping out of a box, this is a real movie about real evil."

" "" I'd like to think if you're seeing me you're having the worst day of your life. "" – Louis Bloom.
",-0.3818,0.991,2017-05-19 00:00:00,10,"But I'd like to say that if you're seeing him in that movie, you're having the best day of your life (or weekend at least). And you'll scream your lungs out with these words: What exactly the f*ck is up with the folks at the Academy? Good Ol' Jake never gets his nod at the Oscars unless he's Broken-some-backs?""Nightcrawler(s)"" is a term for freelance cameramen, seen here roaming LA after dark in search of lurid stories to sell to TV: as the dictum goes: ""If it bleeds, it leads.""Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a venturesome beginner who demonstrates appallingly great at the exchange, being completely committed and hyper-composed, with the moral second thoughts of a moray eel.The experiences about the ethical opportunity of TV news are not really novel, yet what gives Nightcrawler its class is Gyllenhaal's alarming, now and then coldly comic execution as the beguiled screw- up, always vacantly gushing certifiable administration manual talk. Yet, underneath the enthusiastic beaver brilliance is a non domesticated soul, showed up – oil slicked hair, the thinness of a sleep deprived person austere and a glare that appears to be painted on to his eyelids, as though Lou is a recording gadget for all time exchanged on.There's solid support from Riz Ahmed as Lou's hapless en-roll, however the genuine shock is a show-taking Rene Russo as Nina, a hard- nibbled news manager on the falling flat station that offers Lou his reprieve. In an uncommon scene, Lou welcomes her to supper, consults for better terms and, as a major issue, demands this extensively more established lady laying down with him; the enthusiastic (and oedipal) fencing between the two is awfully convincing.Mental extravagance aside, Nightcrawler works adequately as an incline thriller, with the city night given a cool, metallic sheen by cinematographer Robert Elswit. It may not be pivotal, but rather Nightcrawler emerges as an appreciated peculiarity today, reviewing the kind of harsh dramatisations once made by executives, for example, Michael Mann, Sidney Lumet or James B Harris. Gilroy marginally blows it with a group satisfying climactic pursue, yet this is an appropriately grown-up excitement; and it contains the most critical new beast in sight, being the most miserably human.Louis Bloom is pretty much pure evil. Worse than that, he is the kind of pure evil that you might expect to find living right next door to you. Though ultimately just a man, Bloom has long abandoned any semblance of humanity in favour of pursuing any venture that will benefit him and him alone.This philosophy eventually attracts Bloom to the world of paparazzi-style news recording.The worst part is that ""Nightcrawler"" leads us to believe that Bloom will ultimately get his in the end, but that doesn't prove to be the case. At all. Instead, we come to find that Bloom will not only avoid prosecution for his various crimes, but that he's found himself a very profitable place in the world of violent news reporting. Things could not have gone better for this madman."
" The Subject Was Poses

Gilroy, who enjoyed a hit on Broadway in 1965 with his play The Subject Was Roses, and adapted it for the screen successfully in 1968. That's about the only link between the two properties but Dan Gilroy is to be commended for writing and directing an original in his first At Bat. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the seriously weird character who starts as a con man and morphs into a freelance ghoul who, armed with a movie camera, car and a police scanner, makes a handsome living cruising Los Angeles in search of muggings, robberies and other assorted crimes, the gorier the better, which he films as they are happening and then sells the footage to a TV station. Gilroy's wife, Rene Russo, is equally compelling as the TV producer who encourages Gyllenhaal to become more vulturelike by the day. A brilliant but soiled film."

Jake Gyllenhaal is a great one for off-kilter films, and this one little disappoints.What we have here is one of the most amoral characters we have seen on screen for many a year (Lou portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal), who finds a niche to ambulance chase crime scenes to film graphic moments and sell on to a local news agency without any regard for the victims or the circumstances. The lead character is robotic in his manner, and even though we see him at the start as a criminal we surprisingly see him manage to sink lower. He will do anything to reach his goals, and it's often an uncomfortable watch.Rene Russo as a news lead for the media company is fabulous as we see her character find herself trapped in Lou's plans, and their interaction is thought provoking. Lou is the freelance news gatherer who will stamp over everyone in his path.This film is all about having a stab at many items: the media glorying crime porn for ratings, the insatiable demand from the public feeding off this and the graphic crime that is the fuel for this craze.You will still be thinking about this grim dark film long after. It is at times darkly humorous too, but it's not an easy one to digest.A very timely movie, but we are already aware of the issues, but the grim reality there is little we can do unless the demand is quelled. It's a grim realisation that we come to conclude after watching this."
" Taxi Driver was a one-off. Stop trying to copy it Hollywood parasites
",-0.296,-0.5446,2017-05-07 00:00:00,1,"I started out watching this, thinking the 3am atmosphere would be interesting to show how this weirdo character gets to stake his claim in the world. As it WORE on, it more or less glorified the aforementioned weirdo as a pragmatist and the ending was a kick in the king tuts.How many times have we seen Taxi Driver pastiches where the socio/ psycho/ schizo etc has a plan that comes to fruition? The greatest thing about Taxi Driver is we realize the main character doesn't know what he's doing. Bickle is fickle. Flitting from romance, to politics, to social conscience, back to politics. This seems like a better way to describe the thinking of someone who has lost touch with reality.Nightcrawler, however is too much A to B and left me with an uneasy feeling that sick-minded people go unnoticed so long as they do well for themselves. This is untrue. Sick-minded people may well do okay for themselves, but they always leave a wake of clues that others will remember as 'worse than odd' and make it their business to then avoid them at all costs."
" Jake Gyllenhaal excels as a sociopathic freelance cameraman
",0.6908,-0.9744,2017-05-07 00:00:00,9,"Louis Bloom is a low level thief in Los Angeles until one day he stops because of a car crash. Here he sees a freelance cameraman filming the aftermath. Louis asks why he is filming such a thing and is told that local news stations pay top dollar for such footage the grizzlier the better. He sells some stolen property to buy a cheap video camera and police scanner. At the first potential story he attends the police tell him to leave because he is getting to close; but he has the footage and sells it to a local TV station. News director Nina Romina tells him that she is impressed by his work and that he should bring any more stories to her. Soon his footage is appearing on screen regularly; as time passes he buys better equipment and takes on an assistant, who he pays a pittance. He frequently goes too far; entering properties and even moving a body at a car crash to get a better shot but that is only the start. What he is prepared to do to get a story escalates till one day he hears a message about a home invasion in a well-to-do area; he is minutes away and not only gets there before the police arrive but also before the criminals have left; he films the villains as they flee then enters the house and films the victims; three dead people. The footage in the house is aired but he holds back footage that shows the killers he wants to make sure that he has their arrest on camera; preferably in a public place.This is a darkly comic film with a protagonist who is clearly a sociopath; he may not be as obviously psychotic as American Psycho's Patrick Bateman but he is clearly cut from the same cloth. Jake Gyllenhaal is on brilliant form as Bloom; he makes the character entirely believable in a world where violence dominates the news; not foreign wars but murder and accidents in affluent Los Angeles it is made clear early on that poor, non-white victims barely count in this macabre ratings war. He is ably supported by Rene Russo who plays Nina, a character who is more than willing to sacrifice morals for ratings and Riz Ahmed, who plays Bloom's assistant Rick; the closest the film has to a moral character. While this isn't really an action film there are still exciting moments; most notably a really good car chase in the film's closing scenes as Bloom and Rick film the police chasing after the killers as high speed. Given the sort of footage Bloom is after it is of no surprise that there are some fairly gory moments as we see the aftermath of violent events. Overall I'd recommend this although I would point out that it certainly won't be for everybody thanks to its amoral protagonist and the subject matter."
" Truly amazing that... (mild spoiler)
",0.7717,0.9493,2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"I find it truly amazing that Jake Gyllenhaal did not win nor was even nominated for an Oscar for this stunning performance as Louis Bloom. Makes me wonder how much of who gets nominated and who wins rides on insider politics and not on merit. Or how many Oscar noms and wins are ""gifts"" in the respect that either an actor has a catalog of wonderful performances and has never won (Henry Fonda comes to mind for ""On Golden Pond"")or the effort put into as role somehow makes it an Oscar winning performance (Leo DiCaprio in ""The Revenant"").Gyllenhaal becomes his character; a feral, single minded, means justify the end ""bottom feeder"" catering to the worst in humanity - our seemingly built in need to view others pain. He sees nothing at all wrong with what he does or how he goes about it. Easily he is most believable sociopath I have seen on film. In a performance marked by many stand out moments perhaps the most galvanizing one is not an action sequence but a quiet moment (before a storm) where he tells an employee that ""Maybe my problem isn't that I don't understand people, but that I don't like them.""How his work was over looked for an Oscar is beyond what good acting warrants and indeed must fall within the machinery of Hollywood backroom politics. Going by IMDb, he was nominated for outstanding acting by just about every other award given in entertainment except the Academy. Maybe perhaps his Lou Bloom was too good and looking at this work, for Hollywood, was like looking into the darkest darkness; understanding the reflection they saw in it was themselves."

It gives you a sense of unsettling and tense feel as the film starts introducing us to the main character, Louis Bloom(Jake Gyllenhaal). He is a person who is well educated, appreciated, however, one who is professional acting nice and showing signals of appreciation, as it differs in the inside of himself. He lives an unusual life, a thief who always wonders to find a career to achieve his goals. One day, he comes across some people filming crime scenes as a sale for news footage as for their career, also known as 'nightcrawling'. And so, Louis Bloom involves as a curiosity into this business. As the film progresses, he gets very good and professional at the job, in fact.. he gets way too good at this job as he, himself commits crimes and acts in illegal actions. First off, Jake Gyllenhaal gives his finest role and performance throughout his career. He is absolutely courageous and self-conscious. He is fully engaged with that character, he withdraws himself and becomes fully the character Louis Bloom, which makes us the audience frightening and terrifying as we see him burst his way of performance. Also, it is so frightening how our main character Louis Bloom starts off as a protagonist, and as the film progresses, becomes an unexpected and fearful antagonist. However, so riveting and outstandingly written dialogue makes certain situations so exciting and realistic, adding unsteadiness which makes us sweat in thrills. From these amazingly written dialogues, even though Louis Bloom transforms into an antagonist, we root for him, and we want him to succeed in every possible way, after all, he has committed crimes and taken illegal actions. Additionally, the last act, the last 15 to 20 minutes are the most suspenseful and hand-gripping finales that additionally decorates this film more beautifully. The streets of L.A look immaculately beautiful and flawlessly colored, which contains solid eye candy visuals. Overall, this film depicts the realism of the society as well as illustrating the character, Louis Bloom perfectly flawless. It is most certainly one of the best films of 2014 as well as the best- written script forms of this decade. For writer Dan Gilroy's first directorial debut, it is very impressive and unbelievable of what he accomplished."
" ""Nightcrawler"" excellent, but a few ethical issues linger
",0.7783,-0.8131,2017-04-11 00:00:00,10,"Local news stations live and die by the ratings. Whether it's the royal wedding or a high-speed chase, reporters toil around the clock for the next big story that will increase the viewership and advertising revenue of their stations. When however, does the next big story cease to be news? ""Nightcrawler"" highlights the broad line between good journalism and morbid entertainment, and what can happen when that line is crossed. Despite being credited as the film's lead, there is no trace of Jake Gyllenhaal in ""Nightcrawler."" Losing 30 pounds to play the part, Gyllenhaal immerses himself into the role of petty thief Lou Bloom both physically and psychologically. From the opening shots of the film, you can tell that something is off about Bloom. After stealing chain links from a fence on private property, he assaults a security guard, delivers the stolen materials to a Los Angeles construction site and tries to sell himself as a potential employee to the site manager. Noticing a car crash on his drive home, Bloom pulls over to investigate. Two freelance videographers arrive at the scene shortly after and film police officers pulling the driver from the burning wreckage. When asked by Bloom, one of the cameramen reveals that he and his partner drive around LA, filming anything and everything to sell to the news station that will pay the most. ""If it bleeds it leads,"" the cameraman tells him. Inspired by the encounter, Bloom pawns a stolen bicycle, purchases a camcorder and a police scanner and begins working as a stinger. Bloom presents his first clip of footage to local TV news station director Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who describes her station's newscast as, ""a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut."" Bloom adheres to this ideology in his work, exposing his darker nature to the audience. Infatuated with his growing success, Bloom pushes every moral and legal boundary imaginable to get the perfect shot.Gyllenhaal's performance is enthralling. Despite the disturbing and sociopathic nature of his role, his character intrigues you. Bloom is passionate. Bloom is driven. Bloom is wickedly smart. He has an eerie charisma about him that seeps under your skin.Rene Russo is also exceptional. Unlike Bloom, Romina fully comprehends the magnitude of her choices, sacrificing her morality for television ratings. When the thrills of Bloom's nocturnal crusades are sucking you in, Kevin Rahm's character, Frank Kruse, serves as the conscience to bring you back to reality. Despite his efforts, the concerns of the honest journalist sadly get swept under the rug by the prowess of Bloom and Romina.The cinematography and editing by Robert Elswit and John Gilroy fuel the intensity of the acting. Whether Bloom is recruiting his partner Rick (Riz Ahmed) at a diner in the late afternoon or he is pursuing a high-speed car chase in the heat of the night, each scene is an exhilarating experience. The film's many shining qualities are only a testament to the thought-provoking script of Dan Gilroy. The scenes and dialogue bring to mind recent events such as the shooting of reporter Allison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward in Virginia. In the shooting's aftermath, there were news websites and stations that chose to run the footage from a video posted online by the shooter, which showed the victims being shot at close range. The ethicality of this has been questioned, as it shows little respect for the victims' families. Sadly however, footage of this magnitude engages our morbid curiosity, and Gilroy explores this truth as the basis of Bloom and Romina's actions in the film.In a 2014 interview with LA Weekly, Gyllenhaal humorously remarks, ""There is a Lou in all of us. I don't know if that disturbs you!"" While I think this is far from the case, our culture as a whole contributes considerably to the ""if it bleeds, it leads"" mentality. Next time you see a brutal or disrespectful video, don't support it. Don't promote it. We can change the rating trends. We can rise above the culture."

The message appears not to be about the evil media corrupting a man, or a man corrupting the innocent media, but perhaps the media set-up being dangerously receptive to any monstrous practitioners who might turn up.There is a great deal to appreciate here, with good work in all areas, but I have to say, I came away feeling somewhat soiled, and can't say I 'enjoyed' the film."

In the process of doing this, he happens upon a film crew covering a crime scene...and Louis has found his purpose. He soon gets himself a cheap camcorder and police scanner and soon begins spending his evenings driving about LA--looking for mayhem in order to make a buck off it. As the film progresses, Louis' complete lack of ethics and conscience is shocking...especially when he begins manipulating things to make news stories and withholding police evidence in order to get the BIG story!This film is incredibly cynical in the way it shows the news. It shows the newsfolk as mostly a lot of soulless bottom-feeders--and Louis is the king of them all. And, as his videos become more and more horrific, Louis seems to be enjoying it with an almost orgiastic pleasure. I really appreciated in the film is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. His wide-eyed almost insane look really helped his character...as did his weird, gaunt look. And, it helped that the more awful the things were that he was covering, the happier he appeared. Some excellent acting by him. Overall, a cynical, intense and difficult film that is not for everyone...and it's a logical 21st century extension of the sort of exploitative news that thrilled audiences with ""Network""."

Neither one of them liked it, they said it just went on and on about how nuclear weapons are bad without adding anything else meaningful or insightful. That's the problem with this movie. Of course people have a fascination with violence. Whether it's the Romans watching the gladiators killing each other in the Colosseum back in the day or the thousand or so TV shows there are about Nazi's. We all know it, we see it on the news every night. This movie wants to point that out. And.that's it. People like violence in the news and that's bad. Oh and Jake tries to do a Hannibal Lector impression. A very bad one. His idea of a being a psycho is just to stare at things with big eyes and to enunciate every word to death. His performance is terrible. Just terrible. His character is not interesting, nor engaging. He is not even fun to hate. He is just kind of weird. Not much else. He screws around LA.

The film is also very similar to Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and David Fincher's 'Seven' as the cinematography is very bleak and dark.The story is disturbingly gripping as the audience view Lou Bloom's rise as an amateur journalist who seems to do anything to get the best footage of horrific crime scenes.

Later he sees the footage on TV, realizing he may be able to do this too. Thus begins Bloom's adventure in building a ""succesful TV news business."" Why does this movie slay? Because every line bites with irony and wit. It blends genres and themes. It asks questions and prods the viewer to look inward and reflect as producers and consumers. To what extent, if any, is the audience responsible for actors like Bloom working in a capitalist economy. What accountability can be placed on the viewer who demands, values, and consumes the product Bloom delivers? Does the viewer have any interest in curbing that demand or consumption? Should Bloom's actions be regulated, restricted, or shamed? Maybe they should be praised and celebrated?Answers to these questions fall in a gray area. And the movie does well to stimulate introspection and discussion by focusing on difficult questions instead of leading the viewer to form knee-jerk judgments and conclusions. Although the story brings out Bloom's sociopathic qualities, where the storytellers stand on preventing people like Bloom from thriving is not clear. Maybe a solution would include more protections, regulations, emphasis on family values, better law enforcement, consumer restrictions, censoring or limiting the media. Maybe Bloom is just a necessary evil that we should accept, a byproduct of the human condition, industry, and capitalism. Who knows..."

This motion picture directly and cruelly revealed evil side of human nature which depicting the process of depraving caused by desire.

" Doesn't Pause Enough To Examine The Really Great Material
",0.659,0.9944,2017-02-27 00:00:00,5,"On the surface, ""Nightcrawler"" is a very well-made film. The production value is high, the visuals are great, acting is solid, and it delves into a number of very relevant themes regarding journalism and TV news. The problem, however, is that director Dan Gilroy doesn't pause nearly enough to examine the really interesting parts of the film. Instead, everything in the movie is kind of viewed in the abstract...with very little (and thus I would argue not nearly enough) context given in order to make it a truly great piece of film-making.For a basic plot summary, ""Nightcrawler"" sees Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying desperately to find a job in a rough economy. One night, he stumbles upon a crime scene and meets Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), an independent TV news cameraman who impresses Louis with his ability to ""do the dirty work"" and get paid handsomely for it. So, Louis decides to get into the TV journalism business himself, even doing well enough to hire a partner in Rick (Riz Ahmed). Along the way, Louis also develops a relationship (that some might consider inappropriate) with head news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo). Things seem to be going great for Louis and his thriving business...until the night he arrives at a burglary scene before the police, making a number of choices leading him down a shady ethical path that he may or may not recover from.Easily the two most interesting parts of this film are Gyllenhaal's Louis and the movie's examination of the TV news business. Both of those subjects carry very weighty, relevant themes in today's society and are worthy of examination. Unfortunately, both are also just kind of glossed over in favor of ""the spectacle"" in this case.Louis is one of the strangest characters I've ever seen on the big screen (done to perfection, as usual, by the underrated Gyllenhaal). On one hand, you can kind of feel sorry for him, as he never seems to catch a break early on. On the other hand, he is such a smarmy individual that he is far from like-able. Usually I like this kind of ambiguity in my film characters, but in this case it comes off more as confusing than interesting. At the end of flick, I didn't feel like I cared any more about Louis than I did, oh, 20 or so minutes in.As for the many themes regarding televised news, I really wish the pace of the film would have allowed even more examination of them. There is a character in the newsroom (played by Kevin Rahm) who always bring up the ethical issues of what is transpiring, but he is quickly pushed aside each and every time. Perhaps that is a statement being made in and of itself, but I still feel like the movie wanted us (as viewers) to take a few too many things at face value. I wanted to see the principals struggle a bit regarding their decisions. There just didn't seem to be any conflict in what was happening.Overall, though, ""Nightcrawler"" isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. In my mind, it is the complete and utter personification of a ""three star effort"", as it easily did enough to hold my interest, yet didn't do anything more to really make me care in the end. To me, this was very much a ""take it or leave it"" experience. Had some closer examination of themes/characters taken place, I think it could have been much, much more interesting."

Jake Gyllenhaal portrayed a perfect mixture of Javier Bardem (the bad guy in 'no country for old men' and 'Skyfall') and Toby Macguire (Spiderman 3, the scene where he is venom with the emo haircut). With the cinematic shots reminiscent of Rockstars seminal masterpiece GTA V, albeit to a mistuned station. I found myself drawn to Gyllenhaal's character as he achieved his goals, following a classic rags to riches story of a budding reporter trying to make a buck (we can all relate)."
" Well crafted look at a sociopath
",0.2732,0.9744,2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"There have been many movies that critique capitalism, the American dream, and the increasing voyeurism in American culture. Nightcrawer ranks among the best of them. Dan Gilroy's work is so stunningly crafted that it's hard to believe this his debut. The film follows the rise of Louis Bloom (a truly transformed Jake Gyllenhaal). When we meet Bloom he is working as a petty thief, struggling to find a profession in the midst of a recession and unable to find work. He takes his setbacks in stride, constantly on the lookout for opportunity and a chance to move upwards. That moment comes at the site of a car crash. Slowing down his car to watch as two police officers struggle to free a woman as her car quickly goes up in flames, Louis notices some men aggressively filming the rescue operation. After pumping one of the cameramen for information he learns that they are free lance photographers, working to find the bloodiest most gruesome footage and selling it to morning news shows who keep looking for bloodier and bloodier footage to maintain what little viewership they still have. Stealing his way into obtaining a cheap camcorder Louis sets out to get his own slice of this gruesome pie and it isn't long before he begins to climb his way up the ladder, resorting to increasingly illegal and sketchy tactics to insure that he gets the perfect shot and the highest cheques. Literally everything about this film is flawlessly made. The script is tight, the cinematography, which captures L.A. at night, is dark and beautiful. Jake Gyllenhaal is the standout. There's just something slightly off and creepy about Louis's physicality but it never descends into parody or caricature. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Rene Russo is flawless as a cut throat news producer with little ethics. Riz Ahmed is great as Rick, Louis's intern/assistant who swallows his fears about what he's doing for the promise of cash. An auspicious debut by Gilroy, I can't wait to see what he does next."
" Steady Hands
",0.0,0.9972,2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"For the past 3 years I've heard nothing but good things about Nightcrawler and heard nothing but critical acclaim for Jake Gyllenhaal performance and after seeing it I can easily say that all that praise is easily deserved, this is a film unlike any other that I've ever seen, the whole idea of people listen to police frequencies and filming crime scenes for the news is a strange plot but one that was honestly fascinating to watch, seeing the lengths that these people go to for footage made the film much more interesting to watch, it definitely felt like it was an area that had been exploited and added to the creep factor of this film. Much like the film itself the thing I loved about Jake Gyllenhaals performance was how different it was, the formal way he spoke and the repetitive techniques he uses to talk to people made his character an interesting presence. This film also did something for me that very few other films have, it didn't bother me that it had a lot of awkward interactions between characters, it added to the unhinged and strange nature of Gyllenhaals character. The main character is the thing that carries this movie and he is most definitely not this films hero, I could just as easily describe him as an antagonist because he does such horrible things in this film that make you realise that he's not the ""good guy"" but instead a pretty horrific person. This film also has a really great atmosphere to it, it made LA night life feel gritty and violent. Meg Ryan was also brilliant in this film she felt like a real professional and the perfect opposing force to Gyllenhaal, she's also a very well written character that has clear vulnerabilities that makes her better rounded as a person. I only really have on flaw with this film and it's Riz Ahmed's character, Ahmed was brilliant in this film but the character was boring, he had no presence to him, he got on my nerves a lot and the scenes between them never really grabbed me like the rest of the film did. This is a truly original and different film, Gyllenhaal gives his best performance since Zodiac, the main protagonist is interesting to watch, it's got such a real life and gritty vibe to it and it was only aspects of Ahmed's character that got to me in an overall truly fantastic film. 9.3/10: A (Phenomenal)"
" Nothing to do with X-men
",0.0,0.9895,2017-01-23 00:00:00,9,"Okay, so please don't tell me that I'm the only person who, every time he sees the word 'Nightcrawler,' thinks about the blue, vampire-like teleporter from X-men? All right, just me then. Anyway, this film – also entitled 'Nightcrawler' has absolutely nothing to do with superpowered mutants and more to do with the dark, seedy behind-the-scenes world of modern newsrooms. I do like X-men, but I like this more.Jake Gyllenhaal – once again – plays a brooding and possibly damaged character. We're never really given much backstory regarding how or why he's like he is. He just is. And he's just dark – possibly a modern day sociopath. While I was watching this film, all I could think of was 'American Psycho.' Not that Jake spends his evenings slicing up ladies of the night. He's far more subtle than that. He doesn't set out to cause misfortune, he simply realises that there's money to be made from other people's suffering and therefore decides to exploit this situation by becoming an independent cameraman on the streets of L.A.It's fair to say that this is hardly a 'noble profession' and he quickly discovers that he has to cut the metaphorical throat of anyone who stands in his way. Watch out rival cameraman played by Bill Paxton – it's not just aliens, Terminators and Predators who are out to get you! Gyllenhaal's character adapts with ease to this lifestyle, happy to step on anyone who gets in his way in pursuit of the next big scoop. In many films they say you have to 'relate' to the central character in order to enjoy the story. I doubt many of us will 'relate' to a man who is quite happy to trample anyone who gets in his way in order to further his own ambition, but then I doubt many people felt like they identified with Patrick Bateman and 'American Psycho' was a pretty big hit! If you watch 'Nightcrawler' you need to be prepared for a pretty bleak and dark insight into the way the world (or rather modern day news) works. It's hardly a 'feel-good' film and the whole show rests on Gyllenhaal's shoulders, but, as with many of his films before, he carries it all the way. It's weirdly hypnotic and you'll want to see just how far he'll go to achieve his self-serving ends.Ultimately, it's another notch on Gyllenhaal's impressive range of deeply disturbed characters. Don't expect a laugh a minute, side-splitting two hours, just get ready to descend into the underbelly of society and what it takes to get those 'exclusive' pictures on CNN or Sky News."
" One of the best
",0.6369,0.9858,2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"Nightcrawler is one of the best movies I've seen. It talks about how individuals in society could be full of greed and rapacity. Jake Gyllenhaal did such a great job as the character Lou Bloom. He was just the perfect fit for it. If I have read the script without knowing who the actors were, I'd definitely imagine Jake playing the role cause he's always playing those weird/creepy characters in his movies. It was that perfect! The movie is unique and quite unpredictable, so that's what made it so interesting. I haven't ever thought about how news are delivered only after watching this movie. The shooting techniques of Nightcrawler were incredible and pleasing. Definitely recommended, very eye-opening & insightful!"
" Art is pain! Or something like that.
",-0.2714,0.5934,2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Nightcrawler is a film about seeking for media attention gone too far. Up-to-date subject, yes. The production value is good too: the movie is very beautifully shot and what one sees on the screen, pleases one's eyes. A well-shot film it also should be, after all the movie is mostly about filming anyways...However, no matter how beautiful Nightcrawler looks, it cannot hide the fact that the story is very ugly, almost repulsive. The main character Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a sociopath for whom empathy towards human life seems to be totally beyond comprehension. He doesn't care if people lose their lives, he just wants to get them on the film. Actually he wants people to die so he could film them. The truth, however, is revealed to the viewer only gradually. Many signs fit to the diagnosis of psychopathy, though. I mean, Louis can be a very slim, clever and charming person when he wants to. He can also lie to anyone with a perfect poker face. This pretty much reminds me of another psychopath main character in film, Patrick Bateman (American Psycho).As the film progresses, the viewer sees Louis' progression from a courageous-seeming self-made-man to a psychopath with no boundaries. For me, this made the watching increasingly harder simply because I started to feel more and more scorn towards Louis. I guess that is a good sign, most likely I possess some sort of morale. This must also be the objective of the filmmakers and I must say that the film is truly impressive, it left its mark on me. I was very much sucked into the events of the film and for all the credibility and immersion I must thank the film crew. Nightcrawler is made very well and Jake Gyllenhaal delivers his role magnificently (he didn't even get an Oscar nomination?!). Also his counterpart, the main character's employee Rick (Riz Ahmed) is a big part of the film. Rick is, well, maybe a little pathetic and failed in life but he still has that morale and suspicion that the viewer wants to hear said out loud. He is the voice of reason. Too bad that his boss is too crazy to hear him. All the same, I love these two characters and how their performances complement each other. Once the viewer is done with the movie, he/she is probably quite anguished. This movie is dark and intense. At this point, some people may decide that they don't like the film because it ""didn't make them happy"" or something like that. Think again, my friend! I think a good movie makes a difference and IS provoking. Nightcrawler is a stand- out piece.9/10"
