" Not perfect but fun
",-0.6759,0.7562,2021-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Great message, good humour, fantastic animation. Definately more for adults than for kids. I actually watched this when it came out and didn't like it that much but I gave it another shot years later and did not regret it! I was not too fond of the song choices nor the amount of singing in the first half of the movie but the second half made up for it."
" Love magic
",0.6369,-0.6378,2021-03-05 00:00:00,4,"Too many songs back to back and at times can be cringey, but has some small funny scenes.The animation was decent and not hard to look at, it's bad but not God awful bad. check it out for yourself"
" A rip off of megamind, frozen and others.
",0.0,0.9931,2021-02-26 00:00:00,1,This has good concept but this is a huge miss potential the animation is ugly and it has too many songs its like there's no good plot and 80% is basically cheesy songs. Its suppose to be based off a mid summer night dream but I haven't seen anything related to that classic William Shakespeare play. Not mention it rips off movies like megamind and frozen and beauty and the beast.Why megamind is masterpiece because we got to know the characters more and plot is amazing we got villain turned good and fell in love with girl he liked.Please do yourself a favor do not watch this film go watch megamind or frozen.Nostalgia critic man your awesome even he did good when he reviewed it.
" Strangely bad, Magically terrible
",-0.8316,-0.6908,2021-02-25 00:00:00,1,A terrible juke box musical that promotes the use of roofys. The plots confusing and all the characters are terrible. Deleted this from the computer immediately after viewing.
" Why is anyone giving this a rating of over 3?
",0.34,0.9719,2021-02-13 00:00:00,3,"Where are all these 10/10 ratings coming from? Did I watch the same movie as everyone else? I'll take inspiration from Amber Heard's deranged mind and come to the conclusion that you're all just being paid for these outlandish reviews.
I have watched EraserHead, I have watched all of the Human Centipede movies, The Room, Tall Girl, etc. But this? I would never want to watch again.
The only reason I'm giving a 3 is because the animation is quite good, and the imp possum thing is cute.The story is something a child would come up with in creative writing class, and oh my god the songs; every 2 minutes you get some ridiculous out of place pop song that are made worse by the actual singing of the voice actors themselves. There's more singing than actual talking.
None of the characters are likeable, especially our lead protagonist who becomes all edgy after getting her heart broken in the first like 3 minutes of the movie; her entire personality shifted.Just because this is primarily targeted at children, it doesn't mean that they deserve this drivel. There are plenty of child targeted movies that are far better than this.
So, your child might like it, but for the love of god do not allow them to have it on repeat - You will go insane."
" Very high quality !
",0.0,0.9782,2021-02-12 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie, so did my girls, I thought It was very powerful and rich animation, interesting and fun sound tracks and cool characters, overall it was attractive from beginning to the very end, though it was a simple and cliche love story."
" Really bad
",-0.5849,-0.3447,2021-02-08 00:00:00,2,"Just when you may think the film is over, it keeps dragging on and on and on.We're expected to believe that at the beginning of the film, the main character has experienced heartbreak and has become hard/tough. This is really bad writing, because moving on is actually very difficult and the way they portrayed it in less than a minute is very inaccurate. There honestly needs to be better character building. A lot of events happen in this movie and they don't really make sense, and are extremely cheesy or over-the-top, instead of sincere."
" Dont understand the low rating
",0.2057,0.9394,2020-12-30 00:00:00,10,"Given a 10 because 5.8 doesn't give it justice. Funny, feel good film. Great songs throughout and strong characters. Really well animated too. A nice family film."
" Adorable
",0.4939,0.9779,2020-10-11 00:00:00,10,At first I wasnt sure about this movie but once I watched half I fell in love!! Sends a strong message that it doesn't matter who you fall in love with as long as they love you the same!
" Hard Pass
",-0.1027,0.5271,2020-09-07 00:00:00,2,"I tried coming in with an open mind and I just can't. My daughter loves it, she's 14 and thinks it's cheesy and hilarious and perfect so there's that."
" The Music Got Me
",0.0,0.9935,2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,I really wasn't sure but the music got me interested. I watched this and was surprised by how much I liked it. It was fun and the premise that everyone deserves to be loved played out with a healthy dose of humor to keep it from being too sweet. The characters were all engaging. My favorite was Sunny! You must watch it to appreciate it.
" Astonishingly not great
",-0.5096,0.9681,2020-09-06 00:00:00,2,"I could go into GREAT detail about why I hat this movie, but put simply, missed opportunity.
I feel like the concept of a happy go lucky woman who wears her heart on her sleeve falling for an emotionally abused man who's corrupted soul makes him reject the idea of love seems like a clever idea, if it would just reinforce that."

" Disney for grown ups
",0.0,0.602,2020-08-16 00:00:00,10,"Wonderful film.
It seems to me that the poor reviews are from those who want every film to fit in a certain category and regard animation as a media for children.Great characters,great songs what is there not to like.Thank goodness for people who are prepared to break the Disney mold."
" Great job!
",0.6588,0.7096,2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,I rented this for my daughter when she was 10. Eventually buying it after she rented it so many times. Now all my kids sing along with the movie. Its cute and funny in just the right spots.
" The second half is better than the first half.

",0.6757,0.9813,2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is really something special but I love it. The beauty and the beast story turns out very good in this funny musical. It has girlpower, old school music and ofcs romance. It's hard to put in words everything this movie is, just take my advice and watch it. Because you might find a new favourite movie!"
" truly horrendous
",-0.2263,0.0,2020-01-03 00:00:00,2,"I managed to watch only about 10 minutes of this film, with my jaw hanging the whole time wondering what on earth they were thinking."
" Great story but bad design
",-0.4939,0.2981,2019-12-29 00:00:00,7,"To be honest, the design of the characters aren't great which may be the reason why many people didn't like it but the storyline and the vibe of the musical scenes especially in the ""Strange Magic"" song and the mash-ups of some songs were totally well-made. I sure hope you'll make more movies with great storylines like this but maybe try to also think for better visuals."
" Fantastic movie, fun, light hearted, musical
",0.7845,0.9864,2019-11-02 00:00:00,10,"I don't have children and watched this one Saturday morning relaxing, made me smile from Ear to ear, great music, fab story for singletons and couples alike!! So many bits that made me laugh, great animation, delight for eyes and ears. Cheese fabulous fun!!"
" Great movie
",0.6249,-0.504,2019-09-22 00:00:00,9,"This movie is difficult to explain. When I first saw this movie, I did not think it a love movie and then when I have finished watch it I am surpired! This is one of ten good movies I have seen in this year."
" The design was STOLEN from Patrick Woodroffe.
",-0.6037,0.9584,2019-08-03 00:00:00,2,"I am sorry but perhaps it's a good movie for little childrens with a story you can write in less than 10 lines.It get an amazing looking, honestly that's very good IF the design was not STOLEN FROM Patrick Woodroffe.Backgrounds and characters are simply a robbery of his last 25 years of hard working. And Disney do not even bother.The musics are not from disney at all and are just musical recovery from 1970 - 1990. 90% of the time.And the movie is flat and linear. For me except the good looking it's one of the worst Disney i ever watch. And an insult to Mr Woodroffe.A company of this size can manage to do way way better without rip off the works of others."
" This is why I rarely listen to critics
",0.2235,0.4903,2019-07-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie is awesome, I freaking love it.
Yeah it's cliche, predictable and corny - but that's the whole idea, in fact it's so corny, so predictable and so cliche that it's awesome!
I'm not good at reviews, I never will be, but seriously all the down votes - I had to write something. This is not the best movie ever, not the greatest either, but it is awesome. Just watch it, you'll know what I mean - at least if you're in to the cult movies thing."
" F$ck me. What a work of art.
",0.0,0.9638,2019-07-14 00:00:00,9,"F$ck me. What a work of art.
Let's start with, I'm a big fan of cgi And being so I can really appreciate how much work and care was put into animating those characters. It was not some rushed job, where animators did what they could within alloted time. Having said that...
The movie is precious. I was so amazed how well the characters emote real human emotions. Although I always skip the singing parts, their voices were so on., I could not get enough of it. (from the opening song ""only fools rush in"" the way she sang... and the endings of the verses with that ...whhhe high pitch, makes you want to just hug the hell out of her.)
What I'm saying is... It maybe not as advertised as ""Frozen"", this one beats it.
Treat for your kids, and one to keep. You? You should enjoy it too. It's a feel good fairy tale. What's not to love about love right? Strong 9, as in, well beyond ""above average""."
" Why do people hate this movie?
",-0.5719,0.8871,2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"I'll tell you - it's because it relies on an intelligent storyline instead of mindless action and special effects. In other words, if you're too stupid to understand more than single syllable words you won't get this movie.Granted It starts off fairly boring, but if you keep watching things start getting good around 15 minutes in.... and from 46 minutes on you'll be laughing nearly non-stop.As an aside, it never gets old watching a ""bad guy"" - who thinks they're prepared for EVERYTHING - wind up getting taken by surprise by the ONE thing they DIDN'T expect or plan on, lol!"
" Why all the hate? Is it just because Lucas was behind it?
",-0.6199,0.9495,2019-05-14 00:00:00,8,"Very well crafted, entertaining and touching story, that subverts expectations on a much more sophisticated level than Rian Johnson's sophomoric garbage.Lucas is a creative genius and is a great storyteller but just because his material is mainly for kids, doesn't warrant complete dismissal from adult reviewers. These films require you put in your kid goggles to fully appreciate the experience the movie offers. The ending was a real tear-jerker even though it unfolded in the most unconventional way for a fairy-tale. Well worth a view if you didn't catch it at theaters."
" Love this!
",0.6696,0.9513,2019-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This is just so awesome, it's so different fun and unique! I don't like musicals but I was singing through the whole thing. I loved the storyline, the music choice, the characters, the animation style, all of it!
It's so fun!"
" Beautiful animation, great soundtracl
",0.8402,0.9773,2019-04-19 00:00:00,8,This is a fun movie! Looks fantastic and story line is great! This is a beautifully animated musical about love. Trailers are misleading to the musical take on the story. Graphics are amazing. Soundtrack is so much fun.
" FANTASTIC
",0.5574,0.788,2019-04-16 00:00:00,10,It's really a wonderful movie. Definitely under-appreciated
" How did I not know about this movie before??
",0.0,0.9991,2019-03-03 00:00:00,10,"It was 2018 when I first came across Strange Magic. I was scrolling through Google movies and I saw this and read the blurb, I added it to my list and forgot about it for a few months. One evening when I pretty much exhausted myself on rewatching my favs, I put this on and honestly did not expect to find it to be one of my new favorites. It is one of those movies you never think you are going to want to watch over and over and yet here I am rewatching for the umpteenth time and it has not gotten old to me yet. I purchased the digital copy and keep it on hand in my phone for when I need a boost, smile or a laugh. I was delighted to see that Starz has added this to it's line up and hopefully others will see this little gem.
The characters are unique and at times in the movie look real, now it doesn't have the same graphic of looking real through the whole movie, but that doesn't bother me at all.
I truly enjoyed this new spin on the age old moral of ""not judging a book by its cover"". IMHO, the Bog King is my favorite character and how he is portrayed through the movie is done by Allan Cummings, I believe, excellent voice work and awesome singing. I love how he is so grotesque to look at in the beginning, then when he and Princess Maryanne are flying through the Dark Forrest, you are actually feeling as she is beginning to think and feel about him. Those scenes alone are beautiful to watch, he gives and entirely different perspective on the gross and creepy crawling bugs and goblins. The same can be said for Roland, he is ""so good looking"" that even her own father, the King, would have her overlook his cheating ways because he looks like the ideal husband for her. I liked the way the relationship is between the two sisters, and you genuinely care about them and what happens to them. The only thing I found predictable about this was the story line between the younger Princess and Sunny. Sunny was definitely a great character!! I loved Sunny and the Imp!!! I also loved BK's somewhat over the top mother, but just as with all mother's, she only wants happiness for her son. I rated this a 10, not because it is the best or Oscar worthy, I gave it a 10 because it kept me entertained from start to end, was fresh and fun to watch!"
" Lucas Should Stick To Sci-fi
",0.0,0.9952,2019-02-17 00:00:00,7,"*Edited for spellingI only briefly remember seeing ads for this movie and totally forgot about it, but it had crossed my path and I decided to check it out just recently. It's not a terrible movie, it has some humorous moments, but it's easy to see why this one failed to go anywhere. The first and foremost thing you will notice is the music (no, literally, that's the first thing you get just after the short narration at the beginning). There is a LOT of music. Seriously, even Disney doesn't put this much music into their movies, there's literally a song every five minutes. The strange thing is that the movie is acutely aware of this as multiple times characters will make reference to the singing (or rather hating the singing). This seems odd because everyone just randomly breaks out into a song and dance number for no apparent reason. Unsure of why this is odd? Imagine if you're walking down the street and someone starts singing and dancing in front of you, a song ABOUT you and then just carries on as if nothing happened. At least in most Disney movies, the songs are used to convey a feeling or it can be a way to tell a part of the story, the singing and dancing isn't really ""happening"", it's just a way the story is told for the audience. Think of Anna on the mountain singing ""Let It Go"" and replace it with just simple dialog as she makes up her mind then and there that she will do what she wants with no one to tell her otherwise, doesn't sound as epic as the song makes it sound, does it?Then there's the actual choice of music. I fondly remember ""A Knight's Tale"". Very decent movie with a good story and wonderful acting, but it was marred by the overuse of modern music and it really takes away from the immersion of it being a medieval story about knights and jousting. You get caught up in ""how did they know this music?"" and it really takes your mind out of the moment, that's not a good thing when you want to keep your audience focused on the story. I found the same thing happening with this movie, the collection of music (while thoroughly enjoying it in my own playlists) is just wrong for this type of movie. It isn't bad music and it's the characters that are singing it AND the songs fit the moment they are in, but it just makes you take a step back and say ""how do they even know this music exists?"". This is supposed to be a FANTASY movie, the music breaks this concept. It's as if the writers just couldn't help but have something modern in a full on fantasy movie. Had there been humans (say, like ""Epic"" of ""Ferngully""), then you have a reason to introduce at least SOME modern music if the situation calls for it. Most of the music just felt forced and unneeded to tell the story.The CG was actually pretty well done. Everything was crisp and vibrant, skin tones looked like skin instead of plastic, overall it was very pleasing to look at. The design of the characters themselves, on the other hand, left much to be desired. A lot of the faces were really pushing the uncanny valley with the extremely big eyes, small mouths, extreme facial expressions and the fact that nearly every character had to mug the camera and get right in your face did not help. I'm suspecting this might have been for a 3D effect, but it just comes off as really weird looking as the characters rush toward the camera. Faces included. Most of the creatures were decent enough as you sort of expect ""ugly"" to be what you see when you think of trolls or goblins or any manner of strange thing that isn't human.The story itself was good, but it did seem to drag on a bit, there are points where you will be thinking ""oh, they're gonna wrap this up pretty quick"" and then find out that you're only half way through the movie. Something about the way the plot played out made me think this multiple times. I'm not quite sure where I would cut things out to make it shorter, but it does seem like they could have easily shaved off a half hour somewhere. Overall, it's just a basic love story, nothing really new or exciting except it's fairies and creatures.Not a terrible movie, not the best either, it does fall somewhere in between. You probably won't make a conscience decision to go out and grab it, but it is at least worth a watch if you want to waste a couple of hours. It's still very, very strange to see the Lucasfim logo tacked on the beginning without a text crawl following."

It's poorly written, ugly, stupid, and nonsensical.Okay, there is one thing that I liked. The movie takes an interesting turn towards the end. I liked what they did with two of the characters. Unfortunately, it's too little too late. In order to save this monstrosity of a motion picture, it needs to be completely rewritten.I also detest the fact that they had the audacity to make this a musical, using only top 40 songs about love. It's as if this movie was tailor-made to annoy me.If you like character inconsistencies, plot holes, unfunny jokes, and uncanny valley faces, then this movie is for you.Sorry George, but your animated musical stinks."

" Winning Formula... lousy execution
",-0.0258,0.992,2018-06-27 00:00:00,3,"Gets three stars more on the attempt. On the paper, it sounds like a hit: Midsummer Night's Dream where people fall in love with the wrong person (""wrong"" for a reason or another where there isn't necessarily magic involved) plus Beauty and the Beast (with the twist, ""Where the Beast doesn't change"".) with one message, ""Everybody deserves love""... sounds awesome, am I right?Yeah...Disregarding Lucas' interview where he states that 'Star Wars is for 12 year old boys... this is for 12 year old girs' because I really hope that what I understood wasn't what he meant, ""Strange Magic"" as many have commented it... is just strange and not so magic.The beginning was 'ok'...The development of the girly and literal Princess of the Fairies into this strong and skilled warrior was because her very handsome suitor cheated on her, and we have that via a musical and a ""dramatic makeover"", the whole thing was superficial and the opposite of what I think the movie was aiming for, ""I will no longer be this girl whose whole world revolves around the perfect man... so I will change everything, my looks, my personality, my interests... because of a man."" I would have a lot more respect (for the concept) if she just refused to marry the guy (as she did... with another song, mind you) and the change was gradual, bit by bit through the movie. A single scene (read: song) with the personality change just screams teen angst (""a phase"").Then we are introduced to the king of Goblins... who, by the way, doesn't look like the other Goblins, who are mostly fast, too big or too small and with no human features on sight (horns, fins, so on), instead, he is tall, with lean muscles, with a very much human face... and with wings, but they look more like an insect's than a butterfly's like the Princess' people so that counts as an ""ugly"" feature, I guess?From the very same second he is introduced, we can already predict where the movie is going: the scorned, heartbroken princess will fall in love ""despite the ugly exterior"" of the king and the rude and cruel king will fall in love with her and become gentle and kind.Predictable to the extreme.Another kick: when they meet, the princess insults the guy's looks, asking how can her sister (at the time under the effects of a love potion) fall in love with someone so ugly... not cruel nor arrogant nor rude... someone so UGLY... so much for the determination of not letting looks dicate her feelings anymore.The king's reason to be the way he is? You guess it... heartbreak.And after the climax (a fight between the king and her cheater suitor... of course), everybody lives happily ever after.If anything, it was the sidekicks (the sister and her very short and not very attractive admirer) that should get the praise for ""Everybody deserves love"" and etc, if that because the elf is sweet and loyal, if easy to manipulate);"
" Loved it!!

" Full of old stereotypes - dreadful story
",-0.4404,0.6556,2018-03-31 00:00:00,2,"For a modern film, this is full of out of date stereotypes. Why is it perfectly acceptable for a beautiful princess to fall in love with a hideous man, yet there are no stories of handsome men falling for hideous women? All this feeds the stereotypes that females should be pretty, but men can be whatever they want. The only time this is reversed in the film it is used for comedy.If you don't wish for your children to be tainted by this I would avoid."
" A very annoying nail in the coffin of George Lucas' film career.
",-0.4576,0.7257,2018-02-06 00:00:00,3,"I was nine when I first George Lucas' magnum opus ""Star Wars"". It not only opened my eyes to exciting and fun characters as well as a very imaginative creative world, it essentially sparked my interest in film, and made me appreciate story and characters more and more. It became one of my favorite movies of all time which is just sad considering he went from making that film to the annoying thing that is known as ""Strange Magic"". And when I say annoying, I really do mean annoying. It's unbelievable how much this film shocked me. How did the man that make ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" give us this? No, wait. I take that back. This is from the man that also made ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Howard the Duck"". Why am I not surprised? Oh, just wait till I give you my full thoughts on this garbage. It's going to be really fun.In a world of magic and fantasy exist two kingdoms split between lightness and darkness. The darker kingdom has been hunting down primrose flowers down mainly because it is known for creating a love potion which the evil Bog King (Alan Cumming) hates. Meanwhile in the lighter kingdom, a fairy princess named Marianne (Evan Rachel Wood) has had her heart broken by the handsome warrior Roland (Sam Palladio) and through very rushed character development has promised never to love again. Wanting to win her heart back, Roland asks an elf named Sunny (Elijah Kelley) to find the captured Sugar Plum Fairy (Kristin Chenoweth) to make a love potion hoping it could win over Marianne's heart back. After retrieving the potion, things don't go according to plan when the potion accidentally gets sprinkled on Marianne's sister Dawn (Meredith Anne Bull) who is even captured by the Bog King who orders the kingdom to get the potion back before moon down. So, what happens after this? You can look up a plot synopsis on the internet to figure out the rest your self because I just want to rip into this disaster.At first, I will admit I did get slightly into the story at first due to it's interesting ideas and my love for fantasy. However, the film completely looses all hope of survival after we hear Marianne sing ""I Can't Help Falling In Love With You"". In fact, I forgot to mention that this film was a jukebox musical that has a lot of songs. And I really mean, a lot. By the time we got to third song, we weren't even fifteen minutes into the film. In fact, want to know how many songs there are in the movie? Thirteen. Yeah, you read that right. Thirteen! An average Disney movie has about six or seven. Speaking of Disney who now owns Lucasfilm, you could really tell that they did not want to have anything to do with the movie, and it obviously shows. They released this film under their Touchstone banner, did little promotion of it, and only released a trailer about two months before the film was released. Isn't that ridiculous? I honestly don't blame them for wanting to get away from an annoying story and annoying characters. Yeah, let's go over the story as well. It's easily the worse thing in the entire movie. The film's theme of love was so obnoxious and all over the film that it drove me crazy. I also hated the rushed character development the film had with it's characters, particularly Marianne. She initially starts off as a cute princess in the beginning of the film and is shown to be unable to use a sword then after her heart is broken, she sings this stupid musical number, changes her clothes, and is instantly a rebellious fairy. No training is shown whatsoever and we don't even know how she even got good at it because the film didn't take the time to explain. The Bog King was also terrible considering that he actually sang that he was evil. I put my hands on my face as soon as I heard that. I mean, this is terrible writing! No villain just goes out there and says he's evil. He does what he does because he believes it the right thing to do, when it's really not. The only praise worthy elements I can give to this film is the animation. It looked so stunning and beautiful that I was even angered even more that it was put in a film like this.""Strange Magic"" is just an annoying picture. The story, characters, songs, everything about this film annoyed me. It's such a shame that George Lucas went from being one of the most influential directors of all time to a total joke. If there's anything that this film will be remembered for, its as the nail that sealed the coffin of George Lucas' film career shut."
" Visuals were nice, but that's about it.
",0.2263,-0.8621,2017-11-30 00:00:00,3,"It wasn't a completely terrible movie, however, the story line was boring and left a lot to be desired. The visuals, however, were great and probably the only redeeming quality of the movie. The choice of songs included in the sound track were decent, but I think Trolls did a far better job of being ""self-aware"" of its own singing clichés.The Bog King wasn't a likable character, despite the writers trying so hard to shoehorn in sympathy for him. Marianne had good potential, but in the end she pretty much reverted back to what she was in the beginning, thus trashing all her of character development. And Dawn... Dawn was a very sad stereotype. The Fairy King, I think, was my least favorite character just because of what a horrible father he was. If anything, he was even dumber than Dawn.Overall, the plot was very predictable and tried far too hard to incorporate the ""don't judge a book by its cover"" theme. It tried to make an unconventional love story where the attractive guy is evil and the unattractive guy gets the girl, but it tried too hard and in the end we ended up with one dimensional and unlikable characters.That being said, if you need to distract your kids for an hour or two then go ahead and plop them down in front of the screen. It'll keep them busy for awhile."
" If you don't want a book judged by its cover, don't wrap it with a ugly on.
",-0.5457,0.8393,2017-11-26 00:00:00,5,"This movie left a nut tied in my stomach as I watched the unrealistic and unexpected romance evolve between Bob king and Marianne. I must say ""I didn't see that coming"". AlThough Strange Magic has those music going but it didn't sit well for a children fairy tale. It was supposed to be a happy ending but for many like me, it was unexpected."
" Great family movie that will keep adults entertained
",0.7783,0.9888,2017-10-21 00:00:00,10,"My wife and I watched this movie with our 3.5 year old and we all really enjoyed it. I enjoyed all of the music and the story and my son enjoyed the small character pool and the action. He may not have fully understood the story but he sat through the whole movie (which for him rarely ever happens). I feel like it was the perfect mix of great for the kids as well as the parents type of movie. It probably all really depends on the age, but for my family this movie was excellent and I wish there were more movies like it!"
" Poor Lucas
",-0.4767,-0.7677,2017-08-30 00:00:00,4,"This is the first movie that George Lucas personally worked on after he officially quit ""Star Wars"". It turns out this is why he's considered to be a fallen creator. Next to ""Howard The Duck"" and ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" this is the worst film he's ever worked on. It's so disappointing how utterly cliché this movie is. It's based on ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" which is admittedly not one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. The animation can be good at times, but a lot of the time it's hard to stomach. The characters look so ugly.I was expecting at least some epic fights in the movie but the fighting was slow and poorly paced. These characters are so annoying. It's dumb that we hear all these modern songs being sung by fairies. It's basically if ""Moulin Rouge"" was bad. Well, as Doug Walker would say, if ""Moulin Rouge"" was, well, ""Moulin Rouge"". I don't believe any of the love stories featured in this at all and I think it would have worked much better as a straight up action cartoon. The characters are too shallow to enjoy. *1/2"

" Quirky & fun, but not for children
",0.2846,0.9902,2017-05-06 00:00:00,7,"Strange Magic is a not an animated film for kids, more directed to teens and adults. This is an odd film, a mix of The Princes Bride meets Tim Burton's world and they sing Moulin Rouge style.The main virtues of the film are, beyond the beautiful animation and character design, the quirkiness of it. To me, the most important thing in movies that are derivative an predictable like this one is the sense of humour and the message conveyed. Strange Magic was funny to me, and found myself laughing more than once. The message if is not new, but important to recall it, there is a lid for every pot, love comes in all colors and shapes, and love happens between people who are, a priori, very different and even opposite. The film is unpretentious, and the familiar soundtrack will keep you (or at least me) singing along.The cast does a good job at providing the characters with their voice and songs. I especially liked Allan Cumming as Bog King and Elijah Kelly as Sunny.There is strange magic in this film, because from the known and predictable we get something magic, perhaps just hocus-pocus, and a freaky love story. I think this is one of those movies you really like or dislike, nothing in between. I did find it very enjoyable, but I had no expectations about it, so that always helps."
" Impressively Mature, Yet still somehow innocent
",0.802,0.994,2017-05-05 00:00:00,10,"I have seen quite a lot of hate towards this movie, but I can't quite see where it comes from. It seems to be a either you hate it or love it movie. The animation was dark yet beautiful. The music was well timed and perfect for where it was placed in the story. I particularly liked how it truly stuck to the theme of looking past looks and not judging a book by it's cover, unlike a certain Disney movie with the same premise. Bog isn't cruel because of his looks in the beginning, he is cruel due to the pain he feels, which is a realistic way to depict it. He doesn't magically become handsome when Marriane falls for him, but stays the way he is and they fall in love due to similar personality traits and experiences rather than because of either of their looks. It also show that beauty is in the eye of the beholder from both standpoints. We as the audience might find Marriane to be the attractive one due to her being conventionally attractive, but the movie makes it clear that she doesn't fit what Bog finds to be physically attractive initially. Sometimes who we perceive to be unattractive can become attractive if you get to know them. I think that this movie portrays that very well."
" Not what I expected, both annoying and makes you smile
",-0.0516,0.9802,2017-04-28 00:00:00,6,"Warning first: This is more of a songspiel/operette. It is more than 50% music numbers, think musical with 2 or 3 times more music than normal. This drove me nuts to begin with, because I wasn't expecting it, and was waiting for it to settle down and breathe, and all the songs made it hard for the movie to establish more than a few things at a time, but once the plot and characters were established, it much more forgivable.The story is not terribly deep, silly romance, butterfly fairies, dark fairy/bugs and some adventure and comedy, all following standard clichés. Not bad, but nothing interesting either.In the end the music did put a smile on my face, while the plot made me cringe. Not the worst, and might be more enjoyable if that is your thing and you know that is what you are in for before you start."
" Beautiful
",0.5994,0.9743,2017-04-07 00:00:00,9,"I thought this movie was absolutely beautiful. Everything from the world they created, to the the emotional developments of the characters. My wife and I kept trying to predict what tropes they might use to convey the story, and to our surprise this movie was creative enough to break the mold on a more traditional story. I had a smile just pasted onto my face for most of the movie (in particular the second half of the movie). The character growth feels genuine, and the characters aren't stereotypical. It's a very heartwarming fantasy that leaves you with some of the feelings you'd have from watching ""Megamind"", ""Willow"", and ""Frozen"" and mashed them up together. There were some visual styles that I typically don't enjoy, but they somehow made them work in the most beautiful way. Ultimately, this movie felt like food for my soul. I strongly recommend it."
" Entertaining and funny no matter how old you are.
",0.5719,0.7048,2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"In this era of weak plots, overboard effects, and pathetic attempts at humor, Lucas manages to deliver a film combining music drama comedy and more in an intelligent format suitable for the whole family! In particular, the prisoner scene in the dark forest was a hilariously nice touch - I rewound the scene at least a dozen times, and laughed even harder with each viewing. You should definitely give this film a shot!"
