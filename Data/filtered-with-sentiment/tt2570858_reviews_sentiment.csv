" Ugh
",-0.4215,0.2957,2021-02-20 00:00:00,5,"All due respect to Knudsen, she almost saved the movie and it was only worth watching for her. However movie as a movie... Waste of time! Complete waste of time."
" Feverish
",0.0,0.923,2020-11-18 00:00:00,8,"The Duke of Burgundy feels like a fever dream more than anything. Its cinematography is absolutely amazing, and the plot feels jumpy and dreamy. There are some elements of the movie that leads us to believe that perhaps not everything that is shown is true. Somewhat like the king of comedy, where perhaps some scenes are merely delusions or more fittingly, dreams.The acting in the movie is stupidly good. The characters don't feel inhuman or abnormal, as how movies that try to touch on sexual deviants tend to frame their characters, whether intentional or not. The characters are relatable and humane."
" Total rubbish
",0.0,-0.1451,2020-09-24 00:00:00,1,"I've give this piece of nonsense zero stars if I could. The director has made a complete pig's breakfast out of this and after 20 minutes of it I'd had enough, and deleted it.Don't waste your time on this garbage, it's an insult to your intelligence."
" Seductive and funny
",0.4404,0.9712,2020-07-11 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my all-time favourite films. I still come back to it on DVD now. It's stylishly seductive and very funny if you get the joke - the Carpenter's arrival and the scene in which she is measuring Evelyn for the bed is an example. Set in a fantasy country (it was filmed in unspoilt Hungary) with a 1970s feel (think Delphine Seyrig), this film is its own world with its own rules, playing out in the relationship between the women with genuine emotion. The tone and costumes recall the intellectually sexy fashion of Nova magazine to my mind, the groundbreaking women's magazine produced in the UK in the sixties which sadly folded in 1975. Peter Strickland is an outstanding talent and it is so good to see Sidse Babett Knudsen in this. The story will most likely not be what you expect but develops in surprising ways in this romance. The only critic to really get this film was Peter Bradshaw in The Telegraph UK. Duke of Burgundy is a wonderful film, unlike any other."
" Don't waste your time!!
",0.4434,0.6331,2020-04-19 00:00:00,1,Taped this from Film4 here in the UK. Watched the first 20 mins and what a load of arty farty nonsense! It amazes me how some fils like this actually get made!!! void lilke the proverbial plague.
" Stayed until the end....
",0.0,0.5499,2020-04-03 00:00:00,2,"I wanted to cry too.Beautifully shot, immaculate production, sound and music. But a 2nd year film student idea, a lot of misplace bravado, and theory in place of inspiration."
" Pretty sexy stuff
",0.765,0.9638,2020-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Even I, in my 63 year-old female dotage, got the bug. What a great pair. Both the characters and the actors. The story was tight; every moment was important; and there were a lot of silent moments. A couple of lesbians, one rich and older/one cute and younger, live together, love together, and sex up a storm. For the younger one, sex is every waking moment. Even moments with no physical contact. For her the act of being a sex slave makes her deliriously happy and sexy. She always has orders for her dominant queen. She dresses her, tells her how to sit, and how long. The dom is getting a little tired of the whole deal, or is she?"
" Sumptuous Elegant Boredom!
",0.2714,0.9513,2019-12-07 00:00:00,3,"Beautifully shot. Both women are gorgeous however there is not much progression in their relationship or story. Cynthia really is a bit useless as a Dom and her Sub Slave Evelyn ends up bossing her around a bit. It's quite pathetic really but for the beauty of their bodies, their demeanour and the sets and costumes which are just incredibly elegant and stylish. A bit of progression into becoming Switches (ie Cythia becomes the Sub and Evelyn becomes the Dom for a bit) might have been more believable as well as interesting? Evelyn clearly likes to boss her boss around but suppresses her true desires. They should all have just gone for it and explored some boundaries instead of plateauing and boring us to death! In the end but for the photography, settings and lighting this movie is a complete waste of time..."
" could of been better.
",0.4404,0.6357,2019-09-22 00:00:00,4,"I was in the S&M scene in Europe for e few years. I found this film to be a big disappointment, more based on the dynamics of a lesbian relationship going wrong as opposed to two adults enjoying a healthy BDSM relationship. the film could of showed a little bit more of the toilet scene using a few mirrors and a slightly opened door. it is correct in the idea that the submissive has a lot more control in the relationship than people on the outside would be aware of. the setting was great. the background scenery very tasteful and classy but the writing and plot just sucked. there was whole areas that just didn't make any sense. what was the purpose of the blonde lady? who was she? Was she also a dom? this movie could of been so much better."
" It stuck with me.
",-0.25,0.6588,2019-07-20 00:00:00,9,"This film stayed with me for ages after watching it, probably due to the great soundtrack!"
" Be nasty!
",-0.5983,0.9401,2019-06-21 00:00:00,8,"I was initially drawn to this production due to the involvement of the mighty Monica Swinn, who had made many sexploitation and horror pictures throughout the 1970s and 1980s; this is her first main feature film since 'Les petites sauvages' (1982). That Swinn only features briefly and without dialogue is the only disappointment I have with 'The Duke of Burgundy'.Named after the (Hamearis lucina) butterfly, this story features Cynthia (Sidse Babett Knudsen), who lectures on lepidopterology, and Evelyn (Chiara D'Anna), who appears to be not only one of her students, but her maidservant as well. Cynthia's strictness with Evelyn's hygiene and accuracy initially appears cruel and bullying, but as the standards become more outlandish, it is clear there is something else going on here. They are lovers, whilst Cynthia appears to be the dominating personality, it slowly become apparent it is Evelyn who is making the demands, and they soon become unrelenting. Uninterestingly, I mistook Evelyn's safe word 'pinastri' for a plea to 'be nasty.' Well, you never know.Whilst you could dismiss this as two eccentric ladies squabbling amid truly breath-taking surroundings, the 104 minute run-time is filled with more interest than that. Events are by turn funny, mesmerising and ultimately strangely saddening, as the need to keep up the charade, as well as the possibility of encroaching age, becomes wearing and upsetting.A study of love, and what people will do to preserve it, played for the main part as a two-hander between these extraordinary actors, is never overtly erotic: there is no nudity, for example. And yet there is a 'romantic' level of perversion on display, a strained relationship based on perceptions and sexual needs; and through it all, grumpy Lorna (Monica Swinn) is outside sweeping away the leaves and bad memories. You get the feeling she's seen and heard it all before: perfect casting! A fascinating piece. My score is 8 out of 10."
" If you love the art of cinema, you'll love 'The Duke of Burgundy'
",0.8555,0.9726,2018-10-14 00:00:00,10,"One of my favorite and most memorable films. I highly recommend this film and director to those who truly appreciate the art of cinema. I compare the director, Peter Strickland to the likes of David Lynch, Ken Russell and Luis Bu√±uel; daring, provocative and humorous. A tapestry of beautiful and seductive imagery, intense and emotive soundtrack, and absurdly twisted subject matter. WARNING: this film is definitely not recommended for immature, prudish or snobbish moviegoers -- MATURE ADULTS ONLY."
" Butterflies, Bicycles And BDSM -Oh My!
",0.0,0.9957,2018-07-15 00:00:00,7,"Up front: I would be lying outright if I claimed to understand this movie entirely. Outwardly, it is an adroit (if somewhat clinical) dissection of the quirky relationship between a lepidopterist and her apparently submissive lover. However there are, I am quite sure, many nuances and sub-references that managed to elude me. If the aim of the director was to pin the affair onto a sort of mounting board for examination without killing it stone dead in the process, it was at least partially successful. The narrative neatly begs the question: who is actually the Dominant party in a Dominance/Submission context? The inevitable ritualisation of such a partnership comes under efficient scrutiny, as do the erotic mechanics -but thankfully, those seeking abundant titillation (or, indeed, much of a story) would do well to look elsewhere.
Everything plays out over a season in a rather eccentric all-female community of bicycling scholars of butterfly, moth and insect matters. Somehow, this seems perfectly reasonable and not remotely surreal within the ambit of the movie.
I believe this to be a work of great brilliance, if devoid of much human warmth. It is a tribute to the direction that I didn't miss that warmth, and the whole enterprise succeeds effortlessly. Certain scenes are quite sublime (the visit of the 'Carpenter', for example); the acting first-class, and the vision disciplined -I use that term advisedly! Please see it for yourself; at least you will not find anything else very like it."
" The Puke of Burgundy
",-0.5267,-0.0754,2018-05-21 00:00:00,1,"This is extremely slow paced and boring movie and it is very hard to sit thru the entire movie. It certainly has no mystery element nor is it a drama. It's a documentation of lesbian relationship of 2 characters who were on screen for 99% of the movie and 1% was any other characters altogether. Watch if you have certain sexual preferences as you may find it a bit interesting, otherwise it is a Boredom of Burgundy."
" The scream of the butterfly
",-0.4019,-0.1461,2018-02-06 00:00:00,4,"Nothing like a lesbian artsy film filled with insect metaphors to bring out the curmudgeon in me. I might even include a plot spoiler or two although I am not sure the film had a plot.Cynthia (Sidse Babett Knudsen) and Evelyn (Chiara D'Anna) are lovers and entomologists in a community of female entomologists which seems to represent some sort on insect community or perhaps it is the other way around. At home Cynthia is the queen bee while Evelyn is the submissive drone. Although we eventually find out Evelyn enjoys being the drone more than Cynthia enjoys being dominant...whose the naughty girl. It is a light S&M relationship that bored me to tears. It reminded me of an old Italian film , especially the sound track.I didn't get anything out of it.Guide: No swearing or nudity. Some F/F sex."
" A Boring Masterpiece
",0.4215,-0.9687,2017-12-26 00:00:00,6,"I can understand why this movie is so highly regarded by critics. But deep down, I'm just your average movie enthusiast that still loves stupid movies with badass guys shooting bad guys with big guns. Sure there are time I'm really into some cult movies, but they are cult for a reason and that's because most people don't enjoy them, because most people love stupid movies with badass guys shooting bad guys with big guns. It's unfair, but that's how it goes.
When watching The Duke of Burgundy I never expected it to be a mainstream movie, but even so I can't help feeling let down. However, let me start by what's good in this movie: The first thing I noticed was the atmosphere. Dark but ironically so, colorful. The slow unravel of the relationship's intricacies and, yet again, slow build up to the inevitable emotional breakdown, were carefully crafted, that is obvious talent right there.
Nevertheless, personally, it failed to deliver the emotional impact it promised, leaving no lasting impressions or afterthoughts on the subject the movie was centered on. There was a surreal dream sequence that, in my opinion, did not fit the movie, and even if you can have an interpretation out of it, it felt misplaced and pretentious.
On some levels, this movie reminded me of Shame, but where shame got it right, this one felt bland and unclear.
As far as enjoyment goes, this movie failed me. It was boring. Good but boring."
" Butterfly Effect
",0.0,0.8397,2017-11-06 00:00:00,6,"Titled after a butterfly native to Britain, this intense drama focuses on a romantic relationship between two entomologists that begins to crumble as their role playing takes an emotional strain on the woman forced to play dominant by her masochistic girlfriend. Lusciously photographed, with several shots that slowly travel up and down butterfly displays, and beginning with opening credits in the fashion of a late 1960s or early 1970s movie, 'The Duke of Burgundy' is a visually arresting experience and the detailed costumes are impressive too. The film also benefits from a lack of exposition; at first, the submissive woman appears to the dominant's maid and our preconceptions are further challenged as it is slowly revealed that the submissive one has all control in the relationship, often uncomfortably coaxing her lover into improvising speeches and punishments to help her achieve satisfaction. Interesting as all this might sound, the completely non-explicit way that their interactions are filmed takes away much of the intimacy with no nudity and precious few moments of them close together. The repetitiveness of their routines also grows tiresome, if somewhat appropriately so to reflect the dominant one's disenchantment with their affair. Certainly, there is enough of interest here to make the film worth a look, but one's mileage will probably vary."
" An ode to 1970s sexploitation films minus the sex and exploitation
",0.0,0.9694,2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"Duke of Burgundy takes the concept of old sadomasochistic lesbian movies and digs deeper to the psychology of its characters. The director is trying to do what the legendary Jess Franco and Jean Rollin often did with their lesbo shockers, but he is not as successful. But its a wonderful experiment that works on many levels. The cinematography are acting are very sharp. The plot is thin and not much action takes place and it all could've been a much better short film, but its well written and directed anyway.The most interesting part of the film is the suggestion that lesbianism is a kind of fetish and psychological crutch for emotionally damaged people. He likens its roots to the roots of S&M. This is a very controversial angle in our modern times, but I think its refreshing. Duke of Burgundy is not a sentimental, pandering or fetishistic examination of its subjects. Its a very cold and analytical one. And its interest and sympathy for its characters are more pure than the films that inspired it. I only wish it was as exciting and entertaining as Vampyros Lesbos or Rape of the Vampire. But maybe it wouldn't work as well if it was as exploitative."
" Scenes From a Marriage
",0.0,0.2954,2017-05-29 00:00:00,9,"About 25 minutes into this film we abruptly learn that the dynamics of the relationship between these two women is far from what it at first seems; and 'The Duke of Burgundy' becomes an engrossing emotional drama about a relationship in crisis. Sidse Babett Knudsen and Chiara D'Anna are both wondrous as the two glamorous lipstick lesbians - especially when their magnificent bone structures are photographed in close up or in profile - and the film doesn't stint on cool girl-on-girl action (there's much zipping up and unzipping of boots, and the film appropriately has credits for both perfume and lingerie). The older, more sophisticated Cynthia (Knudsen), however, is tiring of being required daily to play out the same scenario in which she has to bully her younger lover Evelyn (D'Anna), who remains stubbornly oblivious of the strain this is placing upon Cynthia. Cynthia (presumably in a nod towards Vladimir Nabokov) lectures on butterflies and moths before an all-woman audience attired & coiffed with the same buttoned-down elegance as the two leads. (The only male cast members are the dead insect specimens pinned to pieces of card.) The period is unclear (Cynthia writes her lectures on a very old-fashioned manual typewriter) but vaguely resembles the 1970s of hothouse sapphist fare like 'Daughters of Darkness', 'Die Bitteren Tr√§nen der Petra von Kant' and exploitation films like 'Vampyros Lesbos'. (Much of 'The Duke of Burgundy' resembles a vampire film without vampires.)Cynthia's mounting disinclination to keep up with Evelyn's insatiable demands for stimulation is exacerbated by back trouble, (as Victoria Wood once famously put it, ""You know I pulled a muscle when I did that grouting"",) which means that she's now spending a lot of time slouching about in pyjamas rather than a corset and stockings when not being woken up in the night by Evelyn because of her snoring (although Knudsen still looks chic even in pyjamas without her wig.) Neither Knudsen or D'Anna's first language is English, which lends a certain unreality to their enunciation; but both actresses are extremely eloquent with their eyes and facial expressions. The crowning moment comes with Cynthia's sudden tearful disintegration at her inability to continue for the umpteenth time with yet another of Evelyn's endless roleplays."
" An usually hidden side of the sub-dom fantasy, with a dash of poetry.
",0.0,0.9798,2017-05-11 00:00:00,7,"I like watching movies without reading the synopsis first, that way I was surprised after the suspenseful first scenes of the movie. I thought I was about to watch a relationship unfold, when in reality, it was already way past its honeymoon phase.Submission and domination, but who's really in charge? Cynthia, who's the older in the relationship, feels just so afraid of loneliness she has adjusted to the high and super specific demands of his younger sub, Evelyn. Cynthia cages herself in tight corsets and thights, scripts and an exhausting way of living provided by her lover, and it doesn't come off natural to her. To make insatiable Evelyn happy, she sleeps alone at night and has to still remain watchful in case the word that haunts her comes out of the cage. ""Pinastri"". And on again the next day, when Evelyn finds something new (or wants to revive the old desires) and demands her lover to pull the act. Cynthia becomes frustrated trying, but still does, in fear of losing her only one.I loved the romance and aesthetic. The butterfly studies give it a poetic magic. I didn't like certain pauses in the movie that kind of made it bland, but I still believe is a highly recommended film for those interested in ""unusual love"" and sexuality movies."
" Are you kidding me?
",0.1027,-0.6908,2017-02-15 00:00:00,1,I started to watch this after googling to watch something good. What the hell is the point of this film? I pity every single person who thought there was a single aspect of this film worthy of note. What the hell is going on with the gay/lesbian/human world that thinks that's worth watching.
