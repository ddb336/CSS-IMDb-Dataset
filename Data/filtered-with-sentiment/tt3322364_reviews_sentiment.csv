" 5 Years On and Still Playing!
",0.2714,0.9936,2021-02-20 00:00:00,9,"This is a very powerful film with great performances particularly from Will Smith and David Morse. It is heart-breaking to see what happens to some of the players who ""had it all"" and were destroyed by CTE.I found the presentation and explanation of CTE to be fascinating in a ""common sense"" kind of way. But the disease's lack of identifiable physical evidence for the symptoms was also fascinating.. like a demonic possession or something... that is until our hero discovers the source.A well done telling of a story based on true events... though as with many films of this nature, I have to wonder just how many liberties they took in the name of dramatic effect and character development that weren't necessarily true but served to make their point rather than remain purely factual. This dangerous fine-line of ""poetic license"" is a slippery slope and can serve to undermine the credibility of the story but in this case, I do not believe it went that far.Will Smith is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. I had pretty much written off the ""Fresh Prince"" after seeing a few very disappointing films of his (not that his acting was bad, I just didn't like the films). But recently, I have gone back in time and watched his under-appreciated masterpiece ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" and that movie completely changed my opinion of Will Smith as a serious actor. He proves again in his role in Concussion, that he has the skill and talent to play very diverse and complex characters... not just a wise-cracking, bullet-spewing undercover cop with a knack for offing bad white guys.The last scene is very powerful as he watches two kids collide on the football practice field leaving him and the audience with the lingering question: ""Will anything really change?"" Five years after the movie (and more since the actual discovery of CTE) nothing really has. We don't hear about it anymore and the NFL is doing its best to get players and fans back to the game as we muddle our way out of the China Virus. Maybe some things shouldn't come back. But then, I never was a big football fan so what do I know.The acting, characters, dialog and love-interest all serve to make the story engaging and immersive. The way the movie brings out the humanity (or lack thereof) of the stakeholders is very well done, particularly in the case of the affected players who have been all but abandoned by the the corporation they made millions for (and millions from).The biggest change to football in regards to CTE is now the disclosure of the fact that CTE is a thing, and if you want to play football, you are now forewarned and accept the risks of developing CTE. Not unlike the well-documented affects boxing has on the brains of fighters over time. With enough blows to the head, you just might develop brain damage.. go figure. Seems logical that the same would apply to football players... but hey, they wear helmets, right? While a helmet may protect from cracked skulls and surface abrasions, it doesn't do much of anything to protect the brain that sloshes around violently when the skull is impacted hard enough, with or without ""protection.""So, has CTE meaningfully changed the sport? I'd say for all intents and purposes, it hasn't made a dent (pun intended). COVID, the game's conversion to a stage for radical leftist politics and shifting entertainment preferences will and are doing more to damage the sport than CTE."
" Opinion on Concussion
",0.0,0.9392,2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"First of all I think that Concussion has a good casting, Will Smith and Alec Baldwin worked really good on screen, the acting of Will Smith, specially his nigerian accent is really good, photography is quite interesting, the colors represent some type of Grey felling in the air, good movie, maybe top 10 of Will Smith movies."
" Tangled Disordered Film
",0.0,0.9055,2021-02-13 00:00:00,5,"Dr Omalu,a Pittsburgh pathologist, leads a crusade against the NFL when he uncovers the deadly effects of concussions. The film spans a couple of years and many of the events that took place in that time. And more than once it brings up references to Big Tobbacco and the lawsuits filed against it. A movie also made off of that as well:The Insider. The real life events certainly share some similarities but more ironically so do the films. Perhaps this is because the actual events are alike but these two film similar structures and flaws. Concussion fails to draw a clear line through all the events and is very disordered and disjointed. It isn't always entirely clear on what is happening,why or what it means. Other scenes aren't so inscrutable but they simply dont serve any real purpose. They just further slow down and already slow film. And by the end you might have to ask yourself how it all started because in all the lengthy confusion,you simply forgot. The Insider bears many of the same shortcomings.
All the viewer has, to cling on to in this tangled picture is Will Smith's performance. Perhaps it isn't something you'll be talking about for years to come, Smith gives a suprisingly good performance;considering he's spent most of his career doing comedy and action.
While Concussion does shine the light it strives to on CTE and football. It doesn't have quite the impact it could if it was just a little better executed."

" A rare 10/10 Will Smith movie
",0.0,0.9673,2020-11-28 00:00:00,10,"Concussion is about former nfl players getting concussions. A doctor from across the ocean discovers the cause. The doctor means well and is trying help people and families however...
Like always the authorities play the villain (no one notices). They try to stop him from doing what is right. The NFL tries to cover up the concussions and try to play like they have nothing to do with the unforeseen circumstances.It Is rare for Willard Smith to be seen playing a different character since The Pursuit of Happyness. He has been playing the same cocky, sarcastic, loudmouth character for years. The Concussion shows that this guy can actually act. I thought he couldn't for awhile. So why doesn't put on more performances like this one?The movie has a very light navy blue colour to it. Its a warm true story movie.
The characters are done well.
The Music is soft and elegantVerdict: A movie for the smart people. Anyone else would not be interested.My opinion: If you chose to play a ""dangerous"" sport. Then its on you. Do your research. People always want to blame others other than themselves. I mean its football. What do you expect hugs and flowers?"
" And Justice For All
",0.5267,0.8519,2020-10-27 00:00:00,10,"Will Smith portrays real-life Bennet Omalu, an idealist Nigerian-American doctor, whose findings in an autopsy leads him to fight the corporate avarice of the NFL industry, in the name of Ethics, Science, Truth and Justice.
It takes a years-long struggle and several (ex-)players to die before justice is finally served, both for the dead and those who have survived.
A brilliant piece of filmmaking that takes on toxic profits made at the expense of Health and Life. Like in Michael Mann's 'The Insider' (1999) - against The Poison Cartel: Tobacco Industry - and Todd Haynes' 'Dark Waters' (2019) - against The Poison Cartel: Chemical/Pesticides Industry - it is an essential message of public awareness about Ethics and Respect: Respect for Self, Others, Our Environment, Our Health and Our Life."

" Brilliant true story
",0.765,0.8221,2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"Really enjoyed this film which had excellent acting all round and managed to pull off a film that told a true story of the potential brain damage that can occur in American football and the sad deaths of some players. The moral of the story is about the truth and the difficulties individuals in life go through to tell the truth, regardless of religion or race. It reminded me of the film ""The Insider"" which looked at the truth behind the Tobacco industry and the lengths they went through to stop the truth coming out."
" super movie with brilliant actors doing expert acting work and great direction
",0.9153,0.9926,2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,"Saw this ""Concussion"" movie three times and I want to view it again. That desire to view again means it's A Great Movie! I've seen Will Smith, David Morse, Alec Baldwin, Albert Brooks, Richard Jones in other good movies, but in my opinion, this ""Concussion"" movie is their best acting job out of them all. Also, of course, the director, Mr. Landesman, I must say, did a great job. The female actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw reminds me of the professional good actresses Jada Pinkett and Halle Berry, women that are strikingly beautiful yet concentrated wonderful actors. It was a real life fact-based movie, but the reason it is loved is because it was so well done. Some movies are mediocre and don't hold attention or some allow for distractions that cut it short. But not this one. This is one of the greats, a movie that must be watched to the end, and then applauded. Other reviewers write about how the NFL will be affected or will cause a bad effect on the movie just as it caused a bad effect on Dr. Bennet Omalu's life. But my writing here has no political or commercial bias. I actually prefer football out of all popular American sports. Football is a fantastic game to see, the same as ""Concussion"" is a fantastic movie to watch."
" Revealing the truth
",0.3182,0.6652,2020-07-02 00:00:00,7,This is a real story that truly happened. An African immingrant neuropathologist doctor reveals something that the powerful NFL (National Football League) in USA tried to conceal: that the frequent concussions between players in football games caused brain damage and subsequent deaths in some cases. The powerful NFL and its allies start a campaign against him trying to show that he is scientifically wrong. The movie style is more narrative than dramatic but it portrays well enough the courageous fight of the pathologist doctor to prove that he is right.
" Ignaz Semmelweis
",0.0,0.9394,2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,"Movie shows how the desire for money can override science in regard to what people know, or think they know. People's desire for money, the greedy desire for more than one needs, can cause people to hide the truth, and to attack the truth-tellers. The movie does a pretty good job of this. It creates suspense. This movie shows this desire not winning out in the end, but sometimes it does. Things did not turn out as well for Ignaz Semmelweis, as it did for Dr Omalu, when Dr Semmelweis discovered the reason for the ""childbed fever"" that was killing so many women after they gave birth. The other doctors, the ones who thought washing their hands was unnecessary, got together and managed to get Semmelweis locked up inside what we would call a ""mental hospital"" today. So that they could continue going right from the dissection of cadavers to delivering babies, without washing their hands in between.Dr Omalu managed to avoid having Dr Semmelweis' fate happen to him. The movie showed that this result was not inevitable. He managed to avoid this fate perhaps only by the skin of his teeth. There were times when he thought his attackers might get the best of him. We have a happy ending here, in this particular story, but the movie made me wonder how often we get the other result: when desire for money wins out over the desire for truth.Well-told suspenseful story."
" Concussion (2015)
",0.0,-0.9186,2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,"This film is one of Will Smith's new films that tries to bring him back to the film scene but fails to bring his usual dramatic style and substance may be due to lack of innovation in the film in my perspective.The film builds on an ordinary doctor who builds a case on NFL players and the unsafe nature of the sport due to the inherent concussions occured in the sport where in the long run creates a dangerous effect and create suicidal impacts to the sportsman and when Dr. Bennet Omalu (palyed by Will Smith) an immigrant from Africa discloses this in a medical magazine he faces a lot of threats and many negative impacts from the AFL making his personal and professional life destroyed and but later his theory was proved by the public making his sacrifice worthwhile.The only reason the film didn't worked out was in my opinion was that when I watched it, it reminded me of ""The Insider (1998)"" which was a similar premise but was well executed. But it had some good dialogues and also a unique approach to sports films. Still the impact of the later film I established in the review gives me a lower standard to this film due to it's lack of execution as per the other movie.Anyway if you love Will Smith you're going to watch this anyway and he pulls of a good film.Overall - 3.5/5"
" Too soon, there's still more story to be told
",0.0,-0.2612,2020-04-27 00:00:00,6,"Concussion is a film about one of the doctors who officially reported on the damaging effects that playing football can have on the human brain. It is a truly fascinating topic, even for someone like myself who is a big fan of the sport. Yes, I can enjoy being a spectator while still recognizing that it is probably a horribly unsafe thing for people to do with their bodies. Somewhat early on, this film has a great visual illustration to show the dangers of playing decades of football on the human mind, and I don't know if it ever gets as compelling as that one moment. Will Smith does his best to play Dr. Bennet Omalu, although the character is a bit understated and measured. While he has moments of passion, his personality isn't as bold as I'd like for the lead in this kind of biopic. I wish Albert Brooks and Alec Baldwin were in the film a bit more because their interactions with Smith were some of the most exciting scenes in the film. I've never been a huge fan of biopics, but there's one big reason that I think this one is a bit underwhelming...A podcaster I know said it best: ""The biggest problem with Concussion is that the whole story hasn't been written yet."" There is so much more that will probably change in the coming years as the NFL is forced to continue exploring the best route to player safety, and as more truth is revealed from those who were in the inner circle of the league. Don't get me wrong, it's not that there is no value in exploring Dr. Omalu's part in putting a name on CTE, or publishing his findings so that it would come to the attention of the national media. The problem is, he is not the most important player in this whole thing. The film tried to make it small by focusing on his story, but it's really a massive tale of corruption and greed that has infected an entire sport. I didn't even like how Concussion addressed the dangerous push-back Omalu received. It seemed like minor annoyances with the occasional threat, then all of the sudden it cranks up to a devastating level with little warning. I don't want to totally discredit Concussion, because it tells a relevant story that some people may need to see, but I simply feel it isn't as effective as it could be, or perhaps will be in the future."
" Important subject matter.
",0.2263,0.146,2020-04-21 00:00:00,5,"It's a very important story, although with all these types of films I'm always wondering mid-movie which parts are based on what really happened and which are the 'Hollywood jazz hands' entertainment parts, to make things more ""exciting"". The film wasn't bad, don't get me wrong... But for me, it was a bit slow and so I found my attention wandering a little bit at times.
And then it's just one of those things, but I found Will Smiths accent distracting, meaning I wasn't really bought in. Hence, 5/10 or 2 and a half stars."
" Interesting and captivating!
",0.4574,0.9258,2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"Concussion is a very interesting watch! I was glad to find that most of it was accurate to the real story. Will Smith was a class act as always, securing another movie, as to why he one of the best.Its sad to think that since some of these findings in the early 2000's that sport hasn't had drastic change to the rules and penalising of players within all contact sport. I'd be intrigued to see whether these reports and movies have resulted in less sport participation, I'd imagine it hasn't really.Great movie to watch with a group, and right my alley in terms of a true story, excellent actors and you feel like you learn something once you've watched it."
" Danger of Morden day sports business , ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10

" In Spanish the title is ""The truth is painful"" but in the pockets of the magnates
",-0.0772,0.4779,2020-01-28 00:00:00,8,"We always learn with good films, and this is the case. Dr Omalu (Will Smith) asserted that many animals have better protection of their head and brain than the human being, e.g. the tongue of the woodpecker extends through the back of the mouth out of the nostril, surrounding the entire skull, which becomes a kind of safety belt for that vital organ. The human being has none of that, you hit your head and you stay with the blow, which in the medium term will bring fatal consequences, many more if repeated weekly. The film is a clear evidence of the abuse of the human being in American football, sport causing several deaths for the same reason. The NFL's attitude is quite similar to that of cigarette producers in the 1990s. They denied all the damage that tobacco caused to human health. The racial aspect is again addressed in the film. Dr Omalu arrived in the US with an idea, which later changed. Good acting of Will Smith and Alec Baldwin, both demonstrated one again their versatility to play different roles."

It depicts a corruption grown to obscene height and breadth and depth.It further depicts, vividly, the purity and professionalism of a very committed, enormously credentialed doctor.When the two entities collided, the viewer is left to draw their own conclusions. To do so, they must reckon with the person in the mirror. They must confront their own morality.Which is more important? Preservation of life, or perpetuation of a multi-billion dollar corporation without GENUINE heart and soul.The viewer can make up their own mind."

" Why Did This Not Find An Audience?

Even him saying ""Tell the truuuth"" was all I could recall from the trailers. I vaguely knew the plot of the movie and that was it.I missed out on one of the best movies of 2015. Smith delivers a great performance, as does everyone else Alec Baldwin who I have never been a fan of is great, as is Albert Brooks David Morse and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.You don't need to follow American Football to understand what is going on, as I have never watched a full game in my life, let alone played it. The science is all easy to understand as is the frustration and sadness you feel watching this. It's a slow burner for sure, and I'm sure some people may find it boring, but I never did. It reminded me a bit of The Insider, instead of Tabacco companies it's the NFL who are the moral bad guys.Concussion is Will Smith's best movie since Seven Pounds, and sadly like that movie, this one did not find an audience either. Concussion grossed $34 million at the domestic box office, to end 2015 as the 75th highest grossing movie of the year."

" Real life medical mystery: ""banging heads is not a natural thing""
",-0.2755,0.9942,2019-04-05 00:00:00,9,"The NFL, America's largest football (and sports) league, an estimated $9.5 billion/year industry, has a secret. A secret the league office and Management Council have been reluctant to investigate too deeply and one they've wished would go away quietly: former football stars, men still in their healthy years, are suffering from memory loss, insomnia, hearing voices, seeing double, blinding headaches, raging and destructively violent outbursts-leaving them debilitated and incapable of carrying out their normal lives.Dr. Julian Bailes, a trusted former team doctor cannot understand why his ex-football player patients are having these symptoms and not responding to medication. ""Is there something that I'm missing?"" he asks in frustration when all tests seem normal for iconic, former Pittsburgh Steeler and inductee into the Hall of Fame, ""Iron"" Mike Webster now living on the streets and sleeping in his trash-strewn pickup truck. Not too long after, the former titan on the field, like several other ex-players, kills himself and his body arrives at the Coroners', forensic neuropathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu. Alive the body revealed nothing, but in death the answers can be found.Former conflict and investigative journalist (read ""A Woman's Work,"" New York Times, September 15, 2002), awarded painter and now director Peter Landesman specialized in following gritty stories on trafficking (human, sex, drugs, weapons, art and refugee) and so his portrayal of the NFL tactics against Nigerian-immigrant Dr. Omalu to keep the research results buried, which include threatening his employment and immigration status, are very realistic and current and the use of live footage throughout the movie keeps the tension well-paced and building.Will Smith (Fresh Prince of Belair, Men in Black, Ali) Oscar and Grammy winner among numerous other awards, portrays the numerous degreed and prolifically (medically) specialized Omalu in a way that is quiet, somber, reflective, distinguished and earnest. The new immigrant from Kenya for whom Omalu provides room and board at the request of his pastor, and who he later marries, is Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi, registered nurse Prema Mutiso portrayed by Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Jupiter Ascending, Beyond the Lights, Belle) African-American Film Critics Association (AAFCA) and Black Film Critics Circle award winner among others. Their relationship seems too restrained and unemotional, except when Omalu shows her the site of the home he intends to build, part of the fruition of his American Dream. In fact more passion is shown by the ex-NFL player Justin Strzelczyk (by Matthew Willig) who, with one hand, lifts his wife up by the throat in front of their children, and tells her that the voices in his head are ordering him to kill her. Alex Baldwin (30 Rock, The Cooler, It's Complicated) Oscar and BAFTA nominated, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and Primetime Emmy recipient, gives a wonderfully realistic portrayal of a doctor (Bailes) who wishes to help his patients but knows that any negative publicity to the image of the NFL will be extremely dangerous.Smith and Mbatha-Raw accents are not easily identifiable as Nigerian or Kenyan, but definitely inform the viewer that the speaker is not American-raised. The dialogue is impactful: Omalu, as he prepares to splice the brain of one of America's most beloved sports figures, responds to those who see his efforts as over-zealous, ""the dead are my patients"" and reminds them that he is bound to be thorough by the Hippocratic Oath.This real life medical mystery, David and Goliath story, is very realistically presented. An important docudrama of a significant finding by an African-born doctor researching an American institution, the death of a champion (""Iron"" Mike Webster brilliantly portrayed by David Morse) from the team with the most Super Bowl championships (the Pittsburgh Steelers), it's a shame it was not nominated for an Oscar 2016, but has been awarded elsewhere none the less. As Webster in his Hall of Fame acceptance speech said, ""banging heads is not a natural thing""... the world waits to see if 'Concussion' has any effect on high-impact contact sports."
" Good story, poor writing
",-0.0516,0.8079,2019-02-22 00:00:00,5,"The movie's writing is lazy and poor. I understand that this movie is ""based on a true story"", but that doesn't excuse it's boring nature and lack of drama for a drama movie. This movie envokes no feeling in the viewer and fails to balance the secondary love plot and the main story. I also found it hard to keep track of time, the easiest being watching Will Smith's hair grey, nice detail. This is the sort of film that you watch because nothing else is on. Solid 5/10"

",0.6588,0.9717,2019-02-05 00:00:00,7,"I don't know if Will Smith's nigerian accent gets close to the original, but its musicality is very pleasing. It's also very nice to be reminded that Will Smith can acts very well when he bothers to choose some decent script. David Morse was incredible as Mark Webster, I wish he had more scenes the movie. Albert Brooks and Eddie Marson were also great even in smal roles. Alec Baldwin is always Alec Baldwin, always in the same kind of character."

But besides that, I agree whole heartedly with the 28 Dec. 2015 reviewer's statements about how good this movie and true story is. I am shocked that there has not been many more positive reviews by many more people, especially with as many football fans as there are out there. I didn't know about this movie when it came out. but I saw it on tv last night, and was blown away by both the true story (which I also didn't know about), and the movie.
Now I know how the new rule on targeting and helmet to helmet rule came about. I am now researching to learn more about Dr. Bennet Omalu and his story."

In the same year that the Academy gave a best actor nod to Matt Damon for arguably playing himself in The Martian, it is a travesty that they ignored Smith's performance in Concussion."

" This Hard Hitting drama, indeed left an impact in the Sport World. It was a mind altering movie.
",-0.1027,-0.997,2018-10-11 00:00:00,7,"This motion picture is not your typical sport movie. Instead of focusing on compelling athletes competing in a physical game. This movie based off true events is more about ongoing debate over player safety within the sport of football, and exposing the dark extreme lengths, the oppositions would do in denying the obvious link between a brain disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and football related head injuries. While the movie written & directed by Peter Landesman tries really hard to tell a good story; it has been criticized for not being truthful to the actual events; such in the case, how the motion picture made up a number of fake adversaries for Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) to fight against. One of them, was the FBI. While, it's true, that the bureau raided Bennet's boss, Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks) for corruption; what's untruth, is that it was instructed by officials of the NFL, in order to scare the doctor. In reality, both organizations had little working ties. Even if they did, the case with Cyril has nothing to do with the concussion result; as the raid occurred three months prior to Omalu's publishing his finding. Another misleading information, create by the film was the indication that the doctor & his wife, Prema (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) suffer a miscarriage & were driven out of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, due to the fears over the federal's retaliation. In reality, not only did they not suffer a miscarriage, they rarely got harassment like that. Authenticity, Dr. Bennet and the government has really good relationship with each other, to the point, that the doctor appear in court as a witness for the prosecution & also offer to become the next chief medical examiner for Washington D.C. Choosing not to get into politics, the forensic pathologist turn down the offer, in order to stay within the city to tried to go after Wecht's job. The only reason, why Bennet left Pittsburgh and move to California, was, because he didn't get that job. It has nothing to do with the government, nor the people, he work with. In real-life, Bennet barely had any combative coworker like Daniel Sullivan (Mike O'Malley) at the coroner's office; as he often work, by himself. As for, the other threats, his family got, in the film like from ex-football player, Dave Duerson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). It's also inaccurate. In real life, Duerson did not harm Bennet with mob like death threats. He only discredit the doctor's findings, whenever, he was talking to the public; which was rarely, as he didn't really work for NFL at the time; due to a business venture, in the retail food industry. Indeed, the negative light toward him, was somewhat incorrect & highly exaggerated. Likewise, Dr. Joseph Maroon (Arliss Howard)'s portrayal in the movie is also highly sensationalized. While, it's true that the neurosurgeon did deny any relationship between football concussions and Omalu's findings. In the defense of him, he did more to treat and prevented concussions than anybody, specifically in football, by establishing the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment Cognitive Testing and discovering ""burning hands"" syndrome. In truth, he was no football stooge. He fought against the system; along with executive director, Christopher Nowinski, whom was not even mention in this movie. It's sad, because the Concussion Legacy Foundation played an integral role in discovering brain damage within football players. Sucks that, they were omitted. Another problem with the film is that the players suffering from this brain disease, also doesn't get enough screen time. The film might have worked better, if they did. I really wanted to know, more about their stories & rather than seeing the protagonist fight made up villains. They really drop the ball here. Also, structurally, the movie had really bad pacing. There is no indication of time moving, at all. A good example of this, is the doctor's relationship with his wife. It felt rushed and underdeveloped, as Raw isn't given, much to do, as a performer. Her fairly superficially written character is only there to give moral support. When in truth, Bennet's wife did more; such as help him, document his work, by taking photographs. Also, unlike the movie, Prema did not initially live with Bennet, during her first few months in United States. She live on her own. While, it's true, that she did go to the same church as Bennet. Sparks didn't fly, until they met at a party, later on. Having her live with the doctor from the get go, looks very creepy & odd. It's sad, because, scenes like that, including all the religionist talk, toward dead people made Bennet seem more like African Warlord, 'Joseph Kony' style religionist zealot than a normal stocky American common man of faith. It doesn't help that Smith plays a generalized African accent that sounds over the top & cheesy. It's so unlike the real doctor, whom has a cooler Americanized accent. It's a really odd choice, just like, how Nigerian born, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is playing an American football player. It's doesn't add up. Another problem with the film is the science is not as accuracy as it should had been. While, it's true that CTE and Concussions are brain injuries. They are not the same. Each have very different conditions. A concussion is a suddenly acute brain injury caused by a blow to the head, while CTE is repeated brain trauma cause degeneration over time. Also, not every concussion leads to CTE damage. Nor can, CTE really be all, to blame for the suicides of several former athletes. Let's not forget that, many other factors, outside of football, also led to these tragedies; such mental illness, drug use, bad relationships, numerous lawsuits and financial problems. However, these things are not explore. In the end, while, 'Concussion' didn't tackle the subject matter as good as 2012's documentary, 'Head Games'. This movie still needs to be seen for any sport fan. Just note, it's no touchdown. At least, it's no fumble."

This is quite the typical sports drama which is based on real events as real people. It is clear that the studios and actors thought this film was Oscar worthy, but it ended up being a failure at that part not receiving any nominations. This film isn't bad but for one it is an acquired taste that many people are not seriously into, and as a result we have seen this film flop at the box office (which isn't a complete surprise).Will Smith's acting is good, as with the rest of the cast but overall it seems somewhat forgettable in the end. There are several intriguing moments in the film but as a whole, nothing in which we have not seen in sports drama's. Recommend but do not set your expectations too high."

Yes they have some answers but not even close to all of them. This is why we need to better understand why people do what they do and why!Great movie to Will and all involved!

The same can be said for most the movies key folk.Perhaps if Ridley had the directing role it could have lifted the film.

Even him saying ""Tell the truuuth"" was all I could recall from the trailers. I vaguely knew the plot of the movie and that was it. I missed out on one of the best movies of 2015. Smith delivers a great performance, as does everyone else Alec Baldwin who I have never been a fan of is great, as is Albert Brooks David Morse and Gugu Mbatha-Raw. You don't need to follow American Football to understand what is going on, as I have never watched a full game in my life, let alone played it. The science is all easy to understand as is the frustration and sadness you feel watching this. Concussion is Will Smith's best movie since Seven Pounds, and sadly like that movie, this one did not find an audience either.

For the important message alone, it is a huge win to have this film shot with a high budget and a remarkable cast. Unfortunately, the side effects of this high production value are that the movie follows the basic Hollywood principles. The story is surely worth being told but it is dramatized and interwoven with personal emotions in a way that sometimes seems to have been created mainly for the big screen. This way the sports plot gets a touch of American dream and becomes the tale of an unsung hero, that occasionally comes a bit too close to the mainstream.All in all this is an important movie produced in a way that makes it look like most Blockbusters.

Although he was probably most responsible for extending it to American style football in his 2006 paper.""CTE was originally studied in boxers in the 1920s as dementia pugilistica. The seminal work on the disease came from British neurologist Macdonald Critchley, who in 1949 wrote a paper titled ""Punch-drunk syndromes: the chronic traumatic encephalopathy of boxers.""

" Head-butting
",0.0,0.9828,2017-10-25 00:00:00,8,"Will Smith, Alec Baldwin, and Arthur Brooks star in ""Concussion"" from 2015. Smith plays Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian working in Pittsburgh as a coroner, who was the first to publish on the effect of multiple head injuries in football players, with players developing dementia, committing suicide, and using drugs. His boss is Dr. Cyril Wecht (Brooks).Of course I read the comments from the obvious deniers but also supportive ones from some football players. First of all, it makes sense that multiple head injuries would lead to some kind of problem. Hello. Natasha Richardson was wearing a helmet, fell while skiing, and became brain dead. That was just one hit in the head.The NFL didn't see it that way, satisfied I guess with throwing dogs down elevator shafts and coming to the conclusion that football wasn't dangerous. Omalu financed the testing on the brain of football player Mike Webster, who wound up homeless and demented, and saw the syndrome, which he named CTE - chronic traumatic encephalopathy So Dr. Omalu was in a peck of trouble, particularly in a football town like Pittsburgh. He published his findings in 2002; the NFL never even acknowledged there was a connection between CTE and football until 2009. When they couldn't convince Omalu to retract his findings, Roger Goodell set up a commission but Omalu was not allowed in the room; instead, his findings were presented by a former NFL doctor (Baldwin) who is helping him. It was all a big set-up so they could act like they cared. They didn't. They do now but just barely.I found this an excellent film with a wonderful performance by Will Smith. It was based on the eponymous book, which arose out of an article in GQ about what Omalu ran into with the NFL. The film takes certain dramatic licensing so some of the incidents or their timing is not accurate, but the general story is.The film demonstrates, as if we didn't know, that the NFL considers itself God and uses its influence in all sorts of ways, some I'm sure good, and others not so good. Many years ago I was involved in a discussion with a group that wanted to present an award at a Superbowl, maybe a 30-second thing. Basically they were told the NFL didn't have to do anything for them and why would they. After all, isn't the almighty dollar the only thing anyone in the U.S. cares about? Watching the last scene in this film, I was left disgusted. I hope many parents have gotten the message. Then again, I suppose with the millions of dollars you can make, losing your mind is a small price to pay."

Will Smith's character is exceptionally beyond acting and it could pass for real. I had not heard of this story until I watched this movie. Apparently this happened a long, long time ago (before I begin watching the NFL games). I was very young then, but I loved watching the game and still do, even though the dangers of the game are so real. I also had not heard of CTE until the most recent Aaron Hernandez ordeal during his time with the New England Patriiots. I am a NE Patriot fan and I truly loved his time with my team. He was an instrumental piece of the NE offense and he was highly admired. What causes us to do things that are so extreme? I'll never understand. But if you don't know about the dangers of playing for the NFL and what the players might go through, this is a must-watch movie to get a better understanding of what CTE is and why it might cause certain outcomes."

This is one such film. I think Will Smith has truly grown as a serious actor over the years, with this as his crowning achievement, in my view.

Thus, this film was on my must-see list, but it felt a little bit obligatory for that reason. I was expecting kind of a dry, medical progress sort of story, with the scientific hero establishing new insights (and, of course, being recognized, sooner or later, for doing so). While that's kind of true in the final analysis, the story is actually about power and belief, including the struggle to change a system in which the very behaviours that create devastating brain injuries are glorified, celebrated --- and commercialized. That truth has few champions is a recurring story in every field of human endeavour, not just at the junction of science, healthcare and sports. But it is easy to forget how unpopular and unwelcome truth so commonly is, and the many reasons why this is so. On an additional note, Will Smith outdid himself in exhibiting his capacity to portray a character who is obviously not a mere variation of ""himself."" He succeeds at placing himself imaginatively into a character who is somewhat distinctive and, more than that, not at all a North American stereotype --- that is, a successful immigrant who had established much of his success before he ever got here, and was then stymied in the United States by cultural forces whose nature, ultimately, is alien to his own background and experience. In short, this was not a dry, scientific progress story; rather a gripping drama of struggle and hard-won victory --- and still only partially-won."

The story mainly followed the doctors' life and his research as well as the hurdles placed in his way as he was potentially damaging the NFL's reputation and revenue stream.

It didn't seem to make major, shocking headlines, possibly because everyone knows football is tough.But the NFL's stance was/is no surprise, knowing human nature.

" Melodrama masquerading as expose
",-0.1531,-0.824,2017-06-10 00:00:00,4,"This is a well-made film about an important subject. Unfortunately it degenerates into a polemic against the National Football League, elevating its principal character from forensic brain specialist to crusading hero to martyr, all the while taking liberties with basic facts in service of a narrative. One such basic fact concerns Mike Webster, on whom the first portion of the movie focuses. Webster was the victim of child abuse with mental illness on both sides of the family. He had a history of substance abuse and depression. This was before he ever played a game with the Steelers. And while Landesman encourages us to believe Webster killed himself, he actually died of a heart attack. Another basic fact involves Cyril Wecht, portrayed superbly by Albert Brooks. A keen-eyed observer may detect the JFK connection; Wecht has been a prominent assassination conspiracy theorist (Landesman's previous film ""Parkland"" is devoted to the assassination). Here we see Wecht being arrested and are left to assume that it's the NFL retaliating for Omalu's research. In fact Wecht was charged well BEFORE that research was published, or even known to the NFL.dCentral premise of the film: repeated concussions cause CTE. This is asserted throughout, with Omalu expansively blaming football for the players' deaths. The problem is that there is no scientific basis for this claim. According to the British Journal of Sports Medicine, ""there are no published epidemiological, crosssectional or prospective studies relating to modern CTE... Owing to the nature of the published studies, being case reports or pathological case series, it is not possible to determine the causality or risk factors with any certainty. As such, the speculation that repeated concussion or subconcussive impacts cause CTE remains unproven."" In short, the plural of anecdote is not data. Furthermore, there is ample evidence that NFL players live LONGER than average.I realize it's too much to ask a Hollywood picture to eschew emotional appeals, narratives and love stories, even when they do harm to the movie's impact. But this movie would have been so much better served by hewing to the truth."

Ridley Scott is a Producer on this picture and he has a very high track record of hits behind him as producer and director. He did not direct this one. This film follows the true story of Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian forensic neuropathologist working as as coroner in Pittsburgh who discovers brain damage from head injuries due to professional football. The story tracks Omalu's issues when this all comes to light and his battle with the NFL. Will Smith is once again fantastic in the role of Omalu and his Nigerian accent is bang on and never falters as many actors do when using an accent that is different from their own. Albert Brooks did a great job as Omalu's boss and brings his unique comic wit to the role.

It is certainly a very intriguing story, made all the while more enjoyable with a stellar group of actors who were very committed and clearly did their research for their roles. Will Smith is probably the most unlike himself he's ever been here, having completely transformed in to this Nigerian doctor. The ""truth"" moment is particularly powerful and showcased just how deep in to this part Smith immersed himself. I was very underwhelmed by the plot itself, it is quite a slow moving film as the entire situation is so straight forward that they were clearly trying to stretch out how little of a story they had as much as they could. As well as that, it has no proper conclusion. I understand that this is exactly what happened in real life, but I would have liked a bit more closure. It finishes raising more questions than it had answered. It is a film that can take you away solely on its performances. Well acted and directed, Concussion may leave you a little disappointed, but it is still worth the watch if you are looking for a good drama, just do not go out of your way to see it.

The premise of the film sees a pathologist find out the damage that concussion in American football really can cause. Will smith plays Dr Bennett omalu in this film and this is possibly his best ever performance, he totally washed away the will Smith I usually see and bought into this character that is so interesting and likable. He nailed the accent and I feel like he gave everything in the dramatic scenes hoping for that Oscar. Albert brooks plays his boss and I thought he was pretty awesome in this film, his chemistry with smith is really good and he definitely provides a lot of comic relief which does really work. Alec Baldwin plays a doctor more in line with the football side and he is also great in this film, he has great scenes with smith that can be really emotional. Gugu mbatha raw plays a girl who ends up having to live with omalu and she does a good job as they start to build a friendship based on there differences and I liked it. The story of the film is really interesting as you see omalu going through the investigation into the concussion law and a conflict he does have with the NFL. However the first bit of the film just isn't that interesting as you see all these things that don't involve concussion and I was waiting for this film to get going. The script has some great dramatic dialogue especially by smith who nails it in the role, also surprisingly when needed it has some really good humour in it as well. The style of the film has some really intense scenes in it that makes you care about the situation. But I feel like it would been better if the subject matter was more balanced instead of being totally against the NFL which this film does.

Will Smith does a great job as the doctor, as enjoyable as his performance in The Pursuit of Happiness.The actress who plays his wife is also excellent. When he wavers in facing the forces trying to silence him, she reminds him his name is Omalu Onyemalukwube: ""if you know, you must come forth and speak.""Supporting actors, including Alec Baldwin, do a good job as well. Highly recommended, and a topic that every parent should be aware of."
" Concussion Is Ahead Of The Game
",0.0,0.9857,2017-03-01 00:00:00,9,"Looked at this movie without having read any reviews or related articles. The synopsis alone read like it should be seen and thankfully it did not disappoint. This based-on-fact story of Nigerian born Dr Bennet Omalu, offers a truly riveting and rare modern movie experience.From the performances, direction, cinematography, right down to the music score this is Superior film making. It's a worthy film that outlines the threat of CTE on contact sport players. The high profile NRL tried to squash this information by arranging for its own independent follow-up 'investigations' - basically performed by high flying on-the-payroll 'Doctors and researchers' - to push Dr Omalu's case out of the headlines and away from public attention. As with the cigarette corporations, these death-for-profit merchants almost succeeded but for the continued efforts of a dedicated few and some 'thinking' players who eventually began to wake-up to their own serious conditions.Will Smith is just about the whole show - can't think of too many that could have brought such an understated honesty to this important role. Right down to rejecting a 'comfort' offer from the White House for a position of 'convenience'. If you have a passion for seeking truth and enjoy an entertainment with a little more intelligence, it could be right here waiting for you....."
" One of the better movies from Will Smith
",0.4404,0.9951,2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"I'm not the biggest fan of Will Smith but sometimes he has his moments and in Concussion he definitely has a good moment. It's one of his better movies that I saw. He plays his role as Dr. Bennet Omalu, the immigrant forensic neuropathologist that discovered CTE, a football related brain trauma, very well. The fact that the story is based on a true story makes it even better. And once again we see that the rich people that run the show, like the NFL, are just soulless greedy people only thinking about their interests regardless the health issues of others. It's another scandal like we saw before with the tobacco industry. To win against all those lobbies is almost impossible and you can only applaud people like Dr. Bennet Omalu for trying to make a difference. Not that in the end it will change very much because like you can see people are still smoking or playing American football. Of course everybody has the right to risk their life with things like that but it's just people should be warned what kind of bad things could happen to them. That they continue after the warnings is their business, as long as they don't start whining when it's too late. You were warned and it was up to you to make a good decision. Now as for the movie I thought the cast was really good, with excellent acting from almost the whole cast, with an excellent moving story that had to be told."
