" Beautiful movie
",0.5994,0.855,2021-04-08 00:00:00,8,"I loved this movie, the acting was really good and the story as well. The ending was a little sudden but still good."
" Great story
",0.6249,0.9654,2021-03-01 00:00:00,6,"It is a little bit Comedy a lot of drama and no Romance , but the story is really good.
-The question is was she good was she bad ? Yes it was wrong but ... ,
-Elliot Page was great and over all a good easy watching movie."
" Ignore the positive reviews, save your time.
",0.6486,0.1602,2021-01-24 00:00:00,1,"The literal entirety of this movie is a slow burner with the exception of one or two scenes. The most boring fusturating movie I've ever watched with even more boring/fusturating character. There's hardly anything comedic or heartfelt about this movie.
Just pure stupidity, awful plot and nothing to be learned.
Again save your time."
" Beautiful!
",0.636,0.3989,2020-12-08 00:00:00,9,Very well cast. This is right up my street. I needed a Tallulah in my life 20 years ago!
" 3 stars for the camerawork
",0.0,0.25,2020-11-27 00:00:00,3,"A drag of a movie about weak women, bad women, deranged women etc. if you are a woman that likes films about women like you then you will love this. i found it boring like a room full of valium addicts. the saving grace is i downloaded it illegally so i dont need to sue for a refund plus damages and costs.
nice cinematography though, just shame about the story and actors."
" It's brilliant... just not finished
",0.0,0.9265,2020-11-26 00:00:00,9,"Tallulah is a very compelling film and very heartwarming but I wish that the ending was more full-filling. The relationship between the characters was well built up and I loved the overall story. I just wished that we found out what happen to Tallulah and I think that the abusive mother surely shouldn't have been able to take Maddie back.Overall, definitely watch it and it's worth while. Just disappointed with its outcome."
" It's not a comedy nor an indie movie!
",-0.3404,0.9473,2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,"I really didn't expect anything from a movie by Netflix which is weirdly classified as comedy! However it was a great surprise for me to see this deep, touching and well written story from Sian Heder the versed in femininity writer, and perfect performances from all of the characters..
Especially Allison Janney who should've gotten an oscar nomination for this!
I think it's a very underrated movie that should get more attention and appreciation and that's why I reviewed it."
" Very good
",0.4927,0.9268,2020-09-02 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie on Netflix. I found it was very good story. Well written, great cast."
" Underrated Movie That You Should Definitely Watch
",0.4019,0.9737,2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,"I went into this movie assuming it was going to be dark, slow, and largely uneventful (I really only decided to watch it because of the cast and the good reviews). I couldn't have been more wrong, and I'm extremely glad I decided to give it a chance. The film perfectly combines comedy with drama- the comedic moments are woven in in ways that make you laugh but don't take away from the seriousness of the story. It's heartwarming, funny, sad, and sweet all at the same time. Would definitely recommend!"
" A beautiful coming of age story brought to life by a really good cast
",0.796,0.8847,2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,"Tallulah, or Lu as everybody calls her, lives in her truck with her boyfriend, Nico. Sick of her fear to commit to anything, he leaves her, so she decides to go look for him at his mothers house. In the process she comes across a toddler neglected by its alcoholic and careless mother and she ends up kidnapping the baby. She then pretends it's hers and Nico's baby and Nico's mother starts taking care of her. A bond is slowly created between the two women.It's a pretty good movie that I would recommend. you're left wondering during the entire movie how and if that Impossible situation is going to be solved. Even if the theme is pretty ""dramatic"" the actors, by giving a really good and convincing performance, give the characters something not pathetic, not illusional, but deeply human. At the beginning of the movie, the main character is not at all lovable. But the more you learn about her past, the more you understand her and her behavior. We learn to appreciate her the same way that the mother does.The metaphor of the gravity, that starts in the first scene of the movie till the end, to describe somebody's attachment to something is relatable and adds something to the story. The entire movie feels like a coming of age story where Lu needs to learn to stop running away and the mother to start holding on to something."
" From a guy's perspective, this movie is meaningful and absolutely amazing!!!
",0.8057,-0.8049,2020-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I do not understand the low ratings and the complaints about the ending. This movie is not supposed to give you a conclusion to what happens to the baby and the individuals. It's about 3 main characters, who are troubled in their own ways. You kind of hate the mom, who neglects her baby, and you see a divorced woman, who has given up on life, not daring to take a step forward and move on from her failed marriage, and a girl who can't find peace within, and needs to live a life of constant escape, while burning bridges behind her.When you get to learn the characters individually and their reasons for living and behave the way they do, you sympathise with each one of them in their own way.The ending that bothers some people:
At one point Lu tells Margo in the park, to imagine if gravity disappeared under them, and Margo says she would let go, while Lu would hold on to a branch of a tree.The ending everyone settles in their own way, the mother finally shows love for her missing baby, Lu stops escaping and faces her fears and realities of life. Margo goes the the same spot in the park, and floats of the group, and tries to hold on to a branch, which is the interpretation of holding on to life after all. 3 troubled characters who clash together and help each other for a better tomorrow. It doesn't need to end any other way. The ending was perfect. The kidnapping of the child shouldn't be the main focus but the troubled characters who are finally set free mentally.Beautiful story!!"
" Underrated gem of modern cinema
",0.0,0.9654,2020-04-16 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful. Well written, great acting, the cast has so much chemistry you never want the scenes between Margo and Lu to end, the plot is very interesting and keeps you at the edge of your chair. I really don't understand why it didn't get more attention from festivals and alike. A true gem. Truly moving."
" Enjoyable Movie With Scrambled Egg Storyline - Ellen Page = Excellent
",0.765,0.4404,2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"03/30/2020 Tallulah aka Ellen Page leads an imaginary, fantasy driven life that accidentally brings her in contact with a young female infant. The story unfolds from there. Nothing earth shattering happens, just a well rounded emotionally driven movie for viewers to enjoy. Bon Appetit'"
" Such a TERRIBLE ending!!
",-0.6616,-0.6577,2020-03-14 00:00:00,2,Was quite enjoying this till the end!! One of THE worst most silly pointless endings I've ever seen to a film!! Wasted my time watching this ðŸ˜©
" Ellen Page rocks
",0.0,0.9758,2020-03-05 00:00:00,9,"I've always been a fan of Ellen Page, seen most of her films, but this one I liked the most. She nails the role of a lost drifter turned child protective services perfectly. The movie held my interest throughout, everybody in it did an excellent job and I would have given it a 10 except for the ending. They had a perfect ending with Page looking out the car window and then added the last thing which didn't really make any sense."
" In a word: Yawn.
",0.0,-0.8979,2020-02-23 00:00:00,3,"Predictable sentimental crap. Yawn, then watch on fast forward. Nothing happens. Read some PC nonsense for 35 seconds then imagine it stretched into a feature film in which you can predict every scene. Finishes with some contrived teary-eyed stuff and then a melancholy acceptance... Badly blah blah. Then watch something worthwhile to forget the crap you just sat through."
" Very very boring
",-0.4351,-0.7334,2020-02-15 00:00:00,3,"This film is very overrated. Poor acting, cringe and predictable storyline. What a waste of 2 hours."
" Heart wrenching
",0.0,0.9805,2019-12-03 00:00:00,10,"Hubby and I stumbled across this movie in the wee hours of the morning while our daughter whos around the same age as madison couldnt get to sleep.
Ive never held my daughter so tightly while watching a movie. This movie hit me in the heart and soul. I just wanted to reach into the tv and bring madison home forever and keep her safe, loved and cherished. Not many movies have EVER moved me like this and this is why Im giving it 10/10.
The characters are beautifully written and the story flows so perfectly. The end did come abruptly but it ended it perfectly. The reviews saying the ending was rubbish missed a very big part of the underlining story.
I laughed and I balled my eyes out, maybe its just my mum side that made it resonate with me ... all i wanted to do the whole time was protect that baby!!"
" LOVED it BUT one thing I would CHANGE
",0.4246,0.9957,2019-04-06 00:00:00,9,"Ok, I've NEVER written a review before but for some weird reason I've decided too about this movie.
FIRST I LOVED IT!!
I loved the actors/actresses in it, I thought the acting was amazing, I was hard to take my eyes off of the screen. The story is NOT just for women I think some men would like it too
BUT WARNING SPOILERS DO NOT READ BECAUSE IM GOING TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE ENDINGNormally I really like when some endings of a movie leave you kinda guessing or left you to interpret it how you would like BUT NOT THIS ONE!
When I looked and there was only a few minutes left I totally knew they were not going to show you a ""closure ending""& I personally was SO MAD & DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
I wanted too see the Bad Mom day your right I don't want her, I love her but I can't take care of her, so then they would ""decide together"" a way too help the child & the mom by letting her be adopted by that gay couple who were looking to adopt!!! So no charges would be laid, the kid is settled, the girl is now living with the lady, who is DATING the doorman now!!! Who has contact with her son now,& has released the past & everyone is happy. Bec honesty every person watching that thought 100% that the gay couple would adopt that baby. That would all work out that you way, we just wanted to see it!!!!!!!!!!i wanted to feel all happy inside when I watched it play out lol
Okay well it didn't play that way really but because we are left to interpret it the way we want, so I guess it did then!!!
But In all honesty I loved this movie so much, amazing acting & honesty a wonderful story"
" Loved this!
",0.636,0.9741,2019-03-23 00:00:00,8,This film is the reason I love movies! Beautifully written and superb actors bringing interesting characters to life. Ellen Page excels in this probably her best role to date.
" So bad you can't look away.
",-0.5849,-0.8971,2019-02-18 00:00:00,2,"Sorry, the reviews praising this must be... um...planted. This movie is a very amateur effort at filmmaking even with some star quality actors like Ellen Page and Allison Janney. Sadly, Ellen Page, over acts throughout the entire film and looks like hell the entire time. Sorry, even if playing homeless skinny hungry girl you can at least make her look a bit appealing or like her hair was washed at some point when living with others. EVERYONE in this film is SO unattractive it's a little startling. Allison Janney is too understated trapped in a mess of a cast with nowhere to go. The plot is predictable and with caricature of characters. The mother that loses the child IS SO over the top in acting in the beginning.... it's almost satire. Nothing about this is appealing nor worth the time. Sadly. Believe the bad reviews. I wish I had."
" Shame..
",0.0,0.6849,2019-02-08 00:00:00,10,Good film..it could happen. . but not a good ending... Such a shame.. would love to have seen what happened to T.
" Garbage Film
",0.0,-0.7705,2019-01-13 00:00:00,2,"Awful movie.So the child is taken away from the neglectful mother by a young girl with little experience an good intentions... then in the end the child is returned to the neglectful mother even though she has not had to change at all? Basically by the end of the movie the neglectful bad mother is still a bad mother but the child is given back to her? This is very stupid. At least the movie could have ended in a way that let us know the child would be protected or taken care of, or sent to a better place. This movie was trash. It basically says that even if someone is a terrible parent they have the right to keep on pretending to be a parent? This terrible mom did not even put clothes on her kid... the kid was running around naked before the young girl took her away from the mom and put clothes on her.
Tell me why the neglectful mom did not go to jail too? If the movie had ended with her in handcuffs it would have been a better movie. Truly disgusted by this film. Pray for anyone who thinks this ended well for the child."
" Excellent
",0.5719,0.9442,2018-12-03 00:00:00,10,Superb. Allison is always a pleasure to watch. Her dynamic with Ellen is just great. Solid story.
" This was nice, I enjoyed it!
",0.75,0.9797,2018-11-25 00:00:00,9,"I liked this, it was different. I enjoyed the acting. The story line had some good twist and turns in it. I was hoping for a good ending and everyone is ok. I wanted someone to look out for this child. It is good, the acting is. This is a touching kind of film and I would have to say a today kind of film. I myself know of this kind of scene when it comes to the innocents of a child. This was good and I like it. I saw her name Ellen Page and said let me take a look. I'm not mad at this film."
" This was really sweet
",0.5095,0.7316,2018-09-14 00:00:00,10,"Really fun and cool and different screenplay , the thespians and everything worked out really well..."
" A Good Movie in Search of an Ending
",0.4404,0.9588,2018-09-09 00:00:00,8,"Tallulah has a dynamite cast and is engaging throughout. That is, until the ending.Ellen Page is great as the title character and often displays the wry, endearing humor that made Juno such a memorable film. Seeing her and Allison Janney together is a real treat. Both women are wonderful actors who exhibit powerful chemistry together.The premise is interesting, too. Is Tallulah justified in taking a baby from a drunken, unwilling mom? Perhaps. Although it's still kidnapping.Then comes the ending. I was very disappointed that so many questions went unanswered. It's like they ran out of time, just stopped filming and ran the credits. Who got the baby? What happened to Tallulah? Did she stay with Nico? The sloppy ending left me feeling unsatisfied and, frankly, cheated."
" A film as genuine as the todlers cry
",-0.4767,-0.263,2018-09-03 00:00:00,10,"When one of the main parts of a film is a little girl nearing her second birthday, the bar is set for something that transcends the highest standards of writing or acting. That child is feeling what she feels, whether comfort or fear. The child who is thrust into a world she never chose, something that sets the standard of every line, every interaction, every emotion, of every single character of Tallulah.This was a film where there were no bad guys, something that is rare as the contrast between good and evil is an almost ubiquitous element of theater in all its forms. The drama of life is more subtle than that, as it is really the cosmic tragedy of individuals trying to find their place in a world beyond their understanding. It's being born to a mother who finds her infant child a burden, that she shudders at living with for the rest of her life.  I'm aware of the vast talent and skill that must be applied to make a wonderful movie experience all seem effortless. It worked! The two hours of being transported to this fictional world was as real at that child at Costco who thought she recognized me a few hours earlier, as I was like another person who felt the joy of innocent connection. One of the most absorbing, genuine and memorable films I've ever experienced."
" wonderful movie
",0.5719,0.764,2018-08-26 00:00:00,9,I really loved this movie it showed real time things but at the end I really wish they said what happened specifically to Tallulah.
" Good movie
",0.4404,0.1901,2018-07-10 00:00:00,9,I was a liile skeptical because of the low score. But I thought: a movie with Ellen Page and Alisson Janney can't be that bad...And it wasn't. The two actresses (and the rest of the cast) make this one captivating movie to watch.The story is a simple one. But you sure get involved by the characters.I won't say much more so I do not spoil anything.
" Brilliant acting and a solid script
",0.6597,0.9745,2018-01-06 00:00:00,9,"It's amazing how some movies have the power to tell complex stories through simple and predictable scripts. The complexity of this brand of storytelling lies in the depth of the central characters, each of whom have a beautiful journey of their own. Characters are not branded as heroes and anti-heroes, but just people. The film touches upon very basic human emotions in an honest way and leaves you feeling empathetic to each of the central characters, despite all their flaws. 
Page and Janney are incredible in their respective roles. They get into the skin of the characters and add their own personalities to them, which is quite rare. Hope their work receives some recognition in the awards season."
" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.8427,2017-07-04 00:00:00,1,"What a flaming pile of crap? The people who are rating this movie highly are crazy. I couldn't get through it because it's so boring. The actors are ugly, and playing characters that are trailer trash with no redeeming qualities whatsoever! I use this site to determine what might be a good bet on Netflix. In this case, that plan failed miserably. There is no way one could say this movie is awesome; no way. Do the rest of us a favor and submit honest reviews."
