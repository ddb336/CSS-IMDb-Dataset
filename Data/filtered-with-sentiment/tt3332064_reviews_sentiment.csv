" Don't believe the negativity
",0.4023,0.8704,2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,I really liked this movie. Great special effects. The actors were well cast. I understand the controversy around Tiger lily casting but does a movie need to be vilified for this reason. Give it a chance it's worth it.

" Peter pan

The pirates and blackbeard sing nirvana, you can tell what you are into from thatMost of the movie is in a dull mine with wierd acting like the actor who plays james hook.References to the old original animated movie ""peter pan"" and shoving it in your face, and a setup for sequel ending"
" Could have been much better
",0.4404,0.2582,2021-01-29 00:00:00,5,The movie has good cast with great animation. But a very very poor script. At some point you feel it would go great and then right next it disappoints you!
" Truly awful, a nightmare
",-0.0258,-0.9129,2021-01-03 00:00:00,2,"Pan is a terrible film, Levi Miller is annoying as Peter Pan, there's an unfortunate lack of wit and comedy in the film and it's played more straight.Acting wise it's pretty dull but not a complete failure, Hugh Jackman is rather good as the main villain and even though the material he's given is poor he manages to make the most of it. The story is terrible however, and deserves very little credit, and the overuse of CGI just makes it even worse. The CGI is good but replaces any form of practical effects and stunts making it a bad addition, and there's no suspense to any of the fight scenes.2/10: Very poor, hopefully Disney's remake will be better"
" Horrendous accents and wooden acting
",-0.5859,-0.8268,2021-01-01 00:00:00,2,"Interesting premise as a story ruined by some very dodgy and movable accents. Peter fluctuates been Dick Van Dyke cockney and posh school with every other line. I still haven't figured out where or what Hook is supposed to be or where from.
A waste of 2 hours."
" Largely wasted potential
",-0.4939,-0.9242,2020-12-21 00:00:00,5,"You know what the sad thing about this movie is? It actually had a lot of great potential. This had ALL the right ideas to make a great Peter Pan prequel, but too bad it was wasted to become just...forgettable.Pan is a largely mixed bag that is ultimately let down by the task of telling an origin story that it unfortunately failed at very badly. Sure, the movie does have positives like some decent-looking visual effects, mildly okay action scenes, and performances by the main actors that did try to put in some effort, but this is mostly hindered by poor writing that delivered an embarrassingly predictable story, a terrible execution that leaves several questions unanswered, an unbearable overuse of CGI, and a cast of blatant and banal characters.The only recommendation I'd give is really for die-hard Peter Pan fans, since they're gonna have the best time with this movie and eat it up like it's nothing. Otherwise, if you do decide to see it, set your expectations rather low. This definitely isn't a bad movie, but I'm not too happy with Peter about this because even I know he can do better than this."
" Magic adventure with plenty of fantasy , amusement and overwhelming special effects
",0.7579,0.9948,2020-10-20 00:00:00,6,"A very free adaptation based on Sir James M. Barrie play taking the characters and some amusing situations in brilliant frames.

Adding enjoyable relationships as Peter meets Tiger Lily : Rooney Mara and an adventurer : Garrett Hedlund called Hook . Along the way Pan fights enemies and attempts to save his friends from scheming pirate and his hoodlums , being shown on charming and breathtaking images filled with noisy action and big fun . It turns out to be a haunting , colorful and delightful film , though unfortunately failed at box office in spite of its big budget , that's why it has some failures , gaps and it changes excessively the ordinary Peter Pan's canon . The film displays a glimmering and shimmering cinematography by John Mathieson and Seamus MacGarvey . As well as a moving and thrilling musical score by Marco Beltrani.

" Pro tip: Fast forward to Jackman's scenes
",0.0,-0.5927,2020-09-15 00:00:00,3,"The casting for Pocahontas is laugh out loud funny when you first see it. But ignoring that fact, the film still falls flat. The villain is the only watchable thing about the movie. Somehow they even make all the special effects muted. Strange film choices."
" Why the hate
",-0.5719,0.9336,2020-08-27 00:00:00,10,I actually like pan and the way it tells us a different story from the original is a ctually really good the way it was potrayed at was executed nicely and i just love the soundtracks

" Glad I didn't listen to the poor reviews on this one
",-0.0258,0.9767,2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was really good. I don't know what all the negative reviews were about. Levi Miller was charming as Peter Pan. Hugh Jackman was great as Blackbeard. One of the best origin story movies I have seen. I don't think I would have liked paying to see it in the movie theatre, but it was well worth the $2.99 I paid to rent it on amazon prime. If you have kids and haven't seen it, watch it now! Great fun for the whole family."
" Good movie but confusing
",-0.1027,0.8999,2020-07-23 00:00:00,7,"I liked it but it was a little bit confusing to me I mean is it related to the original Peter Pan movie or they just used the same names?
Overall not bad you would enjoy it"
" A total mess, but an interesting mess
",-0.1154,-0.9426,2020-07-14 00:00:00,2,"Can we all just agree that not everything needs an origin story? Or, at the very least, not every origin story needs to be a film. Pan is the prequel that attempts to tell the tale of how Peter Pan became the character we all know and some of us love (personally I'm mildly indifferent towards him as a character.) I can't put a ton of fault on the cast in this film. Most of them were given very little quality material to work with, and did the best they could. Even Hugh Jackman and Garrett Hedlund, who are over-the-top and awful in the film, felt like they were forced into it by the roles they were meant to play. I actually found Adeel Akhtar quite fun to watch as Smee, and Levi Miller is a solid child actor to take the lead role in the film, which can sometimes be difficult to find.I had 2 major takeaways from my experience of watching Pan. First and foremost is that the creators must be massive fans of Steven Spielberg's Hook. This movie is playing off of things that were created for that film in multiple ways. The colorful visuals were reminiscent of that film, and even Blackbeard's personality and appearance reminded me of Dustin Hoffman's Captain Hook. The other big takeaway is that the writer and director might have been fans of Steven Spielberg's work with the character of Peter Pan, but they don't really understand him at all. Yes, this movie is loaded with winking references to things we will remember from the stories, but it puts a completely different spin on the main character. Let me explain...The number one quality that defines Peter Pan is that he's immature and never wants to grow up. He's not necessarily a heroic figure for these reasons, and good movies about him explore why remaining a child forever might not be the best thing. However, in Pan it's actually Blackbeard that is gleefully using people in order to maintain his youth. It's a prequel where Peter is actually fighting against someone for doing exactly what will one day define his character. Also, instead of being the magic that makes people fly, pixie dust is the drug that allows youthfulness. It's not a natural trait of Neverland that people don't grow old, they need the fairy dust drugs to pull that off. Oh yeah, and only Pan can fly in this story.I can handle some retconning of a character, but it feels like they broke a lot of the things that make Neverland and Peter Pan what they are in the first place. Also, Pan is a complete mess tonally. It starts feeling somewhat serious and grim. Peter is trapped in the same orphanage where Oliver Twist grew up, that is run by evil nuns. We see them in war-torn London, hoping they won't be killed in the next German bombing. Then the next thing you know a flying pirate ship arrives, and we are instantly transported into the strangest fantasy land, where you can play with other planets as if they were the size of a toy. Then things get grim again as we enter the equivalent of a dangerous coal mine, and not long after that the characters are on the run from giant CGI birds.Perhaps the most specific way I can address this dichotomy of tone is the fact that we see characters murdered in the film by being shot in the head. Yes, on-camera deaths happen. But they manage to keep their PG rating because, instead of showing blood and guts, the dead disappear into a puff of colorful smoke like the character just finished a Color Run. This is the kind of nonsense that Pan has to offer. That's not even mentioning the strange anachronistic music that they include in the film. There is a brief time where it felt like they were trying to make this a musical, including a sea-shanty version of Smells Like Teen Spirit. It was so ridiculous, I don't even know what to say about it. As you can see, while Pan is a terrible movie, it is kind of fascinating the level of disaster they created here. I certainly could never call it boring, and I could see some young kids forming nostalgia for this one in the same way they did for Hook, and elevating its reputation beyond what it deserves."
" Fun blockbuster
",0.802,0.8917,2020-07-05 00:00:00,9,"It's worth seeing Pan for all the stunning visuals. The lead is very engaging, and antagonist Hugh Jackman was an inspired choice. This one is easy to recommend."
" What were they thinking!
",0.0,0.2707,2020-06-30 00:00:00,5,"They could have made something magical.
Open a new generation to the world of Peter Pan and Captain Hook.But instead we got a over effect ""What on Earth were they thinking""Could have been so much better but what a dispointment."
" All great stories have a beginning
",0.6249,0.9833,2020-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Weird, fun watch, could watch again, and a do recommend, especially for ""Peter Pan"" fans.While I can't argue that this is canonical to anything you've seen through Disney, this is a really fun twist on the origin story of Peter Pan, which always seemed so shrouded in mystery.The approach of a resource shortage in this imagination land, by invaders no less, seems quite clever to me, and possibly a jab at the English for all the colonization they've done.While this is definitely the most insane role Hugh Jackman has ever done, he did marvelously, and all of the core characters nailed their parts. While Levi Miller comes off possibly inexperienced, he was definitely able to hold his own next to Garrett Hedlund and Rooney Mara, and though she was certainly skillful, it was odd to see her as Princess Tiger Lily (as the origin of the character is traditionally Native American (and I'm still not sure why that was ever the case), but they did manage to vary the tribe).I will have to say Nonso Anozie was my favorite here, he has a lovely, ""I'm just doing my job."" attitude, and Adeel Akhtar plays a delightfully mad Smee.Other than the Fey, there is plenty of what you would expect, even if there is more of one than the other until the movie actually begins to ""Peter Pan"", and the movie finds a wonderful balance between whimsy and sincerity.Well worth a try if you ever liked any story of ""Peter Pan""."
" It a okay film but not true to the source material.
",-0.3711,0.9604,2020-06-12 00:00:00,4,"It's a okay adventure but doesn't stay true to the source material, Jason Fuchs butchers the original story of Peter pan. The setting of Peter pan was original Victorian England, whereas pan is set around the time of world war 2. Captain Hook Peters greatest enemy an English Pirate that had ""good form"". But in this interpretation of Hook is a American cowboy very far from the original book. In the film titled ""Hook"" they showed a different origin story for how Peter was saved by tinkerbell and took Peter to neverland to learn to fly. Which made a better beginning to the Peter pan origin, than how pan was conceived and who was his parents.But if you are looking for a film about pirates vs fairy's with singing and adventure this is a okay watch."
" Evil styled ""wows"" and nothing else.
",-0.6597,-0.9786,2020-05-27 00:00:00,1,"The tone the whole way through is panicky-angry. No other tone exists in the film. Someone is always running, upset, scared, desperate, and only evil people exist as a back stop (and a front stop) as if that's some kind of solace.No fairies, instead there's fish/locust swarms. Bubbles of predatory fish/amphibians. No character from Hugh Jackmans villain, just being a showman. No character from the main child playing Pan, just acting tough or scared. No one to follow through the film."
" Pan is... So Strange I Couldn't Even Finish It.
",-0.2716,0.8274,2020-05-15 00:00:00,1,"To start, I usually finish a movie, even if it's bad. I will not judge a film without seeing it through and cultivating my opinion of it all... but 'Pan' is another story.It is nonsensical, goofy, and poorly edited. In the first 3-5 minutes I was concerned that the 'Food, Glorious Food' song from 'Oliver!' would kick in. Then, from nowhere, flying pirates appear and are accepted by the characters without question.I usually avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I must mention one more scene. After the boys are taken to Neverland (again, without question!), everyone - including Hugh Jackman, as Blackbeard - sings 'Smells Like Teen Spirit.' I swear, I'm not making that up. They just.. sing it. In Neverland. In the 1940's.So, how would this work? Was the song actually written by Blackbeard, and was later stolen by the members of Nirvana, who used to be Lost Boys? Did Blackbeard time travel to the 1990's and become obsessed with grunge rock, taking the culture back with him? Who knows.I'd have a long wrap up, but I think my point is clear: stay away from 'Pan.'"
" That was a spectacular...
",0.0,-0.5423,2020-05-13 00:00:00,1,Spectacularly bad film. The only thing that remotely tied it to Peter Pan was the use of a few of the names. I feel I was robbed of 90 minutes of my life.
" Well worth seeing
",0.4588,0.9656,2020-05-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie is in no way bad,, matter of fact it's pretty good for the most part (especially considering its supposed to be a prequel to the Peter Pan story we're used to).There were definitely a few things that I thought were weird,, like the singing when the boat arrives in Neverland with the orphans (i liked it,, just wasn't expecting it). Also, while I've been impressed with most of his work, I thought Hedland's acting was a bit over the top,, definitely enjoyed Mara as Tiger Lily,,,Anyways,, go watch it!"
" Pan
",0.0,-0.9245,2020-05-02 00:00:00,3,"The lead had no personality, all other characters were stereotypes, the story was cliche as sin, and the ending was awful. They never explain how Pan and Hook became enemies, they just threw in some dumb joke about it!"
" Terrible storyline.
",-0.4767,-0.3699,2020-04-26 00:00:00,3,"There is a bit of comedy in but the storyline is lousy. If you're for sticking to the original story, then you will not enjoy this movie. I'm all for sticking to the original story and not change anything."
" Okay movie some bad actors
",-0.3818,-0.3071,2020-04-24 00:00:00,4,The only reason I rated this is because the guy that played hook was the worst actor I've ever witnessed. He single-handedly ruined the film. I like everything else except for his parts. Terrible acting he did good in the movie tron. But whoever casted him on this needs to walk the plank.
" Uugghh
",0.0,0.9832,2020-04-06 00:00:00,6,"Hugh Jackman stars as Blackbeard in this classic retelling of Peter Pan with a rather large twist. After seeing a baby being abandoned we move forward twelve years to London during World War Two. Peter (Miller) and his partner in crime live their lives under the strict rule of the head sister at an orphanage. They believe something is not right at the orphanage and sure enough, one night time pirates arrive and steal all the children.While this is going on London is also being bombed, and the ensuing battle scene as the flying pirate ship escapes is pretty impressively done. The children are taken to Neverland though and once there Peter meets and an old and familiar enemy. With his help they manage to escape from Blackbeard's clutches and into the hands of a local tribe, who believe that Peter is the subject of a long known prophecy of a boy who can fly, uniting the tribes as one.All sounds good fun so far right? Well there is a lot to like in Pan but unfortunately there is also a lot to dislike too. The acting for the most part is reasonable and Miller as Peter is pretty well cast. Unfortunately his story gets somewhat lost amongst everything else that is happening. Mara is excellent but ultimately is relegated to an attractive warrior princess role. Jackman (who is most likely the big draw here) over-acts superbly but a poor script lets him and the others down.I came into this film without knowing too much and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Pan is an enjoyable fantasy ride with a wonderful score, but some bad CGI (in contrast to some of the wonderful effects also on show), a muddled and convoluted story, along with a poor script really hurt the film. There are also some very pointless things included and some things (Blackbeard's quest for just one example) which are just nonsensical to say the least.And this did ultimately show upon its release. As a film in its own right it could have been much much better, but as a family fun film for a Sunday afternoon to keep the young kids amused, then I imagine that it adequately caters to its target audience. The film looks lavish, has plenty of excitement for the little ones but don't expect anything too special from it.
The Sage's Rating: 6/10"
" Stick with Disney
",0.0,0.9561,2020-03-30 00:00:00,1,"I thought this movie was going to be pretty decent. I couldn't understand why all the critics ""Pan""ned this movie. (Sorry). Now I know why. It's lazy. It takes place during World War II, yet during the first scene in Neverland the pirates are singing 1970's hits like ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" Not only that, but it took any magic the original had and gave an explanation for it. In this one, pixie dust is mined. That's basically the equivalent of ""Phantom Menace"" using midichlorians to explain the Force. The CGI on the various creatures in Neverland looks like it came from the early '90's and is overall just lazy. Also, Peter is half-human/half-fairy, which was just stupid and again, takes away the magic of the original. They also made Hook (who is not the villain in this by the way. It's Blackbeard, played brilliantly by Hugh Jackman, but I'll get to that later) into a wannabe Han Solo. And the overall plot is a blatant ripoff of Harry Potter: Chosen One who is an orphan is whisked away to another world where he learns his parents were killed by the villain. The villain's main goal is immortality. They even put in the ""You have your mother's eyes"" line from Harry Potter. If J.K. Rowling doesn't sue, I'll be very surprised. The only good part of this movie was Hugh Jackman as the villain Blackbeard. He pulls it off terrifically! He's terrifying. They should just make a Blackbeard movie with Hugh Jackman as the star. If you want to watch a Peter Pan movie, please stick with the Disney version. There's nothing magical about this one.Grade: D+ 3/10 1/5 stars."
" This is NOT the peter pan u know!
",0.0,0.9855,2019-12-28 00:00:00,9,"An absolute wonder of a film and very well done. I have a few things need to point out: this is not Peter Pan, it is also not Finding Neverland. I grew up watching and loving Hook with robin williams so for me, this film was a really well done piece. As for the parts people complain about, (nirvanas smells like teen spirit and blitzkrieg bop, tiger lily not being native american and the movie being shallow) they expect too much and didnt pay enough attention. For me, this film was beautifully well done, engaging and exciting. IMO this movie most closely resembles a prequel not to the original peter pan but to Hook. Hugh jackman plays one hell of a good bad guy and seems to be monstrously in love with his role.I pay alot of attention to details in films so Lets count the ways it appears to coincide with Hook:1. black beard mentions ""bad form"" twice. Once to hook and once to Peter. Iconic.2. The white crocodile is seen very early on in the film(the one who is in the square in Hook) in a floating water bubble.3. The tick tock tick tock reference appears where hook blows a hole in the wall and saves peter.4. Smee shows up in the mines and they did a PERFECT job of finding a man who looks like a young smee. He also refers to himself in the third person a few times which is very much smee. Much props to the actor.5. They do refer to peter as a ""lost boy"" at one point which foreshadows the boys in neverland set up and is great.6. The sword that blackbeard hands peter is nearly perfectly identical to the one he uses in hook. (it does get broken later but still)7. ""think a happy thought"" says black beard, right before peter flies for the first time.8. The croc is mentioned at one point when hook has his hand in the water playing and he yanks it back reeeeeal fast. Good stuff.9. Last but not least, peter and hook are friends and it shows thru in how they would be so very very familiar with each other in the film Hook. In Hook, captain hook is rather old. At least 55. In Pan, hook is maybe.... 25 or so. So the whole hook and peter thing where he is young works well IMO.
10. Hooks ship is called the jolly roger. This appears at the end.Things people dislike and fail to understand/notice:1. Smells like teen spirit and Blitzkrieg Bop:
Early early on, blackbeard mentions that the people singing are from every creed, nation, and ERA. Meaning, 2000s, 1900s, 1400s, etc. So blackbeard must also be. Why would he be a pirate then in such a backwards technological era then?2. Pixum. This is why. Blackbeard mentions a dream of death with eloquence. an ending for us all as he says. Then... You get to see him as a wrinkled old man using the pixum to stave off death and old age. Brilliant IMO.3. Why is he old if people dont age in neverland? Big mistake people make here, ONLY children who come to neverland dont age here. Not adults, not adolescents and not kids born there. Thats the rules for neverland but people forget. Thus the whole blackbeard seeking immortality thing fits perfectly.4. Tiger lilly is white not native. Easy there cowboy. The chief is black, the best warrior is asian, tiger lilly is white, the whole damn tribe is a melting pot of people and the chief even mentions how they are all one people regardless of race. Nuff said.5. Contrived plot, see thru story. Well, what did you expect? Its a bloody prequel! Of course its gonna be mostly transparent. But for all that, they did a great job with the film.6. Flying pirate ships in WW2, oliver twist references, and nasty nuns. I liked the crazy magical appeal of the space flight and the flying ships, as well as the fantastical airplane/ pirate ship battle, but if anything, this could be a -1 point flaw in some viewers eyes. Plus, that fat, food hogging mother nun had it coming. She was nasty nasty nasty.All things considered, the film was epic and well acted. Its not a masterpiece but i did wanna watch it again right after, which is rare for me. Some people just want movies to be what they want and they arent able to see them for how good they really are when they dont conform to the roles they expect. So if you wanted to see a great sequel to Hook, this is it. If you wanted an ultra original, deep and in depth story of peter pan and where he came from.... Take a hike mate. Sorry, thats just how it is."
" Everything Pan
",0.0,0.9517,2019-11-30 00:00:00,5,I've loved everything Pan since I first saw Mary Martin fly across the tv screen in 1960. I love everything Hugh Jackman. But.... this movie was hard to love. Not for children for sure. It was a nice few hours of diversion on a cold weekend.
" Pan (2015)
",0.0,0.942,2019-11-26 00:00:00,3,"Directed by Joe Wright. Starring Garrett Hedlund, Levi Miller, Hugh Jackman, Rooney Mara, Adeel Akhtar, Nonso Anozie, Lewis MacDougall, Kathy Burke, Jack Charles, Amanda Seyfried. (PG)Hectic, woefully-misguided interpretation/preamble of J.M. Barrie's beloved fantasy character, Peter Pan; a bombastic enterprise less likely to inspire joyful excitement than nauseous headaches. Starts out okay, set in a Dickensian orphanage during the Blitz, then fifteen minutes pass, the pirates show up, and it all goes to pot. Virtually none of the characters here, including our apprehensive, heartsick protagonist (Miller), resemble their original incarnations, and the massive, CGI-smothered production drains away all the fun and innocence one comes to expect from the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up; so cluttered and misshapenly fantastical, in fact, that it makes Steven Spielberg's overblown misfire, ""Hook,"" seem like a model of restraint! Among the film's many, many bizarre choices (Hedlund's Captain Hook resembling Indiana Jones??), arguably the most inexplicable is to have crowds chant the lyrics to contemporary rock songs like ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" Not quite the worst ""origin story"" of its year (Josh Trank's ""Fantastic Four"" reboot came out a couple months earlier), but the fact that it's a close call should speak depressing volumes.29/100"
" Okay
",0.2263,0.997,2019-11-16 00:00:00,8,"I borrowed this expecting it to be like the old animated movie I saw as a child, but was surprised to see that it was an origin story about how Peter Pan became Peter Pan. At first, I didn't know what to make of it, but in the end I enjoyed it. The CGI was great. It's one of those heavy CGI movies, which is okay (in this movie at least), though not everyone will like that. It's not meant to be taken seriously - just a fun fantasy - though sometimes I found it pushing the limits of unbelievability. And that's not because I lack a child's imagination - I have it in bucket loads as I am an author. While I don't mind something unrealistic in movies, sometimes it can go to far. But, maybe I'm just being picky.
The acting was fine - particularly on Levi Miller's and Hugh Jackman's parts - but nothing too memorable. I found some of the fight scenes - particularly between Jackman and Rooney Mara during the climax - not quite as epic as I was expecting.
It has the typical person-sucked-into-another-world-being-some-chosen-one message, though Peter's struggle to live up to his parents legacy is handled quite nicely. It has good messages about being yourself and doing what's right and have confidence in your own abilities. Though, I honestly didn't like the thing during the climax of Peter stretching out his arm and fairies shooting forth as it struck me as too comic-bookish superhero type of thing.
I liked some of the songs in it and the music score. It has some great humour and good emotions - some of which made me tear up.
Overall, it's a good movie, though there are some stupid parts in it. It's not for young kids, more for older kids.
There is one thing in it that I don't quite understand - why did James Hook decided to sacrifice himself? It wasn't like it was going to save someone else. Though, it did help Peter to stop doubting himself and accept his abilities. Still, apart from that, there didn't seem to be much point to it.
Iffy choice."

In spite of magnificent images with high technology, only flying actions were so wire-fu totally. I know he could fly depend on the fairy force. But there must be the gravity principle and the better way to fly like following physical laws!I felt the angles of arms were unatural with that flying speed. Maybe he got his arms broken!
I thought those were key points of this movies because 'the flying kid' was important element though. Or rather, those were totally on purpose maybe ( just unthinking )."

",0.0,0.9978,2019-04-06 00:00:00,10,"No spoilers here so you can read this without judgment. I am a young-ish woman who refuses to grow up and refuses to grow old. This film needs to be seen through the eyes of a child-like state, not picked to shreds because you are comparing it to other Peter Pan films. Yes, this film is more for adults than children. Yes it is different and yes I feel the reviews are far too harsh!Put on your imagination cap and go into watching this film with an open heart and open mind. It's NOT a children's movie. This is an older kid's movie remade for adults to remind us that we have an imagination and though the bad reviewers have their imagination shoved WAAAAAAAY up their behinds, they still have one, just need to learn how to pull it out of their bum's and USE IT!!!This film (if you watch with an open mind) will teach you that even the elderly never need to grow up. It forces thought and day-dreams urging the viewer to utilise them in day to day life. Children are not judgmental, racist, cruel or bullies by nature. It is us who TEACH them to be that way. Watching this film through the childlike state of an unspoiled, wide eyed one who is nurtured rather than picked on will show you how beautiful our imaginations can be if we just learned to use them.This film is visually stunning and if you were lucky enough to view it in 3D, has some amazing effects. Even without the large screen and special effects, my adult friends enjoyed this perfectly. I must admit I enjoyed and understood it better after watching it twice and have since revisited it over the years quite often.I am terminally ill and disabled and have been for about 3 years. This film has inspired me to daydream, smile more often, imagine the impossible and generally feel good. I genuinely feel from the pit of my being that people should enjoy this film. Learn to fly, cast a spell, believe in fairies, travel to far off lands, explore and have fun. Life is too short to miss out and our day to day lives too stressful to fully enjoy. Open your heart and engage with your inner child. It's sumple if you allow it to be...I realise I haven't spoken about the actors. I would rather focus on the importance of nurturing and feeling our inner children but I will say though I wasn't a huge fan (though I liked him well enough) Hugh Jackman completely impressed me. I didn't know it was him until I was told. He looks totally different.To sum it all up, this film is about Peter before he became 'PAN', Captain Hook before the dreaded pirate. Open you heart and mind and be a kid again. Enjoy this like I did and continue to. It saddens me that so many out there are lacking the creativity and imagination needed to fully enjoy this film. Life to me would be unbearable without these features and I feel sorry for so many of you lacking this happiness.Much love and friendship your way. I hope you will give this delightful film the credit it deserves. I for one and thankful I was young at heart enough to enjoy. Don't grow up and you'll never be old."

For his part, Jackman is in full pantomime villain mode, he is hamming it u, big style and genuinely seems to be having fun. Too bad the same can't be said for the viewer.Badly written, poor dialogue, bad acting and just corny and cliche as a whole.Pan was the biggest bomb of Jackmans career so far, it grossed just $35 million (on a $150 million budget) at the domestic box office, to end 2015 as the 73rd highest grossing movie of 2015."

It's another hulking and overlong CGI adventure, crazily attempting to tell of Peter Pan's back story in which Hook is a random US adventurer and ally and the big bad is a plummy Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard. Sadly, this misfiring oddity is just as shallow and irritating as Spielberg's HOOK, with misguided acting on the part of the child stars and plenty of ham ladled in from the adults. The CGI ships and scenery looks entirely fake and there's no kind of narrative consistency, the story merely bobbling along aimlessly instead."

If I'm sat there asking myself ""why is it set in WW2 if it's a prequel to Peter Pan?"", ""why have they shoehorned in Nirvana and The Ramones, what's the point?"" and ""why's Hook American?"", it's a clear indication that the film has failed to draw me in and hold me in the world they've created. I didn't rate the performances in the main. Hugh Jackman did a decent scenery chewing job but that didn't help because there's no point to his character - other than to have a bad guy who isn't Hook so they could throw in the twist that Hook and Peter start as friends. And then they failed to do anything with that idea anyway. The original story of Peter Pan drops the seeds of how Peter came to be in Neverland and what made him the way he was.

Why did Wright straitjacket his cast with these stiff exchanges? The film touches on Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars, The Matrix, shamelessly cannibalizing parts from other successful adventures and insultingly thinking we won't notice. The boy playing Pan looks good but acts so wooden he blends into the ship. Everyone else is flat, though the clunky dialogue gives them very little option for nuance. Wright opts for a big blancmange of colour, song and CGI, but it's a mix that falls dreadfully flat.

The film and the script patronizes all involved. Come On! We've had Pirates of the Caribbean. Children are cleverer than we think and they like to be treated like adults. Really disappointed because wider thinking could have made this film bad-ass! It's a good premise but ends up being a good film only for people who don't like to think too much......... For instance, J.M. Barrie only published following the first world war and died in 1937 rather than living through the second world war (when this film is set). Hugh Jackman works with a dreadful script and a character who can't decide if he's the most evil man in the world or just a big softie at heart. This leaves an uncomfortable ill-defined pastiche of a personality. Hugh Jackman obviously just didn't have the confidence to push back against the director or script editors to decide what they wanted! It's a shame.

" Phantasmagoric Visuals, Music, and Imagination Help Pan Fly
",0.4019,0.9985,2017-08-20 00:00:00,9,"Joe Wright's Pan is one of the most recent additions to Hollywood's long history of big-budget, highly publicized box office flops. Think Waterworld, Wild Wild West, or Heaven's Gate. Some infamous bombs, like the ones I mentioned, failed because they are bad movies. Others, like The Lone Ranger or Cutthroat Island are unfortunate victims of circumstance. That being said, I expected 2015's Pan to slip right into that former category. A superhero-style origin story for Peter Pan? There is no set of circumstances that can make that premise interesting to me. So imagine my surprise when this mega-bomb turned out to be a mostly captivating cinematic experience. Pan is a wonder of imagination; the most exciting piece of visual and aural spectacle I have seen in years. It's bizarre, it's not audience-friendly, and it sullies J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan mythology, but for those very reasons, it fascinated me.Pan is the story of a young orphan (Levi Miller) living in London during World War II who is taken to a magical world called Neverland where he searches for his long-lost mother. Along for the ride is a slave named Hook (Garrett Hedlund), who for some unexplained reason is portrayed as a weird cartoon cowboy adventurer, and a native princess named Tiger Lilly (Rooney Mara). The rest of the plot concerns Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) and his mining of Neverland for life-giving pixie dust. Yeah, it doesn't sound good on paper. The idea of creating explanations for the world of Peter Pan and Neverland reeks of Hollywood cynicism at its worst. ""People like gritty reboots, right? Well what if we do that to Peter Pan?"". It has 'disaster' written all over it. And yes, Pan's story is misguided and worse yet, not very interesting. The thing is, this movie is not about story. It's about atmosphere, and on that front, Pan is truly exceptional.Pan was a total surprise for me in terms of tone. I was expecting, justifiably so, a standard kiddie adventure movie. What I got was a daring, eccentric, and decidedly well-crafted piece of filmmaking. This is the farthest thing from the hacky studio garbage the story suggests it would be. What I didn't take into account was the director. Joe Wright, known for the heavy dramatic adaptations of Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, does some real filmmaking here. It is not enough to say Pan is not the hack job it could have been. There are moments are sheer brilliance in Pan. Hugh Jackman's entrance into the massive pixie dust mine, where he is greeted with a haunting rendition of Nirvanna's Smells Like Teen Spirit, or a later scene between Peter and Blackbeard in a shroud of orange sheets are, dare I say, visionary. These scenes, and others like them, grabbed me with their audacity. They have no place in a ""family fun"" kind of film. But Joe Wright was clearly not interested in doing anything safe. Pan is proudly bizarre and surprisingly mature, clearly not made with only children in mind. In fact, this is most certainly not a movie for small children. The clowns that snatch the orphans from their beds are guaranteed to scar even older children for life, and Hugh Jackman's Blackbeard may be more disturbing than any other movie pirate in history. Jackman's performance is over the top, but he doesn't wink his way through the role. He gives room for serious moments, and they work. Jackman has monologues on death that would make Dustin Hoffman's Captain Hook fill his bloomers.Pan is a movie that lives off its visuals and music. Again, the story doesn't really matter. The pleasure of watching Pan is in seeing the strikingly imaginative visual ideas and hearing the mesmerizing John Powell score. Visually, Wright does more than just show pretty pictures. This is as close to a virtuoso piece of image-making that can be done with material like this. Pan is completely original in its look. Apart from the dreary opening sequences, Pan is as bright, colorful, and creative a movie as I have seen in a long time. The Neverland landscapes, the giant skeleton birds, and the multi-ethnic Natives, are unlike anything I have ever seen. From the costumes to the action scenes, Pan is a work of originality and quality in its every frame. As for Powell's score, it is a huge part of why Pan feels like it does. Without the dreamy music, Pan would merely be an imaginative, good-looking, and well-crafted flick. With it, Pan is quite simply, hypnotic. For two hours, I sat there fascinated by what I was seeing and hearing, and it kept me from rolling my eyes at the premise.Here's the deal with Pan. Those expecting a sweet little family adventure, and that's probably a lot of people considering it's a Peter Pan movie, have every right to be shocked by what Joe Wright and company have done. This is an emphatically weird concoction, and that's precisely why I was so taken by it. Considering the scourge of assembly-line drivel passing for entertainment these days, I'll credit Joe Wright for having the guts to think differently. Pan captivated me. Watching it, I forgot about how dumb a concept Peter Pan's origin story is, I glossed over the few lame attempts to pander to a younger audience (I expect these came from the studio to hedge their bets with the kid market), and I sat there, transfixed by the film's mood. Pan surprised me in the way I dream of being surprised at the movies. What had every right to be a disastrous piece of studio garbage turned out to be a bold piece of sure-handed filmmaking. Foundationally shakey, at times visionary, but always interesting, Pan is worth a look, if only to judge it for yourself. What you will make of Pan comes down to how taken you are by the movie's atmosphere. It swept me up.85/100"
" Uninteresting CGI-fest
",0.0,0.6629,2017-08-17 00:00:00,4,"""Pan"" adds an unnecessary backstory involving orphans and the Blitz to J.M. Barrie's famous boy who wouldn't grow up. No longer a wayward child who just wants his own way (and gets it), he's now the ""chosen one"" and his mother some kind of fairy warrior/spirit/martyr. Setting up the sequel, his buddy is James Hook (Garrett Hedlund, channelling Han Solo) and his nemesis is Blackbeard (a hamming Hugh Jackson) who, after ostensibly extirpating the local fairy population, is mining pixie dust to keep himself young. The movie is continuous spectacular, but not especially imaginative, CGI (often involving flying pirate ships) yet lacks any sense of 'magic' – coming across as some tedious mash-up of 'Star Wars' and 'Oliver'. The oddest thing in the film is the use of Nirvana and Ramones songs, perhaps intended to convey the 'out-or-time' nature of Neverland but just out of place and off-putting (and pointless as the songs seem to have nothing to do with the story). Overall, I found the characters and the story uninteresting and ended up watching most of the movie with one eye (the other surfing around on my phone, reading about the original Peter Pan). I'm not surprised that the movie took a pounding in the box office – hopefully that will keep the painfully predestined sequel from being made. ""Pan"" is not quite as bad as the loud and pointless reboot of 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' but that's faint praise."

Everything seemed unorganized, even sometimes forced. The acting was mediocre. One can even argue that there were nothing to actually act on.

I'm shocked at how many of you have little imagination considering Pan is all about never growing up and since you've grown, so many bad reviews reflect so little imagination. Very sad indeed. I've watched this film a few times since it came out and I enjoy it every time. I allow the film to carry me away with it and join Pan on his adventures. Hugh rocked as Hook and every character was complex and rounded. I LOVED this film and while I wouldn't say it was a perfect 10, I gave it 10 to make up for the lack of imagination of so many closed minded grown ups. I believe in fairies and you should too.

" Flawed and Unoriginal
",0.0,0.9493,2017-03-13 00:00:00,5,"As the other review says, this movie is truly awkward and misguiding. There is no originality in the story that was expected before its release when everyone was amazed by the trailer. The story isn't very different from the original Peter Pan story, and it is even less original and entertaining. The story is simply one- dimensional, with its only message being ""don't be a bad person"". There is also no development of character for any of the characters, most importantly for Peter pan. The original movie, although it had imperfect visual effects, faithfully delivered its original message, showing the child Peter growing into a leader. I feel like they have tried to upscale the entire setting of the movie, but they didn't do it very carefully. There are flaws not only in the story but also in the visual effects that are just way too artificial and childish in some parts. The great cast which also raised the expectation of the audience was really useless and all the great actors were covered in awkward imitation of clichéd characters."
" Enjoyable family movie.
",0.4404,0.8409,2017-03-08 00:00:00,7,"I found this to be a quite enjoyable family movie derived from the Peter Pan story we all love. I am not really sure why it holds a fairly mediocre rating on most rating sites. It is undeserved as far as I am concerned.The movie is a prequel which tells the story of how Peter became Peter Pan. I think the story is fairly well done and allows for both adventure and humor.The characters are pretty good although I found Peter Pan to actually be the weakest of them. Hook and Tiger Lily not to mention Blackbeard stole quite a lot of my attention. Peter Pan is not bad just a littlebland.The movie is darker and more real than other Peter Pan movies. Blackbeard is a rather nasty villain and there are certainly more danger for the good guys in this movie. People do not just get knocked down and come back, they really die.The special effects are not bad. I quite liked the pixie swarms at the end of the movie. Also, unlike what some reviewers state Peter Pan does fly in the movie. I can only assume that those who state that he does not never bothered to see the movie to the end. Do not review a movie if you cannot be bothered to finish it for Christ sake! The movie leaves a bit of a whole between the end of this story and the beginning of the traditional Peter Pan story. What happened to make Peter and Hook become enemies and what is the story between Hook and the crocodile for instance? I certainly would not mind a second movie about that."
" Lack Of Focus Leads To Lack Of Audience
",-0.5574,0.9964,2017-02-27 00:00:00,3,"Making a Peter Pan movie is tricky business. You need to inject the project with a heaping dose of fun (what the original is based on), but at the same time treat the material with a certain type of gravitas. In short, you need to be deadly serious but have fun at the same time. That is a concept that only the best directors (see: Steven Spielberg with ""Hook"") can see to fruition. Unfortunately, ""Pan"" lacks the focus to decide exactly what it wants to be, which in turn leads to a very large audience disconnect problem.For a basic plot summary, ""Pan"" begins in WWII England, where young Peter (Levi Miller) is living in a boys home after being dropped on their doorstep as an infant by his mother (Amanda Seyfried). One night, a band of mysterious, flying pirates starts snatching boys from the reformatory, and Peter is included, being taken away on a pirate ship to Neverland. There, he meets Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman), the most ruthless pirate in existence. Peter is not afraid, however, an even demonstrates an uncanny ability to fly, suggesting he may be the fulfillment of an age-old prophecy. Helping him reach that goal is Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara), leader of the natives. Along the way, Peter also meets up with a fellow rebel...James Hook (Garrett Hedlund).Like I said, the biggest and most obviously-identifiable problem with ""Pan"" is that it just lacks a strong focus or sense of purpose. It was advertised quite heavily and mysteriously enough to attract interest, yet it is clearly a children's film from the get-go. It never takes on the gravitas needed to appeal to an older audience. Also, the film firmly sets itself in ""prequel territory"", but then chooses to not develop any of those elements and instead stick to pure adventure. Again, not a terrible approach, but it was as if the film-makers needed to decide exactly what they were doing instead of trying to throw a whole bunch of things in the pot and hope for an edible stew to emerge.The most unforgivable sin of ""Pan"", however, is that it takes the ""wink and nod"" approach to a Pan prequel. Though I know that the Pan canon is all about fun and childhood, it also needs to be ""done with a straight face"", so to speak. As soon as you start treating the story with any less the reverence it deserves, it starts to break down, and that clearly happens here. Instead of trying to actually tell a prequel story, ""Pan"" is only set as such so it can through in a reference to what will happen in the future here and there.About the only positive I can say about ""Pan"" is that it isn't an outright train wreck. I'm sure some children will enjoy it, as they will be sucked into the adventure of the piece. For any more mature audiences, though, it is pretty hollow. 1.5 stars would be my exact rating."
