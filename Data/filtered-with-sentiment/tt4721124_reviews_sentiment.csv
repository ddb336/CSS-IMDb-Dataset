",0.0,0.9485,2021-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Movies are fundamentally made to entertain the watching audience, so why do the know it all reviewers insist on TOTAL accuracy of everything?If somebody gets shot they haven't actually been shot, a sex scene is simulated they are not actually having sex, and on and on. A particular scene might have many takes to get what the actors and director want to show in the movie as part of the entertainment.That's exactly what we get here and in 99.9% of most movies, and it's entertaining and well done and can be recommended, of course you will get the over the top reviewers pointing out that the tyres used on one of the vehicles wasn't introduced into production until much later than the time scale of the movie, so what?It is not a ducumentary to be taken as historically accurate on every minute of the the movie. It is a piece of entertainment based around an historically actual event. Watch and enjoy and don't bother with the tyres."
" Implausible story ruined by overscoring
",-0.4767,0.4019,2021-03-04 00:00:00,5,The best aspect of this film was Christopher Plummers performance.The rest is unsatisfactory.The story is fiction and it is not helped by overscoring of the music which makes the dialogue Difficult to understand.
" Good film, dynamic performance by Plummer
",0.6705,0.9186,2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,This is a good film with an extremely good and dynamic performance by Christopher Plummer. It's hard to believe that Plummer was 86 years old when this film was released and still had the dynamics that were so influential to actors like Al Pacino.

" Excellent Casting (with one exception) and a really enjoyable story of love in war
",0.8016,0.9814,2020-11-05 00:00:00,8,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this superbly well-acted WWII story with 'action' that occurred well behind the lines. I was unexpectedly pleased to find that Jai Courtney was convincing as the Wehrmacht Officer assigned to command the bodyguard for exiled, abdicated Kaiser Wilhelm II (played superbly by Christopher Plummer - this has become my favourite of all his many roles because he played it so naturally that one would be forgiven for forgetting that he is not a grandson of Queen Victoria with a withered/damaged left arm). The direction and script writing was excellent in leaving the viewer for perhaps half the film to query the true character of this German Officer from a family of German Officers. The chemistry between Kai Courtney and Lily James (playing a Dutch woman apparently compelled to enter service in wartime to survive, and with a secret she dare not reveal) seems genuine. The story revolves around two threads - Kai Courtney is tasked to keep a watch-out for a Dutch Resistance worker active in the area of the Kaiser's Country House/Castle (perhaps intending to assassinate the Kaiser), and Janet McTeer (again, superbly cast as the former Empress of Germany) believes - so we do too - that the monarchy may yet be reinstated in the new Germany of the Third Reich.
Ultimately it seems there is deception from every quarter but Jai Courtney finds himself falling for the servant-girl who reads Neitzsche and questioning where his duty truly lies (and he is unexpectedly helped with this by the Kaiser's Aide-de-Camp, brilliantly underplayed by Ben Daniels).
This is not an adventure story, but it is an engaging tale of very different characters adjusting to a very different type of wartime than any had originally expected, some with an hidden agenda and - I have to say it again - brilliantly acted by a superb cast (with one exception, but as that is my personal opinion I shall not share it with you!)"
" Historical revisionism
",0.0,0.9768,2020-09-28 00:00:00,5,"""The Exception"" is a WWII-era romantic and political drama with a cast full of talented, great-looking actors and a lush setting on an elegant estate in the Dutch countryside. The story, however, is out of touch with reality. I could have bought the idea that the two young leads would have fallen in love or at least in lust, because one, odd pairings happen all the time, especially in wartime, and two, they're both extremely good-looking (and eager to disrobe). The way the film shows the two characters' relationship unfolding made absolutely no sense and ruined any romantic tension that could have been portrayed by these two appealing performers. But the character of Kaiser Wilhelm II, played very elegantly by the wonderful Christopher Plummer, seems far nicer than the man was in real life, and far, far more sympathetic to and concerned with the well-being of lowly servants or minor military officers. I just didn't buy that at all. It seemed too far out of character for an exiled royal of the very old school, a grandson of Queen Victoria, to have had much interest in the common folks' pursuit of happiness.My issues with ""The Exception"" lie with the script. As one might surmise from its title, ""The Exception"" is focused on Stefan, the lead character, portraying him as a German military officer who was horrified by the mass exterminations he witnessed in Poland after the '39 invasion. He's meant to be exceptionally humane for his profession and time period, almost evoking a 21st-century-style woke/anti-racist attitude. I could buy the idea of an ordinary German Wehrmacht officer who is a nice guy at heart, and not an anti-Semite or a racist, and someone who just wants to do his job, fall in love, and get along with everyone. Clearly, when Mieke, played by Lily James, stresses that Stefan is the ""exception"" while hateful, monstrous behavior is ""the rule,"" the audience hears the loud, insistent message of the movie. But it felt a little forced to me, maybe historical revisionism, which seems all too common in period films made today. Wishful thinking, perhaps? I prefer a 2006 Dutch film with similar themes called ""Black Book"" starring Carice van Houten."
" It's a comedy
",0.3612,0.8015,2020-09-10 00:00:00,7,"If the Kaiser was so smart as he is in this movie, Germany won WWI."
" awful
",-0.4588,-0.6908,2020-09-08 00:00:00,2,"In the very beginning of the film, there is a scene between the Brandt character and Mieke character that made me nauseous. I will leave it at that, because I am trying to keep out any spoilers, but it set a tone that made the remainder of the movie kind of a dark ridiculous. So much of the essence of the movie depended on a trusting, caring relationship between Brandt and Mieke. After that first awful scene, there was no way that I could be convinced of such a relationship.The only reason I gave any stars is that I did learn a bit more about the nineteenth and twentieth century German aristocracy. Other than that, I am shocked that so many big names were a part of such an awful show."
" Christopher Plummer Is One Extraordinary Actor
",0.0,0.5423,2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"Christopher Plummer is in his old age one of the finest actors the silver screen has ever known. Here he play Kaiser Wilhelm, German emperor in exile in Holland at the onset of World War II. As the suspenseful plot unfolds, his performance draws us into the plight of Germans, including the Kaiser's wife, who began to recognize the evil intentions of the Nazi regime. Reviewers need to remember that this is a movie, the characters are invented, but the point of view is clear and beats the ridiculous premise of films like Inglorious Basterds. Yes folks there were thousands of people who resisted, Germans among them."
" Hidden Gem

" History told through rose tinted glasses...
",0.0,0.9552,2020-04-12 00:00:00,7,"This is essentially a reminder of just how good Christopher Plummer can be as an actor. He portrays the ageing Kaiser Wihelm II in an fashion that illustrates to the audience a kindly old man who feeds ducks - but one who has a temper and still harbours ambitions to regain his throne. Jai Courtney is the army captain ""(""Brandt"") who on recovery from a serious wound, is put in charge of the Kaiser's bodyguard at his Dutch palace now under the jurisdiction of the invading Nazis. Here, he quickly falls for Lily James - the dutch chambermaid who may/may not be a spy out to kidnap and/or kill the old Emperor. There is precious little accurate history to this drama - aside from a visit from a not terribly convincing Eddie Marsan as Himmler. Indeed the personification of Wilhelm is pretty unrealistic; but Janet McTeer shines out as his ambitious wife and Ben Daniels as his honourable, stoic, ADC and all create an enjoyable historical refection on two despotic regimes trying to manipulate the other..."
" A tepid romance
",0.5574,0.9953,2020-03-29 00:00:00,6,"I tried to like this movie, really did, but I just couldn't do it. The history is all wrong, the romance is tepid, & the conclusion is rushed & unrealistic. Many other reviewers have also commented on the historical inaccuracies and I totally agree with them. My biggest problem was that I didn't believe in the love story. Also, for the purpose of romanticization, the basic nature of the Kaiser was altered. So, we got an eccentric yet good-natured grandfatherly figure who takes a deep interest in the protagonists' love story. Why should a deposed king, whose every wish was to get his throne back, care about a romance between two people who were both his enemies in a way? I realize that liberties need to be taken to move the story along & to make the whole situation seem prettier to the audiences. But, in that case, why not call the characters fictitious & then play around as much as you like? The saving grace of the movie is the spectacular performances by the cast. Plummer, McTeer & Daniels are phenomenal. The cinematography is good too."
" Excellent WWII Drama/Romance
",0.5719,0.289,2020-03-23 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't sure about this movie as it started out with a somewhat distasteful first encounter between the lead male and lead female, but as the story unfolded, you get pulled into the drama of all of the characters. The gray area it shows about WWII and Nazis and spies and leaders is well done. By the time the climactic end comes around, you are on the edge of your seat."

The Nazi officer basically rapes the maid the first day he arrives, but since she is a British spy, she decides to go along with his attraction to her in order to gain his trust. After that, they fall in love? This whole part of the story is unnecessary to the plot. The historical aspect is interesting though. There is no evidence this is how it really happened but in the end the plot would have been covered up."

I do find these sexier ww2 offkilter movies very Good. The dark aesthetics and tone and visuals of the black book and now this one.
The exception was a real suprise cause i loved every second of it. WW2 acts merely like backdrop and the rest of the movie is taking place in this beautiful mansion. flamman och citronen also has this sense of stotytelling.

" Well mounted production of a very predictable tale
",0.2732,0.5023,2019-09-23 00:00:00,4,"Mostly a missed opportunity. Strong cast and the bones of a good story, but the relationship at the heart of the film makes no sense and us entirely unconvincing. Predictable plot with all major point telegraphed well in advance."
" Enjoyed this film showing different aspect of WWII
",0.5106,0.8752,2019-08-27 00:00:00,7,"I liked learning about the Kaiser's exile and a small overview of what happened in his WWI decisions. Christopher Plummer did a good job showing the Kaiser in a somewhat unbelievable range of emotions from caring and tender to raging and prejudiced. The only part I found jarring was the way Mieke somehow immediate jumps into getting buck naked and sex on the table with the German soldier with nary a hesitation, despite being Jewish AND a spy. I thought that scene was very strange and tacky. Sure they both have their sexy bods, but was that scene necessary or believable for the story plot - and that afterwards they are all sweet and lovey-dovy doe eyes? It would have made more sense to me if she was doing it for the means of gaining information for her spy-work, some other motivation than just seeing an attractive man at the door for a minute. I didn't like seeing the suffering of the poor pastor, unfortunately that was realistic to WWII events. After the first dumb focus on rampant sex scenes, I found the rest of it entertaining as I was never sure there would be a happy ending. But does the German go to find her or not?? That is bothering me now!"
" Welcoming

This time, however, he had the power to move me to tears. I am not sure whether Kaiser Wilhelm had the same sense of humour and, on the whole, was the same sympathetic character Plummer impersonated. In any case, a magisterial and touching performance."
" Suspend disbelief to accept The Exception
",0.0772,-0.3147,2019-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Christopher Plummer has still got it! This is historical fiction, so the Kaiser didn't come off as historically nasty as he was, but he was no Cap Von Trapp 🙂 this is no Sound of Music! Despite the WW2 backdrop there was no graphic violence; however there were strong references to horrific acts. Love story took center stage and all the actors were on their game. I did have to suspend belief to accept the ""exception,"" but one would like to think that love can find a way"
" A failed attempt for a war drama
",-0.802,0.6457,2019-08-11 00:00:00,2,"2 stars only for Christopher Plummer who is amazing.This film is based in a book that I haven't read, so I don't know if the book is as bad or the film failed to tell its story well.Btw, the events described in the movie are not real, this is mostly fiction.
In any case I didn't feel a thing about the love story, those two never convinced me they cared about each other, I mean how can she love him after what happened in their first scene at his barracks?**spoilers start here**
He raped her. The first moment they were alone together he ordered her to have sex with her.
How on earth he is an exception? How on earth she cared about him?
And even if he helped her escape, he continued helping the Nazis during the war. He is a despicable human being who simply saved a woman he desired.And the problem is their affair is consuming most of the movie.
Yes, the movie is basically about their affair, not Kaiser.**spoilers end here ***The Spy story was also quite average and the only really strong scene of the movie was the dinner with Himmler."
" Prepare for boredom

Those German army uniforms are dead sexy, let's face it, and it's nice to be able to admire them on a ""good"" German. And he looks equally good with his uniform off! The heroine also shucks her servant's uniform to good effect. Everyone acts well with characters being well delineated. Provided you can suspend your disbelief about probabilities, the story is engaging with fiction and historical fact deftly combined. The settings are attractive and the whole thing well done, on a limited budget it appears, which is a lesson on how to get a first class result with no over-the-top special effects. I recommend it to other viewers and my opinion is that the average rating is lower than it deserves."
" Enjoyable war drama
",-0.25,-0.3498,2019-04-24 00:00:00,7,Whilst it's not the best I've seen it was thoroughly enjoyable throughout and highlights the depth Christopher Plummer has to offer with an exceptional performance. If you like war dramas rather than war actions you'll almost certainly enjoy this film to some extent.
" A marvelous story about ""the new and the old"" with a powerhouse performance by Christopher Plummer
",0.5994,-0.93,2019-02-10 00:00:00,8,"The Exception is a great film that does no other film has done before. Bringing the two colossal changes of 20th Century together in one story.In one side, we have Kaiser Wilhelm II, the pathway to the most radical change in history, the death of ""the old way""; the time of romantic chivalry and imperial warfare that always ended up in a status quo in the grand scheme of things. On the other side, we have an extreme ""new way""; Hitler's Third Reich, a radical change that the impredictable chaotic atmosphere of the WWI has brought about. A world where mass murder is seen as the state-of-the-art scientific method to achieve greatness.
All it takes to go from ""the romantic old"" to ""the radical new"" is a war that was fought four times longer than it was expected ( the demise of the frequently mentioned romantic belief ""we will be home by Christmas""), with ten times the predicted death and destruction. And inevitably, a decade of turbulent national economic crisis on the part of Germany.Christopher Plummer ""is indeed"" Kaiser Wilhelm II, what a powerhouse performance. Plummer and Janet McTeer (who portrays Wilhelm's wife, former Empress Hermine) are the embodiment of the Romantic Imperial way of thinking with their exceptional portrayals of the characters.
Eddie Marsan, as Himmler, on the other hand, is a punch-to-the-gut portrayal of the new, monstrous entity that Germany has become after her sufferings since the end of The Great War. His cold, machine-like estrangement from humanity portrays the Third Reich marvelously."
" Great stuff. Can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie this much
",0.8126,0.9246,2019-01-26 00:00:00,9,"What a surprise. The Exception definitely deserves a higher rating. Beautifully cast, sublimely acted, terrifically gripping storyline. I think Plummer should have got an oscar for his performance in this.Marsan is chilling, Courtney is enthralling (love the full-frontal . . .nice), James is enchanting. McTeer also deserves an oscar. Watching her in Mrs. Maisel and then seeing her in this is was doubly fun. What range.Love this movie."

" Cool Kaiser
",0.3182,-0.1054,2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,"""The Exception"" is a little like ""Allied"" inasmuch as it's a romantic WW2 drama made 70 years after the war. Like ""Allied"" it captures a little of the flavour of Casablanca, a romance set against momentous events. Although Ingrid and Bogie didn't burn up the bedroom quite like Jai Courtney and Lily James do in this film.When German officer Captain Stefan Brandt (Jai Courtney) is sent to guard the exiled Kaiser Wilhelm II (Christopher Plummer) at his country estate in Holland, he is ordered by the Gestapo to investigate if a British spy has infiltrated the home. Despite being warned not to have intimate relations with the female staff, he throws caution and uniform aside to engage in a hot affair with a young Dutch woman, Mieke de Jong (Lily James), who also happens to be Jewish. When a creepy Heinrich Himmler (Eddie Marsan) turns up, things come to a head.In a story where the hero is a German soldier who has been wounded invading Poland, you have to sort out his Nazi credentials early and still keep things believable. Captain Brand obviously doesn't like the Gestapo but he is not a committed anti Nazi - at the beginning anyway.However there is a decided distaste for the Nazis in the air especially from the Kaiser himself. He tells how he didn't approve of Hermann Goering when the plus-sized Nazi chief turned up to dinner wearing the wrong duds.Christopher Plummer makes a cuddly Kaiser, but it's a show-stopping performance. Ripped Aussie actor Jai Courtney creates an officer who has seen a bit too much of the war and it's only 1940. Lily James, one of the current crop of beautiful, polished British stars that every generation produces, is a captivating Mieke.Eddie Marsan makes an evil Himmler. He projects a man who rules by terror rather than charisma. The tension ramps up whenever he's around. It's a pity his visit is so brief.""The Exception"" gets more far-fetched as it goes along, but intense performances, great locations and a suitably romantic and dramatic score from Ilan Eshkeri make ""The Exception"" exceptional."

" The Exception - Just Misses
",-0.2263,0.82,2018-10-06 00:00:00,4,"What might have been a reasonable plot tends to be reduced to a somewhat implausible outcome. Several challenging situations are set up, then all solved in equally farfetched proportions - too often stretching the believability factor towards being laughable. Sex scenes are set up too quickly and with crude gratuitousness - leaving no time to develop into any form of believable relationships. There are good looking costumes and sets- but ultimately, it shows up as superficial gloss - without enough substance to sustain its length. Performances are OK, photography is slick, music score is good, just a pity about certain elements of the script."
" romanticized but worth seeing
",0.4215,0.9565,2018-10-06 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this film, particularly the acting of Christopher Plummer. He played Kaiser Wilhelm as a kindly old man, which he had to in order to get the fictional romance aspect to work. The Kaiser was arrogant in real life and definitely an anti-Semite. Hitler had no use for him and thought he was an idiot.Kaiser Wilhelm was in exile in Holland; as in the film, he was offered sanctuary by Churchill in England, but he refused, preferring to stay in Holland until his death at the age of 82. He hoped to be restored to the throne, but that didn't happen.In this story, Mieke (Lily James), a Dutch maid working in the Kaiser's household, is actually a spy feeding information to the local priest. He is using a hidden cipher machine to pass along information, but the Nazis are aware the machine is somewhere in the village.Mieke meets Stefan, the German in charge of guarding the Kaiser (Jai Courtney), They fall in love -- leaving both of them in a difficult situation.More of a romance than anything else, The Exception is a fanciful story with some good performances, including Janet McTeer as the Kaiser's wife and the young James as Mieke. Courtney gives a subtle performance as someone who needs to hide his true feelings."

",-0.34,-0.9391,2018-06-25 00:00:00,6,"The Exception is a decent thriller about a British spy in the middle of German-occupied Holland. It's not horrible, and we didn't hate it.
However, when you watch a movie like this, you get the perception that the Germans were a fine group of men with warm hearts. 
Brant disobeys orders more that he follows them. Like in many other movies where we are supposed to root for the cliched ""good Nazi."" It's not original any more.
In real life, the Kaiser was a major instigator in WW1, but here he's just a sympathetic old man who did nothing wrong. The colonel who runs the Kaiser's household? Yet another Nazi who not only helps the enemy, but he helps a traitor (Brant) to help the enemy. You find out that a staff member is secretly Jewish? No problem, I can ignore my orders because you slept with me.
Let's say you already suspect the maid is a spy. You know she has a gun because you smell the oil. You know she has secret meetings in town because you follow her daily. You know she is hiding the fact that she's Jewish. You know she has military training because she knows all about nazi medals and military ranks. All of these obvious clues, and yet you can't put 2+2 together?
If only the real Germans had so many clueless and nice guys during WW2."
" More of a wartime drama than a war film
",-0.5994,0.9608,2018-06-13 00:00:00,8,"A thoroughly enjoyable semi-historical drama. Although set in Holland in 1940, you can't really call it a war film, since there is no combat shown. More of a wartime drama. Excellent acting, photography, and unobtrusive direction. The only cast members I recognized were Christopher Plummer as the Kaiser, and Janet McTeer as his wife. Excellent performances also turned in by Jai Courtney, Ben Daniels, Eddie Marsan as a creepy Reichsfuhrer Himmler, and the lovely Lily James as Mieke de Jong. Plummer's Wilhelm II was a joy to watch, even if he wasn't accurately portraying the Kaiser's personality. For those who are annoyed by German characters played by actors with English accents, well, maybe it would have been better in German and Dutch, and only subtitled in English.

" wartime espionage
",0.0,0.9827,2018-05-04 00:00:00,6,"It's 1940 Berlin. Army Capt. Stefan Brandt (Jai Courtney) is on the outs after an incident during the Poland invasion. He is sent to Holland to guard former Kaiser Wilhelm II (Christopher Plummer). He follows the victorious advancing German forces to find the former ruler bitter at his losses and his wife Hermine (Janet McTeer) eagerly pushing for the monarchy to be reinstalled. Colonel Sigurd von Ilsemann (Ben Daniels) is the chief of staff and Mieke de Jong (Lily James) is the new maid. Gestapo Inspector Dietrich is searching for a British spy suspected to be in the nearby village. The situation comes to a head when SS Commander Heinrich Himmler arrives to meet Wilhelm.It's an interesting wartime espionage film until Mieke essentially reveals her situation to Stefan. I assumed that she was playing him but apparently the movie was about her falling in love with him. I don't buy this central premise and that does irk me for the rest of the movie. In order to sell him as the Exception, the Poland incident really needs to be the first scene. The movie needs to make him the hero of the piece. I'm not necessarily a fan of Jai but that is all on the movie. Lily James does the best she can and there are some great veteran actors around. They make this better than its worth."

" A look at the German Royal family during the WWII.
",0.0,0.9957,2018-02-04 00:00:00,8,"A book based film, partially inspired by the real, but I really loved. In the backdrop of the world war two, it focused on the German royal family, Kaiser. An officer sent to protect him during the nazi Germany's invasion of Europe, possibly from the spies. So during his stint, all events that unfolded were revealed to us with a twist at the end. The twist was predictable, so they did not hide it for the perfect moment and to make the film entirely rely on it. What's important is it was more a straightforward narration. Though there were some tense moments.Overall a great drama. I did not know what to expect, whether a thriller or romance, but it mixed them all together nicely. Of course, Jai was good, and so Lily James, but I was very impressed by Christopher Plummer. This film was awesome because of this 88 year old Canadian actor. Directed by a newcomer, and he did his part nicely. One of the fine addition to the world war two related dramas. It has a strong sex scene, otherwise would have been fit for all. Definitely I suggest it if you're interested!7.5/10"

" Irresistibly good
",0.4404,0.9991,2017-11-23 00:00:00,9,"British Director David Leveaux's ""The Exception"" builds on an Alan Judd novel and a Simon Burke screenplay in creating a well-done and very attractive film that matches several different wish-lists simultaneously.The fact that Kaiser Wilhelm resided in The Netherlands for years after Germany's WWI defeat is a great story in itself. And this relative of Queen Victoria, though irascible and anti-Semitic, had quite a bit to put up with (not least lifelong disablement of his arm and a faulty balance system). One might, therefore, in the wilder corners of one's imagination, wish to believe that he ended up as a courtly old gent suitable for being played by Christopher Plummer (whom he resembled not a little, if we can believe the photos taken at Huis Doorn - a place not entirely dissimilar from the house portrayed in the film - in which HIM lived from 1920 through to his death in June 1941, along with wife Hermine, whom he loved dearly and was loved dearly by her in return).Plummer naturally attacks the role as if he had been born for it, and it is a singular pleasure to see him deliver some superb lines superbly well. And as regards screen presence, this actor never lets us down, it goes without saying.Hermine is played by Janet McTeer - also a good role, but that of their ADC Sigurd is handled just splendidly by Ben Daniels. We may feel we know all we need to about Sigurd after our first introduction, but in fact the character just keeps on growing throughout the film. It's great.It is to this household that there arrives our hero Captain Brandt - injured, anti-SS and fresh from witnessing (and not standing idly by in the face of) the latter's atrocities in Poland. Nicely for the plot and story (if of course naively), Brandt is still prepared to believe at this early stage of the War that most German soldiers (SS or Wehrmacht) are above that kind of thing - hence the changing significance through the film of the titular word ""Exception"".Brandt seems not especially noble himself (if perhaps typical) in more or less immediately opting to have his wicked way with the gorgeous maid Mieke (played with huge sympathy for the character by Lily James). Those of us always happy to see more of Lily James get to see a lot more, shall we say, but her actual (and in the film's later terms explicable) willingness to accept Brandt's attentions she later very sassily attributes - at the moment of his apology - to her having wanted him too! This is not the limits of the film's eroticism, and it certainly helps along an otherwise-doubtful story element; but it's also genuinely joyous to see an unlikely love blossom between these characters, as built on a healthy foundation of old-fashioned lust! Again - all these years on from the War - one longs for the possibility of ""the good German"", who might act as decently and selflessly - or just in fact as ""normally"" as Brandt increasingly does. This is again a very nice opportunity for - and well seized by - Australian actor Jai Courtney.In general, the palatial house seems to offer a bit of a refuge for an older, somewhat kinder and certainly more stately Germany to go on existing, and so it is with palpable tension that this world is intruded upon by none other than Herr Reichsfuhrer Himmler, who arrives with floozy in tow, does not hesitate to accept money from the lady of the house, and also makes plain, in the course of casual conversation over dinner, his plans for getting rid of excess children. Here we find yet another compelling role, this time for Eddie Marsan. Much as the Imperial couple might have wished to woo - and ingratiate themselves with - their key guest, they rapidly find they lack the stomach for it, and this is a telling moment for the film that does reflect a real-life change of attitude known to history.Himmler's local support already transferred to Holland includes Gestapo Inspektor Dietrich - yet another very nicely-acted if minor-ish part - this time for Mark Dexter.Most of these main characters get to interact with each other, and the dialogue that involves - apart from mostly sounding authentic - is never less than insightful, and occasionally even tends towards the exquisite. Many times I had the impression that the makers have taken care to put the thing across as well as they possibly can. They seem to go the extra mile in many different ways. While elements of the story are in the realms of fantasy, others draw on real issues, and anyway this is a crowd-pleaser that ought to have been true, even if it wasn't. The love-story element again compels because of its awesome simplicity, and one just roots for Brandt to survive the War so he might meet up again with his Mieke. Beyond that, the issues surrounding the exiled Emperor (a gift of a story if ever there was one) are thought-provoking and intriguing.Perhaps I am easily pleased, and I'm certainly a sucker for an old-fashioned love story, but I found this one enjoyable and interesting, with acting and script-writing of a high calibre indeed."

The acting of all main and every supporting actors are nothing short of perfection, especially, of course Christopher Plummer, his role as Kaiser Wilhelm II in this film is my favorite of all of his performances. It is a beautiful romantic story that is also gripping and kept me at the edge of my seat from beginning to end. What a great job for the first time director. This does what a good movie does, lures you into the story and don't want it to end."
" Plodding WWII drama with varying quality of performances
",0.0,-0.943,2017-09-28 00:00:00,5,"Since World War Two was still being fought there have been a plethora of films about the subject, covering almost every side of every angle. Thus to justify another in 2017 the bar must be set high, and while The Exception might be a reasonable way to while away a Sunday afternoon it's debatable as to whether it does enough to justify its existence.Based on the novel The Kaiser's Last Kiss, The Exception focuses on disgraced Untersturmführer Martin Krebbs (Jai Courtney), being sent from the front lines after a confrontation with fellow SS officers in Poland. He is ordered to guard the exiled former Kaiser of Germany (Christopher Plummer), who now resides in the Netherlands. As Krebbs begins a relationship with a maid at the Kaiser's home (Lily James) there is talk of a British spy in the town, as well as German plans to restore the Kaiser to the throne.I'm unsure of the film title, as The Kaiser's Last Kiss feels much more evocative. This relates to my overall problems with the film, as it was often hard to feel sufficiently invested in proceedings. The lack of explosive confrontation and finality relating to the Kaiser himself doesn't justify a meandering build-up. Krebbs and the maid feels more like a tryst of convenience, not the explosive passion that would justify their increasingly erratic actions.This relationship of the officer and the servant girl is as old as time, and reminded me strongly of the 2014 film Suite Française. Coupled with a standard aloof Gestapo agent and the hunt for a spy the whole drama was often formulaic.This is a British cast playing German or Dutch characters, yet some actors have tried on clipped Queen's English, or Allo Allo attempts at German accents, or English with a Dutch lilt. It's so uneven as to be at times hilarious.Accents aside, the performances are a mixed bag. Jai Courtney brings his thumping ordinariness to the British prestige picture, and it would have been preferable to have had an actor who could really delve into the moral maze that Krebbs has found himself in. Lily James drinks up the screen both clothed or otherwise, and any issues with her performance are more to do with a somewhat underwritten character. The film does not shy away from the virulent anti-Semitism that leaves the Nazis so scarred in the Western consciousness. It is an achievement of Plummer to both inspire sympathy as an elderly man the world has passed by, and revulsion as a naive peddler of ugly conspiracy theories. The absolute standout scene of the film features a dinner party with the Kaiser and Himmler (a memorable Eddie Marsan), reminding all of the horrors committed by those who took this nonsense seriously.The whole thing has a sound production design, though the casting left me no doubt in my mind that for all the swastikas and uniforms this was a peculiarly British film. A German language production could have added a level of legitimacy, and a plot with more twists and turns could have led to a greater investment in the Kaiser's last days.christophermarchant.wordpress.com"

" A rollicking good yarn
",0.4404,0.5248,2017-09-24 00:00:00,7,"The Exception works a good premise into a rollicking spy-romance that, once it hits its stride, delivers on both the suspense and the action. In that sense, it's an old-fashioned movie - one that hooks you in, stays just a step ahead and doesn't out-stay its welcome. Christopher Plummer gives a bravura performance as the former Kaiser. Janet McTeer is typically excellent as his wife. And the two young leads are attractive, in and out of their clothes, if no threat to Streep and DeNiro. Okay, so the story doesn't entirely accord with historical fact. Yes, Wilhelm never quite gave up on a restoration of the monarchy. Yes, Hermine actively petitioned the Nazi's on his behalf. But that's about where it ends. In truth, Wilhelm was as much an anti-semite as the Nazis. And the Nazis thought him an old fool, not worth bothering with. Still, it's worth the suspension of disbelief for the duration of the movie."
" Middle of the Road Romance War Drama
",-0.0772,0.9974,2017-08-30 00:00:00,6,"I didn't read the 2003 book The Kaiser's Last Kiss, on which the movie is based. So, I am simply reviewing the movie without critiquing its loyalty to the book.Let me just say, the movie wasn't exceptional in either the good or the bad way. It was middle of the road. You could tell it was a quick stop for both Jai Courtney and Lily James in their careers, before they make it onto the A-List via another movie. In a nutshell the movie checks some big ticket items. Good looking, young, promising main cast. Strong supporting actors with long resumes (I am looking at you Christopher Plummer). A plot taking place around a major historical event. And romance. What more could you want? WellThe main problem I had with this movie, and which is the building block of the whole plot, is their love affair. It starts out so promptly, that I thought I may have missed something. As it turns out, I don't think I missed anything, Lily James' character simply shows up one night at Jai Courtney's door and the rest is history from there. It still doesn't make sense to me, but I gave up and gave in and just went with it. In turn, I was able to enjoy their love story.Historically speaking, if you are looking for a World War II movie, this isn't your movie. Yes, everyone is there surrounding a real life historical person during a real life historical event, but that is about it. It is actually Kaiser Wilhelm II, who is the exception in this fictional romance tale. Overall, there isn't too much on the action front in this movie and is accurately described as a ""romance, war drama"" (Wikipedia).One last thing on the historical front, I do think the movie tried to confront the hard truth of German soldiers during World War II. Just because you belonged to the military, did everyone agree with the overall mission of the Reich? After all, Jai Courtney's German soldier falls in love with a Jewish woman. Maybe love is the exception, but maybe it isn't after all. Who really knows? Instead of the movie taking an in depth look into the mind of a German soldier, it takes the route of romance, which I was completely alright with.As for the acting, I thought they did a good job. While Jai Courtney isn't a stranger to lists ranking poor acting skills, he wasn't horrible. I actually had never heard of him before this movie (clearly I was living under a rock during the Suicide Squad frenzy) and was surprised to find him on such lists. Sure, ""wasn't horrible"" isn't saying much, but he is getting by on more than just his good looks in this movie. I thought Lily James did an exceptional job portraying her complicated character with the tools she was given. Quite frankly, I thought the two of them were a nice pairing. She brought the compassion to his cold demeanor. There are highs and there are lows. You do end up rooting for the couple, who manage to stay alive due to luck and a questionable plot. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and actually liked the ending. I won't spoil it, but it seemed appropriate.At 6.7 stars I expected a bit more, but tend to agree that it is a fair rating. If just looking over the summary of the movie, you would think it could have the potential to be an Academy Award nominee. However, the movie just never gets that deep. It doesn't keep you at the edge of your seat, but it lets you escape into a world where possibly the only exception is love."

And with a bellow average story this was far from a memorable movie.The acting was good enough from the actors. In this mediocre movie Christopher Plummer's acting was one of the good things this production had. I also liked the acting of Jai Courtney. But this didn't gave the actors enough to work with in the first place.There were a lot of very predictable and silly things going on in the story. Those were annoying to watch. For example the last escape was ridiculous. The girl was a spy. What a BIG surprise!! The character development of the Jai wasn't complete. They could've shown more.I was not impressed with this one.

" Not The Rule
",0.0,0.9962,2017-08-15 00:00:00,7,"Novels and films have filled us with possibilities of historical events since the first written words appeared and images on celluloid blasted across movie screens. They give us the opportunity to make the impersonal facts personal, to insert characters into a story filled with what ifs rather than just the facts. Some work, some don't, but most fall somewhere in between. Such is the case with THE EXCEPTION.Jai Courtney stars as Capt. Stefan Brandt, a WWII German officer assigned the task of security for Kaiser Wilhelm II (Christopher Plummer) now safely ensconced in Holland. Brandt is given the assignment in lieu of a reprimand for an event we are not yet aware of as the film begins. The Germans have invaded the Netherlands and the location of the Kaiser is now under their jurisdiction, thus Brandt's assignment.When he arrives Brandt is instructed on how things operate here. The belief is that one day Wilhelm will return to the throne and become king once again. He is still treated as royalty, which he is, and all around him caters to that position. One of the earliest instructions Brandt is given is to never associate with the help.Of course he ignores this instruction the first night when an invitation to dinner the next night is delivered by one of the maid, Mieke (Lily James). Before dismissing her Brandt orders her to strip and has sex with her. Mieke complies without comment and leaves when done. An attraction between the two forms and they meet behind closed doors and in secret from there on.As all of this unfolds at the home of the Kaiser, Gestapo agents in town are seeking a British secret agent rumored to be in town. Scanning with electronic equipment they have narrowed down where orders are coming from via Morse code but haven't pinpointed it yet.As things progress and Brandt comes to know the Kaiser for who he really is, various items are revealed to the viewer. What was the affront committed by Brandt? Who is the British spy most likely located within the Kaiser's staff or on his grounds? And does loyalty to one's country mean loyalty to one's leaders? All things come to a head when a visit by Heinrich Himmler is announced. Himmler informs the Kaiser that he is needed to return to Berlin in the coming days with the intent of placing him back on the throne. In secret he lets the local Gestapo head and Brandt know that this is just a ploy to root out those who still support the Kaiser. The plan sets in motion events that the story has led to at a faster pace.The movie is well made on a technical level. Well shot and staged with solid directing of all involved makes the movie easy to watch. The sets and costuming are well done here, creating a movie that makes us feel we are there rather than one where spotless uniforms are the rule of the day ruining any sense of reality.All of the actors involved do a tremendous job. Courtney stands out offering a low key approach to his character. I feel as if all other films I've seen him in have presented him in an over the top style. Here he plays Brandt as a man thinking and feeling instead of a blustering take charge man. James also does a good job here as Mieke, a woman who is torn as to what to do. And Plummer as always turns in an excellent portrayal of his character.My only problem with the film lies in the relationship between Brandt and Mieke, at least at first. It begins almost immediately in the film and is so abrupt as to make it the one unbelievable moment in the film. Their first time alone together, while not violent, actually amounts to a rape and yet they fall for one another. I found that difficult to believe. To think that they fall in love afterwards is a bit much.With that exception I found the movie entertaining and interesting. The plot is believable and it may stir up interests for some in what really became of Kaiser Wilhelm II for those who do not know. I know that it did in me. In the meantime the movies offers a bit of escape from a historical perspective and is worth giving a watch."

" So So World War II Romance
",-0.2125,0.9709,2017-07-03 00:00:00,5,"This seems to have been assembled out of bits of better World War II movies. It gives us Christopher Plummer doing Captain von Trapp in old age. It gives us, like the superior Black Book, the frisson of a German officer committing Rassenschande with a beautiful and spirited Jewish woman. It gives us intrigue by British Intelligence. It gives us the cousin of that cliché the Good German -- the Honorable Prussian Conservative, a good patriot who wants Germany to win the war, of course, but considers the Nazis to be too extreme and downright vulgar. It meditates on the fine distinctions between people who merely think that Jews are distasteful and altogether to conspicuous and influential, and people who take those opinions to their logical conclusion.What it does have have going for it is that, however improbable the relationship written for them, Lily James and Jai Curry are extremely attractive young people who have a ""boi-i-i-i-ng"" moment when they first set eyes on each other and who plausibly portray sheer animal attraction. Most of what surrounds that is nonsense."
" The Kaiser in exile in Holland
",0.0,0.9979,2017-07-02 00:00:00,10,"The Exception (2016) was directed by David Leveaux. The movie was produced in Belgium, but the dialog is in English. The film is not meant to be a documentary, so we can't take it at face value. However, the basic outline of the story is true. Kaiser Wilhelm II was forced to relinquish his throne after World War I. He spent his remaining years at a secluded mansion in Holland. When Holland was invaded and conquered by the Germans, Wilhelm came under the direct authority of Germany. In the movie, a previously wounded German army captain (Stefan Brandt, portrayed by Jai Courtney) is sent to be the commanding officer of the Kaiser's guard. Brandt is a loyal officer, but he is disgusted by the SS atrocities. He falls in love with one of the maids, Mieke de Jong, portrayed by the beautiful Lily James. She is Jewish, but Brandt isn't anti-Semitic, so he pursues his romance with Mieke.Historically, Heinrich Himmler, the Reichsführer of the SS, did, indeed, visit the Kaiser in Holland. That visit is the lynchpin to the plot. (If the visit had been invented for plot purposes, we wouldn't believe it. However, Himmler really did visit.)The key role in the film is that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, played brilliantly by Christopher Plummer. Plummer is a consummate actor, and he makes the role come alive. I think that the manner in which the Kaiser is portrayed takes the movie the furthest away from historical reality. In the film he's shown as a more-or-less kindly old man who loves to feed his ducks. According to Wikipedia, he remained a harsh, haughty aristocrat. However, the movie will only work if we believe that the Kaiser also has a softer side, so that's what we see.I want to alert IMDb readers to watch for the work of Janet McTeer, who portrays the Kaiser's wife, Princess Hermine. She has no great love for the Nazis, but she is willing to go to any lengths to see that her husband returns to Germany and is restored to his monarchy. She is a German Lady Macbeth--cold, calculating, and decisive. We saw this film at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well on the small screen. The movie carries an anemic 6.8 IMDb rating. It's much, much better than that. The plot is interesting, the acting is outstanding, and the direction is excellent. Don't be fooled by the low rating--this is a movie that I highly recommend."
" Spy drama comes to life in the second half
",0.0,0.9823,2017-06-28 00:00:00,7,"As ""The Exception"" (2016 release from the UK and Belgium) opens, we are told it is ""Berlin, May 1940"" (the Nazis have just invaded Belgium, Holland and France). For reasons not yet clear, the Nazis decide to send Captain Brandt to Utrecht, the Netherlands to guard the exiled Kaiser Willem II. As Brandt settles in, he starts a passionate affair with Mieke, one of the local maids working for Willem II, and she reveals to him she is Jewish. Along the way, we also start to know the thinking of Willem II and his wife, who both still are hoping for a return to the throne. Then the news comes that the Nazis have intercepted morse code transmissions made from the nearby village that an English spy is trying to infiltrate Willem II's entourage. At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the feature-length debut of British director David Leveaux (best known for directing theater plays). Here he brings the book ""The Kaiser's last kiss"" to the big screen. I have not read the book so I don't know how closely the film's script stays to the book. Given that this is a spy-related drama, one mustn't say too much that could give clues about how it all plays out (biting my tongue!). Let me just comment in general that the movie drags a bit (for me, anyway) in the first half, but really comes to life in the second half. Christopher Plummer continues his recent streak of great performances (check out last year's ""Remember"" if you haven't seen it yet!) in his role as Willem II, and Jai Courtney is fine as Capt. Brandt. But for me the movie was stolen, in the best possible way, by up-and-coming (and stunningly beautiful) British actress Lily James in her role as the local maid Mieke. Surely we have not seen the last of her. Bottom line: this is a fine movie, bringing a mix of spy drama and romance.""The Exception"" has been available on VOD since early June, so imagine my surprise when this recently showed up at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely (about 10 people in the theater). If you are in the mood for an ol' fashioned spy-romance movie, you could do a lot worse than watching ""The Exception"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."

I believe music was appropriate, lighting was nice but the whole plot was commonly used in such historical/drama/romance movies. I also believe that in some particular scenes, the fear and disrespect could be slightly more intense. In general good movie, enjoyable but not an unforgettable or a ""muct watch"". My rate 6/10."

",0.0,0.9906,2017-06-26 00:00:00,7,"The film is a typical euro meager budget co-production with a nice little plot and the substance of an eclair, but the delight here is viewing Christopher Plummer showcasing his pure love of acting. He has reached legendary dimensions in his ability and he joyously devours each part he gets these days regardless of the material. He has become in many ways someone he played: John Barrymore. Same love of tricks and hypnotic magnetism. But what a joy to behold. If you want a master class in the study of a near 90 year old acting magician see this!"
" Clever and exciting and romantic
",0.836,0.9891,2017-06-23 00:00:00,10,"This fictional WW2 movie cleverly blends fascinating fact and fiction to create an exciting believable story. If you ever wondered what happened to Kaiser Wilhelm after Germany lost WWI this movie would interest you. Christopher Plummer plays Kaiser Wilhelm II - he really looks quite dignified and royal in his fancy dress and acts very well - remarkable for his age. Janet McTeer provides unexpected comic relief as the second wife of the Kaiser. Lily James plays the Dutch maid who is actually a Jewish resistance spy and she looks quite alluring and shows she is no Cinderella here. Jai Courtney looks quite right as the German officer with a heart.I won't discuss the story because it's so clever I don't want to give it away. Just be assured it is worth watching and actually a better story than ""Allied"". Unfortunately because this one doesn't have a very famous Hollywood movie star it got a lot less publicity which is a shame. Of all the good German stories this is one is very entertaining."
" Delightful war fluff, well acted!
",0.3164,0.9254,2017-06-22 00:00:00,9,"I'm giving this an ""8"" simply for the fine acting and commanding presence of Christopher Plummer (I keep wanting to say ""Sir Christopher Plummer"") as the aged but sprightly and opinionated Kaiser Wilhelm II. I'm torn between calling this the most enjoyable silly film, or the silliest enjoyable film, I've seen in a while, but I found it captivating, even though it's almost certainly sheer fiction regarding any historical accuracy. Although I relished the early and frequent appearance of nudity and rampant sex, what I really wanted more of was extra screen time for the Kaiser's extensive wardrobe of military and imperial uniforms. Notable acting props also to Janet McTeer as the Kaiser's consort, and to Eddie Marsan as a glum, coldly business-like Heinrich Himmler."
" Another fairy tale for children
",0.0,0.9725,2017-06-20 00:00:00,3,"This movie is an absolute trash. It's like a hammock, having more holes than ropes. The creators of that drivel definitely think that the moviegoers are illiterates about the past, so they will swallow all the absurdities of this ""historic"" fake. Any script writer is allowed to add invented details to a historic event. However, those details should be at least authentic and logical, but in The Exception they are opposite of that. The Exception may be a good romantic comedy. But it is not, because it has absolutely no humor, like the Inglourious Basterds,for instance. Anyway, the brilliant performance of Christopher Plummer as Kaiser Wilhelm somehow saves the movie. Plummer is the only actor in the entire movie who behaves like a real historic figure would behave. Jay Courtney is laughable as a Nazi officer. He's authentic only in the sex scenes when he doesn't wear the uniform. Eddie Marsan is even more laughable as Himmler. Apparently the creators of this movie cared only about the box office, and they knew that youngsters will be their major clients. So why to bother about details? The Exception is a kind of movie that you forget next day after watching it."
" kaiser wilhelm in exile
",0.0,0.734,2017-06-16 00:00:00,6,"Kaiser Wilhelm fled to Holland after ww 1 to live in exile. in 1941 after the invasion by Nazi Germany he is watched over by the gestapo. he longs to go back to being Kaiser. a captain, with a mysterious past, is in charge. he falls for a house maid who has an assignment to complete. this a very romantic version of Europe in 1940. and unrealistic. the two leads, jai Courtney and lois van wijk are very good. Christopher plummer is hammy as the Kaiser."
" Exceptional!
",0.0,0.9511,2017-06-14 00:00:00,7,"Another movie in a large amount of World War II movies coming out these days, Lilly James plays a Jewish spy for the Brits who has a forbidden love affair with a German Nazi assigned to babysit the Prince of Germany for Hitler.Christopher Plummer  was so amusing as the Prince of Germany. It was an excellent performance by a seasoned actor. Made me want to know more about the man he played and weather he lives up to the performance.The movie was able to develop a large amount of emotions for me as it comes back and forth from romance to drama to war epic and even comedy.  Very well done (Just a little whimsical to make those dramatic scenes even darker and the darkness of the drama makes you more compassionate about the love story happening.)Maybe the best performance in The Exception comes from Jai Courtney as the German Nazi. Some of the best work he has ever done.  Gives a lot to his role.  Actually a little too much as I saw his penis, but hey it's only fair right as I saw Lilly James' lady parts.Like it a lot."
" Enjoyable with some discomfort
",0.0258,0.4497,2017-06-14 00:00:00,6,"A romantic story in the midst of WW II - a carefully crafted mix of ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Black Book"". Interesting to note Christofer Plummer is involved in the first of those (from 50 years ago) and in The Exception as old Emperor Wilhelm II. Along with Black Book, this film seems to help create a new type of ultra-erotic Dutch Jewish female spy.The historical features underlying the film are reasonably adequate and it is not a bad idea to call attention on some little known aspects. On the other hand, there is some trivialization of tragedy, for instance, in the too unrealistic story of a good German soldier getting into a fight with SS murderers on the front, yet later feeling it to be his duty to his country to live out the war at a desk.Good cinematography and acting."
" Beautiful film
",0.5994,0.9366,2017-06-13 00:00:00,9,There are many WW2 movies and many others based on Hitler but I think this is one unique movie that touches upon what happened outside the world of Hitler's Germany. With a starcast that performs brilliantly the storyline is pretty taut to keep the viewer engaged throughout. A must watch.
" Great Story, brilliant direction and terrific performances makes this film so good!
",0.9436,0.9947,2017-06-11 00:00:00,8,"The Exception is a terrific romantic thriller - a film about espionage and romance. Brilliantly directed and written, this film surprisingly turned out to be a great watch & one of the best movies i have seen this yr..It has an intriguing premise amidst backdrop of world war 2. The film has excellent production design, shot beautifully & has some really fine performances. Actors Laily James and Jai Courtney look terrific on screen and share great chemistry. Sr actor Christopher Plummer who plays kaiser the II gives a heartwarming performance and brings in some light moments. all supporting actors did great job. the background music was also very good. do watch this film...Its R rated so not for kids. Rating- 4/5"
" Interesting Nazi Film
",0.4019,0.9346,2017-06-04 00:00:00,10,"It is very nice to see Christopher Plummer as Wilhelm II, Lily James playing his servant, and Jai Courtney as a Nazi Captain. All of their performances were very enjoyable. The plot is very interesting. It is just a great WWII production in every aspect. The movie includes a plot involving spies in Denmark."
" A beautifully honed film
",0.5719,0.9776,2017-06-04 00:00:00,10,"THE EXCEPTION is exceptional! Based on the novel 'The Kaiser's Last Kiss' as adapted for the screen by Simon Burke and directed with great sensitivity by David Leveaux this quiet little film offers insights into the Germany as usurped by Adolf Hitler from Kaiser Wilhelm II – a portion of history rarely mentioned or filmed. Captain Stefan Brandt, a German soldier (Jai Courtney) tries to determine if the Dutch resistance has planted a spy to infiltrate the home of Kaiser Wilhelm II (Christopher Plummer) in Holland during the onset of World War II, but falls for a young Jewish Dutch woman Mieke de Jong (Lily James) during his investigation. Living in a lavish mansion in Holland the Kaiser is accompanied by his wife Princess Hermine (Janet McTeer), Col. Sigurd von Ilsemann (Ben Daniels), and General Falkenberg (Anton Lesser). When they are visited by Himmler (Eddie Marsan) the energy between Stefan and Mieke strengthens and the manner in which Mieke is saved form discovery as a spy provides a satisfying conclusion to the story.Excellent acting, lush photography (Roman Osin), a fine music score (Ilan Eshkeri), and reminder of the 'transition' between a monarchy and Hitler's Third Reich make for a very excellent film."
" romance between 2 gorgeous people.....
",0.8225,-0.9254,2017-06-03 00:00:00,8,Personally I don't care if the movie is 'historically accurate' as some people point out. I don't think they advertise it as that. The acting was good. They had chemistry which is most important. Someone also said 'this could never happen' well I think when 2 good looking people that are emotionally damaged anything can happen. Now this point is stupid I know but it did keep happening. While sucked into the movie I suddenly got pulled out by how big Jai was in this movie (I suspect he was getting ready for Suicide Squad or had just done it) because he was huge. Don't get me wrong he is sexy AF but I thought 'would a soldier in the era be that big? I mean he is 'beefcakey'. Then I thought how would a soldier keep that body with his shrapnel injury? See I told you dumb thoughts but they did jerk me out of the movie experience but only momentarily.
" Charming romance
",0.8126,0.989,2017-06-01 00:00:00,10,"This, of course is very far from the realities of those dark days of WWII. It is more of a classical historical romance, slightly reminding of Ralph Fiennes English Patient etc...only much more naive, innocent and pure....Little spoilers followingThis could never happen. The romance. The last chance of promising Wehrmacht officer to prove his loyalty and this charming innocent British lass making fatal mistake after mistake starting with telling him she was Jewish. This can happen only in some good, kind classical movies...like this one) Apart from somewhat dangerous idea of making Wehrmacht soldier the British classical romantic hero.... I must say that an attempt of Jai Courtney to play this role was....not quite successful. His role of Eric in Divergent series was much more close to it. Still, great thing that the girl survived. and...personally, there is something that makes sense of this nostalgic atmosphere in a remote manor, where the last Kaiser drifts away into the oblivion. Perhaps...all this was his dream..just one of his dreams and we see all the story from his perspective)) Just a thought....This movie is like a young red wine from the south, you drink it while the cold rain is raging outside and it warms you up....Good sensation)"
" A semi-fictional account of the last days of Kaiser Wilhelm II
",0.0,-0.7883,2017-05-20 00:00:00,10,"Though this movie is not based entirely on factual events much of this movie is based on true historical data on the last days of German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II. The house in Doorn, Holland is accurate as is other historical events such as the Nazi troops stationed at his manor.For students of World War I or German history this movie is a must see.Unlike Hitler, the Kaiser did have morals and religious views that he held until his death despite being largely responsible for unleashing WWI."
