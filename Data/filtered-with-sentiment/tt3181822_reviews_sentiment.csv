" The premise falls flat
",0.0,-0.2082,2021-04-05 00:00:00,4,"The movie sort of goes into a similar direction as Gone Girl does. The problem with that is, that the premise of this movie doesn't work.The pressure that is put on the main character isn't all that bad and on multiple occasions where the main character could escape the situation easily, she doesn't.The biggest problem of the movie is the writing i'd say. It is hard to connect to the tension when it just isn't that bad and also quite easy to resolve.There are worse movies, but I still don't recommend this one."
" Love JLO but it's another story for Claire
",0.3818,-0.8483,2021-04-04 00:00:00,4,"I hate characters who make stupidest decisions. The danger is not going to be lesser just because the characters think smart; the thrill would still be there. In this film, it's as if they are too scared to make Claire think so they made her make the most illogical actions.1. You have a hunch that the person is a killer but you wouldnt tell the cop who you are speaking with. Instead you would run and tell your friend????? WHAT WOULD CAN THE FRIEND DO? WHAT WAS THE POINT?2. The fight scenes - i cant anymore. This is so frustrating. I love JLO but this movie is too badly written. Im sorry."
" Exceedingly terrible!
",-0.5255,-0.9955,2021-04-04 00:00:00,2,"A movie with JLo in a leading role should have been warning enough, but I was still curious.The movie is super cliché, the acting, screenplay, and character development is absolutely terrible.The son and his new friend look mid twenties, to early thirties. How easily the son is swayed and manipulated is hilarious and stupid.JLo's character acts extremely stupid throughout the film, making her extremely unlikable.There is really nothing good about this movie, but here go a few funny scenes:when the father picks up his son from school and lets him drive his car, we immediately cut to a scene where they drive on a twisty mountain road. The son then confronts his father with how he left him or some bs, then proceeds to angrily drive too fast. The brakes fail and they have to drive off into water barrels to stop the car.How did they get to this place without the brakes failing before? I mean the bad guy tempered with the car so that the brakes fail... then the dad drove all the way to the school without any issue, then the son drove to mountain road without problem and then hell broke lose all at once!Didn't they talk before this scene or why did they start arguing just there?Why do you hear the car shift and accelerate after each corner? Why is he still on the throttle? Even without braking the car should slow down at some point, or did everything fail at the same time?When they crash into the barrels you can clearly see that the car has zero scratches... probably rented the car for a day and couldn't break it within budget.the bad guy completely mutualizes another student, who now apparently has a broken skull... the co-principal now argues and argues with the and guy and ultimately decides he is suspended.Errrr what? How is this big not a case for the police? He almost killed another student and is apparently 19, looking 29, and is not behind bars? This is never ever mentioned or considered? Okay...Awful movie, Skip this!"

WAS HE OF COURSE NOT WHY because Students these days get away with everything. Then that Women NEXT DOOR ALLOWED HIM INTO THE HOME. As soon as he even THOUGHED HER ONCE. She should of had him thrown out of that House. She NEVER CALLED the Police on Him. If my Son ever took off with him I would of Called the Police for many reasons. He is mouthy, he has an terrible attitude, he follows her around even tho we live next door. He should be leaving or going at divernt times. Now that can happen why do I say that because I seen it happen before when some people didn't get along with there NEXT DOOR NEITHERS. If they didn't follow the RULES they got Charged and some had to move. This Film was lame and STUPID."

But the 2nd half of the film it just all falls apart, loose writing all over the place, multiple things unexplained and just overly predictable.
If it wasn't for the successful start this would be a 3/10.
Noah assaulted someone and fractured their skull. Okay, why the hell was he not arrested?? Just went on like everything was fine. Without details, there was also multiple other scenes where it doesn't get explained and it gets frustrating.
Very annoying to watch. Probably worth missing this one out in all honesty."
" Don't visit The Boy Next Door
",0.0,-0.9991,2020-02-03 00:00:00,1,"Here's a thriller in which a teenage hunk seduces a mum twice his age and then stalks and threatens here while made to be as over the top as possible. If you're going to make an R rated ripoff of ""Fatal Attraction,"" at least have the decency to make an ""erotic"" thriller and not a thriller, which gets marketed as ""erotic."" Director Rob Cohen holds every resistant possible, no doubt at studio demands, to sell this to teenagers. Add Jennifer Lopez, who, for sure, had a no-nudity clause in her contract, and you get ""The Boy Next Door."" A cheesy title to a film that is the prime example of a studio taking advantage of audiences in January, the month where movies go to die with little fanfare.It's about an English literature teacher, Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez), who separates from her husband, Garret (John Corbett) after she catches him cheating on her with a secretary. Not long after, she meets Noah (Ryan Guzman), who has just moved into the house next door with his uncle and Noah becomes drawn to Claire. While her son Kevin (Ian Nelson), goes away on a fishing trip with his dad, Claire ends up sleeping with Noah, despite her hesitation. A one night stand is not what Noah had in mind, and when Claire tells him she regrets what happened, he begins an attempt to tear her life apart.Certain aspects of the thriller genre blend well together from erotic to intensity, but this garbage proves that thrillers are dying. It's even sadder when ""thrillers"" are reduced to everything within and surrounding the concept are either one-note or just plain stupid. This movie's most significant problems lie within the writing and the acting. It opens with Claire being sad for herself because her husband gets caught cheating with another woman. She lives in the San Fernando Valley, serving as a single parent to her teenage son, Kevin. At night Claire wears tank tops, and Jennifer Lopez, 45, is a force of nature to behold. She goes out on a miserable double date with her best friend, Vicky (Kristen Chenoweth), and when she comes home, Noah catches her watching him change clothes through her window.With her son away, Claire, after drinking a few glasses of wine, gives into Noah's flirtations, and she sleeps with him. The next morning, Claire regrets her actions and begins to worry who will find out, and when she rejects Noah, he becomes a clingy, volatile, control freak, and when he punches a hole in a wall in a fit of rage that should be Claire's first clue that there is something wrong with this guy. He acts like a child as he stalks her, and he is never really that menacing. We get the hint that the reason he is an orphan and living with his uncle is his fault somehow, and it is. The explanation is stupid as hell. Noah goes about elaborately threatening to expose Claire sleeping with him. Instead of going to the Police, we would have no movie; she plays cat and mouse game with him as she stumbles about trying to run from him, placing herself in further danger.Noah does not come off as a believable villain due to his pretty-boy looks. The first time we see him, it is his muscular pipes seen before we see his face. You can never really believe that a 19-year-old kid would go to this much trouble to destroy someone's life and have the efficiency to do it. He even goes as far as to manipulate Kevin into hating his father, causing him to lash out at Garrett. He also beats up a bully at school who is bothering Kevin, causing him to become violent. Noah starts to lose it when he sees Claire and Garret, together after a date, and this elevates his obsession with her.From here, there are multiple instances of elaborately threatening behaviour. Noah continues to stalk Claire to the point of lunacy, and it even goes as far as to add an attempted rape scene that is right out of place. The kid is not menacing, nor does he come off as a rapist. There is also a useless subplot involving a sex tape that is used as blackmail for stupidity if she does not do something. Of course, she refuses, and this makes him crazier. With the help of a detective, she learns the truth behind why Noah is living with his uncle and what has made him go berserk, and it's a pathetic excuse. Its climactic showdown in a burning barn of all places gets graphically violent, and it is insane with hammers, crowbars and an Epipen, that you'll wish you had a walked out in the first act."

" Dross
",0.0,-0.9935,2019-10-24 00:00:00,1,"Infidelity. Oral sex. Argument. Keywords for this film ? No mention of the horror and the extreme violence of the film, and also the UK DVD has an 18 certificate and the certification here says 15. No fifteen year old should see this film, as one of the victims of the deranged young man is about that age. What he sees and experiences in the final scenes of this dross would once upon a time have been toned down but given this is normal 21st Century viewing why should it be ? Every time I turn on late night films on television I see fragments, and worse than what I sat through here. So why did I watch it ? A friend brought it over and says this is fun and to please this friendly acquaintance I watched it with him. By the end I felt sick of what our current society considers entertainment. In films like this the woman pays for her adultery ( she is separated from her husband ) and of course she has to run the gauntlet of abuse, seeing people close to her tortured, one to death but never fear at the end the family unit is saved!!! The typical American trope that makes all the horror ' come out alright '. The disturbed torturer ( never mind really why he got that way ) gets his ' just ' punishment and here the camera really loves to see his suffering. I will take a risk on this being a spoiler. As for the acting I will not be generous as it was lamentably awful. The direction had no tension, just assault tactics. I sat through Pasolini's ' Salo ' and was revolted, but there were in my opinion justifiable reasons for the horrors there. There was no justification for this, except for the conservative view that a woman of a certain age should never go with a young man of twenty. I suppose for this crime she deserved what she got!!! Despite the fact that the inevitable ' pretty ' boy looked older. This whole mess merits a zero, so I give myself I for being polite to a friend and sitting through it."

" No build-up

Hard to care about anyone in the film, but I suppose Jennifer Lopez did ok.There was no tension, no nothing. Just an irrational stalker and a slightly annoying victim. The thing I love most with stalker movies is that time when the victim isn't quite sure what's going on, they just think the stalker to be is acting a bit weird. That was completely missing here, stalker went from nice guy to maniac straight away and that is when the fun stopped."

Mortified by her indiscretion and finally ready to welcome her husband back into her life, Claire tries to break it off, but Noah's interest in her turns out to be more of an obsession and one which he'll kill in order to feed.The Boy Next Door definitely qualifies as a low budget thriller. Despite being made for just $4 million by a first time writer and unknown director, they've attracted big enough names to lure audiences.Chenoweth shows some range outside of her twee, grinning showgirl bit, holding her own against psychotic Noah and Lopez is as good a girl-next-door as ever. You wouldn't expect to see these two in a quick and clever thriller and it's wise to approach The Boy Next Door with that level of expectation.
While it starts off well and there's some palpable tension throughout, rather than building to a climax, the story unravels away from those trying to tell it until it's trashed by an inexplicably gruesome final scene."

" The Boy Next Door - Spoiler Free Review
",0.5106,0.9905,2018-09-17 00:00:00,4,"Noah Sandborn's life is going well, he just moved in with his uncle, he's gone back to high school to finish his final year, his teacher/neighbour (Jennifer Lopez) is creepily watching him undress through the upstairs bedroom...yes life is going well for this attractive, charismatic young man. Until on stormy night, tragedy strikes, something he could never have expected, something he could never have foreseen...he under cooks his chicken, luckily Jennifer Lopez goes over to save the day and he thanks her by sleeping with her, so life is good again. The next morning though, his life is shattered once more when J-Lo calls their night of passion a mistake that should never have happened, Noah, obviously, doesn't take this rejection too well, so starts stalking her and trying to murder her family...perhaps a little over dramatic on his part, but then again, this is the risk J-Lo took when she slept with one of her students; he still might be the real victim here.
'The Boy Next Door' is your absolute standard stalker film, starting with one night of passion that obviously means more to one than the other, sending that person over the deep end and making him accomplish feats that makes you just want to employ him for his amazing time management. Jennifer Lopez does her best homage to her portrayal in 'Anaconda' bringing to screen the same amount of likeability and sympathy we felt for that character; I'm glad that she's at least kept her acting consistent for 18 years. Ryan Guzman does bring some creepiness to his portrayal of Noah Sandborn, but at times is just too over the top to really be taken seriously. He handles his transition from nice guy to psycho pretty well, but, as is usually the case with these movies, the writers kinda screw him in that department, making the transition instant, instead of just taking some time to show a rapid decline into madness, as is usually how it works in real life. His actions are exciting at times, and although predictable, isn't completely insufferable to watch, which basically sums up the movie as a whole as well: it really isn't any better or worse than the other films that followed this exact formula, so if you're a fan of 'Swimfan', 'The Roommate', 'Single White Female 2' and the 100s of other identical films, you'll probably enjoy this just fine."

Besides, the connection was clear between the two leads.

It suffers hugely from having Jennifer Lopez as the miscast lead, because she fails to invest her character with any particular personality or wit, and she's entirely unsympathetic to boot. There were only two scenes in the whole film I liked, and the blind date is one of them, but the rest is just ho-hum. As the story's antagonist, Ryan Guzman is laughably out of his depth and entirely unimposing, as well as qualifying for one of the oldest supposed teenagers I've ever seen. The story plays out slowly and predictability, nothing that hasn't been done before, and only picking up in the last ten minutes for a cliched but amusingly violent showdown."

" ""And here's to you Mrs. Peterson. Jesus loves you more than you know.""
",0.5719,0.0768,2017-08-06 00:00:00,5,"""And here's to you Mrs. Peterson. Jesus loves you more than you know."" This movie is a twisted version of ""The Graduate"" (1967), although not only has Mrs. Robinson become Mrs. Peterson, but in this movie it is the teacher being seduced. Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman) moves next door to Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez), a teacher of Classical English Literature at the high school Noah will be attending. Claire is on rocky terms with her husband as the two struggle to be civil for the sake of their son Kevin (Ian Nelson). Noah is orphaned, and has moved in to help his elderly uncle who is going for an operation and Noah intends to provide help as he recovers. Noah quickly befriends the Petersons, and one night, while home alone, he calls upon Mrs. Peterson to come to his rescue on a failed attempt to make a chicken dinner. She goes over, and Noah seduces her, and in the vulnerable state she is in, she succumbs. The next morning, when Mrs. Peterson tries to say what a mistake had been made, we see Noah has become obsessed and now has this incident to use as blackmail. Part of the problem with this movie is there is not enough character development. It would've been better if it toyed with your emotions, making you first really like Noah before he becomes evil; but the movie gives you a creepy feeling about Noah right from the beginning, in his action, in his dialogue, and even in the music they play right from the opening credits. Overall the whole plot is pretty far-fetched. Not a great work of art, but bottom line the movie does make you wonder how it's going to end. Unfortunately not even the ending is that exciting."
" Worthy in places, but also formulaic and over the top
",0.4854,0.997,2017-07-02 00:00:00,5,"Somewhere buried in Rob Cohen's 2015 film ""The Boy Next Door"" there was both a better thriller and a greater dose of eroticism waiting to get out. A pity that that potential was not realised.Given the presence of two pretty attractive actors in the (great) shape of a 45-year-old Jennifer Lopez (playing Claire Peterson) and a 27-year-old Ryan Guzman (playing Noah Sandborn), as well as a seductive enough title, those watching this film think they have a reasonably good idea what they are letting themselves in for, but - even in the work's own context - the titular ""boy"" is already 19 years old (to say nothing of the real age of the actor), and he's only lingering on in school at all because of the need to make good past misdemeanours.Hence the safeties are firmly on here, and all the more so as things move on from the first (non-sinister) part of the film to the second (highly, indeed ludicrously sinister) part.Now there is definitely merit in warning one and all that first encounters with psychopaths may (quite ""unfairly"" as it were, for the rest of us) see them achieve more-than-normal success in sociability, and in charming and pleasing and attracting those around them. However, Guzman's Sandborn is at first SO appealing, and then later SO hideously and dangerously awful, that we are seeing clichés in full action, and also sadly ignoring the increasingly-established fact of a spectrum of types of psychopaths - or rather sociopaths - since the former term (useful for normal people) is now (typically and annoyingly) rejected by the psychiatric profession.We are told that many professions have their shares of semi-psychopaths who get on because of that mindset, and don't obviously or necessarily murder (or even physically hurt) people, as the cliché might suggest. What's more, we sheeplike others may be more than willing to follow these people, especially when they turn on the charm - as they invariably do. This is worth knowing, frustrating in the extreme, and worth worrying about, I believe...How much better a film we might have had, then, had the contrast between the superficial Sandborn and his true inner self been just A BIT less extreme. But to do that would have left Claire Peterson in more of a grey area, while this film eschews ""shades of grey"" (if you'll forgive the pun). It - wrongly - endeavours to keep things clean, despite it's fully-adult language and potentially dodgy themes. (In this respect, Claire's less-than-squeaky Vice-Principal, Vicky Lansing - played gutsily by Kristin Chenoweth - comes over as more authentic at times than she does).So let's be clear - Sandborn is doing what comes naturally to him and exploiting the situation he's found himself in. His OTT criminal and evil side, not visible at all at the start, of course condemns him totally in the second part of the film, but at the outset (in what seems like a rather different, more interesting, film) he's playing it as a lusty young man (no ""boy""!) who finds himself living next door to a (mainly) unattached ""mother I'd like to ... fraternise with"". He can help with the repairs, help Claire's son man up, and he even likes (and can quote from) classical literature which Claire teaches. Annoyingly, if crucially for that second film, he later becomes a student in Claire's class, but she DOES NOT firmly know he will be her student when the pair have their (sadly one and only) hottish amorous encounter.Hence her protestations of it being ""wrong"" look a bit pale, given the presence of two unattached adults (admittedly with an age gap, but who cares?) not even at that point connected by a developed teacher-pupil relationship. Just how illicit is all this? Unforgivably, by the way, it should be noted that Clair says ""no"" to Noah's advances several times, before going on to say a big yes, plenty of times, as it were - the kind of moral/legal ambiguity that messes further with the core message of the film and is indeed quite a ""wrong"" thing for responsible film makers to do. It's also rather unfair and false of Claire, given the bald truth that she has been liking/admiring and then fancying Noah for a while now, and - in a braver film than this one - would NOT have resorted to the suggestion that Noah had (SLIGHTLY) taken advantage of her when she ""was vulnerable"", but would rather have admitted that she was thrilled and flattered and made lusty by the advances of a young stud that she was very attracted to.Not in this film, we don't! Hence, things are kept tritely clear cut. She feels guilty and regrets everything, while he goes off the rails completely, leaving her looking unambiguously ""in the right"" but also in an ""if only I'd known"" circumstance which lays waste to the touch of ambiguity and eroticism from the first part. And so to the relatively predictable second half of the film, which is done reasonably well, but offers very little that we haven't seen before (as well as a great deal that we do (actually did) see in the pretty awful 2014 Dan-Stevens-not-doing-Downton-Abbey-any-more vehicle ""The Guest""...) Mostly rather a wasted opportunity, then..."
" Entertaining escapism
",0.4404,0.5013,2017-05-20 00:00:00,6,This is not as bad as some of the reviewers make out. I have seen far worse. It is a story that has been told many times before. It is entertaining. The type of movie you grab some popcorn and don't think too hard about. Jennifer Lopez is not a great actress but she is easy on the eye and the film exploits that repeatedly. It has some exciting moments and Ryan Guzman is very menacing in a number of scenes. The ending is a bit unrealistic and some of the dialog cheesy. It won't win awards but as a piece of escapism it was enjoyable.
" Spoiler Noah would have been arrested
",-0.4767,-0.7631,2017-04-29 00:00:00,2,Noah would have been put in handcuffs and sent in jail for beating up the student and hitting the vice principal in any real school. But then the movie would have ended there. A teacher does not confront an out of control student like Noah without calling the police. No violent student like Noah would be allowed to stay in school. Lame plot.
