" A quality remake of a classic spy movie
",0.0,0.25,2021-03-26 00:00:00,8,An entertaining remake of a classic spy movie that doesn't assume the American audience is all idiots or millenials that want non-stop actionwith no plot.
" Oh Hollywood, I fail to understand you at times!
",-0.5848,0.8618,2021-03-26 00:00:00,8,"This is a near perfect film of the spy genre. No outrageous plotholes or hyper-realistic gadgets, and an extremely talented star cast to match the thrilling screenplay. Plus, the fresh faces actually works in its favour, instead of having to stick to actor stereotypes. I don't know why this didn't work well."
" Worth it all the way
",0.2263,-0.3319,2021-03-24 00:00:00,9,Really entertaining and sadly there is no at least a second one!
" Guy Ritchie is all about style
",0.0,0.9714,2021-03-08 00:00:00,6,"Like so many other movies from Guy Ritchie ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" is more about style, than it is about substance. The story is pretty interchangeable and has been done before. And we have also seen this type of buddy-movie many many times before and with movies like ""Hobbs & Shaw"" we will continue to see them in the future. But this type of movie and this type of storyline has arguably never been done in quite such a stylish manner.
The coloring is great, the casting choices are superb (although given recent events involving Armie Hammer his casting might have a bad aftertaste for some viewers).
The humor is good, although it does feel a bit out of place at some points in the movie and is sometimes just badly timed.
One thing that is considered great by some, while annoying and out of place by others, is Ritchie's use of zooms and his unique movements with the camera in general. I for one find it quite refreshing to see some long-takes and zooms, instead of the usual quick-cuts and shaky-cam-footage that has become somewhat of a standard in most action movies.
All in all it is a fun and gorgeous movie, but nothing really special."
" The copycat of a James Bond movie
",0.0,0.9324,2021-03-05 00:00:00,5,"Copied from a ""spy who loved me"".
Turns into a comedy just after the first few scenes. The lead actress could win the razors award for the decade! Mr director: you can do better..."
" Hot!
",0.0,0.6498,2021-02-20 00:00:00,9,"Why so much hate for this film? I've seen it twice and loved it as much both times. The action is great, the script is funny and it stars two of the hottest actors in Hollywood. Plus a great supporting cast. I long for a sequel but alas I apparently won't won't be getting one."
" Amusing action movie
",0.3818,0.9361,2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Enjoyable action moview with some amusing moments Wasn't sure if it would live up to the original action/spy movies, but was pleasantly surprised as it carves out its own niche. Particularly enjoyed the scenes where the 2 agents first encounter each other"
" Plot was not very clear at all
",-0.3401,0.7351,2021-02-08 00:00:00,6,The few action parts were ok but I just couldn't follow the plot. Pretty boring. Don't think I'll try any guy Ritchie movies in the future if this is what they are like
" Great Spy Flick 7.5
",0.6249,0.8934,2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Not quite the level of a good Bond or Mission Impossible movie, but a good dang good movie none-the-less. Henry Cavill is especially good as ""Napoleon Solo"" and everyone else is pretty decent too. Forget the cheesy 60's tv show, this one shouldn't be mixed. It's just too bad they didn't make a sequel or two."
" Why?
",0.0,0.7418,2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"Have some respect for yourself, you're humans! You must have a taste and protect it!"
" I want a sequel
",0.0772,0.5709,2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,Highly entertaining. This should have been released at a different time to avoid same genre movies and would have appealed to a wider audience. Definitely needs a sequel.
" Lots of fun. Couldn't get into the characters
",0.5106,-0.2596,2021-01-15 00:00:00,6,There wasn't much from any of the three main characters that made you love them. Not much story and not entirely believable. Especially Vikander who seemed start with a Russian accent then it was American then British?? Not sure but was distracting.
" A great fun, action, non-stop film
",0.8126,0.9559,2021-01-05 00:00:00,9,"One of the rare films that actually deserved a sequel, bizarrely the box office said no. Great chemistry with the cast, all seemed to have fun, full on action from start to finish, super music, comedy and just plain great fun. WB missed a trick on this one, a sleeper that you can always return to, makes moolah."
" Amazing aesthetics
",0.5859,0.9594,2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,"The characters, the clothes, the architecture.... it all exudes class and sophistication. The visuals are the best of the 60s.
Great dialogue, great acting, very funny.I love this film!"
" Forget this one, get a different director and start over.
",-0.2263,-0.3438,2020-12-27 00:00:00,1,This is a huge disappointment. I won't waste anymore of my time over this flop.
" Absolutely brilliant
",0.624,-0.128,2020-12-24 00:00:00,10,Probably the best movie I've seen in this genre. Too bad there is no sequel
" I liked more than I thought.
",0.4215,0.9423,2020-12-05 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't expecting much but the usual Hollywood atempt of a spy movie, however I was beyond wrong.The plot is as interesting as funny and the chemistry between Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer and Alicia Vikander is just on point.A very nice surprise!"
" GIVE US A FREAKING SEQUEL ALREADY
",-0.4215,0.7684,2020-11-27 00:00:00,10,"Great film, can't lose cast, what the heck is the hold up?! It's a franchise waiting to happen."
" Wake me up when it's finished
",0.0,-0.0274,2020-11-23 00:00:00,3,"A snoozefest from start to finish. The parts meant to be comedy are just not funny, and the action parts are constantly interrupted and belittled by lame attempts at humour. Nausea-inducing cinematography including shakycam, extreme close-ups and rapid sweeps seal its fate. Rather rewatch a James Bond movie for serious action. Or watch Condorman (1981), an underrated classic, if you prefer comedy. Spies Like Us (1985) is a slapstick alternative."
" Great!
",0.6588,0.6696,2020-11-19 00:00:00,10,Cavill Hammer and Grant in one movie?... This is a treat!
" Solid Storyline with many likeable characters
",0.5574,0.9987,2020-11-17 00:00:00,9,"Although this movie came out in 2015, i'd never heard of it. I had never seen a movie from Guy Ritchie but I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked the storyline. It was really clear and good to understand. The actors were really good. I mean the moment I saw that Armie Hammer played in this movie I kind of assumed the rest of the actors were also going to be good. Henry Cavill is such an intimidating actor that always seems to be in control. Armie Hammer is also a really intimidating actor. I loved that on one side they had amazing chemistry but on the other side they were so different from each other. Alicia Vikander is also an amazing actress. In this movie she seems like a side character bit mid-movie she reminds everyone she is so much more than that. The storyline itself is so well thought. I loved the beginning. Ritchie immediately draw the attention with the way of filmmaking he does. In the first few minutes he had me in the whole 60s England vibe. The cinematography of this movie is so unique, some shots were probably filmed with a drone of with a lot of special effects. The music was also really good. I loved the diversity of genres. We saw Action, Thriller, Detective stuff and Comedy. In movies it's hard to make me laugh but I really found jokes funny in this one. Overall: Great actors, amazing cinematography, solid and well produced storyline and just very well made!"
" Ritchie's James Bond
",0.0,0.9806,2020-11-17 00:00:00,7,"If I were to describe this film (which is basically what I'm doing) that would be that it is Guy Ritchie's take on James Bond. In fact, I noted that when the original series was released, Ian Flemming was actually a consultant, which is probably why there is a lot of James Bond in Napoleon Solo. However, like many of Ritchie's main characters, they also tend to be crooks, and in Solo's case he happens to be a lock smith that just happened to have been recruited by the CIA.The thing that stands out about this film is that the two characters really seem to rub up against each other, another thing that was taken from the series. Basically, at the beginning Solo crosses into East Germany (it's set during the Cold War) to bring out this mechanic who's father had disappeared and they need to locate him since they believe that he has developed a rather nasty nuclear bomb.Anyway, what ends up happening is that both the United States and the Soviets decide to join forces, so of course Solo's nemesis ends up becoming his partner, and of course that does end up with some interesting scenarios, something that Guy Ritchie does tend to be particularly good at. Also, the character of Napoleon Solo is also pretty cool, though it has been suggested that he is somewhat more of a laid back version of James Bond.Yeah, this film wasn't bad, though I probably wouldn't put it up there with some of Ritchie's best stuff. Of course, the ending, not surprisingly, has them set up the organisation that becomes known as UNCLE, though I have a feeling that a couple of the characters were added later (such as the girl, who I believe doesn't appear in the original series, but rather in a spin-off series). Okay, while I've not really seen any of the original shows, I do have to admit that I didn't like Ritchie's rendition of it, even though, as I mentioned, it really isn't one of his best."
" Lost interest
",0.1779,0.6563,2020-11-12 00:00:00,1,"Having watched the original series as a kid, I was excited to see this. I could only stomach about 20 mins of it before I turned it off. The scene where the cyborg-like Russian spy runs up and jumps on Solo's getaway car was stupid enough, but when asked why he didn't shoot the guy hanging in front of him on the trunk, he replied,""it just doesn't seem right"" or something to that effect. That's when I shut it off. I didn't want to waste any more time on it."
" Just perfect. It's a shame this film is not a blockbuster.
",-0.3707,0.8479,2020-11-12 00:00:00,10,"Great casting, directing, music, visuals, costumes.
Please make more like this."
" Hell yeah!
",-0.5707,0.7249,2020-11-11 00:00:00,8,"2nd time watching this movie and I love it even more now. The way it ends just begs for a sequel. Come on, let's GO!! Armie is down, and so am I. Thumbs up!"
" Sequel Please!
",0.3802,0.9357,2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,Love it!!! Great editing and amazing acting! Alicia Vikander and Armie Hammer were standouts. Need a sequel!
" A classic Cold War spy thriller with razzle dazzle to spare
",-0.5423,0.9839,2020-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) is a CIA agent working in the Cold War era. His most recent assignment in Berlin has brought him together with his counterpart, Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), who works for the KGB. Together they must travel to Italy to hunt down a Nazi scientist, who's building a nuclear device. They're joined by Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), the daughter of the scientist.Yes, it's a cheesy plot idea, but Guy Ritchie has enough style to pull it off. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is nothing if not effortlessly too cool for school. Cavill and Hammer bicker like an old married couple, while shooting Nazis and pulling off daring stunts, but they're also perfectly capable of complimenting each other on their suit selection or their taste in whiskey. And meanwhile Gaby plays the role of a straight man in this setup, rolling her eyes behind their backs.And it just works. Sure, the film is a tad convoluted and I do feel that the final confrontation could have been snappier, but there's simply something about this era and this style that tickles my fancy. It's not exactly a pulp adventure, but it's in the same ballpark, and its strong suits are the same as those of Indiana Jones or Sean Connery's James Bond.I really hope Guy Ritchie manages to get a green light for a sequel because I really want at least one more of these."
" Perhaps
",0.0,0.7964,2020-10-31 00:00:00,3,"Not quite in my mind, but maybe others like it. Good movie."
" Sequels?
",0.0,0.9657,2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,"Ehm, why are there no sequels for this film?
This was super fun to watch. Perfect amount of action, cool cast, lovely photography, scenery, story.
More plx! :D"
" Dieing for a sequel !
",0.0,0.9986,2020-10-28 00:00:00,10,"I think this is the first review I made but I just love the movie.
First of all for the life of me I simply don't get the low box office, or the lack of more success.
The music was absolutley spot-on in every scene, especially the sandwich one or the scooter and hotel one.
The suits and all the dressing are sublime as too be expected in a Guy Ritchie movie.
The story's great, it's a 60's spy story with none of the modern tomfoolery and with all the classic charm and wit of it.
The acting, oh the acting, Cavill is simply perfect as a suave, full of charm Napoleon Solo. To be honest while I did like him in Man of Steel, this is the movie where I trully fell for the actor and all his acting chops. Also for the life of me I can't understand how the producers of the Bond series can ignore such an actor that is trully Bondier than probably half of the actors that played the role. Arnie Hammer also, I knew he could act but he is awesome here as Ilya, and the exchange with Cavill is hilarious. I swear I almost fell of the chair laughing in ""The kiss"" scene, the rest of the theather as well.
I wasn't sold at first on Vikander, I thought that two hunks like the leads would be balanced by a stronger female lead, a more in your face one, but as I rewatched it, I'm convinced that exactly her more discreete presence balances the show off leads better.
As for the villain, well Elizabeth Debicky is simply delicious as Victoria Vinciguerra.
Another very awesome feature is some of the shots Ritchie pulls off that are absolutley breathtaking.
Again why this wasn't in the 6-700+ mil $ box office range is beyond me, the only thing I can think of would be a busy summer of blockbusters ...
I would love a sequed and a threequel for this but I know I'm probably hopping in vain as Cavill is busy with other projects, Guy Ritchie too, Alicia Vikander with the sequel to Tomb Raider, probably the only one with a less busy schedule would be Arnie Hammer.
But since hope springs eternal who knows maybe with the pandemics someone higher up the food chain in movie making read the reviews from the fans of this briliant spy comedy."
" Instant classic - Much better than expected
",0.4404,-0.743,2020-10-26 00:00:00,10,Love the style of the movie. Casting was perfect.Would love to see a sequel with the same main cast. But I fear Hollywood would manage to ruin it.
" Boring and never a thrill
",-0.5283,0.7629,2020-10-22 00:00:00,4,"Back in the sixties we had The man from U.N.C.L.E. as a TV-series, and that was fun to watch. But those were different times with a different frame of reference. Now we already have 007 for a long time and one of that kind is enough.
In this rehash the action is never exciting and the humour never funny. I was bored most of the time and I needed some breaks to see tit through."
" Can we make Them do a follower please!?!
",0.4374,0.9217,2020-10-12 00:00:00,10,"This is just such a good movie! Watched it about 4 times and still I return to see the overall realy good acting, the jokes and not at least amazing nostalgia of the 60s the clothes the colors and scenes ! Just.... Please , make one more! The man from U.N.C.LE 2 would be uplifting news in the other wise pretty wired year 2020..."
" BRILLIANT AND UNDERRATED
",0.5859,0.7202,2020-10-11 00:00:00,10,"Brilliant performances from Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, amazing music soundtrack.
I don't know why but you an watch it over and over again without getting bored."
" For the music alone it deserves a 9
",-0.25,0.9287,2020-10-07 00:00:00,9,"Oh the sixties. What style and music. This movie surprised me with great scenes and soundtrack. What great chemistry between Peril and the girl. The American tried just a tad too hard to imitate Bond but was nice to watch as well.
The story was not what makes this movie enjoyable, it's the whole atmosphere."
" Incredibly Funny
",0.4927,0.993,2020-10-06 00:00:00,8,"The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a throwback spy movie in the 60's/70's mold in a modern day jacket, inspired by the old TV series of the same name. It is highly successful in emulating the same tricks of film from that era, with extreme wide shots zooming in fast, collage action sequences and a great selection of groovy music that adds to the atmosphere tremendously. On the whole it's just a well made film, never skipping a beat.The plot is on the cliche side, but the dynamic of the two spies from Russia (Armie Hammer) and America (Henry Cavill) having to work together in the age of the Iron Curtain just works. Mix this in with a dame, excellently played by Alicia Vikander (who seems to be nailing every role given to her) and you have a great mix of characters rising above the expectantly clichéd spy soup.In the end though, it's Cavill that really gave this film the right edge. His comedic timing was absolutely brilliant. Making the film at times incredibly funny. Enjoy."
" Really good
",0.4927,0.8553,2020-10-04 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a really good movie. It has action, humor, and a great story line. The story brings you to several places."
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.6249,2020-10-01 00:00:00,10,"As time goes by,people will see it 4 what it is....a masterpiece"
" Diet Bond
",0.0,0.9638,2020-09-20 00:00:00,7,"Part spy-thriller, part buddy comedy, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. was basically Guy Ritchie and Henry Cavill's audition for the Bond gig. Cavill's Napoleon Solo was basically American James Bond and Ritchie's style of storytelling and editing lends itself well to a spy story.Like most of Ritchie's filmography, The Man From U.N.C.L.E was a stylist film fitted with a great cast and lots of twist. The film had a fantastic trio with Cavill, Hammer, and Vikander. Cavill does make a good case for himself to be the next Bond and it was fun to see Vikander let her hair down after some weighty roles in Testament of Youth and Ex Machina.Ritchie got that sense of '60s glamour and like the Bond series, there was international travel and the villain having a lair. The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was a breezy watch that humorous and some serious moments like Napoleon getting tortured."
" movie tries to be clever
",0.4588,0.834,2020-09-19 00:00:00,5,"A stereotypically witty American meets a stereotypically big and burly Russian as they team up in totally realistic mission where the two superpowers somehow decided to work together in the height of the cold war.
The one liners are mostly just simple jabs at each other's nationality, along with an underdeveloped love story between the Russian and the female. I say ""the female"" because as far as I'm concerned she spends the majority of the movie wearing nice clothes and looking pretty while being a plot device to bring the movie forward. Hey, it never hurts to have a hot, one-dimensional girl."
" Best movie I have watched so far
",0.6369,0.9891,2020-09-16 00:00:00,9,"The time I spent watching the movie was worth it. From the beginning until the finish, I was amused. The characters were good, Armie and Henry had excellent chemistry with each other, and Alicia Vikander's female lead.
The co-writer / director Guy Ritchie's film, adapted from the original product of the early 70s which combined imperious, nonsense, veteran Atlantic agent Napoleon Solo and younger Russian arrogant bowl cut Ilya Kuryakin in the cold war period. Suave and careless as a Solo, Henry Cavill enjoys his tailor-made image and temperament is a little less American. On the other hand, Hammer is more for Illya, met with rock and anger, his jaw put tightly with his hair, and an angry mark stuck to his widespread eyes. In an elevated yet relatively range series, the two spies battle for a source from East Germany called Gaby (Alicia Vikander). Her father is a nuclear scientist, her uncle a Nazi war criminal - she plays one of those entertainingly purposeful people who can repair the car engine, change into a clothes costume, and draw a confident path into life.
The movie was well constructed to portray the rivalry between the two most comprehensive spy agencies in the world, CIA and KGB. Napoleon Solo from the CIA, a former master thief, an expert in opening safes and lockers, and Ilya Kuriyakin, an agent of the KGB with a very short fuse and temper. Both of them were tasked to work alongside to locate and stop Gaby's father who was forced to work for a Nazi supporting family. Both the spies traveled to Italy along with Gaby to fulfill their mission.
The movie has a perfect mix of action and drama with a touch of the comedic feature. The characters Solo and Kuriyakin were portrayed perfectly and complementing each other. The scene after the two spies fled from the shipyard where Cavill aka Solo was seen picnicking within the truck while Hammer aka Kuriyakin was on the verge of death as he was drowning. There were several other moments of the two fightings like old couples throughout the movie.
While the main focus of the film was on the two male leads, the female lead character also played a crucial part in the film. The story-writing for the female lead was excellent. The character was shown as an independent female who can fix a car engine and drive it like the end of the world. Along with the skilled driving and strong mindset, the charm of the character can be seen very often in the film.
After reaching Italy, the trio immediately started working on their mission. The trust between the two spies can be seen at the very beginning of their journey; they both bugged each other to hear and track their every movement. Despite having different ideologies and being from the rival agencies, they started to cooperate well as the story unfolds. The role of the villain of Victoria Vinciguerra, played by Elizabeth Debicki was remarkable. She carried out her part quite well in the movie. She was seen as a strategist and aggressive Nazi supporter. She was planning to use Dr. Teller to build a nuclear weapon to give the Nazi elements.
A fun and transgressive film in general. Overall. On many occasions, when a complex storyline of acts is taking place, something unexpected happens in the foreground, much more boring yet entertaining. The action films and shows which were famous several years earlier contain plenty of observations and sensitivities The three leads develop quite interesting characteristics, making their experiences fascinating and convincing."
" It's alright, I guess.
",0.25,0.5574,2020-09-01 00:00:00,5,"Eh. It's a movie. Things happen in it. The funniest part is that they set up for a sequel right in the final scene, as if it was going to get one."
" very underrated
",0.0,0.836,2020-08-25 00:00:00,10,"Great film, rewatched it so many times. all of the actors were brilliant."
" Lots of style, little substance
",0.0,0.5808,2020-08-23 00:00:00,5,"So, Guy Ritchie wanted to make a classic spy movie in his own image. Unfortunately, it doesn't work that well. The styling and colour grading is quite authentic for the period, but the filming and editing is so flashy and edgy that it quickly gets annoying. The story is your typical spy thriller but never manages to get interesting or engaging. Much the same can be said about the characters: they are like models - empty shells meant to present a stylish product. The movie could have worked if the story and characters had any charm but, sadly, they don't. Not even a little. It's not bad as such, but it didn't feel as a worthy two hours of my time either."
" Glacial pace, dull action, bland characters
",-0.4019,0.9622,2020-08-23 00:00:00,3,"This is not a patch on the highly entertaining original TV series. The story unfolds with almost painful sluggishness, padded out with a lot of unnecessarily drawn-out scenes and pointless tangents, and could easily have been condensed into less than an hour of running time. The action is sparse and unexciting, the characters are generally flat and non-faceted, and the plot is as simplistic as it is asinine.The film-makers did do a very commendable job however of recreating an authentic sixties-style look in terms of costumes, settings and even women's make-up styles. They did very well in that regard, it was almost like watching a TV program from the time - which of course was the intent.The movie is mildly amusing in places, but it really needed a cast possessing greater comedic talents to pull it off. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer as Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin respectively are rather banal and lack animation - they are no Vaughn and McCallum. Elizabeth Debicki turns in a notable performance as the stylish femme fatale of the piece, and she has the perfect face for a sixties-era villainess. She looks like she came straight out of that period.Camera work is generally very good, except for a few split-screen sequences which are simply too distracting to be clever or engaging.Not a terrible film by any means, but not terribly great either. I couldn't sit through it a second time."
" Everything about this movie is classy - Kudos to Guy Ritchie
",0.7351,0.9886,2020-08-17 00:00:00,8,"Very familiar premise as far as espionage is concerned but still film stands out with some brilliant story telling by Guy Ritchie . Ritchie's film has some sort of subtleness, you'll see high tension scenes directed beautifully in a close calmly manner where sheer importance is been given to the one on one talks between the protagonist and the antagonist rather loaded with heavy violent scenes. He has some classy ways to get things done and that is his USP.
Elizabeth Debicki as main antagonist looks gorgeous, cunning & Bad Ass I actually loved her as the tall gorgeous villain. Armie Hammer is indeed a versatile actor every time I watch his movies he always has something new to offer and My God how tall he is like Henry Cavill was looking short Infront of him I mean the guy is our Superman :P nevertheless Cavill as Napoleon Solo is heart-throb he was Smart, Charming, Handsome basically everything a fictional spy can be. The love hate chemistry between Cavill & Hammer is something to look for. If you've not seen this movie yet I recommend you to watch it at your earliest."

And i extremely like badaas tough smart male main characters.Very nice Smooth introductionMid way through the film however things got a little bit complicatedHowever, its very hard for me find a perfect film. What prevented this film from getting a perfect score is simply
Gabby's betrayal.You get 2 spy's who are protecting you and work very hard to protect you. then you go and betrayed them. All the words that I want to describe this person with are not allowed by IMDb.kind of a cliffhanger?The ending is not 100% complete. It shows that there will be another mission worthy Russian and American have to cooperate again. It's acceptable to me but. Still not complete 100%Overall very very good film."

",0.6892,0.9905,2020-05-31 00:00:00,7,I saw a few clips of Man Of Uncle on Netflix and it looked quite good. So I watched it one evening with my mother. A good action comedy film. Was a little slow at beginning but got so much better throughout the film. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer have a really good partnership and acted the parts really well not mention there both are really good looking blokes lol. A good movie to watch with friends or family. Really enjoyed it
" An Amazing Spy Movie With Laughs
",0.7906,0.9902,2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,"I am not normally fond of Cavill but this production is one of his best works. It is funny, exciting and does not solely focus on one man. And maybe that is why it felt amazing after i finished it. I cannot say much about other actors/actresses much, since i don't know them. (I will from now on though.)Every character has their problems, there is rivalry, respect, love and every emotion you can think of. Normally this kinda movies would just focus on destruction and a womanizer man, but in this you can find both but on a behind the scenes doses.I just loved it and would suggest you to watch it, if you love spy comedies as myself."

Armie Hammer is so underrated, he even did some of his own actions and stunts, spectacular performance from him.Hope to see another part of it since Hugh Grant gave them codenames.

I liked the flow of the movie too but it had its style.going from one scene to another very quickly, some events are very fast It happens in the way I did not like it.
it would be better if it was in the style of James bond.
I think this is the reason why the movie makes a box office bomb, very fast, there is an unnecessary mess, not a bad movie, the average is watched."

" Fun Guy Ritchie 60's Spy Film
",0.5106,0.9944,2020-05-11 00:00:00,8,"Pros:
1. There is brilliant chemistry between Henry Cavill (Solo), Armie Hammer (Illya), and Alicia Vikander (Gaby). Especially between Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, whose back-and-forth is the highlight of this film.
2. The score and soundtrack are incredible and not only do they fit the 1950's/ 60's setting, but they really help to add a fun and zesty feel to the movie, particularly in the action sequences.
3. The costume and set design are fantastic and they blend perfectly into 1950's/ 60's Italy.
4. The cinematography is great, including a gorgeous vibrant colour palette, and sharp cuts and zoom-ins to inculcate a fast-paced and tense feel when needed.
5. Armie Hammer, Henry Cavill, Sylvester Groth (Uncle Rudi), and Elizabeth Debicki (Victoria) all give really good performances.
6. The action scenes were very entertaining to watch. It really did feel like a classic spy movie because of their choreography.
7. The comedy was hilarious, but it never felt overbearing or outstayed its welcome.Cons:
1. Henry Cavill's American accent, and Alicia Vikander's German accent, were distractingly bad.
2. There were a couple plot-holes, and plot conveniences. For example, Solo deciding not to shoot Illya in the beginning just because 'it didn't feel right'. In addition, at the end, how did Solo acquire the omnipotent disk from Victoria?"

" ""Carry On"" Fellini
",0.0,-0.9161,2020-05-03 00:00:00,6,"This could never be described as Guy Ritchie's best work, and Henry Cavill really is about as rigid as that jaw bone of his - but it does have redeeming features. It doesn't take itself at all seriously; there are loads of gadgets, stylish costumes and the even a soupçon of a score that could have been penned by Morricone. Set against a background of cold war mistrust, Illya Kuryakin (a comically thick-accented Armie Hammer) partners up with Cavill (""Napoleon Solo"") to prevent an evil Spectre-like organisation from proliferating nuclear weapons. Alicia Vikander and Elizabeth Debicki provide added glamour - and quite a bit of what menace this rather weak effort generates. I am not sure if it is intended (or not) to be a sort of ""Bond"" meets ""the Saint"" spoof - but it's tongue is firmly planted in it's cheek; there are quite a few decent comedic sequences and Hugh Grant manages to steal the few scenes he is in - as the enigmatic ""Waverly"". It obviously comes across way better than the original television series, but maybe that's the problem - it is all just a bit too classy and slick when it needed to be a bit more rudimentary."
" Serviceable, if Overhyped, Spy Film
",0.0,0.9964,2020-04-26 00:00:00,6,"I don't get the hype about this movie. I watched it, and it was alright. Pretty much what I was expecting it to be, with Ritchie's usual style, but with less action than I was hoping for.The performances are good across the board. Henry Cavill, the reason I watched this (I'm a fan) is great as the cool, cocky American spy, and Armie Hammer is every bit his equal as the tough British spy. Alicia Vikander is good too, as the vivacious, scheming sidekick.Guy Ritchie is definitely good. I really liked his Sherlock Holmes movies, and though I haven't seen his gangster movies that made him big, his skill is prevalent here, in the staging, cinematography, and structure.There are some cool action scenes, such as the opening chase, the bathroom fight, the factory shootout/boat chase, and the four-wheeler chase. The movie starts off well, but the pacing slowed to a crawl and it was kind of hard for me to stay interested. The action scenes are good though, and that four-wheeler chase was slick.I didn't really get the comedy. I understand it's subtle British humor, but the movie seemed full of anti-humor. It was like the comedy was comprised of intentionally awkward scenes and conversations. It feels very much like a Roger Moore Bond film, but less quirky and realized.Overall, I marginally recommend it to spy fans, and I guess action fans will be pleased if they set their expectations low, as this is not the all-out action fest that it may seem."

",0.2244,0.9897,2020-04-15 00:00:00,10,"Usually i tend not to get exited over movies, even realistic movies about topics i like racing.
And writing a revie? I think its my 1st/2nd time maybe..
But this one? WOW!
Its a solid 10/10 for me.
Even tho its from hollywood, there are no agenda pushers in this movie.
And its even treat both USA and russia (of the era) kinda objectively, which is rare in hollywood as far as i see..
And also- this movie creat better sexual tention then 90% of the 'undress me' scenes in other hollywood movies movies.
And how it createsnthat sexual tention? Without even taking a shirt of or a single inch of these 60s heavy clothes (if you wanna be more speific, there is a certain scene, which in my opinion is the best in the movie, that demonstrate what i wrote now+ its a funny scene).
Speaking of funny, the movie is also funny, yea it has action and tense but its not the 'mission impossible kinda action', its more like a ""by the way action"". Which is nice.
The music- pure geniousty!. The songs are great and puts you in the movie's mode.
All what i wrote above, such as the not over the top sexual scenes, not over the top violence, makes is also a movie you can see with kinda much anyone.
One this tho i kinda dislike- where, the, #### is the sequel?!?!?!"
" Supercool spy action and comedy, perfect direction, great performances, enjoyable to the core
",0.9217,0.9951,2020-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Wow, I have to say that "" The Man from U.N.C.L.E. "" is one of the best and coolest action- comedy movies of all times. The story is set in the y1960s, and the atmosphere, clothes, gadgets, and even the dialogues definitely have the 60s feel.It is very difficult to make a movie set in the 1960s so full of fun, but director Guy Ritchie has excelled in making this movie totally refreshing , exciting, and enjoyable; from the beginning till the end. I will rate this movie as Guy Ritchie 's best work ad a movie director.The actors have been correctly cast, and every actor in the movie has given commendable performances. The two main lead actors , Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, delivered perfect portrayals of an American spy and Russian spy. Alicia Vikander also shines as an undercover British spy. The on-screen chemistry between these 3 actors is outstanding.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a classic spy action- comedy set in the 1960s. I would like to take this opportunity to request a sequel to this movie with the same ensemble cast, please, Mr Guy Ritchie."

Everyone in this movie did a great job, and I'm really hoping there's a sequel. It's a big, corny, cheese fest, but that's to be expected since it takes place in the '60's. It's got a great, energetic score, and great writing. From car chases, to heists, to explosions, this film has everything! I was smiling and laughing throughout the entire movie. It's great fun, and highly recommended. Everyone in the movie has fun with it, and the only possible way you could not like this film, is if you were expecting a more serious spy thriller along the lines of ""Mission: Impossible.""

" A surprising spy movie
",0.2732,0.9207,2020-03-29 00:00:00,7,"This review contains spoilers.The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a spy movie that premiered in 2015. The movie is directed by Guy Ritchie and the story is written by Jeff Kleeman, David C. Wilson, Guy Ritchie, and Lionel Wigram. The movie stars Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, and Alicia Vikander. The movie is based on the television series that premiered in 1964. During the Cold War, an American spy and a Soviet spy must work together to overcome a plot by Nazi sympathizers to obtain a nuclear warhead.The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is a fun movie. Guy Ritchie has an energetic directing style that makes the movie incredibly exciting over the 116 minutes of running time. The direction is helped by the leading actors and actress of Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, and Alicia Vikander. These actors do a fantastic job as Napoleon Solo, Illya Kuryakin, and Gaby Teller. The characters have natural chemistry through their line delivery and performances. I enjoyed all of the scenes with these characters. In addition the villains of this movie have memorable lines. The movie has a nice progression into these scenes where the villains can deliver funny lines.The movie still does have its problems. The movie can drag in the middle where the two male leading characters of Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin build up their trust of one another. The movie felt predictable as the two characters needed to be provided scenes where the two of the characters have reasons to trust one another. In addition, the movie dragged in the last act when the set piece action scenes felt as if they were padding the length of the movie. The action scenes were not as interesting as the dialogue in the movie.I would recommend 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'Grade: B"

",0.0,0.9844,2020-01-20 00:00:00,9,"The most critical of the ""professional"" reviews lambasted this movie for NOT demonstrating a believable way to ""save the world"".I kind of wonder when movies were supposed to stop being about entertainment and started being relevant only when they carried a political message. If you're looking for a movie that glorifies veganism, feminism, or criticises capitalism or US foreign policy - this ain't it.What it IS is a beautifully made pastiche of the 60's constructed as an exciting and genuinely funny spy/action movie.The interplay between the three central characters is the key to making this movie work - as the Star Wars franchise showed, special effects and action are no substitute for real, engaging, human characters and a clever script. The rivalry between Solo (Cavill) and Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) is brilliant and Gaby Teller brilliantly stirs things further creating just the right amount of sexual tension to keep things interesting while steering clear of typical movie cliches. Hugh Grant's later appearance as Waverly is the icing on the cake.Meanwhile, the attention to detail in the settings is second to none, with the gorgeous soundtrack adding another dimension. Everything conspires to transport you back to this more innocent age.If you're dead set on expecting a Mission Impossible type of movie, then you may be disappointed - unlike M.I., The Man from U.N.C.L.E. doesn't take itself too seriously - the chase at the start being the first sign of that. In that regard it's very similar to Guy Ritchie's Sherlock movies, with hilarious moments, but never descending into slapstick or coarseness. Mixed in amongst the humour are some genuinely touching moments and plenty of high-octane thrills. You end up loving this team in a way that you never can with M.I.If you haven't seen it, give it a go - it may be the best spy film you'll ever watch."

The dirceting skills from mr Richtie comes to full in this unquie spyaction comedie. It's funny, corny , rapid dialoge and not a single dead frame. When mr Richtie has his moments and can work under his own terms, not with the restrictions from producers or company, he is the best at what he do with some exceptions like Quentin Tarantino.

The ability to pay homage to the spy tropes with a subtle wink and a twist.

" Another Bond beater
",0.0,0.9966,2019-09-05 00:00:00,7,"A Spy-Action movie? Well we should set our barometer to Bond then. Kingsman (one) laid a turd on the Bond franchise showing just what can be done. The Mission Impossible(s) have out tech-ed and out action-ed the Bond movies of late. Granted Guy Richie is dealing here with another vintage franchise in UNCLE but he could easily be recognising Bond as horrifically outdated and set him in his golden age of the 60's and the cold war, where he belongs.
Richie has embraced this scenario and wrung a lot of material out of it. He's brought back the suave and the luxury but it's not untouchable. There's an elegance and glamour to the female characters (Vikander Debicki) in this world but the ladies aren't melting so easily. They're opinionated and strong and largely two steps ahead of any male but not attention seeking, all the while being demure, but on their own terms.
Cavill (the American) is a bit more of a throw back Bond and Hammer (the Russian) is bit more Jason Bourne, a bit more action hero. Their interactions provide most of the interest and humour. Their constant one-upmanship is entertaining and almost a fraternal bickering which Vikander's character acknowledges asking ""does she have to play mother?"".
The plot pootles along quite well, providing motivation and little distraction. It's rather more dependant on script than the last Mission Impossible (Rating-NINE) which never gave you a moment to think, as it threw helicopters at you, and you allowed the outlandish twists. UNCLE also has twists but they're quite formulaic (surely that should be an oxymoron?) and prevents it being somewhat more intelligent.
A real success is the soundtrack, providing bag loads of effortless cool. Richie pours this on with split screens and 60's camera zooms. Strangely none of this convinces we're watching a movie set in the 60's. It feels current but set in variety of exclusive UBER-Hipster locations. The only reason you haven't seen an iPhone is because everyone is too post modern to use one. You half expect to see a Lamborghini Aventador being loaded up on the back of a vintage flatbed (in the background), because the locals feel it ""doesn't belong"". Even the spies are using clockwork instead of wireless because the want to do it ""old school"". I half expect that this is intentional and in effect achieves the same result of boosting the cool rating.
It's all amounts to a very watchable caper, with engaging characters and consider it a pity there doesn't seem to be a sequel in the offing (box-office?). It's a better bet for a decent franchise than Bond at the moment. SEVEN"
" A fun movie reboot of a classic TV series
",0.5106,0.987,2019-09-04 00:00:00,8,"This film is set in the early sixties and opens in East Berlin as CIA agent Napoleon Solo attempts to extract a German woman, Gaby Teller. Her father had worked for the Nazi missile programme before being taken to the United States; now he has gone missing and is presumed to be working for a group that will make atomic bombs for anybody who will pay them. A Soviet agent, Ilya Kuryakin, who is clearly highly skilled, tries to stop them but is ultimately unsuccessful. Shortly afterward, in West Berlin, the three of them are reunited and they are told that they will be working together in a joint US/USSR mission. Travelling to Rome, with Ilya posing as Gaby's fiancé and Napoleon posing as a thief they make contact with Gaby's uncle and attempt to find her father and infiltrate the criminal organisation.As a child I enjoyed watched repeats of the original TV show so was a little unsure about watching this new version. I needn't have worried. As it tells a story of Napoleon and Ilya's first mission together no prior knowledge of the characters is needed. The early scenes to a fine job of introducing the key characters and their mission. The action gets started early and continues throughout; it is exciting without being gory... in fact the style reminded me of early Bond films but with the level of humour turned up. The humour was unforced and didn't get in the way of the story. Everything about the film adds to the sixties feel without it becoming a pastiche. The cast is solid with Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer impressing as Napoleon and Ilya respectively and Alicia Vikander delighting as Gaby. Elizabeth Debicki also does a fine job as antagonist Victoria Vinciguerra. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of lighter '60s spy thrillers; it captures the feel and delivers laughs and excitement... along with a few good twists."
" to be avoided, with a great deal of energy
",0.5859,-0.9887,2019-08-28 00:00:00,1,"I never watched the old series, so I dove into the movie without preconceptions, hoping for some kind of comedic spy romp plus action movie. Unfortunately, I took against the movie with a passion.To begin with, ""The Man from"" desperately longs to be thought of as cool and stylish. However, all it does is show endless footage of handsome people wearing fashionable clothes against a backdrop of beautiful tourist spots. ""Cool"" and ""style"" spring from other things - things such as originality, boldness, wit and imagination. All of these are qualities ""The Man from"" is woefully devoid of, since it is pretty much a loose collection of ideas and tropes plucked from earlier movies. From this point of view, the viewer might just as well spend three hours in a dentist's office, leafing through glossy magazines and looking at advertisements for Italian perfumes.It does not help here that both protagonists are hugely unlikeable characters who, somehow, succeed in being male model-handsome and having what the French call ""une tête à claques"". This fine expression means ""having a face that invites, nay NEEDS slapping"".However, all of this is but small beer compared to the real problem with the movie, to wit that it shows so little empathy and respect for grievous sorrow. Just look at the way it trivializes the horrendous Nazi experiments during World War II. Completely innocent people, including children, pregnant women and grandmothers, were tortured and killed with the most atrocious cruelty. And here this idea of a Nazi torturer becomes part of a supposedly comedic interlude. Oooh, Nazis inflicting pain on screaming victims - just what one needs for a fresh, jolly spy romp !It is not just stunningly tone-deaf ; it is truly distasteful."

" The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Review
",0.0,0.9856,2019-04-07 00:00:00,8,"At the height of the Cold War, the CIA's Napoleon Solo (Cavill) and KGB's Ilya Kuryakin (Hammer) must work together against a fascist plot.
They say that if you can remember the 1960s, you weren't really there. Guy Ritchie (born 1968) presumably does not, but in his case that's an advantage. His imagined 1963 is impossibly cool and all that period glitz gives his U.N.C.L.E. an appeal of its own in a summer crowded with huge scale and bombastic action.
Functioning like a prequel to the classic Robert Vaughn-David McCallum TV series except with better-muscled stars, this film opens with a classic espionage trope: a CIA agent must rescue the family member of a kidnapped scientist from East Berlin. But when Henry Cavill's Napoleon Solo goes in to extract nuclear scientist's daughter Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), he comes up against the supernaturally determined Ilya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), whose mission is to secure her for the KGB. Their ensuing battle of brain, brawn, cars and wits is entirely delightful, and if the rest of the film had been on that level, this would be a classic.
Sadly, things get bogged down somewhat after the two team up to trace Gaby's father and prevent a neo-fascist group from building a nuclear weapon. Further action scenes are few and far between, which might be acceptable if they weren't also sometimes muddy in either objective or execution. The film relies instead on Solo's steady flow of witticisms, Kuryakin's well-timed grimaces and Gaby's defiance of both. Hammer's intensity plays perfectly against Cavill's insouciant, insolent style. Vikander is a fiery addition to the mix, not at all intimidated by either agent.
A thick vein of comedy runs the gamut from overly-familiar hotel farce to pleasantly subversive arguments about women's fashion. But the bad guys, led by Elizabeth Debicki's icy Victoria Vinciguerra, barely get a word in, and feel too abstract to pose a real threat. But, by the time Hugh Grant turns up to run rings around both leads, Ritchie and his cast have established a funny, bright world that feels quite unlike any of our other gritty, handheld spy franchises. Hopefully if U.N.C.L.E. returns, it will bring some structure to support its fizzy cool.
Cavill and Hammer are made for each other, but the film can't always find the pyrotechnics to match their chemistry."

" failed entertainment
",-0.128,0.9943,2019-03-01 00:00:00,4,"'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' had all the premises for a successful entertainment. It's an action and espionage film, a combination of genres that I like. The action takes place during the Cold War, a very interesting historical period for me, which has been the background of many successful books and films, and a pretext for the retro-espionage style that has created some successful comedies. The cast features Alicia Vikander, an actress who is as beautiful as she is talented. And yet, I have not managed to resonate or have fun with this movie. Whose fault was it? Maybe mine, though I have doubts that this is the reason.The film begins with a spectacular car chase in the Wall-divided Berlin in the 1960s, reminiscent of the style of 'Mission: Impossible '. We are dealing not with one super-spy but with two of them, who will continue their stunts in Rome, Italy, and on the Mediterranean shores. One is CIA, the other is KGB, and their bosses have decided that they have to work together to save the world, which does not prevent them from fighting with each other during the breaks. There is also an evil scientist of the Nazi era, plus one sadistic 'doctor of death'. The scientist also has a very beautiful daughter for whose charms the two spies will also exchange some other punches. As many spices as for a rich salad, but too many for one film.'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' is based on a television series of the 60s that was not, of course, broadcast in Romania where I was living at that time. I believe that if the retro line would have been followed more carefully, it would have had the chance to be a better movie. As it came out, director and co-writer Guy Ritchie seems to have tried to combine too many genres without succeeding in doing a good job in any of them. The action scenes are rather sloppy, except for the sea race close to the end of the film, where the split screens work very well. The spy intrigue a la Le Carre is confusing. The gags and comedy scenes rarely and with difficulty smash a smile. The romantic line is atrophied by the actors' flat play. Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, are forgettable super-spies. Neither for Alicia Vikander nor for Hugh Grant in a supporting role, 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' will be a film to remember in their careers. After all, if I think better, I do not believe that I am to blame for the missed entertainment."

This kind of nostalgia, please go to make literary and artistic films, so that the style can be coordinated."
" Great TV Show Adaptation
",0.6249,0.9586,2019-02-01 00:00:00,9,"I was a big fan of the old MAN FROM UNCLE TV series and for years heard rumors of a film in the making. When it finally went into production I was happy to hear that the talented Guy Ritchie was making it, though a bit apprehensive as he'd made a few bad films in the last few years, so I worried he might mess this up.He did not. He and the rest of the crew and cast absolutely knocked it out of the park. It's better than I ever could have hoped for. It's funny and tense and has that perfect tone. It is faithful to its source material while still doing its own thing. There are so many great scenes and the story is wonderful, as is the soundtrack. I only wish they'd hurry up and do a sequel already! But oh well, I guess they'll wait another ten years if they ever do one at all. Highly recommend."
" A Delightful and Tantalizingly Original Spy Movie
",0.7269,0.9966,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"15 August 2015. This movie almost defies description because of its very originality and the difficult exercise of finding any comparable spy movies of significance. This full-length movie version based on the 1960s television series and becomes a sort of prequel to the series and allows the film's director to re-vitalize the period of the 50s in a stylized retro look. What director Guy Richie has accomplished is a more ambitious fusion of witty humor and serious emotive drama than his Sherlock Holmes (2009) and its accompanying Game of Shadows (2011) helmed by the mega-star Robert Downey Jr. and his character sidekick well-known Jude Law. Through casting lesser known actors, Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, Richie relies more on the strength of success of his directing, the script, use of cinematography and accompanying music to bring out a wealth of comedy and appealing storyline in their performances.Some of the brilliance of this movie comes from one of a number of elements such as the heightened impact of music on the mood and energy of the movie reminiscent of Theodore Sharpiro's use of music in The Devil Wears Prada (2006) or Mark Isham in The Cooler (2003). Additionally, Ritchie has evolved the use of serio-comedy to a new level of achievement. Unlike the almost scientific precision and sophistication of Doug Liman's outstanding Bourne Identity (2002), Ritchie has opted for an earlier Cold War spy setting that focuses more on the intuitive and playfulness of the original bumbling Casino Royale (1967) with a strong infusion of Martin Campell's more serious drama of the 2006 version.Ritchie's casting of Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer resembles an duo performance of director Jonathan Lynn's casting of Bill Nighy in the witty Wild Target (2010) and Bill Nighy's more serious performance in the television movie Page Eight (2011). The Man From U.N.C.L.E. might derive some of its appeal in its ability toBlending the outlandish zaniness of the original Casino Royale (1967) with the serious, raw performance brought on by director Martin Campbell's contemporary 2006 film,capture the playfulness but in a more subtle way than that of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's in Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005),bringing out the stylized power yet less chaotic, frenzied nature of the hyper-active spy thriller of Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015),using the chemistry and humor with action of Jan de Bont's action blockbuster Speed (1994) yet allowing the characters themselves to promote the action instead of the blazing special effects and overdramatized impossible scenarios,portraying a more somber, realistic, and yes smarter than the entertaining and delightful Peter Segal movie version of the comedic spy television series Get Smart (2008),incorporating the intelligent dry wit and musings of Matt Damon's mental thoughts percolating in the crime comedy drama of The Informant! (2009)and evokes the same light-heartedness found in the more surreal and off beat assassin movie The Matador (2005) where Pierce Brosnan became one of the first actors to portray a new formula for witty espionage movies where director Richard Shepard was able to take a more established spy persona James Bond and change the standard movie rules of the spy game or even earlier John Cusack's Grosse Point Blank (1997).Ultimately, what makes this movie special is its ability to bring to the screen an amazing psychological twisting movie, mental amusement, all set on a lavish but believable spy canvass."

",0.4926,-0.8764,2018-11-26 00:00:00,6,"Having been a fan of the 60s TV series (particularly David McCallum), I had avoided seeing this remake (given my disappointments over ""True Grit"" and ""The Avengers""). But I listened to a recommendation and watched it last night. And far from a twinge of nostalgia (except perhaps for the subtlety of the TV Illya), I found myself actually looking forward to a sequel.
Guy Ritchie has managed to come up with a plot and script worthy of the legacy and with a tongue in cheek tone that makes the whole thing fun despite detracting from the suspense (let's be fair - how many people think James Bond or Jason Bourne might actually be killed or left too damaged to continue?).
We already know Henry Cavill and Alicia Vikander can carry a film and the former manages to portray the Napoleon Solo brashness and arrogance without being nauseating. Hugh Grant also provides an interesting new take on the Commander Waverley figure. The only shortfall is Illya Kuryakin - not through any failing of Armie Hammer, who portrays the part he was given and shows potential for a budding chemistry with Solo. But, at least for now, he is too much brawn and not enough brain (though Alicia's character managed to see something deeper, which might prove to be the trigger for a franchise, but possibly at the cost of losing her in the process - tragedy uniting the erstwhile enemies, perhaps)."

The film brings this out with juxtaposition as we watch Solo seduce women and drink wine while Illya is engaged in a life and death fight. While our threesome work together, they distrust each other and have their own agenda in addition to their main mission.In many ways this was like the new ""Fantastic Four"" where the intent of the film is to re-introduce the characters and officially name the group in the closing scene with the promise of a sequel. The dialogue was decent. The soundtrack at times was great and at other times loud and annoying. The film misuses radiation detection.

",-0.6696,-0.7828,2018-07-16 00:00:00,1,"I knew going in that this was going to be junky, but I had no idea the thoroughgoing awfulness in store. First, Henry Cavill is so devoid of charm and interest that the part would have been better played by a mannequin. If you thought he was bad as Superman/Clark Kent hang on to your hat. Then you have the story, which is paper-thin and nonsensical. That, in itself, doesn't doom a movie with lots of other things going for it, but when everything else is bad, a weak plot is just more wood on the bonfire. Then there's the style. Ritchie went for a quick cross-cutting between the Cavill action and the Armie Hammer/Alicia Vikander action, which did not work at all, again mostly because what they were up to was uninteresting. The oft-interrupted budding romance between Hammer and Vikander has no chemistry. Cavill's Bondesque nailing of the hotel front desk clerk and the ice queen villain are totally perfunctory. See what I said above about his lack of charm -- Never before has a male hero's sexual conquests been so obviously inserted to check off an item on a list of tropes, rather than growing naturally from the character. The unbelievable feats of daring-do pile up so fast and thick that you will be buried under a mountain of WTF moments, like Hammer in a car chase on foot. The torture scene is an extremely misjudged tone shift. Characters do things that have no point in the story and aren't explained in terms of character development -- like Vikander downing a bottle of booze. I could go on and on, but you get the point."
" Unexpectedly. Nuanced. Caper. Leads. to. Entertainment.
",0.4215,0.9984,2018-06-07 00:00:00,6,"3 out of 5 stars (average)The Man From U.N.C.L.E had a lot going against it for me. It was an August action-comedy with two actors with mixed resumes and a trailer that looked like it could be either a funny romp or a generic bore that a studio released because they could. However, my biggest worry was that the film was based on a TV show from the 60's that I hadn't heard of until I discovered the movie's existence. TV show adaptations often lead to very mixed results (See the Charlie's Angels movies for proof) that feel like studio cash-grabs on an old property with current stars in the main roles. Knowing this, I sat down in my theater, saw the title credits roll, and was greeted to a very fun, funny action romp that, while nowhere near a classic, will satisfy those looking for well-shot action and understated humor.The plot is simple: In the 1960's American spy Napoleon Solo (Man of Steel's Henry Cavill having a jolly good time) and KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer pulling off a great accent) must work together to find and destroy a nuclear warhead. They will do this with the help of the intelligent Gaby (Alicia Vikander of Ex Machina providing what may be the summer's best leading lady performance). However, the trio (or at least the guys in it) must contend with the villainess Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki) on their mission to prevent nuclear disaster, as well as letting their own prejudices kill each other.I was surprised by this film. Director Guy Ritchie (most famous for the Sherlock Holmes flicks and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels) crafts well-shot action sequences that are fun to watch and never go on too long. Ritchie has a knack for action, using slow-motion effectively so that you can see everything, but knowing when to pull back and let everything go crazy at appropriate times.However, the action isn't the main attraction here. That honor goes to shockingly good character chemistry and understated comedy. I thought that the pairing of Cavill and Hammer was an odd one, as neither had proven their might as comedic leads yet. Imagine my glee as the two worked off of each other in the same way that pinballs bounced in a pinball machine. Their delivery is nearly perfect, and their verbal fights are fun to the ears. I would like to see these two work together again, as they are an unexpectedly well-matched duo.Alicia Vikander also pulls a hat trick, being the most useful and intelligent female lead I've seen this year. She is not there for the male demographic to stare at (but they can anyway). Vikander has a presence onscreen that will hopefully give her a long career.I was quite sad to see that our theater consisted mainly of middle-aged individuals. I'm not trying to ageist, but I find it odd that a movie starring heartthrob Henry Cavill and hottie Alicia Vikander would have an audience completely free of hormonally-charged teenagers. I'm not saying that the middle-aged are hormonally dead, but I think the casting of these individuals was a ploy to get members of my generation to come into the theater, not theirs. Hopefully, this will not be like Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, a Chris Pine vehicle based on a famous literary character from the 90's in which 50-year-olds made up half of its opening weekend. This movie will please my generation: it has humor, action, and hot guys. What more could you want at 20?The last item of mention is the comedy. This film could go into a few different genres: Buddy film, Spy action, and Comedy. The movie immediately has a light tone that lets you know that it's going to be a fun ride. The humor ranges from innuendo to flat-out wit, made all the funnier by the actor's chemistry mentioned above. The bottom line is this: If you want to laugh, then this flick should satisfy your needs.The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is a fun, suave spy caper with great chemistry, humor, and memorable action. It's a great film for those who want to kick back, relax, and see Henry Cavill prove he can do something other than brood in the Supes costume.Rated PG-13 for Action Violence, Suggestive Content, and Partial Nudity"
" Say Uncle - Ok I give up, Uncle!
",0.3595,0.926,2018-06-06 00:00:00,2,"Clearly an origin movie hoping to turn into a franchise, but failing to hit the target on almost evey level.
Supposedly a riff on ""The Man From UNCLE"" TV series, yet the first thing they do is change the Napoleon Solo character into Alexander Munday from ""It Takes A Thief"" (played by Robert Wagner in that series)
Solo becomes a master thief who is forced to work for the CIA to avoid encarceration.
Guy Richie, instead of directing in his familiar ""Lock, Stock and Sherlock Holmes"" style, tries to be something he's not, trading empty stylishness for emotional impact.
Poorly constructed action scenes, where the style and humour are allowed to undermine excitement and suspence.
Other scenes which are revisited and explained in flash back, in order to help the audience understand what happened previously, indicating either that the director thinks the audience are stupid, or that he didn't do a very good job in the first place.
That's not to say there are not occasional good lines and nice touches sprinkled amongst the blandness, but not enough to balance the books.
Meanwhile Henry Cavil is mannequin level bad. As stiff as a board in a role that requires natural charm rather than acting.
Was he told to play it that way or did he decide himself? Either way, in this, he is a charisma free zone.
Armie Hammer is slightly better, but also lacking in the charisma necessary to succeed in this type of role.
On the other hand Alicia Vikander is far too openly emotional to make a credible German, perhaps she was just trying to make up for the other two?
Hugh Grant, of all people, shows them how it's done, when he turns up as Waverly.
Also half of the music doesn't fit the film well either, American Soul and Jump, which does not serve to enhance the European flavour of the setting.
However the passing of time dims the memory and apparently there may be a sequel... Oh the Humanity!!!"

Hugh Grant is looking older but his voice is still cooly British. What can one say about Alicia Vikander, she goes from strength to strength. She looks gorgeous in 1960s fashion and, as ever, her speaking voice is captivating. I vaguely remember watching the television series with Robert Vaughn and David McCallum and this film is faithful to their dead-pan humour. I was amused at times by the Italian but that's only because I speak the language, really it was fine. Ignore any and all comments regarding Elizabeth Debicki's Italian, it's absolutely fine. I also liked the attention to detail, Rome looked just like 1960s Rome. The film works, I hope they make a sequel."

The actors that were chosen do a great job at working with what they are given, which helps elevate the movie slightly.

However, i should have guessed that it had roots in the past, since the plot actually made sense and it had some style.On top of everything, Guy Ritchie's directed, which could have made the whole project take a turn for the predictable British-gansta style. Luckily, that did not happen.Cavill and Hammer plays two spies from the opposite side of the Iron curtain, forced to work together. An attractive woman is thrown in for good measure, but rather tastefully (not in the James Bond-disposable style). Vikander is Gaby Teller a German who has some secrets of her own.Elizabeth Debicki, who was quite effective in the mini series ""The night manager"" appears as an Audrey Hepburn-lookalike and one of the villains of the story.Really enjoyable."

",-0.25,-0.9622,2018-03-13 00:00:00,3,"THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. is another dud from British director Guy Ritchie, who has been churning out one poor-quality film after another for the last twenty years after he did so well with LOCK, STOCK and SNATCH. This is supposedly a new version of the classic 1960s television series but aside from the character names it has no relation to that show. Instead, this is a very poorly-made Cold War thriller in which a US spy and a Russian spy have to team up to tackle a terrorist bomb threat. This is one of those films that has absolutely no idea what it's meant to be. It's not funny at all, and both Cavill and Hammer are stiff and awkward in their roles. There's little in the way of interesting action sequences and in between the 'moving' scenes the pace slows down to a real crawl. Don't expect one single moment of suspense or anything associated with suspense or normal thriller film elements. It says something when an extended Hugh Grant cameo is the most interesting thing in the whole picture. As is usual for the actress, Alicia Vikander is cast in a femme fatale role but comes across as a child playing dress up."

" Genuinely fun, classic spy romp
",0.5106,0.9879,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' is a 60s spy film, based on a 60s cold-war-era TV show, and it is great! While spy movies might be overdone this year ('Mission: Impossible' 5 just came out, 'Spectre' is out in three months and 'Kingsman' is similar), there's always room for fun, classy, well-made films - and Ritchie's eighth film is up there with 'Snatch', in my opinion. It's certainly as good as, if not better, than the two 'Sherlock Holmes' films.UNCLE stands for ""United Network Command for Law and Enforcement"", although you don't see this until the final credits - it's just another lame acronym, a la SHIELD. The film keeps lots of it's 60s elements - the cars, clothes, editing/split screens, the cool yellow/bold subtitles when required and the fantastic score/soundtrack. The story is simple - a KGB agent (Hammer) and a CIA agent (Cavill - Superman himself) are forced to work together with a German (Vikander) to find the bad guys who are making their own nuclear weapons. It's funny that Cavill is British, playing an American; Hammer is American, playing a Russian; and Vikander is Swedish, playing a German.The film doesn't mess around, and while it goes for almost two hours, it is very well paced, with never too much downtime - there's a car chase in the first 5min, boat chases, plenty of fight scenes and always a joke or funny quip not far away, as the American and Russian take turns to emasculate each other. The chemistry between the three leads is great and makes the film - aided by the Italian scenery - as the film draws you in expertly and has a very satisfying ending. I hope there's more!"

" The Men From AWFUL
",-0.5766,-0.9278,2017-09-30 00:00:00,1,"The Man From Uncle (TMFU) Remake: What IS it? Ugh. Ptooie. don't bother.It is awful. It is another movie branded as TMFU but is NOT. And its not even that good a stand alone movie even if you knew it's not what you wanted! This thing is NOT a remake of what we enjoyed as teenagers, it displaces the period to the Cold War. Casting is terrible, Solo and Kuryakin are wrong, played stiffly, badly, with no sense of levity. The Man From Uncle's themes were not Cold War themes except vaguely. The original was much more tongue in cheek, satirical, and the bad guys were Thrush, more like Spectre. TMFU was nonpolitical and fun. This just stinks. Thrush stood for The Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity. like the victors say Nazis are said to have been, I guess. The casting on this one could not have been more wrong. The mood, setting, feeling, was all wrong. It was like it was based entirely on another concept and just relabeled as The Man From Uncle.BAD. Neither of the main characters had any of the charm or style the originals had,even on the limited budget that the original MFU had. It depended on strong characterization and a sense of fun. This thing has NONE of that other than being passably OK with period sets and some of its costuming. It copies the original's yellow with blue outlined subtitles in the same fonts and colors, but uses them badly. They were not done well and vanish into the background. Being hard of hearing I notice this. The music is not even derivative or familiar of Jerry Goldsmith's theme. It runs more like an Italian knock off of old spy movies and is nowhere near as fun. I could not bear to finish it and turned it off. My score on the Man From Uncle, remake: -10. A piece of crap. And it wasn't just me-- it was a box office failure and for good reason."
" what happened Guy?
",0.0,0.9841,2017-09-27 00:00:00,3,"...in most cases I do not waste time reviewing Hollywood movies; even older ones, because there s enough good reviewers and with those opinions you just have pretty all covered; so is only to contribute with the other members trying to state clearly that the 7.6 in the ranking that you see, is too much for this very movie.Saying that, regarding the movie itself, is very precise what another commentator is saying about the main characters that ""were updated from what was allowable in 60s television to satisfying and engaging modern versions of their original incarnations..."" this is key for big Hollywood productions; if not how do you compete with those fast and furious et all?-The acting is bad, too ""static"" without chemistry between the characters. 6os original series has comedy and s special humor; well you do not have any of that here. Also half of the time is just pointless with useless scenes, scenes that do not contribute anything to the plot; by the way which one? You can add that there are more than one fail in the story.About the good things: The colors are very good, may be not top quality like with Tarantinos movies. It has several very good shots with good photography and couple of tweaks here and there as you expect with a movie directed by G R.The attention to the details in the wardrobe, make up, vehicles, etc is remarkable but is not so much to save the final product.Not only pretty faces is needed, sometimes a bit of charm and style is OK too; ahh, acting too."
" A Complete and Satisfying Surprise
",0.6249,0.9986,2017-09-22 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie with no expectations save: ""Ah, another spy movie. I guess some dudes are gonna sneak around and shoot at people."" What I got was such a surprise, I could only stare at the screen in shock when the credits rolled.First of all, this is a gorgeous film. We're treated to painstakingly-composed shots, creative camera angles, choosy lighting, and evocative, colorful scenery that's full of life right from go. The look and feel of the early '60's is brought to the fore, and it is magnificent with just a touch of quirky. The costuming is truly something to behold, from funky frocks to luscious robes to cool combat gear. Even the editing is a work of art in and of itself, with creative but logical cuts that keep your attention and maintain a springy, fun pace to the movie.Secondly, this movie is nothing like my previous experiences with ""spy"" films (James Bond, Mission Impossible, the Bourne series, etc.), and everything I had always hoped such a movie would be. It is SO funny, rarely taking itself too seriously, but when it does, you're on the edge of your seat and feeling for those characters. The mix of pure comedy, dark humor, and seriousness is very much a trademark of Guy Ritchie, and it works fabulously here. Even the acting doesn't take itself too seriously - Cavill in particular hams up his character just the perfect amount to be evocative of the 1960's TV show from whence this film sprung. Hammer's character is magnetic - deadly serious, but so dork-tastic it makes him excellently human. It's hard to put a finger on Vikander's character, but it turns out that this is for a good reason, and she is fun and interesting nonetheless. I loved that the focus was spread pretty evenly between the three lovable characters, making it feel much more like an ensemble cast rather than the focus and development all happening to just one character or two.The fight scenes are relatively few, surprisingly, but exciting and real-looking. I was concerned at first at how quickly the romance was introduced to the story, until I realized that it was going to be a long, teasing, torturous game, which I found compelling and satisfying.In essence, I was swept away by this film, thoroughly enjoying every minute, loving the cool music, the pace, the visuals, and the simple story thoroughly enriched by fabulously entertaining and surprisingly mysterious, nuanced characters. It is certainly not without its flaws, but for such an unassuming film to surpass my expectations and pleasantly surprise me to such a degree, it absolutely deserves a 10/10, as well as a sequel. A franchise, even, as a period piece that throws together an American, a Soviet Russian, and an East German in a period where they should not have ever been colleagues, much less friends. This movie is everything the spy genre should be, and I would recommend it to anyone."
" ""How's that for entertainment?""
",0.0,0.9907,2017-09-10 00:00:00,8,"This is a nice, fun movie absolutely worth seeing. It got good reviews from both audience and critics and I think it deserved to do better at the box office than it did. The original U.N.C.L.E. series (1964+) -- which I watched as a kid -- at the time was the sensation of the TV world. We all knew what the initials stood for and what the latest episodes were about. The show was one of several attempts to capitalize on the success of the early Bond films (others including e.g. I Spy, To Catch a Thief) and was quickly spoofed in turn by the absurdist Get Smart (1965) (the lines from which also became watchwords around school). Unfortunately, the TV UNCLE starring Robert Vaughn and David McCallum changed from a semi-serious -- and good -- show in its first couple of seasons into broad self-parody in its later years and just lost steam. To read more about that I recommend Vaughn's interesting autobiography ""A Fortunate Life"" (sadly Vaughn died just last year).This new movie is a great look back into that era of history. However, unlike the 2008 movie recreation of Get Smart, it doesn't try to copy anything much from the original show except the Cold War ambiance of the 1960's. As the movie begins, U.N.C.L.E. as an agency doesn't even exist. Instead our two favorite agents, Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) are forced by their respective bosses (CIA, KGB) to work together to track down a rogue Nazi weapons scientist and nuclear bomb (or something. The initial layout of the mission is complex, zooms by quickly, and doesn't really matter anyway. It's the process that counts.). The two of them spend most of the film edging around each other, finally though grudgingly arriving at a solid working partnership by the end. Alicia Vikander and Elizabeth Debicki figure prominently as their partner Gaby and chief villain Victoria respectively; they get to show off lots of striking 1960's clothing. In the second half, the always-reliable Hugh Grant makes his appearance as an affably overbearing Alexander Waverley, the man behind the curtain who's been pulling all their strings. At the end, it's clear that Napoleon, Illya, and Gaby have been formed into a new team with the new code name UNCLE and already given their next mission. They don't look entirely happy about it.Cavill's version of Napoleon Solo is an even more extreme suave, icy-cool version than Vaughn's, but Hammer's hulking, physical version of Illya Kuryakin is nothing like David McCallum's. There's lots of good action interwoven expertly with ironic humor. At one point, Solo (realizing his drink has been drugged), settles himself down flat on a couch, explaining to Victoria that ""the last time, I hit my head"". An earlier chase scene with two speedboats and an old truck is delightfully original. And there's a horrible but hilarious setup of black humor when the irredemeedably evil Nazi accidentally burns himself up while Napoleon and Illya are in the next room discussing what to do with him. The plot finishes up with another bit of black humor when Solo keeps Victoria talking on the radio long enough for her escape boat to be tracked down and elegantly sunk (His dry signoff ""How's that for entertainment?"" has got to be one of the better taglines ever used.) Clever and stylish direction by Guy Ritchie, for a movie where style is quite a bit more important than substance. His occasional use of multiple split-screens is another look back at the '60's and in one case is an extremely effective way to get through a lot of action (the covert invasion of the bad guys' island) very efficiently without taking away screen time from our favorite characters. (That sequence slyly finishes up as the splits showing Napoleon and Illya dissolve when they've arrived at the same place.) If you missed it in the theaters, it's definitely worth catching on Netflix now. Sadly this doesn't look like it will lead to any sequels."
" Declines a bit, but overall still a solid watch
",0.2263,0.9984,2017-08-13 00:00:00,6,"""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" is a British/American co-production in the English language mostly, but due to the Cold War subject, other languages are included too, so a good set of subtitles may help. The director and one of the writers of this movie is Guy Ritchie and the film is closely connected to the 1960s television series. I must admit I haven't seen a single episode from this show (yet?), so I cannot talk about parallels and differences, but I somehow feel it would have been nice had they included Vaughn and/or McCallum in this 120-minute movie as a cameo somehow. Both actors were still performing in their 80s at that point, but well a bit of a pity they did not try or manage to convince them. Anyway, we have Armie Hammer and Henry Cavill in here and both are options to follow Daniel Craig as Bond and especially Cavill really had an aura of MI6 in here on many many occasions. In terms of looks, acting and the way the character was written you can almost call it an application. Hammer was decent too and I still think he is among the best from his age group of actors around the age of 30 currently. The biggest female part was played by Alicia Vikander the very same year she gave her Oscar winning supporting(?) performance. I kinda like her (how could you not) but there was something about her Gaby character that didn't feel right at all. They obviously did not want to waste Vikander's talent, but the way the character was written, also with the final plot twist, just didn't work out. It's tough to put a finger on it. As for Hugh Grant, he rose in recent years for me in how I perceive his talent/performances, especially in Florence Foster Jenkins and I am not sure what to think of him here. His character may be crucial eventually, but he also feels a bit wasted.The film also includes the likes of Groth and Berkel and as I am from Germany I was slightly surprised to see them in a Hollywood blockbuster like this one here. But I was sure positively surprised with Groth especially who could have been an amazing main antagonist instead of Debicki as she never fulfilled this role convincingly sadly, which also had to do with the way the character was written. It just did not make sense to me she could fool a super agent like Solo that easily. She also faded next to Vikander, which certainly is not a shame at all these days. So yeah, the antagonist side was definitely not the film's best and also kept it from being on par with Bond films, the better ones at least. In the second half, the film also lost itself a bit in action sequences unfortunately, gets generally a bit worse overall. The introduction to the characters and presentation of the mission were eventually maybe better than the mission itself. It could/should have ended after 105 minutes maybe. But it's not a bad film by any means, has a really good moment here and there at times and Cavill and Hammer have good chemistry as well. The ending implied a possible sequel and I would watch it I guess. All in all, the positive is more frequent than the negative and I would say it is more of a crime drama/adventure with some thriller moments than really a comedy, even if here and there the film will put a smile on your lips too, like the CO2 laser scene. Worth checking out as a whole. I give it a thumbs-up, even if it is of course never best-of-the-year material."
" Imagine: Superman working as an undercover spy for the US government at the height of the cold war. . .
",-0.5994,0.9847,2017-05-19 00:00:00,9,"Superman Henry Cavill, the elegant Englishman stars as an American con man/thief-turned government spy at the height of the cold war in the early 60s. In the opening scenes, he's assigned to a mission that will send him behind the iron curtain to rescue a German mechanic (Alicia Vikander). Along the way, he dukes it out with a Russian spy played by the exquisitely named Armie Hammer. Shortly after that, Cavill and Hammer are assigned to work together, escorting Vikander to Italy in the hopes of infiltrating the evil criminal empire led by the beautiful Elizabeth Debicki. She's got a plot to sell a nuke (that was built by Vikander's estranged father who was kidnapped for the dastardly cause) to ex-Nazis. To be honest, it doesn't make much sense; it's one of those blockbuster plots that is simultaneously too simplistic and too convoluted. Not that the story matters much, anyway. As always, Ritchie's plots are really just a clothesline for him to hang images, sequences, and colourful characters on, and he's got plenty of those kicking around this time.More than anything else, the movie drips with 60s cool. Everyone is decked out in delightful period costumes, from the men's well- trimmed suits, to Vikander's kooky mod outfits and shades. They all look great and they've been plopped into globetrotting locations fitted with retro cars, furnishings, and amusingly clunky spy technology. Toss in a soundtrack filled with delightful underplayed 60s pop and a score inspired by those very sounds, and you've got a feast for the senses. Even if you aren't as fond of the era as Ritchie and his designers clearly are, there's no denying that the movie looks gorgeous and distinctly old-time-y. Even the cinematography boasts a parade of vibrant colours mimicking the old film stock of the period. It's a gorgeous little time capsule populated by equally gorgeous people.The 90s were filled with feature film adaptations of old 60s TV shows, most of which weren't very good, and one of which is still around in Mission: Impossible. Throughout that decade and ever since, the old Robert Wagner series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. has been chatted up as potential blockbuster fodder. After years of failed attempts by such filmmakers as Steven Soderbergh, co-writer/director Guy Ritchie finally got the movie onto screens this summer. If you haven't heard of the series or can barely remember it, don't worry; aside from your grandparents, no one's particularly fond of the show, and even they barely remember it. It was a merely light spy romp and really, that's all that seems to have attracted Richie to the project, other than the 60s setting. Much like his former filmmaking partner Matthew Vaughn did in the downright excellent The Kingsman earlier that year, Richie's goal was to bring back the tone of the old rollicking Bond movies in an age when all spy flicks are required to be gritty and sombre. Ritchie's take on that old chestnut lacks that bat-s*it comic book insanity of Kingsman, but makes up for it by doubling-down on retro cool. It's fairly not Locked, Stocked or has Two Smocking Barrels in it though, for a wisp of a movie, it is indeed an undeniably fun one if you enjoy all the retro references. The wispy charms of the movie will likely be lost on anyone who doesn't know or appreciate the brand of old-time-y espionage escapism that Ritchie is referencing, which is a shame because that'll cut the audience down to cultists. However, for those who do get a kick out of the goofball goof-off the director served up, there's no denying that it's Richie's funniest and most entertaining movie since Snatch."
" Well worth the 1hr 56 minutes I spent in the theater
",0.4588,0.9928,2017-05-14 00:00:00,9,"This movie was well worth the 1hr 56 minutes I spent in the theater. I was completely entertained from the opening till the end. The characters were very likable, Armie and Henry had great chemistry, with each other and with the female lead played by Alicia Vikander. I loved the snappy exchange between both actors, each had classic lines which worked with their character's personalities. The action kept me on my toes, the car chases were done with vintage cars which was nice to see.Obviously, the cars were from the '60s to correspond with the movie's time-line, as were the fashion worn by both ladies; funky earrings and eyelashes for days. Despite the time line in the movie, the women were portrayed in a very dominant role, at times upstaging the men, but not in a bad way. I loved the comedic element of the movie and so did the audience that sat in the nearly half empty theater. One of the lines that had us laughing was when Henry's character described Armie's character as barely human, he referred to him as ""it"" saying things like you should have seen ""it run,"" and ""it ripped off the trunk of a car."" While Henry delivered his comedic lines with swoon-worthy swagger, Armie did a very good Russian accent, with little quirks like a horrible but non-threatening temper.I loved everything thing about this movie, the way it was shot, the tone, the story line, everything. I hope they continue the franchise there is still so much about these guys and girl that I want to learn more about."

It takes the bond formula and recreates it through Guy Richie's unmistakable lens.I honestly think Napoleon Solo (one of the main characters, an American Spy) was a perfect role for Henry Cavill, who knocked it out of the park... an Archer-esque, suave, witty charmer/womanizer. The same can be said of Armie Hammer and Alicia Vikander's charactersThis is a witty, lighthearted, and funny movie and seriously underrated. It is definitely a go-to relax and enjoy movie for me"
" ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" brings back characteristics of old spy movies
",0.0,0.9692,2017-04-11 00:00:00,7,"In the midst of the dark and gritty movies that have characterized the 2000s, it's nice to see Superman and the Lone Ranger team up for a 1960s spy throwback.Napolean Solo (Henry Cavill) is a suave, carefree thief turned spy, tasked with extracting Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) from East Berlin for the CIA. During the escape, Solo and Teller evade KGB agent Illya Kuryakin and report back to Solo's superiors, only to find out that the KGB and CIA have reluctantly teamed up. Solo and Kuryakin are forced to work together to stop a wealthy couple from using Teller's father to build their own nuclear weapon.""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" brings nothing new to the table in terms of its structure. Two good guys with conflicting personalities are forced to work together to take down the bad guys. Add in some classic spy elements and a pinch of action, and you've got yourself a nice summer blockbuster.Guy Ritchie's stylistic direction coupled with Cavill and Hammer's on screen chemistry make up for the film's lack of substance. Referring to each other as 'cowboy,' and 'The Red Peril,' the two leads humorously characterize the stereotypical depiction of 1960s American and Russian spies. Hammer's subdued, hardened persona compliments the James Bond-like charm of Cavill. Vikander delivers a solid performance as well. There's more to her character than meets the eye. Delicate yet strong-willed, she adds a nice dynamic to the trio.While the plot is one of the film's weaker aspects, Ritchie executes the few twists and turns it takes well, even if some of them are predictable. He does this primarily through showing small parts of a scene, leading you to think that a situation plays out one way, when it actually played out much differently, revealed later when the entire scene is shown. Ritchie uses this technique a few times in the movie, and while this may become tiresome for some viewers, I thought it was interesting, and it kept me on my toes throughout the film's runtime.""The Man from U.N.C.L.E"" hearkens back to the beats of older spy movies. The characters do not take themselves too seriously. Solo causes women to swoon left and right as he cracks jokes about Kuryakin's Russian traits. Teller slowly breaks down Kuryakin's hard demeanor, and he manages to crack a few jokes of his own. The opening action scene matches this tone and sets the stage for a perfect action throwback.As the story progresses however, there are moments where the film takes itself too seriously and the action is filmed differently to appeal to a modern audience. These infrequent tone shifts clash with the overall feel the movie is trying to convey, and this detracted from my enjoyment of the film. That being said, Ritchie does know how to create tension during the more serious moments, and transfers the emotions his characters are feeling to the viewer, primarily those of Kuryakin. In one particular scene, the feeling of betrayal is evident in the dimly lit close-ups of his face. The ominous ringing of church bells paired with silent shots of him tearing up a room out of rage is unsettling and conveys the anger of Kuryakin effectively to the audience.""The Man from U.N.C.L.E"" is not an Oscar contender. It is not the next cinematic masterpiece that you should rush out to see. The film serves its purpose as a sleek and fun action movie, and I had a blast watching it."
" Pure Entertainment
",0.4215,-0.0801,2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,"I really don't know why this film didn't do a lot better. This is a film that has style and character in abundance. The plot is nothing clever but it does work (which can't be said for a lot of stories in action films). Where this film really scores points is with the 3 main characters and how they interact with each other. When I was watching this I couldn't help thinking that this is what is so lacking in modern James Bond films, which have become generic action flicks. Napoleon Solo does Bond better than Bond! a character with real style and both attractive and floored qualities. Indeed this is why all the characters work so well they all have strengths and weaknesses which makes them work as a team. We also have the rare inclusion of a female antagonist whose just plain bad without any excuse being given for her behaviour.In short this film is bags of entertainment and enjoyment and is a worthwhile way to spend an evening, and you can't say much better than that."
" In Search of Nuclear Technology
",0.0,-0.5461,2017-03-23 00:00:00,6,"This movie essentially takes place in the early 60's with the United States and the Soviet Union essentially locked in a Cold War which has bred a great deal of mistrust between the two of them. As it so happens, ""Napolean Solo"" (Henry Cavill) has been apprehended for a number of thefts and because of his unique skills is forced to work for the C.I.A. in lieu of going to prison. That being said, one particular mission involves coercing a female named ""Gaby"" (Alicia Vikander) into escaping from East Germany in order to help them locate-and subsequently infiltrate-an organization which has her father working on a new type of nuclear device which would revolutionize the military capabilities for whichever side had it. Needless to say, the Soviet Union is also interested in this technology and for that reason they send a special agent named ""Illya Kuriakin"" (Armie Hammer) to prevent her escape and kill Napolean Solo in the process. However, things don't turn out as planned and because of that Napolean Solo, Illya Kuriakin and Gaby are soon forced to work with each other due to mutual necessity to stop this terrorist organization from using the nuclear bombs it has produced upon the world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent spy movie which was largely based on the television series by the same name over 50 years ago. Admittedly, there were a few changes made involving the main characters which I don't believe were necessarily for the better. Likewise, I also believe it didn't quite capture the feel of the specific time-period in question as well as it could have. Be that as it may, this film was still entertaining enough and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."
" Excellent - a cool and funny spy movie
",0.836,0.9386,2017-03-23 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie that I have probably seen 15 times since I bought it on iTunes. I love it. It is one of those movies that you can over and over again. The humor is excellent and on point, showing the rivalry of the two spies that are forced to work together. Initially I was not sure why I bought it, it just looked very fun and interesting without any ""over the top"" reviews. I don't regret it one bit.. it was worth it! As a comedic spy movie, with smarts and fun, bringing together a not way too original story or surprises, it still manages to entertain in a way that I have not been entertained in years! I recommend everyone to see this if you haven't. It requires some attention to jokes and details to fully understand everything and laugh, but it is also a movie you can sit down with and forget that there is a world outside."
" Don't get the fuss
",0.0,0.9766,2017-03-20 00:00:00,5,"To be fair, I never watched the original Man from U.N.C.L.E. TV show, but this remake doesn't really make a great case for it both in terms of quality or content. The film stars Henry Cavill as Napoleon Solo, a foppish American who must work with the plebian KGB operative Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), and the German Gabby Teller (Alicia Vikander) to find the location of Teller's father who may be building a bomb for Nazi sympathizers. Directed by Guy Ritchie the entire film is a gorgeous genre exercise, but after awhile that's all it begins to feel like: exercise. The problem is the three leads. I'm not a particular fan of any of them, but they all come across as so wooden and strangely free of chemistry, a big no-no for a movie that is obviously trying to make a case that all three of these gorgeous people have sexual tension with one another (they really, really don't). Vikander and Hammer also feel so replaceable, like you could slap any other gorgeous white twenty-something into their roles and have a similar (or better!) effect. Only Henry Cavill really nails his character and he has some truly great scenes where I actually laughed. The rest of the time I could practically see each carefully scripted laugh, innuendo and moment of sexual tension but each time I felt empty. Another problem is the film is so obviously trying to set itself up as the first in an instalment. The movie crashed and burned on arrival at the box office so we're done with the series, or at least the series with these three leads, but maybe the movie would have worked better if it weren't so desperately trying to make iconic moments or set things up for future movies which we now know are never going to happen. I suppose this will be a fun enough watch for people who are fans of the three leads or Ritchie fans. For the rest of us its a fantastic blob of absolute nothing. A brightly coloured show with absolutely no heart."
" The Man From F.L.O.P.
",0.0,-0.7399,2017-03-12 00:00:00,2,"It took a very long time for a film to be made of the iconic 1960's spy show 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.', which ran from 1964 - 68 and starred David McCallum as 'Illya Kuryakin' and the late Robert Vaughn as 'Napoleon Solo', globe-trotting agents of the United Network Command for Law-Enforcement. Steven Soderburgh's name was attached to the project at one time, as was George Clooney's. The finished film was directed by Guy Ritchie, and starred 'Superman' actor Henry Cavill as 'Solo'. There was panic among U.N.C.L.E. fans when Jan Hammer ( who played 'Illya' ) gave an interview in which he described the movie's script as 'very funny'. Fears that the new movie would feature dancing gorillas and hiccup gas proved unfounded. It wisely retained the 1960's setting, with Solo and Kuryakin recruited by spymaster 'Mr.Waverly' ( Hugh Grant ) to tackle a mysterious organisation bent on building its own atomic bomb. Like a lot of reboots, it discards almost everything memorable about the original - in this case, Del Floria's shop, the pen-radios, the 'Open Channel D' catchphrase, T.H.R.U.S.H. and - bizarrely - U.N.C.L.E. itself ( to be fair, it does come into existence just prior to the end credits! ). Ritchie must have assumed the film would be popular enough to justify sequels, and therefore, it did not matter if he made a mess of things. Unfortunately for him, it opened to mixed reviews and the public stayed away in droves. It is not a bad film as such, it is just not terribly good. The tone is never properly established, there is zero chemistry between the leading men, the villains are unmemorable, the dialogue is dull, the music poor, and the action sequences lack excitement. Solo's backstory was lifted wholesale from Robert Wagner's 'It Takes A Thief' series: did Ritchie forget which vintage television series he was meant to be remaking? The television series had no backstory for Solo mainly because one was not needed.Sam Rolfe, the show's developer and first season producer, received no credit, and Jerry Goldsmith's classic theme tune was heard only fleetingly ( and then it only a cover version ). At least the much maligned 1998 film of 'The Avengers' did resemble the series it was based on. Ritchie's failure to translate the U.N.C.L.E. concept successfully to the big screen is shamefully inexcusable. The eight movies released by M.G.M. in the !960's were edited versions of television episodes, made on smaller budgets, and yet, for sheer entertainment value, they knock Ritchie's folly into a cocked green hat. Close Channel D!"
" Just brilliant!
",0.6239,0.9379,2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"It's already an old film, but still I watch it again and again. For me, Guy Richie's performance is just amazing. The way he uses lights, camera panning, lens zooming and all this together with the music makes this film so enjoyable. My favorite scene is when Napoleon Solo is captured and tied onto the chair. Uncle Rudi starts to tell his story how he grew up and how he is going to use new Kodachrome film to capture this torture. Lights, lens zooming, music... just brilliant."

Well, I couldn't believe my luck, a Guy Ritchie film minus Mark Strong...... and ...A brilliant adaptation of the original series. Right from the beginning, I was hooked. Guy Ritchie does a brilliant job of recreating the sixties... the cars... the buildings... the clothes... the feel... It is awesome to behold. And the fact that, on the whole, the special effects are real, only using CGI to mask wires, cranes, etc, is superb and makes the movie more believable, sometimes CGI can distance an audience if not used correctly.The opening sequence, a car chase between a Trabant and a Wartburg is one of the best I've had the privilege to watch. Truthfully, all the action sequences are marvellous and great to watch.The directors of ""Man of Steel - Batman vs Superman"" and ""The Lone Ranger"" should take note that their leading men were exceedingly better in this movie than theirs. In fact, Henry Cavill gives a performance as Napoleon Solo, that would also have made a great Superman, not the womanising and arrogant parts of his character, but the surety of the character and his vocals. Armie Hammer is a brilliant Illya Kuryakin, who, in this movie, is more of a powerhouse and doggedly determined. This difference from the original's character makes for a better dynamic between the two spies and a stronger film.I also liked the idea that this is the story of the creation of U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement), and that we get to see a little bit of Waverly's background, again this makes for a stronger film, as well as stronger sequels.This movie is all about style, right from the beautiful opening credits to the closing credits, and the soundtrack is no different. It works so perfectly with the feel of the movie, adding to the action sequences, the romance, and even the comedy.The only reason this didn't rate a 10 was the bloody annoying subtitle's - Guy, you chose the wrong font.If you like stylised spy thrillers with great story telling, action sequences, and brilliant acting, that leave you feeling happy and invigorated then this is a ""buy me"" film. Had I known it was so good I would've purchased at full price and not waited for the price drop. Everybody deserves their money for this endeavour."
" Can't always pick a winner, dad says
",-0.4717,0.755,2017-01-22 00:00:00,2,"Rented this for myself and the parents. Result: snoozefest.I felt like this movie was made by a new director trying to be Guy Ritchie, not by Guy himself. It would have made a good commercial, though: eye-candy actors, high fashion, jarring action scenes. But alas there was no point. Who cares? What does a-Paris-Hilton-look-a-like want with a nuclear warhead? Why does this new organization supersedes the original KGB and CIA? The title is misleading. It should say How Two Men and A Lady Become U.N.C.L.E. It doesn't sound all that exciting now, does it?It doesn't make its mind up on what kind of movie it is. A couple bits of action, a couple bits of silliness, possible romance. If it was a trying to be a James Bond movie, it failed on all counts. I half-expected Melissa McCarthy to jump in at the end. But it wasn't a spoof either. So there, that's my two cents."
" Disappointing But Entertaining
",0.4118,0.9961,2017-01-17 00:00:00,5,"There was a lot I liked about this movie but there were key points I didn't and it missed SO many opportunities it's pretty sad. The movie IS fun to watch, especially for the '60s fashions, and the acting is good, but the plotting isn't much and there are some serious casting mistakes, imho.I got a kick out of the original TV program but even fans have to admit there was plenty bad along with the good. The good was some smart and risk-taking casting, a sense of humor, terrific chemistry between the leads, some fun with the plotting, and key signature features.The acting in this movie is fine. Armie Hammer does a neat job of capturing David McCallum's bemused aplomb, but unfortunately is physically wrong for the part - there just are too many tall pretty boys in the movie. That key miscasting undermines the film from the get go - it's not that there's NO chemistry between Armie and Henry Cavill, it's just that together they look like a Calvin Klein commercial. It has to be said that McCallum was about as Russian as haggis, but he had a unique look and appealing manner that worked in a wide range of roles. Alexander Vinciguerra also needed a different face, as did Alexander Waverly - I love Hugh Grant, but he lacks the visual interest and crusty gravitas of Leo G. Carroll.There's some humor in the relationship between the film's Kuryakin and Solo, but the chemistry isn't at the same level as the series - instead of Robert Vaughn's oily sang-froide, Cavill opts for a sort of bright, cat-that-ate-the-canary manner that defies any real need of a partner - compare his is-my-hair-mussed reaction in the torture scene to the sweating desperation of Vaughn in the infiltration scene in the first episode of the TV show, an affair where the agents couldn't just go around bumping off the opposition. Bottom line: Cavill's performance is good, but wrong for the story.The film provides some pointless backstory for the boys which it would have done much better without. It seems to be a modern (postmodern?) conceit that a remake has to trash the original in some way, and one of the aims of McCallum in creating the Kuryakin character was to make him a mystery man. Another signature of the series was the idea of the ordinary citizen caught up in espionage; this is likewise discarded for the movie.The humor is intermittent. The ""provocation"" scene should have accomplished more than the loss of the watch; it was plain tedious. There're some mild chuckles in the first infiltration, but mild, rather than clever or witty, pretty much characterizes the humor for this film. It just doesn't sparkle.There needed to be more to the '60s aspect than just the fashions. The use (and shortcomings) of real midcentury tech would have done wonders here; neither Austin Powers nor OSS 117 have exhausted the rich vein of '60s attitudes and assumptions that could have given this soufflé some kick; and while there's a bit of history here, the film could have withstood a LOT more. For whatever reason the vehicles for the action set-pieces are strictly anachronistic, another wasted opportunity.The ending was forced, and the unconvincing conceit of a homing device in the decoy was just plain lazy, completely missing the standard of the classic double-edged-sword that characterizes finales for the genre."
" Overlooked and under-appreciated
",-0.0258,0.9544,2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"I have only recently seen this movie, and been wondering why I have not really come across it earlier - and it seems that it has just not been promoted and praised enough.It's a shame, since this movie is highly entertaining, stylish and funny, sun-drenched and full of action, all with a wink in the eye. The 60's aesthetics and music are just irresistibly stylish and classy, and especially the forced collaboration between American spy and master-thief Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and his Russian antagonist and KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer, donning a charming Russian accent) is both hilarious and heartwarming. In their midst is German girl Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), which causes much extra espionage chaos and some romantic sparks flying. It's a true Guy Ritchie movie with all the music, lightness of foot and style that these usually provide. Also, there is some dark-humoured violence and sarcasm, which is what viewers have loved since Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels.My personal big minus is that Alicia Vikander's German (she is Swedish), is so bad, that I as a native German had trouble understanding her - but since Brit Henry Cavill is playing an American, and American Armie Hammer mimes the Russian agent, that is to be excused. Playfulness with nationality seems to be a thing here.If you are looking for an entertaining, action-packed, cool and (plot-twists ahead) exciting movie, this one is it."

Not just as a genre movie, which sets itself apart from modern spy fare with a certain restraint towards its action scenes (even the torture is unconventional), but as a '60s throwback. It creates a stylized Cold War setting, and it's one I totally wouldn't mind returning to; I love that Morricone/Schifrin score.The main cast (Cavill, Hammer and Vikander) shares a great chemistry and just seems to fit. This is another reason there should be a sequel. I mean, really, if there are two Sherlock Holmes movies, we deserve at least one more U.N.C.L.E.Some of Guy Ritchie's movies I do love, and this is one of them.8/10"
