" A funny, light hearted comedy
",0.6597,0.9208,2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"This movie was surprisingly good. It's quite funny at times and doesn't try too hard. Just give it a try, I think you'll find it to be quite enjoyable as well"

I'm searching the cast list."

",-0.5719,0.9986,2020-04-15 00:00:00,5,"Literally, all I knew about this film was the leading actor and that it was about dancing, it looked like a pretty average watch, and the critics gave it mixed reviews, I was still up for it though. Basically, as a teenager, Bruce Garrett (Ben Radcliffe) was a champion salsa dancer winning every award going, and he was gearing up for the biggest, the UK Junior Salsa Championships. But an incident of bullying robs him of his confidence and passion, and he is diverted on a different path. Twenty-two years later, the adult Bruce (Nick Frost) is now an overweight slob working in an office. Recently, he has been trying to get close to his smart, funny, gorgeous new American boss Julia (Rashida Jones). One day, Bruce finds out she has a passion for salsa dancing, and he sees this as his opportunity to impress and woo her. But Bruce is out of practise, so he seeks out his old teacher Ron Parfitt (Ian McShane) to re-master the art of dance. Ron is reluctant at first, forcing Bruce to confront the reasons he quit dancing in the first place. Also, Bruce has a rival in alpha male colleague Drew (Chris O'Dowd), who constantly bullies him, and dominates Julia's attention. Bruce is supported by his salsa teacher, his classmates, including the flamboyant Bejan (Fonejacker's Kayvan Novak), and his former dancing partner, his supportive sister Sam (Olivia Colman). Slowly, Bruce perfects his moves and steps and recaptures his feeling, not only for the dance but for his life. His friends convince him to enter the local nightclub's salsa dance competition, and to invite Julia to be his dance partner. But when Bruce goes to see Julia, Drew is already at her apartment. He is tricked into thinking they are having a sexual encounter, and he leaves without questioning her. After Bruce has left, Julia realises what Drew is up to and outright rejects his advances, kicks him out and threatens his position at work. Julia follows Bruce to the nightclub, where he is doing pretty well with Sam and an old routine, they are about to enter the final heat/round of the competition. Bruce is elated to see Julia has followed him, and finally plucks up the courage to ask her to dance with him. They dance the last round of the competition, Bruce does not win, but regains his true self and finally wins Julia's heart. Also starring Rory Kinnear as Gary, Alexandra Roach as Helen, Steve Oram as Security Guard Kevin, Isabella Steinbarth as Young Sam and Kevin Eldon as Neighbour, and there's a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Simon Pegg as the Driver in Car Park. Frost does well as the lead, Jones is pretty, O'Dowd is good at being nasty, McShane and Colman are fine, and Novak does indeed steal some scenes. I agree with critics, it may have been better to see a large guy trying to pull off Latin dance for laughs, it is taken seriously, and the romance element is only slight, but it does offer up some fun dance sequences and good use of music, and there are some amusing moments, overall it is an average but reasonable romantic comedy. Worth watching!"
" Inconsequential, but warm and fuzzy... to a degree.
",0.3291,0.8802,2020-03-31 00:00:00,7,"Strange film this one, almost a rom-com, but unnecessary foul language detracts from the warm and fuzzy feeling that it nearly generates.To be fair, I wasn't bored for a minute, but I detested Chris O' Dowd's character, which didn't help me warm to the film either.The choreography isn't dazzling by any means, and a bit more music throughout would have helped.Haiving said all that, I'd be likely to watch it again if I wanted a brainless 97 minutes as it was entertaining."
" A good Saturday night fallback
",0.4404,0.4883,2018-10-30 00:00:00,8,"When you can't handle any more strictly or even worse adverts clogging up your Saturday night and you don't want to think too much and you don't want to hear machine guns and explosions and you really just want to be entertainedThen this one is a goodieThe only weak link is the American lady but she does her best while everyone else swings along to make a very watchable and memorable movieThis one did badly on release I believe, but will gather a good fanbase over the yearsWell done to Nick and everyone involved, a British classic for the future"
" It's not a masterpiece, but it's fun.
",0.5111,0.9684,2018-02-17 00:00:00,8,"There are plenty of reviews here breaking down the details, so I won't go into them. The storyline is basically the old ""loser shows he's a winner and gets the girl"" staple, with the salsa dancefloor as the battleground.
The salsa scene portraid is a bit of a caricature, well it's a comedy after all, but I think it gets a lot of the essence of it, all sorts of characters of all shapes and sizes getting together in places varying from upstairs rooms in pubs to big nightclubs and just fun sharing the music and the dancing. It's a parody, but an affectionate one.
And anyone who's danced salsa in London can play ""spot the dancer I know"" in the final scenes, because they used real London salsa dancers as extras. I think I've had lessons from pretty much everyone on that competition dance floor over the years."
" Full of heart
",0.0,0.9967,2017-07-16 00:00:00,7,"A nice little film that is chock full of heart (or of course 'El CorazÃ³n') Nick frost has a geeky charm that means you really can't help but like him whatever he's in. He does well to carry this film as the central character and is helped along by a strong supporting cast. Everyone nails their respective roles, particularly Chris O'Dowd who really is a loathsome creep throughout. It seems weird to see Frost without Pegg as they are so interlinked in our minds (but there is a lovely redeeming shot to make us all feel at ease once again). The dancing and music is fantastic and massive credit to Nick Frost for his skills on the dance floor. My favourite scene by far is a fantastic satirical dance off between frost and O'Dowd to 'win the girl'. This is just brilliant and these two pull it of perfectly. Fun film, good acting, plenty of feel good vibes."
" The game is on, on the salsa floor.
",0.0,0.9814,2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"I had no idea about this film. Just saw its poster and it reminded me 'This Means War'. Sort of like that, but it's not about the spies, instead it was about salsa. An average guy who gave up salsa during his childhood, once again sparked to take it up seriously after finding crush on his new boss who loves salsa. But he's not alone, his colleague who's a bully is on to her and thwarts all his attempts not to get near to her. Now he has to prove, not just to win the love, but his last passion for salsa.Totally a surprising film. It was not utterly a romance theme, but a music, about salsa. The romance was a small part of it. It was somewhat fun, but I find it a bit dramatic about redefining the passion that was given up a log back. And if you love salsa, you might enjoy it. But it was not like those dance flicks from Hollywood. All the important segments of the story come in the second half. Especially the final act was much better, to end on a high. A film to watch once, just for fun.6.5/10"
" Predictable but enjoyable the same
",0.5927,0.9969,2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"Granted -- this is a silly predictable story. Yet, Nick frost wrote it and is in it, so one has to tune in if one is Frost fan. Wherever Frost is, something is cooking. This is the typical love triangle story: average overweight good-hearted honest guy fancy the hot new co-worker girl, but he good man thinks that she would never be interested in him because ladies always prefer the pretty boys no matter how jerky they are, so the good guy hast to do something to win the chick's heart. You know the end before it starts. However, there are a few things that make this film very enjoyable: > First, Frost's performance. He is completely believable as the looser Bruce. > Second, the presence of an odious character, Drew, masterly played by the versatile O'Dowd; if he wasn't believable, the whole movie would fail. > Third, a nice salsa dancing and competition plot. It doesn't matter that none of the actors is a good dancer or a good salsa dancer, that is part of the fun and of the pun! > Four, hilarious dialogues and situations! > Five, an unforgettable scene. I will always remember, I mean always, this movie because of a single scene, the uber-hilarious brilliantly performed, danced and filmed fight between Drew and Bruce in the car park. That was so good, so funny that had me rolling on the floor, well, on my sofa. > Six, this is a feel-good movie with the predictable ending we all want.Simple, funny, unpretentious and enjoyable."
