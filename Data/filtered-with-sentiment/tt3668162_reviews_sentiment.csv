" Not as good as 8.3
",-0.3412,0.2285,2020-11-14 00:00:00,6,"This is clearly a overhyped movie, its good but not great, when i see kumbalangi nights gets the same rating as this film, i dont understand on what basis people give banglore days a 9,10 rating, for me it's clearly a 6."
" Malaylam Magic
",0.0,0.982,2020-09-25 00:00:00,10,"If a movie can hold you to your sit for about 3 hours, then you must understand it is a masterpiece. A movie with no item songs. A movie with a normal day to day story but presented outstandingly. Love story, Life story, Friends Story all in one package. A movie with good actors and good music. I can guarantee you the three hours you invest, it will give you a wonderful memory with this movie."
" Spledid Movie

" Nostalgic and yet hilarious
",0.4019,0.9788,2020-08-17 00:00:00,7,"Divya (Nazriya Nazim) is married to Shiva (Fahadh fasil), who lives in Banglore (now Bengaluru). She got a chance to meet her cousins Ajju (Dulquer Salman) and Krishnan (Nivin Pauly). In first half, we mostly see them together. Their conversations look so real, you don't really see that in films regularly. They actually look like they have spent a lot of time together.As the story moves, we got to know them individually. More characters enter the film. The second half is comparatively less engaging. Now they all have their live interests. Shiva has a back story. Things get complicated but nothing is new. Film loses the charm.There are too many songs. They are lovely but I cannot recall them as I don't Malayalam. There is one song featuring Fahadh Fasil and Nithya Menin even though the later has only one scene in the film.The scenes between Shiva and Divya are the highlight of the film. It could have been the most realistic portrayal of marriage in history of Indian cinema, but got ruined by drama.Nivin Pauly's character is best. He is sweet, gullible, but not a clown like comedians of other films. Nazim's and Fahadh's characters are one-dimensional but the actors added charm to them. Dulquer Salmaan is just satisfactory.There are little subplots, each of them could have been made into a great film. But when put together, they become a mess. A charming and lively film, but not a masterpiece."
" Fun to watch
",0.5106,0.9825,2020-08-15 00:00:00,8,"Bangalore Days - Romantic Social Movie
Cast - Nazriya, Dulquer SalmanA clean, fun-to-watch, interestingly social, silent romantic movie this is. After a long days, I really enjoyed such long movie. This movie is a story of 3 cousins. Their friendship, own life problems, love life everything is framed so amazingly. A total enjoyment. I must say I liked the acting of everyone in this movie. Story progression is slow but fun. There are many comedy scenes and also serious scenes which is a perfect combination. I recommend this movie.Personal Rating - 8/10"
" A perfect feel good movie for Sunday Afternoon
",0.765,0.8834,2020-08-13 00:00:00,10,If you are depressed watch this movie. Its a perfect feel good movie. All the actors have played their part to the T and direction by Anjali menon takes a special mention. Though i am a non Malayalee i saw this movie with sub titles. Songs are meladious and screenplay and dialogues are very good
" Desires last 60 days; lust 30.
",0.0,0.9977,2020-07-28 00:00:00,9,"The stories of the silver screen and fairy tales make us believe that it is worthwhile to grasp that one chance at love. They convince us that it the single most crucial fight that one has to win. Overcoming that would translate to eternal bliss. It is happiness afterwards, forever and ever. Err... wrong answer.In a very entertaining way, combining the scenic backgrounds of Kerala and Bangaluru, as well as the pleasing youthful features of the good looking actors, the story tries to tell us in a subtle way that it is not all hunky-dory when and especially after one finds love. It is an eternal struggle to keep the flames alive. Even if the ember stays aglow, there are too many interferences that threatened its harmony. In modern living, with the relaxation of rigid social restrictions that used to prevail and the scream of empowerment, no one can be pinned down anymore. Everybody is free to do what he (or she) wants. Is that daring to be different, to empower oneself, defiance to status or plain lazy to uphold the age-old agreed norms that rock the whole fabric of marital bliss? Or is it that the desire to defend the holy institution of marriage that makes one overlook or tolerate the many imperfections of the other?The story revolves around three cousins (Kuttan, Arjun and Divya) who are close as thick as thieves sharing an unforgettable childhood and the same sense of humour.Arjun, a son of an army man, went wayward after his parents divorced. We get the sense that he attributes his failure in life to his parents' separation. From a top student, he ended up being a dirt-bike racer and an occasional mechanic. His love interest turns out to be wheelchair-bound paraplegic. The positive thing about the film is the paraplegic character actually had a positive. Unlike a typical India movie where a far from 'perfect' person will usually sacrifice her life, here she is paved the way for a possible happy experience.Happy forever and ever?Kuttan is a goody-two-shoes who followed all the pointers given by his parents and is a software engineer. One day, Kuttan's father disappeared from their home. He left a note citing his desire to find peace and purpose in life. A subsequent letter clarifies that he actually must be enjoying himself in the laid back beaches of Goa, away from the smothering of his wife, Kuttan's mother. Kuttan also realises that his mother, though meaning well, could be quite a pain in the neck when she moved in with him.
Meanwhile, Kuttan is also finding love, naively thinking that a nice traditional Kerala girl would be ideal. His first love, a stewardess, proved disappointing. She used him to get back to her ex-boyfriend!Divya, the only female of the trio, undergoes an arranged marriage to Shiva. After the wedding, Shiva and Divya move to Bangalore. By a twist of fate, her cousins land up in Bangalore. Divya soon discovers that her husband is far from intimate. Their marriage goes through a tailspin. Soon it is found that Shiva keeps a dark secret from his past.The rest of the story is in trying to tie up everybody's life to a resolution and a happy ending. Inserted subtly into scenes are cryptic messages which tend to answer itself. One visible message is how Indians tend to parrot Western's way of dressing and embracing their culture while the Westerners look highly at the Indian way of living and cannot wait to immerse into them.At the end of the film, Kuttan, who was looking out for a typical Bharat Natyam dancing Malayalee with long pleats for matrimony, found one in Michelle, a Caucasian girl fitting the above description!"
" Malyalam Cinema at its best
",0.6369,0.6597,2020-06-29 00:00:00,9,The movie is always fresh and keeps you busy no matter how many times you see it. One of the gems of Indian cinema and Malayalam Cinema is at its best
" You can't miss this!
",0.1867,0.9713,2020-06-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is 2hr 51 mins long...
Before watching this I was thinking how will I watch such a long movie. But as It had Nazriya, Dulquer, Fahaad , Parvathy and Nithya menen etc. As cast So I didn't wanted to miss this.
And guys, when the movie ended I was just shocked.
I was feeling like, how could it end so early!! This should run for some more time...
I was so so.. engaged in the story and the characters, I didn't think of time at all.
Credit goes to acting and Most importantly to Anjali menon mam - Writer and director of Bangalore days.In a nutshell - MASTERPIECE"

" Youtube sketch threaded into movie
",0.0,-0.1531,2020-05-06 00:00:00,5,"Devastatingly long and exhausting.
I even tried to keep up until halfway. But there's just no point, characters are just living mundane life, showing them as cool urban kids. Even after interval, it's just plain and slow.Definitely for casual masala audience.
But not for movie souvenir-ists."
" Illustrating a very Sweet Relationship between Siblings
",0.5095,0.9453,2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,"A life illustrating and out of the box film which showcases one of the sweetest relationships between siblings. Each and everyone in the film had unique character to play. The magic of the movie is these characters actually stay with you even after the movie. Problems related to self doubt, self love and reminiscing past memories each and every issue is highlighted in a beautiful and unique manner. I remember last time I had this feeling was when I watched Tripling. I personally loved the film and will surely recommend it."
" Awesome Movie
",0.6249,0.9442,2020-04-30 00:00:00,10,The wonderful movie in Malayam. Loved this movie. Fabulous movie and their characters they depicted is awesome.
" Not worth the hype
",-0.1695,0.9948,2020-01-29 00:00:00,6,"There are people who review that this movie changed their life and restored hope. I don't get it. This movie is not worth the hype. Like yes, it's a good entertainer and something people can relate to and yeah, I liked it but it definitely didn't do any sort of miracle work for me. The plot is nice and different-something that we don't usually get in Malayalam movies but it doesn't deserve a 10. It's a decent flick that makes you smile at the love the characters have for each other and the simplicity of the story but it's a movie that can only be watched once. It sticks in your mind, sure, but only for a short while. It's a good movie with great acting (and amazing songs) but not one that leaves a lasting impression. It's good to watch if you're bored and wanna kill time.Oh, but Nivin Pauly was the best part of the whole movie. Just saying."
" Title of the movie is just a cheap marketing strategy
",0.0,-0.8674,2020-01-10 00:00:00,5,"I like the movie but overrated and what makes me furious is the name of the movie
Why name it Bangalore Days when the movie doesn't have any essence of Bangalore or the locals in it. The title could have been anything like.. Golden days, college days, etc. This movie is a total insult to Bangalore. Just a cheap strategy to get more viewers."
" Wow!
",0.6239,0.7253,2020-01-03 00:00:00,10,"I just stumbled across this movie on Amazon and I can't stop thinking about it.
I am now trying to figure out how to watch every movie by Anjali Menon.
Incredible cast, story and direction. And the cinematography had me longing for Bangalore. Kudos!"
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9049,2019-11-07 00:00:00,9,"I've watched so many films but this movie is quite different and unique.Amazing writing, Direction, Cinematography and wonderful acting no doubt.This is the quality of an Indian cinema and everyone should watch this movie once.Everything is so good, emotional and mesmerizing.I do not know Malayalam language but didn't feel a language barrier for a single moment.Must watch movieKudos to the whole team of this movie."
" Refreshing movie with perfect cast and splendid performances
",0.8176,0.9897,2019-11-07 00:00:00,9,"I am a native of Maharashtra having Marathi as my mother tongue. This was my first Malayalam movie. And I am completely in love with the Malayalam film industry. 'Bangalore Days' is just awesome. Don't miss this one.
Pros:
1. Perfect casting- It seems each character is living the role for long.
2. Performances- Almost all the actors including the lead and supporting cast has done a splendid job. Although Parvathy is the show-stealer in every scene of her, her co-stars Dilquer, Nazariya, Naveen are too good in this feel-good flick. Fahadh's portrayal of Das is commendable as well.
3. Characterization- I just fell in love with Parvathy's character of RJ Sarah. Her voice and charm give so many positive vibes. Also, the dialogues and her expressions are priceless.
4. Plot and execution- Three characters each having 2 stories running, dozens of sub-characters, story going back and forth yet all this is tied together with brilliance.Cons:
Fahadh doesn't suit in the role of Shiva. I was not convinced to see the silent Das getting shown as ruthless rider Shiva.
The relationship between Kuttan and Meenakshi unconvincingly blossomed in minutes which for a moment was like a dream of Kuttan."

" ""Lovely, soft & heart warming film""
",0.1531,0.9833,2019-05-27 00:00:00,9,"It gives me indescribable pleasure. It's really a very soft, lovely & romantic film. The musics were also very good although I didn't get them clearly! Acting was good by the role characters. The best thing here is the plot & the flow of the moments. It also provides some little good messages regarding life. I had not been little bored watching it. It touched my heart. Best one!"
" A heartwarming and beautifully written story with meticulous execution!
",0.7959,0.6077,2019-05-20 00:00:00,10,"I have started watching Malayalam movies recently. This is the second movie of my Malayalam watchlist. Once started, I couldn't pause it. The casts were brilliant, the flow and twists were on point. Being an inhabitant of a big city, I never realized that life in a city is not just giant buildings or getting stuck in traffic. Life is so full of surprises. You just have to believe in it."
" Movie that bestowed my belief on good movies
",0.4404,0.9287,2018-12-30 00:00:00,9,"Loved this movie so much that I watched it so many times and made others also watch and translated it to them.. enjoyed each and every character of the movie and lived the momemts of the film...three lives, their ambitions and life and how it unfolds along the passage of time.
It actually gave me strength and belief to trust THE CONTENT of Malayalam movies these days."
" Love the movie as a Malayalee and as a human
",0.6369,0.4939,2018-10-16 00:00:00,10,This movie has all the elements that you look for in a movie .. the childhood memories.. the struggles of a new city .. meeting new friends .. all in all an absolute entertainer .. and each of the actors are stars .. and biggest of them all the director
" Must watch

" Just love it
",0.6369,0.4019,2018-04-16 00:00:00,10,Bangalore days is full of life. The movie talks about the tale of three cousins who travel to Bangalore in the pursuit of chasing their dreams.
" Different movie-
",0.0,0.9772,2017-09-27 00:00:00,9,"In the beginning, I couldn't much understand where the story was heading, but eventually it started feeling good. Had the feeling of watching a movie that I could relate myself with, after a long time. ANd thats probably why I loved the movie.Comedy was something I really loved. All of this, after I watched the movie with subtitles(I don't know Malayalam). And I can't imagine how I would have felt had I known Malayalam. Edit: I have watched this movie three times, three days in a row, which has never happened for me with any other movie. The more I watched it, the more I am loving it."
" Must watch
",0.0,0.9728,2017-08-22 00:00:00,9,"The first thing that came in my mind is Anjali menon, I have just started to see Malyalam cinema and i have this desire to meet Anjali and tell personally how incredible work she is doing. Story is soul of the movie, a real hero in true sense. I am seeing a pattern in her work , weather it's her first movie Manjadikuru or ustad hotel, writing is superb.she presents her philosophy very gently by not being over the top. Banglore days is no exception to this pattern.you will love this cinema. outstanding background score,great acting and i read somewhere a line by a critic weather Salman Dulkar have ever given a bad movie and no, he hasn't. that's seems very much true. Same goes for Nivin Polly, he too has delivered a great performance. overall a must watch cinema. You will not be disappointed."
