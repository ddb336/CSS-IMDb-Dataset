" An inteligent effort.
",0.0,0.9433,2021-03-29 00:00:00,9,"Through out the movie I felt that it was a decent effort to make an entertaining movie, however in the last sequence *spoiler starts* the reversal of gravity* just blew me away and I could not stop smiling as to how intelligently the movie makers crafted this movie around Dante's inferno. The whole movie now made enough sense to me. It now made me to think and jump on to internet.People rating low for this movie based on mere aesthetics ,which in my opinion are actually great, have no clue about the depth of the plot.Teams who bring out such intelligent products of art should be applauded and appreciated. Highly recommended."

If they were so gung-ho about their mission, why bother with filming? They weren't even making a documentary. This was a lot of wasted potential."
" Generic found footage gimmicks
",0.0,-0.8617,2021-03-22 00:00:00,4,"Conceptually there are a lot of things that work here. If they had just stuck to a horror version of National Treasure without the cameras constantly shaking, blinking on and off, etc. I would have given this movie 3 more stars. Lazy jump scares and loud sound effects add to the frustration of what is a solid premise. I guess if you are going to film yourself during an archeology adventure you should have more reliable equipment that doesn't keep going in and out."

",-0.1038,-0.802,2021-03-07 00:00:00,1,I'm so irked at the dude who loved this movie and recommend it to me because I like David Lynch and strange films. The cameras constantly moving is maddening. A weak plot. Zero character development. And a big nothing burger of an ending. It was just bad. So bad. It's kind of a Blair Witch Type of movie except Blair Witch was pretty ok. And this is just crap.
" Love this movie

" ""Indie'film Jones and the Sewer of Doom""
",-0.4019,-0.9535,2021-03-06 00:00:00,1,"WARNING! Some spoilers...Well, Perdita Weeks is, unquestionably, a skilled actress, and was the only reason my wife and I clicked-up the flick in the first place. Unfortunately, this bit of phlegm... er, um... I mean... ""film""... is, unquestionably, one of the most atrocious wastes of time and money in the entire history of atrocious wastes of time and money.Ms. Weeks, in general, is smart, funny, quick, self-deprecating, and possesses an excellent sense of comedic timing, all of which she demonstrates regularly in her current, thoroughly-enjoyable role of Juliet Higgins, on ""Magnum, P.I."" (Yes, it's a formulaic, procedural ""reboot"", but it's still fun! Unlike this movie...)Alas, although her performance was among the only bright spots in this ""stain on the entertainment industry"", few, if any, of her skills were needed or on display here. In fact, considering their ages and limited experience, most of the cast of ""As Above..."" delivered creditable performances which rose considerably above their material and direction, and they will, quite likely, have decent careers in their field.The Brothers Dowdle? (screenwriters / director) Maybe not so much...First, let me say, I have nothing against ""cinema verite"", per se. Just as, ""Variety is the spice of life..."", so cinema verite can be the ""spice"" of motion-picture-making, when used properly and sparingly, by a genuinely talented director. Well-crafted films such as the ""Bourne"" trilogy and ""District 9"" are tremendously enhanced by its judicious application. When flagrantly abused by a rank amateur, however, as the only cinematographic ""arrow"" in their ""quiver"", and relentlessly wreaked upon the full length of a feature film, it's more like some clueless idiot pureed a half-dozen Carolina Reapers into a single bowl of chili!The only thing more annoying (...and that's pretty irritating, just on its own!), is, perhaps, partly my own problem - as a professional camera operator for more than four decades, it's easy for me to recognize whenever ""shaky-cam"" is, in reality, ""faky-cam"", with some moron deliberately jostling the camera around, utterly failing to achieve a sort of ""simula verite"", while congratulating him or herself on their ""creativity""! (It's hard to ""suspend my disbelief"" when half my brain is screaming, ""Go buy a cheap tripod, ya cheap biped!"")This is the main reason I have virtually no use, whatsoever, for any of the ""fully-found-footage"" films which have been inflicted on a long-suffering viewing public over the last several decades. (Fortunately, the trailers and advertising matter told me all I needed to know in order to scrupulously avoid ""Blair Witch Project"" (1999) - while it may not have been the first, it was certainly one of the worst! Sadly, I wasn't quite so lucky with ""Monster"" or ""Cloverfield"" (both 2008).)""Predictable"" hardly begins to adequately describe just how predictable this movie is. ""Hackneyed""? ""Trite""? ""Unoriginal""? Now, we're getting a little closer... It starts out with such promise, then descends into the catacombs under Paris, and straight into every shopworn, threadbare clich√© and trope there is in the ""Doomed-Expedition-Into-The-Mysterious-And-Accursed-Dark-Underbelly-Of-History"" genre. The typical ""obsessed professor/scientist with something to prove"", dragging along her ""reluctant sidekick/possible once-and-future love-interest"" (...the ""hapless schmuck with the paranoid terror of {fill-in-the-blank plot-device}""...), hires the requisite ""rag-tag, slightly-psycho, basically-mercenary troupe"", led by the ""cocky local tour guide"" (""I am NOT ze tour guide!""). Then, they all dive, head-first, into the ""hopelessly-under-lit set-piece du jour"", ""ill-equipped and under-prepared"", ""barely one step ahead of the law"", etc., etc., etc., blah, blah, flippin' blah...From the moment the piano demonstrated its ""...A4 key..."", it was absurdly self-evident that the ""evil"" section of the catacombs, into which they had ineptly and incompetently allowed the obviously-dead ""La Taupe"" to ""Will-o'-the-Wisp"" them (I was literally shouting at the screen, ""Quit lettin' him dance out ahead of ya, barely at the outer edges of your lights! Grab him, and force him to stop talkin' in riddles, right now, or you're all doomed!""), was using their own minds against them, and that the hyper-realistic illusions it was presenting were it's only real ""weapon"". That, and the tired, old, ""every tunnel always conveniently caves-in right behind you, so you can't turn back now"" gag.Sheesh!Who keeps handing money to the talentless children who dream-up this kind of drivel? How many truly creative films will never be made, now that the money which should have been wisely invested in them was, instead, wasted on worthless drek like this? I'd much rather have just watched an actual documentary on the Paris catacombs... (In point of fact, now that I think about it, I actually HAVE watched documentaries on the Paris catacombs - vastly more interesting than this nonsense! ...and I sincerely hope those were all plastic ""prop"" skeletons they were crawling over and trashing, not somebody's ancestors!)And, can anyone please explain to me: What the heck is the point of going to all the hassle of shooting in the actual catacombs of Paris, when you end up with less than 5 minutes of screen-time, out of 90 minutes' run-time, wherein you can actually tell it's ""...the actual catacombs of Paris...""?!?Summing-up: Although the lady, herself, is a talented performer, I have to say, this particular Perdi Weeks vehicle was ""purty weak""!"

" Creepy as hell (see what I did there?!)
",-0.7088,0.9361,2021-02-26 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie. I wish it was easier to find horror movies that are as creepy as this one. Most horror films lack a good plot. Not this one. I enjoyed the archeological/mystical aspect of it. Basically it's an exploration expedition going really wrong. I have to say I felt really claustrophobic watching them crawl in those scary tunnels. I also liked the reference to Dante's Inferno. It's sort of a modern way to tell the story. It wasn't a perfect movie but it was really good. The acting, filming and direction were good and so was the writing. I also liked the fact that it was not too gory. Most horror movies are filled with stupid characters, cheap jump scares and lots of blood and gore. Here we have an interesting plot and well written characters and even though some of their decisions weren't the smartest (like going in there in the first place) most were justified (like when they had no other choice). All in all I thought the movie was pretty good and definitely worth a watch."
" Entertaining
",0.4404,-0.667,2021-02-25 00:00:00,7,"I watched this while painting my nails, so, I was entertained enough. So I didn't find the movie boring as some said.
It has some memorable moments, really. Sound played in a good way and had some twists that I didn't anticipate.. well, I don't watch any movie or tv show wanting to know what will be going to happen next.
What I didn't like is the fact that some characters died. Why isn't a horror movie were nobody dies? At least I expect someone hurt, even a lot.. even mentally, but not in here (some did, but not main characters)
And I leave with one recurrent phrase of many movies like these:-He's dead!!!!
-ok, we need to move."
" Great Supernatural Horror! Truly haunting.
",0.3595,0.4182,2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Once the film gets through the mandatory introductions and the main character's machismo and ridiculous personal credentials, (she's far too young to have achieved even half of what's on her C.V.), this film moves very swiftly into a truly horrifying supernatural/action adventure.""As Above So Below"" (great title!) really begins when the team enters the catacomb caves deep under the streets of Paris. Many really scary vignettes all the while the team moves deeper into the tunnels, getting more lost with each turn.This is truly one of the very best of the ""Blaire Which"" style, live ""Go Pro"" scare fests. You WILL remember many of the parts in this film as a truly haunting adventure."
" Just don't go BELOW!
",0.0,0.92,2021-02-24 00:00:00,6,"I am not really a fan of the found footage genre, although I did enjoy the Blair Witch & the universally panned Appolo 18, yet when I saw it starred Perdita Weeks (Titanic series & the Tudors) I thought I would give this a go because I have enjoyed her work so far. Now I have been a horror fan all my life, but this movie is not really a ""horror"" in the classic sense, nor is it an action thriller, yet it is somewhere in between the two. It is not brilliant, but it is not bad either for something on a low budget. The story line is a bit messy, so unless you pay it your complete attention from start to finish, otherwise this watching expierence wont work. & I keep the DVD sutitles on so I dont miss mumbled dialogue. Also the ""found footage"" camera work is occasionally bizarre, very bad & headache inducing, as well the editing which was nothing short of whacky. However, this is a decent, entertaining movie, which is imaginative in it's execution. is paced well & does not try to be too ambitious. The acting is good & the whole thing was actually fimed on location in the Paris Catacoombs as opposed to a sound stage. This I believe adds a sense of realism. Having visited the Hell Fire Caves in Britain, I could really appreciate how the location filming for this felt very claustrophobic, creepy & mysterious. So as such I would not reccommend this movie to anyone who suffers from claustrophobia as this really comes across in the movie & adds to the tension. The character development is not brilliant which lets the movie down a bit & there were heaps of gaps in back stories & the ending is a bit of a dissapointment.Overall though this is not a bad little movie, just don't have high expectations if your going to watch this. Personally I would have liked to see more Hellish monster demons stalking our heros in the tunnels, but this is my preference as I love horror movies, but this movie has quite convinced me that if I ever find myself in Paris I will certainly do a tour of these awesome catacoombs!"

" Rally good
",0.4404,0.0329,2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"As Above, So below it's a well made found footage horror. It's a 93-minute survival-horror adventure set in the catacombs underneath Paris that are a literal ""Empire of Death"". It's creepy, with good performances and full of suspense. Some of the manifestations work very well to heighten the eerie atmosphere. Near the end of the movie there's a scene that i personally found exaggerated. However they take full advantage of all the elements that make the catacombs scary in real life.

" Not fully explored the theme
",0.0,0.3601,2021-02-16 00:00:00,6,It is a good story indeed. The team explores the Catacombs of Paris which then leads to the Gate of Hell and then kinda make their way back to human world. Plus a bit of treasure hunting and alchemist theories. Yet the plot cannot effectively put all these elements together. Neither is the visual effects stunning nor entertaining. So most of the time I can just see people running around. The whole movie really drags me even with the minimal sound effects.I give it 6 stars because of the story. It's a beautiful story if u read it as a novel.
" It'd have been better if it made some sense
",0.4404,-0.8333,2021-02-09 00:00:00,3,"The movie starts with a lot of promise and for some time seemed to be great. But as they advance, it's like they entered on some alternative dimension or into some dream, or simply hell where they are being toyed with.A lot of elements are present which lack explanation, like the dead body which doesn't rot.First the stone works, then it doesn't, then it's the wrong stone, then she has to go all the way back, then they don't even bother to show her finding the stone nor show it!It's another movie that looks like to go out of budget and they don't have time to shoot the rest of the movie and just rush it.Shame."
" National Treasure but spooky!
",0.2244,0.8404,2021-02-06 00:00:00,7,"I loved the ease into the horror of this movie, and how firmly the main characters are introduced. We get an interesting cast, and we get to see most of them survive! I thought the expedition into the catacombs was also a fresh idea, using academia and ultimately an innocent venture to lead into the scarier material. I wasn't bored while watching, and the terror of being trapped in those tunnels with god-knows-what was palpable. Definitely a good watch."
" Meeehhhh
",0.0,-0.3907,2021-02-06 00:00:00,6,I remember instantly regretting buying this on DVD. I think it's because once you watch it you kinda don't want to watch it again for a long time. A bit Meeehh for me.
" Decent story, poor acting, falls in the mid-ground
",-0.4767,-0.9831,2021-01-29 00:00:00,6,"A horror with a rating above a 6 and some actual acclaim? I thought, this cannot be true. Still, I felt it was worth trying at least, and the Parisian catacombs make a more intriguing setting than most you see in the oh-so-formulaic genre.In the depths of Paris' underground, this modern adaptation of the Seven Levels of Hell (from Dante's Inferno) was actually well founded; instead of just winging through a frail plot, some literary significance was afforded to the story.This is not entirely backed up by the found-footage concept (pretty strung out now) or the acting (which is worse), but still creates a better horror than we're used to. The idea of looking for the Philosopher's Stone is fine, but falls away when you introduce the rest of the cast: this includes some unhinged French spelunkers, an American documentary maker and a criminal repairman (really).In the catacombs themselves, various horror clich√©s are used (with a decent combination of audial and visual scares), but it isn't much you won't have seen before. Furthermore, plot holes are rife throughout, and some of the decisions the group make might also be seen as slightly nonsensical.The conclusion is probably the biggest shock: there actually is one! Still, for a dose of horror that doesn't lean completely on jump scares, you could do a lot worse."
" A very good suggestion for the genre and one of the best claustrophobic thrillers.
",0.8173,-0.2764,2021-01-24 00:00:00,7,"Horror / mystery movie. An extremely claustrophobic and generally dark thriller shot with a moving camera (like REC, Cloverfield etc). The protagonist tries to complete her father's research on the search for an ancient artifact, the philosophical stone. She illegally assembles a small group to follow the elements that lead her somewhere near the catacombs of Paris. They enter through some hidden entrances and dare to go through passages that no one had gone for hundreds of years until then. From the moment they enter these passages, and as they go deeper and deeper into the earth, strange things happen that confuse the protagonists and the watcher who does not know if they are real or illusions. Whatever is down there, however, is much more and darker than the philosophical stone they are looking for. Eventually the only way out is to keep going further and further down and deeper. Many things from the middle of the journey onwards are inexplicable and even more strange is the end that confuses the watcher even more. Although it does not have many effects and does not show many things, the film is shot in such a way as to capture the anxiety of the protagonists, who performed very well, and also to maintain a high level of suspense until the end of the film. It is somewhat reminiscent of The Descent (2005) in terms of claustrophobic style in caves and passages. A very good suggestion for the genre and one of the best claustrophobic thrillers."
" Another found footage movie...
",0.0,-0.8658,2021-01-20 00:00:00,6,"But a cut above. This viewer has struggled through plenty of found footage over the years and found myself consistently left frustrated. AASB fills the gaps in its faults with a terrific atmosphere and rarer approach to supernatural horror. It mirrors Dante's Inferno and so what could be meaningless has some symbolism at play that isn't beaten over your head with.It's not Ingmar Bergman layered but it fits the tone of the story and plays into the whole Uncharted/Lara Croft adventure thing. Weird old artifacts, a confident and comically qualified protagonist (4 degrees...?) Sure, the characters are more undefined composites, but that's no unheard of pitfall in horror.But the movie is more the setting than the personalities. It's scary in how loopy their surroundings get and not more so the overblown audio-visual, even if it's not all overdone. For what could've been a throwaway dollar movie this was solid."
" Definitely Worth a Watch

Intelligent writing from start to end. It's not about classic gore or spirituality but human perception and the how highly deceptive it is.

Initially I gave this film an 8 out of 10. Then I read an analysis of the film, watched it again, and only then could I really appreciate As Above, So Below in its entirety. With inspiration drawn from Dante's Comedy (in such a way that the main characters seem to have ended up in the inferno that Alighieri describes; think of the scene in which Papillon protrudes only with his legs out of the sand, something that down to the letter occurs in Dante's Comedy) I find As Above, So Below something entirely different, and that alone is an accomplishment in the horror genre since these days most horror flicks are similar to each other, the characters are flat and the tropes are repetitive. 10/10 for a film I often think about."

" Scary as Hell and Highly Underrated
",-0.8316,-0.0018,2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"As far as found-footage style horror movies go, this one is highly underrated. Comparative to Blair Witch Project, being the one all other of this style in the genre tends to be judged against, As Above So Below is much faster paced with some higher intensity scenes of action and suspense, deeper seated mystery and horror, and a better developed plot and characters. The historical context and realistic setting of the story taking place in the Catacombs of Paris adds to the percieved realism and creepiness of the plot.
Actor Ben Feldman had a dynamic part in the 2009 Friday the 13th reboot, it's only fitting he got a leading role, and fits it really well. However Perdita Weeks' character tends to be the annoying determined know-it-all, if her acting to fit that role was intentional, she did a good job.
Give this film a serious consideration for a good horror movie."

It passed an evening, and I've seen worse films. It provided s few jump scares, like when the lights come on there's a surge of music and a ghost screaming in your face. But after they done that so many times it kinda wears thin.
The ending doesn't really make much sense but by that time you don't really care. your just thankful its finished and you can get to bed"

" Terrible.
",-0.4767,-0.9928,2020-10-22 00:00:00,2,"A horror movie where I actively wished for the death of the protagonist.As Above, So Below takes an interesting concept about the Parisian catacombs and tries to make a supernatural horror thriller from it. Yet, it falls flat on delivery and is riddled with horror movie cliches. It's not even that scary.It's subpar at best and not worth a second viewing. The audience never cares for the characters as there is no character development. No one learns to care for any of the characters and the movie becomes a slog through until the end credits.Perdita Weeks/Scarlett tries to be an adventurous protagonist but comes off as annoying and insensitive to artifacts. She's more of an annoying self-righteous vandal than an archaeological scholar. Can I blame her though? Seems that her character's flaws are more from the screenplay than the actor herself.And the movie is a bit confusing. The audience never understands the catacombs underground. Characters seem unaffected by pressure physics no matter how deep they go. No one makes a plan to get back out. Did I mention that new elements about the catacombs are constantly thrown into the movie? It makes quite a confusing experience.Also, just because this film references Dante's Inferno doesn't make this film ""deep."" Having characters with personal issues that come back to haunt them is a common movie trope. Having to do some googling after the film to find out who-did-what in their previous lives doesn't make this film interesting at all. The film ends up explaining all the relevant plot points rather than showing them to the audience. That's not good filmmaking, that's lazy filmmaking.1/5. I hated it but at least the film keeps the pain short at ~90m."

" Don't Believe the Critics
",0.2235,0.1747,2020-10-05 00:00:00,7,"Now, don't go into this movie expecting the next Shining. That being said, the movie is still pretty damn good. I was pleasantly surprised after my first viewing, as I was expecting it to be another forgettable found footage movie. But this one stuck with me.First, while I'm not a huge fan of shaky-cam found footage, you can't fault this movie for it. Rather than creating sets, a majority of the movie was filmed in the actual Paris Catacombs. Since the tunnels are tight, I don't blame them for using small handheld cams. In fact, I admire this movie for using a real-life location as a filming locale, especially one as claustrophobic and frightening as the Catacombs. It adds a nice level of realism to the film.The plot is incredibly original. Compared to the now-tired horror movie plot tropes, such as slashers or demonic possession, this movie places the characters in the Catacombs of Paris in search of the legendary philosopher's stone. However, as they descend deeper, they enter the nine circles of Hell themselves, as referenced in The Inferno. Major props to the screenwriter(s) for turning a standard-looking horror flick into an homage to Dante. I suggest you either read The Inferno or read the plot synopsis before watching, if you haven't done so. The parallels are a lot of fun to find as the movie progresses.That being said, it does have some slight issues. Strange character decisions, some cheap jumpscares, somewhat subpar acting, and plenty of plot points that either don't make sense or create plot holes can be found throughout this movie. However, this does not affect one's overall enjoyment of the movie, if one is looking to have a good time watching an entertaining movie.I was shocked when I saw that this film was hated by critics. Sure, it isn't perfect, but it's oppressively frightening atmosphere and original plot makes this one of my favorites in the found footage genre."

" ""Going Down, Down, Down""
",0.0,0.9139,2020-10-03 00:00:00,8,"Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.It is found footage in the catacombs of France so in addition to shaky cam and odd angles, it does feel really claustrophobic at points. If you were okay with ""The Descent"", then you're likely fine.This is based off of a real thing that people do, exploring existing structures, some lost through history, others unused, and even more that are assumed inaccessible from the the layman.Personally, instead of making these places a crime, people should be able to add infrastructure as needed, but it is the primer for the events of the actual movie. Chased down into the catacombs, they basically just keep going towards insanity.There are so many good points in the psychological horror of it all, and the great unknown of the caves plus random acts of terror makes a great formula for the events of this movie.Probably the best ""philosopher's stone"" story I've ever seen."

It peaked my interest, but I never thought or felt the need to seek it that is until last night fate had sealed the deal.I went in with no expectations other than the short vague review from other viewers recommending to watch it and that it's a documentary style movie.Well, needless to say I was pretty entertained and horror is my favorite genre. I love to get scared. Horror movies do not scare me much so I seek that to get my fill. It has some jump scares and considering how this was really filmed inside the catacombs of France, that's a scary concept. There's a deep history to that.The movie models itself over Dante's Inferno and I never realized that until the end.I would recommend this movie for any fans of horror.

I re-watch this film from time to time, each time acknowledging the flaws it has, but still loving it.The film is very well done on a technical level, the tunnels feel authentic and claustrophobic enough, you never doubt that the characters are really there.The paranormal subplot is interesting, but it is shoved to the side, it is never the focus of the story. They provide for good interesting and scary imagery, but they never really dive deep into the characters, which, supported by the writing, should've been the main focus.Thus, the most interesting parts are rushed through, and some of the things established are left untouched and unanswered.Yet I still love this film and I might just give it a re-watch in a couple of years again. I can recommend this to horror fans because just how atmospheric it is, I wish they wouldn't rush through the important parts though."

",0.4404,0.6924,2020-07-27 00:00:00,5,"An expedition/treasure hunt into the Paris catacombs. An interesting idea. The first half hour of the movie sets this up nicely. Then the decent. The rest of the story takes place in the underground mystical fun house, complete with random magic tricks, apparitions and homicidal rock people. The scare factor relies heavily on the constant panic and hysteria of the characters, and the random, nonsensical freaky things that happen. On a side note, I find hand held camera footage in the dark to be distracting, and this was most of the movie. It was mildly entertaining and it doesn't stop for a second. This along with a decent level of scary was it's salvation. I would have liked to have seen their journey play out with a little more thought and a little less luck."

" Modern Dante's Inferno
",0.0,-0.9447,2020-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Not historically a fan of found footage horror (film was my girlfriend's choice to watch), I found the film intriguing and claustrophobic and genuinely creepy and once I realised the references to hell in the catacombs, it became apparent the group were travelling through the nine circles of hell from Dante's Inferno, with a sub-plot involving the philosopher's stone.I think a lot of people writing the reviews on here have missed this important connection and are unfairly labelling the film as clich√©d. Whilst some of the scare techinques may well be clich√©d, this homage to Dante makes for impelling viewing.The truly creepy and claustrophobic middle section of the film does start to lose its focus towards the end and veers into the unbelievable, though only through uninitiated eyes."
" I'm thoroughly spooked and have a lot of opinions now
",0.0,-0.8286,2020-06-24 00:00:00,8,"To begin, this film plays on two of my (and plenty other's) biggest fears - enclosed, tight spaces and the dark. I get very anxious in the dark so combing all this with the first person style, yep, you got me. The movie has been over for about 10 minutes now and my chest is still tight.I don't watch many found footage style movies and the few I have seen were underwhelming. However, this one just works. I went in knowing nothing but the name (didn't even read the description on Netflix) so I had no idea what to expect. You're thrown into the catacombs with them, not just watching what happens from the sidelines but now you're part of their adventure.The whole premise of film is drafted well enough and told effectively - it's like Indiana Jones meets The Descent via Blair Witch to solve the Di Vinci Code. It's not some crazy original never been done before plot though. I give the actors props. We see a lot of close up faces and those faces look convincingly terrified.The first 20 minutes or so I was only half paying attention. Listening to the two of them directly translate some ancient languages to find hidden treasure was kind of laughable. Then they manage to convince an entire group of people to join in their crazy quest. Meh, but not meh enough to turn it off. Once Benji is stuck in the first tunnel, I put my phone down. I do not like caves, I do not like tight spaces.From there, they continue to make a few questionable decisions, like many a horror movie character does, but I'm not sure how rational I'd think in their situation. Attach yourself to a rope before you jump into unknown and cloudy water! Stop touching stuff!After Siouxie gets her face bashed in, it really picks up and just builds on all that tension and plenty of really creepy stuff happens. When dude got stuck inside the cave floor, feet sticking up yet still alive...oh lord, no. The hooded demon alone in a chair inside a giant cavern in the damn dark? I wouldn't walk near that dude if my life depended on it.Then the end was kind of weird and I'm not totally sure how the upside down thing is supposed to work but I won't really question it. I'm satisfied enough.Acting 8/10
Storyline 6/10
Personal scare factor 9/10"

Yes I know Blair Witch started it all, a great film by the way, but even that looked calm & tranquil compared to the ridiculous OTT camera work. Didn't the DP or a producer have a word in the ear of the director to cut it out? If not why not? The cast did well, but I wouldn't like to see this again."
" National Treasure, but make it ""scary""
",0.1531,0.9809,2020-05-30 00:00:00,4,"Big sigh.Where to begin. This movie broke me a little bit. It started off so strong. Great opening set up (maybe a little slow, but great build), great acting, and great premise. They set up a lot of plot points that have major payoffs later, which tied up almost all loose ends. Everything else is nitpicky.I really liked the hand cam documentary style of filmmaking they used. It made the viewer feel more claustrophobic, and really added to the tension. The horror was hit or miss for me. Some parts really kept me on the edge of my seat, mainly the bits where characters got stuck or caved in on.Where it lost me, was the editing. The trippy jump cut strobe light effect brought me out of the movie entirely, and felt like a cheap gag. Not to mention, the jump scares of people walking in the background were lazy and added nothing.I was still rooting for this movie up until the scene where the stone repaired a broken arm. Even that was somewhat forgivable, but it was a huge turning point in the movie. From then on, magic was real and it went from kind of creepy to very cheesey and predictable. The editing got worse, characters started dying at an alarming pace, and things didn't make any sense.The moment I lost all hope and respect for this movie, was the second the lead realized ""the magic was inside her the whole time"". Then, and you can't make this garbage up, she heals her new boy toy with true loves kiss. What. I actually yelled at my tv. Had I paid to see this in theaters, I would have thrown my popcorn and walked out.It felt out of place, cheesey, and cheap. I felt robbed of an above average horror movie. This movie made me want to learn to edit so I could fix everything I hated about the end 30 minutes.From there, the movie ends in the exact same way as Disney's Enchanted. True loves kiss saves the day, they emerge from an upside down man hole, and everyone lives happily ever after. Unbelievable.Bonus: this is a minor detail, but there is no reason for them to be using miles and feet. The lead is from London, they are in Paris, and so was Nicholas Flamel is French. They should be using the Metric system yet constantly talk in terms of feet. Bothers me greatly."

" As Above, So Below
",0.0,-0.7647,2020-05-05 00:00:00,7,"A group of young people must face their demons and actual demons in the Catacombs of Paris.Our main character is Scarlett who is an archaeologist and explorer of all historical and ancient things. She has enlisted the help of Benji, a videographer who plans to record their journey in the depths of Paris for a documentary he's completing. The search is for the philosopher's stone which Scarlett has discovered is 370 feet below ground in the Catacombs of Paris. While down there, the group encounters a lot of religious and demonic imagery. The further they go, the more confusing things get as well. The enter rooms and areas that mirror image places they just left minutes ago. Eventually, the evil forces attack the group one by one until the remaining people are forced to face their inner sins and guilts or be trapped down there forever.There are really effective scares when the group is down in the catacombs. With it being a found footage film, there are a lot of jump scares that come from when the camera swivels quickly to an eerie image of something down there. I give a lot of credit for the filmmakers getting permission to film in the actual catacombs and not creating a set, very neat. Some of the things they were able to do down there are impressive. Also, I am not a claustrophobic person .... but this movie made me feel it. I felt all the beats of being in such a tight dark space with no idea what lurks around each corner.The film loses me a bit on character development which is big for a movie like this. Not only should I care about these people, but I should have an even better understanding of their pasts and sins to make better connections to what they go through in the catacombs. Pretty decent acting from pretty unknown actors, Perdita Weeks leading the charge as Scarlett. I just found the script didn't take time to develop the characters other than an extremely basic overview of what they've done/or lost in their pasts.As Above, So Below is a pretty effective found footage/claustrophobic look into the Catacombs of Paris. It works well as a horror movie as there are plenty of nerve racking tense scares. Shoddy character development and script, but overall a must see for any horror fan for sure.7/10"
" Massive bore of a film
",-0.25,-0.8686,2020-04-21 00:00:00,4,"Touted as a horror film but it's not at all scary, it's just silly characters running around screaming whilst covered in dust. And blood. That's pretty much it. And yet another movie filmed using the 'found footage' style which is highly irritating because you can't see what's going on most of the time. Not that that's a great loss."
" Poor performance
",-0.4767,-0.5806,2020-04-19 00:00:00,3,"It didnot scare me at all. I found the acting performance very poor, without any emotion expressed on their faces except in a very few scenes. It started well to make u curious but gradually it gets stale. Didn't like the movie."
" Eerie and memorable
",-0.3612,0.9897,2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,"As Above, So Below might just make it onto my favourite horrors of all time. Why? Because it achieved what so few are able to do - it genuinely scared me.The movie follows archaelogist and historical researcher, Scarlett, who is trying to locate the mystical Flamel Stone aka The Philosophers Stone. With the help of some friends, Scarlett delves into the Catacombs in Paris on a quest to find the stone. The plot is unique and runs consistently throughout. Although aspects of it are far-fetched, there's also a logic with which the plot is presented that makes it feel feasible and even believable.What makes As Above, So Below so great is the atmosphere. It's eerie, mysterious, suspenseful and at times terrifying. I'm generally not a huge fan of found-footage, but it's executed so well that I can't grumble at it. It serves the exact purpose that found-footage should and makes the viewer feel that they're part of the events rather than a mere by-stander. The plot pulls you in from the first few scenes, but it does take its time to build to suspense and intruige. Despite building up slowly, it's well paced, consistent throughout and has a satisfying pay-off. It's not scary in the typical sense, with only a few jump scares, but the jump-scares that it does have are effective and well-timed. The setting is really what contributes to the effectivness of the atmosphere - it's dark and claustrophobic, and nobody truly knows dwells in the depths of the earth. Underground caves are a particular sore spot to me as someone that is terrified of the idea of being trapped underground, having to crawl through tight spaces, swim under water in a cave where I may not be able to find the surface, never being able to find light or air again. The only other horror I've seen that uses this setting so well is The Descent.Surprisingly, the acting was brilliant and the characters likeable. This is a rarity in horror which is over-saturated with mediocre acting and one-dimensional characters. The cast all deliver great and believable performances, and the characters are interesting and actually have personality. I genuinely rooted for them and wanted them to survive.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed As Above, So Below. It ticks all of the boxes for me and does everything I'd expect a good horror movie to do, and a little extra. The plot is pretty original for a horror, it's atmospheric, has a strong cast and likeable characters and was actually scary."

2. The tension and suspense in the build-up to Benji's (Edwin Hodge) death is done really well and sent shivers down my spine.
3. Perdita Weeks (Scarlett) and Ben Feldman (George) both give good performances.Cons:
1. Fran√ßois Civil (Papillon) and Hamid Djavadan (Reza) give very wooden performances.
2. There are a couple logical inconsistencies. For example, Benji films everything, even the things that are illegal. He does this whilst exclaiming about the illegality of those actions. Another example would be when the police somehow sneak up on the protagonists in the tunnel before they enter the catacombs.
3. The sound design is slightly off at points. For example, Papillon throws a smoke bomb on soil-laden Earth floor. Yet the sound that is emitted is that of a smoke bomb on a tiled floor.
4. George ends up in the catacombs unnecessarily just because he can't seem to say no to Scarlett.
5. The protagonists willingly follow La Taupe (Cosme Castro) even though he's clearly acting dodgy and mysterious. George even explicitly states he's leading them the wrong way, and Papillon concedes that La Taupe isn't acting himself. However, they all still follow him.
6. The characters of Zed (Ali Marhyar) and Souxie (Marion Lambert) are completely useless as they are given nothing to do with no character development to accompany it.
7. Most of the scares fall exceedingly flat.
8. Some of the cutting and editing are extremely obnoxious and annoying."

Subtle hints that they're at the gates of hell, the old piano from someone's childhood, the upside down and reversed settings. And then you have the ending which consisted of a few cheap jumpscares and a 1-minute ""confession"" session of demons the characters confront from their past. Then, they're back outside in the real world again. It left much to be desired. Also there was a scene where Papillion sees presumably an old friend in the car and says it wasn't his fault, we never receive any explanation or back story for this or for the girl from the nightclub appearing in the cave. I feel like a better way to end the story would be so that the character's are back outside but in an alternate reality proving they never escaped hell."

Fourth time, I put together things like her answering the phone, and her issue with her Dad, and the kid who told her to find Papillion is the kid in the flaming car... That's when I really got interested. Now, I'm at viewing number 6? Hang on, Papillion is about to die....brb, that was cool. Anyway, I'm reading about the connection to the Dante's Inferno as I watch, and I'm realising this may be one of the best films I've seen. It's definitely in a handful of my very favourites.

She is constantly talking, and her character is so into herself in the always right know-it-all kind of way that I think if she were real someone would've strangled her to death or hit her with their car in the real world by now. There's a lot of issues with this movie that make it . The first 10-ish minutes could've been shortened or cut entirely. Main character already shows how little she cares about those who help her in this time, as well as through the rest of the movie so it's really hard to like her. Can you spend an hour and a half watching a self-centered know-it-all Chatty Cathy? I also sighed in disappointment when the ancient scripts they translate somehow rhymes perfectly in English and the math is somehow in the measurement of feet. They saved ""scary"" bits for the last 20 minutes of the flick which involves a couple creepy elements and a couple random jump scares.

I wasn't able to suspend my disbelief. Too soon it brought in strange elements. The characters were facing significant moments of shame from their past, but everyone else could see and hear them too, like a shared dream. I half expected them to wake up from a nightmare at the end. I was bored, it wasn't scary except the claustrophobia feeling. The acting wasn't terrible, I just thought it was dumb and forced."
" Falls into nonsense
",-0.4019,-0.9693,2019-10-30 00:00:00,5,The first act of the film is engaging. I liked how the bread crumbs of the plot are laid out to follow. And the film makes nice use of historical/legendary elements. Unfortunately the film comes completely unglued about half way through. The script leans heavily into the irrationality of magick and horror. I guess the unpredictability was meant to be scary but it just bored me.The found footage conceit does not really makes sense here. Some of the footage of the film is lost in the film and the continuity issues are distracting. It also doesn't really help that the actors are all fairly crappy and *somehow* manage to mess up naturalistic tone the shooting style is going for.
" A Terrifyingly Effective Modern Horror

It has several predictable, but still very effective jumpscares. It starts out like a modern Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider found footage thriller, but it gets weirder and more bizarre once the story goes underground and into the supernatural.The movie has its share of exposition, but it never beats you over the head with it. This is a good mix of The Descent meets Indiana Jones meets Uncharted meets Baskin, and if you enjoyed any of those, you will love AASB. Its message was similar to Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain. An enthralling and unforgettable experience unless you're scared of tight spaces and graveyards. Claustrophobics, beware!"

The ONLY character that might continue going after all this is the lead chick- nobody else has any motivation to continue, and with each freaky thing that happens its more and more ridiculous that they would continue. I hate horror like this. Where the entirety of the story rests on poor writing. Instead of coming up with a reason why they dont say screw this im out- lets just make them continue on. People are not like that. Especially when there is nothing driving them. Treasure? Randomly promised by some stranger?  Any commentary on human fears, weaknesses or faults is made utterly pointless because the humans in the story are just shallow, poorly written/developed characters. There's no relatability, there's no ""hitting home"". And i find myself rooting for these idiots to die out of the frustration of their stupidity"

A lot of movies definitely miss the mark in making you truly feel like you are in the presence of something dark and inescapable, but As Above As Below gets it right. Overall definitely one of the better horror movies of the past few years."
" Wasted idea
",-0.4939,-0.9936,2019-07-25 00:00:00,2,"John Erick Dowdle, after a meh debut with Poughkeepsie Tapes, and the very disappointing follow ups that were the sh1tty Rec remake and the mediocre Devil, he proceded to make this film. And again, he didn't made a good film. This had so much potential that is sad how this ended.
This is based on Dante's Inferno, yeah, i'm not joking, a found footage flick is made up from one of the most important pieces of literature. And the premise itself of the movie is interesting. We follow a group of people, lead by a female alchemist scholar, that search for the philosofer's stone in the catacombs of Paris. It sounds dumb, but if you consider the ""source material"" and a enviroment we have never seen in a movie before, this could have been great. It's not because our characters are badly acted and uninteresting, we don't care about them, they make the stupidest decisions possible. And of course, this being a found footage movie, has to have no tension, and the only way that tries to scare you is by jumpscares, and very bad ones. The sound mixing and editing is horrible, the effects are awful, the dialogue is beyond nonsensical.
Ugh, this was very irritating. The 2/10 rating is only because the movie adaptates well the themes of the nine circles of hell, wich is kinda surprising considering how bad everything else. Hope the guy makes something decent, because I can tell he has some talent."

The tension is built with superb precision and if you're claustrophobic like I am, the horror will be ramped up for you."
" Terrible casting and shocking direction
",-0.7003,-0.296,2019-07-14 00:00:00,1,"Firstly your cast must be correct for the character. The lead is not in anyway believable, a professor 'seriously'. Based on this performance you wonder how she actually worked ever again, she ferrets around like a child on neat Kia-ora and pray she gets killed by a rabid stick insect with with a blunted whisk. Is it all her fault? Probably not, the director and script are shocking, it's meant to feel like a documentary piece with a covert camera in places etc, but it obviously feels nowt like it. There is just too much wrong with this film, you'll question everything, it happens from the start. The lead promptly says they have numerous PhD's, can speak numerous langages and dead one's but promptly cannot speak a language that would be wholly needed in their quest.
If it's on late at night and you're slightly squiffy from ale with a pizza or kebab then it'll be perfect for a laugh, otherwise just do not touch, it is awful."

Final Prayer (aka The Borderlands) is a similar found-footage horror that was a friction of As Above, So Below's budget but succeeds in being ferociously scary.

I remember scurrying through part of the catacombs beneath Paris and also getting lost in some labyrinthine chambers beneath the old castle in Budapest and this film vividly brought back the potential horrors. A bit of Blair Witch here and a lot of mumbo jumbo but also much convincing dialogue and the action, all within these narrow passage ways, tunnels and pools, is always ongoing. The initial urge to get going and keep going is maintained throughout and if there is some inevitable repetition, this too becomes part of the worry. Music is spot on and all in all a most memorable and scary ride I won't be rushing back to in a hurry."

All of the characters are brought to life with incredible acting, and I felt all types of emotions from their experience in this thrilling horror. I even got to the point where I had certain characters I PRAYED wouldn't die, and this film put me on an emotional roller coaster nearly killing off my favorite guy. George And Scarlett's relationship grew closer as their lives became more in danger, and I loved that. Of course, the whole time I thought ""They're going to kill him off-I know it!"" and it was a nail-biter watching George's near death when Scarlett practically left him and Zed to die.
I'm normally not one to shy away from ""scary scenes"" but there were a couple of moments I cringed and looked away, especially watching this after dark, and I can say that this film gave me the minimal jump scare, the excitement, the mystery, and the entertainment I was looking for.
I'd give it 10/10 except I'm not the biggest fan of POV movies with the shaky, first person camera. This is one of the only ones I could stand! Normally I'd get a headache and turn it off!"

" A fun Indiana Jones-esque found footage horror
",-0.1027,0.1735,2019-04-14 00:00:00,8,"As Above So Below never been credited as one of the better horror movies in the highly competitive found footage horror industry. The problem lies in many aspects; the acting, the screenplay, and ultimately the logic. However, during my first time watching this movie, it was an enjoyable experience, similar to REC, which the American remake also directed by the writer/director of this movie. As a disclaimer, this review is written after my second watching.Scarlett is an ambitious alchemist/archeologist that venture the world to seek the existence of the philosopher's stone after her father's suicide. After she found a clue in Iran, she, her ex-boyfriend George, and her cameraman Benji, along with a group who knows the underground of Paris, seek a journey of darkness and terror in the hidden passages of catacombs below Paris.While my initial response after the first time watching this movie was ""Terrific"", my second attempt proves that this movie is not quite as stellar as my memory remembers. This movie highly inspired by historical adventure plot that quite recycled in many elements, it's not a flaw, but I am surprised how this movie can be so predictable in terms of the plot. Although, I must say some of the jumpscares and the hallowing experience the group's having during their walk is creepy. The claustrophobic nuance is translated well by the found footage, something that can't be easily replicated (for example Levasseur's The Pyramid). And for I must say, while the jumpscares are not as much as you may expect in this kind of genre, the setting has its ways to help the lack of the ghost/scary things.What's the strongest point from this movie is the historical aspect from the plot that takes many real places/references that incorporated well, so that even though the logic isn't that good, the movie manages to be relatable, like how you experience Turteltaub's National Treasure. Even though, I have to admit how the screenplay builds Scarlett's character is quite annoying and feels unearthly and not original at all. I think having more a group's full of philosopher's stone's nerds explores the catacomb foolishly would be more fun rather than having some professionals risk their life too much without any rationale.As Above So Below has many things that able to be explored to be scarier, but they throw it without any notion after the second half (the girl following the group at the bar, the underground cult). Somehow it disintegrates the flow of the movie because they have enough material (like each of the group's members personal guilt) that already told. So why bother to add more unfinished/unexplained things in the first place?Nevertheless, As Above So Below is one of good experience to have in a found footage horror film that for most of the time, unable to give anything new other than being cheap. I am glad I watch this again, at least to confirm that although many reviewers underline the flaws too much, I find this movie an enjoyment that everyone should have without digest it seriously."

I gained a liking towards a lot of the main characters. Acting was also decent.Cons: I just didn't fully understand it, or the point of it. Without ruining the ending I thought it was just odd and pointless and gave no explanation whatsoever to what had happened the past 90 minutes.

I'm by no means a wimp but this film had me mesmerised and despite stopping it about 15 mins from the end, I did watch the last bit with the lights on just to finish it off.A horror film such as this gives you a sense of the cliche horror movie but there is more to this movie than the trailers and brief synopsis and, for me anyway, having to stop watching near the end means this film has done its job of scaring the living s*** out of you and being a top horror movie.That said, it isn't without its pitfalls but you will not be disappointed."

It's found footage, which is so oversaturated that I immediately got turned off in terms of being interested in the first scene. The logic also doesn't make sense. There's as well as continuity errors that really bugged me. The movie did get ok when it felt like National Treasure (2004), when the guy was fixing the tower bell and clues were being discovered. I also kinda liked the themes concerning the whole search for the treasure. The French guy is somewhat entertaining to watch. There was this also super creepy girl that got a decent scare.

I love the story line and found the acting and script to be above average. I think it's a movie that was seriously under-rated. A mix of some historical facts along with where people's minds will take them when put in frightening situations definitely puts this into one of my top 100 movies. There are a few ""yeah, right, that wouldn't have happened"" with some of the logical scenes. For example (** minor spoiler alert ahead **), when the group has rappelled down their 2nd hole, the least experienced person would never have been left at the top to be the final one to rappel (I am a retired climber and caver, which is also why I enjoy this movie). That decision had some serious consequences due to that characters lack of expertise in rappelling. That oversight in script is one of the things that irks me about the overall story line.For the most part, though, I love the movie. I would also love to see a follow-up movie made about an attempt to return to retrieve the dead bodies of those the group was forced to leave behind.

",0.5106,0.0736,2019-03-21 00:00:00,7,"Firstly, props to the writer for developing a strong female lead, in a film where most of the key male characters are too afraid of the unknown.Personally I really liked the beginning of this film. The 'Tomb Raider'/Indiana Jones/Da Vinci style quest was extremely interesting.
From here they fly to Europe after Scarlett narrowly avoids capture and cave-in, where they head into the French Catacombs.
This setting has been untouched within the horror genre and is ideal for this kind of storyline, however, the direction it goes in with the character's past mistakes coming back to haunt them was a bit weak."
" Unique, enjoyable, somehow
",0.4404,0.9418,2019-03-17 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't expecting much to be honest, as the whole found footage genre seems to have died a death, but this is surprisingly good. It begins in dramatic fashion, and for the most part doesn't let up, anyone that suffers with claustrophobia or a feeling of being trapped will appreciate the efforts of the film, or not. Some creepy scenes, I liked the part where the phone was ringing, that was atmospheric, as well as the push deeper into the cave. Perdita Weeks was excellent in the role.This was rather good. 7/10"
" very predictable and not scary!!!!!
",0.0,0.8358,2019-03-16 00:00:00,2,"Don't waste your time with this movie. if you like a little reality in your horror movies, this movie is not for you. the filming of this movie using the ""blair witch technique"" is okay, but seems to be done only this way to keep production costs low. right from the movies start, everything comes together way too perfectly, and this puzzle of the adventure falls into place the same way. the special effects in this movie are quite cheesy, and too many things happen during the journey that really don't make much sense. i never found myself scared during the movie, but just annoyed that what i was seeing was supposed to frighten me. the acting in general is not terrible, but definitely over the top in many points of the movie. you've been warned!!!"
" Not bad, not great, but hit the spot
",0.4164,-0.0379,2019-03-10 00:00:00,5,"Generally, I tend (try) not to watch anything with less than a 6.5 IMDB rating. However, on this occasion, I decided to give this 6.2 a go.I wasn't disappointed.The acting is actually quite good, script not bad, direction okay (although limited due to the subterranean catacombs setting) and the photography adequate. Although the film presented a reasonable interpretation/slant on the classic ""Dante's Inferno"", it was frustrating to be denied even an attempt at a final explanation for a satisfactory conclusion.You could argue that it spoke for itself in that the subjects eventually found redemption by turning their backs on Hell in forgiving themselves their lifetime follies. Nevertheless, at the end, some sort of insight into their post-inferno experience would have offered even a little resolution... perhaps as an 'epilogue'.Overall, though, despite some of the usual 'horror' clich√©d jumps (some different than the usual, and quite clever) I didn't pick out anything near the number of ridiculous goofs and flaws that I did in both ""The Descent"" movies (especially the second one).I've no choice but to say... I actually really enjoyed this movie. Therefore, although I think it justifies a 5.5, I'm awarding a 5.0 (as usual when I can't award part-marks, I err on the full lower mark)."
" Better than expected!

",-0.0772,0.862,2019-03-09 00:00:00,10,"Was looking for a good movie to watch and found it! The setting for the movie was great in the catacombs, the acting was good to the point it was believable for most of the movie. And there were a few parts that scared the hell out of us. That's what makes it great , I highly recommend checking it out."
" Nice surprise
",0.5994,0.6597,2019-03-02 00:00:00,7,"I put this movie on as a backround as i like having tv on when im doing something. I put this on coz it looked like b movie. In about half way i sat down and got hooked up. And it was quiet freaky , my heart jumped few time. Nicely done"
" Excellent idea - not the best execution.
",0.0854,-0.829,2019-03-02 00:00:00,6,"I have a soft spot for this film. The acting is generally fine, and the concept of traveling through the levels of hell in this way is unique, but the writing suffers from some typical horror cliches. Overall I'd say it's fun, and good for found footage, but not a great film."
" The Lara Croft Horror Film
",-0.5719,0.9765,2019-01-19 00:00:00,6,"I will fully admit when I saw the trailer for this I had no interest in seeing it. It just looked like another PG-13 found footage horror film. I would find out later that it was actually R Rated. But the premise didn't appeal to me either. A group of 20-somethings go spelunking in caves and get spoked. Nothing too attractive for me. I was on a horror movie website (at work) and an article came up about the film. (Unfortunately, I can't remember what site, otherwise, I would link the article here) I'm just gonna say to service this review the article I read was from Bloody Disgusting. I didn't want to go through the article because I didn't want to get spoiled. But this article had me rethinking my first thought of the film. And finding out that it was R Rated, I jumped online to give it a watch.As Above So Below shot found footage style by director John Erick Dowdle, follows Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) as she and a group of people venture into the catacombs in Paris looking for a specific artifact and treasure. What they come upon is something far more dangerous and dark. That's all I want to say about this plot because this film is best enjoyed cold. Don't read anything if you plan on seeing this. And definitely, do not watch the trailer. I'm so glad that I totally forgot about the film when I started watching it. It made the experience more enjoyable that way. Scarlett is joined on this expedition by a language expert George (Superstore's Ben Feldman), cameraman Benji (Cougar Town's Edwin Hodge) and a group of Parisian explorers.If there was a horror version of Tomb Raider this is it. Scarlett's drive to find this artifact is because of a death in the family. Her traits, looks, and storyline are very much on the same par with a one miss Lara Croft. She doesn't carry guns or fight of dozen of armed gunmen. The film also has an element of Indiana Jones. There are puzzles, riddles, and clues that the team need to decipher to get to their final destination. But let me tell you, none of them including me, did not see where this film was going. I can say that is a benefit of good filmmaking and decent storytelling.We are only given information through dialogue. If you don't pick up on something when it's said you might be confused further down the line. Key plot elements that maybe come back later are all revealed through the characters. The film has layers literal and figurative. And when it gets dark, it gets very dark. The performances help with sucking the viewer into the story. Perdita Weeks is the standout, feeling very much like a parallel to Lara Croft. When things happen you feel for her and she is not weak. The entire film for each character runs the gamut of emotions. There were times I was on the edge of my seat and times I was yelling at the screen.Sound design is key to a film like this. It's done well here. The filmmakers have made it so you feel lost and claustrophobic. There is no music other than music coming from the situation the group is in. Thankfully, John Erick Dowdle knows how to build tension. He doesn't place jump scare after jump scare. When they come they are well worth the wait. I will not lie, there were two of those moments that got me. One got me really good. Touche.My only issue is there is so much going on storywise, you don't really understand it all by the end of the film. Things happen in the story to certain characters because of certain things that happened in their past. We aren't explained that much. I don't want over explanation but I'd like a little more detail to fill in the characters as more three dimensional. For an adventure thriller with some horror, As Above So Below is a decent ride as a Lara Croft movie without the real Lara Croft. But for fans of layered films in their horror with some nice jump scares this is a good watch."
" One of the creepiest
",0.0,0.9914,2018-12-31 00:00:00,9,"I wanted to see this movie when it first came out years ago but I never got around to it. I looked at reviews and surprisingly a lot of them were negative. People were saying things like ""how can this girl have all this education at her age?"" blah blah and ""it's too religious"" blah blah. Despite all of that, I decided to judge for myself since I usually watch movies if they have over a 6 star rating.I was not disappointed. This movie had some of the best horror atmosphere I've seen. I felt the claustrophobia, I felt the menacing presences. It was like I was there. And I love how they set it all up without using jump scares at first because this way it wasn't cheapened from the get go. I genuinely was scared. I cared about what happened to the characters because we learned their personalities, their internal struggles. I especially love the Paris setting. It's creative and the parallel with the mythology and religious aspects were cool to see. I have never actually read Dante's Inferno but this movie and the explanations taught me a lot.The found footage genre was done well here. I think even though the 'expoloring deep cave' thing has been done before, this was more creative. In other movies, they encounter creatures but in this one the creatures manifest from the characters' minds. I really enjoyed it and I'd recommend it to horror lovers and those who want to feel what a creepy atmosphere is like."
" Brush up on your 14th-century lit ahead of time
",0.0,0.9345,2018-11-27 00:00:00,8,"First off, this movie is essentially a film adaptation of Dante's Inferno, so you'll probably enjoy it more if you do some googling before getting into it.That said, I thought it was a ton of fun regardless. It had some great scares and definitely lots of creepy moments.PS bring an inhaler if you're claustrophobic. You're welcome."
" The best found footage i ever seen in my life, othan than Unfriended...

" Cannot believe this movie received a low score
",-0.2732,0.5848,2018-11-18 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie a few years ago. I recorded it to watch later. Then, I watched it. I've watched this movie at least 10+ times. It's chilling. As of late, I have been looking at the reviews of a movie I'm about to watch, which is dumb. I finally looked at the reviews for this movie, and was dumbfounded. This movie is great, and although it doesn't happen so often, or maybe it does, the critics are wrong about this movie. Also, I'm a huge horror fan, but besides that the movie is labled ""horror"" I think it's a great movie, period!"
" Don't understand what the bad reviews are about
",-0.5423,0.979,2018-11-18 00:00:00,8,"I went in with zero expectations, but the film was better than expected. The beginning I felt was a little slow, but I understand it was needed for a little background info. Once inside the catacombs I felt like the film picked up quickly. The film contains some jump scares, but what I like is that it doesn't depend on them. Most of the movie builds up tension and anxiety of you anticipating what will happen next. I also don't understand why people are complaining about the camera work? This is a first person movie and I'm pretty sure if you were running through the catacombs, you wouldn't be holding the camera steady either. Plus no one said these people went to film school they are amateur camera men filming their experience in the catacombs, and I thought the shaky camera work added to the authenticity of the film. As for the ending, I thought it was original. I feel like there's so many movies like this that have the same ending over and over and this film strayed away from that. Overall I felt like this was a pretty good film and is worth a watch if you enjoy horror movies."
" You people are tripping
",0.0,0.7351,2018-11-01 00:00:00,9,...because this is the best handheld camera type of scary movie I've seen since Cloverfield. One of the best creepy films I've seen in some time.
" Why can't I be scared anymore?
",0.3412,-0.887,2018-10-24 00:00:00,6,"I grew up on horror movies, so I'm very jaded. Nothing ever scares me anymore, and I hate it. I guess it's like when a drug user gets used to their dose and has to keep doing a larger one. I'm that way with horror movies.That being said, this was decent, but not at ALL scary.If you want to actually watch a tense movie I highly recommend Grave Encounters. That one ACTUALLY freaked me out, so that should say something."
" Scary as hell!!
",-0.855,-0.7316,2018-10-20 00:00:00,10,"Very creepy and scary. You'll never look at the catacombs the same way! For a ""B"" horror film it's original and will give you nightmares. Not for the claustrophobic or the faint of heart."
" Terrible
",-0.4767,-0.8715,2018-10-17 00:00:00,1,Very bad film. It has so many horror movie cliches that I would not recommend this film to anyone. It also has some of the most contrived excuses for filming that I have ever seen.
" A decent found footage style film
",0.0,0.978,2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"This is mostly shot in a found footage style other than a few scenes at the beginning and end. Even those are done the same way, but not so much the shaky cam style that's so often prevalent in these films. I'm not a huge fan of that. It's always been something that I have a hard time watching because you can't focus on what's actually going on. I think maybe that's part of the appeal from a filmmaker standpoint, especially with lower budget films. When this started I groaned a bit and thought, here we go another one of these. I mentally began to prepare myself for another one of those films. I'm happy to say that wasn't the case and I liked this one quite a bit. While I didn't find it scary per say it was an interesting story. There's actually a good reason for it being shot the way it is and I thought the acting was fairly solid. The pacing is good. I never once found myself getting bored. I was glued to what was going on. This had a very claustrophobic feel to it. In many ways, it reminded me of the movie The Cave, only done way better. (The Cave missed so many chances to be effective) I'm glad I randomly decided to throw this one on. Not something I would revisit often, but at the very least an enjoyable watch.My Rating: 6/10"
" A very good found footage type film
",0.4927,0.98,2018-10-09 00:00:00,8,"I am not a huge fan of the whole wearing a camera type film and recording what the characters see film. This film was first popularized by the godawful Blair Witch Project. Sorry, I thought that film was total trash as it showed you nothing and people are telling me that you need to use my imagination...I counter, a movie is a visual medium and thus I should expect to see something other than three idiots cussing in the woods with them hearing something I couldn't and freaking out. This one was much better, but sadly did not make the money that one did, despite having a superior cast, a superior story and they actually showed you something! Add to those three things a super great setting and atmosphere! The story has a young woman who is searching for clues on the whereabouts of the philosopher's stone. She has it pinpointed in these catacombs of Paris, which actually exist and look creepy as heck! She is pointed to a man who knows the catacombs well and soon they are entering a section that is not open to the public. Within these catacombs things start to happen as they have to enter a section where it is said no one returns. Strange phones, pianos and a man who has been missing awhile make their appearance while the group progresses ever deeper into the catacombs trying to escape!The setting in this one is the real star. I honestly would love to explore a place like that; however, only if there was no danger, which is never going to be the case so I live vicariously through the actors in movies such as these. I kept enjoying their descent into this nightmarish world underneath Paris and kept wondering what they would find next!So I enjoyed this film a lot. I would have enjoyed it more, but the film did have a couple of flaws making it not as good as it could have been. I would have loved for them to be in the caves longer as I loved watching them in this area. I hated when the young woman had to backtrack because I had seen all the stuff in that area, I wanted more areas! I also wish I had seen a bit more as there were a couple of things I missed due to the shaky camera you get in a film such as this. I would have enjoyed the movie even more had it been your basic movie as that setting would be hard pressed to be topped!"
" Interesting premise
",0.4019,0.8649,2018-10-07 00:00:00,7,This movie has an interesting premise and an interesting story and isn't all bad for a found footage movie but it is overly confusing at some points which may not be a deal breaker for some but just now it will require some thought to understand but the more you think of it the more it falls apart as a movie some things also just don't make any sense at all but there are some interesting concepts in the movie like how it's just about people dealing with guilt but the ending seems like a cop out ending and that they didn't know how they were going to finish it
" Just ok.
",0.296,-0.7972,2018-10-06 00:00:00,5,"I didn't care for some of the 'Blair Witch' camera work. It was ok in some scenes and I guess it sort of fit, however, it is just unpleasant to watch sometimes.There was really no rhyme or reason for why some characters died and others survived which was a bit irritating.The end was really abrupt and non-conclusive which was a bit of a disappointment. I rather liked most of the story until it sort of fell apart at the end."
" Seriously the worst horror movie I've ever seen.
",-0.8591,0.9852,2018-10-05 00:00:00,2,"This movie had so much potential to be really good. And yet.... 
I don't even know where to begin. So the concept was great, catacombs leading to a secret treasure, great. But there are just so many storylines they don't tie up at the end. Is there a cult that lives underground? Are we just not going to talk about the dusty phone and childhood piano down there? Is it the gates of Hell? Is it just the stone playing tricks on them? Also, for a good laugh, I recommend the ""chomping teeth on the floor"" scene. Honestly, what were they going to do, bite her feet until she died? Also- when you translate something from Aramaic into English, IT WONT RHYME IN ENGLISH. All in all, my roommates and I had a pretty good time making fun of this movie, but it's realoy better on paper than it is as finished product."
" Frightening descent into the abyss
",-0.4939,0.9563,2018-10-02 00:00:00,8,"A group of explorers decide to investigate a series of catacombs underneath the city of Paris, France in search of treasure. However, their journey underground becomes a hellish ordeal when they are forced to face their personal demons. Director John Erick Dowdle, who also co-wrote the compact script with Drew Dowdle, takes time to develop the characters, relates the compelling story at a steady pace, and adroitly milks plenty of claustrophobic tension and spooky gloom-doom atmosphere from the creepy actual catacombs location. Moreover, this film acquires considerable unsettling power not only from the way it slowly, but surely becomes more bleak, brutal, and nightmarish as the plot unfolds, but also from the inspired and effective use of eerie ambient noise. The sound acting from the capable cast rates as another substantial asset, with especially praiseworthy contributions from Perdita Weeks as the eager Scarlett, Ben Feldman as reluctant translator George, Francois Civil as brash guide Papillon, Edwin Hodge as surly cameraman Benji, and Ali Marhyar as the easygoing Zed. Leo Hinstin's hand-held cinematography gives this picture a raw and bracing sense of intimacy and immediacy. A genuinely harrowing film."
" More deep than expected
",0.0,-0.9962,2018-09-30 00:00:00,7,"Excuse the intended pun.I was expecting this to be a ""boo!"" horror slasher flick with stupid drunk college kids exploring some underground tunnels beneath some city who run afoul of zombies there.It isn't.Movie opens with adventurer's daughter Scarlett sneaking into Iran, disguised, to find the Rosetta Stone of alchemy. She is charismatic, driven, demanding and basically selfish and overbearing to the people who she goes to for help.The search through the underground Iranian tunnels is a good example of her character. Literally right before armies of the local faith bomb the tunnels, she finds what she is looking for. Then she puts her guide friend who had helped her in danger from both the authorities and the bombing as he frantically tries to take her back to safety. But she refuses to budge, until he's practically begging her to think of his family before she relents and let's him go. Yeah, she's not a nice person.She escapes with the information she needs and as she's retracing her steps in the tunnels, in the chaotic explosions that stun and disorient her, strangely she sees a man hanging by the neck above her in the tunnel, still struggling. She stops to say 'hello' as the man's body turns to her. Explosions happen, she turns and runs and never says anything to anyone about this vision.Cut to Paris. She is being interviewed by a documentarian who starts to film her adventure. She realizes she needs help translating the museum tablet inscription that the Rosetta stone inscription interpreted for her. She knows multiple languages but Aramaic is not one of them. She recruits her clock repairing ex boyfriend George who translates the table for her. It will tell her where the Philosopher's Stone is buried in Paris. That is what she's looking for. 
Per the inscription the stone is buried 300 or so feet below the streets near the catacombs in unofficial and unmapped tunnels. Given a tip by a strange young man seen briefly on a guided tour through the regular catacombs, she locates a trio of French adventurers Papillon, Zed and Siouxie who have explored the uncharted areas of the catacombs (having been there, yes, it appears just as claustrophobic as it appears in the film, especially if you are tall) in a French nightclub. There is a strange woman who exits the club as they are entering, then is caught on the documentarian's camera circling the club, staring at the group but this is ignored and never brought up again.They succeed in getting down to the secret entrance to the catacombs where things immediately start to go wrong. Accosted by the police right before they enter, the three French spelunkers throw smoke grenades and escape into the tunnels, dragging along Scarlett's ex boyfriend George who had adamantly refused to go with her on this trip due to an earlier trauma.The group reaches a fork in the tunnels after passing a weird chorus cult of women singing by candlelight in an ante chamber. They keep singing their strange song, unnerving the group. The spelunker leader Papillon says he knows the way via a pile of bones heaped under a crawlspace near the ceiling. The documentarian Benji balks at crawling over bones. Papillon insists that it's the way to go. Scarlett sees a perfectly good tunnel to their right that is partially sealed whose path she traces on her map would cut hours off their trip. Papillon adamantly refuses to go that route, and tells the tale of people who have gone that way who have never come back. He relates the tale of a man named Le Taupe who lived down in the catacombs for years. Then he could no longer resist the siren call of the cursed path, and finally left to explore it. That was 2 years ago and no one has seen him since. Scarlett thinks it's silly, but relents and follows Papillon and the others by the other route. They squeeze through but Benji gets stuck, panics and after a while - the scene goes on much longer than it should, but it gives you time to feel Benji's desperation and irritation at Scarlett's nagging voice - is able to struggle through, but causes a roof collapse.Now things start to get weird.They escape the collapse and find themselves right back where they started. Papillon is freaked out saying this is not where they should be. He explains that they should be in a straight tunnel after passing through the crawlspace but they're not. Undaunted by this strangeness, Scarlett says they have no choice now but to continue using the tunnel that no one returns from. And so they enter.They don't run into zombies or crazy men with knives or weird cannibal troglodytes, but they keep having disturbing experiences and each level forces them further and further down. After I watched the movie, I read the reviews and realized this was a modern version of Dante's Inferno. The seekers are basically descending into Dante's hell and each of the group are tested and either punished or not.I'm glad I watched this film as it is head and shoulders above most horror type movies lacking slashers, gore and fornicating teenagers. But I do admit, never having read Dante's Inferno, that I completely missed the references and 3 levels before the end, I grew impatient with the constant tunnel travel and hit my fast forward button. It ends much like Dante's Inferno does, surprising me yet again as I hadn't caught the reference and doesn't resort to cheap gotchas afterwards. I do recommend it and the real Paris catacombs (they did film this movie there)."

It simply isn't trying to be anymore than what it is... a 90 minutes scare fest with a slight historical background thrown in. I found it to be equally terrifying and entertaining. I hate small spaces so it really challenged me to watch this, and I liked that they played off that fear that many have. The movie made me feel something, and that's what I aim for when evaluating a movie. (Not speaking of feeling of hatred either toward said movie) But I really think it was worth a watch, and I had very low expectations going into it. Just remember going into it what the movie is, and don't overthink beyond that. Not trash, but also not an Oscar nominee. It's just a good ole fashion fright fest. Enjoy it!"
" Much better than expected

The only reason I kept going in this movie was because of the lead actress, and I'm glad I didn't stop.The movie itself is gripping and somewhat original, well thought out and the fact that it was filmed in the actual catacombs adds a quality to it that a set couldn't compare to. I wouldn't consider it SCARY, I rarely find movies to be scary though, but it was still very entertaining. I can honestly say I loved every moment of it."

I've been watching horror movies since before I really should have been. So I've seen all types of flicks, n rarely been startled at all. N for the record I hate most found footage or shaky camera films but not this one. This movie works on so many levels. N the first person view really helps to trap u in the characters world. I even found myself feeling a bit claustrophobic despite being in a well lit and open room. Kudos to the production team for that one. Did it terrify me no, did I jump...HELL YES. N I rarely jump during even the best movies. Would I recommend this movie...also HELL YES!! I look forward to finding it on Blu-ray so I can watch my friends reactions to the movie. I did enjoy the other movies from sams film team such as quarantine. But this movie dwarfs quarantine by far. Haven't enjoyed a horror movie this much since I was a kid. Great acting, great writing, subjects I'm interested in. Yeah there is some CGI but not much. And what little CGI there is really works well w the film. If I could give it more than ten stars I would. I finished the movie about 15 min ago n I'm still wicked pumped. Unless ur really claustrophobic I highly recommend this film.

A clue from Iran leads her to believe the Stone is somewhere in or around the Paris catacombs. She enlists the help of a reluctant ex-boyfriend George (Ben Feldman) for his skills in Aramaic. He then ends up going along for the whole trip. They need help for the more remote areas of the catacombs, so they hire three guides, played by Francios Civil, Marion Lambert, and Ali Marhyar. Unfortunately, Benji (Edwin Hodge) a videographer making a documentary about Scarlett, also comes along. I say this not due to anything about Hodge's performance, which was solid. No, I say it because a documentary-maker on the expedition could only mean the rest of the movie would be in shaky-cam. And man, was it. ""As Above, So Below"" is ruined by the old shake 'n' quake gimmick. This isn't even a horror cliche. It's just a mistake. What's worse, there was a time that Scarlett is alone without Benji or anyone else to agitate the camera at her. For once I thought I'd be able to follow what was going on. Wrong. The camera was attached to her for more jolting and jittering and even less visual coherency.The movie only has a $5mil budget. So, most of the thrills in the dark never rise above the Halloween haunted house level. These are mostly leering weirdos and creepy sounds that never come to a coherent cause. If the shaky cam is used to obscure poor makeup jobs, then it works. However, cheesy masks than motion sick. Weeks character spends most of her underground time trying to interpret ancient verse, which strangely enough rhymes in direct translation from Aramaic. That, more than anything else, should have alerted Scarlett that there was some bad magic afoot. The acting was more solid than usual for a low-budget horror movie. This makes a few awful lines bearable. Weeks performance as Scarlett lifts the rest of the movie. So, it isn't a complete loss. I don't know how anyone prepares to watch for watching a shaky cam movie, but if you don't mind the jerking and jarring, you can mark my rating up three stars."

" Here we go
",0.0,-0.9949,2018-09-02 00:00:00,5,"This movie is all over the place in both crazy, interesting, and just plain stupid.The crazy: So here we have two characters in there early to mid-twenties. Somehow the girl has 2 Ph.Ds and speaks six languages fluently. The guy can translate languages that have been dead for hundreds of years in a matter of seconds. The interesting: The movie is basically a symbolic runoff of Dante's Inferno. Going through the Nine Circles of Hell, going through hell to get out of hell, etc. This part is interesting, but when watching the movie for the first time it is extremely confusing. In fact, it was so confusing I had to look up what the movie was actually about. The Stupid: The majority of the movie rests here in the stupid section. We have multiple scenes that stuck out to me in particular. Such as the car on fire. The man is dragged into the fire by nothing and then is seen only with his legs dangling while the rest of his body is underground. Yes I understand they are in hell, but this is just so stupid. Next we have the stone. A one-time use stone that can heal anything and apparently bring people back to life. And then the main character realizes that ""she is the stone"". Do you understand how stupid that phrase sounds?Overall, this movie was an extremely good representation of hell. However, it is so confusing and some parts are so unrealistic and stupid that I myself was heard just laughing at the sheer stupidity of the writers. My rating originally started at a 3/10 but I increased it to 5/10 after reading the symbolism of the movie."

" Pretty fair ""Found Footage"" Horror/Suspense film with obvious (but forgiveable) flaws
",0.6705,0.9915,2018-06-07 00:00:00,7,"All right, I just have have to get this out of the way up front: Professional archaeologist and her experienced catacomb-spelunking expedition companions go on an exploratory trip into the unknown depths of the Paris catacombs...and they don't bring GLOVES ??? With that out of the way, my other complaint is that most of the illusions/hallucinations/traps that came to life to bedevil our heroes and heroines were pretty flat and unconvincing. Maybe there needed to be a bit more backstory for the characters in the party, or maybe the art direction and design (which probably looked pretty good on the storyboards) needed a little more polish and revision. Whatever, with very few exceptions, the revenants and wraiths just weren't scary in and of themselves. I sort of had to persuade myself that the characters would find them convincing.And this isn't really a complaint, but the movie just had more ideas and subplots than it knew what to do with, leaving a lot of the suggestions and subplots unresolved or unanswered. It's seems possible that a lot of material got left on the cutting room floor as the editors tried to keep the movie from being over long and too hard to watch. That sure beats the alternative of thin plots being stretched out too far or editors having to pad the film with extraneous junk, but it's still a problem. Now, in its favor: the movie got a lot of things right. Unlike most similarly themed movies, the screenplay incorporated many of the classic Grail, Inferno, and alchemical mythic tropes, which lent it a lot of oomph for people who are up on those things (so it's as much suspense as it is horror). Unlike ""Tomb Raider"", the protagonists are not larger than life icons whose safety and survival are guaranteed (which ramps up the tension and uncertainty). The sense of claustrophobia, creepiness, and isolation as the expedition ventures further and further down the rabbit hole with no way back, is very well done. The actors are attractive, interesting, and likable (except maybe for the character of ""Zed"", who doesn't seem to have much purpose other than to fill out the party and doesn't have a lot to say or do that any other character could have done.) So: worth watching if you enjoy this sort of thing. Different enough (with its mythical themes and ideas) from the typical monster or revenant movie to feel fairly fresh. Fairly well acted, with a lot of energy at times, and a good sense of suspense for most of the movie. I liked it enough to purchase a copy of it after I rented it."

" Tomb Raiding in Dante's Inferno
",0.0,-0.9366,2018-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Saw this on cable several years ago (I'd never heard of it) and liked it enough to buy it. Re-watched it last night and decided to review it. Really good for what it is: a modestly-budgeted B-grade horror flick in an exotic location.Best reason to watch this movie: The catacombs. Seeing all those real skulls and bones is fantastically creepy. They've got to crawl through little tunnels clogged with human bones, digging through them to make space. Real skulls are embedded in the walls in patterns as decoration made by people hundreds of years ago. Knowing that they were the remains of dead people rather than props gave me an eerie feeling.Another reason to watch: If you've ever read ""Dante's Inferno"", you'll find plenty of references and symbolism to pick through. I had fun doing that. It made me want to learn a bit about alchemy too.Premise: A Lara Croft-type hires / convinces / drags three climbers, a cameraman, and her ex-boyfriend down into a secret passage in the Parisian catacombs to find the Philosopher's Stone. Things get supernatural really fast and everybody on the trip has some personal demon or sin they have to face, which often turns literal and actually kills some of them. But that's what happens when you literally go to Hell.The shaky cam footage gets tiring. There's an actual reason to film the movie this way: the characters illegally enter the catacombs on an exploration mission. (Plus, imagine trying to fit a camera crew down there.) Nevertheless, I wished they'd hold still for a minute.The characters? Scarlett has 4 PhDs, speaks 6 languages fluently, and has a black belt... and is under 30. Sure. Her ex-boyfriend can translate centuries-old Aramaic off of dimly-lit stone tablets and fixes church clocks in his spare time. Whatever. These revelations might have been a cue to not take this movie completely seriously. The cameraman and the three climbers didn't get much backstory, but what happens down in the cave gives you enough clues to guess about Papillon's and Benji's.The horror? It started out as creepy and tense, but once they get deeper into Hell, things went nuts. Then there were more jump scares, and one scene-I'll just say it involves fire-put it over the top for me and killed the creepy vibe that the first part of the movie had. By then, things are moving so fast, that you can't spend that much time on it and have to focus on the next horrible thing that's happening. Even after this tone-shift, I was still enjoying the movie.The puzzles and traps? There were some cool ones. Lots of collapsing ceilings and puzzle clues that relied on some sort of alchemy mumbo-jumbo. The archeologist usually solves them pretty quickly, but there are consequences the few times she doesn't. The end has some interesting symbolism to it, and might be a little corny, but it's not out of place given everything that just happened.So it's not ""The Descent"" or ""Paranormal Activity"" but I did find it entertaining enough to watch multiple times. I'll brush up on my Dante, check out some alchemy lore and watch it again.Film recommendation: ""Inferno"" (1980) by Dario Argento. It's not an adventure movie and the story makes less sense, but it has killer atmosphere. If you want more truly creepy stuff even better the beginning of AASB, check it out."

The found footage aspect makes it all the more realistic and appealing, which really draws you into the movie more. I stumbled across this movie randomly, as I was searching for another fixation to my supernatural/horror movie addiction and was more than pleasantly surprised. Some of my other favorites include Oculus, The Exorcist, and the Insidious series. Movies that focus on the supernatural that also present an intense psychological twist. As Above So Below really personifies the supernatural element while also bringing a historical aspect to it, making it all the more real. Overall I highly recommend and wish they would make a sequel or more movies like this."

Basically in Iran in Aramaic, young alchemy scholar Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) discovers a riddle on the head stone of Nicholas Flamel, the alchemist believed to have discovered the Philosopher's Stone, and finds a rose key that may help her to find the historical stone. The tombstone riddle pinpoints the location of the Philosopher's Stone as being in Paris, France, she travels there, meeting up with her former boyfriend George (Ben Feldman) and her cameraman Benji (Edwin Hodge). They conclude that the stone is below the Parisian Catacombs, with their guide Papillon (Fran√ßois Civil); his girlfriend Souxie (Marion Lambert); and their friend Zed (Ali Marhyar), they go into the deep uncharted tunnels. But the explorers get more than they bargained for, when they do find the stone and remove it, they are trapped in the hellish underground maze, with demonic visions and chambers collapsing on them. One by one, team members venture too far, and suffer bloody deaths, until only Scarlett, George and Zed are left, and they realise that the only way out, strangely, is to go down, as seen earlier on a Gnostic Star of David, an artefact symbolising the notion ""As above, so below"". Eventually the remaining survivors find what appears to be a manhole cover above them, they jump through it, and find themselves the right way up on the streets of Notre Dame, they are now safe. The story is inspired by Dante's Inferno stuff, and the film is presented as a ""found footage"" movie, there are some reasonable gory and Blair Witch style apparition moments that keep you interested, it is not the scariest thing you will watch, but it's not a bad horror.

This movie was drop-dead AMAZINGLY accurate and the more the director took it as far as he did the more I was terrified. Think about it; You're watching a horror movie and all of the facts in the movie are true and from real recorded WORLD history. Just about every single turn of events was at a pivotal moment with a real, historically accurate twist. Amazing acting, amazing direction-NOT a ""found footage"" movie because the footage was never lost in the first place and I seriously can never get enough.

Information she has found indicates that it is buried within the Paris Catacombs, and her and her small group must head underground to find it.The characters in this film are a mix of strong and weak. At some parts of the film, they can be strong, at others, they're just pathetically weak. The characters just aren't relatable at all and they're annoying at most points during the film. Scarlett was determined, but in deadly proportions and honestly, everyone in this film should have died with her lead.As Above, So Below is different. It was original in some tones ‚Äì the Paris catacombs, the plot line of the film and the characters themselves, but also, it was just boring. It was a good mix of excitement and pure boredom.

" Good actors; realistic dialogue; avoids most clich√©s; some irritating camera-work/old-hat effects
",-0.2648,0.9743,2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"I'm actually pretty impressed with this film, for what it is! Ultimate takeaway: an attention-holding flick for folks who enjoy character-focused horror-lite (like me) and don't want a pure repeat of something they've seen before-- and not for people looking for a start-to-finish gore-fest. The conversational dialogue is realistic, and the actors' expressiveness is on point. How often do horror directors exert the patience and wisdom to let the film breathe, with pauses and (semi-)realistic pacing, and the script writers and horror actors show the chops and patience to communicate through normal everyday banter, pauses, interruptions, and silent expressions? Usually there's a lot of rushing-on-to-the-next-canned-line and giving-blank-stares or over-the-top- exaggerated-grimaces (although there was some of that once we got to the 'scary' parts of the film). I was genuinely impressed by the lead actors in this one, to the point that I'd like to see them succeed in more mainstream cinema/TV. They each had a presence I'd enjoy seeing again (I'm thinking Scarlett, George, and Papillon). The setup is patient, and really allows you to settle in to the characters (even if, as other reviewers have pointed out, they're a little unrealistically 'perfect', what with their multiple degrees and multi-language fluency and 'Krav Maga' skills, on top of their youth and runway-model good looks) and hand-held-camera documentary ambiance before revealing a premise that I otherwise might have bailed on immediately (they're looking for the ""Philosopher's Stone""? Really?) It is a credit to the dialogue writers, director, and actors that they carried this premise without reverting to a complete cheese-fest. Another credit to the script and direction: When warned of a dangerous mystery tunnel from which no one ever returns... the crew doesn't go in! Of course, a plot contrivance forces the crew to enter later anyway (I barely feel like that's a spoiler: this is a horror movie)... but still! It's through legitimate forced-choice, not arbitrary character recklessness.In general, there was increased predictability and clich√© once they got into the doom-tunnels. Protagonist girl has amazing catastrophe-proof makeup; characters fall into a couple obvious traps; predictable jump scares ensue. Camera shots constantly cutting to black and jumping around in a way that the headlamp cameras surely shouldn't. Within the world of this universe, I was left curious about how far the reach of the supernatural forces is supposed to go. Usually, there's a barrier past which horror movie characters have to stumble-- a 'misstep' that warrants everything that happens next. But in this film, the characters make the correct (first) choice; they stay on a path that at least some of them have already traveled many times before. And yet they end up forced, by supernatural intervention, into the hell dimension anyway. In fact, elements of the hell dimension have already appeared aboveground well before the characters even embark on this exploration (e.g. the staring girl outside the club). Was the doom just inevitable? If they hadn't gone underground in Paris, would the club bathroom have just transported them to the hell dimension instead? I was left wondering about the actual mechanisms and phenomena we were watching on screen-- but not necessarily in a way that made me feel the movie 'cheated'; more like, there was more to discover than what we actually saw (since it wasn't all laid out for us in exposition). Ultimately, I was pleased and found the overall quality relatively fresh and professional for the genre. There were a few heavy-handed moments, I didn't like the cameras constantly cutting to black, and I wasn't altogether impressed with the horror-specific effects (except for the demise of the first character-- wow. Simplicity is definitely the way to go, in my view) but for the most part they avoided over- explaining everything (and I think leaving the audience with a few questions to ponder can be a good thing).Not necessarily a classic, but I think there's a lot of good stuff to appreciate in here, for folks like me who watch a lot of horror movies on Netflix! Based on this film, I'd be genuinely interested in seeing what else this director, and the 3 lead actors, come out with."
" Stopped watching 10 minutes in
",-0.2263,0.7494,2017-02-27 00:00:00,3,"Really?? Translation from Ancient Aramaic script on a tombstone found in Paris produces perfect rhyming and rhythmic riddle in modern English? Maybe there is a logical explanation, but at that point I'm afraid I couldn't be bothered to find out... :-( The main characters were very young, but possibly plausible, but the fact the right chemicals were immediately to hand to reveal a secret key just all seems too far fetched"
" Originality and style are lost in the haze of nausea-inducing camera-work
",-0.3182,0.9652,2017-02-17 00:00:00,5,"As Above, So Below is a survival-horror video game I would have loved to play. In fact, as I watched it, I couldn't help but wish that someone would adapt it for the much more suitable genre.The film's premise and basic plot are intelligent enough to enjoy, and as usual the blend of ancient mythologies in a ""relic-hunt"" (as per Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider) is something I would have liked to explore more fully. Unfortunately since this is a feature film that had to enclose its dose of jump-scares and shaky-cam, it set up a great first act and then proceeded to dash it thoroughly with standard horror-movie tropes for the entire rest of its run-time. The actors are adequate but their characters unoriginal, and as with all ""found-footage"" films there are multiple instances in which the camera/cameraman are shoehorned back into the plot so that the footage can continue to be created. The film was shot on location in the catacombs of Paris, and I am deeply sorry that we did not get more solid camera-work of this unique and fantastic location. Opportunities wasted make me peeved, and as such I could not quite settle in for the mediocre B-Horror that is this film...."
" A good idea that ended up ruined.
",-0.0516,-0.9196,2017-02-05 00:00:00,4,"This low-budget film starts from a promising premise: the legendary quest for the Philosopher's Stone, allegedly discovered by a medieval alchemist, Nicholas Flamel. However, the whole story is based on a script so ambitious that it ends up being its own enemy. One of it most obvious mistakes is to arbitrarily mix historical elements, such as the unlikely link between a medieval pseudo-scientist (who, at most, would know some Latin) and a Persian stone tablet in Aramaic, an absolutely unknown language in medieval Europe. The use of Paris catacombs as a movie location was an excellent move, adding value and interest to the film but, despite the gloomy atmosphere, it failed to create tension. The scares repeat themselves, successfully, but nothing more. There is no real fear or suspense. The use of an old kabbalistic axiom (as above so below) is determinant for the plot and the end of the film, always having in mind the words and their meaning (difficult to understand for those who are not fans of the occult). Perdita Weeks is the lead actress and does a fairly reasonable job, but the rest of the cast does not help. Cinematography is bad, but I think it was purposeful because it's supposed to be a found-footage or something based on unedited recordings."
" Found footage horror meets Indiana Jones
",-0.5719,0.9915,2017-01-30 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a huge fan of documentary style ""found footage"" movies, I prefer the traditional way where the camera ""doesn't exist"", so I wasn't initially too excited to watch this, but decided to give it a go as the rating was quite high.Positive things first. It's a good movie, I have to say that. It's basically very well made, very good story and even tho I'm not a huge fan of the style, it was well made. There are some genuinely creepy moments and the few fx scenes were quite creative. The script and story were really interesting, it wasn't just dumb teens lost in the catacombs, but there actually was a Indiana Jones style story. I can't say if the story was water proof or just pseudo-smart, but it provided enough beef for the movie to be interesting. It felt as if the writer(s) had actual interest in the subject.The negative things then. The shooting style wasn't my favorite, I can't help it, but I just felt this had been an amazing movie had it been shot traditionally. Having said that the style itself worked quite well, if you're into it. I don't know if the cameras would've survived everything they went through in the movie, but it worked quite well in the end. The other gripe I have is the acting, combined with the style it felt a bit unintentionally goofy at times. Kind of like the style they used in The Office (deliberately), people not quite sure whether they should look at the camera or not, awkward moments etc.There are some elements in the movie which don't make much sense or aren't really explained (the ""cult"", the phone, the story of La Taupe etc..), but they do add to the creepiness.All in all a positive experience tho, especially liked the inspired and Indy style story, quite unusual for this kind of horror movie."
