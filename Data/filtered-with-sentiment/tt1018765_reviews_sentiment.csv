" Don't let politicians fool you!
",0.4015,-0.9062,2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"It's election time in Bolivia. The usual. Dirty laundry exposed, dirty tricks, dirty lies. The duo de Almeida/Bullock is an improbable one, yet explosive. You watch the wick burn, and as it reaches the dynamite stick....
A reverse Taming of the Shrew, or so she thinks, until she finds out he had her since the beginning.
IMHO, some scenes could have been trimmed."
" SANDRA BULLOCK IS LET DOWN BY THIS FILM
",0.0,-0.34,2020-03-26 00:00:00,1,"I love Sandra Bullock but she is so let down by this script.
Also the pace of the film is dire."
" One of the worst movies of Sandra
",-0.6249,0.8248,2020-01-28 00:00:00,4,"A waste of talents of a good cast.
I tried to watch it along and hoped the movie to get better but turned the TV off.
The rate for the movie is better than it deserves."

" Top notch political drama
",0.2023,0.9507,2019-04-26 00:00:00,8,"We watch movies to see parts of the world we are never likely to visit. Or at least I do. Our Brand Is Crisis is brilliant in this regard. We see lots of Bolivia, filmed really well, both inside and outside the cities. Top notch acting makes this production highly engaging. There are a number of surprises. It's fresh and not over the top. It doesn't stray into comedy or farce. This is another Sandra Bullock vehicle that emphasises her abilities. Her ups and downs ,her wit and resourcefulness, make for an enjoyable ride. Billy Bob Thornton is also impressive. There's a fine cast along with them. This is a well polished movie regardless of whether it relates a true story or not."
" Not what I call easy to get into.
",-0.3412,0.0378,2019-04-16 00:00:00,6,I'm gonna be generous and at least pass this movie with a 6 because this movie was little hard to get into. Movies have to have at least a 6 in order to pass first time round. You got two candidates trying to run for president in Bolivia. There's corruption and violence. And then you got the rich snobs. And the wannabe Mexicans. And what happened with George Clooney. The only reason to see this film is you got the longtime Billy Bob Thornton. But take a word for it.
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.34,2019-02-24 00:00:00,9,External blink on the US conducting political business-as-usual. Relevant to all outside the US giving a perspective we are not familiar with.
" Utlimately a Real Mind-Bender
",0.0,0.9901,2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"31 October 2015. It will be really, really difficult to rate this movie with only one viewing, it's that ultimately mind-bending. This movie really isn't what one most likely expected going into the movie. It's not a Sandra Bullock comedy, forget Miss Congeniality (2000) or All About Steve (2009). Nor is this a serious, serious dark drama Sandra Bullock, no Crash (2004) here. In a small way, this is serious but wry and for the most part dry Sandra Bullock of 28 Days (2000) but behind the scenes of politics movie. Yes there is humor like the movie trailer implied, but for the most part its about what goes on behind the scenes in winning and losing elections, think Robert Redford's The Candidate (2002).What is really appealing about this movie is the cerebral and sly comedy setting tone for the actual drama taking place here. The movie is awash of cynicism and yet principle somewhere if one digs far enough. As for mind-bending, it is comes at the end of the movie in which it is displayed what this movie is really about. For some it may come as a huge disappointment looking at the near zero ratings. For others, it looks like it really manages to become a real true hit. Many great movies oftentimes end up with love or hate results.In the end, this political drama as I describe this movie is entertaining for the higher functioning along with a sobering and important Sandra Bullock message for the upcoming American national election next year. If this movie is as good or better on a second viewing, this movie would definitely be a very good movie that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney should be proud to have produced even though it looks like it isn't going to make a lot of money."
" Crass and Crude look at third world electioneering
",-0.5719,-0.9352,2018-05-24 00:00:00,4,"""Our Brand is Crisis"" has some slight value. It's portrayal of the chaos in the elections of many third world countries comes very close to what one often sees in the news. The focus of this film, though, is on the paid professionals and teams who work on the strategies for campaign publicity, politicking and vote getting. Watching this film, one has a sense of the Hessians who were the hired professional soldiers who served and fought during the colonial days for Great Britain. Like the Hessians before them, these pol-pros don't care about the people. Nor do they necessarily have to care for their candidate. They are in the game for one thing - to win. And many of them will do anything to win, however dirty, illegal or immoral. One can't imagine why Sandra Bullock wanted to, or would make this film. It's not a very pretty product, and certainly not entertaining. Billy Bob Thornton plays a crass, crude, and crooked jerk. It's a type of role he seems to be drawn to since ""Bad Santa"" of 2003. This isn't a film that most would enjoy."
" Political Dice
",0.0,0.9965,2018-04-10 00:00:00,9,"From an entertainment perspective the film was enjoyable and the climax was satisfactory and fulfilling. In fact those end scenes built up to quite a powerful and thought provoking finish which was a nice turn in pace in comparison to the rest of the movie - which focused more on comedy. 
The film had a good mix of seriousness and humor.The Script was pretty tight and displayed some humorous moments which did not detract from the story. It also had real heart. The choice of setting was really interesting. It allowed the film was show how people go in to countries with no consideration of the consequences of their actions and then happily leave as if nothing ever happened. Sandra Bullock's character was pretty intricate and multi-layered which was really cool to watch and her acting talents were strong in bringing out the various aspects of the character. Also, I would like to note that showing a strong woman in politics was bold and great to watch as she tried to thrive in the dog-eat-dog world of male-dominated politics. Sandra did a great job in applying these difficulties to her character and how it ground her down in some ways and drove her on in others. There were some moments where I was laughing, or shouting at the screen (the bus scene) or truly felt the intensity of the emotions of the characters (the ending ). All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film and can't believe I hadn't heard more about it upon its release. 9/10"
" If voting changed anything, they would make it illegal
",-0.5574,-0.3129,2018-01-18 00:00:00,9,"The film claims to be ""inspired by true events"" but is closer to a work of total fiction and is designed to make us look at our own candidates in an election year who claim there is a crisis and they are the only ones who can fix it.The movie is entertaining as the quirky and unorthodox Jane Bodine (Sandra Bullock) is hired by a Bolivian senator in a presidential bid. Castillo (Joaquim de Almeida) is ""not trustworthy, not likable, stuck up little a-hole."" He also has a smirk and connections to the IMF. Bodine takes on the job because her opponent is managed by Pat Candy (Billy Bob Thornton) a master strategist who has beaten Bodine on several occasions.Castiilo's lack of charm is changed into being a forceful individual who can get the job done in what is now a ""time of crisis."" Bodine has a history with Candy as the campaign becomes personal. This is an interesting behind the scenes view of campaigns filled with humor and universal political themes.Good job Bullock.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Sex talk."
" Okay, but doesn't take you anywhere you haven't been before
",0.1154,0.9934,2017-12-13 00:00:00,6,"A washed-up political strategist, Jane Bodine, is hired by a political consultancy to help their client, Senator Castillo, win the Bolivian general election. Bodine used to be the best in the game but an unfortunate series of events during a campaign saw her reputation, and confidence, destroyed. What sealed the deal was that she will be coming up against her long-time arch rival and nemesis, Pat Candy.Reasonably entertaining. Some funny moments and the mood is generally quite light-hearted. Some of the political machinations and stunts are quite clever too and often add to the humour. Some degree of engagement too, as it is clear who you should be backing in the presidential race.However, there's not much new here. The setting - Bolivia - may be original but that's about it. Movies like Primary Colours and Wag the Dog plus TV series like Veep and House of Cards have already covered the dirty inner workings of politics and elections, and done it a lot better. Real life would have prepared the audience too.And there's the other problem. Who wants to be reminded of what a loathsome industry politics is? Not me, that's for sure.There are two twists towards the end, but they don't really do anything for the movie. The first was a touch predictable. The second was idealistic and superficial. They could just have ended it with the election results and left one with the impression that the movie is a comedy. Instead, after being reasonably light-hearted all along, the movie suddenly ramped up the drama and attempts at profundity towards the end. Was pretty shallow and a matter of too little, too late."
" Good movie, too bad smoking lobby ruined it
",-0.5574,0.6855,2017-12-06 00:00:00,7,"It's a good movie with allot of ""cool people"" smoking in every tense situation. Feels a bit like a cigarette commercial. Other than that the story and the acting is great, it even has some really powerful emotions. I thought smoking is not cool anymore because it kills so many people but I guess they are still finding a way to get to kids."
" Worst protagonist's rival role, nonsense moments
",-0.7783,-0.9739,2017-04-14 00:00:00,4,"The worst protagonist's rival role I've ever seen. He's supposed to be a professional in his role, but I've not seen a single action to make me believe it. The only tactics I've seen in the movie are: 1) paying a random person to smash an egg on the head of a politian; 2) make your client say a quote that you heard from your rival 5 minutes before the press-conference (like, what the hell? seriously?). Another moment I wanted to quit watching the movie was during the racing of 2 buses - what was the point? to show your ass off (literally) to your rival? to ride off the cliff and kill the candidate and hole crew? Seriously, after that moment, I didn't take this movie seriously at all. There are moments I liked, but they are very few, and thus I don't think this movie deserved more than I'd rated."
" An underlooked gem
",0.0,-0.4687,2017-03-15 00:00:00,9,"""Our Brand is Crisis"" saw its pre-release hype dissipate by the time it hit theaters for reasons I can't easily pin down with a few minutes of googling. What I can say is that it's a definite shame this film didn't make it into the conversation for Oscar or gross more than $7 million domestically, because it's a richly textured film with a well-paced sense of adventure and exoticism.The film revolves around the rivalry between two ace political strategists (Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton) working different sides of a Bolivian election with the cultural sensitivity of two seasoned board game players competing in a heated contest of Risk. Bob Thornton's character is based on James Carville (between this, Saturday Night Live, and Documentary Now, he seems to be a standard part of any impressionist's repertoire). Bullock channels a slightly darker version of her frazzled but endearing rom-com persona in a part that was originally scripted for a male character and she steals the show. A supporting cast of Scoot McNairy, Anthony Mackie, Zoe Kazan and Ann Dowd adds a cadre of characters with varying degrees of seriousness that makes for some memorable bantered dialogue. It's perhaps in keeping with the film's commentary on geopolitical ethno- centrism that the presidential candidatate (Joaquim de Almeida) is the least interesting character in the entourage. There is, however, a relationship that Sandra Bullock's character develops with a local teenager that comes closest to providing the film's protagonist with a moral awakening. The film successfully threads the needle of thought-provoking without being overly preachy, even if the resolution is slightly less profound than it thinks it is."
