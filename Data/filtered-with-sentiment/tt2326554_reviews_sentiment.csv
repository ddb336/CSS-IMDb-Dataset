" It's not Iranian nor is it a good vampire movie
",-0.3412,0.9293,2021-03-25 00:00:00,5,"This movie got hyped on its release as a ""Black and White, Iranian, Vampire, indie film"". Sounds amazing, right? No. The movie is clearly filmed in America, the Black and White visuals add nothing to the movie, and the vampire aspect of the film isn't very interesting nor does the film really have anything to do with ""vampires"". Now, to be fair, this has more to deal with expectations, but I think the publicity and press that this movie received when it was first released was a bit damaging to my view and other people's views of the film. The movie, at best, is a good student film. There's no element of the film that I would consider excellent, noteworthy, or even demands attention to be seen. It's not a horrid movie by any means, but I was greatly disappointed by the film when it received so much hype and praise about the background of the film and its premise, when it's literally just an English director making an Iranian movie filmed in California with a punk skater chick vampire. Just because a director is of Iranian descent does not make the movie an ""Iranian movie"" and I think people used this point to oversell the film and make people think that they were watching an Iranian flick."
" Moody Iranian vampire film
",-0.3612,0.9744,2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Set in an oil industry ghost town-like city in Iran, this movie, directed by newcomer Ana Lily Amirpour - an American of Iranian descent - is highly reminiscent of Jim Jarmusch's early style. Interestingly, in an interview between her and legendary producer/director Roger Corman on the DVD extras, she claims she's not much of a fan of Jarmusch. But as virtually everyone who studies film has pointed at the stylistic similarity, she's taking it as a compliment.Like Jarmusch's work, the movie is shot in atmospheric black and white - and it works beautifully. The dialogue is all Persian (Farsi) - even though the movie was shot in America, standing in for Iran - and is subsequently sub-titled. However, this does not work against the film (whose strength is its visuals) at all, as the dialogue is at all times minimal and slow, thus making the reading easy and unobstructive to the fascinating camera work.So, it's a horror movie. It's principal character is a Persian woman vampire - who stalks the town, robed in a black chador, which is quite an unsettling shadow to behold standing 10 feet away from a potential victim late at night. The events exist within a kind of imagined Iranian underworld of pimps, hookers, drug dealers and street urchins. Our vampire watches this dark town, at times slowly riding a skateboard down the street! When she interacts with people, she is unblinking, mostly un-verbal, and seems to be at all times appraising their circumstances and their worth.Aside from the beautiful blocking shots and photography, a high point of the film is its use of sound effects, music (which sometimes references Morricone-like spaghetti westerns) and an impressive soundtrack of mostly modern pop music.Any criticism of this movie (though it's more praised than not) seems to center around it being ""style over substance"" and ""too slowly paced"". Well, it is moody, that's for sure - and maybe too slow for many of today's horror fans, that's true - but there's no arguing that its greatest strength is its style."
" Much better than a horror film
",-0.2023,0.9872,2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,"I'm tempted to point out that certain films aren't about the plot, they aren't about action, they aren't even about characters... they're just about atmosphere, about mood. This excellent film is a little like that, but that doesn't do it justice, because the mood changes in different parts of the movie. That's intentional, of course, because this film works on many levels... it delves into different genres, or pays tribute to different genres, at various times.Before I get too deep in the weeds, let me say I enjoyed the hell out of this film. It's not fast paced, but it's wonderful. The viewer must have patience and be willing to tolerate a slow moving film, cuz it sure ain't no action film. In one scene the two main characters are standing a few feet apart and it must take 7 or 8 minutes for them just to turn and slowly move close to one another.The film is very well acted (and no it's not devoid of characterization as I hinted at in the first sentence). The strongest aspect may be the cinematography, which is superb. Obviously there's a strong element of Film Noir, but you'll even get a bit of a Tex-Mex-Western vibe in a couple of places. In terms of ""horror"", it's really very mild by today's standards, so don't expect that. Also don't expect much dialog, because it's rather sparse and understated in that regard.Anyway, I loved it, it's different, and I can't believe it's the director's first major feature film."
" Art, film noir and a vampire.
",0.0,0.7984,2021-03-04 00:00:00,7,"Caught this one on Joe Bob Brigg's Last Drive-in on Shudder. I was intrigued by the idea behind it: an Iranian take on a western themed Vampire. I was a little disappointed to learn that it wasn't Iranian at all. The actors all seem to be Iranian-American. The director is two generations away from being An Iranian. It seems that the movie was placed in Iran more as an art choice. The city in the film depicts many of the vices in Iranian propaganda about the West, so maybe that's what drove the choice. However, after saying all that I have to say that the realization that this film has no real connection to Iran at all does not diminish the viewer's enjoyment of it. It's an art film first and foremost. It's depiction of story, characters, and the Iranian town are almost dream-like and set up a surreal viewing experience. I've read reviews comparing the style to many other directors, but one that seems absent seems the most logical: Jean Rollin. It's definitely worth a look if you like vampires. It's subtle but sinister. And it's black and white film structure leaves it remarkably satisfying. People seek hidden messages in the film. I dont think it's hidden at all. It's actually spelled out when the vampire meets the little boy on the streets at night. Add what she says to the boy to the victims she chooses. Yes it's most likely a statement on the culture of her heritage but it's equally applicable in all cultures."
" An amazing, outstanding piece of cinema
",0.8316,0.9174,2021-02-16 00:00:00,9,"Imagine Jarmusch's Mystery Train as a vampire movie. A Lynchian-styled Eastern Western. The most personality-filled good boy of a cat. Iranian drug dealers with cool tattoos.Frankly, if those things aren't doing it for you, best skip this one. You are not the target market. If these things chime, you won't want to look away from the screen.An outstandingly good movie!"
" An Iranian Horror masterpiece!
",0.1759,0.6476,2021-01-28 00:00:00,9,"Everything about this movie reeks of sheer artistic brilliance. Breathtakingly shot in black & white, which adds to the eerie and surreal atmosphere. The performances given by all the actors gives so much more to this visually stunning movie. I can't believe I waited this long to finally watch it in 2021. Speechless!"
" Minimalist, effective, Sisyphean with neato sound.
",0.4767,0.6011,2020-12-17 00:00:00,8,"A slow-paced hipster-era vampire story that is so stylish it hurts. ""A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night"" combines old-fashioned storytelling with contemporary setting and aesthetics, and the result is a quite unique and atmospheric film. It's not faultless but it feels very fresh and special."
" GREAT ORIGINAL.
",0.7506,0.9677,2020-10-17 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't aware I needed a black and white, romantic, feminist, iranian vampire theme film in my life. A great original movie that puts u in a nostalgic mood thanks to its style but also doesn't fail to deliver a humorous, romantic and thrilling story."
" Don't walk at night and be good.
",0.4404,-0.4779,2020-09-30 00:00:00,6,Very interesting movie taking on Vampires. It takes the vibe of Sin City or comic books and Muslim culture of women together. In this case Ana Lily Amirpour is a vampire who takes out the evil men. Overall its a good movie.
" Just another night in Bad City.
",-0.5423,-0.8293,2020-09-22 00:00:00,6,"Though it's occasionally dull, 'A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night (2014)' is also rather beguiling. Its an odd mix of artsy drama and tooth-baring horror, with its almost inconsequential story never quite going where you expect it to. The narrative explores the lives of a few residents of 'Bad City', an Iranian town (actually filmed in L.A.) brought to life with crisp black-and-white cinematography, as they intersect in calmly disturbed ways. Essentially, it's a story about loneliness. The eponymous girl wanders the streets at night, eventually meeting a disillusioned young man who seems to have a similar problem. The two form a unique relationship that holds steady through even the most difficult of tests; they have an unspoken yet palpable chemistry. Some sequences are strangely affecting, in a way, and the whole affair just drips atmosphere. It's so unconcerned with traditional pacing that it often threatens to become, well, boring and yet it never quite does. It isn't exactly exciting or, even, overtly enjoyable. However, it has an almost unclassifiable charm to it. It certainly won't be for everyone, but it's a distinct and effective experiment nevertheless. 6/10"
" Waste of time.
",-0.4215,0.4037,2020-08-19 00:00:00,4,How this got the high score it had on here I will never know. I only decided to give it ago because I liked the film The Bad Batch which is by the same lady that did this and they claimed this was better?? NO ITS NOT!! the acting fine I suppose but it's not that hard to act miserable all the time is it and never smile. 1 dimensional characters. The reason this was shot in black & white was because colour wouldve shown how crap it really is. The only creepy moment is with the little boy. I felt like her ( vampire) riding the skateboard was a rip off of Fright Night 2 from the 80s which had a vamp on skates. I thought at first we was gonna be carried by a good soundtrack like Bad Batch. But there was just 1 ok 80s song. I watched it through it was bearable ok but just a going nowhere plot or characters. People must've been paid to give this good reviews. Because this isnt a good film at all really. I wish I'd just gone ahead and watched Lost boys as was on a kinda 80s or 80s feel roll with films lately but man I'm left dissatisfied now
" Cat is the best bit.
",0.6369,0.4201,2020-07-10 00:00:00,3,"Film is simply boring and slow. I struggled to find character development instead we get over stylish copy paste people.
Iranian James Dean that gets into trouble with Iranian Ninja (Die Antwoord) that is a pimp to Iranian Monica Bellucci. There is also Iranian indie rock vampire that is always sad and seen Amélie way to many times.
It feels like the director/write watched The Addiction (1995) and decided to remake it in Farsi.
Beautiful cinematographer with way too to many lense flairs.
If this film would focus more on The Cat it would be much better more interesting."
" Beautiful, Beguiling And Quite Unlike Anything Else In The Horror Landscape
",0.0516,0.9789,2020-07-09 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't aware I needed a black and white, romantic, feminist, Iranian vampire film in my life; but I really did need this one. It's beautiful and beguiling, the Middle Eastern setting, the female gaze of director Ana Lily Amirpour and the choice to shoot in black and white all combine to create a horror-vampire film quite unlike anything I've seen before.In tone, it has a little in common with Let The Right One In but is still very different from that film. The female gaze seemed to speak to me something about a theme of bodies, and specifically body image and our relationship with our physical self; but on reflection, I think that's more to do with how over-sated we have become with imagery in service of the male gaze. There is also a kind of intimacy ad beauty to this film that little else in the genre creates, almost so much as to make us feel like participants in the film's intimacy as opposed to mere observers. There are scenes involving dancing which are amongst the most beautifully shot of any film I can remember; overall this is a film which moves entirely to a different rhythm of anything in the songbook of horror films. It doesn't scare so much as it invites us in; afterwards, it resides in the brain like a familiar but slightly alien melody, one that you'll never be able to shake and will never want to shake. Gently yet unmistakably magnificent.."
" ERIE & UNUSUAL
",0.0,0.5927,2020-06-21 00:00:00,8,"I loved the black and white gave the movie a spooky eerie setting. It was different. A female vampire stalking men that disrespected women and killing them by sucking their blood. She does fall in love with the lonely gentleman. He is a drug dealer who inherited his occupation by killing the previous drug dealer who was ruthless and cared little about anyone but himself.
They meet and fall in love."
" Hmmm.
",0.0,-0.7634,2020-05-30 00:00:00,6,"The Good:
1) Great decision to shoot B&W.
2) Acting doesn't disappointThe Meh:
1) Lazy overdone script/theme. Starts off as vamp horror, meanders into a corny love story.
2) Unrelatable. No one fights or even tries against the mighty vampchick. And sorry if I don't relate to a feminazi vamp killing random beggars/scaring little boys and then shrugging it off as ""I've done bad things"".
3) Lacks an interesting script/ends up being forgettable except for pretentious art house suckers who keep putting stuff like this in their top movie lists."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.1655,2020-05-26 00:00:00,1,"5 minutes into this and I was wondering if it was ever going to get going. 7 hours later, I was hoping she would eat him so something could happen. The one part of the whole movie that was worth watching was when the muslim vampire woman terrorized a little boy in the street. But that lasted 30 seconds and is not worth the wait. Just hours and hours of nothing, blank stares, long silences for no reason."
" Ingenious
",0.0,0.6492,2020-05-20 00:00:00,9,"The first 20 minutes of the film are amazing, unparalleled to anything else I've ever seen. While watching it I couldn't believe how good those minutes were, but then the movie switches genres and from there on forward everything changes. When the supernatural element kicks in it kinda ruins what came before it, but still the rest of the film it's unique and compelling - I couldn't help myself loving it.
This film is a directorial debut but it doesn't feels like it is, because although the director goes a bit experimental here, this it feels like a very well studied film. You can tell that the director knew what she was doing by looking at the amount of detail she putted into the film. She also wrote the film and drew most of the frames we got to see, and from the very beginning of the film the shots look so iconic and timeless complimented by the gorgeous black and white cinematography. The vibe I got looking at the shots in the beginning of the film was tarantinoesque. The first 20 minutes felt like a Tarantino movie, not only because of the shots but also because of the way the music it's used. Oh and I loved the soundtrack. Every song fits very well with the scenes that are chosen for.
Overall, a fantastic directorial breakout. I have already watched the director's other film (The Bad Butch) and although it wasn't as good as this one, I can't wait for what she'll ""serve"" us with her upcoming projects."
" A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night
",-0.25,0.9302,2020-05-11 00:00:00,7,"A vampire stalks a town in Iran seeking out male victims who all share one thing in common - they have treated women badly.We meet our main character Arash whose father is addicted to drugs and is being taken advantage of by a local scum dealer who also is in charge of prostitutes in the area. One night, the man physically attacks one of the sex workers and that is when we first see The Girl standing there eerily watching the whole thing go down. She eventually reveals herself as a vampire and brutally kills him at his apartment. The rest of the film is of the vampire stalking the streets of Bad City at night, seeking out any man who is rude or disparaging or violent towards a woman.She stalks her victims and savagely drains their blood as only a vampire would do. Eventually, she meets Arash and the two have an instant romantic connection. He shows himself to be one of the good guys to her. But with his father being a pretty bad man towards women, and this vampire on the prowl, could this spell doom for these two?I liked this movie for it's technical work almost more than the overall story. The shadowy imagery is really something special, great job by director Ana Lily Amirpour. The stalking scenes with the vampire walking along the streets at night are very effective as well. Sheila Vand did a good job, the walking and stopping is very Michael Myers like. I also felt that the whole thing being in black and white really made it a strong atmospheric horror film, much like Nosferatu with shadows and light.There was one scene in particular that was really scary that stuck out in my mind. It was when the vampire stalks the little boy in the streets and asks him if he;s been a good boy. The voice gets very deep and demonic and it's very well done. The negatives of the film is that is does drag on a bit too much, even for me who doesn't mind a slower moving horror movie. It also doesn't follow a clear path or plot. I didn't lose complete interest, but it definitely tails off towards the end and becomes a bit tedious.Overall, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is a pretty effective and unique horror film. I liked that the whole thing was black and white, and that the theme of a woman vampire killing terrible sexist men was very satisfying. The direction from Amirpour is the real major positive of the film.7/10"
" Preeeeetty good
",0.4404,0.9698,2020-04-15 00:00:00,10,Loved everything about this movieThe cast is great i loved the setting. Made me super uneasy.I'm sad i haven't watched this before. Movie had a huge Tarantino vibe.10 is a high score but i truly believe it's a perfectly crafted movie. Watch it for yourself and thank me later.
" Simply remarkable
",0.5574,0.9606,2020-03-11 00:00:00,10,Really special film. independent smash hit. Actors and production group not a home run with film. The best must be saved for last and that is the director and the girl. Both absolutely beautiful and the best.

" Excellent pictures, mediocre story, poor accents
",0.1531,-0.2873,2019-11-08 00:00:00,6,"The pictures, athmosphere and song tracks are really interesting to me. The athmosphere reminds me of sin city and down by law. But the story is very simple and of average elegance. The movie isn't scary at all. Another negetive point about the movie is accents of actors, they have poor and rediculous persian accents which ruin the emotional dialogues for Persian audience."
" It's so nice to find a horror that isn't too heavy handed with itself.
",-0.1548,0.8344,2019-08-01 00:00:00,8,Elegant and well paced little modern ghost story (not literally about ghosts) with a quiet power about it.It sometimes feels more like a music video and it's easy to get lost in its hypnotic spell that makes the vintage horror paradigm feel fresh again.It really lets you decide how you want to feel about it and doesn't aggrandise its own terrors like a lot of other movies in the genre. It handles the occasional dusting of humour very well too.

",0.0,0.765,2019-06-26 00:00:00,3,Some cool and unique stuff with a great sound track. Other than that it sucked. I enjoyed it for a while but then it started getting tedious and weird and ended up being pretty pointless. (1 viewing)
" Starts Out Promising But Disappoints
",-0.3716,0.9657,2019-06-15 00:00:00,9,"A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT is a film with a very fun and promising premise, and of course a great title as well. The cinematography is beautiful and the acting is good as well, from what I can tell.Unfortunately, the film becomes boring pretty quickly. It doesn't take us anywhere interesting, as we'd expected from the beginning. Ultimately, we are let down. It feels too long for the story it is trying to tell. Could have done with a re-edit, in my opinion. Do not recommend."
" It's either art or BS
",0.0,-0.9451,2019-05-23 00:00:00,4,"This movie was called ""the first Iranian vampire western"", even though it was shot in Taft, California. It's all about a lonesome vampire in the Iranian ghost town known as Bad City. It's also a Tarantino combination of influences, in black and white, that will either make you say, ""Wow, that's art"" or ""Huh, that's self-indulgent tripe.""Arash works hard to take care of his heroin-addled father. He's proud of his car until it's taken by his father's dealer Saeed (Dominic Rains channeling Ninja from Die Antwoord). Our hero - such as it is, no one is really all that heroic here - tries to protect the modesty of Shaydah, the wealthy young woman he works for, but still steals her earrings.As for Saeed, his interlude with one of his girls is cut short by The Girl (Sheila Vand), a vampire who soon kills him. Arash comes to the dealer's home to get his car back, finds him dead and takes his money and drugs. Now, he can stop working so hard and get everything he wants. That doesn't happen - he can't even win over Shaydah, who rejects him.He goes into the night high on Ecstasy and encounters The Girl. She takes him to her place, where they listen to music. The next night, he pierces her ears and gives her the stolen earrings.Meanwhile, our hero's dad is a mess, thinking that a cat is his dead wife. With all of the dealer's money and drugs, he forces a prostitute to get high with him, which marks him as evil in The Girl's eyes. She kills him and the prostitute helps her dispose of the body.Arash soon learns that The Girl was behind his father's death, but they still leave town together, even after he pulls over to the side of the road, leaving him unsure of what to do next.This was the first feature for Ana Lily Amirpour, who was born in England, grew up in Florida and went to school in California. She was hailed as the new Tarantino as this film released, but the follow-up, The Bad Batch (which she described as ""Road Warrior meets Pretty in Pink with a dope soundtrack"" and ""El Topo meets Dirty Dancing"") didn't do so well. She's working on another movie called Blood Moon, which is """"a mind-bending adventure set in the humid, neon-lit streets of New Orleans. Inspired by adventure films of the 1980s and '90s, Blood Moon follows a young girl with special abilities. After escaping from an asylum, she enters back into the chaotic reality around her, making unexpected allies along the way.""This is a movie with a spaghetti western soundtrack while referencing David Lynch and having a skateboarding vampire. Honestly, it's really well made. Almost painterly. But it left me cold, with long stretches of absolutely no action. In fact, it's a rather cold film.Maybe it's because it has it's heart in the world of the art film. There's a thin line between exploitation trash and celebrated cinema - it just depends where the movie is playing. It just feels like someone standing in front of your art class and trying to amaze you because they just read some philosophy books for the first time and want to wow you with how their painting really means something, man."
" Marvelous!
",0.636,-0.5499,2019-05-13 00:00:00,7,"A brief first glance at the title and poster might lead one to believe this is an action movie about a girl fighting back against attackers in an evening setting. But it's so much more than that; it's about a young lady who happens to be a vampire in Iran. Yes, it's probably the first and only Iranian vampire movie you'll ever see. Shot in black and white, it follows the nocturnal escapades of The Girl in question. Her victims include both good and bad people, and she speaks very little. This latter trait lends quite a bit to the mystery surrounding her and the horror she perpetuates. Because the movie's in black and white, there's a cinema verite' feel about it, too, as if you're the one walking past the playground after dark with The Girl staring at you from across the street. And staring, always staring. The movie is brilliantly shot and acted, not just by Sheila Vand as the title character but also Arash Marandi and Mozhan Marno as an everyman and a prostitute, respectively. A must see not just for vampire-film aficionados but also for all fans of compelling, if terrifying, drama."
" Terrific Vampire Story
",0.4767,0.953,2019-04-30 00:00:00,10,"This is a vampire story unlike any other in cinema. Unlike countless other works of fiction, the vampire here is a complete character rather than a boring movie monster. It is a complete rethinking of the classic vampire story and the creators deserve massive credit for it. It isn't easy to find something novel in a genre that has been sculpted for decades to be formatted in a certain way, but this movie has found it. So because the vampire is a fleshed-out character, when it kills or interacts with other characters, it feels like these decisions and relationships carry some serious weight and some damning consequences for it. In addition, the sleek black-and-white textures set the atmosphere beautifully, with some gorgeous photography -- a beautiful film. Highly recommend."
" A great film with a vampire character in it
",0.6249,-0.7106,2019-04-11 00:00:00,10,"This won't be everybody's favorite movie, but I don't see any flaws in it. It clearly does exactly what Ana Lily Amanpour wants it to do, and the combination of elements is really impressive, something I won't forget.So, the one thing that everyone is going to know going into this film is that it's a vampire movie. But is it really? One of the characters is indeed a vampire, I guess, but the film is not about any of the mechanics of being a vampire, or how you would kill one, or what happens if the sun shines on them, or how the thing with the cat works, or how the vampire became a vampire or any of that. It is not a movie which focuses on the vampire as a monster, but also it is certainly not a movie where the vampire uses their talents to help society like in about a dozen TV shows I can think of (""Vampire Prosecutor"" from South Korea comes to mind). In fact just about the entire plot would work if ""The Girl"" were not a vampire but just someone kind of quiet and quirky and dangerous. But it wouldn't be as cool, of course.Some of the things we see are along the lines of ""Vampires - They're Just Like Us!"" ""They go around on skateboards!"" ""They drop by and check out your CD collection!"" ""They like a practical joke!"" No, she's not a commonplace person and really not benign. But in the shabby industrial/urban cityscape of this film, there are a lot of dangers and dangerous people.Arash who makes up the other half of this odd couple trope has a lot more problems in his life than just a vampire. His father is a coke addict; he's in debt to the neighborhood pusher/pimp (all you really need to know about this guy is that he has the English word ""SEX"" tattooed on his throat); said lowlife then takes Arash's prized old car on account of the debt. When Arash's fortunes take a better turn, at least on the surface, his father is still a problem and his acquaintances are trying to drug him up. He could use a friend. Or companion. Or someone to hang out with. At this point the movie starts to resemble a very peculiar variant on the rom-com genre.Being in a relationship is a dangerous and unpredictable thing anyway - particularly for human women, as we know - and a lot of people are going to watch this and be reminded of their own relationships, not the brightest and chattiest ones, but things that they actually experienced with humans. Turning back to the rom-com theme, you know how at the end of some of them you have a couple going off together, maybe sort of looking at each other like ""Looks like we're doing this, is this really the best idea?? but *shruggies*"" - ""The Graduate"" and ""Choose Me"" are exemplars of this. Amanpour's variation on this is priceless and memorable, with the big difference that here we have Masuka the cat!! And the vampire part, of course."
" refreshingly original!
",0.3802,0.9028,2019-03-30 00:00:00,7,"The hype over this movie was high, and for good reason. The brooding atmosphere is enhanced by a foreign place, great indie music, intense acting, and real life issues- not to mention that the film is shot in black and white. The main actors are fantastic and I actually felt myself caring about them!The film is not overly gratuitous and had a loner cowboy vibe blended with supernatural elements. While the pacing may be a bit slow, it just shows you don't need aggressive action, jump scares, and violence to create a tense atmosphere. A must see if you are interested in a fresh take on a saturated genre!"

",0.3182,0.7579,2019-03-01 00:00:00,6,"Arthouse cinema, at the best of times, can be divisive. Typically critics adore the presence of thematic interpretation, whereas general audiences require more hand-holding in order to get through the ambition. For me, Amirpour's directorial debut was a disappointment. It's a dramatic case of style over substance, to the point where the substance was lacking almost entirely, resulting in what resembles a pretentious art project. A young girl prowls the streets of ""Bad City"", an Iranian ghost town with junkies, prostitutes and murderers as its inhabitants, to which she slowly kills them off with her primitive vampiric powers.Simply titled as ""The Girl"", she becomes this embodiment of an alternative policing figure where she slowly becomes corrupted by stealing one personal belonging from each victim. A primary theme that powers through Amirpour's horror feature film that allows strands of feminism to take hold. Her ominous yet ethereal presence is the manifestation of the ghostly environment around her. As the film progresses, ""The Girl"" then develops a romance with a hard working Iranian man, who seems to be the only semi-decent individual living in the city. And that's when the film, for me atleast, crumbles into a mess of underdeveloped, confused and monotonous themes. Arash and ""The Girl"" together were absent of any emotion. I felt absolutely nothing as I gradually started to fall asleep whilst they stare into each other with minimal dialogue. It should've been palpable, yet I felt nothing. And that's mostly due to Amirpour's wild combination of various genres. None of them felt prevalent throughout, consequently making the pacing incredibly inconsistent and frequently too slow.It started off well. Vincent's monochromatic cinematography was beautiful and Amirpour's sumptuous long takes made for various jaw-dropping scenes of beauty. Initially commencing the film as a horror, she excellently portrays ""The Girl"" as an innocent individual who certainly has a bite. It then evolves into a romance with the pace of a western and is unable to maintain the exciting horror elements that came before. Its audacious soundtrack also blends a variety of genres and becomes a prominent aspect to the film. But with the huge amount of ambiguity and confusion, it felt underdeveloped and was unable to deliver any thought-provoking sentiment. Its conclusion, if you can call it that, lacked any finalisation of the story and somewhat made me stare blankly into my screen questioning ""is that it?"".This is a peculiar film, and a conflicting one at that. Praise must be given to the ambitious technical aspects, world-building, acting and themes. However the underlying disappointment arises from the failed blend of genres, ultimately leading to lack of focus, which has to come down to Amirpour's direction. It forcefully gives off the impression that this film is important with its contemporary aesthetic, and perhaps it is. Perhaps in years to come, I will view this as an iconic masterpiece. For now though, disappointed. Good, but not enough for me to recommend."
" Noir Skater-Punk Persian Vampire
",0.0,0.9366,2019-02-03 00:00:00,9,"Interzone, Sin City, and now: Bad City. A place outside of time. 90s TV sets but contemporary mobile phones. An Iran where women don't wear chardors, apart from a skateboarding Vampire; but even she wears it loose.She didn't always have the skateboard mind you, she filched it off of a little boy. At least she left him live. Some of her victims - well you just have to smile when a nasty drug pushing pimp gets his comeuppance. But the joy dies back when she takes a derelict, maybe she was giving him peace.After dealing with the pimp she starts up a relationship with a young man whose father was a client/victim of the pusher. We first see this guy when he steals a cat, yeah. The cat steals the show.Black & white cinematography looks great, enough weirdness to keep you intrigued, a vampire with a kind of moral code. The soundtrack is good too. Noir, Euro art, Eraserhead-era Lynch (in a good way).In Persian, subtitled. Debut film by Ana Lily Amirpour. Great film. See it."
" A good modern horror film

Another plot involves a young man (Arash Marandi) who tries to do well in life but is caught between his drug-addicted father and his father's drug dealer. This film is from the U.S. and is in the Persian language.Using tools such as sharp black-and-white cinematography and a moving score with the addition of enjoyable rock music, director Ana Lily Amirpour succeeds in creating an atmosphere that is eerie and mysterious while always being engaging. The ghost town is lonely, quiet, and desolate and the few people in it are rarely friendly.Vand is convincing with an innocent demeanour that hides the internal predator lurking beneath (the attack scenes are powerful). Marandi could easily be compared to James Dean.The intriguing mood lasts for most of the film but it hits a plateau around the last twenty minutes. Despite this loss of energy, it still leaves a lingering effect and is quite unique."

" ""The First Iranian Vampire Western""
",0.0,-0.9431,2018-11-27 00:00:00,7,"Marketed as ""the first Iranian Vampire Western,"" Amirpour's A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is not entirely any of those things. Though the shot composition, lighting, exposure, and sound design may all be reminiscent of classic westerns, this movie features a distinct lack of any shootouts and takes place in a grimy, modern day city. Bad City, as it is called, is a fictionalized Iranian urban district, but the film was shot in Taft, California and Amirpour herself is English-born. Despite how integral the vampire is to the plot, neither is that truly the focus in this movie. Our vampire is not some monster of the night seeking blood to survive, but rather a more sympathetic, lonely vigilante. One thing is for sure though; this movie stands in a class all its own.
Bad City hosts the underbelly of society. The streets are littered with drugs, prostitutes, and violence. Arash is a young man who works odd jobs in order to support himself and his drug-addled father. The girl (with no name) is a vampire who stalks men late at night, preying on those who mistreat women. When Arash confronts his father's drug dealer, he instead finds the girl. Slowly, an unconventional romance develops between the two. The plot may not seem all that complex, but it is the presentation that is most effective with this film.
Several things are immediately noticeable from just the opening shots of this film. The first obvious detail is that the film is in black and white. More than just for aesthetic pleasure, this choice helps highlight many symbols and themes within the film (the relation between night and day or the contrast of our protagonists, for example). Another key subtlety before the title is even shown comes through in the music and sound design. Kiosk's ""Charkhesh e Pooch"" plays over shots of Arash walking with a cat in his arms across a vacant slum. When Arash passes by a hooker on the side of the road, the music begins to warp and devolve into a garbled mess as the next shot shows our lead passing over a ditch filled with corpses without paying even a moment's notice to the horrific scene. The title pops on screen in a blaring white before sinking into a disturbing black. We as an audience are now prepared for the sort of seedy and ignorant underworld we are about to enter.
The film on whole is shot relatively well, with both exposure and contrast being paid careful attention to at all times. The soundtrack, mastered by Bei Ru, is quite intelligent, finding a balance between dramatic, suspenseful, romantic, and darkly comedic. Sometimes it even tackles the challenge of blending these elements, such as in a scene where Arash bears his neck while holding the girl in his arms. The story, though relatively simple in nature, is effective and its message comes across easily without seeming overbearing. The girl embodies female power while the men she preys on have their machismo and masculinity turned to pitiful desperation when it is seen through.
This movie is not without its flaws, however. The editing was somewhat confusing and/or choppy at times, with some shots of the girl coming off as if they were from some cheesy, vampire B-flick rather than a thought provoking film that is deserving of critical analysis. At other times, scenes seemed out of place or context, most noticeably when the girl attacks a homeless man with seemingly no provocation. At times, the performances of Marshall Manesh and Dominic Rains do come off as over-the-top as well (I will say that it may be more so due to Rains' somewhat ridiculous tattoos and, in Manesh's case, the script itself). Another, more glaring issue, however, was the lack of extras. Throughout much of the film, the streets feel purposefully empty, though this does distract the viewer when they have to consider that this is meant to be a city of some repute. These moments, at times, broke down the world which the film had built.
In the end, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night accomplishes much in its 107 minute runtime. Despite branching itself out to great extents, the film's unique genres rarely seem haphazardly meshed together. Amirpour is able to make a typically monstrous villain figure into a relatable and understandable protagonist. All this is done without ever even introducing us to the character with a proper name. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is a must-watch for anyone interested in vampires, westerns, or foreign film, but its appeal is very niche and may be off-putting for some.A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night Letter Grade: B-"

" Haven't Enjoyed a Vampire Movie This Much Since 2010's 'Let Me In'
",-0.4023,0.9891,2017-10-20 00:00:00,9,"Set in an oil industry ghost town-like city in Iran, this movie, directed by newcomer Ana Lily Amirpour - an American of Iranian descent - is highly reminiscent of Jim Jarmusch's early style. Interestingly, in an interview between her and legendary producer/director Roger Corman on the DVD extras, she claims she's not much of a fan of Jim Jarmusch. But as virtually everyone who studies film has pointed at the stylistic similarity, she is taking it as a compliment. Good idea, Ana.  Like Jarmusch's work, the movie is shot in atmospheric black and white - and it works beautifully. The dialogue is all Persian (Farsi) - even though the movie was shot in America, standing in for Iran - and is subsequently sub-titled. However, this does not work against the film (whose strength is its visuals) at all, as the dialogue is at all times minimal and slow, thus making the reading easy and unobstructive to the fascinating camera work.   So, it's a horror movie. It's principal character is a Persian woman vampire - who stalks the town, robed in a black chador, which is quite an unsettling shadow to behold standing 10 feet away from a potential victim late at night. The events exist within a kind of imagined Iranian underworld of pimps, hookers, drug dealers and street urchins. Our vampire watches this dark town, at times slowly riding a skateboard down the street! When she interactswith people, she is unblinking, mostly un-verbal, and seems to be at all times appraising their circumstances and their worth.  Aside from the beautiful blocking shots and photography, a high point of the filmis its use of sound effects, music (which sometimes references Morricone-like spaghetti westerns) and an impressive soundtrack of mostly modern pop music.   Any criticism of this movie (though it'smore praised than not) seems to center around it being ""style over substance"" and ""too slowly paced"". Well, it is moody, that's for sure - and maybe too slow for many of today's horror fans, that's true - but there's no arguing that its greatest strength is its style.   Using classic ratings, I give it 3 1/2 stars. Quite a different take in the vampire canon - I haven't enjoyed a vampire-themed movie this much since 2010's 'Let Me In'. Very impressive for a director's first feature.   Oh - and one more thing - there's a kitty cat in the movie - prominently, which tempts me to raise the rating to a full 4 stars."

Once 'the Girl' shows up it picks up significantly. I found Sheila Vand quite mesmerizing and she steals scenes without saying a word. It almost could have worked with no dialogue as the music does a good job of setting the mood throughout. The vampire comes across as sensual but with a menace lurking behind her eyes.This won't be for everyone. It's light on story and isn't quite a horror. But it creates this atmosphere that had me captivated through to the end.

" I was ready to hate this, but...
",-0.296,0.9524,2017-04-16 00:00:00,6,"This seemed to be the kind of pretentious, heavily referencing, derivative, black and white rubbish that critics crave here in the U.K., within the first 30 mins. Particularly the drug dealer, who seemed largely played for laughs in this otherwise sombre film. His demise was ridiculous, yet predictable and put it at the Tarantino end of the spectrum. Aware of the title, I thought it would simply be the 'girl' murdering various - entirely male - miscreants, with little story as context, just the offscreen politics, which would largely dictate whether you would enjoy this type of thing.Things started to change, however, when Sheila Vand came on screen. She has an undeniable magnetic presence. Some people just have it. She reminded me of Mia Wasikowksa in Stoker, though was less well served by the writer. The trajectory then takes a refreshing turn towards the intimate connection between her and Arash, an unexpected love interest. It then reminded me of Let The Right One In and even had much of the same powerful sense of innocence - as a thing that is never entirely 'lost'.Amirpour then deftly adds in a crucial complication for this new relationship, though she leaves it open whether this complication will be...fatal. She knows dramatic irony, especially by making Arash a peddler of the very thing that indirectly ends his Father's life.Much of it is overlong, languid and too clearly resembles Jarmusch or French or Italian art-house. I wish she had gone the Lynchian route, really invested in the subconscious angle.It's a memorable film though, if not a completely satisfying one, with a very strong central performance."

" Bad City of Angels
",-0.5423,0.8612,2017-04-11 00:00:00,9,"Only cinema can do this. Only cinema can depict a Persian vampire- woman in a chador skateboarding down a lamplit street and make it work, can make it surreal and stunning and totally germane to the plot. A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night is full of such moments, full of gratuitous genius, black humour and cinematic magic.Filmed in monochrome, the minimalist dialogue in subtitled Farsi, the action takes place in 'Bad City', Bakersfield Ca. standing in for Iran. Our hero is Arash (Arash Marandi), a James Dean wannabe with a flash American car he explains took him 2,191 working days (exactly six years including one leap year) to buy. Arash dutifully cares for his ageing, heroin-addicted father, who owes money to a ferally abusive pimp and drug dealer played with evil gusto by Dominic Rains. The dealer takes Arash's treasured automobile in part payment of the father's drug debts. In a vast, bleak night space of almost Soviet immensity, Rains's character treats one of his prostitutes with laconic cruelty, abusing her and ejecting her from Arash's car. She sobs on the ground. Watching from a distance is a silent sentinel, nun-like in her chador, the Girl Who Walks Home Alone At Night.Named only as 'The Girl' in the credits, this is Sheila Vand's avenging dark angel. 'I have done bad things,' she tells Arash further down the story. 'I am bad.' She brings herself wordlessly to the pimp's attention, meeting his eyes with an impassive sadism reminiscent of Rooney Mara's character in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. In his cocaine-fuelled hubris he takes her home. It does not end well for him.Arash, now travelling by bicycle, goes to his work as a gardener and handyman. 'Shaydah the Princess', the daughter of the house where he is working, is a flirtatious, spoiled little rich girl, chatting mindlessly on her cellphone and assessing the result of her rhinoplasty in the mirror. He spots her jewelled earrings on the dresser and gives way to temptation. He wants his car back. He takes the earrings to the pimp's house, arriving just as The Girl is leaving.Inside, he discovers the pimp's mutilated, blood-drained body. On the coffee table is a briefcase stuffed with cash and drugs. He empties it, takes his car keys, and flees.One more scene remains to round off the film's characterisations. The Girl confronts a skateboarding boy, repeatedly demanding -- her face twisted with passion and menace -- 'Are you a good boy? Are you?' She will be watching him, she threatens; she will rip out his eyes and feed them to the dogs if he transgresses. The terrified boy runs away, leaving his skateboard.Arash, driving his reclaimed and beloved car, arrives at a costume party dressed as Count Dracula, his pockets stuffed with the pimp's drugs and cash. Shaydah is there with her friend the 'Skeleton Party Girl', actually a cameo role played by the film's writer and director Ana Lily Amirpour. Drugs are taken. Arash, rejected by Shaydah, finds himself in the street, tripping, lost in Bad City. He is staring at a street lamp, entranced by the light, when The Girl comes skateboarding past.If all stories are ultimately about the search for love, here is the central dynamic of A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night. Under the street light is Arash, the holy innocent, dressed up for a party as the vampire Dracula. Into his life comes The Girl, a genuine vampire killer, on a skateboard. Light Angel and Dark Angel are brought together in a bizarre, comic coincidence. How will this play out?No backstory is given for The Girl, no explanation of how she became who and what she is. We are left to assume that it is something primally dark. Yet something in the character of Arash touches her, something that softens her hard and murderous heart. And something in her draws Arash. Their instinctive, developing symbiosis is brilliantly symbolised by a scene in which he pierces her ears with a safety pin in order to present her with the diamond earrings he stole from Shaydah. She accepts the pain, she accepts the jewels, she accepts the proffered love. The vampire-woman is not tamed -- you can never see that happening -- but she is shown a new and different life beyond the blighted, heartless wasteland of Bad City.Amirpour has created a masterpiece of atmosphere and vision, aided and underpinned by an eclectic soundtrack of mingled Western and Persian pop. The backdrop is nominally Iran, actually California, a setting which in itself produces an austere, strangely familiar Everyplace -- the landscape of the lost soul -- where cruelty, selfishness and existential absurdity besiege from all quarters the simple human longing for Love. There are recurring moments of crazy beauty. The editing could have been a little tighter, which is why I give A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night nine stars instead of a faultless 10. But that is a quibble; every character, every performance, burns into the memory. Amirpour's writing and directing creates a world where the outlandish becomes more real than the superficial 'reality' we inhabit in our daily lives. Once again, only cinema can do this. Breathtaking."
" A surreal black and white vampire movie set in Iran
",0.0,-0.9759,2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Arash is a young Iranian man and his classic car is his pride and joy; he doesn't own it because he is from a wealthy background but because he worked years to earn the money. Then one day a drug dealer takes it to pay the debts of Arash's junkie father. Meanwhile an unnamed young woman, known only as 'The Girl' is walking through the city streets alone at night she is in no danger though; she is the danger! She is a vampire and she is sealing with those who harmed women. One of her victims just happens to be the man who took Arash's car; she kills him and leaves just before Arash turns up hoping to buy it back with a pair of stolen earings. He finds the man dead so takes the car keys along with a case full of drugs. Shortly afterwards he meets The Girl while walking home from a party. They spend some time together but whether she proves to be a danger to him remains to be seen.This was billed as 'the first Iranian vampire western' but while it is set in a fictional Iranian city and the characters speak Farsi it was made in California not that that is a problem. One would think that a film featuring a vampire would be a horror film but too my mind it was far too surreal for that there were a few moments of horror but it wasn't particularly fear inducing. The use of black and white along with Arash's classic car and retro dress and hair-style gave the film a fifties look and the way the camera lingers while nothing really happens provided a beguiling weirdness that I rather enjoyed. Sheila Vand was captivating as 'The Girl' and Arash Marandi was solid enough as Arash. Derector Ana Lily Amirpour did a fine job keeping things interesting even when nothing was happening. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for something different; it won't be for everybody but I enjoyed it."
" Slow and moody
",-0.3612,0.9401,2017-02-16 00:00:00,6,"""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" is an interesting movie. More a curiosity at moments than a movie with a body and a plot, it ends being saved by its atmosphere and the cinematography, even if some of its moments fall into the silly.A vampire is roaming an Iranian town. She goes around killing 'bad' men, talking with people and just being very, very shy. She becomes friends with a young guy. Will she end up killing him?Who are we kidding. The movie doesn't really care about vampires or anything. On the other hand, it has a very nice atmosphere and some of its aspects, like the music or the bleak black and white, give it an atmosphere close to a Western. The camera-work is good, and the direction acceptable enough. There are a couple of scenes really good. The acting, however, is a little bit stilted and, in a couple of occasions, just too silly. The vampire's movements are hilarious (not sure if on purpose).""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" ends being a movie that will be enjoyed more by people who like their movies about atmosphere and 'messages'. Just forget about plot and pace."
" A movie about loneliness and love
",0.34,0.9785,2017-02-06 00:00:00,10,"For me, this was a movie about loneliness and love - every single person in this movie is so lonely and lost and searching for beauty and light - there's a lot of other interesting things about this movie, a commentary on how Muslim women are treated, an ode to horror movies and westerns... but the depth of it and why it touched me was the characters who were all lost looking for love in the darkest of places. The film itself was visually stunning and the soundtrack great, I also loved how different it was, you would be hard pressed to find a movie similar - it has it's own heartbeat and uniqueness. Sure it starts slow, and is slow, you can't be in a hurry to get through this movie, but that is part of what makes it so wonderful because that tone makes you feel how the characters must feel lost and stuck in this ""bad city."" With the Farsi dialect and the interesting yet familiar iconic characters it is like walking into a different world that somehow you know. I loved the vampire, her acting was so subtle all done with her eyes, an animal that you couldn't trust yet wanted to. For those who say this is a pretentious film, I'll never understand, it's ARTSY, but it is not overly aware of itself or trying to be pompous, it's just telling this weird story with these weird characters with this very stylized feel and if you just open yourself to it and go with it and let it wash over you I think you will love it as much as I did."
" What do you call an old vampire? Grampire!
",0.0,-0.7141,2017-01-24 00:00:00,6,"I think that this film is a good reminder that in many ways story takes precedence over visuals as far as engaging with the audience is concerned. The visuals of A Girl Walks Home At Night ranged between good and enchanting. There isn't any reason that the aesthetic of the film should prevent anyone from enjoying it. For the most part the presentation of the film is great and makes it unique and gives the sense of exploring a setting totally distinct from others portrayed in the medium. If the film only had a stronger narrative drive then it could utilized a lot of what I feel is untapped potential. At a certain point scenes start to feel loosely connected and I started to wonder where the story was going and what any of the characters were really hoping to accomplish by the end. Maybe it's my own fault, but somehow, somewhere during the viewing, I lost interest in what was happening or what potentially might happen.While it isn't really clear to me what the director's intended statement is in the film it's difficult to imagine that identity doesn't play into the overall theme. The impression I took from the film is that what defines people is not how they envision themselves, but rather how they appear to others and the effect that they have on their lives. A good example of this would be Saeed. When we see Saeed with Arash and his father, he is large and centered in frame. In that scene Saeed is portrayed as a tyrant with complete power over those around him. When we see him with Atti he is a coward shut in his car, fidgety and more short tempered. In his last scene with the vampire, he gyrates and debases himself before screaming in panic and agony. In this final instance he is a dumb pervert. What the film may also be trying to get across is that whatever value we wish we had, others find in us. Arash wants to be seen as cool by the people around him, but only finds that the vampire sees personal worth in him and draws him to her as a result. The vampire likewise is off putting to others and sees herself as a monster, by her own admission she's done bad things. It's only when Arash finds comfort in her companionship that she is able to realize that value in herself.One aspect of the film that I think serves to emphasize its themes is the costumes. I would argue that the most important costume in the film is that of the vampire's. I would also argue that this costume is made much more effective by the decision for the film to be in black and white rather than color. The most obvious effect of the vampire wearing the hijab is that it gives her an air of mystery. With part of her head and much of her body being obscured it there is a sense of the unknown that is lacking when the vampire is in her room, dressed more casually. The darkness of the hijab working in tandem with the low lighting and lack of color greatly emphasizes this mystery and brings with it a sense of terror. Often the vampire appears like a specter as she almost drifts down the sidewalk stalking her prey. This effect is also a nice contrast to the more open outfit worn in scenes shared with Arash inside her room. To speak of Arash, his costume also reveals things about his character, though I would say in a more meta fashion. Frankly I could not help but be reminded of James Dean or Marlon Brando when by the end Arash is clad in a tiny white T-shirt and leather jacket. While those articles of clothing do not carry to much real significance on their own, the fact that they are reminiscent of well established rebel figures in film does a lot to express the general attitude of the character. The imagery allows us to project things onto the character which he might not make clear about himself. I think the main thing I would like to take away from this film has much more to do with the narrative than with the characters or presentation. As I have already expressed, I feel that the film lacks narrative drive. Often I found that scenes would play back to back but they failed to feed into one another. I would not say that this goes for all of the film and the instances where the story does flow more organically makes me think that if the entire film were woven together in the same fashion. It's difficult to maintain interest in a story when you're constantly wondering where it's going or how anything is really connected beyond just having the same characters in different scenes. Another thing I would take away is to be very aware of the meta aspects of film which audiences are familiar with. I've already mentioned the costumes but what I would like to highlight is something in the film which I felt was perhaps the worst part of the presentation. The sounds that the vampire made when she actually feeds on and intimidates people I think are not only over the top but will be familiar to audiences. Honestly about a dozen movie monsters and wild animals went through my head the instant the vampire started growling and consuming people. I gather that those noises are meant to be scary but I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't the only person whose enjoyment of the more supernatural scenes was greatly diminished by the completely uninspired part of the film. Overall though I would say that keeping in mind the film tropes that audiences are most familiar thing is very valuable when trying to realize a unique vision that you want taken seriously."
