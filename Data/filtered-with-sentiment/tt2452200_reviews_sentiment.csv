" I liked it hey mikey!! Decent story with a decent cast!!
",0.6083,0.9764,2021-03-13 00:00:00,8,I enjoyed this action suspense thriller a lot wasnt a classic but I recommend watching it you'll be entertained and that's what movies are supposed to do. Ewan was actually very good I generally think hes just mediocre as an actor but sometimes he surprises me. The rest of the cast is excellent. I guess it's based on a true story and or characters so that makes it even more fun.
" Son of Obi-Wan
",0.0,0.9782,2020-11-08 00:00:00,6,"McGregor is a treasure. Seriously, the man is just captivating and likely a terribly underrated actor to most people. Seeing him as this scoundrel dirtbag was really fun and so different than what I'm used to. Vikander is in a similar situation, playing a scuzzy character feels so out of the norm for her but she does a great job. Performances are solid here but honestly the rest of the movie is less exciting. I enjoy the performances and relationships but I needed more to really latch onto it. Worth watching for fan of the cast but beyond that I can't say there's anything magnetic about the film."
" Would have been better with English-speaking actors
",0.4404,-0.7218,2020-10-30 00:00:00,4,"Maybe it's my ears, but I barely understood a word spoken in this movie.Ewan MacGregor's accent is so thick he needed subtitles. The rest of the cast was, what, Australian? They don't speak recognizable English at the best of times. And the girlfriend, there. I have no idea where that accent comes from but I couldn't understand her, either.Throw them into a heist movie that's been done to death and you have an incomprensible mess. Honestly, I've watched movies in French that I understood better just by following the action on screen.As if that weren't enough, it's shot with a steadi-cam in many scenes and grimy lighting throughout, so you end up with a thoroughly unpleasant experience."
" Great prison crime thriller
",-0.3182,0.9943,2020-08-03 00:00:00,7,"I just discovered this little gem. Far from perfect or original but pretty well done.
First, the script is quite good. Even not original it makes you stay focus into the movie till the end.
Second, acting is pretty good. Ewan is great here.
Last, the cinematography is pretty cool. I love the Australia's background. So, overall a great thriller. Shame on me I just discovered on 2020."
" Unbelievable story with good massage!
",0.6114,0.9531,2020-04-13 00:00:00,7,"The story is unbelievable: A kid helps a dangerous prisoner to get out of the prison; they make a big robbery and at last, that kid gets the robbed gold and lives with his beloved girl.
Alicia Vikander plays great! Her art of playing is adorable.
The final massage of the movie is good: Love makes the earth a better place to live."
" ANOTHER EXCELLENT Australian movie

" Kinda hokey and very unoriginal
",0.0,0.4203,2020-03-12 00:00:00,5,"I haven't seen the trailer so I though this will be a prison movie, gangs, fights, learning important life lessons and stuff like that. Unfortunately it was a prison movie for only 10 or 15 minutes, and the rest of it is a very typical story that we've seen in hundreds of movies so far... Underdog who was neglected by everyone is dreaming of a white fence kind of life, he gets accepted in a gang and immediately gets a very important role in a theft of the century despite having no previous experience, falls in love with some random damsel in distress who wants to be with him but she's dependent on some fat old prick, he promises to save her and give her a dream life and blah blah blah... Acting below average even by the overhyped Evan McGregor, story so forgettable that I forgot most of the main characters names while writing this"
" Ewan McGregor is NOT convincing. Whole movie lacks toughness and lacks cool appeal. Seen it all before, done better elsewhere...
",0.4102,0.9677,2020-01-20 00:00:00,5,"Ewan McGregor usually plays romantic comedies or other flully lighthearted movies. Now all of a sudden he is trying to act like a tough gangster. Simply NOT convincing. It's not a bad movie, but it is simply lacking spark and punch. I was left behind with a nagging feeling of boredom after having watched it.Any good? Well, the actors aint bad. There is some violence and action to be enjoyed. Some romance. The overall story aint really bad either. But that's the problem with this movie, nothing is really bad, but there is NO real excitement either..."
" Decently-made trash
",0.0,0.0797,2019-10-31 00:00:00,5,"Good performances, solid direction & editing -- but the story & characters are wall-to-wall clichés, each twist and double-cross is easy to see coming, and the overall plot has no central conflict...it just moves from scene to scene, one escapade after another, without presenting any real arc from beginning to end. It isn't until about halfway through when the story takes on a singular, purposeful trajectory. On top of all that, the whole thing is just another movie about good bad guys...criminals with a moral code, evildoers with honor an audience is supposed to empathize with and have sympathy for. Sorry, but no. Deliberate lawbreakers are not compelling characters, and should never be principal protagonists. It's just an easy route for screenwriters to take in creating motivation, as coming up with something a group of thieves wants to steal isn't very challenging, and their opposing force is always obvious: cops and other law enforcement. It's a well-made movie, but just as readily forgettable."
" Son of a Gun
",-0.34,-0.9971,2019-09-22 00:00:00,4,"I must have heard about this film around the time it was in cinemas or released on DVD, I am sure I remember discussion and praise about the leading actor playing against type, so I was up for it, directed by Julius Avery (Overlord). Basically, 19-year-old Jesse Ryan ""JR"" White (Brenton Thwaites) is sent to an Australian correctional facility for six months as punishment for a minor crime. While inside, he meets Brendan Lynch (Ewan McGregor), Australia's public enemy #1 and a notorious armed robber. Lynch scolds JR for meddling in other people's affairs, when he prevents the attack and sexual assault of his cellmate by prisoner Dave (Sam Hutchin) and his group. His cellmate attempts suicide and JR becomes the target of Dave, but when he attempts a rape, Lynch and his men, Sterlo (Matt Nable) and Merv (Eddie Baroo), rescue JR and kill Dave. In exchange for Lynch's protection, JR agrees to perform tasks for Lynch once he gets out of prison. Six months later, JR is released, and soon meets crime lord Sam Lennox (Jacek Koman), with whom Lynch is in cahoots, and his nephew Josh (Tom Budge). JR is given an apartment to live in, and a pretty young woman named Tasha (Alicia Vikander) arrives to give him some cash and a cellphone, which is used to receive instructions. Following instructions given, JR visits Private Wilson (Damon Herriman) to illegally purchase various firearms. Upon receiving instructions, JR hijacks a helicopter, and instructs the pilot, at gunpoint, to fly to the prison. Lynch, , Sterlo, and Merv orchestrate an escape by taking one of the prison guards hostage until JR's helicopter arrives, they leave, and land to drive away in a getaway car. The group head to Sam's estate, where he recruits Lynch and his men to execute a gold heist at Kalgoorlie, where the expected pay-out is in the millions. Following an incident at a party at the estate, JR takes Tasha out for dinner, she tells him she had a previous relationship with Sam, and that people that from him are killed. The next morning, Lynch warns JR to stay focused on the task at hand and not be distracted by Tasha. The robbery is taking place at a quarry, and rally racer Chris (Nash Edgerton) is hired to be the getaway driver. Back at Sam's estate, the gang plan the heist, and a fight breaks out between JR and Josh. JR stops Tasha from being harassed, she is angry with his impulsiveness, and says that she does not have proper immigration papers, but they end up having sex together. The next day, the group goes ahead with the heist. The group infiltrates the quarry and inserts JR into the ventilation shaft above the gold room. When Lynch, Josh and the other men enter as planned, they end up having a fight, but they evade the police disguised as employees, holding real employees at gunpoint. Then, Lynch releases the hostages and opens fire on the police vehicles and personnel. Sterlo is shot on his way out and begins bleeding heavily, Chris arrives and evades the two chasing police vehicles, but Sterlo dies at the end of the chase, telling Lynch to give his cut to his wife. Sam betrays Lynch, JR, and Tasha, but the three escape safely. JR and Lynch sabotage a rendezvous with Sam in Melbourne, killing his henchman and kidnapping Josh in the process. After interrogating Josh, they find the gold stashed in a storage unit. Lynch and JR kill Sam in his estate. Before JR and Lynch escape for good, it is revealed that JR realised Lynch would discard him once he had acquired the gold, JR masterminded a plan to steal the gold with Tasha and take half. Lynch has no choice but to accept JR's terms. Lynch is identified by a woman as an escaped convict, and he is sent back to jail. Later JR sends Lynch a postcard detailing where the gold has been left for him, and a picture of a pregnant Tasha, hinting at an optimistic future. Also starring Damon Herriman as Wilson and Marko Jovanovic as Ken. Doe-eyed Thwaites does well as the naïve young petty crook, Vikander could have had more time onscreen as his love interest, and McGregor is most memorable as the notorious veteran Scottish criminal who is unwisely seen as a father figure. I agree with critics, they try to fit a number of genres and ideas are thrown together at once, making it a little bit of a mess, prison drama becomes escape movie, and then a heist and a police chase, there are some fairly good scenes with guns blazing, but overall it is a slightly underwhelming action crime drama. Okay!"
" a near brilliant heist movie
",0.5859,0.9561,2019-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Australian film are not my first choice, but this gold heist film with ewan mcgregor in the cast, were trulu good and exciting from the start and all the way to the end. the cast is small and overviewable, and the story is straight and the pace are steady forward. the score chosen for this flick are very balanced and humanizes the graphic action that occurs here and there.its not a grand budget movie, but the grumpy old man did enjoy the entertainment and recommends."
" my notes
",0.0,0.8225,2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,Good movie with a fast paced story and some good action scenes. It had a decent story and I liked the relationship between the two lead actors (1 viewing)
" THE SACRIFICIAL MAN
",0.0,-0.7391,2018-04-17 00:00:00,7,"JR (Brenton Thwaites) meets crime boss Brendan (Ewan McGregor) while in prison. Brendan covers JR's behind, who now owes Brendan. When JR gets out of prison, his first order to aid and abet in a prison break. Once out our twosome embark on a gold heist...with a girl (Alicia Vikander) in the plot to supply some conflict.This was a fairly decent gangster film. It is one worth viewing, but not one I would view a second time. The actors were not overly conniving.Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex and nudity"
" As real as it gets
",0.0,-0.8684,2018-01-10 00:00:00,10,"No exaggeration. This is legit a movie that gets it. If you're Aussie, this is bang on. Even the minor details show how real the scenes are. Haven't seen a movie as real as this, all the violence, prison, drug related parts are no bs. If you're looking for an epic action fuelled, overly stimulating crazy plot twisting movie, You should stick to mainstream Hollywood movies. And yes, the 150 f words make it much more realistic, if you can't accept that - grow up."
