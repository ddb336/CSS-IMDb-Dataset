" The sadly never ending story of corporate greed and destruction
",-0.8481,0.137,2020-06-19 00:00:00,9,"This is the story of sacrifices some brave people are making to protect our planet for future generations. To do so they are fearlessly defying the greed driven manipulations of certain western corporates seeking enrichment by trying to control other people's resources. They do not care about the cost in human lives, human development, or the destruction of other species like the mountain gorillas. And of course, they deny all responsibility for actions taken in their name....."
" Conservation in a live conflict zone
",-0.3182,0.9952,2020-05-24 00:00:00,8,"This starts out as a documentary about a group of rangers dedicating themselves to protecting the park and its mountain gorillas, but ends up becoming just as much a story about foreign oil exploration, local corruption, and armed conflict between the government and rebel groups. This makes it pretty difficult to follow the story, although in a way the choppy pace is nicely symbolic of the real-life turbulence and instability that characterize the Eastern Congo.The way I look at this film is that there are basically two ways of making documentaries. The first takes a top-down approach in clearly laying out the narrative and using the footage to support the storyline - this can make the story clear and easy to internalize but also runs the risk of oversimplification and bias. This documentary follows a second approach - it is not very preachy, not straightforward, and jumps back and forth between different elements of the story. To me this was a good choice, as the entire social, cultural, historical, environmental, political and economic setting is so complex that it would take a whole series to adequately unpack. The downside of this is that I admit I had quite a difficult time mapping the key players, issues, interests and motivations. It was only after doing a bunch of supplementary reading that I was able to feel like I had a decent grasp of what's going on.Could they have done a bit of a better job anticipating key questions for which the viewers would need clarification or more of a backstory? Probably. But, although there may be some ""micro"" biases in how some of the parties are portrayed (as is typical and somewhat inevitable), the film is quite good in steering clear of ""macro"" biases. It depicts locals and foreigners both positively and negatively, uses a lot of live footage, and shows how human activity is both helping and destroying these endangered animals. Credit to the filmmakers for getting all of this footage in dangerous circumstances and weaving it into an interesting and at times dramatic journey. The protagonists of the film are definitely brought to life. The film does a nice job of transporting the viewer into the heart of Africa where one moment you're trying to help save the gorillas, and the next thing you know you're evacuating towns and dodging artillery shells."
" Difficult to watch but absolutely fascinating
",0.664,-0.6076,2020-05-12 00:00:00,9,I loved this documentary. Its a very cinematic documentary with breathtakingly beautiful scenery of nature and wildlife combined with scenes of brutal violence and sadness. Its pretty intense and left me with goosebumps almost crying while watching it. Very educational and really shows the conflicts in the region. It showed how easily things go from bad to worse in that country and puts you right there in the thick of it. Recommended 100% one of the best documentaries!

" What I thought this would be vs an uncomfortable and tense journey through age old human greed story
",-0.7717,0.9697,2019-10-19 00:00:00,10,"I started to watch this thinking it's the heroes, park rangers vs the villains, poachers. Didn't take much long for them to introduce not one but two super villains - M23 and SOCO. These super villains made the poachers seem like two cent henchmen. In between the clashes are the animals, mainly 800 or so endangered mountain Gorillaz.This is no doubt a must watch and should be screened in colleges to inspire young generation about conservation. Why? Because it doesn't show you the biological or ecological side of conservation. In areas like these it's about political and tactical. The job hazard is on the higher side.This documentary is well shot and covers a lot of ground, sometimes little more than it can and that may seem like it has bit into more than it can chew but no one can deny the bravery and skills of the makers and features in this. Bonus: some Uber cute scenes of gorillas goofing around with their caretaker.Take 2 hours of your life and watch this important documentary and pass it along."
" Why would anyone rate this under 10/10??!
",0.0,0.9525,2018-10-18 00:00:00,10,"One of the most incredible moving important documentaries I've ever seen, if you have Netflix and haven't watched this, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? No, stop watching that other show (again!), and put on Virunga dang it!If I ever won the lottery, I would entrust Andre with a significant donation, his mission and attitude is as pure as they come. Same for the amazing investigative journalist Melanie - the best kinda people.This is my first review in years, because I feel so passionately about this film."
" critical
",-0.3182,-0.7269,2018-04-25 00:00:00,7,Starting with an introduction to the history of turmoils in Congo this documentary tells the dramatic story of those who are trying to exploit and suck out everything from the country focusing on the Virunga National Park. The undercover footages are much more theatrical than shown in films since we know these are real and the kind of dialogues we hear in movies which we think as an exaggeration for dramatics seem to be much short of what the real villains are capable to churn out.
