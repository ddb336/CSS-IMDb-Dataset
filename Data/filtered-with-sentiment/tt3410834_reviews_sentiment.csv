" As bad as the book
",-0.5423,0.5992,2021-04-06 00:00:00,3,"I love the 1st two books and the movies were ok but allegiant the movie is very different from the book, which you would think would be a good thing since allegiant the book was terrible, but that's not the case. Sadly, they both are not worth your time."
" Allegiant has good intentions, but fails to deliver a more compelling story, with consequences and strong dramatic moments
",0.6694,-0.6374,2021-03-14 00:00:00,6,"While Divergent, the first film in the saga, held the ends, with a reasonable dramatic level and with a focus of interest in the presentation of the futuristic and dystopian world in which the teenager Beatrice lives, or just Tris (Shailene Woodley), divided into factions; while the second part, Insurgent, proved to be the best of the three by investing more in the psychological of its protagonist and in a slightly cruder, darker footprint; the third feature, which as well as the book could - indeed, should - be the last, brings up what, deep down, could be seen from the beginning.The plot shows the continuation of a war inside Chicago and the search for Tris and Co. for answers beyond the Wall. The first half hour serves to recap everything that happened before - if someone has not followed the story so far it will not be long before they learn about what happened. If in Divergent, Tris and Four are estranged until they are together, in Insurgent the attraction gets stronger and stronger, to the point of making them inseparable. Unlike the Twilight or Hunger Games plots, there is no room for a love triangle here. If this can be understood as a minimal attempt to differentiate yourself from the competition, on the other hand it eliminates any kind of tension and doubt. Thus, the maximum that Allegiant can offer is a momentary separation: Tris decides to believe and embrace her condition of being genetically pure, while Four will continue to be suspicious of everything and everyone until she glimpses the real intentions of those around her. It won't be long before we find out which one is right.Written in six hands by Noah Oppenheim (""Maze Runner""), Adam Cooper and Bill Collage (the last two from ""Exodus - Gods and Kings""), the script is one of the weakest points of this ""The Divergent Series - Convergent"", although it is far from the film's only problem. The future here goes as far as the modest budget allows, full of colors and chrome buildings, which, if well executed, do not compromise the ambience of the script. From there a predictable web of conspiracies is formed and Tris (Shailene Woodley) begins to follow the path that will end the story of the apocalypse created by Veronica Roth. Like its predecessors, Robert Schwantke's film lacks strength in the protagonists' drama, a couple without chemistry and a sense of urgency for the cause they fight for - something that turns the plot into something banal, robbing the force of any suggested discussion.If until now the series and all its characters showed that Tris was an intelligent and determined warrior, that goes down the drain in the first two acts of this production. Shailene Woodley's character is easily manipulated and completely devoid of any personality from the moment she enters the Department and falls for David. As talented as Woodley is, it is difficult for the interpreter to sell the heroine here, especially because her actions contradict everything we knew about the girl. Wasted, the girl delivers a performance on autopilot, lifeless and dull, with Tris being more concerned with getting a new father figure than paying attention to what happens around her. The protagonist does not even win an opponent at the level of the late Jeanine. If in the scenes in ""Divergent"" and ""Insurgent"", Shailene and Kate Winslet fought good duels, thanks to the determination that verged on the villain's insanity, here she is replaced by David, an antagonist who has no definite plan.Unlike the protagonists of the series, Allegiant does not have anything audacious. The film tries to please all types of viewers, but ends up getting lost in the intention and flows with a plot that lacks intelligence. Without the film explaining exactly what the ""pure"" and ""damaged"" preached by David are, his motivations fade away, making the villain as empty as his holograms. Representing the new antagonist of the series, Jeff Daniels (Lost on Mars) is the great addition to the cast, replacing the late character of Kate Winslet. David (Jeff Daniels) waits for Tris in a complex outside the wall, located at O'Hare International Airport, and reveals to him that the earth came into conflict after a discovery that it is possible to change the genetics of humanity, which resulted in a great war that decimated a good part of the population of the planet. Even with the war, they carried out the change in the human genome, where it allowed each one to choose their psychological guidelines, which ended up not working entirely as expected, so the remnants of the changes were isolated in the city of Chicago, to be observed in order to find a way to make the ""damaged"" into ""pure"" human beings.Equally unexplained is the conflict between Evelyn and Johanna (Octavia Spencer), in addition to the silliness of Edgar (Jonny Weston), Evelyn's henchman who made me miss Jai Courtney's nastiness in the previous two features. The one who is saved here (but not by much) is Theo James, as his Four is the only proactive hero in the adventure, taking the place that was Tris in previous stories. Miles Teller makes his dubious Peter work even if in a caricatured way, but it is inexplicable that someone at this point in the story still trusts the character's character. Ansel Elgort remains stuck with a repentant Caleb and ZoÃ« Kravitz, with virtually no role in history.With a minimal budget to mix urban, post-apocalyptic dystopia and a pseudo-futuristic world, ""The Divergent Series - Convergent"" certainly has one of the most unimaginative visuals in the franchise besides weak visual effects, seeming unfinished at various times. The Margin desert is so fake that it never convinces how dangerous (something unforgivable in a world after ""Mad Max - Fury Road"") and the ""advanced"" architecture of the Department and the city of Providence can only be tacky and ineffective. These are factors that, again, work for the moment, but lose their strength when they are conceptually left aside, believing that merely satisfying the audience with a minimum of visual enchantment will suffice. I do not know if much of the blame lies with director Robert Schwentke, who, apart from the shallow exploration of production design in plain view, makes little effort to push his action scenes beyond the bureaucratic limit.When it goes into action, however, the film shows all its youthful (and artificial) vein - from silly catch phrases to the toy noise that each weapon makes when firing a shot. The second act, where the problems of the last part of the saga are presented, this characteristic is more evident. Everything is chewed up and expressed in subtle words so that the whole meaning of Tris's struggle is clear. ""Don't separate people"", ""don't divide us into groups"" and other buzzwords, obvious in the narrative, are repeated to exhaustion unnecessarily. The action in Convergent sounds rather shallow, almost childish. There are many scenes, for example, in which the characters develop novels amid climax points in the story, increasing the surreal aspect - and this is not a compliment - of what is happening on the screen. Some shots seem to be designed to please fans, repeating almost ipsis litteris the contents of the book that gives rise to the plot (the famous fan service). Fair enough, in the case of such a famous literary saga, but it causes some discomfort from the moment that it hinders the paced pace of the work. At one point, director Robert Schwentke delivers here some of the weakest action scenes in the franchise, constantly using shock to try to keep the audience awake - see the practically wired death of a certain character at the end of the first act. There is a scene in which a vehicle appears in the desert that is absolutely indefensible, even from a plastic point of view.Allegiant has good intentions, but fails to deliver a more compelling story, with consequences and strong dramatic moments. Although there are excellent actors in the cast, none of them manage to impose themselves or overcome the didacticism of the script. On the other hand, the film delivers an honestly divided plot, with a well-constructed climax and an ending that leaves hooks (for an ending that never occurred), but does not give up on ending a story - unlike other sister franchises. In the end, Allegiant is a film that tries to talk about revolution and change, but that, deep down, remains attached to the conventions of the industry and the genre, since it underestimates the viewer with obvious resolutions, bets on loving scenes that do not advance in the narrative and so it wastes great actors like Octavia Spencer, Naomi Watts and Jeff Daniels and spoils any relationship we can have with their characters.With special effects below what had already been seen in previous chapters, the negligence of those involved in Allegiant resulted in what should be expected: a sharp drop in worldwide revenue, which meant that the studio simply canceled the last part of the series in theaters. . First it was thought to drastically reduce the budget and launch the last part directly to television, but time passed and after several impasses, the series achieved the feat and did not serve the role, leaving it (for more problems that it showed the three previous films) unfinished, frustrating everyone who had been insisting on following the series since the beginning, especially Tris fans and their friends. Unfortunately, Divergent will be remembered for being a blockbuster series that never ended."
" Ok, not more
",0.296,0.8145,2021-03-08 00:00:00,5,But it might change. One thing that makes movies like this interesting is that right now we are mass vaccinating people all over the world with a substance that modify our mRNA...
" Too bad they didn't make the last film to end the story.
",-0.5423,0.9973,2021-02-14 00:00:00,6,"After the resounding success of ""Hunger Games"", American studios were hungry for more films and trilogies for young adults. ""Maze Runner"" and ""Divergent"" were two of the most evident cases, with scripts and source material that, in everything, remind us of ""Hunger Games"".This film marks the end of the ""Divergent"" trilogy, unfinished because the fourth film imagined never became a reality. It was a pity. Personally, I am an apologist that such an effort, when started, should be ended, if only out of respect for the public. Unfortunately, the studio's interests spoke louder.In this film, we finally discover everything outside the walls of Chicago: a world of aridity and devastation, where a mysterious health organization watches over everyone and everything in order to discover more quickly how to restore damage to the human genome. But not everything is as it seems, and the organization is more murky than it appears.Imported from the previous film, the cast is quite good and competent. Shailene Woodley is beautiful and does a good job. Theo James was also excellent, particularly in the action scenes, and had even more space and time to work here. Evelyn was brilliantly played by Naomi Watts, clearly implying that she is not, and never will be, a good option for governing the city. On the negative side, Zoe Kravitz and Ansel Elgort both disappear from the film.Technically, the film is visually impressive. The cinematography is excellent, vibrant and sharp, and I loved the landscapes of a half-destroyed and decadent Chicago, of dry rivers and lakes and devastated buildings. Incredible, but not coherent: if the entire human population was there, wouldn't more space be needed? Why not rebuild the buildings? Didn't they have two hundred years of peace to do so? Another thing I liked and found amazing was the action and fighting sequences. Really well executed. The sets and costumes were very well done, the highlight being the Agency's facilities and the city of Providence, two sets that even seem worthy of a Star Trek film."
" Worst movie I have EVER seen
",-0.6249,-0.2023,2021-02-03 00:00:00,1,"The divergent books are in my top 10, but I have to say that this movie is the worst thing I have ever seen. I want those two hours of my life back. The movies don't really doesn't fallow the plot of the books. I'm glad they didn't make a part two."
" Disappointed
",-0.4767,-0.7405,2021-01-29 00:00:00,1,"After having watched, divergent and insurgent I thought that the last film would be unmissable, wrong I thought it was rather plain and too quick, I was mostly laughing the whole time and didnt shed a single tear !!!!! insurgent left me on a high but this film ruined it"
" Ok movie
",0.296,-0.6815,2021-01-27 00:00:00,5,"As a film I really enjoyed watching it. However, after reading the books and then watching the film I did not enjoy this film or insurgent. They are both completely different to the books and I felt it was unnecessary. But overall it's worth watching but just not the best. I wish they'd release the 4th film or just redo the whole series so that it follows the books more."

" I enjoyed it....
",0.5106,0.8025,2021-01-07 00:00:00,8,Although I had read several negative reviews I liked it. OK it wasn't like the rest movies but it was quite good.I agree that it is predictable and more of a teen movie but the trilogy in general is pleasant to spend your time. And I'm surprised that I hadn't heard of this movie before..... I suppose that some people did not want to boost this movie....
" Overall good movie, and a great series
",0.7906,0.4215,2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,"For whatever reason I dislike the main actress, I think another actress would have done a much better job. Other than that, I like every aspect of these three movies."
" Messy and overly confusing
",-0.5267,-0.5881,2020-12-06 00:00:00,3,"As enjoyed the original Divergent film and finding the sequel Insurgent lesser, but now after watching this third instalment. It is quite easily the worst of the franchise. The plot is quite simple and the sci-fi and visuals are very nice but the plot doesn't offer much of interest. A rather confusing full of ""twists"" which are brought up but doesn't offer much explanations.Jeff Daniels introduction character was rather irritating and doesn't offer anything but a standard villain. Less action and more so drama in this film as opposed to the previous two. And an ending which was apparently left as a cliffhanger but seeing as this film flopped there won't be another installation."
" WORST ENDING EVER
",-0.6249,-0.8402,2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,Waste of time. The movies kept getting worse and worse. Most anticlimactic ending I've ever seen.
" Not bad at all!
",0.484,0.8898,2020-10-23 00:00:00,7,"All this kind of movies now always got compared to Hunger games, personally for me this one is not worse, maybe even better. What gets to me it is way too many unnecessary kinda romantic conversations, just for the sake of making films longer, or to attract chick flicks crowd...Anyhow, entertaining enough!"
" Totally Underated
",0.0,0.9637,2020-10-02 00:00:00,9,"I think people were sick of this type of film after being gagged with the Hinger Games but this is a great trilogy. I raised my rating after my second watch 5 yrs later and sure it's full of plot holes. It happens when you try to hring a book to screen. But apparently the critics and kiddies weren't intelligent enough to have fun and how it also challenges our screwed up social order. Watch it. You'll enjoy it compared the the trash we've seen recently. We were during a Eric's of great movies back then but in hindsight, watching the trash movies for the past two yrs you realize it's a good flick .. all 3. And these young actors, now all famous and proven, were great!
The hate is group think. Watch it with an open mind as with all movies and ask yourself if you were bored for a single moment in the 6 plus hours of these movies. Watching them together is definitely a plus."
" Great story

" What a disappointment!
",-0.5562,0.8537,2020-09-14 00:00:00,3,"I really loved Divergent (the first film of the series). The acting was engaging, the plot was interesting, and the CGI was believable. The second film (Insurgent) was very enjoyable as well. This final film seemed like it was not even a part of the series. It was THAT bad. You'd have to see it to believe it: it's unbelievably bad."
" Did somewhat justice to the books, but you can see less enthusiasm in the actors
",0.6667,0.8105,2020-07-10 00:00:00,6,"I love the books, I read them after hte movie, oops! This 3rd movie is BY FAR THE WORST ONE but thankfully saved by the unique storyline. Biggest problem: the events were NOT CONNECTED and felt like staggering stages of episodes all put together in a movie, but worse than that! I know the actors can do better!"
" What's all the negativity for?!
",-0.5562,0.7271,2020-07-03 00:00:00,7,"So the matrix, hunger games and twilight all differed from the first film to the last as the story unfolds! Why should this be any different?! If you can't follow the plot then watch it again until you do. It's pretty simple to be honest and in my opinion a great third (first part) chapter. The problem is money hungry fat cats deciding to split the final part of the trilogy to make more money for themselves. Greed is the reason this franchise has stalled/""failed"". I'm gutted I won't get to see a final part as I enjoyed how this film ended on a cliffhanger. Either way, I enjoyed watching the films and Woodley is kinda hot on the eye too. What a babe. Girl next door meets superwoman. Hopefully as fans we'll get some closure at some point money hungry fools realise it's not all about them but the people watching. It is how they make a living after all."
" Allegiant
",0.0,-0.9046,2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,"So... Without spoiling the book OR this movie; the movie sucked, the book did not. There is way, way more sci-fi then necessary, and BAD sci-fi that is! It's really poorly done, bad CGI and stuff. And where the story from the books was at times confusing, this was downright dumb and mad no sense. The biggest book-moments were cut out, probably to make room for the bad CGI... I kind of expected it to be bad, 'cause the 2nd one wasn't that good either. It also seems the actors get less and less convincing with each movie. Contrary to the Hunger Games (that also differed from the books somewhat, but functional imho), these don't live up to the books at all. If you read them, don't watch the movies. If you've watched the movies but started liking them less and less, read the books instead! They're worth it!"
" i think it was amazing
",0.5859,0.9109,2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,I honestly loved this movie. before i watched it i actually read the reviews and ratings and everyone said it was horrible but i personally loved it so much. it continues the story but adds more to it and it adds more elements. overall one of my my favorite series and would watch it again.
" Real drop off from first two!
",-0.3382,-0.8405,2020-05-21 00:00:00,6,"Allegiant was rather disappointing considering i really enjoyed the first 2 movies. This one was very lackluster on the action and Tris character was much less involved in the plot. I hate the fact that this movie ended on a cliffhanger though. Because it has been 4 years ago and due to the bad box office this film got, there has been no real try to make a fourth and final film."
" Untapped potential
",0.0,0.9738,2020-05-19 00:00:00,7,"So much untapped potential, just like the previous two films.'Allegiant' is a frustrating watch. I mentioned in my review for 'Insurgent' that I liked the way that ended and hoped they'd build on it here. For the vast majority, they unfortunately don't. They do expand the world slightly which is a positive, but not nowhere near to close enough; it's basically just a stone's throw down the road.The cast are all fine, Shailene Woodley (Tris) remains the best of the bunch but no-one gives an exceptional performance sadly. Jeff Daniels is a promising addition, though he doesn't even begin to set the world alight in terms of conviction; a very one-dimensional character.No surprise to see a fourth film cancelled. Even though I don't actually mind these films in the grand scheme of things, they are certainly a disappointment as it's a helluva missed opportunity to create an outstanding franchise."

Brewing something great like the TV series Lost.Insurgent, started to go on a little bit but made me feel there might be a good point to this all.Then Allegiant has left me feeling much like I did at the end of season six in LOST. Angry and disappointed with the amount of time I'd spent and invested in a series that was ultimately pointless with no conclusion. I'm still left wondering what the hell actually happened."

Once free - perhaps the only few moments of tension in the film - they hook up with a group of ostensibly like-minded rebels; but are they who they say they are? Seeds of suspicion are sewn that test the relationship between Theo & Shailene; and frankly the patience of the viewer. Jeff Daniels tries hard to inject some menace as ""David"" but Miles Teller ""Peter"" is just plain irritating. We are clearly heading for a grand-scale denouement, but where is it? Instead someone decided to leave us with some ambiguity (I suspect a fourth in the franchise may have been, at one stage, on the cards?) The actors are going through the motions as though they, too, can't wait for the conclusion so they can all go home for ice cream. It looks good, they look good, but it isn't much good..."

It's the kind of music you want to put on a playlist and listen to when you're at the gym because it gets you pumped. The plot is also the most exciting of all the films as well. There is one problem I have with the film, though, and that is Miles Teller's acting. He was terrible in the other movies in the series, he was terrible in ""Fantastic Four,"" and he's terrible here. He tries to be the comic relief, but it just comes off as bland and trying too hard. It's like watching Hayden Christianson in the ""Star Wars"" prequels. The villains in the movie are also kind of weak. They could have been written a lot better. But, it's a fun action movie with a great score, and I'm excited to see the conclusion of the series next year.

The acting was great and Miles Teller made me laugh, Ansel Elgort was really great along with Zoe Kravitz, and Naomi Watts. They each added to the story in important ways. Theo and Shailene were once again terrific as Four and Tris. The CGI wasn't the best but it still added a cool element to the story. The scenery was interesting and caught my eye.

It's about finding ones identity, about the pressures put on young people to make them fit into cookie cutter stereotypes that people want them to be to conform to ""normal"" society and not cause trouble by having a mind of their own and for thinking outside the box. It's about being at that age where every choice you make determines the rest of your life and feeling the pressure and weight of fear you get when you have to make those decisions.

" Flawed, but underrated
",0.0,0.9406,2020-01-25 00:00:00,10,"After the message the people of Chicago receive from the Outside at the end of Insurgent, Tris and Four gather together a group of people to travel beyond the Wall to find out what's really going on and to see if the people Out There can help set them free. After a daring escape, they find a group of people who assure them that they want to help them with their rebellion. But there's something suss going on not only in their new-found allies but back in Chicago and Four isn't sure that their new buddies are all that trustworthy, causing a rift between Tris and him. Are they really trustworthy? What exactly are their new-buddies actual plans for them? And will they be able to set the world free?
Unfortunately, almost none of these questions are answered - because of this movie's fatal flaw: they tried to copy other popular movies and divide the finale into two movies instead of keeping it as one. Now, that may work for stuff like The Hunger Games and Infinity War and Endgame, but it doesn't work here, and another problem being, this trilogy started being released around a similar time to The Hunger Games, which caused it to suffer. Or more specifically, for the last movie to suffer.
Plus, the Divergent trilogy wasn't the most original to begin with. It follows along similar storylines that other dystopian movies follow, which also didn't help. But, it does manage to provide an interesting enough story to stand on it's one - until it decided to try and copy The Hunger Games and divide the finale into two. That was it's biggest mistake. And as a result, we will never find out what was coming next (as you can't just go read the book as the movies are different enough to them that you can't just go read them and go 'oh, I know what's going to happen next'). If Allegiant had simply done the final chapter all in one movie, then it wouldn't have mattered if it had still flopped as at least we'd all know what would happen next.
Another flaw in this is the fact that, while providing some different stuff and enough to keep us interested and to warrant a '10', ""Allegiant"" ultimately follows the same pattern that all the other dystopian trilogies I've watched and read follow (with the notable exception of the Maze Runner book trilogy).
Other than that, it boasts great visuals, interesting concepts and themes, great acting, and some questions that, while the story may or may not be all that much, still needed to be answered."

",0.2732,0.9658,2019-10-17 00:00:00,4,"I watched the complete trilogy, to understand why these movies few years back were so popular. I don't like judging something, without watching it before, so I have decided to take the painful decision to waste 6 hours of my time (2 hours per movie).I reviewed also the previous two chapters and the weakest point is always the acting. Shailene Woodley is simply not cutted to be an actress, and after three movies, I think I have the right to say so: she is not expressive at all, you cannot bound or even feel something for her character. In all three chapters she has the same exact face from the beginning until the end. And she is one of the lead actresses. Theo James was slightly better this time (maybe because he was less present in the movie), but still not an acceptable performance as main character. The rest of the cast was not better, and unfortunately this time no Kate Winslet was available to patch things up.The story is nothing extraordinary, but this time the narration expanded, and after two chapters setted in Chicago, we finally get to see what there is beyond the wall. There was an improvement in CGI effects: I really liked the representation of the apocalyptic world, and of course The Bureau and Providence cities. At least this time they've used the green screen properly. Also action scenes and stunts were good, I wish they had the same quality in the other two movies too.Do I suggest this series? Absolutely not. This is some wannabe Sci Fi for young teenager, that don't even know what Science Fiction is. The open ending of this title was clearly meant for a sequel, that luckily was never made (and let's hope that they will never make)."

The film takes parts here and there of the two previous installments. It was another kind of the Hunger Games variant , based in a dystopian future world of a strict cast system . It attempts to close the thrilling trilogy , but it ends regularly , including flaws and failures .Starring Shailene Woodley gives nice acting as the valiant teen who is really haunted by her past, as well as she must confront her inner demons.

Though the movies did not, and in behalf of all the fans and audience who read the divergent series we would have much rather been deprived of a movie series than been given this piece of garbage.Every thing in this movie screams cheesy which to me can only mean that whoever created this disrespectful monstrosity did not even care or even respect the books enough to glance at the plot or how it is undergone throughout each book let alone care about the story to begin with.If there are any directors out there who would like to remake this movie to pick up the shreds of brilliance this movie ripped from the book than please take the chance, I would even volunteer to take part in it! This is not a sci-fi fantasy book, it is an inventive dystopia."
" Beyond the wall
",0.0,0.9879,2019-07-21 00:00:00,7,"After the events of the previous film Evelyn, Four's mother, has taken control of Chicago and has banned anybody from going beyond the city wall. Those who sided with Erudite are to be tried, and if found guilty executed; this includes Tris's brother Caleb. He is rescued by Tris and Four and along with Peter and a couple of others they flee the city only to discover a wasteland. Just as they start to think they might be doomed they are met by soldiers from the 'Bureau of Genetic Welfare' and taken to their home city. This city has technology far in advance of anything in Chicago and it is soon explained how Chicago is their experiment; everything that happens there is observed. Its inhabitants are considered genetically damaged but Tris is 'pure' so is taken to see David, the city's leader. At first David seems benevolent but it isn't long before Four has he doubts... our protagonist will have to fight again if they are to save the people of Chicago.I must say this is probably the weakest of the three 'Divergent' films and not just because it is a final film in the series which was meant to have another and thus sets things up for a finale that never happened. Other problems include the fact that Chicago is technologically so far behind the Bureau of Genetic Welfare whose tech is too sci-fi in comparison. We also have the very sudden breakdown of the established order in Chicago and for me the most irritating... the group continue to trust the weasel Peter who betrayed them before and doesn't waste long before doing it again. That said I don't think this was actually a bad film; just less than I hoped for. I liked that there was a good explanation as to why people in Chicago could be so easily categorised and that there was enough exciting action to keep me interested. The cast was solid; most notable Shailene Woodley and Theo James as Tris and Four. The effects are decent although some are more what one would expect in a good TV show rather than a big budget film. Overall I'd say that I enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the previous instalments in the series... just a pity we never got the concluding film as too many plot lines are unresolved."

You can just listen to most of this without even watching at all and you'd most likely get most of the visuals spot on or probably better presented in your mind's eye. It's one clichÃ© after another. At one point they even managed to rip-off The Hunger Games. (Come on guys, seriously? And they screwed it up as well btw because it was totally out of place. Hilarious...) And the other side, the ""new world"", is hella lame. NOt any interesting characteristic in it. Don't waste your time on this pre-chewed, inspiration-less attempt at fantasy.

Sci-fi can never go wrong if it sticks to a main storyline. the movie was lost already in the beginning. Sad but true. It could have had so much potential. Too much disjointed things going on, bad scripts, undedicated acting and no graphics at all. Sure, certain things do not have to make sense all the time, but this was just wrong."
" A film that should be a strong finish to an OK series.
",0.7378,0.9792,2019-03-08 00:00:00,4,"For those following along at home, Allegiant is the third film based on the third book in the Divergent series. As I have made comparisons to The Hunger Games in each installment of these reviews, I will continue to not disappoint. Seems to me that the trend of splitting the last book of a literary series into two movies is annoyingly out of hand. Sure, having written the end of my own trilogies, I know there's a lot of plot and sub-plots to bring to a conclusion. I also know that much of the Divergent series didn't feel like it really did or said anything. Sure, there's the nod to some political statement or worldview that's relevant today, but honestly I want something that only the survivors of a post-apocalyptic future should have to solve.Where the previous two films in this series really excelled in their portrayal of ""simulations"", this film had absolutely none of them. This was a problem, mainly because the strength of the previous two films relied on the characters growing through their overcoming of the simulations. In this film, there seems to be no character development at all (and annoying Peter (Miles Teller) is still around), and even the CGI, which was pretty good in the prior films, felt flat and obvious (even to the point of being distracting). Sorry, Robert Schwentke, but this was not your best work.Similarly, while this film does stop at a good place to allow the ""part 2"" conclusion to wrap up next year, I still feel lost as to what is happening and who the clear antagonist of this whole post-apocalyptic future is (which is a problem I had with the last movie). Maybe once I read the book this was based on I'll be able to give a better assessment, but for right now I'm pretty much done with this series.In a film that should be a strong finish to an OK series, I give Allegiant 2.0 stars out of 5."

",0.0,-0.9447,2019-01-28 00:00:00,2,"I already wasted too much time and words on the ""Divergent""-series, which was quite mediocre and dull to begin with, and the third entry ""Allegiant"" is the absolute low point of the trilogy. Therefore, in terms of plot, I will restrict myself to the main highlights. Naomi Watts replaces Kate Winslet as the megalomaniac Ã¼ber-evil wench, Theo James probably complained about his inferior sidekick role in the previous instalment and gets to be a hero again, and Jeff Daniels plays his most idiotic role since ""Dumb and Dumber"". Everything else is the same type of predictable dystopian guff targeted at teenage girls who grew tired of ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"".Tris and her clique, including useless brother Caleb and the treacherous Peter who backstabbed them at least 15 times already, climb over the prison wall that surrounds futuristic Chicago and head out to seek remnants of a better civilization. They find civilization, alright, a highly sophisticated one that has been orchestrating the entire Faction system and watched the devastating wars like a reality show on TV! Leader David fools Tris into believing that her 100% divergence is key to end all Faction wars, but her toy-boy Four (as well as everybody else with a minimum of intellect) suspects that these snobs aren't the least bit interested in saving the citizens of Chicago. I didn't think it was possible, but the stories of these films become more preposterous while suspense and credibility vanish entirely. The special effects in ""Allegiant"" are pathetic, like for example an invisible portal entrance in the middle of an apocalyptic wasteland or David's flying egg-cooker. If you are older than 16, please go and seek out some genuinely unsettling post-apocalyptic or dystopian Sci-Fi classics, like ""Logan's Run"", ""Silent Running"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" or ""THX-1138"""
" I'm Allergic to this movie
",-0.296,-0.6646,2018-12-12 00:00:00,2,"This movie is trash and RT where right, this movie is worse than Insurgent.ORIGINALITY
In my opinion this movie feels like Divergent all over again.
They are in a place they think is good secrets gets leaked and we find out that those people are liars and they are actually bad.
This movie is really predictable and i knew as soon as Tris meet David that he was a scumbag.PACING
The pacing is cancerous and it made the movie so boring.
All it was, was Tris meeting David and them exchanging boring dialogue.
They never actually tried to develop the characters with the time they had.CHARACTERS
Tris is probably a Mary sue and if not pretty close to being one.
They say that Tris is pure and all the others are damaged and in my opinion it feels like they are changing the premise and the lore of Divergent instead of expanding it but it's just my opinion.
But i don't like how Tris is so perfekt and that she is 100% pure and everyone else is damaged, they make her out to be this really special person and that makes the character a little bit worse in my opinion.
But she is a bland character who dosen't bring anything to the story.
Four is better but still bland.
I would have liked it more if Four was the main character of this movie cause he would be fitting and he actually develops a little bit as a character.
Peter is the best character in this movie cause he turns his back on others to benefit him and that's amazing.
It shows how unstable he is as a character.VILLAIN
The villain is bad and delusional.
His motive is to create peace we need sacrifice things.
I can understand his motive but it dosen't get developed enough to be a good motive and that makes him a pretty bad villain.
and why he is delusional is because he said that he has seen everything Tris has done in Chicago and he still says that the faction system is the only way to create peace.VERDICT
Skip this horrible movie"
" The worst end of a trilogy...
",-0.6249,-0.788,2018-11-03 00:00:00,3,"""Allegiant"" is the third movie of The Divergent Series in which we watch Tris trying to escape with Four from Chicago. In order to do that they have to pass from the big wall that encircles Chicago. After their escape, they discover shocking truths of the world around them. A very big battle is ready to start beyond the walls of Chicago which threaten all of humanity and they don't know who to trust and what to do about it.Since I had seen the previous two movies of this trilogy I have to admit that I had high hopes from this movie and I was let down by it. I have to mention that I really liked the first movie because it was something very different from any other movie I had seen. The second movie was an average one and now the third movie is the worst. I did not like the plot because it was boring at many points with no plot twists and not a lot of scenes that would have made this movie interesting. The combination of a not well-written script with a poor direction which was made by Robert Schwentke did not give this movie a chance of becoming interesting. The interpretation of Theo James who played once more as Four was not enough to save the movie and the poor interpretation of Shailene Woodley's drag him down.Finally, I have to say that ""Allegiant"" is not a nice movie to watch and I believe that if you are going to watch it you will be disappointed by it. I really do not recommend anyone to watch it since I am sure that you are going to waste your time. Even if you are a true fan of this movie series or even of the books I think that you won't enjoy it."

Unfortunately, the film didn't get great reviews which caused the next film to be cut. Funny, but now was the time to watch the film because the storyline is more about how your point of view is shaped based on your environment. So many of us don't look outside of our News Media that we watch normally and the writers that we read to consider the world may be much different that we may think.

Together with a group of friends, they venture into the unknown, while what they're about to find out is very surprising, to say the least.In this third and also last part of the Divergent series, we follow the protagonists as the begin to understand the truth about their city, the wall and their ancestors. As expected, not everything will prove to be as pleasant as it seems, so they will soon find themselves in a position which asks for immediate action.Unfortunately, as it has become quite a habit when it comes to franchises, if the first move is good or a success, the others that will follow will have a quite steep tendency of losing essence, thus being worse. The same can be said about this one as well. What they discover and most of the explanations given are the only interesting part of this one, the rest often leaving the impression that it is there only as a filler. The main characters' implication is drastically reduced, especially when it comes to Tris', making them seem like spectators in the plot, rather than main contributors.Speaking of the plot, it is mediocre at best and it only manages to generate suspense a bit in the beginning until the great mystery is unfold. Afterwards, it falls into the predictable and obvious trap from where it just won't rise again. You get to care about the characters less as times goes by, leaving the viewer to wait for the finale without a true feeling. There are also quite a few plot holes and unexplainable phenomenon but it is to be expected considering the overall quality.I cannot understand what happened with the whole awesomeness, emotion, drama, action and suspense from the first instalment. How could they have deviated so much from the original formula, which I consider great, and end up with this one. To be honest, if it wasn't for the suspense generated by its predecessors and its still impressive CGI, it would have been an awful movie.As I see it now, it managed to be quite average, even below, ending the series quite disappointingly from my point of view. You're left with an average movie which could have been a lot better from many points of view, especially the plot, as the series deserved."

The film had great 1984 style lines like, ""Your destiny begins today."" I kept attempting to get a theme from the film such as the role of propaganda and recreating the past for the betterment of a diverse society, but it was presented lightly if indeed it was meant to be there. Perhaps those who read the books could shed some light on the theme.Guide: No swearing, sex, or real nudity.

Especially I admired the the third movie Allegiant. It is directed by Robert Schwentke and, like its two predecessors, Divergent and Insurgent, its stars Shailene Woodly in the title role as Tris and Theo James as Four. After the earth-shattering revelations of Insurgent, Tris must escape with Four and go beyond the wall enclosing Chicago. For the first time ever, they will leave the only city and family they have ever known. Once outside, old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless with the revelation of shocking new truths. Tris and Four must quickly decide who they can trust as a ruthless battle ignites beyond the walls of Chicago which threatens all of humanity. In order to survive, Tris will be forced to make impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice and love. Woodly and James give superb performances. As you'd expect, the film is epic, fast-moving, heart-moving and visually spectacular with jaw- dropping and tear dropping stunt scenes. Definitely it is a thought- provoking movie. However it has its weaknesses. Without reading the book or seeing first two movies, it might have too far-fetching story. Also in some places it is a little bit confusing on whose side somebody like Peter (Miler Teller) or Matthew (Bill Skarsgard) are. Just a little bit confusing, finally of course it all comes out. That said, this is the best Divergent trilogy movie of all time. Far more entertaining and thrilling, its heart-dropping relationship between Tris and Four make the film even more enjoyable.

Say what you will about Shailene Woodley but casting her as the lead in this series was wrong. She does not have the fire that a Tris should have. There are moments of determination that she displays in the appropriate scenes but that was about it. So this has been a distraction for me throughout. As far as knowing what would happen ahead of time, there are multiple scenes where this is the case. I like to be surprised by the depth of thought that a writer had in constructing a scene to show that my simple mind was not imaginative enough to determine an ending to a scene which was unexpected. This is OK because that is what I pay for to see a movie. But in this one, I was rarely surprised with dramatic outcomes of critical scenes. This leaves me wondering who watched this before releasing it to the public, children ? I mean some adult executive had to screen this movie and had said - great, let's go with it. If you're wondering about the 4 star rating, I am a sucker for special effects and there were a few in this movie that were pretty good and enjoyable. Otherwise, pass on this one and hope another sequel is not in the works."
" Box office bust or fan favorite boom?
",0.6486,0.9919,2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,"As an avid reader, I love to see how directors can take words and create the images in our head. The Divergent series was one of my favorite reads a few years back, so when they decided to put the words on screen, I was more than ecstatic. Opening day for the original Divergent, had me excited of the follow ups, especially Allegiant which was released in 2016. However, after the release of Divergent, many people were disappointed and it created a loss for future production of the remaining movies in the series. Despite others saying they would not be in attendance to watch Allegiance, I stuck through it to prove that the books I loved dearly would be successful on screen. According to the plot line of the original book, the movie lined up very well with how Roth wanted it to pan out. I believe it was a good depiction of how we were supposed to imagine the story panning out. However, I knew the box office sales would not reflect how great I thought the movie was. It was even nominated for 8 awards. Someone had to agree with me then! So despite how tragic the monetary value was from the movie, I believe it deserves more credit and a better rating."
" A series running on fumes
",-0.0258,0.8979,2017-03-12 00:00:00,5,"If there was a case for young adult adaptation are all the same and blend together then Allegiant can be used as evidence, borrowing elements from The Hunger Games and Maze Runner series.After the events of Insurgent the faction system has broken down after the people have found out that Chicago was no more than an experiment. Tris (Shailene Woodley) wants to see the outside world and together with her boyfriend, Four (Theo Jones), brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort), friends Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Tori (Maggie Q) and Peter (Miles Teller - the term friend is being used very loosely) go over the wall and discover a civilisation of scientific advance people lead by David (Jeff Daniels) who explains how the world felt into chaos and why Tris is so special. But, David has his own motives.I had a soft spot for the Divergent series until now: the first two films were solid films for their target audience and had some fun trippy Inception style scenes in the mindscape. Yet the good will that the series has built has spent and Allegiant used ideas from Mockingjay and The Maze Runner sequels, that people secretly exist beyond the world and they are not to be trusted whilst the desert landscape is like the one in The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, just with much worst CGI.Allegiant even rips off the previous films in the series. The climax is similar to what happened in the first two films, the heroes have to break into the central governmental building to stop the villain's scheme and free either friends or family. Insurgent was able to get away with this because there was enough of a different because Tris was stuck in the dreamscape to open mystery box.Allegiant relies on the characters to be idiots for the plot to continue, especially Tris who should have been more sceptical of the mysterious people who have been watching Chicago, not less. She was both the chosen saviour who had enhanced instincts yet also be incredibly gullible.The relief in Allegiant is the world fell apart was humanity split between genetically enhanced people and regular people. Basically it was a cross between Gattaca, X-Men and the Animatrix short The Second Renaissance. Humanity split into factions because the genetically enhanced got corrupted, making some virtues greater at the expense of others, making them 'damaged'. Tris is told she's the cure for the 'damaged' and like the kids in the Maze Runner series being the cure for the zombie outbreak. Even for a sci-fi film this is a stretch and Allegiant does not mitigate the criticism the series has suffered that the faction system doesn't make any sense: if anything the revelation makes the concept harder to swallow.Allegiant shows that the Divergent film series has run its course. It has run out of ideas and the low Rotten Tomatoes score and box office returns has put paid to the idea that there would be a sequel: although there would be a sense of schadenfreude to see big- name and emerging actors forced to appear in a TV movie."
" Allegiant
",0.0,0.9517,2017-03-12 00:00:00,6,"It was a decent movie, but my colleagues and I did manage to find some problems. Firstly, we were unclear on how the regular, non- genetically modified people were able to dispatch the corrupted, genetically modified security guards in hand to hand combat with relative ease. It seems if humanity had developed advanced genomic modification technology, employing security guards who cannot be manhandled by Theo James would be a fairly simple task. Unrelated, it seems like Miles Teller's character, Peter, turns evil in like every movie. His character's lack of meaningful development really is a downer for all the pretentious kiss-ups who watch these movies, who may be led led to believe that they can never change. Also, why do the main characters keep letting him make decisions? It doesn't really make sense. Finally, the film revolves around the so-called ""Chicago Experiment,"" which, if I may be candid, seems like one of the most egregious examples of researchers ignoring the scientific method and all control standards put in place by the organizations that govern international science. I don't understand why a study of that global significance would be organized in a non double-blind procedure without multiple control groups and extensive peer review. In the movie, however, there doesn't even appear to be an independent variable. Also, the entire approval process is four people talking to two other people, one of which is literally the result of said experiment. It just seems like they're asking for bureaucratic overreach. Anyways, we've already sent our concerns to Lionsgate, and we assume they are working tirelessly to fix these problems."
" such a great film!
",0.6588,0.9925,2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,I know people have their opinions about these movies...but I love them because there fun and energetic and they are very entertaining. I love the chemistry between all the characters together and it is such a fun action packed movie. I will always love these movies because they are fun and entertaining and the actors own that and they have fun with it. The movies have such a great message and I will always love them.
" Review of Alligiant - No Spoilers (Assuming you've seen previous movies)
",-0.296,0.9635,2017-02-19 00:00:00,3,"This movie is out right horrible. Not recommend.The actors were OK but below average. Liked Four, mostly from previous ones but he was average in this one. The movie is way to SCI-FIish, turns me off to be honest. I like more, less-love obsessed movies, Tris is just to much in Love with Four. Usuall stuff, always the newer movie in the series = the worse. Look to Dumb & Dumber 2 or Star Wars (My opinion)Actors: 3 / 10+ Half decent, below Average. Kinda how Justin Bieber would perform if he was given the chance Scenery: 5 / 10+ Cool and Awesome effects, very cool graphical layout with a futuristic look To much futuristic theme, should be more balanced. They focused more on graphics than plot Storyline (Events): 1 / 10This was the worst with the move, since this is without spoilers. I'll just say I did not like the whole turn of movie. How it twisted and such. Do not like the character that Shailene Woodley played."
" I didn't think this movie was based on book, not a video game
",0.0,0.9458,2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"When I saw the first divergent movie, I really liked it and I became really excited to see the adaptions of the next two books (insurgent and allegiant).But after I saw the 2nd movie, it was a lot different from the book and I started to get confused on why it wasn't going to be like how the first movie was. But after I saw this movie,I realized that it was nothing like what it was based on and it looked liked it was based on a video game.I became really disappointed on how the divergent series became a series I don't recognize anymore.If Divergent just became a TV show instead of a movie before the first movie came out, then it would have had a better chance at being more popular and talked a lot about. But that never happened."
" Another ridiculous movie
",-0.3612,-0.9961,2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"I am trying to keep from falling asleep from this boring, stupid, stupid, did I say stupid movie. Asinine, ridiculous, this movie could be renamed, ""How to bore your audience to death"" or ""Movie for braindead corpses"". I feel stupid for watching this so called 'movie'. And I am watching it for free and I still want my money back. Terrorist groups don't need any old torture devices, they can use this movie. Bad acting, check. Stupid plot line, check. Very big, gigantic plot holes that make absolutely no sense, check. You don't care if everyone in the movie does a horrible, painful death, check. Through out the movie you will roll your eyes, sigh heavenly, saying things like ""Why are they doing that?"" and ""That makes no sense."", check. Â**Spoilers, you knew the one chick was going to die when they got on top of the wall. No bullets hit Tris or Four although they were being shot at at close range and with machine guns, and they didn't get shot as they climbed up the wall. Despite the land outside the wall being completely jacked up from nuclear war, the land is completely toxic, yet people are able to survive on the fridges in tents!!!Where were they getting food and water!!! These people are supposedly exposed to all kinds of toxic fumes, toxic land but they all look normal!!!? Oh, but the Genetic Manipulation place was able to survive the nuclear fall out and create a grass growing (again ON WHAT IF THE WHOLE WORLD IIS A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST!!!) And the motivations for the characters, stupid, stupid, stupid. David, who you KNEW and the new section were evil. Absolutely nothing shocking. You knew who was going to die, you knew who was evil. And why did Four go back to Chicago? And how did he survive walking through the nuclear wasteland with no issues!! We are living in the last days, common sense is out, insane people rule the world and make the movies. Finding an actual good these days is like trying to find the holy Grail or a needle in a haystack."
" some more explanation

Johanna (Octavia Spencer) starts organizing an opposition. Tris (Shailene Woodley) breaks out her brother Caleb with the help of Four (Theo James). Peter (Miles Teller) forces his way onto their escape plan. They are joined by Christina but Tori is killed. Outside of Chicago, they find forces under David (Jeff Daniels) who is conducting the experiment to 'fix' human genes.I don't read the books. I'm not a big fan of the first two movies. I don't believe in the world being built by the franchise. It never made sense to me. In this sequel, the world is expanding and an explanation is presented. While this world is still problematic, it finally makes some internal logic. It's still dumb. I do like Woodley and she has the charisma to lead. This is not a favorite franchise to start and it's losing even more steam."
" Better than Insurgent, but still no good
",0.4588,-0.621,2017-01-18 00:00:00,4,"ALLEGIANT is the third film in the DIVERGENT series, following on from the rubbish INSURGENT. Originally there were meant to be four films in the franchise but this film did so badly at the box office that there's talk of the fourth film being a TV movie which will be interesting to say the least. I really don't like this franchise at all, finding it a mere rip-off of THE HUNGER GAMES which was itself a teen-friendly rip-off of BATTLE ROYALE, but the good news is that ALLEGIANT is much better than the last film in the series, although that doesn't make it good.INSURGENT was all about predictability and mindless action whereas ALLEGIANT at least has a plot of sorts, even if it isn't a very good one. The same problems that exist with the first two films are also present here, with too much time given over to teen moping around and all of the established adult stars limited to showing up, intoning a few lines of dialogue, and disappearing again. Shailene Woodley makes for an ultra-annoying heroine and hardly someone you can root for. The running time is overlong and too much of the story is padded out with scenes of characters travelling around. The thing that annoys me is the needless way they throw in CGI shot after CGI shot as if that's going to hold the attention; the bit where they float about in those giant bubbles is the nadir of this film. Still, some of the sub-plots are mildly interesting, and at least this film appears to be going somewhere which is better than normal for the franchise."
" The Divergent Series just became something with Allegiant
",0.0,0.9813,2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"In my reviews to the first two sequels I harshly criticized the movies, for a reason of course. The first two movies were a disappointment when it comes to action, tension, visual effects and the plot. However, Allegiant is something completely different. I can hardly believe the progress they made since the first two parts of the movie. The plot became much more original and exciting, tension-building devices were awesome, visual effects great and what we have as a result is a a compact whole which works perfectly fine on the screen.What I really liked about this movie is that it is much richer with emotions and sentiment. Mother's love, family, friendship, betrayal, everything is served here and it really touches your heart. Something I definitely didn't feel with the previous two Divergent movies.As you can see my rating for the movie is 9/10, because I still don't like the choice of the female protagonist. Her acting got better this time, but still she is such a baby face for the role. And also some parts of the movie were a bit predictable and clichÃ©d. That's why I cannot give it a 10.But I highly recommend you going through a bit of torturing with the first sequel of the series and a part of the second, because you will be rewarded with the astonishing third part. I hope they will keep up the good work with the last sequel of the movie. And I am definitely getting the books."
" ""Divergent"" series falls apart with misguided ""penultimate""installment
",0.0,0.8785,2017-01-04 00:00:00,3,"Chances are if you've made it to this third installment of the ""Divergent"" series, you're pretty 'allegiant' to Veronica Roth's teen dystopia books. Or you just like watching the sweaty shirtless backs of Shailene Woodley and Theo James. Either way, no judgment here. I voluntarily watched it.Director Robert Schwentke returns to the series after making ""Insurgent,"" which he handled with acceptable competence. In ""Allegiant,"" he gets an even lesser script to work with and can't do much of anything to counter how far-flung the story has gotten at this point â both Roth's actual story and the film's reworked version of it.With the goal of turning around these films annually, the studio turned to new writers and asked them to not only adapt the series finale, but split it up into two parts, and only write part one (as far as we know). This task, given to Adam Cooper and Bill Collage (""Exodus: Gods & Kings,"" ""The Transporter Refueled"") and Noah Oppenheim (""The Maze Runner"") â and possibly another writer who didn't end up getting a credit on the film â pretty much writes the film's death sentence. ""Allegiant"" the book has its problems, as Roth cracks open the world she intricately built in the first two books and places her characters in an almost completely new world with whole new stakes. We follow Tris (Woodley) and Four (James) as they break out into the ""fringe,"" where they eventually discover the Bureau of Genetic Welfare and learn of the circumstances that led to the development of the world they were born into. During their field trip beyond the fence, however, war looms back in the city where Evelyn's (Naomi Watts) Factionless are at odds with those clinging to the old way of life.Despite a couple different story lines and a large portion of the story that splits up Tris and Four (which no Hollywood studio would allow to happen for a significant length of screen time), there really aren't two good movies worth of material without expounding significantly. Rather than adding compelling new material, however, the script just draws out certain inevitable ""twists"" from the book and ensures the story's plot points play out in action-friendly ways. Actually, almost the entire plot of the book gets used except the ending, which is lopped off to make room for a rousing fourth movie that has no precedent in the novel.So not only is it a forced script (Jeff Daniels is awesome when he gets the dialogue, but watching him in this versus an Aaron Sorkin project is like night and day), but it deviates enough from the book to confound the only people still watching the series â the book's fans. Not a wise choice.""Insurgent"" nearly zapped the film of any character-driven elements and in ""Allegiant"" there's almost none of them. The best opportunity Woodley gets to act is a weirdly long decontamination shower scene. The script doesn't entirely lose the conflict between Tris and Four, but it's short-lived and ineffective. A plot device rather than the core of the narrative. The first-person perspective of the novels was always going to make these films difficult to adapt. It showed with ""Insurgent."" But the quality of the popcorn-munching elements drops off in ""Allegiant,"" in part due to fatigue and in part because the story doesn't resemble its former self. The story and backdrop can change if the characters' journeys stay intact, but that was already falling apart before cameras rolled on ""Allegiant.""You'll be ready to be done with the ""Divergent"" series come the end of this one, and seeing as it's the third film in a book trilogy, you kind of expect to be relieved of that burden, but alas. Whatever Lionsgate/Summit can throw together for ""Ascendant"" won't be worth watching, save for the final moments so fans can have *some* closure.~Steven CThanks for reading!
