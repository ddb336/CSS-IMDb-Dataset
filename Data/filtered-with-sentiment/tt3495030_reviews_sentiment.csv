" 90s Nostalgia
",0.0,0.9735,2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,"One of the best films to come out of YRF banner. 90s generation will identify with that setting, those songs, magic of Kumar Sanu. Anu Malik has dn a fab job with music. Varun Grover's first National award ðŸ¥‡ for Moh moh ke dhaagey. Full marks to Bhoomi & Ayushmann for breathing life into their characters. Such a strong supporting cast - Sanjay Mishra, Sheeba Chaddha, Seema Pahwa, Alka Amin. This film bot Ayushmann back from doldrums. Watch it for beautiful performances n a simple storyline that deals with complexities of self doubt and finding love."

" Dam Laga Ke Haysa lesson: Never marry a Stranger!
",0.0,0.6904,2020-06-27 00:00:00,7,"For me the main lesson we can learn from Dam Laga Ke Haysa is this - DON'T marry a Stranger or someone you don't know properly! More specifically, marrying a STRANGER is one of the most irrational, bizarre and risky ritual that people are brainwashed into! Brides and Grooms are selected as if they are products in the market!When you marry a stranger it's possible that you may end up with a person who is half-mad, a Fraud, a Criminal, Characterless or having some horrible traits because of which it becomes impossible to live with him/her. The stranger may even turn out to be Illiterate or half-educated when you are very Educated!But many married couples remain in that miserable ""prison"" for decades! There are crores of such incompatible couples ""living a LIE"" (in all Conservative societies)!And don't expect that you can participate in some Wife-Carrying sport in your town/village so that your miserable marriage becomes a Happy one!But the movie is Enjoyable though! Just loved some of the ""unintentional Comedy"" in it!Bhumi and Ayushmann have a come a long way since 2015. I feel happy that they are now very, very saleable stars! The Cute, Baby Elephant-like Bhumi now looks Cute, Slim, Stylish and Gorgeous!"
" Underrated Movie
",0.0,0.8439,2020-04-22 00:00:00,10,Ayushman is the gem of bollywood and so is Bhumi Pednekar.One of the best movies of bollywood and deserves more positive reviews
" Totally loved it.
",0.6361,0.9879,2020-03-13 00:00:00,8,"This is a movie that breaks all stereotypes, be it the lead heroine or the love story between the lead pair, still this is a complete entertainer.The story is of Prem(Played by Ayushmann Khuraana) and Sandhya(Bhumi Pednekar). Sandhya is a girl who is overweight and Prem owns a Audio cassette shop.Prem has to get married to Sandhya. But Sandhya is not the type of life partner Prem wants. Sandhya tries to bond with him but he is embarrassed by her. But eventually love blossoms and prem understand the value of real love.Ayushman and Bhumi has done an excellent job in the movie. Director Sharat Katariya has caputred the essence of city as well as 90's nostalgia quite well. The storytelling as well the screenplay is superb. Music deserve a special mention. Be it moh moh ke dhaage or Kumar sanu's 'Tu'. The songs are extremely soulful.All in all an extremely well made movie."

" A triumphant love story
",0.8225,0.9923,2019-07-18 00:00:00,8,"Dum Laga Ke Haisha is a true gem. A film that is so beautifully made whilst providing social commentary about size and regular Indian stereotypes is a film that shouldn't be missed.I applaud Sharat Katariya for making this film. His script is wonderful, full of heartfelt emotion, great characters and creates the 90s atmosphere with so much detail. His direction alongside this brings the film to life. Katariya's attention to detail impressed me a lot. The use of Cassettes, Landline Phones, VCRs and Kumar Sanu feels so reminiscent of the 90s and the portrayal of Uttar Pradesh is so accurate that you feel like you're in the same world as the characters. The characters he's created are fully fleshed out and grounded at all times.Ayushmann Khurrana was brilliant in this film. His emotions accompanied with the way his character is written adds so much depth to his role. Bhumi Pednekar is a clear winner in this movie. As a debut she gives a very realistic and honest performance. Her chemistry with Khurrana is perfect as well. The supporting cast are also great and hilarious especially Sanjay Mishra. Everyone's performances combined makes the story so much more investing as the drama that occurs throughout the film feel real and not over the top.Dum Laga Ke Haisha is a film that needs to be watched. Not only does it have some memorable characters that are realistic, but it also has a strong message about the way one should be treated as well as breaking the rules of Indian stereotypes. Whilst the story may be predictable, it's the characters and mix of emotions that win you over and that what makes this film special."
" One of the few best movies Bollywood delivers!
",0.6696,0.9469,2019-07-02 00:00:00,9,"Every single actor actress performed very well. Natural settings, no artificial emotion, no green screen, overacting at all. This movie tries to portray a lower middle class family of 90s in haridwar, india in most natural way delivering the 100% entertainment. It is quite unfortunate that such movies never hits the 100 crore mark but if you seek for true entertainment, this is the one.As for the soundtracks, it has 90s romantic sadhana & kumar sanu's voice, nooran sister's aggressive sporty one, melodious monali thakur.The actors and actresses are underrated but the overall it's a complete package of entertainment you can watch over and over without getting bored."
" Bollywood should learn from these kinds of movies.
",0.0,0.9606,2019-04-30 00:00:00,10,"In a world full of crap bollywood movies where actors don't even know the meaning of acting .... there are much more talented people trying to make good movies & delivering a positive message too. This movie is a good example of that. Kudos to all the cast , team & Aayushman. Wish i could meet you in person one day. :)"
" Sweet love story.
",0.802,0.9829,2019-04-01 00:00:00,7,"My Rating : 7/10A complete family entertainer with a love story at it's heart. 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha' won the 2015 National Film Award for Best Feature Film (Hindi) and it truly deserves it. The script of 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha' was written in 2007, almost seven years before the release!Superb, authentic performances from the whole cast, special mention goes to Bhumi Pednekar for going the extra mile (who gained 30 kgs to land the role) and transforming herself.Beautiful movie and 'Moh Moh Ke Dhaage' is such a romantic track of recent years. Go watch it guys!"
" Watchable flick
",0.0,0.4404,2019-01-11 00:00:00,6,"It's a watchable flick with a different story line and good acting by Ayushman, Bhumi and the others characters in their families in the movie."
" A short and sweet family movie with a nice message
",0.7003,0.9246,2018-12-30 00:00:00,7,"A good movie doesn't necessarily need a lavish set or big stars. A simple story can be invigorating with a clarity brought through the setting and the theme which enunciates through ""Dum Lagake Haisha."" The film revolves around the tight alleys of Haridwar and Rishikesh set in the 90s. The rugged 90s look and the dialect used in the film gets a while to set its mood. Slowly the sweetness of the drama starts to pour in; and by the end, you feel like re-watching it."
" A perfect story!!!
",0.6784,0.7777,2018-12-20 00:00:00,9,"Throughout the movie, I was totally lost in the awesomeness of this simple and sweet story. There was a constant smile on my face for the last 10-15 minutes. This is the content I am willing to pay for. A nearly perfect story!!"
" Beautiful Movie
",0.5994,0.9508,2018-11-20 00:00:00,8,"Must watch. Good movie very original. Performance wise lead protagonists - Ayushman Khurana and Bhumi Pednekar - are good. More importantly their odd chemistry works. Sanjay Mishra is top notch. Other supporting cast is also noteworthy.

" A Beautiful Love Story
",0.8442,0.9958,2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,"There are all these movies currently doing the rounds in Bollywood that are just flash and no substance. And then there are stories like these. Pure, straight from the heart stories of people that deserve to be watched. This movie belongs to the latter category.India as a country is obsessed with fair skinned, thin people and everyone who falls out of these aesthetic distinctions, are treated as anomalies that are always ridiculed, often in terrible ways. This mentality has trickled down to every strata of society as is seen in this movie.Here, a well-educated girl is ridiculed by her husband simply because she is overweight. Her good qualities are not seen and her weight becomes her identity. What's so sad about this film is that this scenario is 100% true. Prem Prakash Tiwari enters into an arranged marriage setup with Sandhya Verma. At first, Sandhya tries to get to know and love Prem, but he is adamant that he cannot love Sandhya because of the way she looks. His mentality has been moulded in such a way by societal standards that he refuses to introduce his new wife to his neighbors. Over time, this builds a barrier between the two and Sandhya gives up on trying to build a good relationship with him. It is what happens next that is so beautiful about this story. Prem is jolted into a situation where he has to rely on Sandhya and she has to rely on him and then they start to realize what love really is. Looks don't matter. The heart wants what it wants.The acting was spectacular. Ayushmann is fabulous as Prem and even though you want to knock some sense into his character, you cannot harbor bad feelings for him because he is so endearing! Bhumi was very good in her debut role and my heart went out for her. She was beautiful as Sandhya. The supporting cast boasted of acting stalwarts like Sanjay Mishra and each of them were perfect in their roles.This movie deserves a watch. Soulful and heart-warming."
" Arrange marriage turning into epic love story after hiccups!
",0.6696,0.9898,2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Tone, Script & Story: The story is about a couple who get together via arranged marriage along with bunch of other couples. Now the question arises, will their marriage last?It is beautiful to see how two people who lack somewhere in perfectness, try to create something which is perfect and lasts long.The movie highlights a situation which is mostly seen in India (at least till now & I don't know about others countries). The situation is something like divorce is rare. Even if the marriage is arranged, love comes after marriage and it lasts.Love story 'Dum Laga ke Haisha' is here to win your heart.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Music: Better than average. Acting: Everybody associated wins your heart.Final Verdict: The movie highlights how an arrange marriage turns into an epic love story after the hiccups. It is worth watching and adding to your collection."
" Nice little drama with a touch of romance
",0.7506,0.9592,2018-02-10 00:00:00,8,"The movie is full of drama, shouting, hitting and all the mirch masala you could expect from a bollywood movie and the way the whole cast pulls it off is brilliant. Kudos to the casting and directing team for bringing together this brilliant team of actors. The story centers around the life a frustrated boy which could not be done any better than what Ayushman did. The story has its ups and downs but the brilliant acting keeps you engaged throughout. Totally recommend everyone to watch it."
" Dumb Laga ke Haisha film is a nostalgic punch of 80s and 90s
",-0.5106,0.9961,2017-09-05 00:00:00,9,"A family film, after a long time Bollywood has produced a family drama which holds a potential to entice audience to the edge of the seat. Unfortunately this film could not stand on theaters for a long time. Dumb Laga ke Haisha is made with US$2.4 million and generated US$4.8 million on box office. Ayushmann Khurana played a helpless son of a middle-class family. He belongs to the cassette era of Bollywood. He is completely suppressed by his father. They decide his arrange marriage with Bhumi Pednekar. Bhumi played as an educated and independent girl. She has a job in school.The otherwise good above average looking Ayushmann Khurana who is lost in the music of 90s decade paint his dream canvas with colors. He lives in a dream and expects his wife to be beautiful and surrendering. Bhumi who also has her marginal expectations from husband try to woo him with her beauty. Ayushmann Khurana starts neglecting and repainting of marriage. Now the time is gone. It is fun to watch this couple as the decade of 90s is famous for love marriage and early era of globalization. Indian youth was perusing higher studies to go to US as it was the only country on youth's mind. IT revolution was on the way. This film nails at perfect spot of Indian psyche. Quyamat Se Quyamat Taq was the epic of that era. Papa Kehe Te Hain was a hit number. The concept of love marriage was new on that time. Automobile industry was just mushrooming. Hero Honda 100ss and Suzuki were just entered in Indian market to woo the Indian youth. Owning a motorcycle was an archetype of ready to move youngster.Ayushmann Khurana and Bhumi Pednekar fight and Bhumi take lead for separation. This is a new twist of 2015. Girls of that era where always use to love the groom and divorce was not common at that time. In 2015 divorce is a common and part of life. 50% people are getting divorce today and 30% from remaining are not happily married is the reality today. Only 20% people are happily married and staying together. Technically speaking, the stand of Bhumi does not gel in the film but what the hell! Film is for 2015 audience.Audience easily co-relate with the film as the songs are shot with cinematographic precision of 90s. The style of group dance like Greed Drama, Lead actors will remain in focus by color, shape, scale, space or action. Background dancers will enhance the mood with their group dance, design, movements and visual spectacle. After a long time I took a long and deep breath of fresh breeze as the songs were shot on open hill top or on natural bounty. That was the era of comparatively less population and less pollution. Songs are written with considerable background of that era. The music of the film transformed us in to that era.Sharat Katariya the director and screen writer of this film is jhamia Milia Islamia alumnus. He started his career in 2007 with a film, Behja Fry. He has written 8 films so far. Dumb Laga ke Haisha is shot 60% in one house only. It shows the strength of a director. Sharat Karariya who started his career with Bheja Fry with maximum one location film maintained his strength of writing a screenplay. While teaching I always give example of Jean Luc Godard and Robert Bresson for use of location and their shot division, I find Sharat Katariya a new blood screenwriter and director will take Bollywood to new high.Sharat Katariya born on 15 June 1978 a very young and promising director has crafted this film. Although the director as mentioned in interview that he has inspired by a poster of husband carrying wife in a run, true but this film has created the decade of 90s. A character of Ayushmann and Bhumi touches our heart, their personal and social life talks much about their psychological and social built up. This film talks bluntly about the internal complex and external complex of Ayushmann. How Bhumi creates a space in his heart is the beauty of this film. Race sequence and their budding love are wrapped very fast. The first draft of this film was written in 17 days and second in 3 days this itself is a wonder. I think this is a good film for all film lovers. All film school students will learn a lesson out of it."
" superb
",0.6249,0.9839,2017-08-16 00:00:00,9,"Superb and fantastic story. its revealing the dignity of anyone with any look, yet a fine human heart. Superb, loved it very much. Touches heart with emotions. The actress, who is apparently fat gets all the attention and every audience loves her from the heart.Just loved the movie. and i expect, it will change the eyes of the society for perceiving the people in their natural form."
" Pednekar is Fantastic, the Rest of the Movie is Not
",0.5574,0.9768,2017-05-09 00:00:00,4,"Prem (Ayushmann Khurrana) is persuaded by his family to marry for financial reasons to an overweight woman he doesn't find attractive. His new wife, Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar ) is an educated woman who tries to make her marriage work, but Prem has no interest in so doing. They are persuaded to take part in the ""Dum Lagao"" contest, where the husband carries his wife on his back through an obstacle course, in so doing they reconcile.The premise of this movie is fantastic, but it just doesn't deliver. There is very little character development, less happiness, and an ending that is too sudden and not credible. Khurrana, who is too old for the role, wears a scowl the entire movie and plays his part one- dimensionally. Pednekar, in her first movie, is fantastic, giving depth to Sandhya, portraying believable emotions, and acting nearly flawlessly. Her performance is so good that she nearly saves the movie, but not quite."
