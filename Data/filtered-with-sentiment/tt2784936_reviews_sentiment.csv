" Worth your time if you like mysterious plots that keep you in suspense till the end.
",0.5267,0.8442,2020-08-30 00:00:00,9,"This is one movie that's worth your time if you like mysterious plots that keep you in suspense till the end.But if you're one who just want an entertaining, chill-out weekend movie, then nope, this is not for you. This is more like a slow dark mystery movie that brings out the ""detective"" mind out of you."
" Very good
",0.4927,0.3142,2020-06-11 00:00:00,7,"This is a very underated film
I enjoyed it.
I think people expect every film to be blick buster.
But this is a lil gem."
" Well worth the watch.
",0.4588,0.887,2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"Adrien Brody is terrific in this, as is Sam Neill, of course. The rest of the cast is no less believable, though mostly unknown to me. It's a solid thriller/semi-horror. It builds slowly, never missteps and delivers an unexpected ending. Special kudos for the young woman playing the cop in the small town. I really also enjoyed the setting, and the score, which was never intrusive, but did everything a score should do :)"
" Spooky and enjoyable
",0.4404,0.8201,2020-04-12 00:00:00,8,Don't usually watch anything under an IMBD 6 rating but thankfully I did with Backtrack throughly enjoyable spooky tale üëçüëª
" An emotional psychological thriller that keeps you guessing
",0.25,0.9066,2020-04-10 00:00:00,8,"I'm picky, and am rarely impressed to any degree by the films I see. This is truly a great movie. The story continues to change up throughout, keeping you wondering from one scene to the next. It's got just enough scare factor, and the script and performances are stellar. There were a couple of things with the ending that didn't seem to fit, but that is easily forgiven. This is definitely worth seeing."
" Movie is worth the watch
",0.2263,-0.774,2020-03-04 00:00:00,5,"This is a slow burn and if you are not careful you may turn it off half way in. The movie appears to go one direction and changes just when you have figured it out.No real action, limited drama, really more of a psychological path down a person's selective memory of a a past trauma.Not a bad film, nothing to recommend to friends, okay to past the time without feeling like you lost time."
" Movie made for Brody to shine? He doesn't.
",0.0,0.6217,2020-02-20 00:00:00,5,"That doesn't mean this thriller or mystery movie is bad. There is a good movie between all the overused clich√©s (hallucinations, nightmares, flashback and visions) that can still be effective if well executed. Maybe some minor changes would've elevated the predictable, but good, story.The worst thing about the movie is that it feels way longer than it should (it's just a 90' movie). I think this is to make room for Brody to shine in more intimate and contemplative scenes. A bunch of scenes didn't have the dynamism to make them entertaining nor the originality to intrigue us even if they were slow. This could've been a moot point if Adrien would've infected the movie with charm or dramatic acting chops, but I just didn't see a particularly good performance from him in a, to be fair, already done a million times, character with posttraumatic stress disorder.It sounds worse than it actually is, a fine and entertaining enough short movie."
" Give me a break
",0.0,-0.7434,2019-05-04 00:00:00,1,Fatal flaw in this story. A bike could never derail a train. So stupid. The train would just mow it down............................
" Does Adrien Brody make any good movies?
",0.4404,-0.6705,2019-01-06 00:00:00,4,Or are they all crap. Because this was another weak effort. Tormented soul thy name is Brody. The script was garbage.
" Cool movie
",0.3182,0.7992,2018-12-27 00:00:00,6,Brody is excellent in this. The plot / storyline could have been better but the ambience was good.
" Well Made, But Derivative!
",0.2124,0.9736,2018-12-25 00:00:00,6,"Whilst in no way, taking ghost stories in a fresh direction, Backtrack is a well made and well acted Aussie feature, which is divided into two distinct halves.The first half is essentially extrapolated straight from The Sixth Sense/Ghost playbook.Adrien Brody (doing a very acceptable Australian accent) sees a lot of dead people whom he realises want some wrongs righted to bring balance to their supernatural existence. Brody is always extremely competent in these emotionally unbalanced and pressured roles. But I confess to wanting to see another less typical performance such as that in Predators, where I think he was surprisingly outstanding. But here he plays a psychiatrist similar to that of Bruce Willis in the aforementioned M.Night Shyamalan feature. Can I just add here, that I have never heard of psychiatrists operating without receptionists/practice managers in dark, dingy offices, rather than clinics, and where patients never seem to pay. Yes, we realise Peter's wife is emotionally scarred too, but why is she always seen in bed and apparently totally non - receptive to any of Peter's issues? Jenni Baird has to deal with a thankless task playing this pretty much redundant character.The second half shifts location to Peter's hometown of the ubiquitously named False Creek, as he seeks answers to the problems that ""assail"" both him and his ""patients"". As in Ghost, it becomes more of a supernatural whodunit without the laughs.Both George Shevtsov and Robin McLeavy notably stand out here as cops; the former, the ex-town cop and the latter, his contemporary equivalent.For a film with not a huge budget to play with, the CGI special effects are effectively used in bringing the ghosts ""to life"" (I couldn't resist the temptation) and the film to its climax with a couple of well-staged train smashes that are quite realistic.Backtrack generally avoids going down the cheap shock path, being more prepared to build an atmosphere of creepy unease. But ultimately, though entertaining in its generic way, it doesn't provide any memorable experiences, in the way the films do, from which it borrows so heavily."
" Nice Thriller for a saturday night!
",0.5411,0.895,2018-12-02 00:00:00,8,"The movie plays well from the very start, almost focused in the main character, and his ""pacients"". We were entertained from the beginning to the end of the movie.
Nice plot twist, suspense and some scarry scenes... A solid 8 out of 10."

" If you stick with it, it's well worth it.
",0.4588,0.9809,2018-10-24 00:00:00,7,"I'm one of those people that came close to switching it off, I found the first half of the film excruciatingly boring, I've never watched a horror thriller before and found myself nodding off, with this I did. Possibly because I didn't quite get what was going on with the story, it wasn't explained in any sort of way, which I found frustrating, but once you become involved as a viewer, which is just over half way through, the film becomes gripping, captivating, and thoroughly enjoyable.Very well acted, Adrien Brody is terrific, as is Sam Neill. Some terrific special effects, and good music, which doesn't overtake the film.Second watch, and I'll enjoy it all the more.The only scenario I can think of for this film, imagine being invited to a party where you don't know anyone, half way through you get to know the guests, have a drink, and engage. This film is the same."
" Don't miss
",0.1139,0.9209,2018-10-04 00:00:00,9,"Somehow I missed this when it was released, until I randomly saw it on Amazon today and gave it a watch. Which was lucky, as it's a film not to be missed.Shades of The Sixth Sense, shades of The Machinist, a brooding atmosphere, Hitchcockian twists and turns and a star performance from Adrian Brody. Just superb.It doesn't do anything massively original, but what it does... it does with an assured hand and it's totally engrossing. One of those slow burn films that grabs your attention and never lets go, with a pay off that delivers.I was shouting at the screen at the end, always a good sign. Unless you're watching it on the bus, obviously."
" Kept us off our phones!
",0.0,0.6468,2018-09-29 00:00:00,8,We really enjoyed this psychological ghost story. With creepy music and lots of 'jumpscares'. An interesting storyline that kept us guessing until the end!
" Expect the unexpected
",0.0,-0.433,2018-09-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie starts very slowly and with lots of doom and gloom, but stick with it and you will be rewarded with a great movie. This movie is hard to classify as it is in parts a phycological thriller, part drama and part horror. The horror is of the ""jump scare"" type, and it will catch you out a few times, but it doesn't need to be gory to prove it's point. The movie keeps you guessing throughout after an initial slow start and it builds the intrigue well and keeps you hooked to find out what is really going on. I thought Aiden Brody played his part of the stressed out grieving father extremely well and I really enjoyed this movie."
" Dark, Gloomy Atmosphere Sets The Tone Of This Film
",-0.1531,0.9717,2018-09-15 00:00:00,7,"While I enjoyed this, it seemed to drag out in parts. I found myself wanting to get to the answers more quickly but I understood it was meant to set up the ending. I have to take away some stars for being able to see what was coming. This did have the gloomy, dark tone and that, I loved. I also thought that Adrian Broody did a great job of being the focus of the film. The special effect were just ok for me. It's not bad. Check it out."

" Surprising but great movie.
",0.802,0.8454,2018-05-23 00:00:00,10,Made me think a little and wondering what was really going on but it became more clear towards the end and actually gave me chills when it was over. A very good movie.
" Haunted by the Past
",-0.4767,-0.5423,2018-05-13 00:00:00,7,"After losing his daughter hit by a truck, the troubled psychologist Peter Bower (Adrien Brody) moves to Sidney with his wife Carol (Jenni Baird) and his colleague and friend Dr. Duncan Stewart (Sam Neill) gets strange patients for him. When Dr. Bower discovers a secret about Dr. Stewart and his patients, he travels alone to his hometown False Creek to the house of his estranged father William Bower (George Shevtsov). Haunted by his past, Peter digs his recollections and uncovers a hideous secret from his past. ""Backtrack"" is an above average ghost story, with a good screenplay. The cast has great performance and the plot is intriguing, entwining family drama with horror and the conclusion is well resolved. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Vis√µes do Passado"" (""Visions from the Past"")"
" It doesn't feel okay
",-0.1695,-0.9554,2018-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Dr. Peter Bower (Adrien Brody) laments and blames himself over the death of his daughter Evie (Emma O'Farrell). He accepts a job in Sydney doing psychological assessment. He discovers his patients all have one thing in common, something which forces him to return home and remember an event from over 20 years ago.Adrien Brody appears to have been typed cast into roles of a gloomy individual. He plays a pathetic individual not knowing what is happening to him, someone who sees ghosts. The film never develops into a real horror in spite of a few attempts to have a scary ghost scene. It is described as a mystery/thriller with the thriller side being light and half of the mystery revealed in the film trailer. The mystery peels itself back like an onion skin, never giving us enough clues to go beyond the next level.While I enjoyed watching the film, it is not one I would watch again."
" Spoilers follow ...
",0.0,0.9446,2017-12-23 00:00:00,6,"A majestic rainstorm illuminates the city backdrop throughout much of this Australian supernatural horror. A downpour can add so much atmosphere and unease to scenes if handled effectively - and here, Director (and Writer) Michael Petroni uses it very well indeed.Sam Neill is an actor who has quietly built up a massive body of work. He is always solid, reliable and a powerful presence onscreen. Casually sophisticated and authoritative, he is typically fine here, playing Duncan Stewart, sceptical of the sinister possibilities that are unfolding. Neill's in good company - Adrien Brody is excellent as tortured Psychologist Peter Bower, who happens upon young Elizabeth, a patient who holds secrets of her own.This unleashes a whole series of sightings, glimpses, jump scares and apparitions. And yet the overall effect is more of a slowly unfolding mystery than a 'straightforward' horror (if there is such a thing), elevated by the performances from the universally excellent cast and rich production values. The film doesn't quite live up to the moody success of its early scenes, but it keeps things simmering nicely.The finale and climax either work or they don't, depending on your point of view. After such a carefully built-up - and occasionally ponderous - storyline, the last moments step up a couple of gears to provide what I thought was a pretty satisfying endgame, even if the 'twist' at the end is fairly routine."
" Great movie!
",0.6588,0.933,2017-12-03 00:00:00,8,"This was a really interesting 90 minutes. A few plot problems but it grabbed my attention right away trying to figure out what was going on.A little slow moving but fun, with a few scares and a lot of twists.I don't really understand the bad reviews, and people trying to figure out and disagree with the motives of ghosts.So, it's a mystery with a little bit of horror sprinkled in. I know some of the scares were old hat but I liked them anyway.I don't see why everyone is raving about the acting of Adrien Brody. It wasn't that great I think any decent actor could have pulled it off. Didn't matter, it was the story that was good. I did really love the small part of Sam Neil though! Who throws in one of the first interesting twists.Possible spoiler: everyone is comparing this to other movies, but the one I think it's most like is ""Stir of Echoes"" with Kevin Bacon.Overall: if you don't like slow movers, you might not like it, but I thought it was great. Just hang in there for a while it gets better and better until the very end."
" This One Will Take You Back
",0.0,0.9119,2017-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Consummate actor Adrien Brody treats us yet again to a brilliant performance as a troubled psychiatrist suffering from selective amnesia. Everything he plays in is 75% better because he's there--and that honor generally only goes to Johnny Depp and Anthony Hopkins. This ghost story has a few twists, and the CGI helps tell the story instead of overpowers it. The first part of the film is quite a bit better than the last 45 minutes, but I like ghost stories without additional detective work and sequences which include revenge--even if it is ghostly. To me, BACKTRACK Part 2 should be about the psychiatrist's father and how he plans to pay his victims back--or just explain it all to God--or maybe both. In this film I would have liked to see the old man break down and confess instead of getting chewed up by a passenger train. All in all, this one's worth your time if you like spooky stories. I could have done without the jump scares, though."
" Old School horror
",-0.5719,0.8691,2017-09-17 00:00:00,8,"This is a nice little horror film. It has elements of the Changeling (1980), a bit of Sixth Sense, a bit of Jacobs Ladder and even a bit of Flatliners, and a bit of a Beautiful Mind... without ever achieving the heights of any of these classic films. It is probably closest to the Changeling (1980) in style... a slow build up that combines mystery and classic ghost story.It makes great use of sound which is the essence of a good horror film. It is let down by the cheap jump scare tactics. It would've been a lot better had they left the horror makeup at home too. It was doing really well on the creepy front when it maintained the human appearance... but when it went into demonic mode it destroyed the best parts of the film.I've given it 8/10 because it is a good film and it does make excellent use of sound... can't stress enough the importance of sound in horror... it is much more important than the visual.Don't expect a slasher movie... those are not true horror... they're thrillers. For me horror needs to be subtle and contain an element of the supernatural, and it needs to make you feel uneasy long after the film. If it doesn't raise the hairs on the back of your arm at least once then it is rubbish. This film ticks the boxes for a decent horror and it is only let down by the cheap shots... and his father is not a very good actor."
" Got lost in the rain
",-0.3182,-0.992,2017-05-08 00:00:00,2,"Sorry, there are some (mild) spoilers here.The sad thing about this movie is that there was a decent story there, but instead of telling that, everyone focused on building up to a twist, and then overemphasized that part with dark rainy broody moody mumbled boo-o-o-o-ring haunting of a completely unlikable unsympathetic character. The one ghost (the daughter) that maybe should have haunted the protagonist was apparently on vacation. The other ghosts gathered at the office but I don't understand why, when there was a much more obvious and guilty person to haunt. Really, this film could have worked well without all the damn ghosts, that brought nothing to the table except for annoying sound effects and hackneyed movie 'scares' we've seen too many times. The reveal was rushed and downright silly. If ghosts had all that power, then why bother with the first part? And would the ghost of the mother killed in the train wreck really be willing to risk her daughter's life so another ghost can get revenge? I'd predict more infighting among the ghosts... now that could have been a movie! Although many people seem to like Brody's 'acting', it seemed cardboard to me. I could not connect to his supposed grief/guilt, or that he had any relationship with his sleeping wife, or that he had lost a child. None of that resonated. Also, and I realize that it is a trend now, but what is with the 5 minutes plus of credits?"
" Unexpected.
",0.0,0.6939,2017-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Very pleasantly surprised. Adrien Brody just delivers a genuinely believable performance. This thriller mystery is not to be mistaken as a horror but that doesn't mean there are no jumpy scenes ! which I might add are perfectly timed to give the goose bumps. Decent directing unveiling the plot at a steady pace to stay mysterious yet kept the mind ticking. No spoilers just watch it, you will be entertained. RG"
" At last an atmospheric Australian Ghost Story
",-0.3182,0.9578,2017-03-26 00:00:00,8,"At last an Australian Ghost story with a lot of atmosphere and an excellent cast. I must admit Academy Award winner Adrien Brody nailed his attempt at the Australian accent. Casting Adrien Brody, Sam Neill and Robin McLeavy should help international appeal and marketing.A ghost story about a grieving psychologist in Melbourne, Australia who is haunted by ghostly apparitions which make him search out his past in his rural home town.Excellent support cast includes Sam Neill, Robin McLeavy (The Loved Ones 2011), George Shevtsov, Jenni Baird, Chloe Bayliss, Bruce Spence (Mad Mad 2,3, Matrix Revolutions, Lord of the Rings) and Malcolm Kennard (Catching Milat). Great locations in Melbourne, Sydney, Carcoar and Oberon in country New South Wales.Robin McLeavy plays the role of a local rural cop with a sweet yet authoritative manner. Pure genius casting actor George Shevtsov as Adrien Brody's retired cop dad.Love the moody, atmospheric sets, photography and realistic special effects.I had never heard of the film and was lucky to pick it up by chance at my local public library. This is my first IMDb review in years. Sad to see the forums go."
" Effortless excellence from a hardworking brilliant crew.
",0.836,0.8834,2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"A thriller quite different from Sixth Sense. Backtrack develops the conceptual plot that was initially introduced. Comparing the two films enables to audience to consider the genre and alerts them to the further establishment of the genre. Suspense and mysteries unfold establishing divine justice paralleled to that of Peter, the main character. He is the vehicle through which the story is told, values are expounded and his character revealed when he is forced to make split second judgments. Living in a small world of significant relationships he learns to consider his future in terms of eternity. Giving the audience one possible framework."
