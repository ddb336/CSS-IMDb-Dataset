" Over 700 Reviews This Gets My Highest Recommendation To Date!
",0.0,0.9922,2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,"Why?
I'm glad you asked.This is a fun, exciting movie with great action, humour and hijinks. Its comparable to any Guy Ritchie film of a similar style.Why am I recommending this film so highly...it needs it and it deserves it. You have all heard of Avengers or Borat or Tenet but how many of you had heard of Redirected? You may not enjoy it as much as I did (I hope you do) but you will enjoy it. Its much better than it looks and is much better than the cast would lead you to believe.It may be the best movie to come out of Lithuania (and the UK)...I don't know because I'm not sure if I've seen another Lithuanian movie!!Doesn't rely on Vinnie Jones to carry the movie, he is a great part of it.A super pleasant surprise :)"
" Lock, Stock, but no smoking barrels
",-0.4215,0.2185,2020-08-16 00:00:00,5,"Shows Lithuania and Lithuanians in a poor light. Lots of action and profanity on a limited budget. Probably Vinnie's paycheck cost as much as the rest of the movie. Acting was good, story was good. Amusing film, but you won't want to watch it twice...."
" Poor Guy Richie take off.
",-0.4767,-0.3818,2020-07-27 00:00:00,3,This director is no Guy Richie. Surprised Vinnie Jones bothered with this.
" Well...
",0.0,0.48,2020-04-26 00:00:00,5,"It was not the best, yet not the worst movie I have ever seen...but as I always say...it was still more entertaining and had more suspense than midsommar..."
" Very entertaining, but not good for a rewatch
",-0.2529,-0.05,2019-11-01 00:00:00,6,"This movie was very similar to The Hangover. Both movies rely on shock value of wondering what comes next. Unfortunately, once you've seen it once, there is no shock value if you watch it again. So in the end, both movies are very fun for a single watch, and I'm really glad that I watched them, but neither one is worth watching a second time.The major difference between the two movies is The Hangover shocks you with a mystery as you unravel what has already happened, while Redirected shocks you by making you repeatedly think, ""At least the situation can't get any worse than this,"" and then showing you that it can, in fact, get much worse."
" An UNGODLY amount of fake 10/10 reviews on this movie
",-0.4767,-0.8519,2019-09-22 00:00:00,6,"It's either bots or just a mass-campaign by the movie studio, but there's an absolute craptonne of fake 10/10 reviews on this movie... a total of 35%+ of the reviews on this movie are 10/10 and 90% of those reviews are done by bots/fake profiles. IMDB should have done something about bots YEARS ago, I mean this is 2019 and we're still having the scores of movies on this site influenced GREATLY by bots (without those 35%+ of fake reviews, the movie would be an averaged 4.6 rating, instead of the current 6.6)"
" He took the ring to Mordor.
",0.0,0.9081,2019-03-17 00:00:00,6,"Redirected is a funny film, though not of a high quality.Every character's up to no good, so there's no one to help. It continues on and on, spiraling out of control. The best moment's when two of the four are on the phone with each other and they're in desperate need of the others help and saying yes even though they're in the same sort of predicament."
" GIVE ME BACK THE RING
",0.0,0.8818,2018-09-11 00:00:00,6,"Michael (Scot Williams) is looking forward to celebrating his birthday with his girlfriend Jessica. However he is highjacked by some mates and they use him as a driver as they knock over Vinnie Jones with specific directions to take his ring. Vinnie of course figures out where they go (Lithuania) and a pursuit follows.The film is a combination grindhouse and comedy. Unfortunately the film's comedy is more akin to 60's Italian comedy than smart British wit . For instance in one scene a nude man is chained to a radiator, which he liberates and carries around for half the film. The film seemed misdirected at times. Much of the film has English subtitles with jokes aimed at a Lithuanian audience. Scot Williams was not convincing in his role and he was the only character they developed.Guide: F-bomb, sex, and nudity"
" Some bad reviews but I enjoyed it.
",0.4939,0.9304,2017-09-01 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this one, it was a mix of lock stock with The hangover, it was predictable but after 10000 movies they are all predictable. not a Vinnie Jones fan but he works well in movies like this, nice Tony Montana reference thrown in their. It could have been written better so not a 10er"
" Not Great...
",0.0,-0.5379,2017-07-25 00:00:00,3,"I mean 6.7 on IMDb doesn't mean a good movie anymore. Boring, missed a few of the scenes because i was just day dreaming throughout. The acting was average, the plot was not engaging and very predictable. I guess the premise had potential but it was just poorly executed. I guess there are a lot more paid reviewers than I first thought."
" Funny, in a pantomime-like kind of way
",0.4404,0.9637,2017-05-27 00:00:00,7,"This is a violent movie, true, with plenty of four-letter expletives, but the violence is a little bit cartoon-like really. If you can forgive that, then the movie is worth watching for the humour, because it is very funny in places. Vinny Jones is his normal menacing self. Jolly good fun."
" Rated high by Lithuanians only
",0.0,0.9782,2017-02-25 00:00:00,2,"Anyone who is not from Lithuania or have seen a single decent Hollywood movie will hate this movie right from the beginning.You see, this movie was produced by Lithuanians. To Lithuanian standards this movie is good but to the rest of the world this is a low quality Tier 2 TV film at best. There is a good reason for that. The plot is a copycat of famous comedy crime movies such as Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or RocknRolla. Ant it's implemented very very poorly. The story line is so predictable and editing is so wannabe Quentin Tarantino/ Guy Richie that you will turn it off before it reaches it's first 30 minutes I guarantee. Any 5/10 IMDb rated Hollywood movie is 10x better and more interesting than this Lithuanian movie.If you are not a Lithuanian please watch the movie. I hope you give it a rating that it truly deserves and maybe then the director will give a second thought to his work. He will thank you later."
