",-0.6249,-0.6709,2021-01-08 00:00:00,1,"I don't understand some of the positive reviews trying to defend this movie, it was absolutely horrible. The only decent thing in the film was probably Naomi Watts' performance and acting. Otherwise, the story is boring, nonsensical, and poorly written. Anybody who says it's not that bad have really low standards. This movie was awful, incoherent garbage with one of the worst plots I ever witnessed. Nothing in this film works. Please skip it, don't waste your time."

A young deaf boy who she is working with disappears, presumed dead in the winter storm, seems to be haunting her house, or is she losing her mind? This is how the movie somewhat plods along. However there is a major and ridiculous plot turn - her disabled stepson had been pretending to be in a vegetative state for 6 months and now he's gone all mad, the film turning from possible supernatural to predictable slasher. For me this was too much to swallow, shame as I had been rather enjoying it up until the. The acting is OK, I liked the rural New England, snow covered setting plus there is some suspense, though it is not very scary.
Shut In is a reasonable 90 minutes but for me it's an easily forgettable, one time watch."

" Family Noir ?
",0.0,-0.905,2020-04-26 00:00:00,2,"I don't think that this deserves to be called thriller, drama. Rather horror, or better shocker. Later partially because those loud sound effects (music ?) when something 'suspense' happens.
Whole story self is shock in some way: child psychologist has psychopath son. That self - how he became it would be much more interesting than what we seen here - mindless violence + some really unrealistic behavior, actions.I feel sorry for great actress Naomi Watts - how she went in this drivel ? Absolutely worst movie she participated. Yeah, worse even than that Children of Corn X (don't remember part #) . At least it was what promised - cheap horror.
Someone had too much money, and too little sense for quality ?I barely finished this. Just wanted to see end, and as much sad it was, that was only moment I was happy with. Rating 2 only because acting."

This was a very enjoyable film, very well produced and in terms of acting, very well all round, and the production and cinematography were spot on. Very good throughout, loved the premise of staying away from the paranormal, and worked in favour.As with all movies some will like it, some won't, and this is just my opinion..."
" Veers between tedious and laughable
",0.0516,-0.5859,2020-03-24 00:00:00,3,"SHUT IN is a low budget Canadian thriller with a Hollywood star in the form of Naomi Watts, who really needs to learn to pick better material (but then I wasn't fussed about the bloated KING KONG remake that made her name either). She plays the stepmother of a boy (as played by STRANGER THINGS star Charlie Heaton) badly disabled in a car accident that also killed her husband. The two share many dark times but there's a ray of light when another vulnerable boy comes into Naomi's care. All this is rather insipid and tired, and then towards the end it suddenly shifts into a laughably predictable psycho thriller mode with jump scares and the like. It's not believable for a moment."

",0.0,-0.4779,2019-11-06 00:00:00,4,"There have been many movies like Shut In before. In fact, I'd argue far too many.Grisly opening, followed by a quieter first act, then a few hints at something something spooky, then comes THE TWIST.After we've finished picking our jaws from the floor (yeah right), the movie then concludes in one of those pointlessly elongated chase sequences which would be over much sooner if anyone here had any common sense whatsoever.A disabled kid's life is in danger, the bad guy hams it up like his life depended on it, and Naomi Watts...Poor lamb. She deserves much better than this reheated tripe, that's for sure.But she signed the contract, cashed the cheque and turned up on time to each days shoot... so my sympathy can only go so far.Oh well.

" Watts Naomi doing in this dull thriller?
",-0.4069,0.9883,2019-10-16 00:00:00,4,"""Shut In"" is a very mundane, predictable and derivative thriller, so the only noteworthy thing to wonder is why a classy and multi-talented actress like Naomi Watts agreed to star in it. She appeared in horror movies/thrillers before - like ""The Ring"" or the remake of ""Funny Games"" - but that was quite a long time ago. The times and the competition must be rough in Hollywood these days, I guess. Sure, ""Shut In"" remains a watchable and competently made little film, but it isn't the least bit memorable and you honestly have to be pretty naïve NOT to see the principal plot-twist coming. From quite early in the film already, in fact. Watts is a great actress, and if there still are a few atmospheric and intense moments to enjoy, it's undeniably thanks to her performance. She just deserves better than to depict a so-called ""damsel-in-distress""."
" Ummm...
",0.0,-0.8012,2019-08-11 00:00:00,3,"For me its a really bad, during all the time i didnt see anything, because it was dark, then it was soooo predictable for thriller movie.

It's a thriller movie! What did you expect?I'd love to see Naomi Watts more in movies like this :)"
" There is nothing of redeeming value about this film.
",-0.2584,0.5994,2019-04-16 00:00:00,3,"Not even Naomi Watts can save ""Shut In"", a cheaply filmed and lazily generic excuse for a thriller that should be shut out of your viewing."
" Shut ... what?
",0.0,0.8659,2019-04-01 00:00:00,5,"Now let's start with something positive. I actually think that the movie is able to create a mood, a sense of distraught ... almost throughout the whole movie. If the tension created is something you really appreciate, you may feel that this movie should have a higher rating.On the other hand, if you are annoyed by the main character (and others) and their behaviour, all the mood in the world will not convince you to like the movie or even enjoy it. Overall it is a decent effort and there are some nice scares (if you'll allow me to describe it that way). Naomi Watts really does her best and she carries the movie. The script/movie may think it is way more clever than it actually is - but if you don't mind that, you have something to look forward to"
" JUST OKAY - (5 stars out of 10)
",0.3885,0.881,2019-03-18 00:00:00,5,"The stage curtains open ...""Shut In"" is one of those movies where the idea of the movie is better than the movie itself. As I settled in, my interest was peaked with some great suspense, cinematography and genuinely creepy moments. However, it fails to deliver in the end.The story starts out with a family splitting up for a while due to problems within the home. The father and his teenage son get into a bad argument while on the road, and as a result are involved in a fatal car accident which kills the father and puts the son in an unresponsive state, requiring the attention to his every need by his stepmother. As a child psychologist, she does her best to help her son as well as other client's children while coping with the fact that she might need to send her son away for better care - care that she is feeling too taxed to provide. In the meantime, one little boy she is helping runs away and ends up in her house leading to disastrous results and things she could've never foreseen.I had high hopes for this one as I liked the premise and I felt the first hour of the movie was very well made. The camera work was really well done with great use of shadows which was effective in building the paranoia and the unsettled feeling of not knowing what is happening around you ... the effects of 'things that go bump in the night'. But then, the final act kicked in and the whole project went downhill fast.In the end, I felt disappointed in what I felt could have been something so much better than the payoff we waited to see. To be honest, I did guess what was happening ... but how I imagined it in my own mind was far more terrifying than the rather generic way it was handled.This is not a recommend. I have seen a lot worse, so I feel justified in giving it an average 5-star rating - because that's what this is. Just an average film of a promise of something that it never really delivers."
" So bad
",-0.5849,-0.8368,2019-03-10 00:00:00,2,How do movies like this get made? So so bad. There's a potentially good plot twist here that just gets wasted in the inanity. Good actors but so many plot holes and stupidity in the characters. Ugh.

Not a movie I will rewatch over and over again, no instant classic, but I enjoyed it. Like another reviewer put it: everything below 5 or 6 stars isn't justified in my opinion, given you are generally into that genre. If that's not your genre you will obviously not like it."
" Good but one big flaw

" Wasted opportunity

This plot has huge holes. How does a kid pretend to be in a catatonic state for 6 months without anybody noticing? Does he not have physical therapists or doctors come by? Ridiculous."
" Nonsense...but somehow interesting
",0.4019,0.9011,2018-04-27 00:00:00,6,"Well,let me tell you this film is watchable.Although there are many,many nonsense scenes (why does Naomi insist in going outside in the freezing porch and calling the boy by his name IF HE IS....DEAF ??? ) That's an incredible GOOF nobody has noticed yet but it is really nonsense.On the other side I didn't predict the final twist even I have seen many movies during my 56 years ...Well,I give a 6 / 10 because it was somehow interesting but absolutely annoying in some scenes.Regards from Argentina.

" no heart pounder
",-0.296,-0.9535,2017-12-17 00:00:00,4,"Steven Portman (Charlie Heaton) is an angry teen and causes his father to drive into a truck. Six months later, Steven is in a vegetative state and his father is dead. His stepmother Mary (Naomi Watts) is struggling to care for him. She's a child psychologist. Tom Patterson (Jacob Tremblay) is a deaf patient who goes missing.The story telling is muddled but worst than that, it's lackluster. It tries to be a little bit of Shinning with the snowy isolation. There are too many ""It's a Nightmare"" reveals. A great actor like Oliver Platt gets only fleeting appearances. I actually thought Tremblay would have more screen time. Overall, this movie does a lot of nothing scenes that hopes to build the mood but really does nothing at all. None of it is scary. There is an obvious twist that I fear would happen. Sure enough, it does and it's as lame as that."
" This was a painful, slow watch. I felt like I was shut in.
",-0.1027,-0.9964,2017-11-12 00:00:00,1,"This film is terrible. There's nothing more I can say about that. It is sad that there is a considerable amount of talent infront of the camera, specifically from Naomi Watts and Charlie Heaton, and also a fanatastic cinematographer that at least managed to shine this turd as much as they can, but so much of this film was agonising.The main issues with this film can be chalked up to two things: repetitive and dumb writing, and a constant disconnect between audience and story. The same things repeat over and over in this movie:There are SO FRICKING MANY dream sequences, specifically in the first 30 minutes that it grew tired, and resulted in a lot of fake scares that add nothing to the story. The conversations between Naomi Watts and Oliver Platt are the same every time: ""I'm having issues sleeping"", ""Well, you're under a lot of a stress"", ""Yeah I am, I thinking of sending Stephen away"", ""Well, that would be understandable"", times 5 again. Conversations between characters reveal nothing new, and is filled with dialogue that play like Tommy Wiseau's The Room in that they are catchphrases, and offer only stilted interactions. The finale is the worst - the actual worst. The bad guy gets hit in the head SO...MANY...TIMES, and every time, they pretend like he's dead and not finish him off, while Naomi Watts leaves the kid played by Jacob Tremblay alone twice and you're all like ""Why ARE you leaving him there?!""The screenplay sadly does waste an excellent cinematographer on repetitive dialogue, uninspired set-pieces that remind me too much of The Shining albeit worse and with way less snow (seriously, why do people act like they're cut off with snow about 6 inches deep?) and a twist SO dumb it begs belief. It's when this twist is revealed that people who may have cared by this point will walk out. Embarrassing.So, this twist has to be told to be believed. The plot of the movie is that Naomi Watts plays Mary, a child therapist, and is looking after her stepson Stephen played by Stranger Things' Charlie Heaton after he was paralysed in a car crash that killed her husband. While treating Tom, played by Jacob Tremblay, he goes missing and she starts to have weird night terrors. It's revealed about halfway into this mess that Stephen isn't actually paralysed - he's just pretending to be. Furthermore, it's stated that the doctor's at the hospital just accepted it and didn't ask why. Then, when Mary starts treating Tom, he gets jealous and locks Tom in the basement of the house, and the night terrors are a result of Mary being continuously drugged every day with Stephen's meds.Admittedly, it is quite cool in this part of the movie to watch Charlie Heaton who is so quiet and nuanced on Stranger Things just go completely nuts here and just have fun, but it still doesn't help how certain characters are killed off inconsequently, or in the case of Oliver Platt, is fatally stabbed only to survive an additional 10 minutes to give basic as f**k instructions so Mary and Tom can live.Oddly enough, even though this is a terrible film, it is a great first watch just to say you sat down and watched it, and laugh at its dumbass progression. Like I said, great cinematography, fun from Watts and Heaton, everything else is the worst."
" Fatally flawed, autistic horror
",-0.836,-0.985,2017-11-09 00:00:00,4,"Poor Naomi Watts. She did and gave everything she could to this movie, but it still came out a steaming turd. This genuinely wants to be a good, tight horror movie that delivers the scares, but its all just so lame and fake, it falls flat on its face and can't be redeemed. What little suspense it does have is ruined by horribly attempted jump scares. This is one movie that should have stayed shut in someones imagination."
" The only real shock in this supposed horror flick is how preposterously incompetent it is
",-0.8555,-0.9709,2017-10-21 00:00:00,1,"Shut In is a solid presentation of the horror genre at it worst. Completely devoid of scares and lacking in logical taste, this film, directed by Farren Blackburn, leaves two-time Oscar nominee Naomi Watts dwindling in an exercise of severely ineffective storytelling and lack of effective thrills perpetrated by a script that feels so empty, it is almost difficult to believe this is intended to be a horror movie. It is an hour and a half of Watts wandering seemingly aimlessly around in dark corners of the house while the atmosphere grows intoxicated to an eerie music score that builds up virtually nothing. And the whole ideal grows exhausting to the point where the film has nothing to offer but mindless tedium. The biggest surprise the film has to offer is the big twist at the end, and let's be clear, to say it is a bad twist is way too generous of a word to describe to. It makes wander what Watts was thinking when she signed up to submit herself to this other than to earn herself a paycheck. This film follows child psychologist Mary (played by Naomi Watts) who is left to take care of her 18-year old son Stephen (played by Charlie Heaton) who has been crippled from a car accident that killed his stepfather. While caught in a violent snowstorm, one of her young patients Tommy (played by Jacob Tremblay), a deaf boy, mysteriously goes missing, she must do everything she can do to find him. The best way to sum up this snoozer of a movie is a child abduction thriller with infrequent cheap jump scares and loud eerie music blowing up the audio while the lead character puts poor effort into finding a little boy who is lost and stranded somewhere out in the freezing cold. Are there any ghosts? Nope. Are there a murderous psychopath in a mask wielding a knife? Absolutely not. As clichéd and washed up those horror villains are, placing them one of them as the antagonist would almost make the story a little more competent than it is. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. Instead, this film banks almost entirely not on a creepy music score to intensify the atmosphere and assigns Naomi Watts with the task of creeping around the house at the night because that apparently is supposed to equate for effective scares. And every once a while, something unsettling will occur only for Watts to wake up gasping and reveal it is just a silly little dream sequence. Each of the events that transpire to amount to virtually nothing until the climax when the story hits us with a twist that is, to say the least, beyond ludicrous. Meanwhile, Watts is doing her best to sustain in the lead while Charlie Heaton, fresh from his supporting role in the Netflix series 'Stranger Things' remains stoic to portray a crippled young man who's robbed of his ability to walk and feed himself without the assistance of his mother. Then there is Jacob Tremblay, the young star from 'Room' is given no dialogue due to his character being deaf. But the biggest mystery here is what motivated each of these talented actors to commit to such a head-banging excuse of a film like this. Shut In is a movie devoid of everything representing a good competent horror flick and leaves its audiences trudging through an hour-and- half soul-sucking tedium, that is if they are even willing to its entirety. It is a dull representation of the horror genre that was probably best being left on the shelf."
" Dull and Annoying
",-0.6597,-0.2732,2017-10-02 00:00:00,4,"This is one of those movies that initially messes with the viewer so much that you end up losing the will to invest.Cheap jump scares, visions and apparent dream sequences all thrown at you just makes for uninteresting viewing, there is very little by way of real substance.Just over half way through, the plot twist (which is obvious) reveals itself, and therefore the movie is subsequently typical cat and mouse shenanigans.Zzzzz"
" The first film generated by a bot?
",0.0,-0.9839,2017-09-23 00:00:00,1,"Dear God, this is dreadful, I've seen some boring horror films, some clichéd ones, and some illogical ones, but this really takes the biscuit. Really, where to begin? The atrocious dialogue that feels like it's been cobbled together after a first-year Psychology lesson? The cardboard characters who hold meaningless conversations that serve no purpose other than to take up time, the plot twist that is so preposterous it's not even funny, it's just stuff that creates a film that people will watch for money?Even at a barely film length of 87 minutes it still felt way too long. Aside from the dialogue between people who can only be described as characters because they're actors mouthing (terrible) lines in a film, at least half of the first act is meaningless jump 'scares' where nothing actually happens.If the first half's dreadful, it's still Silence of the Lambs compared to what can, charitably, be described as the denouement. Following a plot twist that can't really be described as such - it's just something that happens to turn a collection of words and pictures into a film - any remaining viewers are forced to sit through an interminable finale where every possible film cliché is thrown at you until it just becomes white noise, and an ending so ill-conceived, you wonder if the writer has ever interacted with another (or just a) human being. It's like Scream and all the other self-referential horror films never happened. It could have been made 30 years ago and it would still be as stale and unmemorable. I only bought it because it had two credible actors in Naomi Watts and Oliver Platt (why though?!?) and was on sale at Asda for £2.99 - and even then I feel robbed.I can't even say this is one of the worst films ever, it's just nothing, and even now it's beginning to fade from memory."
" Sad.
",-0.4767,0.7956,2017-09-21 00:00:00,3,"It's a shame, really. First, Naomi Watts is no longer the radiant golden girl of ten or so years ago. Age has reduced her to the status of a mere beautiful woman whom any normal man would love to smother in hot kisses.That's unimportant. What's really worrisome is that she's playing in dud like ""Shut Ins."" She is a widower living in a house in rural Maine, making a living as a counselor in the distant town, spending all of her time at home tending her brain damaged and vegetablized teen-aged son, changing his diapers, spoon feeding him, wheeling his apparently senseless body around.But one of those big Northeastern snow storms is about to blow in, likely cutting off all power and buying everything. She stacks up on comestibles and lanterns and is visited by a genuinely nice guy, single, whom she's met at the clinic, and whose son is also challenged. He's so sociable and helpful that she feels compelled to invite him to dinner. Clearly he's interested but she's polite and distant.The snow has barely begun, or maybe it's already stopped, and she's having nightmarish fantasies, or maybe they were dreams, of her son moving around the house deftly on his own, and then -- and then -- she wakes up to find herself tied naked in the bathtub by her now thoroughly mobile but maniacal boy and she forces her to take sleeping pills and then, and then, she struggles to free herself of her binding lines and then, and then, she swallows a bottle of SHAMPOO to bring up the gag reflex and rid her nude body of those wicked pills, and then -- and then -- well, I just couldn't go on.No, the tension was too great. My heart raced alarmingly as I waited for the next cliché -- the hand reaching in from offscreen, the cat shattering the Mason jar, the mysterious creaking of an opening door, the need to creep down the stairs into the dark basement, the WHAM on the sound track with each new shock.No. It was all too much. I can't remember if I shut it off before I fell asleep."

If the film is free on TV you may want to use it as background noise for 91 minutes while texting friends or gaming, but otherwise this is a 'pass'. The film opens in New England with Mary (Naomi Watts), a child psychologist working from home, bidding farewell to her 18-year-old stepson Stephen (Charlie Heaton). His father, Richard (Peter Outerbridge), is taking him to a special school for the summer. Stephen is very angry. On the way, he and his father get into an argument and Richard reminds him that he wasn't the one who got expelled. The car goes out of control and skids into the path of an oncoming truck, killing Richard and leaving Stephen paralyzed from the neck down. Some time later we find Mary, widowed, left to care for Stephen's every need. Caught in a deadly winter storm, she must find a way to rescue a young boy Tom before he disappears forever. And this opens the door to 'ghosts' Mary suffers – only to discover the truth about Stephen and Tom through the inept advice of her psychologist friend Dr. Wilson (Oliver Platt). These fragments (and plenty of other non- contributory ones) are tossed together and out comes a silly attempt at a horror film that even quality actors like Watts and Platt cannot salvage. Pass."
" Refreshingly different horror film
",-0.5719,0.8176,2017-09-03 00:00:00,9,"This film definitely does not deserve all the hate. It was a good solid thriller, the acting was good, and so was the cinematography. Although there was some slight homage to the Shining, it was far from being predictable or derivative, and it kept the viewer guessing until close to the end. Perhaps to help out the less- informed viewer, one of the characters should have explained the ""shut-in syndrome"" at the outset, knowledge of which might have added to the intrigue for some of those panning this well-made indie movie."
" Cringeworthy, But Not For What You Think

That wouldn't be so bad; but there is the possibility of a dead boy haunting Watts. A boy whom she was treating for anger issues; a boy who may blame Watts for being sent away; a boy who may not have died. As the storm approaches, Watts' supernatural experiences become more terrifying (to the character, not so much to the audience). Is she being tormented by the boy's angry spirit, or is the boy still alive? Or is Watts' guilt over how she handled the boy's case and how she treated Heaton prior to his accident finally overwhelmed her mind, causing her to lose her sanity a little at a time?My most memorable, movie moment is the scene when Watts' friend sees through the computer camera something that reveals what is really going on.""Shut In"" gets a low grade because the main character makes one stupid decision after another throughout most of the movie. An example: she wants to get out of the house, but the doors and windows are nailed shut. The windows are flimsy, so what would you do? For Watts, instead of breaking a window, she panics and runs around and decides to break a skylight. If she's not concerned with making all kinds of noise by breaking a skylight, why not just break one of the ground floor windows and get out in less than five seconds?""Shut In"" would have received a much, much lower grade had it not been for the twist in the third act. I have to admit, the movie suckered me into thinking one way, and I was pleasantly surprised to find my thinking was erroneous.My last criticisms of this movie are these: there were too many similarities to ""The Shining"" during the third act — if you watch this movie and have seen ""The Shining,"" you'll see; and the creepiness factor of the bathroom scene (you'll know which one) is so high it'll make every woman cringe, unless you're really, really kinky.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

Long time actor Oliver Platt has a small role as a doctor.Watts did her normally great Oscar style performance for a film nobody is going to see. Unfortunately the plot was lame and formula. A second issue is that half the movie is filmed at night in candle light or filtered moonlight. You literally miss seeing scenes and have to figure out what is happening from the sound. Where is Tom Bodett when you need him? Guide: F-word. No sex. IMDb claims nudity, but it was dark and from the side."

We learn towards the end that he is not really disabled, it was all a ruse although I don't see how he could fake it for six months after expert medical examination.

It becomes so cliché and because of that I lost interest. Otherwise, it is could have been a decent one with all the good actors. Also the location was good, a perfect setting for the storyline. But not noticeable when the narration enters the second half, mainly because of thriller takes over.It is the story of a psychologist who recently lost her husband in a car crash, but ended up taking care of step-son after he became mentally and physically incapable. When the life was in the routine, suddenly something bad happens where her young patient goes missing. Following the event, she begins to experience what others won't believe her. But what comes later is more shocker, a twist in the tale takes us the conclusion.As the title and its genre suggest, it remained truth to that, but there is no innovation in storytelling. Most of the people would easily predict most of the parts if not the entire film. The casting was the advantage and they all were good, including the kid from 'Room' and Naomi. Even though it is rated very low everywhere, as well as by me, kind of entertaining, which means watchable till the end than cut it out in the middle. Not a film to recommend, but if you choose it to watch, I won't say don't.4/10"

" Shut In, really does shut you in to complete boredom
",-0.3182,-0.3764,2017-04-07 00:00:00,3,"Shut In is a psychological thriller that waste good talent like Naomi Watts that not only lacks thrills and scares. But it does not even have a compelling plot to even care for. Sure, there could be other home invasion thriller films that would be worth watching unlike this film. The plot follows psychologist Mary (Naomi Watts) after her marriage is struggling and her husband and her teenage son Steven (Charlie Heston) were going away. They were caught in a tragic car accident leaving Steven in a vegetated state. Mary is struggling trying to manage with her work and taking care of her son, and to make matters worse a snow storm is keeping them isolated in their home. When one of Mary's patient who is a kid Tom (Jacob Tremblay) goes missing in her area. Mary starts encountering strange noise in her house, feeling like someone is trying to stalk her. The script lacked characterization or development to the story which made it difficult to even care for what is happening. It does feel like the script writer took some ideas off from other thriller films like The Shining or Psycho. Let's throw some curve ball of having Mary struggle with insomnia and paranoia. The twist was not as appealing when it happened in the last half of the movie. Yes, the film started getting a little exciting when the climax is shown. But it's not worth spending the entire movie seeing Mary, managing her personal life and working with her patient Tom.The film lacked thrills and scares. It was a yawn fest waiting for anything to happen in the movie. Naomi Watts is a talented actress and this film seemed a little beneath her. But was probably an easy cash grab to be part of the project. Overall, Shut In was a horrible film, it lacked scares or thrills, dull concept that other films done it better, and the plot was undeveloped that seemed pointless."

She did a phenomenal job portraying someone who thinks they are going crazy, as well as someone who feels guilty about not being able to care for her step-son anymore.There was a couple of jump scares and the basement scenes that helped to drive up the tension. There was a bit more of a horror aspect towards the end of the movie, which was done well. And I did like that most of the movie was light enough that you could actually see what was going on.Now as for what I didn't like about it, as well as what I think would have been a better ending (courtesy of my step-dad's imagination).Spoilers Ahead.Major Spoilers Ahead, so stop reading if you don't want to know what happens.As soon as the little boy got lost, I immediately called that he was alive and living in her walls. The part that I couldn't figure out was why. I figured he had a good relationship with Mary that he would have came right to her instead of hiding. Then as soon as she started tripping and having weird dreams, I knew her stepson was able to move around and drug her. This may not have been as apparent to a lot of people, so I can let that slide. And it also explains why Tom hides in the walls, because Stephen doesn't want him there and is trying to find him quietly so Mary doesn't know he can walk around.The part that really got me was how all of a sudden (at least to the audience), Stephen was obsessed with Mary. They could have somehow showed it earlier before the accident, and I think that would have increased the creep factor.How it should have ended would be having Stephen kill everyone, and then get back into bed and continue to act like he was still paralyzed. It would have given it a Primal Fear vibe, which would have been awesome."

It was only in my city theater for ten days so I had to pay Amazon Prime $4.99 to see it, money wasted. The story was decent, just the actual follow through fell flat.

The film costars Charlie Heaton (of 'STRANGER THINGS' fame), Jacob Tremblay (of 'ROOM' fame) and Oliver Platt. It was directed by Farren Blackburn, and it was written by Christina Hodson. The movie received almost unanimous negative reviews from critics, and it bombed at the Box Office as well. I found it to be severely unimpressive too.Mary Portman (Watts) is a psychologist that recently lost her husband (Peter Outerbridge) in a horrible car accident. She now has to take care of their teenage son (Heaton) alone; who's also now in a seemingly permanent vegetative state, because of the accident. The two stay pretty isolated, in their secluded home, but Mary keeps in contact with her doctor (Platt), and other patients. When one of her young patients (Tremblay) goes missing, Mary also begins to suspect someone else is in their home. She desperately tries to find out who, or what, it is.I love horror movies and I also love Naomi Watts (she's been one of my favorite actresses for decades), so this film seemed really attractive to me. I also think the premise is a good idea for a psychological thriller as well, and the twist at the end is pretty good. The movie is mostly a bore though; it's poorly directed and it's also mostly poorly written. Watts is of course still good in the lead though, but she deserves much better material than this to work with!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Y0XE5jyxMFQ"
" Shockingly bad
",-0.6369,-0.9873,2017-03-14 00:00:00,3,"One of the things I hate most in horror movies is a PG-13 rating. It's like what's the point? We're making a film with the intention to scare you - but we're going to handicap our self in the process of doing it and likely fail for this reason. 'Shut In' has a PG-13 rating, but it is so bad that I don't think it could have gotten an R rating if it tried. This movie was unbelievably bland. Nearing the halfway point, nothing has happened. If you didn't know it was a horror movie going in, you'd still have no idea. There are jump scares here and there, yet none of them make any sense or give hints towards the story the film is trying to tell. Then there are the multiple dream sequences. The film makes an attempt to explain these later on, but by then what is the point? We already hate the fact that we have been mislead by them. The structuring of this movie was an absolute disaster.Then there's the twist. I had no idea going into the film that there would be a twist. Usually I love a twist more than anything else in a movie. Even if it's not the best, I still appreciate them making the effort. Not so in 'Shut In' though. This is quite possibly the worst twist I have ever seen in a movie. It is the most absurd thing you could possibly imagine. Giving the plausibility of it even the slightest thought will do your head in. The only positive I could come up with for this film was the acting. Naomi Watts is as solid as ever, and the rest of the cast do an adequate job with what little they have to work with. Otherwise, this is a complete misfire. It isn't scary, it doesn't make sense and you'll be hard pressed to find a worse horror film out there - and boy is that saying something."

It isn't that scary and maybe you have seen a lot of flicks in this kind but for me it wasn't that bad at all.It's the performance of Charlie Heaton (Stephen Portman) also famous for Stranger Things (2016) series that elevates this flick. What he does with his character from disabled to creep is outstanding. The fact that Naomie Watts plays his mum does give it an extra touch. On part of the story itself it may be all predictable and you can guess who's the stranger in house rather quickly but still it entertained me. There aren't many effects used, it's the house that must deliver and that one shot while Dr Wilson (Oliver Platt) is skyping with Mary (Watts) and he notices stranger things (hihi) going on.Not one for the horror geeks but if you do like home-invading flicks or a bit of suspense then this is worth seeing.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5"
" Wasted potential

As it turns out, our selective system saved me my money, though not my time since I still watched it eventually.From the trailer, I expected it to be predictable. How could it not be? However, predictable isn't always bad. Just because something's been done before doesn't mean it can't be done again and done well. This, sadly, does not fall into the latter category. There were only two ways that this was going to play out as far as culprits went, hence the predictability. I have to wonder if the writer/s even really tried, the writing was so lazy. I might actually have respected them more if they'd thrown in some random guy who'd been stalking her all along or if she'd really been insane, anything but it boiling down to the catatonic son or/and the weird little boy. But no, it went there. Over and over and over again. And of course we couldn't possibly have the characters make logical choices. God forbid these intelligent beings, psychiatrists no less, exhibit some kind of advanced thinking that would keep them out of danger once the cat was out of the bag. That would simply be asking too much.The acting was solid, as it should be for a talented cast and for at least a portion of the movie the suspense does pull you in, but then it falls and keeps falling before it dumps you into the cold, black lake in the woods. Literally. Charlie Heaton, who was my main reason for watching since I was riding the Stranger Things wave at the time, made me very uncomfortable as an unhinged teenager obsessed with his step-mother to the point of it being borderline incestuous. Or one could argue that he crossed that line with the bath scene.Considering how awful this movie was, I really should rate it lower but the scenery was beautiful, one of the things that really attracted me to it, and as I said the acting wasn't bad. The actors did the best with what they were given, however lacking. I can't in good conscience recommend it but if you really don't mind wasting 90 minutes..."

" Incoherently Shut In
",0.0,0.3644,2017-02-21 00:00:00,2,"This review of Shut In is spoiler free* (1/5)EVERY ONCE IN a while there will be a horror-thriller with an interesting premise, and for a while this will bode well for the film industry but then disaster strikes. There will be a film released when the thrills take ages to kick in which is interesting if it's done well, even Naomi Watts has been in a few of them Mulholland Drive and The Ring to name a couple.If it's done horribly nothing bodes well for the film, this shows in director Farren Blackburn's Shut In. Here Blackburn is away from his natural home of directing TV episodes (he's even been tasked for making the first episode of this year's Iron Fist). The film stars Watts as Mary Portman a Child Psychologist who works close to home. She has a good day working with a child until she gets the call that her 18 year-old stepson (Charlie Heaton) has been involved in a head-on collision, and he is paralyzed. She has to take care of his every need, bathe him, feed him and clothe him.For a while this isolation horror-thriller has an interesting premise, there are even a couple of gorgeous shot of Watts walking through the snow covered wooded environment outside her home. Unfortunately the screenplay written by Christina Hodson is garbage, and at points awkward down to a tee that it makes it hard for its main star to read out the lines. In addition with terrible performances, even at Watts' standards. There is a point in which Mary seeks help from her employer (Oliver Platt), she states that she is seeing a ghost of a child that she takes care for, he then says that ghosts don't exist she's just sleep deprived. It plays on this for quite some time not giving much information or any idea of where the film is heading.To an extent the film also involves pretentious jump scares, which appear in a theme, of she hears banging goes to investigate and it turns out to be a false alarm, or she is grabbed and scared half-to-death, this sparks a vulnerability theme. There are a lot of those feelings in this. It's not original. At this point there is no hope left for Shut In. Seemingly we wait for what feels like an eternity for something even remotely thrilling to happen, at which point we've had our thousandth yawn. To spark the audience's attention it calls the barricade & hunt style card, last year's The Boy played on that theme too. It doesn't need to be said, but it's fair to say this is a tired - frankly unoriginal, incoherent horror-thriller with nothing interesting going for it, it's just drivel we've seen before.VERDICT: A tired horror-thriller, with poor performances even by Watts' standards, and garbage screenplay. It'll be better to watch this while sleeping."

The tension builds nicely but I felt, the reveal was too sudden and robbed the film of much of the scare factor that had been built up to that point. The actions of the key character also seem a bit absurd at times as does the overall concept, which stretches credulity to a degree.In short, not a bad film if you like a few scares but regrettably nothing terribly special either. Six out of ten from me."

I'm pretty fine with the story, but there are a lot of missing parts that should be in the scene to make it much worth to be watched. Everything flows nicely with the background story of young Stephen who felt that he has been abandoned by his own mother because his mom pays more attention on her silent patient. Then, Stephen is just so jealous and he can't handle how hard that he knows the truth. However, I only can't get into my spot of my excitement while watching this movie and I don't find it is ""that"" thriller that I expected. It is more likely a family movie which is added by some shocking-scene seasoning disproportionately. It flows just like that with nothing thriller sensation stands out. It comes after one hour of flat story and finally this movie tickles me to watch till the end. Maybe it is more acceptable if the genre is family and drama."

She's also been in a number of great memorable performances. i fact, shes even been in good horror in the past. Years later she's in a really awful ""horror"" film that doesn't offer any thrills or chills but rather just insists on wasting your time.This film is about a psychologist, played by Watts, following a car accident that killed her husband and left her son paralyzed (played by Stranger Things' Charlie Heaton). She starts to think that someone is inside her house trying to harm her. Who could it be though? Her son is paralyzed and immobile? The plot doesn't even sound interesting and there really isn't anything in the film that you could actually enjoy. The film is devoid of any actual chills, the scenes meant to make you jump are set up in a way that is so manufactured over the years, where you know exactly what to expect.The film just kind of throws characters into the mix and you are left wondering what purpose they really serve? Poor Jacob Tremblay, going from a wonderful performance in Room, to being thrown into something like this. The twist ending is so awful. Its half expected but doesn't bother offering any consolation for wasting your time. There's honestly too much going on in this film, its too busy with people and trying too hard to deliver a substantial story but it comes off really uninspired, tired, and boring. The twist also offers some really weird awkward moments too.Check this out if you want but there's really nothing to see here. Shut yourself out.4/10"

I think it was a perfect movie i don't know why people have given below 5 rating with bad comments. For me if you have to watch a suspense/ thriller and horror movie then there are some rules to apply before watching. first you make an environment for the movie, you have no other work to do between the movie, you don't talk between the movie, you don't even miss a single dialogue, your lights should turn off so that your focus should be completely on the movie.
