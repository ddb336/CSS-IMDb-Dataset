" Quite Nice
",0.4754,0.8807,2021-03-19 00:00:00,9,It is a fantastic film with amazing actors. The visuals and storyline is a nice rendition of Frankensteins Monster.
" 0/10
",0.0,0.4767,2021-02-01 00:00:00,1,"We chose this for our bad movie night and it was perfectly ridiculous. The creativity is elementary at best, the acting is laughable, and script is nothing but tropes and clich√©s. The science was non-existent. I don't understand how this has 6/10."
" bad c movie in harrypotter filter
",-0.5423,-0.0258,2020-12-28 00:00:00,1,"The worst monster is the directors vision of Mary shelleys story. Its a terrible ugly overacted piece of junk movie. Frankenstein looks like a gremlin tincan, effects and produktion looks like a b netflix fantasy episode. Its just devoid of any artistic or good scenes. The only thing goding for it Is how pn earth could these A list actors agree to star in It. Didnt they have pocket money for McDonalds or something? Its the only main question to wonder."
" It has it's moments
",0.0,0.7264,2020-12-05 00:00:00,5,"This movie is kind of a homage to the Universal and Hammer Frankenstein movies while still managing to be its own thing. The movie is told from the perspective of the hunchback assistant Igor, who isn't really a hunchback, just a guy with a cyst who is cured and happens to be a medical genius.The movie builds up very slowly to the final act where the monster is finally created, and frankly, that's kind of where the movie falls apart.Nice touch to the inspector with the wooden arm, a callback to the inspector played by Lionel Atwell in Son of Frankenstein (and hilariously spoofed by Mel Brooks).I guess the problem with the movie is what is the lesson? The lesson from most versions of this story is don't meddle in God's domain. But the heroes never really suffer any consequences for creating the monster, and the monster really isn't that much of a threat.Also- the CGI Prototype Monkey Monster. Really, really bad CGI."
" Well worth watching
",0.4588,0.8754,2020-12-04 00:00:00,6,"First off, I will say that this movie is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. The writing could've been better,, the direction could've been better. Now,, that being said,,, I still thought it was pretty dang good. I'd say a 6.8McAvoy and Radcliffe together as Frankenstein and Igor?!? Are you kidding me? They were a perfect duo!! If nothing else, watch the movie to see them work together. (Also,, Lorelei is a nice character as well. üòç)So go watch it!"
" It didn't suck
",0.3412,0.9001,2020-11-24 00:00:00,6,Visually reminiscent of Sherlock and enjoyable in that way. Always love James McAvoy. Interesting take on Igor and creating the story from his perspective. It doesn't tug on the heartstrings the way I feel it should. It does not evoke any empathy towards any of the characters. Otherwise it's a decent ride.
" ""I will turn the tide of human existence here, tonight!""
",0.0,0.9755,2020-11-12 00:00:00,7,"There doesn't appear to be a lot of love for this latest reimagining of the classic Mary Shelley novel. Personally, I liked it, so maybe I caught it in just the right frame of mind. Placing Victor Frankenstein's (James McAvoy) assistant Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) as the central character was an interesting twist, by making him an equal in the quest to forge human life from the inanimate. I love the old time horror flicks of the Thirties and Forties in which some pseudo-scientific jargon is used to describe what the mad scientist was attempting to achieve. This story didn't go too far out on a limb in that regard, utilizing the theory of converting electrical energy into a biochemical equivalent, with a rabid, gone wrong chimpanzee as Frankenstein's first attempt. I've come on board as a tentative McAvoy fan ever since he portrayed the disturbed, personality riddled character Kevin Wendell Crumb in 2016's ""Split"" and the follow up in 2019, ""Glass"". Here he goes a bit more over the top in execution, almost verging on bat-s--t crazy in order to achieve his daring vision. A major component to the story is how Victor felt guilt and remorse over the death of his brother years earlier, and his resolve to correct the imbalance so to speak, by creating new life in his honor. The creature that resulted, the monster itself, was a grotesque amalgam of collected body parts, a standard feature of these numerous Frankenstein stories. I always wonder why the scientist couldn't simply take a deceased person and work the magic on him or her, but I guess then the story loses some of it's luster. This latest reinterpretation of the Frankenstein mythos combines elements of the 1931 movie original with a love story sub-plot that's visually exciting and well crafted. Fans of the original novel ought to give it a try."
" The imaginative origin story of Igor
",0.0,0.989,2020-11-01 00:00:00,3,"I loved the creative and imaginative origin story of Igor. The idea that he was an abused circus freak added a beautiful eye pleasing start to this film. There were some fun and creative scenes...and a few great Victorian costumes...and even some believable additions, like that Victor Frankenstein would experiment on animals first before delving in to humans, but in the end the story fizzled out and didn't really hold my interest. This was a shame because it did start with a lot of promise and McAvoy did a wonderful job playing the crazed Dr.Frankenstein. It did end on an interesting note that leaves Igor getting the girl and Victor going off to potentially start his experiments all over agin...maybe. This film needed more and a better looking monster, that was more in line with the rest of the film. Clever, clever start however."
" A re-imagining that fails
",-0.4215,0.5313,2020-10-08 00:00:00,5,"I am a big fan of Frankenstien movies, in particular the Universal and Hammer classics. I am also open minded enough to appreciate famous stories completely reworked, as we have here. Sadly, despite a largely excellent cast, wonderful sets and plenty of action Victor Frankenstein is not a very good film. Far too much emphasis on the two characters of Victor and Igor (who's hunched back is actually a ludicrously huge abscess), if you want some monster action then it is a very long wait. Gaping plot holes, very far fetched scenes,some weak attempts at humour and a running time that started to induce boredom for me I am afraid that whilst not a bad movie VF is a one of my least favourite Frankensteins, and I have seen plenty."
" Meh. Not what it should have been
",-0.0772,0.7387,2020-10-07 00:00:00,4,"Told from Igor's perspective, this is a
seriously underwhelming take on the classic story, even the ending with all the ridiculous explosions & OTT performances culminating in the death of the ""monster"" literally minutes after gaining life.
Quite simply this didn't live up to what it should have been, the story of the brilliant scientist & his decent into madness & ultimately his death at the hands of his creation as seen through the eyes of igor, shelley's original story had no such character, Victor frankenstein had no lab assistant, the character was introduced in the 1931 movie ""Frankenstein"" a hunchback lab assistant by the name of fritz, the movie also introduced the idea of using lightning to create electricity to imbue the ""monster"" with life, again this was not from shelley's novel, in shelley's novel the character Victor Frankenstein spent several years piecing together his creation & it was brought to life using the unknown secret to life he had discovered
This movie suffered from far too much screen time of each character trying to out perform each other & the ridiculous ""Hollywood"" big explosion ending was laughable instead of meaningful.
You would think that with a rather small budget of $65 million this movie would have at least broke even instead of making a loss of $30 million.
Really have no idea what Max Landis had in mind with the script other than telling the tale of Victor Frankenstein & his friend the "" Guy Ritchie way"" which is rather boring, reducing the involvement of the ""monster"" down to a few minutes at the end was a huge mistake, very few people read the novel for anything other than the ""monster"", even less watch a movie for anything other than Frankenstein's ""monster"" , the mistake with this production is thinking an audience would be interested in the scientist & the characters around him.
Max Landis is clearly a very talented young man but this movie simply had no heart or soul, had ""Igor"" been the hunchback overworked under appreciated lab assistant & the story was told from his perspective it would probably have been interesting even entertaining, which this movie is not, let's hope he does a better job with the remake of the classic ""an American werewolf in London""."
" Not accurate to the book but still good.
",0.5927,-0.7197,2020-09-22 00:00:00,7,"Not accurate to the original source material but still good. Not a masterpiece but but evolves the traditional story and still kits some f the main points. Victor is egotistical, conniving, jealous and alone. By the end he still is but has actually changed and grown. It's a decent watch but doesn't deserve the crap it gets."
" A creative retelling of a classic.
",0.4404,0.9924,2020-08-30 00:00:00,7,"It's the story of Professor Frankenstein and his creation as you'd expect, but it's primarily the study of Igor, his man servant, we get his history, his present, and a glimpse into his future.It's a very good film, it's very nicely made, beautifully acted, it's a very nice gothic drama. I would argue it's not a horror as the classification states, if you are wanting lots of Monster action there isn't a great deal of that, what there is looks fantastic.Great special effects, particularly at the dramatic finale, it looks terrific.Not sure which of the two was billed as the star of the show, maybe an equal billing, but Radcliffe is excellent. I love how on occasion you hear McAvoy's wonderful Scottish accent peep through.Clever and well made, 7/10."
" A really good movie
",0.4927,0.9773,2020-08-14 00:00:00,8,"It's a Drama movie where they tell the story behind the creation of Frankenstein. It is not a horror movie, it has elements of horror but definitely not horror, sci-fi yes, horror no! Watch it for what it is! It's a nice movie with incredible cinematography & great soundtrack, I recommend this movie! üëçüèΩ"
" It is not the classic story
",0.0,0.9365,2020-07-09 00:00:00,10,"Such an underrated movie. People complaining about the story, but this story is more about the creation of Igor and relationship with Victor. Something different, but good. I cannot find anything to criticize. Brilliant acting, perfect costumes and music."
" Fun, fairly fright-free, festive fayre for the telly...
",0.743,0.9507,2020-06-29 00:00:00,6,"This started out quite well with James McEvoy (""Frankenstein"") rescuing Dan Radcliffe from a life as a hunchback in the circus when he discovers that he has a bit off a penchant for medicine. They escape back to this lair and after a bit of rudimentary surgery, Dan has lost his hump and is fitting nicely into a costume left over from Spartacus and answering to ""Igor"". Once we do get over the intros, though, it reverts very much to type as hybrid of Hammer meets James Whale. There is good chemistry between the two stars; the script is at times quite funny and well paced; but there just isn't enough originality to distinguish it from it's multitude of forbears. Andrew Scott is the detective aided by a very trim Callum Turner as they try to track down the experimenting pair, but on this occasion Scott adds little and Freddie Fox , well least said. The last fifteen minutes redeem it, somewhat, too - plenty of good, lively visual and sound effects as we head to the conclusion. ""It's got thunder, it's got lightning..."""
" A movie about the most civilised era
",0.0,0.9967,2020-04-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie is exceedingly British and I love that. I don't want to go into too much detail with this review, but there were so many great things about this movie to the extent I could write a lengthy book about the things I admired in this film.The accents were sublime and posh, the technology of the era was just about right without going too over the top and making people weird and anti-social and due to the lack of cars and relatively slow movement of people it makes me appreciate my lovely electric bike much more, when I'm doddering along at 15 mph on it I think back to those Victorians in this film who would've been delighted with such quick speeds, I fantasise about Victor accompanying me on his steampunk steam powered bike doing 15 mph and having a great laugh with him, my imaginary friend known as Victor Frankenstein wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for this film. All the characters seem so politically sane in this film which is a very refreshing breather from today's harsh, stupid political climate.Also the monster at the end of this film looks very tasty so this film always gives me a great appetite and gives me a longing for some delicious rats, balut, black pudding and mum's foot sweat every time I watch this amazing film. The scenery was truly beautiful and the scenes of London outside made me smell the sweet smell of steam power which made me nostalgic for the old steam ralleys I went to as a kid. You'll enjoy this film if you're British but I don't recommend it to Americans as Americans would probably get too jealous of Victorian London."
" So much potential
",0.0,0.8546,2020-03-22 00:00:00,10,"I am giving a 10 because I think many of the other reviews are unfair. It had many elements of a great movie but, like a lot of other movies these days, were so interesting in setting up the sequel, destroyed the end and in doing so, failed at a great opportunity to tie everything together."
" weak remake
",-0.4404,0.0,2020-02-06 00:00:00,4,"The story knows almost everyone and nothing new has been added.
The plot was predictable and therefore a bit boring.
Once seen and that's it. I'm sure I won't see this movie a second time."
" Good movie
",0.4404,0.8316,2019-11-20 00:00:00,8,A fun movie more about the story behind the story we all know. I watch for entertainment and I was entertained.
" For the Love of Igor
",0.6369,0.9571,2019-11-19 00:00:00,5,"This adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel is quite intelligent in its premise and works well for a good part of the duration. It works despite the fact that the scriptwriters took many liberties with the limits of credibility too soon, suddenly transforming the hunchbacked circus clown not only into an erect monkey, but one full of social graces. It also never assumes the homoeroticism that permeates all the story, but it may be asking too much of a product conceived for assiduous mall crowds and related. So, Victor and Igor and the rest are surrounded by good production design and their performances are credible but clich√© (sad and hunchbacked clown, arrogant and boisterous medicine genius): then all the honors go for Andrew Scott as Inspector Turpin, an agent of Scotland Yard, a ruthless and pharisee Catholic fanatic. But then... psychologism bursts in (with the secondary plot about brother Henry Frankenstein, family motivations, tears and that stuff) and the whole construction collapses and never recovers. At least Hitchcock waited until the end to introduce those exasperating explanations of Psychology 101 (usually worthy of a Venezuelan-Mexican soap opera) in the culmination of ""Psycho"" that almost destroy the fine edifice built in the preceding minutes. That ""fine edifice"" was so good, that we willingly forgave Hitchcock's impudence... But this is not the case."
" Dynamic and exciting rendition based in the legendary tale by Mary Shelley , with a good cast
",0.8271,0.9976,2019-11-09 00:00:00,7,"In London while the young medical student Viktor Frankenstein , James McAvoy , is watching a circus spectacle , a trapezist falls down , then he and hunchback Igor , Daniel Radcliffe, help save her : Jessica Brown Findlay .Later on, they are attacked by other circus members, fighting and dying one of them.

Andrew Scott. Both, Frankenstein and Igor, become good friends and the latter helps him in his experiments . By the way Frankenstein is working on finding a way to give life by reanimating dead tissue through electricity, being helped by Igor.This thrilling story is told from Igor's perspective , it develops the peculiar relationship between the impulsive , obstinate , but sympathetic Frankenstein and his naive assistant Igor . This is a particular recreation of the classic novel with script by Max Landis and several changes from original . Here Frankenstein is a radical but agreeable scientific who will stop at nothing to make his creature . Director Paul McGuigan develops some really chilling scenes, with amazing moments and various powerful images, especially when the creature is reborn, including an interesting storyline. The highlights of the movie are the beginning at the circus as well as the transformation's process of a deformed clown, Igor, into a handsome young thanks to ambitious , stubborn scientist Frankenstein .And thrilling and espectacular final, being frighteningly well made, and set at a Scottish Castle where takes place impressive scenes of resurrection and confrontation.The picture was compellingly played by Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy , along with the attractive Jessica Brown Findlay . And a fine support cast as Andrew Scott , Alistair Petrie , Bronson Webb, Mark Gatiss and veteran Charles Dance.It contains an evocative and sensitive musical score by Craig Armstrong . As well as a colorful and adequate cinematography by Fabian Wagner. The motion picture was competently directed by Paul McGuigan . He is a good craftsman who has made some successes as Push , Lucky number Slevin , Wicker park , The Reckoning , Gangster number 1, The Acid house , among others. Rating : 6.5/10.

" Great actors, really weird storyline
",0.4779,0.4853,2019-11-05 00:00:00,6,"I've never read the book 'Frankenstein'. So I went into this movie blindly. I'm a James McAvoy fan. And I think he did a splendid job in his character for the film.
However, the storyline itself is really weird. And it seems like it was slapped together at last call at the bar, because not much thought went into it so it appears. The first 20 minutes prove exciting, but then it goes downhill after that.
I do find it unfair that it was considered a box office bomb, considering the actors and the attempt of special effects. But since then, the actors have continued to make successful films despite it. I'm giving it a 6 due to the acting."

" Man is always the worst monster of them all.
",-0.6249,0.8709,2019-10-06 00:00:00,6,"With the credit for the screen story and screenplay going to Max Landis (son of John), the film ""Victor Frankenstein"" tells the now very familiar tale of mad scientist Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) attempting to play God, defy death, and create life. This time, however, the tale is told from the perspective of his loyal assistant ""Igor"" (Daniel Radcliffe), whom he rescues from a sad life as an abused, hunchbacked clown in a circus. Victor is impressed with the clowns' knowledge of anatomy and ability to improvise, and so a collaboration is born.But Igor still has something of a moral compass, and worries when Victor plans on taking their experiments ""too far"". Meanwhile, the two of them earn an adversary in a religious Scotland Yard detective (Andrew Scott) who believes that he has a moral obligation to foil the not-so-good doctor.This viewer didn't find this film boring so much as just ridiculous, with some story developments and details that were simply laughable. And yet, everybody plays this very straight, and the material is not played as a parody or spoof (a la ""Young Frankenstein"" or even ""The Horror of Frankenstein""). Frankenstein story traditionalists might take strong exception to the new twists on the tale.But ""Victor Frankenstein"" is at least a good looking picture, if not as thickly atmospheric as any of the old Universal horror features of the 1930s and 1940s. It's well designed (by Eve Stewart) and photographed (by Fabian Wagner, in widescreen), and includes a thunderous, ominous music score by Craig Armstrong. The effects are variable: Victor & Igor's first creation is a hideous chimpanzee abomination named ""Gordon"", and the final Monster, otherwise known as ""Prometheus"", is a bulky beast that looks more like David Prowse in ""The Horror of Frankenstein"" than the traditional Boris Karloff-like image.The actors keep this watchable. Radcliffe is earnest as the protagonist who gets a vigorous makeover from Victor. McAvoy is an effectively looney Victor, giddy at times and lost in his own ambition. Jessica Brown Findlay is lovely and engaging as the trapeze artist who Igor has always adored. Freddie Fox is amusing as the morally bankrupt, sleazy rich kid who takes an interest in Victors' work. Scott plays his role *extremely* straight, with barely a change in his facial expression. Charles Dance is wasted in a one-scene role as Victors' disapproving father.All in all, this viewer was reasonably entertained by this florid variation on the Frankenstein legend, but others may not be as forgiving or kind towards it.Six out of 10."

The zapping Tesla coils, the barking-mad doctor, the moldering thing stirring to life on the platform under the storm - Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" has long since become part of our cultural and cinematic DNA. Is there any way to defibrillate this story back to life?Director Paul McGuigan (""Wicker Park"") and screenwriter Max Landis (son of ""Animal House"" director John) have a novel approach: They make Igor the hero. Yes, that's the former Harry Potter, Daniel Radcliffe, as the cringing circus hunchback who just happens to be a skilled, self-taught surgeon and whose talents are recognized by the passing Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy), who just happens to be needing a partner for his experiments in re-animating dead flesh. Within minutes of meeting Igor, the good doctor has literally straightened him out. To quote a knowledgeable source: Hump?

I already thought he was a good actor and he's been in a bunch of movies I like, but after this I added him to my list of favorite actors. Funny that it was from a crappy movie. X-men did a great job of getting him and Fassbender as replacements (1 viewing)"
" Well made!
",0.3382,0.9758,2019-06-11 00:00:00,9,"The movie is different from the original story but the main idea that always attracted readers and made people think is still there and it was really well made, the acting and the scenario were great! The story was different and that's why you can't expect what will happen in every single scene, which I think is interesting. I just loved the movie."
" Sorry, but this is the Best Version - Victor Frankenstein
",0.7684,0.9781,2019-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Other than Young Frankenstein, which is one of the greatest comedies of all time, this Frankenstein film is the best of the several versions I have seen (and I have seen all of them). Even with the excessive pathos in the beginning of the film, it still resonates with a brilliant two-man performance, worthy of those seen in films like Becket and Sleuth by both Daniel Radcliffe as a combination of the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the clown who cries inside and James McAvoy, with a measured, yet over-the-top Victor. The screenplay is beautifully written by Max Landis and the pacing of the film by director Paul McGuigan is impeccable. The acting reminded me of Henry V, and the monster reminded me of Prometheus. A wonderfully made film. A must-see."
" Visually entertaining
",0.4404,0.6854,2019-04-28 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie in a different language and at times with no volume
So, aside from a couple of weird , like 2 , quick cgi/creature choices. It was visually exciting movie and the acting was so beautiful that I felt it , even without understanding the words. I do not like when reviewers rate something then add that they didn't watch the whole thing I watched the whole thing but can't vouch for the script in this review."
" It's a evil
",-0.6597,0.9909,2019-04-09 00:00:00,6,"It's madness to think that of all the screen adaptations of Mary Shelley's novel virtually none of them have been source accurate. Even Kenneth Branagh's 1994 campfest took liberties. To be honest, I don't think the novel is really that good, but I do love anything featuring the monster, even Herman Munster, so I'm a sucker for multiple adaptations and such.This time around we have a foaming-mad Frankenstein played enthusiastically by James McAvoy with Daniel Radcliffe as his hunchback assistant Igor, liberated from the circus and his hunch drained of fluid so he can stand upright. He's the best character in the movie. Together they, slowly, plan to create their own living creature made from spare animal parts and graduate from a revolting humunculous to, eventually, the monster, for about 5 minutes.The first and last act of this movie is where the fun and excitement are. The middle section really drags though, with too many scenes inside the lab and not enough suspense or action. The movie was shot in 2013 but not released until the latter part of 2015. I wonder if there were behind-the-scenes troubles or difficulty editing the story. It might explain why a good 35 minutes feel so tedious.Sadly, the iconic monster design is a copyright of Universal Studios so any other studio wishing to make a Frankenstein movie must come up with a new look, which is what they seem to go for here. But Victor Frankenstein is a complete overhaul of the story, switching from Geneva to London and for the gothic castle to a Scottish ruin. It lacks the archaic European pathos that other adaptions have had in their favour.The lovely cinematography makes the movie a delight to look at though. It's surely the best looking Frankenstein to date. Paul McGuigan's visual style adds a lot of production value to a movie that could have been straight-to-Prime trash. It's a shame it didn't do better at the box office.Worth your time, just don't get frustrated with the dull middle section."

The original is the story of the heart, the workings on man, so is this. Because you know how the story is to end, the writer makes great use of foreshadowing dialogue. The is some gore, but it is not scary or a horror movie. If that is what you are looking for you will be sadly disappointed."
" Brilliant U.K. movie. Sadly, reviewed by U.S. critics.
",-0.0516,0.676,2018-10-11 00:00:00,10,"U.S. critics are the worst when given a brilliant British film. For the record, I have never watched a single Harry Potter movie as the books were never my cup of tea. As such, I have no bias on Daniel Radcliffe going into this. Ten minutes in and I was hooked. Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy fit so well, I believe this is how Shelley envisioned her story played out. Both pulled out the stops. The madness and antiquated genius The set is a great as it looks very real and makes you want to believe that a monster could be created in that laboratory. I bet if the producers had added a little Victorian nudity, sexual intrigue, gritty language, or something else to bring this into the R rated realm, something that drives American Hollywood films, this surely would have been seen as a box office smashing success. It has a macabre and visceral quality that more non r rated horror and science fiction movies should have. It harks back to the days of cleaner Hammer Horror films or Price and Lorre."
" Good re-imagining which focuses on Igor's character
",0.4404,0.9991,2018-09-23 00:00:00,8,"Since he was little, Igor had a lot of suffering to endure. We follow a small part of his troubled past but focus later on the events which follow his meeting with Victor Frankenstein, one which will change his life forever, for better or worse. This reimagining of the famous story about Frankenstein, told from Igor's perspective, brings together two actors which I personally like very much. They manage to create a credible bond between two likeable although quite different characters whose story is presented together with its ups and downs. The plot presented is quite good, although a bit predictable from time to time, thanks to the famous nature of the material it's based on. It brings an exciting intrigue, builds up suspense and drama, while ending pretty unexpected, in a good way, at least as far as I'm concerned.The character development is also good, managing to transmit a lot solely by expression, let along words or actions. They bring emotion, excitement and suspense but the movie could arguably have done better regarding this aspect, especially if it had a better ""antagonist"". I'm referring of course to the inspector whose actions and especially facial expression seem lame, although he seems to be determined to prove his point and solve the case. The acting or his character could clearly have been better as you don't get to feel his presumed determination and this is quite a shame.The universe described on the other hand is very credible, dark and even gruesome, making it a very suitable place for the events to take place. The movie uses some pretty neat graphic overlays which do a very good job in describing what is about to happen. Also, it uses an interesting artistic direction or better said filming style, which left me with a positive feeling. They've done a very good job in this department and their work can be clearly seen in this film.Overall, I found it to be a good movie. Great actors, mostly great characters, a good plot and an unique artistic direction contribute to a movie which kept me interested until the end and even made me lust for more. Its apparently few and small flaws on the other hand made it lose a bit of polish which could have made it great."
" Simply stunning!

The first thing I loved about the film was the fantastic visuals, and the great photography. From an acting perspective, James McAvoy was wonderful, as was Daniel Radcliffe. Their different characters - yet with the same goal - complemented the film.I loved the music, the emotion, the look and feel of the film, the script, the dialogue, the acting, the style, EVERYTHING!

",0.2732,0.9187,2018-08-27 00:00:00,3,"""You know this story,"" Daniel Radcliffe's Igor repeatedly states in voiceover narration, as if trying to excuse the movie's being in a field of numerous Frankenstein films. I wonder, however, did the filmmakers know this story and which story exactly are they referring to? It can't be Mary Shelley's novel. I've read that, and this is not that. I suppose the story they meant are those in the classic Universal monster movies, mainly ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939), which is where the characters of Igor and an inspector with an artificial arm originate.Igor, the protagonist and narrator in this iteration, is entirely different than Bela Lugosi's version, though, as is Andrew Scott's religious-zealot Inspector compared to that of Lionel Atwill's. Igor's hunched back is fixed by Victor Frankenstein after he is rescued from the circus, whereupon he becomes a romantic figure for the new character of Lorelei, a trapeze performer who in turn had her life saved by Igor. Meanwhile, Victor is another atheist mad scientist adulteration of Shelley's character. He had an older brother named Henry--the name of the Frankenstein in the 1931 and 1935 films and the first name of Victor's friend in the book. His death is the impetus for Victor's efforts to create life, a role in the novel better occupied by his mother, but the brother angle suits this movie's purposes for the parallel brotherly friendship between Victor and Igor, for whatever that's worth. One other Frankenstein film that this one imitates, intentionally or not, is ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974) when Lorelei mispronounces Frankenstein's name--reminds me of better times watching Gene Wilder explain the proper pronunciation of his name in that film's parodying of the Universal series.I wonder why they didn't make Lorelei into Mary Shelley, who then could've become the author of the story, which would explain why Igor keeps saying we know this story, which makes no sense within the film's world otherwise--in fact, Victor contradicts that very statement in the end. The circus stuff should probably be changed, then, perhaps to drowning, which played an important part in the real Shelley's life and which would work as well as Lorelei's fall from the trapeze act to parallel Victor's later reanimation experiments. As it is, this only female character in the movie is utterly unnecessary. I mean, is she only there so that we don't think the guys are gay?The only appropriate addition this movie makes to the story is Finnegan, who bankrolls Frankenstein's experiments. This is how Victor goes from creating an ugly hybrid chimp to a giant monstrosity in a lab staffed with lackeys and corporate oversight. It's an apt analogy for a mainstream Hollywood movie that was never a good idea to begin with. Its re-imagining of the familiar story boiling down to a sophomoric morality tale of the dangers of playing God, as an excuse for a few action scenes, characters jumping off things to throw punches included, and a couple friendships whose lack of interest is entirely undeserving of the concluding slow-mo melodrama."

His corporal expression is extraordinary in my opinion, and he shows it beautifully in this movie. James McCoy is a beast! I have now watched almost his entire filmography. You can see how much energy and commitment he puts into his characters. His performances overwhelm me, he is just great. And Jessica Brown Findlay is a doll, delicate and also very expressive. They all together have amazing chemistry in this movie. The scenes are nicely shot, the photography is amazing, music is good. And surprisingly I liked the way the story was told even though very different from what everybody knows about Frankenstein. If you're looking for entertainment, I highly recommend this one!"

While essentially a Gothic action movie, the chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy is good, but the film steadily comes apart at the seams (poor stitching?) due to the increasing number of characters that progressively appear, such as the dogged police detective, a romantic love interest, and a hastily tacked on villain with a rather undeveloped motive. As such, the narrative is never fully complete and feels lacking in terms of plot. This is especially evident in the finale in which Victor strangely seems to bring his creation to life within a Bond villain's secret lair (that indeed pretty much ends up exploding). Further, the hurried nature of the final act may be due to reedits as Mark Gatiss suddenly appears from nowhere, and has but one brief line, which seems odd if you are going to recruit one of the famed League of Gentleman, so I suspect his role was initially more substantial. However, the reanimated creature gets a little bit of 'Hulk smash!"" action, and actually looks pretty good. So, a enjoyable enough film, but in the end even Victor Frankenstein could not fully animate all of the disparate parts and make them come to life, and like the monster chimp that runs amok in said film, it all just kind of runs out of energy."

" ""I looked into the eyes and there was nothing there!""
",0.0,0.9799,2018-05-10 00:00:00,7,"""I looked into the eyes and there was nothing there!""It would be unpleasant of me to direct this quote from Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) towards James McAvoy's performance as Frankenstein, but it isn't without a certain truth here. As with his turn in 2016's inexplicably acclaimed 'Split', his every movement, intonation, posture, grin and gesticulation never lets us forget he is acting. With sentences instilled with dangerous singularity, McAvoy spits out the words in textbook eccentric, rapid staccato. He is indulged by Paul McGuigan's excellent direction and looks great, but rather like a stage turn projecting to the back rows, there is not one ounce of anything naturalistic about his Victor Frankenstein. Perhaps it is deliberate; the confidence, bravura, enthusiasm, heightened unreality might be traits attributed to Frankenstein - or to these heightened performances in general - but unlike co-star Daniel Radcliffe's Igor (for example, and other characters too), we never *know* him, never like/dislike him, never really care for him, not even when the truth is revealed about his brother (Henry, brother of Victor: two of the most often-used names for Baron Frankenstein over the decades). As with all things, I can only offer my opinion on this.The long-awaited creation scene is spectacular. Occasionally threatening to lose hold of reality, it nevertheless takes advantage of modern filming technology; we can actually travel along the power-lines with the electrodes as they head for the inanimate creature. Whereas the first experiment involved a hellish and extremely effective chimpanzee amalgamation, the eventual human monster is battered and torn by the elements even before (or perhaps during) a time when life has been given him. A clay-like golem, he is a spectacle, but has no time to be anything more. An enhanced, stomping killer hulk that brings the house down.In two pleasing (deliberate or otherwise) nods to past glories, the police inspector Roderick Turpin (Andrew Scott) loses a hand (√† la one-armed Inspector Krogh from 1939's 'Son of Frankenstein') and the monster is animated only to wreck the laboratory and bring things to a close of sorts (√† la the monster rallies at the end of the 1930/40's Universal run of pictures). Despite my reservations about McAvoy's performance, I enjoyed this a lot. It breathes new life into the pioneering story, which is no mean feat after all these decades, whilst never losing the guiding light of Mary Shelley's original novel."

Igor starts out as a circus hunchback whose medical skills and genius is recognized by Dr. Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy). His rescue from the circus involved a ruckus and a death, which is being investigated by Scotland Yard detective Rafferty (Bronson Webb) who puts together an unbelievable report of ""high society hunchback and undead monsters.""The film is also theme and theologically loaded with numerous statements such as Victor Frankenstein proclaiming, ""God has no authority here"" while being warned ""There is no mercy in nature."" The film also discusses Victor's past, need for a financial benefactor, and Igor having a love interest (Jessica Brown Findlay.) This brings in more characters, turning the feature into a drama with moments of dark humor and horror.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Monster horror.There are numerous wisps within the film that are references to previous Frankenstein films that may go unnoticed such as the mispronunciation of the name as was done in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. The name Rafferty for the Scotland Yard detective immediately brought to mind the song ""Baker Street"" by Gerry Rafferty which was also the residence of Sherlock Holmes."

For some reason I liked the story been told from his point of view. Another interesting bit is when you are from a place like Ghana in West Africa, you don't grow up knowing much about America myths (because of course you have your own country specific myths to worry about) so a story like Frankenstein's was known to me wayyyyy older in my life, and frankly all I can remember about it is the Monster not the Man. This adaptation, for me reveals somewhat the MAN not so much the monster."
" Good acting, poor script, no soul
",-0.34,0.9928,2018-04-18 00:00:00,4,"I'll start this review by praising the film: it is, aesthetically, an awesome movie. All the elements are in the right place, the gothic victorian circuses, hospitals, city, universities, the production design for this film is astonishingly detailed, as is the makeup, costume design and the locations they chose. The acting is excellent at some extent, let's say, from the beginning to the middle of the film. I wouldn't blame the actors though, even with Daniel Radcliffe going a little bit Potteresque - as in an useless protagonist - from the middle onwards. But i believe that's more a fault of the script and maybe the director, than the actor. Editing, music, mixing, photography, special effects, all ok. Direction: could be better. The experience is a lot worse when you've seen Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994), and start comparing the two movies. Instead of taking in and widening the more humanistic, polemical view on morality, or on an illuminated argument of science versus faith, which the script actually points to be going to when the inspector - in the only acting highlight on the whole film - challenges the mad scientist who at this point is not so mad, this fine line turns into dust we see it wreck into common drama (the tragic loss of someone dear) and some quite corny action (?) scenes. As most people, I really didn't like the ending. It's very segregated, too quick and lacks argument and acting. It has just one scene that could be better played and a lot of production show off. One other way to bring it would be to go deeper on Dr. Frankestein's madness. The title character only shows conflict barely, never taking a reflection on what could easily build a good monologue. James McAvoy is such a talented artist, it would be nice to watch him develop on this character, to give it a more ""you would do it if you were in my place"" kind of moment, to let the viewers savor their inner mad scientists a little. The love romance is absolutely dispensable. The female character is very much reduced to absolutely nothing, to irrelevance, wasting such a good actress. Wouldn't be missed if it was edited out. The female presence could be better used, it is a shame it wasn't. As is the family drama, which spawned just one, completely frivolous, little scene. Could be better used, maybe not concurring with the main argument as it actually is (sanity, morality). It could be a better movie if the writer took the opportunity to write a better script (or if the executive producers didn't meddle, I really don't know what happened). I'm sure the actors could play whatever twist nicely. But here the director had also an opportunity to right some wrongs, and I'm sure he did a little. But it feels like at some point he got tired of going against the stream and just let the script show itself. As the credits rolled up, I couldn't help thinking that a budget of 40 million dollars could be better used to pay the debts of some really poor countries. Instead of that we have a not so awesome movie with no soul whatsoever that will entertain very few people."

That doesn't make it perfect, however. I found this just about watchable but that's as far as it goes. The 'hook' is that the film's central figure isn't Frankenstein but rather his hunchbacked servant Igor, an important figure in the Universal classic THE SON OF FRANKENSTEIN but one who has been neglected in recent years. Daniel Radcliffe plays Igor in a semi-successful performance although he seems to think he's in a more comedic film than those around him. James McAvoy is Frankenstein himself and better, with his usual intensity. The film generally keeps you watching to a degree, although I found it to be lacking in many memorable moments aside from the OTT climax."

If you like Daniel Radcliff you may like this movie. Personally, I saw him as Harry Potter through the whole film. The movie was heavy on story, but I personally felt the story was ""meh""... That could be biased, however, since I like comedy and/or action mixed in with the story quite a lot, and this was lacking in both.

The music and photography are excellent and the set and costume people create an excellent picture of Victorian London.I particularly liked the idea of the film being told from the POV of Igor.On the negative side, Daniel Radcliffe's performance added very little and the film was a tad too long.There is nothing to match the 1931 original nor the 1935 Bride of Frankenstein, but otherwise this film holds up well against the hundreds of other Frankenstein films.

It's odd, since there was no assistant in Mary Shelley's original novel, least of all a hunchbacked one. But here we get Igor's backstory and how he came to know the doctor whose name is synonymous with bad science, and how they set about animating a dead body.Unfortunately, much of the movie is sort of silly. Although I liked how the depicted the police inspector as a hardcore Christian fanatic who considers science a form of witchcraft - sounds like a lot of Christians today, doesn't it?* - the movie goes too far on CGI. This isn't something of which Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy should be proud. It's not a bad movie, but it shouldn't be your first choice.

I can't pin point the piece of the puzzle that was missing in the director's vision.

This is a good film, but it doesn't seem to be the movie anyone would expect it to be. Daniel slays as Igor and James as Victor, however this movie gets in it's own way and is more often then not just plodding along at a snails pace. The idea was there, this movie could have been a 10 star film, but the execution was messy and incompetent and this is to the films detriment.

" Good To Watch On Rainy Day But Nothing Outstanding
",-0.5469,0.9937,2017-05-01 00:00:00,6,"The opening statements to ""Victor Frankenstein"" is ""you know the story..."" and indeed we all know from the pages of Mary Shelley's classic horror novel from 1818 and to the numerous adaptations that gave graced the silver screens. Here we have another take from the classic story that's an added addition towards the other previous adaptations. Director Paul McGuigan collaborated with scriptwriter Max Landis gives us an original take of the movie seen for once through the eyes of Dr. Frankenstein's humble assistant Igor Strausman (Daniel Radcliffe). We first meet Igor as a nameless hunchbacked circus clown who had to encounter a lot of physical abuse all for the sake of entertainment. When not pleasing the crowd, Igor also serves as a physician to the other acts. When an incident involving a trapeze artist goes awry, Igor is introduced to Dr. Frankenstein (James McAvoy).Feeling that his gifts are being wasted, Frankenstein frees Igor from this uncompromising lifestyle to come work with him. Their escape wasn't easy because a strong man, a knife thrower and several performers were on their tails. The estate Dr. Frankenstein calls home resembles a posh and resourceful science laboratory. After removing a cyst, and replacing a back brace concealer on him, Dr. Frankenstein adopts him the name of Igor Strausman. It seems the Frankenstein and Igor were once roommates who was once involved in taking part in recreational drugs who's been MIA for a while. With a hired assistant, Frankenstein can now propose his latest creation that will make him famous.Set in the murky and dreary 19th century London, the movie takes in the effort of going for a new approach to the lore of Frankenstein by narrating the story seen through the eyes of Igor for a change. However, it still doesn't seem to stand up to the other adaptations based on Shelley's novel. It looks like its teetering towards an origin tale, but it never goes to deeper scrutiny as to how Dr. Frankenstein got the notion of bringing the deceased back to life. There's a few snippets of Victor's childhood involving his father's visitation (Charles Dance, but it offers very little insight.Thrown in the thick of things is Inspector Turpin (Andrew Scott) who's called to the scene to investigate on stolen animal parts missing from the London Zoo and the Royal Veterinary College and murder at the scene of the circus. Turpin suspects Victor and Igor are up to something as his investigation leads toward their path. Turpin tries to challenge Victor's progressive points of view with Turpin's having more religious way of thinking. The whole science vs. religion conflict is handled subtle but to the point along with the contrasting wardrobes the two rivals wear. Victor is seen wearing flashy colourful clothing while Turpin's choice of clothing is mundane and in grey.As we get to know Victor and Igor, their friendship is stronger to the point of bordering towards homosexuality. But that theory gets put to rest once Igor develops an infatuation with trapeze artist Lorelai (Jessica Brown Findlay). Like Igor she left the circus and has lived a life of freedom. Lorelai catches onto Victor and Igor's creation and it's this scene plus the unveiling of their creation that make up for the rather mundane dialogue throughout most of the film. Sure we may see the sci-fi genre come alive here, but it's only very sporadic when more could have been added on to hold your interest.Radcliffe tries to make us forget about Harry Potter and succeeds in making a morally inclined character in Igor as he clings onto his new life by staying loyal to his master while questioning if playing God is good or bad. McAvoy clearly is the star here as he plays Frankenstein with dimensions ranging from a delusional lunatic to a lighter funny side with his interactions with Igor. There's some great chemistry between McAvoy and Radcliffe, if only they had a more competent direction of where they were going with the story they'd be better.So while it is mildly enthralling to watch, and the special effects are quite eye-catching, with some light humour and good action to keep one intrigued. It's a good watch for a rainy afternoon, just don't expect any drastic impact compared to the other interpretations from the other adaptations from the classic Mary Shelley novel."

James McAvoy is Victor Frankenstein, rescuing abused hunchback Daniel Radcliffe and renaming him Igor after de-humping him by removing the liquid from a severe growth. He knows that the newly monikered Igor is a genius when it comes to medical procedures and utilizes him in his bizarre scientific experiments. It's up to the moral Igor to stop McAvoy from going too far, which is an understatement considering his plans.Starting off perfectly fine, this quickly descends into predictable melodrama and noisy, dizzifying camera work, and even a disturbing creature I can only refer to as Frankenchimp. Not giving you moments to think or breathe, it goes right back to the issues of 1994's ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" which tried too hard to engage its audiences through visual tricks.Looking like Vincent Price at the height of his American International. Edgar Alan Poe era, McAvoy is far too intense, melodramatic and yet not quite camp. Radcliffe manages to be subtle and seems to be trying to tone what the legend of Igor was, much like the melodramatic manner that Robert De Niro attempted to play the creature. It just gets to be too much rushed together, and even with the look of authenticity towards the setting never really completely gels."

This story is simple and does not need telling, we all know it but briefly, it's about a man who discovers he can make 'life out of death' using electrical power (since all cells function by electrical current), and he does against the law in secrecy in his 'mad lab' by picking up leftover organ parts of dead cadaver animals rotting in a morgue/zoo and piecing them together to ultimately make a huge man 'Alive' called 'prometheus' (later on in the film, their ultimate goal).

Then comes the day where it is creation of Prometheus, the huge man/hunk of flesh using the thunder to animate it, it works but as we know it turns out to be a soul-less monstrosity that is hellbent on killing everything. Mr.Frankenstein then understands his Creations are soulless and thus pointless...A great film...I was surprised there was such a great chemistry between Mr.Frankenstein and Igor...James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe are absolutely Great ! Mr.McAvoy does an incredible acting job, he's tempestuous and sure of himself, he trusts Igor with his life, he exudes great authority, genie, border-insanity and knowledge; Mr.Radcliffe does a nice job as the timid circus crooked clown and into a young man straight up who wants to create something in his life. The woman is also great. The British agent too, also, Mr.Frankenstein's rich young British rival (called Finnegan, Freddie Fox) that offers him to make Prometheus in his castle on a beach coast (that kills Igor by throwing him in the water to drown, but Igor survives), is also great. The CG VFX and prosthetic are incredible such as the monkey creature and Prometheus himself; the 19th century London sets are truly beautiful and beautifully constructed, live or CG set extensions. This is a very high production/budget value film and it show immensely. We even have a brief visit from Mr.Frankenstein's Father (the incredible actor Charles Dance) whom scolds him/slaps him by telling him he brings shame to the family name 'Frankenstein' for creating these science flesh monsters alive and that he wasted his life now...All in all, a great movie that really surprised me, it's a touching story about wanting to accomplish your dreams and accomplishing the impossible (bringing a deal animal/carcass to life, making life out of death), it's a story of deep friendship (Mr.Frankenstein and Igor), and love (Igor and the beautiful intelligent acrobat woman whom tells him he must be careful and watch out for the missteps of Mr.Frankenstein and stand up to him if he's wrong/even if he is his friend, or that Mr.Frankenstein saved his life by liberating him from the freak-show circus (when Igor was trapped there)). Igor knows that and at a certain point (when both are seeked out by the police as outlaws) he has no choice but abandoned Mr.Frankenstein...but he comes back to save him at the castle from doing Prometheus. I really don't understand the very poor rating, it deserved so much more than 6.0...Great film, absolutely loved it ! : 9 out of 10."
