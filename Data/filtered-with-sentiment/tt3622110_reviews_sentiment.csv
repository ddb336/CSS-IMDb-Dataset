" I actually really liked it
",0.4754,0.7219,2021-01-27 00:00:00,8,I was really impressed with how decent this movie turned out to be it is really creepy. If you're into horror movies I highly recommend giving it a try!!!

" Don't bother knocking.
",0.2584,-0.1695,2020-12-13 00:00:00,4,It's not worth the watch. Just watch it if you have absolutely nothing else to watch.
" Much Jumpscares I loved it
",0.5994,0.6426,2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"Want to get Scared ? Don't Knock Twice will help.
Here are a lot of review that nothing is new in the movie.But why you watch a horror movie ? TO GET SCARED, which this movie successfully did.Don't Knock Twice gives you chills throughout the film. The movie is FULL OF JUMPSCARES. Story is decent. You will not get bored. Actors are all superb specially Katee Sackoff. The special effects are good. Direction is very good. Everything is good.Don't go with the other review. WATCH THE FILM and DECIDE YOURSELF whether it was good enough to scare you.The movie is a lot more scary than many mainstream horror movies. 10 out of 10 from me. :)"
" Ouuch!! What a Trainwreck
",0.0,-0.9432,2020-08-18 00:00:00,2,"Gahh where do you even begin. They put all the cliche horror elements in one movie and tried to end it with a clever twist that derailed right off the screen and crashed into a jumbled production mess. This movie was dumb, the acting is horrible, the writing is all over the place. My wife and I seriously don't know what we just finished watching. We both felt a numb emptiness in our head for about 2-3 minutes after it was over attempting to articulate the garbage we just watched. Why would IFC support this!?"
" They shouldn't have even knocked once....
",0.0,0.4033,2020-08-18 00:00:00,2,"This is by far one of the most pointless movies I have ever seen. Over the top nothingness. I wanted to like it, the premise seemed like it could develop into something. It seemed like it took parts of other horror movies and tried to mash them all in this one movie. The character development was very poor and scattered. I personally did not like any part of this movie."
" Don't watch twice

" Awful movie with equally awful implications
",-0.7184,-0.9873,2020-08-04 00:00:00,1,"I watched this to wind down for bed. Probably not the best idea in hindsight. Not because it's a horror movie (it's REALLY not scary), but because it's just awful.It's got no sense of structure, every moment that's supposed to come off as ""heartwarming"" is just incredibly unearned (at best. More on that below), the characters act like morons and the movie keeps trying to be artsy and failing miserably, to the point where a couple of times, I actually had trouble following it in places. And the kicker?Okay, so the movie's about a girl being haunted and she moves back in with her mother, who put her into a children's home years ago. There's a scene where the social worker is visiting for the usual ""check in"" visit where the ghost/demon/whatever-I-don't-care wrecks some stuff and it looks like the girl did it. The mother actually hisses ""What is WRONG with you?"" at her daughter, and yet the social worker doesn't IMMEDIATELY get the kid out of there. Worse still, the next scene is the mother calling social services and is clearly thinking about giving her daughter up again, and we're supposed to be happy that she doesn't. No, I'm sorry, if you scream at your daughter for acting out when she has a list of reasons for resenting you that's as long as my arm, you are unfit as a parent and don't get to have the high ground in any capacity. And then she has the audacity to say that she loves her daughter in order to keep her from rightfully leaving. While unpacking her daughter's bag, no less. Abusive behaviour hiding behind the ""they're family, so they need to stick together"" is always disgusting.Basically, save yourself 90 minutes and don't bother with this trainwreck of a film. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, and I watch a LOT of bad movies."

" Could've Been Better
",0.4404,0.4069,2020-04-30 00:00:00,4,"This 2016 horror film stars Katee Sackhoff and Lucy Boynton.
Sackhoff (Halloween Resurrection) plays Jess, a sculptor who tries to repair her relationship with her rebellious daughter, Chloe (Boynton). Soon, Chloe is haunted by the evil spirit of a witch after knocking on her door twice. Chloe seeks help from Jess who also starts having nightmares and visions. This starts off ok with potential, but could've been better. There are some creepy moments, the score is good and both women aren't bad in it.
If you're into supernatural horror, give this a try."
" Meh
",-0.0772,-0.3182,2020-04-10 00:00:00,3,"This movie tried to get the scares through and occasionally it may land, but slow narrative make this movie seem drawn out with little content.

" Barely worth a 1 time watch.
",0.1548,0.6369,2020-04-10 00:00:00,4,"This was a rather slow movie and feels like it dragged on. Acting was alright and story was okay, though this movie was more for background noise if anything. Didn't grab my attention until the end."
" Przepraszam it's a no from me
",-0.296,-0.8733,2020-04-08 00:00:00,4,"The mediocre rating on this film is pretty accurate. It's pretty generic and doesn't have much to offer that hasn't already been done and seen before. The biggest disappointment was the lack of any feeling or emotional attachment for the leading characters. While watching you just don't feel much connection or empathy for either Jess or Chloe. While some characters disappear during the film and seem to be forgotten about by everyone fairly quickly and then they are almost never mentioned again.There is an amusing sense while watching these types of films which at the end of the day take away a lot of believability to the story as the whole. And that is why the spirit itself doesn't just kill or possess it's victims. But rather it seems to want to scare and intimidate them and then disappear at the presence of another character. While then only wanting to reappear when no one else is around and the person is at their most vulnerable. That being said it tries to deliver a couple of creepy moments with the materialisation of the witch in confined uncomfortable spots. Unfortunately these moments in the film were few and far between.There were two scenes which that made me cringe. But as a whole the movie didn't have me on the edge of my seat and instead left me slightly confused with the many minor plot holes and linear storytelling. Props to Pooneh (Tira) who I believe played the most interesting character, it was just a shame for her lack of screen time. I would recommend you look elsewhere however it you want to see better films in this genre like Insidious or Candyman.4/10"
" Very effective horror ...
",-0.1494,-0.6108,2020-03-04 00:00:00,8,"This is a very effective horror film involving a sculptor who attempts to rebuild a relationship with her estranged daughter. While Jess (Katee Sackhoff) has become fairly successful in her field, Chloe (Lucy Boynton) is mischievous, occasionally bratty and appears to have attracted the attention of a demon.Having got that plot detail out of the way, we are then treated to some scary set-pieces, some of which are familiar from other similar horror projects, and others which are more impressive on their own merits. While the plot itself isn't advanced much during this time, other than to cast doubt on who exactly the true villain is, it is enormous fun to sit back and let Director Caradog James's effectively orchestrated chills do their work.The pay-off however, is that there isn't one. We find out what the entity isn't, but we don't find out what it is. Not that films, horror in particular, need to have every plot detail tidied up by the close - sometimes only having suggestions as to the perpetrator of evil is enough. It is all down to individual opinion, and mine is that 'Don't Knock Twice' is a very effective, well played and beautifully written horror venture. My score is 8 out of 10."
" Don't listen to the haters.
",-0.4939,0.2714,2020-02-12 00:00:00,9,"This movie is spooky, scary, twisty, and engrossing. All the actors are believable. The effects are on point. The story is original. Definitely watch this one!"
" Ad hoc version of urban myth horror is interesting, and well acted
",0.0258,-0.9897,2020-01-20 00:00:00,6,"Since 2016 there have been many notable urban myth movies, and, understandably, all of them do better than Don't Knock Twice. For its day however, this movie would have been alright, with at least a scare or two, some pretty good witch-in-the-shadows effects, and a liberal dose of what-really-happened intrigue. The actors, Katee Sackhoff, Lucy Boynton, and Richard Mylan, are all very good and raise the bar a little, but they all struggle against a plot that hasn't been well thought out and is basically a series of vignettes with dubious connections. At one point, for example, a girl is abducted suddenly from the street via a witch controlled underground sewer 'door', which, although certainly an original idea, is slightly odd. This is followed by the mother desperately attempting to follow, into a strange forest scene that doesn't seem to be connected to anything, and then a labyrinth of underground tunnels, again seeming odd and out of place in context to the rest of the story so far. These scenes shake off the standard creepy house theme that was dominating beforehand. Mind you, there are two creepy houses connected to the story. It's all very ad hoc to my mind, so much so I found the movie to be interesting rather than scary. The story also suffers from thin believability, the mother jumping to a conclusion of someone's guilt on no real evidence but rather on her hyper-interpretation of means and motive. She turns out to be wrong, crucial to the ending, which is hardly original and something often seen in horror movies. Basically it's just not solid enough for me to believe it. There's another scene where the daughter suddenly runs off. This was really odd, because it meant leaving her mother whom is the only other person whom knows the threat she's under and is in a position to help her. This all leads to another dramatic scene back at the orphanage (where the daughter ran to). Again, ad hoc. The soundtrack was good and at times really heightened the tension. There was plenty of tension. The filming standard is good, with at least a few classic horror images, and it's worth watching the movie for that and the performance of Katee Sackhoff, particularly if you love horror. Don't Knock Twice is not a bad movie, but it is another example of an idea that has been rushed into production before the kinks have been properly ironed out. 6/10 from me."

There are scenes, that are long enough with a good music on background that really raise the tension and make you easy to be scared if a jumpscare appear.Again, is the type of horror that some good stuff happen for a few minutes near the ending, but were a few good minutes, can't be a hater.
A little plot twist, a sudden ending ... they kind of left the movie unfinished."

Overal there is a dark and evil ambiance throughout the entire movie. That is mostly due to a good soundtrack, that definitely adds to the suspense, but also due to some nice visual effects. The story itself is a bit bland but not the worse I've seen in this genre. The acting isn't bad, nice sound and visual, and there is a twist to it, to me that's enough to be entertained."

" Not without flaws, but an effective low budget horror film
",-0.5499,0.2838,2019-06-18 00:00:00,7,"For what appears to be a relatively low-budget horror film, I found this enjoyable/scary enough to keep me interested. The ideas and plot, while not all original, are good, the pacing is good, and many of the scenes are very well lit and filmed, with obviously a lot of talent and thought going into them.It's easy to find flaws - the sometimes ill-judged score, occasional reliance on horror cliches, uneven acting (although Boynton and Sackhoff are fine), and some scenes that don't follow smoothly from previous scenes, but it is still effective.With so many middling, cliched horror films around, despite its faults this one rose above the masses for me, and I'd like to see James return to the horror genre in the future, hopefully with a bigger budget."

After knocking on a house filled to the brim of fear because of an urban legend, a young woman seeks refuge in her mother's household from a supernatural entity, slowly realizing it followed her.
This film brews with satisfactory lore and a couple twists and turns but never seemed to satisfy my need of a great down to earth movie. This movie is watchable and okay, some mild jumpscares scattered about. There is an emotional scene that was building up, until it was annoyingly crushed from the supernatural. This movie is a slow brewing cup of red tea that hasn't enough caffeine to wake you up.
I would buy this film and recommend it to those who love IFC but just remember that it's story may be good but the pacing is slow."

" Just when the ending seemed to...

But instead of being clever about it they took it in a direction that wasn't clever and left questions. Nothing wrong with questions left in a horror movie, but it really needs to be properly set up so we can make reasonable guesses as to what happened when they stopped short of giving us the final scene. And that - well, why not stop the Exorcist before the priest throws himself out the window? We know why."
" Ridiculous
",-0.3612,-0.7224,2019-02-17 00:00:00,2,"I love sci-fi, fantasy and horror. Especially the ""b"" movies which most people hate on with low ratings and spittle. Anyhoo... this one does not deserve the 5.1 rating it currently has, not even the 4.0+ l often enjoy when others don't. It's definitely a 2.0 and that's just for effort.Predictability is fine as long as it is creatively presented. This is not. Also, everyone knocks twice. And they are always knocking. I don't care if you ""don't knock twice"" for the witch, but everyone knows it is odd to only knock twice when knocking at a door. Most people knock three times, some even more. But knocking only twice is rare, and never is it everyone in the world all the time.That got truly obnoxious. Further, the dialogue was stiff and unbelievable. If you don't want to care about any of the characters, this is for you. The only character which got my sympathy was the witch. Seriously. She was quite troubled and needed an empathetic friend."

",0.1967,-0.9729,2019-02-17 00:00:00,5,"As others have written, this movie does atmosphere really well, and I enjoyed that a lot. I'm not usually a fan of Katie Sackhoff but loved her performance in this. Lucy Boynton's bratty teenager role got old and she looked stunned for most of the movie, but I got past it. It had some good jump scares and some unnecessary and stupid ones, but I got past them, too. I liked the movie overall, my biggest complaint with it being the ending.Brief synopsis in my words: An old woman accused of abducting children is hounded by a young girl and her friend and an investigating cop and eventually kills herself. Her ghost comes back for revenge after the girl and her friend knock on the door of the house the old woman used to live in, like they used to to hound her.A good, old haunted house with a ghost story, right? That would have been fine by me, but then it tries to get a little too clever and attempts one twist too many and blows it - in my opinion. It also seemed like a last minute, cheap attempt to leave it open for an obvious sequel.Okay, now for some spoilers... Apparently the villain wasn't a vengeful ghost it was a demon. Wait, no, it was a child abductor AND a ghost AND a demon. Wait, no, it was some kind of witch or something working with or for the demon or something. And the old woman was innocent. She was being controlled by the demon. Wait, no, it might have been somebody else. Wait, no, it wasn't them after all, it was the old lady but now a new lady has taken her place? Oh, and the knocking twice - that doesn't mean anything after all. Wait, what? But that's the title of the movie!Y'know what? I'm not sure anymore and don't care. They had a good old ghost story going and lost it somewhere along the way. Not cool. But while I shook my head at the ending, I didn't hate this. It's still a 5 out of 10 for me just for the atmosphere and genuine creepiness of it."

As for this movie, I would avoid wasting your time."
" Formulaic but frightening!
",-0.68,0.5922,2019-02-13 00:00:00,7,"While I will say that there are quite an abundance of horror tropes in this move, (monster in the mirror, stepping on random nail, cheap fake-out jumpscares, cheap real jumpscares.. just to name a few), this didn't stop the movie from building a grand amount of suspense in several moments. Instead of opting for the hidden-monster of lots of demon-centric films of this type, this film does not spare any of the graphic details of it's main monster, and this is totally fine BECAUSE IT IS TERRIFYING! The plot isn't half bad either, I personally didn't see the plot twist ending coming, however I am sure it certainly could have been predicted by someone who is more finely tuned to the types of films.I highly recommend watching this film if you want something that isn't too long and is almost guaranteed to scare you."

" Somehow suspenseful in the first half l but still to cliche to be fresh..
",0.0,-0.0644,2018-09-09 00:00:00,5,"Lovely visuals and amazing sound effects. 
First half very suspenseful. The story of the mother and her daughter was just misleading. You don't really get to find a connection between them besides they're both terribly stupid but there is also no really character development. Feels like the writer didn't really know if he wanted to make a drama or horror movie.Acting was acceptable I guess. Most of the time a little bit over the edge. Just when I thought the second half is going to be very interesting about finding out who took Michael and suspenseful, it turned out to be, as well as every other horror movie out there, more action-packed than horror. The 'monster' or whatever they called it in the movie was laughable towards the end. 
It also turned out to be a little bit too supernatural with creating a whole new dimension like the cave to spice up the setting. Too much. Way too much. The end was quite shocking tbh. I did not see it coming. However the movie was too cliche with ok acting. 
 
Barely made it to 5 stars. More like 4.5"
" Trying way too hard
",-0.1027,-0.8895,2018-08-31 00:00:00,4,"If you want to watch a horror movie without actually investing too much of a thought to it or don't want much - just a few scares with a so-so plot, then go ahead and watch Don't Knock Twice.But; if you want a GOOD horror movie with suspense and building up the tension until you're about to crawl all over the walls, then just skip this.Don't Knock Twice makes it absolutely clear from the very first few minutes of the film; it tries way too hard to be scary. So it relies to jump scares, shadows in the dark corners, blood, scary masks and hands reaching out from whatever. These effects would be absolutely fine when scattered just right, but when they're all mushed together and presented within the first 20 minutes in, they lose their power. Sadly, this is something the writers and/or director didn't realize, and so they just start with full steam when you haven't even got the chance to get to know the people you're supposed to relate with.The acting varies greatly. Katee Sackhoff, who plays the mother, is okay, but Lucy Boynton playing the daughter is far from believable. I do understand that a role of a teenager with a difficult past is a challenging role.So in conclusion; lots of jumpscares and clichÃ©s, and you can forget about any relateable main characters, since there isn't one. But if you tune your brain to low setting, grab a bowl of popcorn and just go with it, it's bearable."

So shocking would not be an attribute I would attach to the movie (except from some jump scares).Of course this may be the only reason you tuned in, in the first place. So if that's the case enjoy the ride, do not think about logical errors or irrational behaviour and it will be fine."

Twice to raise her from the dead.
If you knock her door, she still hears it.
Sooner or later she comes knockin' for you.""The movie ""Don't knock twice"" should be a must watch for the mischiefs who like to play ""Ding Dong Ditch"". Maybe this frightening legend will make them think twice the next time before they do that again. Nowadays, a horror film has to be fairly original to get noticed, because you can't keep up with the number of releases. The ""Ding Dong Ditch"" trick is an interesting approach. And at the same time there's the dramatic part about the shaky relationship between a mother and daughter. Apparently, the haunting witch doesn't only scares those brats but she's also good in patching up a bad mother-daughter relationship.All hell breaks loose after Chloe (Lucy Boynton) receives a visit from her mother Jess (Katee Sackhoff) in the orphanage, where she was placed years ago. And this because of her mother's persistent addiction which made her unable to care for her daughter. It's not surprising that this confrontation goes terribly wrong, after which her daughter takes off with her boyfriend. They end up at the house of Mary Aminov, an old woman who commited suicide because she was fed up with the banging on her front door. And she planned to visit those who torment her again in the future, as an evil spirit. And what a surprise. The two carefree teenagers, who know the legend but don't really believe in it, knock on the door. And before you know it, you'll jump up when that ugly witch sneaks out of some dark corner, after which Chloe's friend suddenly disappears. That would seem an appropriate time for Chloe to knock on her mother's door (with no consequences). And this is the beginning of a joint venture to find a solution to get rid of the curse that rests on Chloe.Even though this movie contains a bunch of horror clichÃ©s that have been used in several films already, I thought it was scary and creepy enough. There are parts that remind you of the innumerable films about a possessed house with creepy sounds, threatening shadows and dark corners. There's the diabolical spirit that controls the lights in a corridor (the same way as in ""Lights out""), makes blood appear in cups of soup and creates hallucinations. And the creature that came out of the shadows immediately reminded me of the nasty demon in ""Mama"". No wonder, because it was the same person, Javier Botet, who gave shape to this lugubrious, frightening creature.Some may think that the two completely different storylines used in this film, don't really fit together. Personally, I thought it was a successful experiment. Bringing in an unsolved murder case, felt a bit too forced. And if that's not enough, you'll be surprised in the end. ""Don't knock twice"" effortlessly exceeds the average. It's scarier and creepier than you would think. And the protagonists played in an excellent way. Maybe the emotional part was a bit exaggerated. But the fear they showed at certain moments, just seemed real. For Katee Sackhoff no problem, because she already had to go up against a supernatural phenomena in ""Oculus"". And the unknown Lucy Boynton (whom I didn't recognize from ""Murder on the Orient Express"") produced quite some decibels while screaming. Well, this movie won't win a prize for originality. But are planning a horror movie night? This'll fit perfectly."
" derivative

Chloe and her friend Danny visit a nearby abandoned house. Former occupant Mary committed suicide after supposedly killing Chloe's friend Michael. The rule is to knock twice. Once to wake up from her bed and twice to raise her from the dead. They both knock and ditch. Danny gets haunted by a demonic spirit and is killed. Chloe is next.This is derivative of so many other horrors and it's inferior in many ways. There is nothing new and not much of it is done well. The characters are sculpted poorly. It's hard to feel for the relationship when there is so little invested. The characters have no depth. The movie takes us to a haunted house but we don't get to go in right away. Honestly, there's an easy road to a solid indie horror. It's a simple haunted house horror if the two young people go inside. Jess can then come to Chloe's rescue. It shouldn't be that hard but the movie is intend on making it that hard. It becomes a confusing road to travel which wraps up with an explanation. I guess the plot works but it's not compelling as it unfolds. As an aside, there is a lack of specificity to the setting which is needed. That's where more background on American Jess would help with the British setting. This is a lot of nothing and I wanted good things for Starbuck."
" A Crooked Stairs Review (Don't Knock Twice)
",0.0,0.9819,2018-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Director: Caradog JamesWell, let's get down to it then. Being an avid horror fan for manys a year now, I would consider myself fairly clued up on current and upcoming releases within the genre. It was then more than a bit of a mystery how this flick somehow managed to slip through the net until I found out about its existence this very week! Needless to say, it went straight to the top of the must watch pile...BASIC PLOT: A woman tries to regain custody of her teenage daughter after years spent apart. The daughter however has struggles of her own, with close friends vanishing simingly at the hands of an old urban legend surrounding a sinister house nearby. As things escalate and apparitions become more violent, can the estranged family finally put the past behind them to try and save their future?REVIEW: This is a tough one. I can easily see why the internet is awash with such mixed reviews and agitated confusion regarding the movie. A simple explanation for this is no doubt because of the promise the film holds in its premise. A straight forward storyline to be sure, witches and curses a plenty, but don't we all love that in horror when it's done right? The film jumps straight into it and although it can be stated that it perhaps suffers from a lack of character development (particularly in the early stages), it did also surprise me how quickly it gets down to the initial scares. My hopes weren't all that high in the 'scare' department going into this one, but absolute credit where it's due, there were indeed some unnerving scenes scattered throughout which almost called for the flip of a light switch! The cinematography is what really drives this piece however. The camera work and shot choice help to propel the overall tone of the film, keeping things very bleak and murky but with a beautiful depth and clarity also. The acting of the 2 leading ladies is to be commended also. Both Katee Sackhoff & Lucy Boynton do their upmost to sweat out anxiety and fear for the full 93mins that the movie plays out, and indeed without these convincing performances playing off each other, the movie would have been a sure bust. It is fair to say then that the real unraveling of Don't Knock Twice is in its screenplay. It's all there-a scary urban legend, heavy and dark cinematography to back it up and strong leading actresses to deliver the characters, but when the initial story and dialogue that's drafted is mediocre at best and at worst bogged down by countless plotholes and underdeveloped characters, then the amount that an audience truly invests in the story and it's characters fates will always suffer. The ending itself is testament enough, with what should have been a thrilling and indeed terrifying conclusion instead playing out as what felt more like a rushed half-explained brush off.VERDICT:: Beautiful visuals, strong acting, a good creepy musical score throughout and a few genuinely disturbing moments help keep an underdeveloped and messy plot afloat. Well worth a watch for a fan of the genre, just don't expect the world. (6/10)"

So the story has been done to death, but it's the delivery that impresses me more then anything, it's actually quite slick, very well made, and done in a way keeps your attention. It is incredibly moody, very atmospheric and features a fantastic musical score. Perhaps because it was made on a slightly smaller scale adds to the production, they don't try to push for too much in terms of special effects, but what they have work well. Katee Sackhoff is very good, very fitting for her complex character'a part, the supporting cast are all great too. I wouldn't say it's one for fans of extreme horror and gore, but for a supernatural horror made in Wales it scores very highly. 7/10"

One of the main selling points for this one is the fact that it manages to exploit a rather common trope in the genre pretty effectively. Even though the myth about the titular with isn't all that original, the fact that it manages to tie into it pretty effectively with some chilling moments is really fun and brings about some effective scenes. The initial opening attack in the apartment with the witch appearing in the hallway before featuring the attack in the room itself leads to a fine sequence shown through the monitor, followed up immediately with the stellar ambush in the kitchen which is exceptionally eerie alongside the fine sequences showing the adjustment of their living situation where her tools are getting damaged despite her proclamations of innocence all have a nice vibe to them. Basing these type of encounters along the lines of being unsure of how truthful she's being based on their strained relationship adds a nice tone to their plight as that leads into the more intense moments at the end where they come face-to-face with the creature. Given that this leads to the final battle at the witch's lair that gives this some solid moments. While there's plenty to like with these features, it does have some minor problems overall as well. The main issue with this one is the ludicrous notion of not believing the daughter's stories simply so that they can come together in the end to battle the witch. Some of the events in question here, from the early warnings of how they played around with the legend, the models' freakout around her to the destroyed art studio they come to where a bloodied warning message is left behind, it all seems a little unreasonable that they don't detect anything is going on around her as long as they do since this doesn't make them seem like good people that come around at the end. Instead, it just simply paints them as foolish for not recognizing anything out of the ordinary and as unnecessary fodder for the reconciliation to be had. The other issue here is the overtly useless subplot introduced here about the tormented history of the main witch as it's cliched, easy and doesn't inspire any addition fear into the creature than what would already have been the case being a typical witch on a rampage. It really tends to demystify the creature with this prototypical setup, and overall these here really are what hold it back.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Language."

The story is about a house cursed by the suicide of the female occupant; brave souls can knock twice on the door if they wish to find themselves haunted by her spirit. I quite liked the back story here, although the ghost itself is a direct copy of the one found in THE GRUDGE and not nearly as scary."

So when someone writes, for a film, we expect something fresh, not refresh or repetition.It was a common platform. That's about a local legend. When a teen couple set to test one of the stories they have heard, it puts them in an extreme position. Later the girl joins her mother who had just returned to the town to win her back. Now they both try to escape from the supernatural threat. How much they succeed and the rest of the tale follows with a twist before the end.The same initiation, build up and conclusion as any horror film. Watchable film, but not any good.

In such a place, Don't Knock Twice might be heralded as groundbreaking. In this world, however, it's just another ho-hum cookie cutter creep-fest, inspired by the likes of Ringu and The Grudge, featuring a malevolent supernatural entity with long straggly hair. Put simply, we've seen it all before (and done much better).Katee Sackhoff plays troubled artist Jess, whose daughter Chloe (Lucy Boynton) has spent much of her life in care thanks to her mother's drug problems. Now, happily married and drug-free, Jess is at long last attempting to reconnect with her daughter, but finds doing so just a little difficult due to an angry ghost/demon that is hellbent on killing Chloe because she had the temerity to knock on the door of a haunted house.To start with, director Caradog W. James is content to churn out the expected brooding atmospherics and mechanical scares, but when the script delves into the whys and wherefores of the unwanted supernatural occurrences, which revolve around the unsolved disappearance of a young boy, matters become extremely convoluted, culminating in a daft twist ending (clue: never trust an Eastern European)."

But I imagine if I did make one I would want to do something different, something unique, something to stand out. So many films today just seem happy to do the bare minimum and turn it in. Whether that's down to film makers being completely out of ideas, or the fact that pretty much any old thing will be green-lit these days, I'm not sure. What I do know though is that high quality products coming out of Hollywood are a dying thing. 'Don't Knock Twice' is a prime example of this. The story actually has some potential to be both a fun ride and also scary. As it turned out it's neither.Firstly, the characters are unbearable bland. There are two women the film focuses on and each is incredibly unlikable. The film goes for an extremely dark tone, to the point of (if I remember correctly) not a single effort at a joke throughout the entire movie. Secondly, the scares simply don't work. This is partly because we don't care about any of the character's fates anyway, and partly because there's nothing original or creative in any way apparent. Every jump scare can be predicted a mile away and everything else is just run-of-the-mill.The only redeeming quality the film has is its ending. The ending was good. It was creative and fun. However all that did was make me think why can't the film start from here? From here on is the point I want to see of the film. Instead it simply ends and that's that. 'Don't Knock Twice' is not a film I will be recommending to friends."
" Not top quality, but fun to watch!
",0.6647,0.9914,2017-07-12 00:00:00,6,"As most of us sadly know, despite its growing popularity Horror is not a genre known for neither masterpieces nor blockbusters. Most films of the genre are cookie-cutter patterns following the same unwritten yet repeatedly utilized set of rules concerning the plot, the characters and even the specific scenes, while offering very little innovation or originality. Don't Knock Twice is another example of this phenomenon, but one well made.First, we have the exposition, involving a tragedy or post-trauma, in this case a teenager growing up in a foster home after her drug addict mother gave her up in order to spare her. Now reformed, the mother wishes to try and win back her daughter's love, with the support of her loving second husband. Not surprisingly, the teenager is bitter and cold, bearing a very legitimate grudge, but turns to her mother's protection when all else fails. In time, the mother learns that the supernatural demonic entity haunting her daughter is far from being imaginary, and the two begin their battle for survival, using advice given by the mother's friend who's an expert in superstition and witchcraft. Sounds familiar? Indeed, I'm certain most of you can think of two or three similar plots with little effort.The original bit is actually very nice in my opinion, although the film failed to capitalize on it (and in a way didn't even try). The demon, awoken as a result of kids' disregard of an urban legend, needs to enter through a door in order to seize its prey. Contrary to basic instincts - those hoping to fend off the demon must avoid closed doors of any kind. This feature of the story receives very little screen time, which is unfortunate, as it is the one display of originality and creative innovative thought. Huge potential unfulfilled.The acting is right on the spot, especially by the main mother and daughter duo (Katee Sackhoff as mother Jess and Lucy Boynton as daughter Chloe). Sackhoff's acting is particularly impressive, especially her nonverbal acting. Her body language and facial expressions, her way of displaying emotions, everything is as authentic as can be. I had to actively remind myself that she was an actress playing a role. Boynton wasn't as impressive, but the gap was really small. Imaging a teenage daughter's behavior towards her estranged mother after years of growing up with child services - and you've imagined Boynton's acting. Excellent job by director Caradog W. James in shaping these characters!In addition, I for one think the soundtrack is excellent, perceived by me as a delicate combination of Slasher soundtracks like Friday the 13th, and supernatural Ghost Stories like Insidious. Many such soundtrack are great and serve their purpose accurately, but this one felt new.All in all, Don't Knock Twice is a mediocre horror story well presented on screen. Despote its obvious (and oftentimes frustrating) shortcomings (especially screenplay-wise) - the jump- scares (though a cheap trick) are well used, the eerie haunting scenes are terrifying, and the film offers a fun and worthy Horror experience."

Lucy Boynton (from NETFLIX's I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House) as her rebellious and estranged teenage daughter. The opens up as Jess and her husband Ben played by Wales native, Richard Mylan are working on rekindling Jess' relationship with her troubled young teenage daughter, Chloe. After another unsuccessful attempt, the film follows Chloe's teenage angst with her boyfriend Danny as they unknowingly awaken a daemonic force by playing a childhood game.This escalates a series of disturbing events which lead to Chloe coming back into Jess' life.

I assure you the creature actor in this film will disturb you like no other. The BABA YAGA is played by none other than the amazing Javier Botet (known for IT, The Conjuring 2, The REC Series, Mama & many more!!)The story originates from real life urban legend which to my knowledge has never been done before in cinematic form. This IFC film is something quite new and incorporates a evil as old as time. Not many films have used the BABA YAGA as a antagonist. This film shows the evil that is exactly that, but without giving too much away. Too many horror films seem to go for showing the creature full on to the audience leaving NOTHING to the imagination. This UK film understands the complexity and the simplicity of going just far enough for the target audience, so when the scares kick in, they are appreciated and used to their full extent.If you haven't seen this film, I recommend you add this film to your collection. IFC has another great horror film on their hands and Caradog James has brought to life another great horror icon."
" Beware, you're in for a scare.
",-0.4939,0.9939,2017-06-14 00:00:00,10,"I had seen the cover of this movie as a related item on a few horror films and thought the plot was intriguing. Then I saw the Blu Ray was on sale at Walmart, which is actually interesting because it was accidentally stocked two months ahead of its release date. But I didn't complain as I took it home ready for what I was hoping would be a good spooky horror movie night. I wasn't disappointed. Despite the negative reviews, this ended up being one of the better horror treats from IFC Midnight and one of the best overall horror films in recent memory. -Plot- Chloe is somewhat estranged from her ex-addict mother Jess for the beginning of her life. But now a more stable and wealthy Jess wants to reconnect with her daughter. But before happily ever after could happen, Chloe and a friend had gone to a local neighborhood house where urban legend says a vengeful witch resides. The legend states that if you knock on her door twice, she will come and take you to her world. Well, they knocked twice. That is just the basic plot that sums up the first 5 minutes. Its a typical genre plot, but it is done surprisingly well. I am appalled by the negative scores. This is better than your average scary movie. The mythos is very creepy. The acting is above average for the genre and budget. The directing and cinematography contain some beautiful and terrifying imagery. The musical score is an instant horror classic. The sound design altogether is intense. The trailer for this surprisingly doesn't give away even half of the scares so even seeing it beforehand wont ruin any of it. But the trailer doesn't help its case either. There are plenty of jump scares that will truly get to you. Some might call them lazy, but their just nit picky. The entity of the witch is truly horrifying and will have you reaching for a blanket or light switch in all of its on screen moments. The actor playing the witch entity is the same that played the scary ""mama"" entity from Mama and the emaciated demon at the end of REC, so you know you're in for some scary imagery with this guy. The mythos of the movie does get a little over indulgent toward the end, but it still works well, despite a somewhat rushed ending and typical horror movie ""bad logic"" by some characters. Id compare some of the scary moments to ""Lights Out"" and even one early sighting of the witch to the Nun painting scene in ""The Conjuring 2"". I am surprised this didn't get a nationwide theatrical release as its production value is pretty nice looking compared to nationwide horror craps like Bye Bye Man. I attribute its absence from cinemas to its lack of a recognizable star. Which is unfortunate since I would have loved to experience this on the big screen. But that's what makes the horror genre so special. Even little gems like this that are ignored by mainstream media can end up being big cult classics and I believe this is a candidate. I am a horror junky and don't scare that easily anymore, but the entity of the witch really got to me. I really found myself inching toward the light switch and looking to see if something was behind me multiple times. One of the few films in a long time that I had trouble watching in the dark entirely during my first viewing. I would even go as far as to say this is a more accessible and fast paced take on A24s period horror ""The Witch"". I think the negative reviews will surely get lost in praise as this finds its audience. I gave it a 10/10 to do my small part in helping its score improve, but my real grade would be maybe a 8.5/10. Its truly much better than the trailer suggest and definitely better than the negative reviews say. If you want a good fright night with a lover or friends, or even alone, then this is a perfect choice. If you liked ""Lights Out"" or ""The Conjuring"" style horror then beware you're in for a scare. Just make sure its dark and the volume is high. I'm adding this to my go to Halloween season movie playlist."

Would you do that?2, boyfriend is missing, girlfriend is not in sadness or doesn't even have any emotions, gone is gone, I don't care, she seems. 3, mother was locked from outside the house, she tried so hard to break the door fighting the supernatural force, she saw her daughter being dragged by the force, when everything calms down, she just told her daughter calmly that there is no one in the house. Are you stupid? You thought it was the wind or something?4, in the park her daughter just suddenly turned around and left the mother without saying anything, and the mother saw her gone and didn't feel anything, she didn't do anything either. The next day she went to the school to pick her daughter up and her daughter thanked her for coming here. What is this? Hide and seek game?5, Her daughter suddenly disappeared on the street, the mother again didn't express any emotion, instead of looking for her anxiously, she calmly went to the ghost house, at night, without any flashlight, is this normal to do when your daughter is missing?6, the daughter thinks that the detective is a good man, but when he wants some help and is dying, the daughter is just looking at him calmly and doing nothing so he died! Later when they went home she said to her mom that she was thinking about the detective because he is the good guy, not the villain. Then why didn't you save him? Hahahaha! So stupid!7, The ghost likes playing hide and seek anytime a lot: she always appeared behind the actress, when actress turned around, ghost disappeared! In the tunnel scene, the ghost appeared behind the actress first then disappeared, then ghost appeared in front of the actress then disappeared again! You love hide and seek so much don't you?8, When the model said there's something wrong with your daughter, she might be haunted etc, the mom didn't express any emotion, and let the model leave and forgot about her completely. Don't you wanna ask why thoroughly?9, the witch can make the girl disappear on the street and appear in the ghost house; she can also make the mom disappear in police station by opening a door and letting her go into a wood, how convenient! Since she is so powerful, why bother hiding and running away from the witch?10, when mom enters the cave, her daughter just keeps silent and invisible, when mom comes near the cage, she suddenly appeared and scared her mom! What is this all about? Are you deaf? Can't you see your mom?11, when mom was in the forest, a boy ghost showed in front of her first and quickly disappeared, then showed up behind her telling her to follow. When the mom is lost, he appeared in another direction and ran away! What is this, hide and seek again? Can't you just take her hand and lead her the way?12, the boy slapped the cage so hard to scare the daughter, why? Can't you just say hello? Luckily he was eaten by the witch, and the daughter was frightened, then she hid in cage to scare her mom, then acted so brave and forgot she just saw a boy eaten. So laughable. 13, an old lady ghost is in the house, firstly she appeared behind the daughter, but when daughter turned around the ghost disappeared and showed up behind her again, the ghost did this again and again, so do you want to be seen or not? Then she suddenly appeared just in front of daughter's face and shouted ""run""! This ghost is really humorous and patient when playing!14, 15, 16, ......There are just so many laughable scenes and this is one of the worse and most stupid horror movies in history."
" Turned out to be a creepy surprise...
",0.0,0.9678,2017-04-25 00:00:00,6,"I do enjoy a good scare and a proper horror movie. I had not known about ""Don't Knock Twice"" prior to finding it by random luck. And being the horror aficionado that I am, I did of course sit down to watch it.And it turned out that ""Don't Knock Twice"" was genuinely creepy and had a very compelling and immense storyline. So the movie instantly reached out and pulled me in, and I enjoyed every moment of it.The storyline shown in ""Don't Knock Twice"" was unpredictable and director Caradog W. James was doing an excellent job of building up suspense and keeping the audience in the dark. And these build ups of drama and suspense were always well-finalized with fulfilling results as the climax of such a moment was reached.""Don't Knock Twice"" has some good acting performances by the cast hired to portray that various characters and roles throughout the movie. And it was nice to see some unfamiliar faces in a movie, and especially so when these actors and actresses were doing such good jobs at bringing the characters to life in the creepy story.The characters in the movie seemed fairly well-enough fleshed out, although you could of course always argue for characters needing more time on the screen to evolve and show more aspects of their personalities. But in overall, the character gallery in ""Don't Knock Twice"" was good and deep enough in terms of characteristics and personalities.Now, this is not the type of horror movie that depends much on having an impressive and in-your-face display of effects and such. No, this is more of a deep-rooting horror movie that plants a seed and lets it fester and slowly sink into your psyche. And for me, at least, it was a nice switch of approach to a horror movie. And I ended up being quite entertained by what director Caradog W. James mustered here.I will say that ""Don't Knock Twice"" was actually one of the more interesting and entertaining horror movies to make it to the screen in 2016. And if you haven't already seen the movie, I can highly recommend that you take the time to do so. I was genuinely entertained by it and it turned out to be a nice surprise of a movie."
" A horror film i'd make
",-0.5719,0.1109,2017-04-15 00:00:00,7,"After some minutes viewing, i thought this's a mediocre horror film. But i noticed how the film direction takes and i actually really like the screenplay though. Honestly this is the kind of horror film i'd make if i'm a filmmaker. That's why i tried to put myself in the character position. After 25 minutes, i got hooked in its simple plot. It's a bit boring in some unnecessary scenes. The horror presentation's good, i like especially the crying ghost scene. But some also don't scare at all, no goosebumps or scary feeling whatsoever. Background music's OK but not creepy enough. The character development's not presented so well. Acting's not bad, i care more Katee Sackhoff character more than the girl character which's rather annoying to watch. The ending's not good and satisfying enough. The execution's not good as the vision. Well it's a rather interesting horror flick to watch for me.7/10"
" Scary Enough
",-0.4939,0.9692,2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Caught a trailer for this at the beginning of last month & was excited to see it! The concept looked great & the premise sounded interesting! Though I was sadden to find that the 31st March release date came & went as I saw no sign of this film in cinemas let alone any word of it's release on the big screen anywhere. It was only until I found it was getting a Straight-To-DVD release. (Rolls eyes) But hell I was happy I was getting it, though not as happy as I wanted to see this film on the big screen. So anyway the film centres round a young girl named Chloe, a young woman who was given up for adoption 9 years prior because her mum was a junkie & couldn't look after her. The mum who has spent 9 years trying to get her life back on track gets the chance to reconcile with her daughter after nearly a decade, but the daughter wants nothing to do with her. It's then that Chloe & her boyfriend reawaken an demonic spirit via an urban legend that if you ""knock twice"" that you summon this demon & it will hunt you down. They do this & the demon kills Chloe's Boyfriend & is after Chloe who seeks refuge in her mums house only to find that the spirit has followed & so she & her mum try to figure out the deadly dark revelation of the towns urban legend.I found the film to be unique in it's own, right not extremely terrifying but great all the same. Though the title doesn't entirely make sense as nearly everyone ""knocks twice"" generally! But it had some scares here & there & some visually scary scenes, so it was alright there.The story had some good twists but was a bit confusing, not to mention that there were some confusing things about the film which I never got or seem to have holes in them. Unanswered questions & things which simply didn't add! It had some parts which made you think ""what the f*#k!?"" but maybe a re-watch is in order, or there's going to be Don't Knock Twice 2? But this was good nonetheless & a film I recommend to those who love horrors! 8/10"
" A Multi-faceted Horror Story
",-0.5719,0.7732,2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,"I was happily surprised by this film. When I watched the trailer and saw that Katee Sackhoff was starring I knew I had to see the full movie. I've been a fan of Sackhoff's for a while now, I particularly liked her portrayal of a deputy in the wonderful ""Longmire"". However, in this film her character isn't as strong, she's flawed and broken.Sackhoff plays Jess, a sculptress who has come back to England to put on a show and to get to know her daughter who she previously gave up to social services as she was a drug addict. Her daughter, Chloe played believingly by Lucy Boynton, is cautious and bluntly refuses to see her mother. She rethinks her actions when her best friend Danny, Jordan Bolger, disappears after they knock on the door of a haunted house.What makes this better than the average ghost story is the interwoven mystery of the ghost woman and a group of missing children. The twists and turns that the writers Mark Huckerby and Nick Ostler give the audience are well constructed to keep them guessing the outcome.The only thing I could have wished for were a few more scenes with mother and daughter, Jess and Chloe, getting to know each other. The ones in the movie feel a little too rushed to meet the runtime. This would have added greatly to the characters and the film.There was one irksome element in the film... the ""Two Knocks"". I know this is the hinge on which the story and its fear and tension balance, but really, who only knocks twice? I personally prefer ""Shave and a haircut, two bits"" rhythm knock. But without this component, the ""who's at the door"" tension would be feasible.in the first half, Caradog W James creates an eerie atmosphere and tension with some really nice camera shots and artistic segues between scenes. This, however, disappears for a more standard film work in the second half. If you like ghost stories and mysteries with plenty of twists in the plot I would recommend this film for your viewing pleasure. I don't think you'll be upset."
" Don't Watch Me Twice
",0.0,-0.6825,2017-04-04 00:00:00,3,"""Don't Knock Twice"" is your typical horror movie about kids who should know that urban legend usually turns out to be true (at least in horror movies).Every town has a local legend, like they always do in these horror movies, and town in ""Don't Knock Twice"". An old woman was believed to be a witch and she was accessed of kidnapping kids. After police found out about her crimes, she committed suicide and now everyone know knocks on her doors will cause her to come back from the grave and collect you for her master (demon\devil).An like in every horror movie, our teens don't believe in local legend and knock on old lady's door, and strange things start to happen. Lucy Boynton plays the lead girl, who is disturbed young girl. After her friend is murdered by the old witch, she goes to her estranged mother's house, believing she's safe there, but as it turns out, the witch has only started.""Don't Knock Twice"" had some solid ideas, but the script is filled with your clichÃ© ""cat-jumps-out-the-garbage-can"" scenes, which weren't well directed. There are few moments where director Caradog W. James could have taken advantage of the script, but failed to do so. There was no proper setup to any of the scares and even jump scares, leaving movie to be dry for those few minutes. There were few OK moments, which probably looked good on paper, but somehow they always missed that ""it"" factor to be creepy or scary.Katee Sackhoff plays the mother, but she's ""so-so"" in this movie, mostly because her character is clichÃ©d (she's artist who's also ex- junkie, need I say more?). Katee is trying to portray some emotions, but it's not her fault that her character is dry. And on the final note, ""Don't Knock Twice"" suffers from lack of focus. It's not sure where it wants to go plot-wise, so most likely audiences would lose interest around 3rd act... and of course be prepared for ""shocking"" Shyamalan-like twist at the end that doesn't make much sense, but hey, they had to have twist ending. Shyamalan would be proud.""Don't Knock Twice"" is about average horror movie, not good, yet not too bad either, and you'll probably enjoy it if you've never watched a horror movie or you're casual audience. If you're horror fan you probably won't enjoy it as much, as you have already seen this kind of a movie one too many times and probably done much better."
" Don't even knock once
",0.0,-0.9944,2017-03-30 00:00:00,4,"This review of Don't Knock Twice is spoiler free ** (2/5) Don't Knock Twice is a lot of things: a supernatural legend about a witch, has murky shadows for intent on better impact just to name a couple of points, but is it original? No. There are so many things this could have been, even scary but unfortunately it isn't. Among the flaky jump scares that hit you with a seemingly decent flow but you rub them off without a shudder; it's also a warmed hash-over of Candyman, Oculus, Insidious and a half-dozen other spook-shows, in addition there is no recollection as to where this is going. With that and the slower than usual pacing this is about as interesting as watching a hamster on a wheel.The demon is also a rehash, from Lights Out it lurks in the shadows chasing after its victims slow at first but gains speed over time, this speed of course is still slow. Director Caradog W. James (The Machine) seemingly didn't know now what he wanted to do here whether he wanted to make a drama about a depressed mother reconnecting with her estranged daughter, or if he wanted to make a supernatural horror about an urban legend instead it's a mixture of the two. Although that is an interesting touch he forgets to go back to its original idea, the concentration on the two central characters sculptor Jess (Katee Sackhoff), and her artsy daughter Chloe (Lucy Boynton) is also the problem it tries too hard to make their story interesting, they both have a past filled with neglect, drug addiction and later regret, and for a while it has a decent flow, they're wobbly chemistry shatters it to pieces.The idea comes early into the film when Chloe knocks on the door of a thin house in the middle of London, in a belief that a witch resides there ""Once to wake her from her bed,"" her friend says ""twice to raise her from the dead."" Of course as is the idea with these supernatural horrors she wakes up and steals anybody who wakes her up, one gets away and she chases down the one who got away. It's the same, all this is, is just a horribly thought out rehash of other spook-shows and although there are some decent scares in place, the rest is a flaky, sadly clichÃ©d mess that means nothing in the world of horror. Miss this one out, it'd be better to watch the original, if you can figure out what the original is.VERDICT: Don't Knock Twice is an awfully thought out horror with an all too familiar story at other spook-shows. Ultimately leaving it as a shallow attempt at flaky scares, murky shadows and atmosphere. Miss."
" Better than it seems!

The whole story is really good, the entity is really scary (and I am not easily frightened person).The mystery unveiled at the end is just mind blowing!"
" Extra points for good reason
",0.4404,0.9502,2017-03-16 00:00:00,7,"Don't Knock Twice could be viewed as a basic 'Urban legend' genre type movie. It has a few things going that set it apart from others of its kind which made me enjoy is a whole lot more. The relationship between the to main characters is an entire story unto itself. As is, the back story of them as individuals. They are actually fairly interesting people with depth that make you curious to know more about them. The really big draw was the lack of special effects. Much like in Insidious, real actors play the roles of the tormentors in this film. I felt it made them more substantial and frightening. There are spots of computer FX but they are minimal. Ultimately this was the saving graces for this film. It magnifies the 'creepy' factor and elevates this movie above others in it genre. Don't expect long running terror like you would get from The Ring upon first review. But, expect a couple good scares, some serious creepy vibes, and some surprises in the story line. Its worth watching. And definitely when you do, you want to watch closely. There is a lot going on in the background."
" It's all clear now
",0.3818,-0.8519,2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"Well, what happened was:Mary was the demon's slave, and apparently so was Tira. There are only two ways to get out of being baba yaga's slave, and those are to either: Kill yourself, or to trick someone into doing something evil--as explained by the movie.Mary did indeed take the kids to feed the demon. And then she killed herself to be free of it (possibly from guilt after being accused of it).Tira (the model holding the baby) on the other hand, tricked Jess by lying to her that baba yaga is just an internet fairy tale, and that to save her daughter, she had to find the real kidnapper. This made Jess believe that the detective was the kidnapper, and through a series of events, Jess led the detective to the demon, effectively fulfilling the part where she was ""tricked into doing something evil"". At the end, Tira killed the husband to get rid of the evidence that she herself probably planted (the folder containing the interrogation with the detective), and her mark disappeared, because she was now freed of the demon's enslavement. The ending scene, was Jess being branded with the seal of the demon, concluding that she is now officially the demon's new slave."

Heck of a lot better than The Conjuring or the second one. Jeez, people are so stupid to easily put down the better movies. I hate to hear what you think is a great or awesome movie.So pathetic to hear people put the better movies down. Read the review that asks what is the ending about. Jeez, not that hard to know the friend with the baby was the one killing and taking the children. She killed the husband. She had the mark on her chest from the necklace. How stupid to not even notice that and right after Jess had the necklace because her friend gave it to her to pass the curse to her.Man people need to stop complaining and just enjoy it. Picky bastards. So what if I ruined the end for most. It is heck of a lot better than some movies out there that people praise a lot. Learn to use the voting above the review box too. So many none voted movies that make movies not rated at all.Ticked they got rid of the bulletin boards. Bring them back. I love this movie and watching it again."
" Without balance you will fall
",0.0,-0.8171,2017-02-17 00:00:00,6,"The Caradog's movie is trying to find a balance between being an indie horror movie and typical, wanting to be, scary pseudo-blockbuster.Unfortunately, because of hesitancy of director, the movie fails, by being too much, or not enough, of everything.We have great shots, cold atmosphere, really climatic music and sound effects. But on the other hand, film is attacking us with cheesy dialogues, not so original scenes (don't want to say clichÃ©s)and really rushed ending.To end on a positive note, I must say, that movie is better than most of nowadays horrors, and it can scare you with a few scenes."

The plot begins with no development of the characters and the conclusion is rushed. In the end, it is difficult to understand the messy story as a whole.

Kinda puts everyone in danger.So Kastee Sackhoff plays an artist who's trying to rebuild a relationship with the daughter she left behind for her career, when her daughter becomes hunted by the town's urban legend.The story lays out pretty cool, but the movie overall is very cheesy, but at the same time it can scare you (or at least the attempt to is decent).Don't knock twice has good creepy sound effects and music that really help set that mood. It's amazing how two movies could have similar visuals yet one movie is able to scare you with those visuals and the other doesn't. Don't knock twice is the other. What this movie does have for you is some great sound that makes up for stereotypical and non scary visuals. The grunts the bumps and the music all work in the films favor Makes sense as the movie's sound is design to make that knocking on a door hunting, which it can be.However, despite that little enjoyment, I would not really recommend going to see it.

Don't Knock Twice does nothing that has not been done before. That said, what it does do, it does awfully well. This is a very atmospheric horror, sounds as well as visuals, play a key part in its success. As does things hinted at or glimpsed, as well as things that are seen.The pacing is good with well timed scares occurring throughout this flick. Moreover, it manages to feel fresh and new even though its a well worn proposition. I personally put this down to decent acting and directing. Ignore the detractors and give Don't Knock Twice a go. Seven out of ten from me."
" Formulaic and forgettable
",0.0,-0.9757,2017-02-05 00:00:00,4,"The special effects are nice and the acting is passable, but this film is way too clichÃ© and formulaic to be enjoyable.The plot is the same as every single other ""chick horror"" movie ever. A pretty girl pisses off a ghost, has lots of scary visions, people don't believe her, she freaks out and acts crazy, at the end she discovers ""a terrible secret"". Bonus points if there's an old house and a mysterious magical person who knows all about the demon/ghost/spirit. It's disappointing that a team of clearly creative and talented British people chose to use this tired clichÃ©d formula instead of writing something fresh and new. Too many horror films do this, it's predictable and boring and it needs to die. I refuse to believe that teenage girls are the only worthwhile demographic for horror."

The daughter is being hunted by a dead witch.Story line was good.

The daughter's peril is introduced immediately with the urban myth key to the plot, then we switch to the mother's predicament, and nothing is normal or easy going - every scene infested with unsettling '80s synth. It ends with flash-back reminders of how the plot is supposed to make sense, culminating in a clumsy twist.The mother is well played, with good emotion in her regret at being inadequate yet loving. The detective is poorly played, and there's hardly any point in the character of the husband. The initial feel is London soap opera, and at various points tributes to The Shining, Ju-On, and Time Bandits.There's one interesting sequence in the photography, when the clichÃ© of ghost passing in the background is repeated three times - otherwise it's ordinary. Bad judgment on the music, but it fits the story telling style of constant huffing and puffing to maintain interest.Overall: meh."

This was by far the most stupid horror film I have ever watched, all because I took a chance on believing what these so called critics wrote about this crap and throwing ninety minutes of my life away. By all means if you like movies with Katee Sackhoff, feel free to enjoy. Personally I will never watch another film she is in, because her acting skills simply suck. She has no range or depth whatsoever. Give me a Ali Carter or Jennifer Connelly any day over Sackhoff for roles like that. Horror buffs stay clear of this garbage. With a better script and a true directors eye, this could have been a cult classic like the Ring or Candyman."
