" Too much expectation that It would be good
",0.4404,-0.7717,2021-02-20 00:00:00,6,"Well.. I watched this because of Max Irons. It could be interesting like School Ties or Dead Poets Society, but sadly there are lack of emotions everywhere. The acting of Max Irons and the restaurant owner are the ones that made me stay until the end of this movie"
" Dissapointing to say the least
",0.0,-0.6908,2020-12-02 00:00:00,2,"Just bad, from start to finish. No more words needed."
" Rarely has a protagonist made my physically ill
",-0.4215,-0.9174,2020-08-28 00:00:00,1,"There are no words for this sad waste of filmroll. The protagonist is seriously the most useless individual ever portrayed on the big screen, infuriatingly so, Things that have been seen can unfortunately not be unseen. Avoid."
" It looks like a bunch of hot british guys doing sh** and kinda is
",0.3612,-0.4041,2020-08-15 00:00:00,6,"Watch this movie was like read this book called ""Let's Go Play at The Adams"", young people doing horrible things and getting away with it like it was nothing. We all know rich people are used to do whatever they want and buy whoever they want, so nothing new here. It feels like there were more to see? a single act of violence doesnt feel like represents what the riot club actually is.The end doesn't surprise, they can do a lot worse and never pay for anything.I must say, a movie with this cast is very distracting."
" This is not a film it's a political hit piece
",0.0,0.6776,2020-07-24 00:00:00,1,"This is the worst and most uncomfortable ""film"" I've ever seen. There were 20 people in the cinema and 5 people walked out before the end. I also wanted to walk out but hoped a good ending might save it. There was nothing good about this story, no good characters, heros or even good human nature. The characters are all supposed to be rich ring wing evil stereotypes with no redeeming features. Likely written by a wealth hating political activist who hates anyone who went to oxbridge. This is not entertainment, it's not a story it has no story arc or hero or saviour. Its like listening to someone complain for 2 hrs about things that aren't realistic or true. Most painful cinema experience I've ever had. The author should have written an article for a left wing Marxist mag instead of a film"
" That Certainly Took a Dark Turn.
",0.34,0.1154,2019-12-29 00:00:00,6,"We will just leave it at that. Started out a lot of fun for the most part but then...we cannot be allowed to have too much of that, right? Not with all the political angst about.Some bits are just hard to watch."
" Lord of the Flies: College Edition
",0.0,0.0,2019-12-27 00:00:00,6,"My two main takeaways are that
1. British boys all look the same
2. This is Lord of the Flies 2.0"
" Flawed but has pertinent themes
",0.0,-0.162,2019-12-15 00:00:00,6,"The Riot Club, an exploration in to the goings-on of an ultra-privileged university secret society, makes some pertinent points. However the characters are one-dimensional and are quite easy to bash, with the main protagonist being almost pathetically weak. Although it is a tough job liking any of these pompous snobs, the film delivers some timely messages, like the sad truth that privilege and money can always dig one out of one's hole."
" Workable slam of British class
",-0.3818,-0.9326,2019-10-12 00:00:00,6,"British debauchery can be charming, such as Four Weddings (1994) or Brideshead Revisited (1981). That is one part here, the other being a private function where things go wrong, a little like The Loft (2014). Midsummer Murders ran a similar theme with Murder on St Malley's Day (2002). The problem with The Riot Club is the script. It comes across as a little too, well, unintelligent, at least for freshmen to Oxford University, and far too unsophisticated for boys obviously raised by university educated parents, and this aspect is not helped by throwing historical quiz questions into the mix. The actors do their bit with the material. Another issue was that a couple of the boys looked very similar, at least to me, with similar hair styles and colour. It confused me, especially at points where good/bad traits began to emerge. The Riot Club is a good character study, and you will cringe one way or another at the carrying ons. It's a moral debate for sure, and perhaps that's a better cup of tea."
" Surprisingly enjoyed it
",0.6705,0.53,2019-10-03 00:00:00,7,"I didn't expect to like this as much as I did!Overall I thought it was gripping, pretty well acted and was disturbing enough to leave me feeling uncomfortable even the following day, which I always appreciate in a film.Many reviews have said that it felt 'irrelevant' which I think is odd- whilst it's obviously taken to an extreme in this film, I thought they portrayed very real issues of class and entitlement. Even more importantly, people with opinions and behaviours like this really do exist; this is loosely based on real actions of a very real Oxford 'elite' club which several people in UK government today were once a part of. I would argue it's absolutely relevant.However, in fairness the film is blunt and obvious in the way it delivers. I feel it's meant to be a gripping and horrifying watch rather than a sophisticated social commentary, but I think it still has a good point to prove and I was absolutely hooked!"
" The most disgusting film I've ever seen
",-0.5709,-0.9538,2019-09-10 00:00:00,1,"I've never been so horrified by a movie in my life. The story is unbelievably poor, the way that the characters act is just shifty I thought going into it I would actually see something good instead I saw women being abused, people being constantly terrorised. This should of never been made and should of never been shown. I strongly recommend against watching this the bloody room is better than thus horrific film."
" A truly repellent piece of work...
",0.4404,-0.8591,2019-05-08 00:00:00,4,"They've made an unpleasant film about unpleasant people behaving unpleasantly. Unfortunately, nothing else about The Riot Club is as clean as its tone."
" Specialty Of The Duke Of Hazardous Ryot: Pubbing And Clubbing
",0.0,-0.9664,2018-10-28 00:00:00,1,"The moral of the film is infected by defected public speech of the drunken, youngish and prudish Aliester who thinks of himself Antoin of France refusing to let a British middle class eat cake and biscuits. This was where I yawned and was all eyes on him a scene later when he smashed a head of the restaurant owner with a wooden stick in a baseball-I-am-gonna-be-alright-manner. Such a splendid attitude to deal with and handle an inner demon. The Riot Club is an Oxford upper-class university fraternity established by many universified Oxforders who went on to become famous for no apparent reason. The establisher of the club entitled it Riot by mistaking letter Yy for Ii when club should had been entitled by Duke Ryot Of England. Nevertheless, they are organising riot from beginning to the end of the film and those who enjoyed watching The Dead Poets Society from 1989 or 1990, whichever, starring Ethan Hawke will also enchant themselves with Rioters. I was kind of shocked with a discovery that British men prefer gardening over aristocracy and, therefore, enjoyed this British riot of a film even more, as long as, hill-billies are not in the original motion picture starring roles nor soundtrack."
" So good, never want to watch it again
",0.4034,0.7322,2018-08-31 00:00:00,8,"I found it a really profound storyline. Meaningful. Colourful. A peak into the modern (and ancient) class divides in the UK. And now horrible rich peopls are. I was captivated as I sat in terror through this movie. Shocked, not by violence, but by the attitude of the memebers of the Riot Club. The lack of empathy, care, humanity.I enjoyed how the plot shifted and got me constantly guessing who is the antagonist and who's the protagonist. It was also a really beautiful movie. The cinematography was great, but not overly original. Great acting from Sam Clafin. But the greatness of this movie is the storyline. Its so good, striking and upsetting that I never want to watch it again."
" The Riot Club
",-0.5574,0.6486,2018-08-17 00:00:00,6,An occasionally tiresome ( mainly due to the unappealing characters involved) film but which fairly successfully develops into a dark drama along the way.
" Contoversy at its best
",0.6369,-0.9756,2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"'The Riot Club' is a thrilling 2014 British drama film, revolving around a small group of born with a silver spoon in their mouths students of the University of Oxford. These people are secretive, but renowned in a narrow circle of other British aristocrats for drunken mischief making. As they exercise their privileges, talk down to everybody and behave ruthlessly, the viewer may actually find it rather disturbing and unpleasant.
Albeit the so-called Riot Club is in the center of the story, most of the screen time is dedicated to Sam Claflin (Alistair) and Max Irons (Miles). The former, not being a shrinking violet, is a hypocritical but clever first-year student, who rejoices in ranting and getting on his high horse. The latter is a rather mellow fellow, who gets roped into seemingly unlimited shady world of binges. Credit where credit's due - both actors performed outstandingly, yet from the very beginning of the film the viewer can witness some plot holes in character development. For instance, at first Milo is presented as a shrewd and intelligent person. However, in 10 minutes he completely turnes around and becomes level-headed. The opposite goes for Alistair.
As for the plot, it is a spate of squandering, swearing, drinking and somewhere going too far. The bottom line in all that reckless farce is a banquet of a rural pub, where all hell breaks loose when Alistair takes on the initiative and starts destroying the bar. Undoubtedly, the introduced characters are bad-eggs, but that moment really flies in the face of common sense. 
Thus, on one hand it is a riveting story of spoiled young people, but on the other hand it is a twisted series of constant smutty jokes and obnoxious behavior that makes one stop watching and forget about the film as a horrid dream."
" Horrific But Gripping
",-0.4019,-0.6597,2018-05-12 00:00:00,8,Gripping in the repulsiveness of its main characters. Not inconceivable that this sort of thing really happens in Britain. Horrific if so. A sort of upper-set Lord Of The Flies.
" Self-crowned Royalty
",0.0,-0.9929,2017-12-02 00:00:00,7,"As the wise man said, the English people seem to need their 'periodic fits of morality', and the producers of this film (HanWay/Blueprint Pictures) have provided a feature-length morality tale that is calculated to bring righteous indignation to the boil.At Oxford University, a long-established elite club is about to hold one of its notorious dinners, with all restraints thrown to the wind, and wholehearted debauchery expected of every member. The appeal of the film is that this micro-freemasonry of just ten young men is out to attack everyone who falls below its own (self-awarded) Premier Division status, and there is even some internal feuding, so the number of people wanting to empty a bucket over the spoilt brats could add up to quite a big audience.The opening sequence is a full-costume cameo of the club's 18th century origins, when blasphemy was a big part of the thrill. Today's equivalent is to slag-off socialism (the orthodox religion of college life), and the excoriating of prole and bourgeois fills-out much of the dialogue, duly spiced with offensive language. We are looking at the Cavalier spirit, all swagger and vandalism, supposedly made acceptable by the feudal habit of paying for damage cash-down.Knowing that Oxford's hotels and restaurants have long since banned them, they settle for a village pub, where a decent, popular manager Chris and his glamorous daughter (recognisable from Downton Abbey) reluctantly risk accommodating them in exchange for the financial inducement.The grand banquet is supposed to mirror all the seven sins and more, with an escort-girl summoned for a group-session under the table, which she refuses. One of the less-horrible characters sends for his girlfriend to relieve the all-male atmosphere, but by the time she arrives, they're all drunk and drugged, and she's offered £27,000 (instantly transferable by i-phone) to perform the act instead. ""We've got the finest sperm in the country"" she is reminded, but just turns on her heel, and never wants to speak to any of them again. Dissatisfied, they set about trashing the room, offering to pay Chris in the standard way. When he refuses their money, they beat him almost to death (just a bit too 18th-century, this touch). At the police inquiry, one of them agrees to take the blame, to enable the other nine to stay at the university. He is expelled, only to find himself eased into a job in London's square mile. The final image is of his self-satisfied smirk.You may or may not choose to accept ""Debauchery raised to an art, almost spiritual"" as their attempt to dignify the whole mess. This is simply a story of excessive entitlement, where it is the Oxford spires that set-off the anger, possibly the envy, and concentrate the blame. The Clermont Set of the 70's (Goldsmith, Lucan) was just as elitist, but caused amusement, rather than outrage. Soon afterwards, the Punk artists were trashing hotel-rooms as a mailed fist against capitalism; if you'd never trashed a room, you were nothing. Meanwhile many third-world dictators have sons of student-age who behave twenty times worse, without attracting the same venom.As usual with college films, the students are acted by people about ten years too old, and they struggle a bit to achieve the casual, disjointed speech of that particular age-group, often interrupted by random quiz-questions, as though they were on University Challenge. But one of them managed to sum-up their whole agenda in a few well-chosen words: ""To eat at the full table of life."""
" This film is one of those very rare films that is truly disturbing.
",-0.1027,-0.7453,2017-11-29 00:00:00,10,"REVIEW - THE RIOT CLUB I have watched many films in my life and many wash over me with no meaning except for a few like I Daniel Blake.This film is one of those very rare films that is truly disturbing. The difference between those who have and those who have not, the difference between those born into money and those who earn it. Horrible, disturbing but essential watching reinforcing the image of we look after our own. Are the characters in this film true? Do people actually act this way? I will never know and honestly never want to be in the position to find out. Rating 10 out of 10"
" A film that makes you feel dirty for watching but still unsatisfied.
",-0.6705,-0.7437,2017-10-08 00:00:00,6,"A cracking film if you want to strengthen your hatred of upper class, privileged, rich idiots. I was expecting to hate this film but I actually enjoyed it despite walking away feeling unfulfilled. It is uncomfortable, unpleasant viewing, with many caricatures, but never quite realises the unsettling conclusion it obviously wants to convey. It is much like ""The Beach"" where it makes you feel dirty for watching but still leaves you unsatisfied.I went to Oxford University and not everyone is posh as sin. You do meet privileged, rich people who went to Eton, Harrow and Winchester but normally they're cleverer than this lot. Only the girls are depicted as being down to earth. My Oxford was not this debaucherous, lecherous or alcoholic. However, the tutorial with Sam West was quite representative as debates in tutorials can get heated at times. I felt the posing and posturing (e.g. during the photograph they take outside the pub) was depressingly unrepresentative of most Oxford Students.It doesn't have much plot and obviously wishes to convey the message that you can get away with anything if you're rich and scheme to the maximum but the quick ending to the movie doesn't justify the message. Alistair (Sam Claifin) ends up taking the fall and gets an offer of a nice job without having to finish university. He has obviously engineered the whole thing to his advantage but this is passed over too quickly at the end of the film to make enough impact.There are some excellent young actors here (e.g. Ben Schnetzer was fantastic in ""Pride"") but they're not really given the dialogue they deserve and they're so visually similar it's difficult to tell them apart at times. Tom Hollander is a fantastic addition as ex-Riot Club member, now 'fix it all' father and it's a shame he doesn't appear more. I was also impressed by Freddie Fox (who acts shallow, all about the fun President of the club very well) and Max Irons (for his distraught, lost it all through betrayal pain). The other young actors play nasty cowards very well.There are some beautiful shots of Oxford, which is a gorgeous city and well worth a visit. It's funny that they mix all the colleges together to make one, for example the dining room is Christ Church (I think) and the 'horrible' rooms shown are St John's - then again you would only know that if you knew the city. The volume changes were ridiculously annoying though, making it difficult to hear the dialogue when there are just two people and being stupidly over loud when there is a party.You're obviously meant to hate all the members of the Riot Club and you do. The emasculation, pay-off and eventual assault on the publican is extremely uncomfortable viewing. The attempted paid rape of Lauren post their ""whore"" rejecting them is repulsive. I don't know what I would have done with the offer of £27k, it's a lot of money but then again I've never given oral sex to a guy in my life. You really do applaud her for walking away and it just strengthens the expected hatred of upper class in favour of the state school student who gets in without having to pay for it.Overall I enjoyed this film but was unsatisfied with the conclusion. It could have been a lot more thriller than it ended up being."
" Boiler plate.
",0.0,0.5574,2017-03-30 00:00:00,6,"It's funny how this same story, if portrayed about blue-collar young men in the USA, would just seem trashy. Here, with Oxford and Brit accents, it becomes some kind of morality play for our times. It is the old story of privilege and class collision. There is no new insight. Perhaps the vicarious drunkenness and violence are meant to draw in a teen audience. The characters are anachronistic at best. The only redeeming feature is its attempt to poke at the class issue with some sensibility, despite the overboard histrionics in the pub scene. Unfortunately, it is still who you know, not what you know. That much rings all too true."
