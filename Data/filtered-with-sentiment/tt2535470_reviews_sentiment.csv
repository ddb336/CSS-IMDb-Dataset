" Suprisingly good
",0.4404,0.8811,2021-04-05 00:00:00,10,"The plot is there, such a fast paced and bad ass movie. Some comedy too. Woah I didn't expect it would turn out that good. I didn't get bored at all."
" Heaps enjoyable and silly zombie film
",0.4588,-0.9161,2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Yes, the plot is often silly and the special effects aren't great, BUT with comedy/horror, I think far-fetched story ideas and extreme characters aid in muting the horror and enhancing the funny bits. There were even a couple of new ideas that I haven't seen in this genre before.Throughout the film, there were certain parts that reminded me of old zombie movies like Evil Dead and Night of the Living Dead; That was in part due to the aforementioned not-so-good effects, but somehow it all works. I do think this film deserves a much higher rating. It's heaps enjoyable."
" Better than I expected
",0.4404,0.9819,2020-11-19 00:00:00,7,"I watched this just because it was free on my XFinity account. Knowing nothing about it, I expected it to be pretty cheesy, but was surprised by how cleverly it was done. I appreciated that it was more than just ""I gotta find my sister"" - the B plot involving her was just as compelling as the main plot. I understand that a few months ago they announced funding for an oft-rumored and well-overdue sequel - if they can keep the creative team intact, it should be a winner."
" Solid Aussie Zombie Flick
",0.1531,0.9633,2020-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Its not often in this day and age that a Zombie film can manage to bring something new the genre, yet this flick manages to bring 2 new zombie concepts and they are both well done. I don't want to give away any spoilers so I'll just say that Wyrmwood zombies are useful in more ways than one.
This is a great aussie film that begins in the suburbs but quickly moves into the bush. And it does move quickly, the action gets started right from the get go. The cast are solid and the special effects and action pieces are well done. Part Mad Max and part Undead, this is entertaining good fun for zombie fans everywhere."
" Popcorn time movie!!!
",0.0,-0.471,2020-09-15 00:00:00,9,Zombie movie with lot of action!!! Ending was awesome. This is a perfect commercial zombie movie with action stuffed on it. It was like the combination of The walking dead and Mad Max: Fury Road.Worth to watch!!
" A hoot
",0.0,0.9314,2020-09-06 00:00:00,8,This starts off as a pacy low budget zombie apocalypse film with plenty of tension and decent-ish acting. Then about 30 minutes in - when Benny teams up with our hero - it switches style to become a raucous comedy. It then turns into Mad Max.The make-up effects and digital effects may not be Hollywood quality but good enough . The swearing is pretty much constant but because it sounds more natural from Ozzie mouths it is funny rather than offensive and the comic acting is spot on (although the mysterious scientist is a bit annoying)..I cannot understand why the overall rating is so low on this as I found it really entertaining with never a dull moment and many laugh out loud moments. Give it a try. It's not the best film ever made but I enjoyed it much more than the multi-million dollar World War Z.
" Great fun, and had a new twist toward the end!
",0.8268,0.948,2020-08-04 00:00:00,9,"It was fun all the way through, but I LOVED the ending!
Proves that you don't need a million dollars to make a great movie."
" Entertained
",0.4019,0.4588,2020-08-04 00:00:00,8,"Usually, if a movie is made in Australia, I tend to skip it, I've been burnt too many times.However, this is a gem and well worth watching."
" What a laugh!
",0.5983,0.9231,2020-07-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie was made over 4 years on a budget of nothing by people having a laugh, and it certainly shows that. It's funny, weird and bonkers all at the same time. Do yourselves a favour and watch it. Take you brain out, put it on the table next to you and just enjoy with a beer."
" great visuals,some cool new ideas,ok lets ruin it by bad acting and cringy funny moments
",0.25,0.9613,2020-05-01 00:00:00,6,"I will keep it short ,this movie had a chance to be great and had some nice new ideas, artistic visuals and scenes from time to time but it fell flat with that poor acting performance and the funny parts did not fit that movie at all ,they were a total cringe ,would have been better to stick to being a funny gory flick or a deep and dark and more serious flick i am an artist and my personal opinion that would have been a great zombie flick as a dark and deep movie and forget about all this horrific comedy parts that fell flat along with some better light editing and mood over all it is enjoyable but the acting and the funny parts was such a a GRINGE"
" Ummmmm...
",0.0,-0.1547,2020-02-04 00:00:00,5,"If not for the bountiful blood and gore action sequences this movie would be atrocious. It's a fun romp if you keep your expectations low. Mind control over zombies? Think Z-Nation. Zombie nitrus for a speedy get away? Kinda cool idea (although short lived). All in all this is a terrible movie, but sometimes even the bad ones can be a fun watch."
" Meh
",-0.0772,0.9495,2019-11-01 00:00:00,4,"Not horrible but nowhere as near as inspired as the hype machines would have you believe. It's pretty much the equivalent of a couple college dropouts discovering GarageBand, making some mix with allusions to better, greater works and then expecting to have it picked up by a record company, because it's ""all that a bag of chips."" Some reviewers have said it has a Mad Max vibe . . . but which Mad Max (1, 2, 3, Fury Road)? It would definitely be the first one due to its indie feel, frenetic energy, and a pair of inspired ideas concerning the zombies. But that's it as far as connections go. On the plus side, this movie doesn't have any major studio trappings and doesn't feel canned or phoned in like much of what Hollywood produces. Overall, it's a lot of been there done that (when you were seventeen years old)."
" surprised how i missed it
",-0.0772,0.8439,2019-10-03 00:00:00,9,After a v long time set my eyes on a zombie movie which was different and worth a watch. Really enjoyed watching it. Its a fun watch. Has lots of surprising moments and things which are different from your conventional zombie movies. A bit of gore for those weak at heart.Wouldn't mind watching again as well.
" Apocalypse Hybrid!
",0.0,0.9946,2019-01-18 00:00:00,7,"It's amazing no-one has really done it before; thought of blending a zombie apocalypse film with a ""Mad Max"" type apocalypse tale. But then up pops this Australian example, which is entirely appropriate I guess, since the original ""Mad Max"" was an Australian film and like this one, shot on a limited budget..At any rate the Roache-Turner brothers decided to test the waters and I for one am happy to report that they've come up trumps, establishing lots of creative twists from two overused film formulas. Primary to their success is creating an action/horror vehicle, which is fuelled with lashings of droll, typical Aussie, black humour and peopled by a plethora of interesting characters.The action hits us from the opening frames and the (admittedly spare) narrative is drip-fed to the audience gradually throughout the ensuring picture. For a budget film, the choreographed stunts and incorporated CGI effects are of a high standard, as is the acting from the long cast list of relative unknowns. The onscreen sibling pair of Jay Gallagher (Barry) and Bianca Bradey (Brooke) make good kick-ass heroes. Bradey especially, since she convinces us of her toughness, despite spending well over half her onscreen time, gagged and chained to a wall. Leon Burchill as Benny gets the best/funniest of the film's lines and older character actor Keith Agius brings a touch of gravitas to his role as a key expositor of what has occurred, as well as being crucial in the creation of the anti- Zombie vehicle that is featured heavily in the film's second half.The film features a plentiful number of good action set pieces without being individually spectacular. And though you'll see countless references and liberal borrowings from many other films, it's to its credit that Wyrmwood is able to maintain interest and suspense through the promotion of some unexpectedly clever script ideas that unfold at regular intervals. A sequel has been supposedly bandied around for quite awhile without appearing. I for one would be interested in seeing how the story might continue."
" Stick with it.
",0.0,0.5579,2019-01-15 00:00:00,5,"Wyrmwood is better than most low quality films.People who enjoy watching bad films, should love it. I'm not one of those, but I appreciated some of what it had to offer. The ending's surprisingly terrific, with Barry and Benny arguing over how they're going to commit suicide without any of the negativity and the glorious fight."
" Not Good!
",-0.4015,-0.6967,2018-12-31 00:00:00,1,This is absolutely terrible! After 10 minutes I wanted to turn it off! I am at 32:56 and I have not changed my mind! After a huge argument with my family we have now turned it off! Spare your self's the hassle!
" Entertaining, but exhausting with no real story to speak of
",-0.6249,0.9612,2018-11-25 00:00:00,4,"For starters, I will say that this movie is NOT boring. It starts out with about 5 minutes of normal movie pacing, then explodes into another 93 minutes of fast zoom camera work, exaggerated sound effects, blood, guts, dark humor, violence, and zombie butt-kicking. The style reminds me of a combination of Evil Dead II, the Crank franchise, and Mad Max. Sounds awesome, right? But here's the problem...1) Pacing:
There is absolutely no pacing. It kicks into overdrive about 5 minutes in and never stops, making it mentally exhausting to keep up with. Films that do this successfully use the technique in select action scenes, then slow it down in order to tell the story properly, then go back to action, story, action...you get the idea. The Evil Dead II did a masterful job of this. But Wyrmwood uses this technique even in scenes that are not really action scenes, so you are always chasing the movie to try to catch up with the story. If you are a person with a fair attention span, watching this will make you crazy.2) Story:
There is no clear storyline to this film. I am always willing to accept plot holes if they help make the movie better, but this movie has a ton of plot holes and underdeveloped characters. The result is you have no idea what anyone is doing and why. It hints at a possible story in many places throughout, but winds up leaving you scratching your head. For example, It never really explains who the government soldiers and especially the crazed scientist are, and what they are doing. The scientist is experimenting on both zombies and humans, but they never explain WHAT he is doing, and WHY. Is he trying to cure people from being zombies? Is he trying to militarize zombies? We just never learn what he is doing, and who he works for. There are a lot of these kind of issues in the movie.When the movie did clarify things, it had some interesting and creative concepts, like zombies creating combustible gas when they exhale (which was necessary, because apparently petrol no longer worked on earth...though again, they never really explained this). Or the fact that the zombie outbreak was caused by a possible biblical meteor shower, and only people with a certain bloodtype were immune from it. But these were presented almost as afterthoughtsAlso, some of the dark humor parts were priceless, like the scientist dancing to KC and the Sunshine Band while experimenting on zombies that were strapped to the walls.The bottom line is this movie is 98 minutes of high octane zombie violence with some funny moments, but with no clear story framework to fit it into. I felt like the creators viewed an actual story as just an annoyance that would get in the way of the action scenes, and it should be the other way around. I'm a big fan of the Australian film industry, but I thought this one was a miss. I give it 4 stars."

" Really enjoyable and fun if slightly troubling effort
",0.5499,0.9794,2018-06-12 00:00:00,9,"During a massive zombie apocalypse, a man who lost his family joins up with various other locals who've been affected by the ordeal to try to find a way to save his remaining family from the ravenous creatures as they encounter those attempting to study how the zombies function.This here turned out to be quite an impressive effort. One of the few bright spots for this one is the fact that there's a slew of stellar action scenes throughout here that play up the fun zombie encounters. From the beginning, where the opening shots of the crew retrieving the truck from a horde of creatures starts this out on a high note which includes the enjoyable and rather exciting battle in the suburbs where it attacks the friend in the garage during the photoshoot turning them into zombies as well as the family's battle to get out of their infested neighborhood. That offers this one with plenty to like and enjoy about it during the proper time which offers up plenty of great moments about them navigating out of the house battling the creatures and setting up the other fun encounters here. The inclusion of the government conspiracy saddled amongst the early action scenes gives this a solidly chilling air about it as the series of tests committed against the local abducted woman allows this to feature some creepy moments about their experiments. The idea of the van full of infected roaming around the countryside carrying on these experiments is a notably creepy idea to start with, and the various scenes showcased here offer up a great twist which is paid off with the later half involving the woman who's half-human, half-zombie that is given the especially powerful new powers of being able to control the creatures telepathically which has a lot of quality moments to like here. The idea itself is incredibly clever and unique which allows for more fun action to come in the final half as well. Coupled with the stellar make-up and gore effects on the multitude of zombies shown throughout here, this has more than enough to hold out over the few minor flaws featured. Among the few flaws here is the film's rather obvious lack of explaining anything that's going on. The concept of the billowing gas cloud they emit as being as source of ignitable fuel is a clever touch, maintaining the idea that the space virus is affecting people of a specific blood-type is ingenious and the military group experimenting on the zombies makes sense yet none of these elements are ever brought together to make any kind of cohesive storyline. These are all issues which play a big role in how the story plays out which is what makes it important to understand the different ideas at play here and is instead not even touched on at all. There's also the stinging issue of the low-budget being quite apparent and noticeable in here, offering up plenty of issues from the rather irritating CGI bloodsplatter to the silly costumes and the utterly irritating and frustratingly annoying shaking camera featured in the big action scenes that make it hard to realize what's happening. These here are what really hold it down.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and drug use."
" Twisted, fast-moving, brutal and bloody.
",-0.7906,0.9426,2018-02-09 00:00:00,6,"A group of heavily armoured folk pounce from a vehicle into the path of a group of marauding zombies. The first line of dialogue we hear is, ""Come on, you f***ing dummy!"" And then, bedlam. A plethora of gunfire, cascading streams of blood, a dash of gore, and many of the walking-dead become quite simply, dead-dead. It isn't a bad start, and lets you know exactly what film experience you are in for.Sometimes it's good to sit back and watch a group of muscle-brained heroes blowing bloody chunks out of a relentless horde of zombies. Except this Australian rollercoaster has an eccentricity that makes it a richer experience than that. There is a thin vein of black humour running through, not entirely unreminiscent of Peter Jackson's 1992 'Braindead'. Here, the grotesque comedy doesn't get as much of a hold and we are left with a desperate chase through a country suddenly teeming with gas-breathing living cadavers that enjoys moments of madness.If you are in the mood for this, it delivers in spades. If not, it might come across as a group of characters whose dialogue consists of 'what the f*** is this,' and 'what the f*** is that?' The occasionally unconventional plot concerns Brooke (Bianca Bradley) who narrowly escapes being devoured by a group of newly formed zombies before being 'rescued' by a military group that takes her for experimentation every bit as deadly as her original predicament. Her brother Barry (Jay Gallagher), who has recently ended the lives of his zombie wife and daughter, teams up with a handful of similarly scarred characters, and proceeds to find Brooke and shoot as many marauding, slavering, dead-eyed 'infected' as possible.'Wyrmwood' is twisted, fast-moving, brutal, bloody and the effects are very convincing. And it's an enjoyable rollercoaster."

A twist happens where petroleum based products are no longer flammable and zombie blood must be used as fuel. BTW Bianca Bradley has A negative blood, a major plot point.Good zombie action. Lots of heads being blown off. I wish the characters had been a little more quirky and some better dialogue.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.

" Turning zombies into red mush is this movie's business, and business is good.
",0.4404,-0.1101,2017-12-14 00:00:00,7,"This ultra low budget zombie apocalypse actioner manages to both look far more expensive than it is and actually be watchable. Other so called ""cult classics"" do not have the entertainment value that is credited to them. This one does. It is relentlessly past faced, action filled, and for something so cheap and down and dirty is decently acted. Still, I almost wish the makers of this movie had tried harder to get a bigger budget at their disposal, as some set pieces are clearly lower rent versions of what could have been with a bit more cash in the wallet. This is not the kind of movie that needs a 10 page analysis, it sets out to deliver zombie killing carnage, and it succeeds. It does not pretend to be anything other than what it is and is the quintessential beer and pizza friday night flick on a big tv with very loud speakers. You had me at dudes with hockey mask and pads with sawn off double barrelled shotguns Wyrmwood."
" Better than The Walking Dead but then again that's not difficult.
",0.2418,0.3197,2017-09-22 00:00:00,7,"Let's face it, a zombie movie is not something extraordinary anymore. There are tons of those movies now and even series. A lot of bad movies, or milked series like The Walking Dead. Wyrmwood: Road Of The Dead on the other hand is an enjoyable to watch zombie movie. With the right dosage of humor. The mixture of humor and gore works very well in this movie. The zombies are freaky and fast, not slow like in The Walking Dead. So for that it definitely adds to the suspense. The story is of course what it is. I never expect much when it is about this subject. That's not why you watch a zombie movie. I never got bored and I laughed enough to make Wyrmwood a refreshing movie in this genre."
" Great Australian Zombie Film
",0.6249,0.1661,2017-07-01 00:00:00,7,"I hadn't heard of this film when I watched it so had no expectations, but I'm glad I gave it a go as the cast and director have delivered a real treat.This is the story of Barry and his sister Brooke, battling Zombies and the military in the Australian Bush.It was only at the end I realised I had no real idea of why the zombies had arrived or why the military were acting the way they were, but this lack of exposition actually made the film a more enjoyable experience, leaving me to enjoy the visuals all the more.And for me the look and feel of this film is what makes it a cut above most other low budget zombie films out there.It owes a lot to mad Max in feel, but manages to be it's own story.One of my pet hates in Zombie films is wooden acting,but here the cast really deliver. I liked the lead characters and wanted to know more.I'm not a fan of CGI effects when you can notice them and that was the case here with some of the blood but that is just a small thing and may have been down to budget and timeAll in all though this was a fun ride and I do hope we I get to see more of Barry and Brooke."
" Kinda Disappointed
",-0.4228,0.223,2017-05-28 00:00:00,2,"No spoilers here, just don't waste your time with this movie, I read the reviews and was like maybe this will be a good movie, nope I was wrong. I'm pretty sure these reviews are stacked for this film. It was trash, stupid and made no sense, They tried to rip off mad max which failed, tried to be comedic, failed. The only plus about this movie is that the actress who plays Brooke is smoking hot."
" Finally! A Gem:Excellence on All Levels
",0.0,0.9937,2017-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Within the first two minutes of the movie, I saw dozens of zombies being blown away by rustic-armor clad humans, with guns, pipes, chains and a double barreled shot gun. And I thought to myself......""Whoooweeeee. Finally!!"" There are phenomenally created zombies shown with nice close up views of them AND in slow motion! No stupid tricks here to try and fool the audience into thinking anyone on set did quality, creative, professional work. None of that too-shaky camera syndrome and swift pass overs or dark settings that are typical of so many crappy zombie films of today. Then within 13 minutes, and most of it spent on some pretty decently edited realistic and clever fight/kill scenes...the film makers threw in a bit of humor. And I thought again to myself. ""Yeaaaaahhhh Baby!"" It's like someone knows EXACTLY the ""odd"" mix of entertainment I find irresistible in an apocalyptic movie and made one just for me..... I think I was feeling a bit giddy by that point. Honestly now, there are some night scenes but you can SEE. My point is the quality of this flick was obvious right from the beginning on up until the end. Then 20 minutes in (The story and pace is fast and exciting) there was a significant twist within the genera introduced. Different, but creative and believable. There were a few times the blood looked hot saucey/ketchupy, but on the whole, gore effects were top notch. With in this same 20 minute time frame, a good look at what the acting would be like thru out the movie revealed the same quality and attention to detail that the previous 20 minutes had exhibited on all levels. The characters were presented with complexity and diversity. The camera work was creatively very well done. I noticed a few editing slips, but nothing that made me lose focus on the entertaining journey I was on. Score appropriate and complimented scenes well without overwhelming them. With all of this in the first 20 minutes, what else do you need? A written invitation? Well, here ya have it. This movie busted outta the starting gate at full speed, top notch high octane quality, so If you like zombie and/or post apocalyptic films, do yourself a favor and don't miss this one. If you are like me and have sat thru sub par movies of this genera, just to get your zombie/apocalyptic fix, you will be as thrilled as I was with this one. It is truly a gem."
" Wyrmwood?... Thyrmwood.
",0.0,0.1811,2017-04-16 00:00:00,4,"What is wrong with Australian horror films lately. They used to be so good with movies like Wolf Creek or the more recent The Babadook. Now recently I have seen the nature gone wild/ killer dog genre completely flubbed by the narcoleptic The Pack and have just suffered through the even worse and more childish Wyrmwood.The premise of Wyrmwood (and no the name has nothing to do with the movie from all I can tell) is simply that a few extras from the latest Mad Max film ran off with a couple of vehicles while in costume and hired the backup zombies from a Michael Jackson's Thriller revival stage show and made a movie. I am making up a plot because the movie could barely be bothered to provide one for me. (Meteors, people without A- blood become poorly dressed extras, man looking for his sister.) Seriously the film has no common sense. If A happens then B should be the result is a premise that seems completely alien to the filmmakers.The acting is okay considering how little they have to work with. The camera work tries to be all impressive but comes across like that guy at a party who keeps telling jokes over everyone's conversations in the hopes someone will like him. If the plot was any more generic it would be sold at the dollar store with a poorly drawn copyright infringing a cartoon character on its front. Note to Australian filmmakers. Stop trying to be Peter Jackson. Also if you are going to go to all the trouble to rent camera equipment and hire actors why not write a story down and film that."
" Too much shaky cam
",-0.2263,0.6782,2017-04-08 00:00:00,3,"I tried 3 times to watch this movie and I could never make it through. I'm writing this right after the 3rd attempt. I like the ideas, the humor, the actors... but this movie is just yet another shaky-cam vomit ride.I suppose they are covering up for being unable to frame shots decently... Whole groups of modern directors seem to think that shaking the camera around is somehow a good idea.Sorry - but it's not fast or dynamic. It just induces seasickness and makes it look like you don't know how to use your camera gear."
" Only 3 minor yet big problems with this movie (spoilers)
",-0.4019,-0.9399,2017-04-05 00:00:00,7,"First of all, this movie is a 6.5, not 6 nor 7.Now, for the problems.My main issue with the movie, was the supporting character - That black guy. He was SO freaking annoying, and ruined perfectly dramatic & good moments. This was the first thing that made me lower the rating from 10 to 9.The second thing is the main character. At the beginning, he was relateable as in acted as everyone. He had a daughter & a wife and pretty much a perfect life (from what we see in the beginning). But... Where did the person go? Where did the guy, who wanted to go out with his family go? He was replaced by a ""LETS KILL ALL THE ZOMBIES YYAARRGG IM ANGRY"" guy, and every time we saw some of the old (and better) guy, with actual emotions and depth, the black guy ruined the damn moment. ""Can I finish the beer?"" While the MC is crying over their friend. WTF.And the last thing, is the beginning. At first they started it as ""So what's your story?"" And I guessed they'll give out their stories from the FAR past, not like a day ago when they met. They could have just started out the movie with the MC's story instead of ""what's your story"" because the MC's story already got us caught with the present.Now, for the good things about the movie.First, you can actually feel the danger and fear (And sometimes even anger) they get from the zombies. They are not all powerful characters and they don't really try to act like it. Secondly, the beginning was beautiful. A man losing everything without being able to kill himself right after he killed his zombified wife & daughter. I expected such depth for the rest of the movie, but alas- I was wrong. The only other time such depth was reached was when the old person got infected in the car.Secondly, the super-human sister brain-controlling zombies sub-story that integrates into the main one is really cool in my opinion.Thirdly, the action is good and interesting, not just BOOM BOOM BOOM. (But of course there's also BOOM BOOM BOOM).And lastly... The ending is so goddamn satisfying. I like this movie. There is much you can improve here, but still."
" A Zombie Movie That Breathes Fresh Air Into The Genre.
",0.3182,0.9886,2017-01-12 00:00:00,10,"If you, like myself, have started to become bored with the ""Zombie-Fest"" the film companies have given us, from the remakes of George Romero's classics to Zombie Nazi's to World War Z, then this is a great big breath of fresh air... or not (you'll get that joke once you watch the film).What you get here is the classic opening and cause for the Zombie plague, a group of falling stars which changes the chemical make-up of the air. The change forces the population to become Zombies, except for one particular blood group... these are our survivors.Along the way you get their stories, an army with a suspect mission, a mad professor with an insane plan to help the human race, and the next generation of Zombie. Even though all of this has been done before in other films, the vigour with which the director, Kiah Roache-Turner gives the film, and the twists to the ""Zombie Myths"" which the writers, Kiah and Tristan Roache-Turner, add give this film and the particular genre a much-deserved kick in the arse.The actors were great and did a fantastic job on the characterisations. I especially liked Leon Burchell as Benny, who blows a guys head off to find he wasn't a Zombie, to which he runs over to the corpse and shouts, ""Is he okay? Is he gonna be okay?""The first time I saw Barry, the main hero, I wasn't too sure of his character or the actor playing him, Jay Gallagher. I was wrong about my initial opinion on the character and actor, as his story is one of loss, anger, revenge, and growth, and shows what kind of psychological journey you would take should the Zombie Apocalypse occur.Bianca Bradey did a wonderful job of portraying Barry's sister Brooke, who is a strong, intelligent, take-no-crap, woman. Frank, played by Keith Agius, is a wonderful character who has a great depth to him, the scene in the stalled truck is brilliant. The mad professor is greatly over-acted by Berynn Schwerdt making him a wonderful psychopath.This film is so chock-full of so many different things, even genres, comedy, action, thriller, with horror being the main genre and I was grateful that the horror feel stayed throughout. I was waiting to be dismayed when it all eventually fell apart. Like watching a plate twirler, you're expecting a plate to fall and smash, and once that happens usually all the other plates follow. When the end came and the credits rolled, I was wearing a big smile on my face, thanks guys for a great film.I caught this as it aired on Film4 though now I'm looking to pick up a copy so I can throw it at my friends while screaming, ""WATCH THIS!""This is a MUST WATCH for any Zombie-ites out there."
