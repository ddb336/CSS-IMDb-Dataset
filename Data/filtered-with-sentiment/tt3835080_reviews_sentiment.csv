" If u watched first 2 stop now
",-0.296,-0.3738,2021-04-06 00:00:00,5,Dont watch this one. 10 years I have (not just me) been waiting for this movie and he completely ruined everything!!!Worst director ever goes to RZ !Rob zombie I hope you are happy with your production.Im done.
" Confused
",-0.3182,-0.4677,2021-03-24 00:00:00,5,"Hoenstly I like pretty much everything besides the fact that the camera was shaking so much any time any action happened?? Idk why, but it was really annoying"
" Blood boobs and bad
",-0.5423,-0.9696,2021-01-22 00:00:00,3,"The good, the guy playing Tomb Head was superb, menacing and almost Joker like in his performance. Very entertaining and compellingThe concept was okay
The bad
1) written by a sexually depressed teenager who fills the film full of sex, perversion and utter dirt and by that I mean the film has a really sticky dirty quality to it. You just want to shower after watching it
2) gore is fine but if that's all you got, it ain't worth much
3) the acting is generally abysmal and the lead female is so bad you can't tell if she's laughing, crying or what
4) it's about thirty minutes too long
5) it's headache inducing cuts and camera trickery, a fight has to be filmed as if the cameraman is on speedAll in all. Grimy, grindhouse type nonsenseEnding is also complete and utter pantsNot worth your time unless you like Rob Zombie and his other movies"
" Actually better than most zombie films, watched the RARE 3d version!!
",0.5399,-0.965,2021-01-09 00:00:00,7,"1st off Rob zombie is an extremely OVERRATED writer/ director his version of Halloween was TERRIBLE!! Cant believe people liked it, especially the added rape scene that was totally unnecessary. He butchered a John carpenter classic that didn't need a new version. His other movies are all 2s and 4s with the backing he gets hes overrated. This movie was actually decent , only because of the actors especially the beginning villian that again appears at the end. He saved this movie with a phenomenal performance and character he created if they would have used him through the whole film it would have been a 9 maybe 10!! The 3d bluray that's rare to find had just basic 3d. I'm still not a zombie fan he mainly uses violence, rape,gore with no story or emotion."
" Ridiculous
",-0.3612,-0.703,2020-12-16 00:00:00,1,This movie is just chaotic and I did not enjoy it for a second.
" Thoroughly appealing, yet lacks a real plot.
",0.0,0.8243,2020-11-19 00:00:00,8,"Though this film is not without its imperfections, I was both intrigued and entertained by every minute. But most important is the shining talent that is Meg Foster, who gives a startling new look to the RZ style we have all become so accustomed to."
" Better than I remembered
",0.4404,0.8923,2020-11-08 00:00:00,6,"I first watched 31 when it first came out, hoping for a lot having seen all of Rob Zombies films and being a semi fan of his music. I felt a little disappointed at the time but wasn't sure why. Having now just re-watched it I've figured it out, it was literally just Sheri Moons performance.
It's nasty, gory, tongue in cheek retro fun and if you can get past the 'leading lady' I think (if those are something you enjoy in a film) you'll love it... On second watch I certainly have"
" How does he still get to make movies?!
",0.0,-0.9477,2020-10-25 00:00:00,1,"Seriously!!! This is just awful. Rob is not a dumb man, certainly be must watch his own movie and see how terrible it is? I just don't get how something this bad not only gets made, but it gets released.Just stop Rob. You're not a film maker."
" Rob Zombies Worst Film
",-0.8271,-0.9577,2020-10-16 00:00:00,4,"I love Rob Zombie films, but this one is his worst film. It is worth seeing if you love his films or just want something violent. But this one is poorly written and doesn't have a great ending or anything. It's a disappointment for Rob Zombie fans."
" Rob Zombie's Version of Saw... I like it
",-0.2732,0.6172,2020-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Despite this not being an original idea, the execution was done well. Solid cast, lots of 70's horror gore, good music and great acting all around."
" Do not watch this movie
",0.0,-0.872,2020-09-01 00:00:00,1,"The worst film ever made.
I don't know where to start with, the plot the acting everything is bad and boring"
" Great Rob Zombie film
",0.128,-0.1796,2020-08-24 00:00:00,8,Rob Zombie has created his personal genre within horror. I really liked 31 and I would go see another like this. Can he get one released by Halloween?
" A fantastic horror flick
",-0.0258,0.7717,2020-08-20 00:00:00,8,31 is by far my favorite Rob Zombie movie. It's a horror flick full of great fun. Some runnworld building and w fantastic opening monologue.
" Stick To Music, Rob
",-0.5574,-0.6215,2020-07-29 00:00:00,2,"I'm glad I caught this while it was streaming free. It's definitely not worth buying or renting. I don't know if this was intended to be a horror or a comedy. It wasn't scary in the least, and certainly wasn't funny. The only thing I found humorous is the likely assumption of the director that he'd created something unique and interesting. He didn't. It's basically a poor remake of Surviving The Game with a little Saw sprinkled on top. There is no character development and the film plays into the same overused stupidity of characters who make dumb decisions - not making sure someone is dead, failing to pick up weapons, etc. I think it's safe to say we're all quite tired of that. I like Rob's music, but master of horror he's not."
" No Soul
",-0.296,0.647,2020-07-17 00:00:00,2,"31 has to be Rob Zombie's most by the numbers film to date. Everything is mannered in that very special Zombie way and it feels like he's just cramming all his favorite things, actors, and quirks into one film simply to keep the engine from getting rusty. You never get the sense that he's passionate or believes in this story or its characters. It's just a cash grab that panders to his most devoted fans. The worst part is that you forget you ever saw it about 15 minutes after it's over."
" Rubbish
",0.0,0.5334,2020-07-01 00:00:00,4,"Tries to make up for its lack of substance by being fun, but it's no fun!"
" Rob Zombie doing his thing
",-0.5574,-0.9383,2020-05-24 00:00:00,7,"This film gets a lot of negative feedback, but I have to disagree. Zombie makes horror films - not family friendly scary films or date night blockbusters. With Zombie you always get his movie. He doesn't conform to Hollywood standards to please the critics. He makes what his fans love, and that is hardcore, brutal, insane horror.31 is a horrific tale full of violence and depravity. It's beautifully shot and at times reminded of 1000 Corpses in the way the cinematography helped tell the story. We've all seen films where a group is kidnapped and forced into some kind of game to the death orchestrated by a madman. Well Zombie puts his stamp on this. He makes it his own and you know it's his. The dialogue written is great as usual for his films - it's funny and it's realistic. The gore is extreme. The characters are original and their costumes are great. Some true art went in to creating these characters and costumes. It was very cool. The violence is uncomfortable. Zombie does a great job as always at invoking that sense of dread and uncomfortableness. It's Zombie at his most brutal and hardcore."
" What the hell Rob?
",-0.8481,0.5392,2020-05-09 00:00:00,4,So this was awful. Not even for a B horror movie was this acceptable. I love Rob Zombie but sometimes he should stick to music. I'm getting tired of seeing his wife in every film he puts out too. She's beautiful but the woman can't act.
" Could've Been A Video Game
",0.0,0.1379,2020-04-26 00:00:00,1,"I remember feeling excited as the film started, this was claimed to be Rob Zombies masterpiece! However, after the killing begins, I felt nothing short of disappointment. 31 would've been more entertaining if it was a video game than a film with the action being nothing more than one-on-one fights. The violence felt bland, the acting felt over dramatic, the editing and cinematography were NOTHING like Devils Rejects (my favorite Zombie film), and I felt disappointed in the end. All of this hype was for nothing."
" Just Another Rob Zombie Movie
",-0.5574,0.9709,2020-04-02 00:00:00,3,"31 is written and directed by Rob Zombie, and was released back in 2016. The film follows five carnival workers who are kidnapped and forced to participate in a sick game where they come face-to-face with death.
Now at this point in his film career, you are either a fan of Rob Zombie or you're not, his movies tend to be divisive due to them being quite crude, graphic and raunchy. I fall somewhere in the middle between the two camps, I don't consider Zombie's films to be overly great (I haven't seen one that I'd consider ""good""), however I am always interested in seeing his new releases just due to their shock factor, and 31 does not do too much to change the formula.
Normally I like to touch on the positives of a film first, however here they remain slim. I enjoyed the opening to the film, it starts are out ominous and little creepy with Richard Brake delivering a decent enough monologue, however I just wish this sequence would have continued with the static shot, I felt like it would have made the entire opening more impactful. Now outside of that, there wasn't a whole lot that was great about this film, there are a handful of shots/sequences I did somewhat enjoy (such as the very ending), however much of this film left more to be desired. Every time there would any kind of action on screen the film would be shot in a handheld way, featuring way too many jump cuts to count and shots so zoomed in making it even harder to tell what's going on. Apart from that, the acting is mostly laughable, the story is alright, however more could have been done with the premise. Overall this wasn't a film I enjoyed but didn't outright hate. It's not the worst thing in the world, and if you haven't seen a Rob Zombie movie before but are interested, this one wouldn't be bad to check out, it's pretty standard of a film for him at this point. I think 31 would please the hardcore Zombie fans, but this isn't going to sway anyone that is not a fan.
In conclusion due to the polarizing nature of Rob Zombie movies, do take my review/rating with a grain of salt, it's just my opinion coming from somebody who still remains neutral about the director, despite him seeming like a cool guy, with a clear passion for horror. So with that in mind, Rob Zombie's 31 gets a 3.5/10"
" If Escape Room stopped being so passive aggressive
",0.0038,-0.1284,2020-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Great watch, will likely watch again, and can recommend to horror / survival fans.A Rob Zombie film in the vain of his others: he has a special flavor to it, and if you already know you don't like his films, then stop looking at them: he's not about to make a rom com you'll like.This premise is interesting as there is a fighting chance: moreso than usual. Imagine the kind of chances they had in ""Escape Room"", but more fighting than puzzle solving."
" Lame
",-0.4215,-0.6478,2020-03-03 00:00:00,3,Basically another Saw with really gross despicable people. Who cares if they die?
" Not Recommended
",-0.1511,-0.644,2020-03-02 00:00:00,5,"In this movie, five people are trapped in some old industrial building and hunted for sport. I'm still not sure why I watch movies like this. I'm not into the kills or the gore. I suppose I'm just looking for something a little different. Well, this was brutal and twisted, but not especially memorable. The characters fend off some of the killers, but the final boss eventually gets them all. The Firefly movies at least have memorable performances, even if they are too over the top for some. The characters in this movie were pretty bland. I can not recommend it."
" Does Rob know what to do?
",-0.5574,-0.9066,2020-02-25 00:00:00,1,"Watched this on Pluto because after the wasted money I spent on his Texas Chainsaw Massacre wannbe House Of A Thousand jokes, I vowed to never waste money on his stuff again!! As true Carpenter fans know, he butchered Halloween & knew he couldn't do anything original!! This joke of a film is no different!! From the constant goofs in the very beginning with the nut job killer to the pathetic script, it just shows he has no clue on how making a movie is!! If you are a true horror film fan like I am, then you will definitely not want to watch ANYTHING Rob you blind Zombie makes!!!"
" Stick to music or...
",0.0,-0.3182,2020-02-07 00:00:00,1,"Hey Rob, your visual style is amazing. Your storytelling is contrived and sucks. Direct someone else's story. Spare us."
" Crass nonsense
",-0.4019,-0.8438,2020-01-18 00:00:00,2,"More crass nonsense from Rob Zombie. 31 is another 'underground' horror feature in which an unpleasant group of travelling misfits find themselves captured by an even worse group of misfits, a random family of desert-dwelling clowns who subject them to depraved torture and random games with often fatal outcomes. It's a plotless, pointless affair, only notable for wasting old-time genre stars (Meg Foster, Judy Geeson and Malcolm McDowell) in nothing roles and generally going over the top in every respect. The whole thing has a grubby, dirty look, with a mindless script littered with profanity and endless gore and nastiness. I feel that Zombie watches the likes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre on repeat but has no idea what truly makes classics like that work."
" Unlikeability mistaken for grittiness
",-0.3612,-0.8981,2020-01-02 00:00:00,2,"Many writers fancy themselves the new Tarantino, try to write gritty characters, and end up with unlikable assholes.
If you don't feel sympathy for any of the characters, horror movies are just boring."
" Not the best Rob Zombie film.......lacking in any real gore
",-0.1139,0.876,2019-12-21 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoy Rob Zombies films.
1000 Corpses was kk. The Devils Rejects a bloody masterpiece.
3 From Hell is fun but lacking. Halloweens were loads of fun. Gory and better than all the remakes and sequels.
Lords of Salem bored me and then there is this.....31......a bit of a step backwards for RZ.
It's nothing that original. Sheri looks as edible as ever but the gore is sadly lacking.......its lazy shaky camera and strobe lighting. Blood splashes everywhere but you never really see anything. Which seemed a bit of a cop out considering what he said jn interviews about making a fun film for gore fans ........... it's not terrible but with more likeable characters and better FX this could have been another cult classic."
" Rob Zombie fails again to detach himself from misguided film-making principles
",-0.7506,-0.9979,2019-12-15 00:00:00,5,"Gore > Style > Substance. A disappointingly backwards way of approaching directing, Rob Zombie frustrates because he shows flashes of talent, but leans too heavily on poor formula. He prides bloody violence over character development, relies on shoddy writing to fill in the gaps between bloodshed, and fails to distinguish his glimpses of quality from being another straight-to-DVD exercise in unoriginality.'31' is about a trio of social elitists who orchestrate kidnappings, throw their victims in an elaborate maze/trap, and then make bets on who'll survive the 12 hours against an array of cartoonishly named, freakishly dressed serial killers sporting all kinds of killing tools. The setup is nothing special, and the characters are all lame, spouting cliched lines and crude quips which can't mask how one-dimensional and expendable they all are.The most promising character 'Doom-Head' played by Richard Brake, who slips into his psychopathic role with enough gusto to prove threatening and at least slightly interesting - particularly his opening monologue sequence - which is nicely shot in black-and-white. Sadly, Rob Zombie does little to appeal to anyone but gorehounds throughout the 100 minutes, offering up moments of artistic horror, but then regressing back to wonky camerawork and over-the-top gore.In the hands of someone else, '31' could have been frightening and bloodthirsty in equal measure but, unfortunately, Rob Zombie's horror film strays into familiar territory and dishes out gratuitous violence with little skill.5/10"
" Dirty... Gory... Just Blatant White Trash Bumpkin Fun
",0.5106,-0.3197,2019-11-27 00:00:00,8,"As an adherent of the great director Rob Zombie, I am confident in saying that 31 is my favorite film in his portfolio. A story about a group of travelers who are abducted and tormented by an underground society of wealthy individuals who wager on the lives of their victims.This movie starts off with one of the most amazing monologues in horror film history, when Doom Head (Richard Brake) preaches to one of his victims who just so happens to be a Preacher Man. This scene sets the tone for the dirty gore-fest to follow.I decided to give this movie an 8/10 because of the rawness that Rob Zombie gives. Plus there is a Hitler little person, what could be better than that?"
" Freakin' chainsaw wielding Meg Foster!
",0.0,0.9599,2019-11-24 00:00:00,6,"Entertaining though lesser Rob Zombie grindhouse outing. Zombie takes inspiration from ""The Running Man"" by way of grungy 70s drive-in horror flicks (i.e. ""Funhouse"" ""Last House on the Left"" ""Tourist Trap"" etc.), telling the story of five carnies who are kidnapped and forced to play a violent game for a powdered-wig wearing Malcom McDowell and Jane Carr. The hapless carnival workers are locked in a warehouse/arena of sorts where they must fight to survive increasingly challenging opponents, all who have the hyphenated name -Head. Some of these villains include Sick-Head, a knife wielding Nazi little person, chainsaw wielding clowns Psycho-Head & Schizo-Head, coquettish clown Sex-Head (E.G. Daily) and German clown Death-Head, and the penultimate baddie Doom-Head (an excellent Richard Brake). ""31"" is filled with Zombie's usual stock company of actors, including Daniel Roebuck (""Carrie"" ""Miami Vice""), Lew Temple (""The Devil's Rejects"" ""Halloween""), Jeff Daniel Phillips (""Halloween II"" ""The Lords of Salem""), Torsten Voges (""The Big Lebowski"") looking very Alexander Godunov, Ginger Lynn (ex-adult film star), and Judy Geeson (""To Sir, With Love""), but of special note are the hero, Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie, Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs of ""Cooley High,"" and Meg Foster of ""They Live"" and ""Blind Fury"" fame. For my money, a chainsaw wielding Meg Foster alone is more than enough of a reason to watch this film. As a writer and director, Zombie is not really stretching himself with this material, although ""31"" is somewhat of a return to form after the disappointing ""The Lords of Salem"" where he was less successful in creating an arthouse style of horror film, ALA ""The Wicker Man."" Still, although this is pretty familiar territory for Zombie, it's awfully fun, especially (SPOILER ALERT) the film's finale where Sherri Moon barely escapes with her life, bloodied and staggering down a sun drenched country road ALA ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", only to find Richard Blake pulling up in a van, pulling out his menacing switchblades as Sherri turns to face him, balling her fists as Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" builds to it's climax when the film cuts away before the two actually do battle! It's a badass bold move to not show this final showdown, which made me far more excited than annoyed. It's also a smart move for a low budget film, which this most certainly is. Overall, this is easily Zombie's most conventional film in terms of story and is pretty short on any character development, but it remains true to his over-the-top throwback style and in some ways is arguably his most polished movies as a filmmaker, which makes this well worth watching for fans. Non-fans should probably subtract a star or two."
" Flawless horror film
",-0.1027,0.9511,2019-11-23 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a very entertaining and well made horror film. Rob Zombie's best in my opinion. Doom-Head was a very good villain, his performance was very good and dark. His opening monologue was very good and creepy and sets the stage for his character and the rest of the movie. The acting in general was good and the main characters were likeable. The plot was somewhat simple, but it did not need to be anything special. And the movie gets into things pretty quickly, no unnecessary development. Once things get going, the movie was very, very, intense. Some very brutal and gory kills throughout. The ending was very interesting and perfect for the film. Nice cinematography. Great horror film."
" Gore

" Why a 7?
",0.0,-0.8906,2019-11-15 00:00:00,7,"I'm a zombie fan. I held off on 31 from the reviews. I saw 3 from hell and wanted to convince myself the Rob Zombie I know and love still had it in him. This wasn't about character work or plot, this was about giving fans the brutal zombie film they wanted him to make. And it worked. Is it perfect? No. It isnt meant to be. This is a love letter to the fans. The only reason I have it a 7 is because the R version very clearly holds back, and I blame the MPAA for not having the guts to let the masses choose for themselves what they want to see. Hopefully the unrated version surfaces for us fans that just wanted to let go, let our brains turn to mush, and enjoy the mindless imagery and sheer violence on screen. I'm glad I finally saw 31, as it washed the awful taste of 3 from hell out of my mouth. I'm still with you Rob, keep em coming. And if you ever read this? Forget the fireflies now, give us more Doom Head."
" Worth the watch
",0.2263,0.7579,2019-11-10 00:00:00,7,I think this movie is worth the watch. It had good plot. Some parts seems rushed and the movie seems to be finished too fast. Could of been more levels I think of the game. Some cool gore parts and such. Of you like rob zombies movies you'd like this
" Not Zombie's best , but not unwatchable
",-0.2924,0.9946,2019-10-29 00:00:00,4,"First of all I am a huge rob zombie fan , not his music , but his movies, I love his style of filmmaking and his vision.Now don't think that I hated this movie , I did not but it my least likeable of zombie's movies. I didn't like the killers in this, especially some of the acting from the killers was below par. The best performance comes from Richard brake as an absolute maniac he should be given an Oscar for this role. The setting and locations was not scary or visually interesting to me in any way. I just didn't like the storyline. I loved the ending , it was super ambiguous and you root for the final girl. That's the only positives that I can think off about this . I certainly don't hate it but I wouldn't watch it more than 2 times. Its my least likeable of Rob's films and I don't mean that in a bad way. I just think he should have done something more or went a different route with the killers.
Overall not unwatchable , but not his best.

" Not that bad
",0.431,-0.9107,2019-10-19 00:00:00,4,"It's not anything great, but it's not that bad. I'm not sure what everyone is so mad about. It's a decent horror movie."
" Interesting Concept, but Issues with Execution
",0.2144,0.9802,2019-10-13 00:00:00,6,"This was a film that I remember hearing about, but didn't get around to seeing it when it dropped. I was turned off a bit when I heard a lot of negativity toward it. I still added it to my list of films to check out as I like to decide for myself. I thought the title was interesting and especially when it came out, in that this takes place on Halloween. The synopsis is five carnvial workers are kidnapped and held hostage in an abandoned, hellish compound where they are forced to participate in a violent game, the goal of which is to survive twelve hours against a sadistic gang.We start this off with a monolgue from Doom-Head (Richard Brake). His face is done up with white paint and there's blood around his nose and mouth. We finally see that he's talking to Pastor Victor (Daniel Roebuck). He pleads to be let go, but is murdered instead.It then shifts to a group of carnival workers. We know that it is Halloween in 1976 and they're traveling through the desert. They're led by Venus Virgo (Meg Foster) and with her is Charly (Sheri Moon Zombie), Roscoe Pepper (Jeff Daniel Phillips), Panda Thomas (Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs), Levon Wally (Kevin Jackson) along with two other women and their driver. They stop off to get gas at Lucky Leo's (Tracey Walter). While Roscoe fills them up, a woman shows up and flirts with him. She is played by Elizabeth Dailey and she seems really concerned if they're going hunting or not.This group gets back on the road until they come to a roadblock of what looks like scarecrows. They get out to move them and are attacked by people. They then wake up in a grand room where Father Murder (Malcolm McDowell) is dressed up as a French aristocrat from back in the day along with Sister Serpent (Jane Carr) and Sister Dragon (Judy Geeson). The odds are revealed on Charly, Roscoe, Panda, Venus and Levon to survive this night They also meet the first person that is going to hunt them, Sick-Head (Pancho Moler). He is a little person who is dressed like Hitler. The goal is for the group to try to survive 12 hours while they're hunted by a gang of clown like killers called 'The Heads'. They're separated and each given a weapon, but this game becomes darker as they go.Now I wanted to go a bit vague with this recap, because to be honest there's not a lot to the story and it really doesn't take too long to get into it. I really love this concept though. This actually feels a lot like the game Manhunt that I used to play in high school, but just inserting the idea of these killers we get here. I like that there are bets being made, but I do have issues as well. The three people we see who are running the game are rich, but who are making the bets? Just them or are others watching this? I think that they could have gone deeper with this with more story actually.I do think that the killers being clowns are a bit misleading as well. Yes, all of them are wearing white face paint of some kind, but that's really where it ends. The names aren't the greatest, but that is really me knit-picking a bit here if I'm honest. I don't get why they have a Hispanic man who is a lover of Hitler. The rest of them make more sense, but that one really just confused me. I do love the idea of these killers having personas a la The Running Man.This is also writer/director Rob Zombie making another attempt at making grindhouse cinema. I do have to give him credit, with the filters used, it does look that way and before they head into the game, it does feel of the era. It is also brutal with the extreme violence and some of the gore. I actually think though the film needed to either deepen the story or go more gory to actually work better for me though.Going from what would work better, I just found this to be boring for stretches. There were a couple times the film cuts away from showing us the blood that this film really feels like it needs. It also just didn't capture me to really follow where we were going. The ending doesn't fit the build of this game they're going for, especially with how they build up Doom-Head. It just kind of feels like it wants to do more and doesn't deliver. I also feel that they establish our 'heroes' are very trashy people. I really don't care about them as it feels like bad people vs. worse people, which is an issue I have with previous Zombie films.That moves me to the acting here. Sheri Zombie is fine, but I think this is just another vehicle for Rob to show us how good looking she is. I think her performance is just kind of there and doesn't really add a lot. Phillips I think is best of the 'heroes'. I wasn't overly impressed, but he doesn't hurt the film either. Jacobs, Foster and Jackson are all fine in their roles, but don't add a lot. McDowell I felt was underused and being with Carr and Geeson are fine in support of him. I just think we needed to know more about them or the game to work. Brake though was absolutely amazing. His monologue to start the film was a bit out of place, but he is the one bright spot for sure. The rest of the killers are fine and round the film.I'm going to shift this next to the effects of the movie, which when they're showing it look good. Blood and what not looks realistic, but there are times that it does cut away and that hurts a film like this. I think the setting they're in is quite creepy and you never really get a good idea of the size of the building they're in. I think that really gives it a disorienting feeling. The look of the killers is pretty interesting, except I'm confused by Sick-Head's concept. The film though is shot fine as well.Now with that said, this film I think had some really good potential, but really just falls a bit flat for me. I like the idea that on Halloween, a game like this run, but I really think we needed to know more. Who is watching? Is it just these three rich people or others? I also think it is a misstep to make the heroes as trashy people as they are as it doesn't work to root for them against the villains, even though Doom-Head and Sick-Head are as worse than they are. I think the acting is fine aside from Brake, who is great. The movie is really just kind of boring unfortunately and the ending is anticlimactic. They cut away from some of the death scenes, but when they don't, it does look really good. The soundtrack is fine for what is needed, but it really didn't stand out to me overall. I was quite disappointed with this one. I still think this is slightly above average, but I would really only recommend it if you're a fan of Zombie. Overall though it's definitely his worst film from what I've seen."
" Some fun moments but mostly a snoozefest
",0.2846,0.8317,2019-10-08 00:00:00,4,"October is one of my favorite months to watch horror movies and Rob Zombie is usually bankable for good horror, especially with the House of 1000 Corpses and the Devil's Rejects. The Halloween reboots are also pretty good, but the most recent Zombie offering to date, 31 falls off the table a little bit.It's set up sort of well for the beginning shot before the opening credits, which is a Zombie trademark . Then the gang gets introduced with lots of hangers-on from his other movies including his wife, Sheri. They are carnival workers who ride around in an RV but then get stopped by props blocking the road on the outskirts of a small town. When they get out of the RV to move the props aside, yikes! A band of thugs overtakes them and kidnaps them.The next thing they know, they're bound and gagged and presented to a grease painted couple in Renaissance wear who gleefully inform them they will now take part in the game 31, in which they have 12 hours to survive a series of tests.It's an okay premise, but after that there's too much fumbling around in the dark with hand-held cameras. I fell asleep on the movie because it totally lacks the fun shtick from earlier Zombie movies like little solarized outtakes, funny character quirks and goofy theatrical moments. If I'd paid $10 to $12 in a theater to see this I would have asked for my money back, seriously."

This however was the first of his films that felt rushed and unplanned. The use of elements of Eli Roth's Hostel feels desperate for material. Richard Brake as the demented Doom-Head is the only character that generates menace in this thing. Not a terrible movie but just blah

I'm no stranger to the genre. Zombie has never once put his directing skills to use on a story worth watching. He is a massive disappointment and a squandered talent.

" Not ""good"", but lots of fun
",0.6652,-0.7565,2019-07-19 00:00:00,8,"Let's get two things straight right off the bat - 1) if you're watching this, you probably know who made this movie. You probably know what to expect. 2) this is not rob zombie's best. This is not close to his best. So that's been established, and now we have to look at this movie within the context of a not particularly good rob zombie movie. The result is, quite frankly, an incredibly entertaining mess. Rob's typical characteristics are present; ridiculous characters, terrible acting (especially from Sherri Moon, like usual), juvenile humor, unnecessary nudity, and lots of blood.
You've got your 5 generic, flat characters, the ""survivors"", who are dropped in a generic ""survive for 12 hours while people try to murder you"" situation. The fun here comes from the 6 ""heads"" who are sent to kill these guys - you've got a perverted Latino Nazi midget, two perverted psychotic clowns, a giant German guy with long hair, goggles, a spiked bat, and a tutu, a... Harley Quinn/that one Blade Runner replicant type lady, and then Richard Brake, who I'll get to later. These guys are so over the top and absurd that it's hilarious and it's a great time watching them be absolutely insane. Also, the set design is quite good, being basically a creepy dilapidated warehouse/factory/carnival/the bathroom from saw. We run into some problems when it comes to the camera work that looks like it was strapped to one of those WWE guys and the lighting that can give non-epileptics seizures - this makes it sometimes difficult to tell what the heck is even happening. Thankfully, there's a satisfying amount of blood and gore and brutality for a gorehound like myself, and if that's what you're looking for, you'll have a good time. The kills can be seriously brutal and it's fantastic.
There's also Malcolm McDowell and some other creepy old rich people playing the game/narrating/betting on the characters and some naked girls for the sake of there being naked girls. I love Malcolm McDowell but these parts aren't anything to write home about.
The big reason, aside from the gore, to watch this movie is Richard Brake as Doom-Head, the final killer with a perfect record that's good at his job. The movie starts out with a six minute monologue from him that's just amazing before he murders a priest (although I still don't know what his story is?) and then he isn't seen again till the last half hour. But this last half hour is brilliant. We see Doom-Head getting ready, killing some people, being ridiculously cool and quotable, etc. and then comes the final showdown. Interestingly, Rob Zombie waits till the very end to deliver what we (fans of work) know he can do - craft a genuinely excellent scene. The music (it's Aerosmith), Richard Brake's facial expression, the camera angles, the timing, the cliff hanger ending, it's all surprisingly perfect.
I watched this movie once when it came out and knew Brake was the star but I didn't remember until I rewatched it just how great of a character Doom-Head really is. He's the best Joker that never happened aside from Willem Dafoe. He's just, man, just watch the movie and get through the middle even if you don't care. Hell, you can doze off from the first kill to the last half hour knowing the basic premise and it's still amazing.
Yes, it's not a good movie. But what were you expecting? Go in expecting blood, absurdity, and all the things you like about Rob's movies, and you'll be entertained. Go in expecting a legitimate plot, good cinematography, rich character development, and, well, a good movie and you'll be disappointed. And for the love of god if you are not familiar with Rob Zombie do not watch this movie because you will hate it and you will not get that there's nothing to get and you will be disgusted and probably offended and you will leave a bad review."

But 31 is my favorite horror trope (deadliest game!!) so I decided to force my way through.Doom Head's speech is what starts the film off and boy, I gotta admit I was PUMPED. Scary, interesting, gory with depth -- it promised so much. He ain't clown! He's not here to brighten your dismal day. He's not here to elicit an amused response. But he's going to tell you a story so the CRUNCH of your body isn't the last sound you hear before he sends you to the pearly gates with a first class ticket.It's terrifying. It's funny. It's grim and it's brutal. If he's our villain, I'm fully on board and writing Rob Zombie an apology letter for every horrible thing I ever said about him.What did I get instead?A little person dressed as Hitler who likes to rape people.

",0.0,-0.881,2019-07-13 00:00:00,3,"As to the title, presumably because the game of ""31"" is played every October 31st. Not a very inspired name for the game or the movie, which gets to the central problem of the movie: it's not very inspired.I liked The Devil's Rejects; for what it was, it was extremely well-done. FWIW, I dig White Zombie too.When it comes to horror, though, I don't care for retreads. A genre which arguably has a greater freedom to be transgressive than any other mainstream genre arguably should be taking advantage of that freedom. But just as many people with the freedom to vote don't bother to vote or even to register to vote, so too does horror often fail to deliver.Part of the problem, I guess, is there's a lot of horror fans that DO like the same thing over and again. Rob Zombie was apparently catering to that.Does he himself like the same thing repeatedly? It certainly seems that way. I'd be curious to see what he might do if he stepped out of his comfort zone: direct a film written by someone else (and not one written specifically for him), do not include Sheri Moon Zombie in the cast (have her work crew if he dislikes being away from her for too long), do not set the film in the 1970s, do not use clowns, do not reference Nazis, do not over-rely on blood & gore.

I think it's a blast the way it is, sure it's dark in many aspects some may not like how there's not really a character that isn't a glow of positivity & that's ok with me.Doom Head/Richard Brake really stole the show in the best way possible with his menacing presence early on with clever morbid lines the first bit with him is very intriguing & leads the rest of the film in a exciting way. Many other characters are great too in my opinion, then others not so much. I don't usually do this but I'm glad some got killed off!I love the teasing/banter some scenes have; the music is great as always in a Rob Zombie film, it's gross in a fun way, disturbing, even ridiculous in some parts, & it's important to note there's a part with shaky cam with lights flashing a fair amount if someone is at risk with seizures that'd be very bad.

I didn't hear much about this movie before watching, but just it being a RZ film I was expecting it to be similar to other favorites like Devil's Rejects, House of 1000 Corpses and the Halloween movies of his. I even thought it would top those, but I was wrong. It is not even close! Sure there's the gore and all, but with the shaky camera effect (which was so overused) and expected outcomes it was just a huge disappointment. There was no real good storyline either, just a bunch of random people with no background being thrown into what was supposed to be a carnival type killer game that sort of just left them running around some building. The kills weren't scary and were almost expected and there was no real rhyme or reason to anything. Can't even recall being scared in any part, I honestly almost turned it off because I was so bored with it. The only decent part was not having to pay to watch this like everybody else did.Even though this movie was terrible, it doesn't effect me ever watching one of his movies again just because of how good his others have been. I'm just glad I didn't pay to watch this one or it would have been even more of a let down."

",0.5994,0.9525,2018-11-08 00:00:00,7,"First off, this film is a joy to watch, just, beautifully shot. Far more thought out and well executed (no pun intended) than Zombie's previous works. A few stellar performances (Richard Brake as Doomhead is not the only mention worthy, but he is fantastic) help create a hellish atmosphere that repulses and attracts you at the same time.A thin story, a kind of Hostel meets Running Man meets The Purge, comes up as a reason why many reviewers didnt like the film. However...I watched Hereditary this week, and having loved so much about the film all the way through to the end, only to have that crushed at the last minute (literally, the last minute or two of the film) because of a cramming in of loose-end tying garbage that felt like a screen writers last minute chance to explain everything that REALLY didn't NEED to be explained.I didn't get this with 31. I had room to ponder, come up with my own ideas for why what I was seeing might have been occurring. Zombie isn't fussed about injecting character driven relatability into his films if it's going to feel like someone smashed a puzzle piece in until it was forced where it didn't fit. He wins at atmosphere... sinister, weird, uncomfortable, inexplicable. He wears his Influences on his sleeve, and doesn't try to be insincerely 'clever'.31 is good. Really good. Beautiful to watch, the sound design is excellent. There are some super performances. I loved it and will be surely watching it again soon."

But, I understand how his movies aren't for everybody.This is a pretty straightforward slasher flick. I found the Kafka quote and monologue from Doom-head in the beginning to give a great idea of what this movie was going to be.While my initial impression of Sick-head was to laugh, within a few minutes the lighting and atmosphere and his confidence contrasted against the fear of the victims made him scary.This is what made Psycho-head and Schizo-head not particularly scary. At this point the victims had gained their resilience and the villains seemed more on an even playing field.For me, Richard Brake was the star in this. I wish there was more of him. Doom-head's control and obedience to the rules made him the most terrifying of them all.Rob Zombie does a good job of catching the moments in movies when you scream at characters for not having done something and fixing it. He also spends more time on his villains than his victims. Can't blame him though, who lives till the credits?It wasn't big on story but it did a great job of making an terrible circumstance a true possibility."

There are plot holes you can drive a truck through. It didn't make any sense at all once you start to dig into it. Thearacters are fairly uninteresting and it really felt like Zombie was just phoning it in. The dialogue and horror relied strongly on over used tropes, there was little imagination.

I have heard so much hate for this movie so maybe my expectations were low, even then, I don't understand the hate for a film that isn't even trying to be more than one more slasher in the genre, it was kinda of gory but not too much to be grossed out, it was a very balanced meal. The concept was great but I expected 31 killers sent out at the same time so the fact that they go 1 by 1 and that they are only 6 was underwhelming, but then again, I think he saved it with style, the ending is a beauty, not as a huge beauty as The Devil Reject's Freebird, but, a pretty soft unpretentious, chill, great ending that made me feel the greatness of slashers and the beauty of the last character alive.

Since Zombie never ""starts normal,"" all his characters are the most foul-mouthed, low-life people you'd ever meet. Then they meet others worse then them. The odd thing is the three characters dressed up in aristocratic clothes--they are never explained and their backstory would have been interesting to know. The killers are pretty dull--a Nazi little person, some chainsaw guys. I mean, nothing original and everyone pretty much leers at the camera. I think LORDS OF SALEM was his best felt--a great look to it, a somewhat original idea, but 31 is just a tired retread. Since his movies don't make any money at the box office, he crowdfunded this--and it didn't make any money, either. But he said that because he crowdfunded it, he could make the movie he wanted with no studio interference. Well, he did, and it's a dull mess."
" Awesome film
",0.6249,-0.9628,2018-03-14 00:00:00,10,The movie was very good and entertaining I love the whole murder world plot. Rob zombie once again has done something brilliant to entertain his fan base. As always on this dreadful site a lot of dreadful people crying that the movie was very horrible just proves to you that the population is garbage seriously though why do stupid people still watch something if they hate it it just a bunch of lousy no good turds that all. Ignore those unworthy aholes and watch the film
" One of the worst I've ever seen...
",-0.6249,-0.9906,2018-03-08 00:00:00,1,"As an adamant horror movie fan, I happened upon this movie, thinking it would be just another cliche survival horror films. Instead, I found one of the most disgusting films I've ever seen, one that I couldn't even stomach finishing. I don't tend to be bothered by gore or vulgarity, but this film took everything to another level. The characters were uninteresting and poorly developed, even by horror standards. Combined with poor acting and even worse dialogue, the film was a complete mess. and unbearable to watch. There were whole scenes in this movie that could have been taken out, being placed in to have no other purpose but shock value.I wasn't expecting the best of the best here, but I was so bothered by this film that I actually needed to write a review to tell others just how awful it was. I couldn't imagine what Rob Zombie was thinking when making this and quite frankly I don't know what I was thinking when I picked this film to watch.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS!!!"
" How could a nightmare be any worse than this reality?
",-0.4767,0.9246,2018-02-06 00:00:00,6,"Five travelling carny workers - Charly (Sheri Moon Zombie), Panda (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs), Venus (Meg Foster), Levon (Kevin Jackson), and Roscoe (Jeff Daniel Phillips) - are abducted by a sick bunch of freaks and made to play a sadistic game of survival. The proceedings are run by macabre Masters of Ceremony - Father Murder (Malcolm McDowell), Sister Serpent (Jane Carr), and Sister Dragon (Judy Geeson) - and the mean s.o.b.s who torture, taunt, and kill them have names like ""Sick-Head"" (Pancho Moler), ""Death-Head"" (Torsten Voges), and ""Psycho-Head"" (Lew Temple). The absolute worst of the bunch is a monster named ""Doom-Head"" (Richard Brake), who revels in his job.Rob Zombies' crowd-funded movie was a return to the sort of blood-soaked depravity with which he made his name, after too much disappointment was expressed over ""The Lords of Salem"", his attempt to step outside his usual wheelhouse. Once again, he shows that his way with dialogue tends to be hit-and-miss; sometimes he comes up with something quotable, but most of the time it's just insipid. The opening scenes that establish our protagonists are rough going, and don't exactly endear the characters to this viewer. Therefore, it's hard to care much about what happens to most of them. Zombies' inane script, which lacks imagination and wit, makes a waste of some good atmosphere, production design, and cinematography.All of that said, the casts in his films are usually pretty eclectic. Tracey Walter, Daniel Roebuck, and Elizabeth Daily also put in appearances. The standouts include old pro Foster, who gets to be pretty badass, and character actor Brake, who's definitely relishing this moment in the spotlight. His is a villain who obviously enjoys what he does.One more good thing about Zombies' efforts are the soundtracks, and this one is no exception. The music that plays over the closing credits is especially groovy.Fans of hardcore horror and Zombies' loyal fan base are certain to be amused, but this will likely be a struggle to get through for most folks. Brake and Foster raised the rating a bit for this viewer.Six out of 10."
" Another step in the wrong direction for Zombie
",-0.4767,-0.9931,2018-02-04 00:00:00,5,"In the black and white intro some guy gives, I kid you not, a 6-minute speech to the camera. Well, he's supposed to be talking to a priest he's been torturing and eventually kills him with a hatchet.Next we meet perhaps the most unremarkable and dullest cast of character this side of a lost-footage horror. They are driving somewhere when they run into a bunch of scarecrows blocking the road. When they stop and get out, they are attacked by a bunch of guys. Two of the characters are killed for some reason. The rest are taken to what looks like a church where they are chained. They are told they are now part of a survival game called 31 (why 31?). They have to survive a bunch of killers who will go after them one by one. The game will last 12 hours. The organizers place bets by ranking which on of the goofs will last longer.The first killer is a Hispanic little person dressed up as Hitler (what the...) who delivers most of his lines in Spanish for no good reason whatsoever, even though he can speak perfect English. Yup, so here you have 5 adults (3 male, 2 female) each with a club or some weapon, screaming, running in horror, and hiding from some little person cursing in Spanish.Next they have to face two guys with chainsaws. Then a big German dude and his sexy girlfriend. At last the survivors have to face the guy from the intro who is the expert killer. In between the challenges we hear the organizers talking about the odds and placing their bets.Of course one person survives for the weirdest of reasons. And then there's a very dissatisfying ending, not just in terms of the main villain and the main good character but also in terms of the organizers of the whole thing. No answers about anything are provided.31 just doesn't work. The cinematography is dark and ugly. Dialogue is utterly pointless. Direction is a mess, editing is a disaster. The music is good though. The main concept isn't bad, or new for that matter. A game of death where a group of people have to survive attackers so the decadent rich can entertain themselves and play with the lives of regular folk, but with a touch of Rob Zombie. It should have worked as a gory movie. Instead they cut this movie down to an R-rating and it bombed anyway at the box office. When will they ever learn? The only thing they get by censoring a horror movie is alienating the fans. And Zombie must have fewer and fewer of those with every movie he releases. And it's understandable, his movies are getting worse and worse. It leads me to wonder, just who did really direct The Devil's Rejects? The long behind-the-scenes feature explains a lot. Zombie's movie-making process is a catastrophe. He has a ""whatever, anything goes"" improvised approach with little in terms of a vision. He doesn't care about the end result the audience will see. He opposes a ""polished"" product, which is fine if you go with the ""raw"" concept and actually take it seriously and do something with it. He seems rather disinterested and bored with making movies. Personally, I don't have a problem with the performances. Sure, not all are that good, but many are. Elizabeth Daily is just adorable. Richard Brake gives a remarkable committed performance.There's some nice nudity, the occasional gore but not much else worthwhile."

You kind of assume that after a few years of doing anything, you would get better at it. Zombie has regressed. Or simply gotten lazy.
No matter, this thing was awful. I won't bother to analyze specifics here, but the man should go back to music and leave moviemaking to the talentless amateurs of the world....cuz they make better flicks."

As long as I ca remember, I've been a massive Zombie fan. House of 1000 Corpses, the remake of Halloween, Salem's Lot.. along side his talented, amazing wife Sheri Moon he has done some awesome horror movies. This one however, apart from the monologue of Doom-Head in the beginning, felt like it was just a joke. The plot being from a generic horror movie and that DAMN SHAKY CAM defining every fight scene I felt like I'm going to give up. The killers were ridiculous and the ending just didn't make any sense to me. I don't know if poor Mr. Zombie has dementia or what but he needs to wise up and return to the good stuff. I gave a extra point for the movie being a Rob Zombie movie, and another for Sheri Moon, 'cos I freaking adore her, so that makes 3/10. Shame, shame, shame."

" What went wrong?
",-0.4767,0.3612,2017-09-12 00:00:00,3,"""31"" is the kind of movie that makes you wonder what went wrong. It seems unlikely the filmmakers were happy with the final product. It's confusing, hard to follow, and the pacing is all messed up. It feels like it's probably missing scenes that would have explained key details, or given us time to catch up and actually care about what we're seeing.The plot is something to do with a group of people traveling in a camper van in the '70s when they get kidnapped by a murderous group of side show freaks and forced to play some kind of survival game.Apparently this group of people are carnival workers themselves, though I missed where that was explained. Aside from Sheri Moon Zombie none of the characters make any impression anyway. One of them looks so much like a young Sid Haig you wonder why the man himself wasn't cast.The movie has one great moment, and that's the very beginning. Richard Brake, a great discovery of Zombie's, breaks (no pun intended) the fourth wall and I had the uncanny sensation he really was talking to me. I can't remember that happening in a movie before.Apparently this movie was crowd-funded ""twice"". Perhaps that is a sign that something went wrong behind the scenes. Did they run out of money the first time?"
" I liked it
",0.4215,0.9841,2017-09-10 00:00:00,7,"It was what I've come to expect from a Zombie film. I actually like the things that most people don't like about his movies. I like the old school actors. I like that he writes movies resembling 70's B movies and that they have that grind house feel to them. It's no secret that he loves horror movies and he incorporates that love of the genre, while pleasing his target audience who love them as well. Everyone seemed to like Doomhead and I did as well. However, Sickhead was my favorite. Understanding the language, I loved his dialogue and his taunting, basically being sort of a bad a** regardless of size (just to be clear, not his wardrobe, just dialogue). SMZ was not annoying and doing some good work without over doing it. If I had to chose, this would be some of her better work since Halloween (and not 2)! I would have preferred more blood and gore, which I've come to expect from RZ, and for that, I knocked down my score just a tad. I heard there were several cuts made for rating purposes and I would rather enjoy seeing the movie again without the cuts. Overall, I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviews and was able to see it for myself. I wasn't disappointed. It's not The Devils Rejects, but it was still a great movie."
" Bare Bones

Say what you will about the studios, but they do insist upon a sense of structure that this movie is lacking."
" My Favorite Rob Zombie Movie To-Date
",-0.1531,0.989,2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie! The characters were regular people that anyone one of us would know, work with and be friends with. The 70's retro touches were great and exactly what I remembered the 70's looking like. Sheri Moon Zombie has really upped her acting game from when I first saw her in House of 1000 Corpses. She did a great job in Halloween, and was even better in The Lord's of Salem and now in this role really shows off her abilities. She makes the transition of her character from the opening to the end result natural and believable. I like that these friends and co-workers don't turn on each other as they do in so many other movies where people are put into these situations. They always turn on each other and it's every man for themselves. They worked together, they fought together. I love that Rob Zombie uses the same actors in his films. Seeing them play different parts is always really interesting. To be honest I loved the fact the women were kick butt in this film. They weren't super heroes, they were just regular women put in a terrible situation that rose to the occasion. The men weren't assholes or macho jerks. They looked out for the women where they could, because that's what good men do, but they weren't getting in the way of each other either. They played to their strengths. Tanks up front, light fighters coming up behind. It made sense. I think that's what really strikes me about this movie the most. I wasn't yelling at the screen because the characters were doing something stupid. Their actions made sense to me, were things I could see myself doing. (Not that I want to ever find myself in that situation.) Richard Brake's performance was amazing. I found him both interesting and terrifying at the same time. Really, all of the actors did an amazing job. There's not a single performance that I thought was sub-par. I recommend watching this movie, especially if you're a Rob Zombie fan, but even if you're not, it's a good movie and definitely worth taking the time for."
" Not as bad as everyone else seems to think
",0.431,0.9708,2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"I really don't understand all the negative reviews for this movie. I suppose I should start with full disclosure - I am a Rob Zombie fan. I don't love everything he does - I hated ""The Lords of Salem"" - but I've enjoyed everything else the man has done. When I first read about this movie, I was apprehensive, after i found Rob's previous film was not to my liking at all. Add in some of the things that I read on IMDb after ""31"" was released, and I had already made up my mind that I was going to be disappointed. Then, I sat down to watch ""31"". To say that I was pleasantly surprised is a serious understatement. I had read that the characters were unlikable, but on the contrary I found myself cheering for them unreservedly. I had read that the film was misogynistic, but I thought that the females were portrayed as competent, strong heroines. I had read that the dialogue was bad, but I found that the words coming out of the characters mouths were believable and, when appropriate, either hilarious or riveting. Granted, this movie probably isn't for everyone - if the female form bothers you, or if you find violence distasteful, then you should steer clear. On the other hand, if you like bloodshed or you enjoy cheering on some regular people who are placed in terrible circumstances, or even if you're just a fan of tense thrillers, then this movie is for you. Rob Zombie has written and directed perhaps his finest movie with ""31"", and I hope that more people will give this underrated gem a chance."
" A bit different for a Rob Zombie Movie
",-0.5574,0.2028,2017-07-17 00:00:00,7,"There are a lot of negative reviews for this film; it may be because it is quite different from Zombie's normal formula which he basically turns on it's head.A group of carnival workers are en route travelling in a van; they come across some strange scarecrows blocking their path and stop to tear them down. They get ambushed, violently attacked, kidnapped and dumped in a deserted factory. A peculiar group of posh old people tell the carni's that they are there to play a game - the game of 31 which occurs once a year. They have 12 hours to survive and win the game. Amongst them in the factory are numerous psycho killers that are there to viciously kill them all.I enjoyed this movie, it's very 70's stylised in the way it is filmed, the costumes and scenery. The characters are great, typical of Rob Zombies usual pattern. I was really pleased to see Sherri Moon Zombie and Meg Foster there. The baddies are fantastic, I love them, all vicious, crazy and quirky. The settings, colours, camera- work and imagery are very individual to Zombie's style. It is a festival for the eyes. There are a lot of close up shots in this movie that some people don't like but I found it new and something different.This film is extremely violent and gory, full on graphic blood and guts. There are a lot of cringe moments. The special effects are amazing.The actors in this film are superb, the whole cast are believable, likable and give their all. Richard Brake is outstanding and will no doubt have a cult following for his portrayal of Doom-head.I would personally recommend this movie, if you're an avid horror fan it's a must to add to your list."
" Not everyone on the planet has the same taste for everything!!!
",0.0,0.9979,2017-07-15 00:00:00,10,"A movie I've been waiting and wanting for ages, written and directed by a brave master of horror and cinema, My Hero Mr. Rob Zombie. It's up there with my other favorite films of his which are, ""House of 1000 Corpses"", ""The Devil's Rejects"", ""Halloween II"", and ""The Lords of Salem"". An old school 70's solid grind-house horror with a simple plot, which is made in the style of the master himself, with its vibes from ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" and more of ""The Devil's Rejects"", combined in one extremely epic way. It takes place back in year 1976 and it's about a group of carnival workers who get kidnapped on Halloween night. They're thrown into an abandoned warehouse, and forced to play a game called 31, defending themselves against a bunch of psychotic killers dressed up as clowns for 12 hours, and their only chance for survival is to kill or get killed. It's an insanely intense bloody carnival ride of a feature that will leave you with nonstop shocking scenes of murder, mayhem, madness, vulgarity, lots of dark humor, and it's all very well executed in a completely hectic and energetic mode which is bold, brilliant, and just a whole lot of fun. The makeup effects are fantastic and the fight scenes are really brutal, along with just about everything in this film. It's all very realistic, and if you actually pay attention, it feels like you're in the movie yourself. You've got a league of massive icons, major veterans, and newcomers bringing these amazing characters to life. The awesome score has it's vibes from classic 70s and 80s horror scores, and as always, from a Rob Zombie film, the soundtrack is filled with super golden oldies.As a horror fan, I'm always rooting for the villains, but in this feature, the good characters are bad-asses, too, and it's really a tough choice for me to root for sides. Sheri Moon Zombie's performance as Charley is extremely impressive. At first her character is weak and girlish, but as she fights from one level to another for survival with her team of carnies, she gains more resiliency and transforms into more of a warrior. The Iconic Meg Foster as Venus is the toughest and wisest of them all; believe it or not, you'll get to see her wielding a chainsaw against a maniac, and she really looks great for her age, too. I really loved Roscoe, played by Jeff Daniel Phillips, who's more of a bad-ass in the entire team of carnies; he's a fighter and he never quits. EG Daily's character as Sexhead is the hottest + craziest killer clown you will ever see, with her sweet voice and her jaw dropping looks will definitely thrill the audience. I would definitely love to see a movie mainly about E.G.'s character. Another interesting character who's movie I would love to see is... the sickest and scariest character of them all, who starts off the movie with his mind-blowing speech and later on steals the entire show. This man may look like a clown, with his grease painted makeup; but trust me, folks, this chaotic individual ain't no clown, and he definitely ain't no Joker clowning around from the Batman Universe; he ain't playing around when it comes to his job. A new face of horror which is truly iconic is finally here and he is known as Doomhead, played by Richard Brake, who's performance is extremely phenomenal. I believe Richard badly needs an Oscar for his role as Doomhead, the greatest performance I've ever seen in a long time.I've been wondering why there are bad reviews for a movie like this. Well, I guess the audience nowadays are mostly into horror films in the mainstream world which are being too friendly with PG13 ratings and CGI effects or whatever. I, on the other hand, will never waste my time doing negative reviews, because I know everything isn't easy to do in life and not everyone on the planet has the same taste for everything. Some of the audience were expecting it to be more gory, but they forget that it's because of the MPAA, why we never really get to see the NC17 version of ""31"". I really hope the uncut version will be available on home video someday, though I'm still happy that at least we got to see this Rated R version of ""31"". I've been a fan of Rob Zombie's movies since I was a kid and this man has never disappointed me in any of his works and till this very day, he's always passionate for the horror genre. He's not doing it for the fame or making number 1 movies at the box office; he's actually doing it for his fans, and I'm proud to say that I'm one of them. When I saw ""31"" for the very first time, I was just blown away from start to finish as it was so good, I had to watch it over and over again. It's kinda strange, too, because whenever I watch it, I feel there's a lot of positive and inspirational messages I get from this movie, and there's a really powerful message at the ending which is pretty similar to ""The Devil's Rejects"" and it's one of the best endings I've ever seen in a long time."
" A Totally Average Slasher Flick
",0.0,-0.8673,2017-07-12 00:00:00,5,"If it hadn't been for The House Of A 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects, and The Haunted World Of El Superbeasto then I would not have watched this movie, especially after what Rob Zombie did to the Halloween movies. Unfortunately, this is not as good as his earlier works.This is just another load of people who are captured, tortured, and killed for pleasure. What Zombie adds to the story is a triumvirate of puppet masters - Father Murder (Malcolm McDowell), Sister Serpent (Jane Carr), and Sister Dragon (Judy Geeson) - who run The Murderworld where they run a torturous gauntlet of games. The triumvirate gives their prisoners twelve hours to survive the trials they have arranged for them. Each trial is to survive the psychopaths they send in dressed as clowns.However, most of this doesn't work. My heart started to sink when the group of carnies are talking about the rides and attractions that they run, though their RV isn't towing anything and there's no lorry travelling with them. Then you learn they're travelling with a fair, yet again there are no other vehicles. It's these little things which annoy, and there are quite a few throughout the film. For such an unoriginal story ironing out ALL the kinks would have made it stronger.As for the direction, it's pretty standard stuff though Zombie does try to add a little art to the affair by working in vivid colours. This isn't fully utilised due to the average camera work. There's also an alarming lack of suspense and tension, which a film of this type really requires. That said there are a couple of nice scenes with Richard Brake, who plays Doom-Head, where the close ups are so sharp and crisp. This brilliantly captures his Brake's magnificent rendition of his psychopath character. To be honest, it's Brake that steals this film. This actor should be used more often, he has some serious skills. As for the rest of the cast, they are okay, none of them particularly stands out. I would've liked more details in both the story and characterisations of the triumvirate as this was a missed opportunity to add a spooky and eerie element. Also the other clowns - heads - aren't anywhere nearly as disturbing or sinister as Brake's Doom-Head. The brothers Schizo and Psych-Head, played by David Ury and Lew Temple, are your routine slashers, complete with chainsaws. Though it's Sick-Head which lets the film down. This is not due to Pancho Moler playing the part, on the contrary, his acting is pretty solid. It's down to Zombie dressing him as a Hitleresque character - complete with swastikas and moustache. I'm sorry but I think if anybody was confronted by him they would probably die laughing.Then there's the name of the movie... 31. This actually references Halloween and is another missed chance to tie the games into Samhain or another ""Dark"" holiday, which would have made the story stronger.This is an average film which has a few small drawbacks and a couple of benefits that levels the film to average, once again. If you're a Rob Zombie fan then you may like this. If it's cold and wet outside you could turn off the lights and settle back with this slasher flick, it's worth at least one viewing."

",-0.6996,-0.6114,2017-07-06 00:00:00,6,"This was a good movie. I tried watching it the first time, and the diversity of the characters and the monotonous plot of characters running from their captors really made me turn it off. However, in my second viewing, I was surprised by my lack of trust in Mr. Rob Zombie. I think the ending may have solidified this as a good addition to the director's filmography. The killer in the white face paint is a pretty damn good villain! The story is simple. Circus employees get captured, and are sent to a place where the game is for them to stay alive. All of them die slowly, except the blonde, who wins the game just as the ""guy in the white face paint"" is about to kill her. Let me just end this review by saying that the guy in the white face paint is the man.6 Stars"

",-0.4939,-0.9312,2017-07-05 00:00:00,6,"While I don't think its as bad as as most people seem to be voting this movie, its far from good. Its your typical, run of the mill ""people locked in a building and have to escape while getting hunted down by psychopathic killers dressed as midget zombies, clowns or the joker out of batman armed with chainsaws, knives and big sticks"" film.Its OK(ish) in all honesty, much better than Lords of Salem not as good as House of 1000 Corpses or Devils rejects - horror has become a very disappointing genre, there have been very, very few notable horror movies released in the last decade and this is no exception, just more fodder for the bargain bin."
" Why does Zombie write the dialogue?
",0.0,-0.6249,2017-06-18 00:00:00,2,"The good: The lighting, sets, music, costumes, makeup, and some actors. Honestly, I think that zombie does a great job when it comes to the setup and design of his movies. The worlds he creates in his films are strange and they feel normal in their own realm. Some movies can't capture a feel for their environment and it feels out of place. In this movie, the film's environment is believable. The actors interact with that environment in a reasonable way. The costumes, makeup, and lighting works for the movie. All in all, this is the best part about the film. The bad: Script, Dialogue, and acting.Rob Zombie has a fetish for extreme vulgarity in language. This would be fine if it were confined to one or two characters. He makes it a standard for all his characters which is the problem. When Sherri Moon zombie kills the midget (sorry, no PC here), she stops and says ""where the f* is my bat?"" That's reasonable because of the situation. When she starts to flirt with the gas station attendant, it's unreasonable and it doesn't make sense. She even grabs the guys crotch because... you know... Women do that all the time (sarc). This has always been Rob Zombie's weakness. He writes terrible dialogue which destroys the film. Richard Brake is awesome in general. You don't need him sticking a finger under meg foster's nose talking about the chick he just had sex with. On top of that, Why show him screw the chick only to comment in more vulgarity. Less is more Rob. I saw the movie for free. I don't think I'd watch it again."

",-0.5574,-0.9974,2017-05-29 00:00:00,3,"Rob Zombie knows no restraint. His directing style was ill-suited for a remake of Carpenter's methodical Halloween; a better fit for his own properties. Even then, I wonder if he hasn't spent his effectiveness.31 will ultimately be compared to movies like The Running Man and Battle Royale. It won't last in anyone's memory as long, however. The overly familiar premise is an excuse for gore and vile antics, but Zombie tries so desperately to shock that it's aggravating to watch. ""Sex and death are on their way,"" says Malcolm McDowell, in character. That sums up the entire movie. To be fair, Zombie isn't attempting high art, but when you begin a movie with a Kafka quote it only accentuates the lack of depth found thereafter.The opening scene drones with the duration of a Tarantino monologue, and none of the wit or tension. At least it is a showpiece for actor Richard Brake, giving his all as the villainous Doom-Head; wasted on tedious dialogue. We proceed to meet the main cast, a circus troupe crowded into a van in search of a place to set up their act. The characterization is thin and the humor embarrassingly overt. Yeah, yeah – everyone's genitals are sopping wet or ready to burst. Someone failed to realize that the quiet moment where one of these characters sits eating popcorn while wearing a gorilla mask is more amusing than a ceaseless stream of dick jokes.Before long, this lot is waylaid by men in clown masks and taken as prisoners. Some of them are immediately killed because they're even less interesting than those who are inducted into a sadistic game of life and death by a group of aristocrats in powdered wigs, played charmingly by their English actors (which includes Malcolm McDowell, whom I already mentioned). What ensues is predictable, one-note sadism sprawled out via Nazi imagery, numerous mentions of rape, and unrestrained violence. I don't condemn the use of any of these atrocities in a film, I question why the execution feels so disingenuous in this particular film.I guess my expectations are too high, considering such enriching dialogue as, ""we're gonna f*** all your holes."" And the fact that a couple minutes later I was treated to a reiterative list of each hole to be f***ed. I know it's asking a lot, but was no one available to proofread the script? ""You're falling for her,"" does not mean you're falling for her lies, it implies love. ""I certainly hope we'll see a better showing from the remaining remnants."" Excuse me, but a remnant is already, by definition, a thing that remains.I don't want to talk about the characters. Rather, I can't. There aren't any. Just an indistinct, soulless mass, sticky with blood and semen, dragged to its lousy death by a lazy puppeteer.You might find pleasure in fetishized violence; admittedly, the special effects are above average. Maybe you also fancy shameless perversion and wish you'd painted the entrance of your home to look like a vagina and crowned it with a neon sign that reads: ""wet kitty.""Horror need not be subtle but it absolutely must fulfill what it aims to achieve. Horrific? Savage? Only half-heartedly. Rob Zombie has no apparent interest in new tricks, regardless of how transparent his technique has become. 31 is a miserable film, never as ""cool"" as it pretends to be. Built exclusively on cheap thrills. Too bad I wasn't thrilled.Verdict: Not For Me, Maybe For YouFor more horror review check out http://unsleepinghorror.com/"
" there was one point where I had hope...
",0.0,0.9117,2017-04-25 00:00:00,5,"It's a small budget, so I give him a bit of a pass on that and for what it's worth, there was a small moment--when the ""less"" bad guys start to get the jump on the others--where I thought it might be able to pull itself around, but no...There's a ""Running Man"" theme to it all that wasn't fully explored. The ending, also, leaves much to be desired. The lighting as well. Disco lights mostly, not a fully formed concept.I hope he keeps making movies though, just that they're better than this one."
" Not Zombie's greatest film, but far from being his worse.
",-0.7457,-0.9792,2017-04-23 00:00:00,6,"Rob Zombie's movies can be at best disturbing, brutal and deliciously entertaining, and at worst annoying, goofy and tedious. The films House of 1,000 Corpses and it's sequel The Devils Rejects perfectly show off the best and worst of Zombie's filmmaking. I found House of 1,000 Corpses to be shrill and irritating from beginning to end, with not enough gore or tension to make the watch bearable. The Devil's Rejects is the polar opposite. It's gritty, disgusting and thrilling, with characters that I previously couldn't be interested less in suddenly becoming fascinating. 31 has traits from both The Devil's Rejects and House of 1,000 Corpses, and what Zombie pulls together is a mixed, yet entertaining, watch. The story is very Zombie-esque, following a group of carnies who are kidnapped by rich people who bet on their lives as round after round of murderous clowns attack them. The premise itself is enough to show up in the theater, and the film definitely starts out promisingly with a creepy black and white monologue from the scariest killer of the bunch, Doom Head. The intensity of that scene doesn't exactly carry through for the rest of the film, and neither does the quality of cinematography. Zombie takes on a shaky, hand-held look that occasionally undermines some potentially great scenes of horror, but it's no where near the worst shaky cam I've ever seen, and it also sometimes works to the film's benefit. Where Zombie excels, and lords over some of his horror peers (Cough cough Eli Roth), is in the visceral horror department. He knows how to make your stomach drop to the floor. The Devil's Rejects is one long experiment in viscerally disgusting horror, and that's part of what makes it so great. There are definitely some great moments of visceral horror in this film that I won't spoil.My biggest problems with the film have to do with the way it resolved, and some of our main characters. It leaves you feeling a bit unsatisfied at the end, and wishing for a more epic-ly gory finish to such a continuously violent movie. Our main characters aren't exactly likable, especially Sheri Moon Zombie's, who hasn't been exactly great in a Zombie movie since The Devil's Rejects, where she had the right balance of shrill and psycho, and none of them are really fleshed out in any way. It makes me wish a little that Rob Zombie would try using characters who aren't carnies for once. All in all, I was entertained throughout the duration of this film. Is it great? Nu-uh, but it's still a fun, if flawed, addition to the Zombie canon. Keep it up Rob!"
" Just another Halloween
",0.0,0.5976,2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"Obviously the title is a give away, though I'm not sure if Rob meant to riff on his critics or was just exclaiming his love for the last day in October. Whatever the case is, this movie is mental to say the least. Just the beginning alone which sets the mood should tell you so. Is it something you want to watch? Are you ready for this? The answer lies within yourself.Richard Brake is phenomenal in this, although he's not playing the main role, he does steal the show (no pun intended). Some may call this a return to form for Rob Zombie, but then again he does seem to tend to love making movies like that anyway (small budget, very violent, over the top and offensive). If that's not your cup of tea, don't watch it, plain and simple. This is not a masterpiece, it is violent, anarchic, fun splatter all the way. Enjoy it for what it is then"
" It has Rob Zombie's signature all over
",-0.5574,-0.7471,2017-03-30 00:00:00,6,"When I saw the credits in the beginning of the movie and I saw that it was a movie by Rob Zombie I immediately knew it was going to be a bit psycho, weird and violent. Nothing wrong with that if you like those kind of movies. The story is not very far fetched but which one is in this genre? It's all about the gore and the violence anyway. The different psychos are really well done and will scare more than one. So if creepy clowns are the thing that you're afraid of than you will be served. There is a lot of bloody gory scenes so don't watch this movie if you don't like that kind of stuff. Malcolm McDowell has a smaller part in the movie so don't expect A Clockwork Orange performance. In conclusion, if you like gore and Rob Zombie you won't be disappointed, if you don't like that then just pass on this one."
" What The Heck?
",0.0,-0.9936,2017-03-17 00:00:00,5,"This is not even a half movie watch. I turned it off it is so bad. Not even 1 star movie. Should be a negative 100 rating. How did this even get a 5? Rob Zombie is drugged up again while directing. Sherri is terrible.Every single character or actor is the ugliest you would ever see in any movie at all. Boring, dull, slow, bad camera, acting, and everything you can think of is bad about this movie. I thought Troll 2 was the worst of all movies until I saw 30 minutes of this one.Black guy gets killed and he is stabbed like 30 times and takes him by in movie time 2 hours to die. LOL! WTH? They have 12 hours to play a game called 31. Stupid movie and they are not even clowns or even look like them in the movie.Nazi wannabe killers that make it like they are clowns but are nothing but ugly freaks that just like playing a never heard before game. Zombie has gone bonkers and has no clue how to be a normal person anymore.His wife is so bad at acting. He does massive close ups of her eyes and face for no reason at all. Shaky camera and not even found footage. Just in a half hour and I can so much of this movie is bad. I could go forever.Never going to recommend this to anyone, it is so bad. I love horror movies but this is not really horror, and not really comedy or could be comedy but so bad it is not funny. More annoying to watch than anything.Only reason I wanted to see this was because I heard or read online before release that it was being rated as NC-17 and Rob Zombie had to cut stuff out to get an R rating. Well, he should of cut it all and never released it.Not one of the actors was good in the movie. Feel sorry for them all that wanted to be in it. Oh well, and I also feel sorry for those who actually enjoyed it. Good luck weirdos that like it."
" Spoilers follow ...
",0.0,-0.9834,2017-03-16 00:00:00,3,"He gets a lot of stick for his style of horror films, does Rob Zombie. It is heartening in many ways, to find he appears not to care, and continues to release projects in his own raw, coarse style. It is no surprise to find wife Sheri Moon pretty central to the plot here; no surprise either that she goes through a pretty punishing time.She (as Charly), alongside a Carnival van-load of other horny, chain-smoking Rob Zombie (RZ) staples, find their rock'n'roll lifestyle interrupted by a gang of organised game-hunters who insist they play the game of '31' (this is set in the 1970s when a rock and roll lifestyle actually existed). Zombie stalwarts Malcolm McDowell and Judy Geeson star alongside veteran Jane Carr as the powdered and coiffured ringleaders of these 'games', seemingly set in some improbable palace with an interior comprised of dripping corridors and warehouse-sized killing grounds.The killers are lazily-named Sick-Head and Doom-Head etc. Schizo, Psycho, Death and Sex make up some of the other Heads. All unable to growl through a sentence without at least a handful of 'f*****g's' therein, they present a destructive, unhinged ensemble not dissimilar in personality from our alleged heroes. Pretty soon, we are knee-deep in campy, OTT gore, shrieking and black, tar-like blood, where the identity of the characters all melt into a melee, and come a distant second to the graphic killings. I certainly have no problem with this if in the right mood, just as I had no problem with RZ's re-imagining of the 'Halloween' franchise – those films remain underrated in my view. Equally, his earlier 'The Devil's Rejects (2005)' is somewhat over-rated, and it is this film with which Zombie compares '31'.The problem with this for me is, after a while it ceases to shock and just becomes monotonous. Even the introduction of a German-growling fellow in a tutu attempting to club someone to death isn't as much fun as it sounds. All the characters seem to have the same character, any lines are screamed and littered with so many profanities it goes beyond parody, and everything  just is. There is no lead-up to speak of, each violent act is loud, in your face and the familiarity with this repeated approach quickly wears thin.I enjoy RZ films for their mad violence, wall-to-wall grotesques and graphic horror, but when that's all there is, the results are a little wearing, but too loud to allow you to drift off."
" In Hell, Everybody Loves Popcorn
",-0.2263,0.9911,2017-03-14 00:00:00,7,"""In hell, everybody loves popcorn.""This film released digitally six months ago, and since then, I've seen it five times. Is it because it's Rob Zombie's best film? No. It's not. But is it a fun time? Absolutely.As for the story, it's pretty simple. Five friends get trapped in a game of 31 and have to fight their way out to survival. It's not complex at all, but who said it has to be? I enjoyed the story a lot, because I like survival horror.The characters are not all like-able. I'll give it that at least. The three that stand out to me are Charly (played by Sheri Moon Zombie herself), Venus (Meg Foster), and Doomhead (Richard Brake). Charly and Venus are just a couple of bada** babes, and I completely root for them the entire film! (Yay for girl power.) As for Doomhead, he is one scary guy that I wouldn't want to make mad. The opening scene with him was unquestionably fantastic.Was the film memorable? Some parts of it. Like I mentioned above, Richard Brake's opening scene was fantastic.How was the dialogue? It's not good. Even as a Zombie fan girl, I am willing to admit that he went too heavy on the ""wh*re"" and ""sh*t"" jokes. I know that he is perfectly capable of writing better films than this one. It was a little bit of a let down, but not enough to ruin the film for me.Overall, I liked 31. It's not my favorite from Zombie, but it's also not my least favorite. I hope you enjoyed my review and thanks for reading!"
" A mashup of Zombie's greatest hits.
",0.6369,-0.9542,2017-03-10 00:00:00,8,"You've gotta hand it to Rob Zombie: no matter how many complaints he gets about his tropes, the man uncompromisingly refuses to alter his style and continues to churn out tonally similar films as a F.U. to those who bash anything with his name on it. The man has shown he has zero you-know-whats to give when it comes to his ""haters"" and, over a decade and 6 films into his career, you should know by now whether he's your cup of tea.""31"" continues to expand on the ""white trash horror"" trope we've all come to expect from Mr. Zombie, focusing almost as a showcase for his greatest hits, if you will. There's the repulsive characters with foul mouths who look like they haven't bathed in five years, the grimy sets, the over-the-top gore, a pulsing soundtrack evened out with some 70s rock hits, shaky cam, extreme close-ups, his wife, 8mm-style footage...name anything in more than one of his films and it's here.This time around we get: the sheer insanity and crazy kaleidoscopic colors of ""House of 1000 Corpses"", the grittiness and desert locations of ""The Devil's Rejects"", the violence of his ""Halloween"" films, and the lens flares and stylish shots from ""The Lords of Salem"", which Zombie has thankfully chosen to revisit here on a few occasions. Oh, and it all takes place on...Halloween! Like I said, this literally plays out like a ""Best Of"" showcase incorporating elements from all of his previous films. Given that, there's something that should be obvious by now: if you didn't care for any of his previous films, your mind still won't be swayed by this one. But that's the beauty of it for his fans: they know what to expect and Rob continues to deliver it.I would argue that this film is well-directed and I imagine that would elicit a few shocks, but so what? The truth of the matter is that Rob has visited these streets so often that it should be clear by now he knows exactly what he's doing. The man overwhelmingly makes a particular style of film--one many people fail to connect with--and I would argue he does it well. Over the years, he has managed to create a style all his own, to the point I'd argue anyone familiar with horror would be able to pick out a Rob Zombie film if it didn't have his name on it. That's the beauty of directors like Argento, Zombie, Bava, Tarantino, etc.: that even if you don't like their work, you can almost immediately identify it. Some may balk at me lumping him in with those greats, but tell me, how many modern horror directors have such a distinct style associated with them that you can actually pick them out from the herd of other horror directors all making endless cookie cutter mainstream fare? For every James Wan, there's directors making jump-scare films with no personality to them--faceless directors you wouldn't be able to distinguish between had the credits not told you. Zombie, love him or hate him, does not fall into that category.Is this a perfect film? No. As usual, Rob's dialogue remains his weakest link in the creative chain, but his visuals remain spot-on. Oh, it's all shaky cam, you say? Nonsense. He has developed a distinct use of color and utilizes his aspect ratio admiringly well on some shots, showing he CAN make a conventional ""beautiful"" horror film should he want to--and indeed ""The Lords of Salem"" is the closest he's ventured in that direction--but, for most of the running time, chooses to disorient the viewer with crazy angles, hellish images, and the always-present feeling of being dirty. I still can't watch a Rob Zombie film without wanting to shower afterwards.What did I enjoy about this one? I loved the pacing, I dug the 70s tracks and the thumping music during the suspenseful bits, I appreciated his willingness to revisit the beautiful lens flares and stylish shots from ""The Lords of Salem"", I admired the desert scenery and the homages to his past work (the abduction scene is immediately reminiscent of the one in ""House of 1000 Corpses"") and I thought his long takes of dialogue and close-ups really fleshed out his style on this one.For those that care, there's also a definite ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" vibe going on here that I dug.So non-fans, sorry: this isn't the one that will sway you and it's looking increasingly unlikely that film will ever come unless Rob completely alters his approach. For those that enjoyed his past work (even just one of them), there may be something for you here.Keep on rockin', Mr. Zombie. I can always count on you to put on a good show. In the theater, of course. I haven't listened to your music..."
" Hunger Games meets Hostel
",-0.25,0.7923,2017-03-07 00:00:00,9,"So I've read a lot of bad reviews hating on Rob Zombie. I almost listened to them and passed on watching this flick. Im glad I didn't listen. The movie was not thick in layers of plot however the action and gore were perfect for a horror flick, reminds me of when I was a kid when horror movies were actually interesting. All actors were superb with the exception of Sheri Moon-Zombie she was kinda lame in this (She usually does decent) other than that Doom-Head is amazing, could kinda see him playing Joker better than Leto. I think this is a step up from House of 1000 Corpses seemed to flow better. Don't pass on this if you want to see a gore flick, don't go into this expecting an Oscar performance and you will be pleased."
" Another ""Phone-In"" Attempt
",0.0,-0.6998,2017-03-05 00:00:00,1,"I have been a fan of Rob Zombie for many years. When I watched ""House of 1000 Corpses"" for the first time, I loved it. As soon as ""The Devil's Rejects"" came out, I thought that it was great and lived up to its predecessor. His renditions of ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II"" were good, but that's when it the greatness disappears. ""The Lords of Salem"" was downright ridiculous. Now there's ""31."" What is there to say? All the while I was watching it, I was just shaking my head. As the title of my summary states, this was another ""phone-in"" attempt, almost as though Rob simply stopped trying. When it comes to writing certain things, I am never at a loss for words. In this case, I am. To put it mildly without giving too much away, there was no set solution. When it came to music, Rob was good up to a point. Same thing with his movies. After watching an abomination like this, I am still shaking my head about whether or not I still want to remain loyal to his work."
" I love 31!
",0.6696,0.4638,2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"I'm a huge fan of Rob Zombie's music and his films. It's true that he isn't everyone's cup of tea. I would definitely say that this film is a must-see for his fans and for fans of the horror genre. I encourage everyone to give it a chance, rather than trusting in reviews from all of the haters. As a Rob fan, I was ecstatic from the moment the film was announced. Even with my expectations very high, I wasn't even slightly disappointed. I love grindhouse films, and 31 is an excellent example of grindhouse cinema. It's true, the characters aren't as memorable as some in his past films, but they were all characters that I found myself rooting for. The killers were all very well portrayed and disturbing, and I'm personally not even afraid of clowns. The setting was perfection and it helped create the dark, creepy atmosphere throughout the entire film. The only thing I wish the film had more of was the aristocrats. I doubt there will be a sequel, but if there is, I hope we see a little more of them and a little more of what they experience during the game (bets, favorite killers, reasons for participating in 31, etc). Rob stayed true to himself, and created a film that is twisted, disturbing, and 100% entertaining from beginning to end. I love this film! I own it on Blu-ray and I've already watched it a multitude of times. Don't listen to the bad reviews! Give 31 a chance! A majority of recent horror films are disappointing and try way too hard to be edgy, gritty, and everything else that this film effortlessly is."
" Zombie knows his Horror but he is an awful screenwriter
",-0.7469,-0.4359,2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"'31' is the latest from Rob Zombie and if you know him you know what he does. It bears all the hallmarks, extremely creepy imagery, clever homage to (better) horror films, a nice retro feel and a terrible script. Zombie has talent as a director. He has a style that is uniquely his and his movies do invoke a sense of dread. The problem is he absolutely cannot write any sort of dialogue. It's no surprise that Zombie does follow the formula of the slasher here. The problem is you have to relate to the sacrificial lambs on some sort of level. I didn't really. Zombie's dialogue is at it;s best inorganic and at it's worst migraine inducing. So much filthy disgusting language and I am not a prude whatsoever. I actually do swear quite a bit. I don't mind filthy language in movies but Zombie has no rhyme, reason, or poetry to it. It's like a ten year old kid who has just learned to say ****.That being said I still think the movie has it's moments. He can generate suspense and he can cast his films very well(aside from his wife in the lead role) The highlight of the film is Richard Brake as the demented clown Doom-head. It is one of the best performances I've seen in a horror film in a long time. I say this and I don't even know if the material he is delivering is as bad as the other stuff. He has a manic energy and intensity. The character is despicably cruel but I couldn't keep away. He isn't humorous really but he's unpredictable and each line deliver is grim. Like I said I don't know if the material is any good. I imagine Zombie was writing Manson-esque gibberish but you feel intimidated to the core by this character and Brake's performance.A very mild recommendation. I would love to see Zombie direct a script he didn't write. I think it would be his best film yet. At the very least I'm concerned/intrigued to see his next film, an adaptation of 'Raised Eyebrows' the story of Groucho Marx's last years"
" Splatter matter mishmash.
",0.0258,-0.5446,2017-02-19 00:00:00,3,"Last night I watched Rob Zombie's new movie '31' so you don't have to. I'm a caring kind of guy and I don't like people being hurt! It's one of the most badly acted, jarringly edited and poorly scripted pieces of work I've seen for quite a while. None of the characters deserve any shred of compassion or care from the viewer, there is a laughable paucity of back story, good dialogue and tension. It's just a masturbatory mishmash of slice and dice mayhem, chicks in peril, butch guys trying to be heroes whilst bleeding out that we've all seen so many times before. The trailer for the movie is infinitely more satisfying than the film itself because of its brevity. There is only one sequence that gives off any unsettling power and that is the opening black and white monologue mainly to camera by an actor named Richard Brake( Batman Begins, Kingsman:The Secret Service, Hannibal Rising etc.) playing a character called Doom- Head (!) It's seriously disturbing! After that it's downhill all the way. Chainsaws, blood (lots of it), giggling psychotic clowns, dripping pipes in dark and dank corridors straight out of Cliché City, you know the stuff. Oh and now Malcolm McDowell and his two lady consorts suddenly appear as be-wigged, powdered overseers dressed as characters from a bizarre Restoration comedy piece, who are controlling the 'Game'. WTF?No explanation is given as to why and just when you think things can't get any worse in comes a murderous, knife-wielding small person dressed as Hitler and speaking Spanish! His character is named Sick-Head! Looking back on it now (shudder)I can see that with just a little morsel of humorous imagination from Mr Zombie it could have been a seriously amusing black comedy but it isn't. Shame really, as I liked 'Lords Of Salem'. To be honest, I'm not a fan of most modern so-called Horror Movies, especially ones that star a masked and indestructible sociopath carving up squealing teenies, torture porn or shuffling hordes of the hungry undead eating their way through the population. Don't get me wrong - It's not all doom and gloom for me in the world of cinematic horror, there's good and original work out there like The Autopsy Of Jane Doe, American Mary, Under The Skin, The Descent, The Mist, The Ring, Wolf Creek, 1408, 30 Days Of Night, The Babadook, The first two Hellraiser movies, Sinister, Eden Lake etc. This is just my opinion of course and I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me (fair enough) and enjoy '31'. So, adios lieblings!"

" Good, as a Mr.Zombie-style film.
",0.4404,0.317,2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Hi there ! This film is something : extreme depravity, intense gore, nazi and hillbilly chainsaw-totting clowns, psycho freaks, enraged midget nazi, sick game ball-costumed bourgeois, swearing, cussing (more f bombs than you can muster), racial tones (racism, blacks vs Hitler freaks), blood splashing by the gallons, a real uncomfortable nightmare come true, this is shocking Hardcore R-18 stuff. Not for the faint of heart or people who feel insulted easily.But I was not surprised at all and expected no less from Gorror Gourru the Undead Zombie himself, the very creatively talented director Mr.Zombie (Rob Zombie). The only other one like him is Quentin Tarantino, both are masters of hardgore films; the difference being that Mr.Tarantino deals with real life violence in a more serious way/subject matter is more real and not an over-the-top horror fantasy, even if Mr.Tarantino's characters seem overtly self-aware cartoons of real people (while Mr.Zombie's main protagonist characters (not the cartoon antagonists like in this film (clowns, bourgeois, nazi midgets)) seem more real no matter how screwed up they are).The intro is very disconcerting and awkward : a man stares straight in the camera for 15 minutes long while delivering a big speech (à la Mr.Tarantino) as if he's talking to us the audience, a bloodied face of a clown saying how he intends to make it quick. He says a pretty powerful line that will become a cult line... with a straight face and Coming from a face-painted clown (since clowns are suppose to make you make smile and laugh) :''....I didn't come to make you happy or make your day.......I came to END YOUR LITTLE MISERABLE F...LIFE.''That stuck in my head. As if that clown was talking to me. That was freaky scary.The rest of the film centers around 5 or so characters who are abducted by all costumed psycho clowns into a secret bourgeois' lair to fend off against an onslaught of clown freakazoids in a sort of torture-porn/gore-porn 70s exploitation snuff film trashy way. It's a brutal survival in extreme violence and carnage, it had a very southern hillbilly rednecks 70s 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' feel to it (Mr.Zombie emulates 70s look and the film itself is set in 1976's American Deep South).The protagonists do a good acting job and are natural, the nazi midget's acting is good too, very freaky. As for the British bourgeois they're good too. The other clowns are too, but the best one is definitely the last one with the 2 pocket knives that the protagonists face (it's the same man clown that delivered the 15-min monologue at the intro of the film). Mrs.Zombie does a decent job (Sherri Moon Zombie, Mr.Zombie's wife that partakes as a collaboration in his films as an actress).Sadly, the film is not up to par to Mr.Zombie other films. If you are easily insulted or offended, you are cautioned to not watch this or risk having nightmares. You already know what to expectStill, it's a good film, as a Mr.Zombie film. I give 7.5/10."

Zombie's new film is not supernatural or what I would call a ""slasher""...it's unique and frightening in it's own right. ""31"" could really happen to anyone, anywhere, and at any time. The brutal, psychotic clowns and colonial cult members decide Murder World's rules and your fate. If you give ""31"" a view it's best not to compare to other horror films or even Zombie's other work. Also, to note: Richard Brake gives a terrific performance in this film as ""Doom-Head"" and seeing Malcolm McDowell is always a pleasure."
" Yikes
",0.0,0.942,2017-01-28 00:00:00,5,"I admire Rob Zombie as both a musician and filmmaker.I liked what he did with both of his additions to the Halloween franchise, and his last film, The Lords of Salem was a psychological head trip.His latest film, 31, sounded like a lot of fun despite the semi-tired premise. Sadly, the results are only so-so.The opening scene, mostly comprising a deranged monologue by villain Doom-Head, played with a fearsome malevolence by Richard Brake, is well-shot and offers the audience a lot of promise. Unfortunately, we're then introduced to the protagonists of our story, a group of traveling carnival workers. This rag tag group consists entirely of unlikable assholes. Zombies refusal to provide us with interesting or likable characters makes it almost impossible to care what happens to them in the ensuing bloodbath, thus lessening the scares and intensity.Another quibble of mine is Zombies insistence on casting his wife in every one of his films. She's a good actress, but the nepotism at work distracts me and kind of takes me out of the film. Her performance is good though, so this is probably just a personal nitpick that won't bother anyone else.There are moments of brief and entrancing intensity, such as the chainsaw clowns, but mostly the film is predictable, characters dying one by one until only one remains.The writing isn't top-notch, which means that the fast-paced and frenetic action is really the only entertaining thing about the film.All in all, I found the film disappointing. Zombie has proved that he can do better than this, and I hope his future films are more well put together than this.5/10"

It was basically nonsense with dick/vag jokes tossed in every other minute. The rest will be a brief list of negatives -Cameraman having seizures during action sings -Not killing enemy when he is down -Pointlessly dropping your weapon -Sherri Moon Zombie being.. well... Sherri Moon Zombie -We get it Robb, you like the 1970's confederate south -Weird out of place cliché one liners and quotes by villain -Carnies of the 1970's confederate south had better dental hygiene than we do today.

" Rob shows Hardcore Henry how it's done
",-0.5574,-0.9764,2017-01-21 00:00:00,9,"I should preface this review by confessing I am a little biased, Rob Zombie being my favourite contemporary American horror director. Having said that, this is probably not his best work, but I still consider it high quality stuff. From the initial monologue of killer guru Doom-Head, to the role reverse of Devil's Rejects, where the 2005 slayers fall preys of Mc Dowell and his acolytes mischievous crew. It seems to me that Rob here wanted to strike back at the unwarranted invasion of video games in the horror genre, exemplified by Hardcore Henry in particular, by creating a product with the pace and the villains of a video game and at the same time the cinematic art and the vintage setting of the seventies which you can find in almost all his other movies. The video game part is therefore dependent upon the rules of cinema and not vice versa as in the aforementioned title. The slayers are absolutely great, the nazi Mexican midget being the cherry on top. IMHO I'd give it seven/ eight stars but I added another one desperately trying to boost the rating."
" Rob Zombie should re-watch The Devil's Rejects
",-0.7783,0.991,2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"Dear Rob Zombie, you should re-watch The Devil's Rejects (your one and only masterpiece!) very carefully. It had some of your best writing. I loved the way you handled the character development in that film with short, powerful, funny and even touching scenes. One actually felt affection for the characters even though they were total psychos. The performances were sensational. It wasn't just gore and fancy set pieces and songs and weird characters.You nailed it in the first twenty minutes of 31, Rob. The opening scene was powerful. Richard Brake is a really good actor. The carnival gang was very interesting and I liked the bawdy jokes. The scene at the gas station was very promising. The first twenty minutes had everything one looks for in a Rob Zombie movie - the offbeat characters who are the very opposite of squares, beautiful women who openly flaunt their sexuality and great music (the title sequence was excellent). I think deep in your heart, you are someone who is sick and bored of square society and all its rules. So like William Trevor said ""I get melancholy if I don't write. I need the company of people who don't exist."" Maybe you want friends like the candid characters in 31 and The Devil's Rejects. That's probably why you keep making the same movie over and over.But it all fell apart after the carnival gang gets kidnapped and is pushed into a violent game of survival. While the house where they played the violent game had some amazing set pieces, the writing and the action were completely uninspired. Some of the villains were entertaining, but without proper backstories and character development (like in The Devil's Rejects)they became screaming nobodies. Gore does not shock horror movie fans anymore. I mean, it is impossible to take all the violence in horror movies seriously. We are that desensitized. The film does pick up slightly towards the end thanks to Richard Brake. Elizabeth Daily deserves special mention. She was awesome. I loved her body language and dialog delivery in the scene at the gas station where she tries to seduce Jeff Daniel Phillips. Meg Foster's character could have been one of the greatest redneck female characters of all time. It was a wasted opportunity, frankly.(6/10) because I am a hardcore fan of your movies. Looking forward to the next one, Rob.Best Regards, Pimpin."
" An ugly, cheap version of Suicide Squad
",-0.8316,-0.9716,2017-01-13 00:00:00,4,"You'd have to imagine that Rob Zombie knew Suicide Squad was going to be big in 2016 when he decided to write about a warped tramp in Daisy Dukes with a baseball bat fighting with a meth addict clown with metal teeth. To avoid a lawsuit, he instead borrowed plot elements from The Purge and The Running Man to create a no rules game show where ugly hillbillies, gangbangers and sluts fight other similar people with bad circus makeup. All the characters communicate entirely in the f word, sometimes mixed up with similar words in untranslated Spanish and German. For a fight movie with a pro wrestling sensibility, it works. It's not dull. But that's it. The era and camera work evokes Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but in this version it's like the crazy cannibal family is fighting each other: no heroes, no themes, no messages, not much of interest."
" Rob Zombie just can't do any better
",-0.7189,-0.9916,2017-01-12 00:00:00,2,"What I've learned from this movie is that Rob Zombie has not evolved as a director since 1000 corpses. It's more of the same from his other movies but as the little tricks get old it is also very boring.I think this is the most boring bloody gore movie I have ever seen. Despite the terrifying environment, the classic cat & mouse situation and what else, Zombie manages to create characters nobody cares about. Not if they are victims, killers, getting murdered, escape, die a gory death or get killed off screen. You watch but it just doesn't matter. It is a complete waste of time.The movie drags, seems to go nowhere and then it is over and you realize it really didn't go anywhere at all.Whatever made Zombie movies interesting is now something from the past. In the music business you would call him a one day fly or a one hit wonder. But I don't see any future in Rob Zombie directions anymore."
" let's not pretend it goes beyond pretensions
",0.0762,-0.8372,2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"having recently started rereading EC comics, Eerie, and Creepy, I can't help feeling this is the equivalent of taking an amalgamation of the better black and white carnival stories, doing them in color on glossy*paper, and flogging them off to today's masses who think when you call something a graphic novel it is literature, and that you should have a suitably erudite opinion with lots of run on sentences and no editing. Nope, this is just a damn fine stroke book. Minimum review is ten lines of text, *the spellcheck does not recognize the proper tense of calendar in terms of finishing paper, sentence breaks made to emphasize a phrase are condensed back to a no format base, and yet it is acceptable to violate grammar tense and agreement like holes on a sex doll. How did Doom Head keep an unprotected cigar whole in his back pocket?"
" I dug it
",0.0,-0.9557,2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"31 is more of a return to form for Rob Zombie after the surreal and atmospheric The Lords Of Salem. If you dug House Of 1000 Corpses this should be up your alley. Basically, the film is a old school slasher version of The Running Man. 31, takes place on Halloween in 1976 and is heavily influenced by Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there also are nods to John Carpenter and is very much in a 70's grindhouse style.I can't say I cared for the plight of our ""heroes""/victims much, but one of the things I love about horror is, it is one genre where it is cool to root for the bad guys. There are no doubt some great villains here, Malcolm McDowell, Jane Carr and Judy Geeson are excellent as the hosts of the game. Robert Brake is absolutely brilliant as murder master and all around brutal sadist Doom Head. While I would not regard this is Rob Zombie's best work, as a fan of his films I did enjoy it. There are killer clowns, hippie carnies, macabre extreme violence, black humor and a 70's rock soundtrack taking place one Halloween in the rural southwest. If you are a fan of old school horror you should also enjoy 31."
" VIEWS ON FILM review of 31
",0.0,-0.9932,2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"31 is my latest review. Directed by rocker-turned-shocker Rob Zombie, it's twisted, dark, and bloody. Heck, it's what you've come to expect from the guy whose own childhood involved seeing someone getting their head bashed in at a carnival riot. Zombie goes grainy, using freeze frames and throwing elements from The Running Man, The Warriors, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre into a cinematic blender. This helps him justify 31's running time of 102 minutes. In the Rob Zombie film canon, I would rank this thing higher than The Devil's Rejects but far lower than Zombie's underrated classic, House of 1000 Corpses.Taking place during Halloween (that might be where 31's title came from) and filmed on location in Los Angeles, CA (I thought it was Texas), 31 has all the necessary elements for a Rob Zombie concoction. He loves the 70's so you gotta have the appropriate tunage from that era (""Walk Away"" by the James Gang opens things up). Then you gotta include Zombie's penchant for sadistic violence and cocky torture along with his need to create a funhouse-like atmosphere. Finally, you gotta incorporate the actors/actresses that he likes on his template. Malcolm McDowell, Welcome Back, Kotter's Lawrence Hilton- Jacobs, and Judy Geeson are all featured in 31's supporting roles. Oh yeah, did I mention Rob digs the 1970's? Mmm hmm.Anyway, 31 has a couple of its villains dress up like extras from the period drama, Barry Lyndon. And Zombie's trouper wife (Sherri Moon Zombie) gets to play the protagonist and/or girl in peril for a change. Towards 31's conclusion, she looks like a bloodied up Marilyn Burns from ""Texas Chainsaw"" circa 1974. She appears exhausted and you the viewer might feel the same way (that's exhausted, not elated).The opening ten minutes of 31, involve a few unlikable denizens riding in a bus, chatting about weed and sex and such, and looking for their next gig as full-time carnival workers. These ten minutes are a clear homage to Tobe Hooper's opening sequence a la The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. While they are traveling down a dirt road, they run into a roadblock with what looks like scarecrows and other Halloween-themed structures. As they get out of said bus, they are attacked and taken to a remote building. There, a game is played that will last about twelve hours. The helpless workers are put in rooms that appear to look like mazes. They have to fend off evil characters with names like Sick-Head, Psycho-Head, and Death-Head. Lots of chainsaws, knives, and other weapons are involved in these gladiator-like battles. The Mamas and the Papas, The Wolfman Jack Show, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Lynyrd Skynyrd all play in the background. Oh Rob, you scallywag! Now as mentioned earlier, Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses really shook me upon first viewing. In my book, it remains his best movie to date. Watching ""Corpses"", I realized that Rob Zombie would never make a flick this manically effective ever again. I was right. For various reasons, 31 just doesn't have the same upshot as something like House of 1000 Corpses. Yeah it has nasty dialogue spoken by the antagonists (most of it pertains to rape and assault), lots of decomposed bodies, standard torture porn, and non-stop bloodletting. However, 31 doesn't come off as fresh, or original, or groundbreaking, or radical. Instead, it feels like an excuse for Zombie to make yet another horror vehicle that probably won't get much of a nationwide release anyway. Flaunting his main plot point as a savage game of life or death, Zombie has clearly run out of ideas to make you squirm. And what's worse, he kinda holds back which is rare for the same dude whose bloodcurdling voice belted out ""Thunder Kiss '65"" (ha ha).In conclusion, 31 isn't awful but let's be honest, there's ""31"" reasons to see something else in the fright department. Rating: 2 stars."
" Rob Zombie is one sick individual
",-0.7845,-0.9278,2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Now as someone who isn't a big fan of the horror genre or at least supernatural horror movies I am a bi fan of the saw franchise and those sort of horror movies. Now to get to business, 31 is about a bunch of roadies who play A game of 31 every Halloween . They abduct A group of people and force them to play 31 a game where you have to fight to the death. an interesting take on a not so original story in classic Rob zombie style. If you like Devils rejects you will definitely like this . Very violent and entertaining wish we could get more horror movies like this one. The cast is great like in most of Rob Zomgies movies everyone looks the part . there is no stereo typical pretty boy or even an extremely attractive girl everyone looks normal and fits the part"
" Horrible movie. I was gonna give this a 5 but I gave it a 1 for the strobe light scene.
",-0.3071,-0.9911,2017-01-02 00:00:00,1,I was gonna give this a 5 but I gave it a 1 for the strobe light scene. That really ticked me off and there was nothing emotional or moving about it.I've also read some people have had seizures. Also there was no warning that there was such an awful awful effect. pathetic cheap effect. Why would you put that in a scene knowing some people might have seizures? Even the people that don't have a seizure don't like it. I don't know why but it really ticked me off they did that. It's cheap and dangerous and just made the movie way worse than it already is.Do not waste your time with this movie it's horrible Just had to share my thoughts.
" Better than I expected.
",0.4404,0.8758,2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"After Lords Of Salem, the bar was set pretty low, so, I didn't think this was too bad.The good: The big theater was cool and lit really nice. The three captor characters in the powdered wigs was a nice, creepy touch. Rob Zombie really likes using full frontal nudity a lot now, so, there were young, nude women walking around which is always good.I thought the little person, Nazi guy was gonna be lame, but, when he spoke Spanish, I liked it. It added another layer to the disorientation of his scenes.The music was really good, reminded me of music from The Exorcist and John Carpenter's The Thing.Other reviews said the blood effect looked fake. I thought they were damn good. A lot of the wounds kept bleeding in subsequent shots. I don't know if it was done practical or cgi, but, you don't see that a lot in these movies.The bad: I didn't realize these people worked for a carnival. The dialogue was supposed to explain this, but, it would've been nice to see some shots of a carnival being broke down to go to the next town, or something, and then show the RV with the 31 characters driving away.Sherri is like the same character in any of Rob's movies. I was waiting for her to say, ""Tootie f*ckin' fruitie."" any minute.The sets were lit cool and the the dripping water and filthy floors worked, but, the walls and ceilings looked too clean, except for the bathroom set. Maybe less lighting of the upper areas in the factories would've helped.When they're eating and Charly discovers, I guess, they're eating parts of their dead friend, but, there's no obvious parts of his body missing that would account for the big buffet of food on the table. His legs weren't shown, so, maybe that's where all of the meat came from. LOL The ending was bad. I expected Capt. Spaulding to roll up, ala House Of 1000 Corpses and then Joker Jr. rolls up with some re-recording of Dream On playing. I guess Stephen Tyler did a solo version or something. Anyway, Charly looks like she's about to collapse and suddenly she's ready for a royal rumble with Doomhead? Not buying it.All in all not bad for a low budget flick, but, I hope Zombie does something on par with Devil's Rejects or a really cool remake, like, Soylent Green or Logan's Run."
