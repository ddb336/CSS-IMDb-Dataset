",0.0,-0.743,2021-04-12 00:00:00,3,Just terrible. Avoid. Was a disgrace to previously well done thrillers that involved buses.
" Speed but slow
",0.0,0.9965,2021-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Heist was directed by Scott Mann, written by Stephen Cyrus Sepher and Max Adams, and stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Dave Bautista, Gina Carano, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Morris Chestnut, Robert De Niro, and Kate Bosworth. It's about a man who's escaping a heist he pulled on his crooked casino-owner boss.The Plot: Sepher and Adams play fast with Heist. Not fast enough to hide the clear lifting of elements from 'Speed' and a little 'John Q', but the energy the movie runs off of and the many twists are able to sufficiently distract and keep viewer interest. Silva, AKA ""the Pope"" (De Niro) is attempting to reconcile with his daughter Sydney (Bosworth) and week away from stepping down from his role as casino owner and his employee Luke (Morgan) needs $300k for his daughter's medical bill. Can't have too much originality. After being declined a loan from Pope, Luke joins in on a heist being pulled by fellow employee Jason (Bautista). It goes expectedly wrong and the men have to escape on a bus, which is now being pursued by Pope's man Derrick (Chestnut) and cops Kris (Carano) and Marconi (Gosselaar). As Luke and Jason escape, things get complicated with shifting allegiances, destinations, and tempers.The Characters: A large and regretful letdown is a lack of characterization. While Luke and Kris are likeable enough and the Pope is dislikeable enough, there isn't much given to any of the other key players in the story. Luke is an ex-soldier now making do in life back home, working at the casino for ""too long"" to support his daughter's needs. He's clear-headed and clearly a kind soul who has reservations about further violence; deciding to work with Kris rather than fight her and the cops. Jason is merely a heavy, insisting on doing things the blunt way and dealing with who or whatever may come next. He fights a lot with Luke and that's really it for the second lead. Kris is the trusting officer, sure that there's more to Luke than being a highjacker and is willing to disobey orders to see to a better end. The Pope is a decent antagonist who's everything Luke isn't: apathetic, violent, and greedy. He more or less just spouts orders and some solid lines to everyone around him. Performances are almost unanimously sound, with Carano the odd one out, showing little emotion in an otherwise good thriller/melodrama.The Thrills: Thankfully, Heist mostly makes up for what it lacks in character with energetic scenes of confrontation and threats. It's entirely absurd but the movie truly does not care, which helps it move along at a brisk pace. The titular event is well done in its execution which does a bit of time jumping and has some narration that actually adds personality to the proceedings and it has logic to boot. Hostage survivability is never really called into question though, thanks to Luke's good heart and multiple defusals of Jason which takes away a potential layer of stress but does help to reinforce his attributes. During the times that Heist lurches into action mode it achieves moderate success, more than when it's focused on Luke versus the cops (kinda) versus Jason (kinda). The higher speed chases, a mid-transit medical problem, and the finale are all thoroughly engaging but a little too low in quantity to give the movie more impact.The Technics: For a movie that is all about going (moderately) quick, the camera does a generally good job at capturing the spectacle on hand; the cinematography is nice to look at even when the thrills are reduced to deal with character drama and despite some shaky-cam, Heist is a pleasure to view. Pacing is a coin toss due to the aforementioned reductions in assaults, chases, and tense situations. During said slow periods Heist isn't boring by any means, but few of the more dramatic moments are things that haven't been done better before. Music can be a bit overbearing too but the score is pretty good so it isn't too much of a bother.There's enjoyment to be had with Heist thanks to some genuinely white-knuckled moments and good performances from Morgan, Bautista, Gosselaar, and De Niro but struggles to maintain its pacing which lets the derivativeness show. Still, Heist took my time and I'm in no hurry to steal it back.64/100"
" Embarrassing Movie
",-0.3818,0.1027,2021-02-18 00:00:00,2,"Did Robert Deniro actually read the script before he took this role? That was the most cliched, stereotypical gangster movie I've ever seen. All this movie needed was Pauly Shore and Paris Hilton to become an instant classic. It is amazing that a movie can have that cast and be that stupid."

So he decides to rob his old friend Robert DeNiro's casino. DeNiro is a mobbed-up guy, so he has no choice but to send in his killers. Morgan hijacks a city bus in Mobile to get away, so the SWAT also gets involved.It's a well-made movie once the action gets underway, but the initial set-up grates on me. Why can't Morgan simply explain things to DeNiro? Oh, wait, then there wouldn't be a movie. I suppose that's why I'm not running a movie studio.

" Mostly Good, but the Bad Parts are Ridiculous
",-0.7935,0.7397,2020-11-04 00:00:00,6,"Firstly, I loved the majority of the cast and their actin was up to their usual standards, with one notable exception...Mark Paul Gosselaar. The only thing worse than his acting were the lines they gave him. The director should have spotted this and fixed it, so this is on both of them. Gosselaar's crew were equally bad in their dialogue. I was enjoying the film pretty much other than the one actor, until the ending which really was completely unbelievable and anticlimactic."
" Don't bother
",0.2584,-0.8209,2020-10-24 00:00:00,1,"I don't need to restate what everyone else has said about this movie being terribly written, unintelligent, and essentially a ripoff of every other heist movie in existence.What I will say is that Jeffery Dean Morgan is clearly trying his best. He is the only one, aside from Kate Bosworth who also seems to care at least slightly. Robert De Niro seemed to realize his lines would come across stupid no matter his effort, so he fully phoned it in. Bautista apparently only knows how to portray Drax, only this time he's not funny.The two standouts (in a bad way) in my mind:
Mark-Paul Gosselaar somehow manages to be more unlikable than usual. He's an ""actor"" the same way Heist is a ""movie.""
Gina Carrano is listed on IMDB as an actress, who apparently has had other roles in her career, which I can only assume is some major oversight. Maybe she has dirt on some unfortunate producer somewhere. I haven't seen such a flat, lifeless performance since the latest CSI cadaver.Don't waste your time with this trash fire/blatant cash grab."

They just should have made it better, more thrilling, more intelligent, and more creative.I thought it was okay. Not a must watch, but it had some cool things here. I think the robbers were all cool characters. The job was kind of dumb. Deniro's character didn't really speak to me that much. The bus concept would have been awesome. Claustrophobic movie where you learn about the robbers, the bus passengers, and cops. Like Speed. But it wasn't that engaging.Great try though. Okay try I guess.

",0.431,-0.8908,2020-07-29 00:00:00,1,The writing is so just so bad! It sounds like it was written by a high school student. So much of what is said sounds completely unrealistic and just downright stupid. But its not just the dialogue that sounds that way. The entire movie seems unrealistic and stupid. It's so hard to believe that hollywood would make such a poorly written movie with some good actors. I wasted an evening watching half of this movie and didn't even finish it and didn't have time to start another one. I recommend you don't make the same mistake.
" Dreadful
",-0.4404,-0.7184,2020-07-17 00:00:00,2,"Bad lighting from start, DeNiro phoning it in; collecting a paycheck. Everyone else is a cliche, muddled mess."

By the time you get to the end it gives you a cool twist you didn't quite see comming. Heist movies are among some of my favorite. Though the plot feels familiar on this it doesn't disappoint.
" Actually Pretty Good
",0.7269,0.8765,2020-07-11 00:00:00,6,"Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Dave Bautista and Robert De Niro star in this 2015 action thriller. Morgan (The Walking Dead) plays Vaughn, a father who is trying to save his ill, young daughter. He tries to ask his employer, Silva aka Pope (De Niro) for a loan, but refuses and Vaughn decides to rob his casino with the help of a new employee, Cox (Bautista). Their plan backfires and both men find themselves in a police pursuit after hijacking a bus. Gina Carano (Deadpool), Morris Chestnut (Boyz n the Hood), Kate Bosworth (Superman Returns), Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Saved by the Bell) and D.B. Sweeney (Spawn) also appear. This is actually pretty good, there's some dramatic and intense moments, Morgan is great in it and the film is obviously a mix of ""Speed"" ""Ocean's Eleven"" & ""Heat."" Check this out if you're into
action or crime flicks."
" Enjoyable mostly for DeNiro, Morgan, and Bautista
",0.4404,0.8931,2020-07-09 00:00:00,8,"It was not awful as some other people thought. For a movie meant to entertain without having any pretenses, it was enjoyable. The story mostly held together. If anything it had too many subplots going on and some just cancelled out the others, but the twist at the end was good enough for a satisfying popcorn delivery system."
" Definitely underrated
",0.4019,0.872,2020-07-07 00:00:00,8,"Good movie for Netflix. Great acting with decent story. DeNiro, as always, does a great job. Will remind you of Speed but actually has a better plot"

",-0.024,-0.6498,2020-07-06 00:00:00,3,"I won't go into great detail other than to say that the ending of this movie was more like the writers/directors just trying to put a happy face on the finish because they had no idea what to do. When I saw where this was going, I turned it off. The turn of events throughout the film were so flimsy and transparent, there was just no way that this could ever be anything close to real-life drama, and was an awful stretch at an action movie. Wouldn't recommend. DeNiro picked a dog of a film."
" John Q and Speed.....but not as good as either
",-0.3412,0.4537,2020-07-05 00:00:00,4,"The movie is intense and exciting. Stop. That's it.Direction, editing, writing, plot holes everywhere, dumbest cops ever (again), with forced sentimentality at the end that is completely illogical and not in line with character's backstory. And a twist that was definitely added after the fact because if the twist was true, movie would not have happened.Dave Bautista, Robert DeNiro and Morris Chestnut are all capable actors but for some reason seemed miscast or overacted their parts, it was almost depressing like this was just a quick paycheck.Come for the mindless excitement, nothing else."

",0.0,0.4874,2020-07-05 00:00:00,6,"What worked:
the action sequence and car chase scenes are shot beautifully' adding the needed thrill to the movie.What did not work:
everything else; especially the screenplay. The movie has major plot holes, fees superficial in reality and in this fictional world as well. The movie could have been better if we had necessary depth in both of the leading actors' character. The narrative is loose, questionable and many events happen in the movie that,instead of adding charm to the movie, mars the movie. Veteran actor like DeNiro is under stimulated. The movie as a whole fails miserably from what could have been a decent if not great heist.Final verdict: if you have nothing else to do, you may give it a try."
" When Hollywood lets their kids make a movie.
",0.0,-0.9555,2020-07-02 00:00:00,2,"Seriously, this movie is nearly a parody of the genre. Every single plot device has been done to death, but never so poorly. Not only were the twists predictable, but they were done so badly as to be completely unbelievable - even insulting. There were enough notable actors attached, that I can only believe they let their young relatives have a go at making a movie. Speaking of the actors, Morgan was clearly on an island in terms of effort.Honestly, this movie would be bad for a student film. Maybe everyone involved was serving out a court-ordered community service.Truly awful."
" Ok action movie but it looks like they put it together asap

However it could have been more; it looks like they wanted to put this movie together fast. The robing for example would have been more interesting if there was a bit more intelligent plan as 'enployee with access codes walks in and takes the money '. The plot had quite some holes and the trick in the end I've seen before as well. Even deNero looks a bit flawless in this movie."
" Not the best, but good
",0.3952,0.7382,2020-05-15 00:00:00,7,"It's good to see Jeff Morgan in a good guy role. Playing Thomas Wayne for a few minutes didn't do much for him. I'd like to see more of him.There are quite a few plot holes in this film, such as the robbery being in New Orleans (near Slidell, Louisiana) but the bus having Alabama plates and a Louisiana police lieutenant being in charge of a crime scene in Texas, plus numerous plot holes (weren't the police following that bus?). Even so, it's not a bad movie. It's one of those that I might watch once every two or three years or so and worth having in my library."

However the heist goes wrong, and they end up escaping on a hijacked bus pursued both by the police and DeNiro's thugs. There's several neat plot twists, and a great (and believable) ending.

The movie was shot terribly, the acting was ridiculously bad and the story made no sense at all. Unimaginably pathetic.

Thus the lazy judgement. But it gets worse, the detective that comes in to save the day (younger than the other guy in charge and cocky) was horrible. Who writes this crap when you are not working on the A-Team in 1985? TV. It was terrible then, but in a movie in 2015? This is good news to all budding screenplay writers because in college or film school this writing would get you an F grade...yet here we are watching this crap.Of course we need a female cop that is good looking, tough, sassy...she's the one that needs to be Sandra Bullock, but Sandra wasnt a cop and she was believable. Then the lame contact dialogue when cop meets robber on the freeway to gas the bus...like college buddies shooing the casual sarcasm. By this time I was gone...in fact I am writing this as the rest of this sad use of time proceeds.Oh...Negan is playing Negan with a conscience. Either you get that or you dont."

His daughter is in hospital. Luke demanding advance to Pope for her treatment but refused to get any money. Then he decided to rob the casino with help of a greedy co worker using his own plan. The robbery is taken and they have to escape by a bus. All further drama is occurring here till end. Interesting drama will tighten you at your seat till the end. There are one or two twists at the end and you will be surprised. Acting by Jeffrey Dean Morgan is perfect as a helpless father and clever robber. Robert De Niro impressed us as usual with his plain face expressions. Dave Bautista is good as always he is. Another attraction is Gina Carona as a cop. She brilliantly played her role and very much impressed us. As me it is recommended to watch once. Never getting bore. It is action packed thriller. 8 stars from me.

" Well edited action thriller
",0.3612,0.9953,2019-02-16 00:00:00,9,"I really liked the editing to this picture. 30 minutes in and you'll see what I mean. It shaved precious minutes from the overall time, plunging the viewer quickly into the action. It's a very professional, modern looking action movie. I also noticed at least two visual ironies, a cute touch. Possibly the key to this movie is Robert De Niro's character, a very hard role, but when you think back you realise the whole movie pretty much hinges on his performance. Dave Batista also gives a perfect performance. He's also in Hotel Artemis. His character had a definite presence, which given his role, is a bit of a pun I suppose. The hero had a certain charm, and all the supports are well chosen and definitely spot on. It's the thrill to the action that makes this movie. The guns are fantastic, along with the stunts, there's some shocking murders, a hard working pace, and again that brilliant editing. Inevitably this movie will be compared with Speed. Certainly Heist has a similar tension and excitement, a real freight-train. I have to dock it a point for the sheer audacity of the rather same old basic story, but where one might cringe a little at that, it is definitely, by the end, a cringe with a genuine satisfied smile."

There is nothing special or truly unique about the plot as a man who has a daughter that is sick and he has to go to desperate measures to pay the medical costs.As with magic and slight of hand, this film has a small twist you really don't see coming but in the back of your mind are aware of. The cast is really fitting for the story, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Robert De Niro, Dave Bautista, Morris Chesnutt, Kate Bosworth, Gina Carano and add in Mark-Paul Gosselaar to the mix it fits nicely.This is a suspense/action/drama thrill ride pretty much from the start and has a nicely wrapped ending.

I hadn't actually heard about the movie prior to stumbling upon it by random luck on Netflix.For me, at least, ""Heist"" was a movie that had a nice storyline, and it also had some interesting twists and turns along the way. A point of view that definitely isn't shared by all reviewers of the movie.I must admit that the movie was indeed very well carried by both Robert De Niro and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. But then again, with the likes of their acting skills chances were slim to none that this would be a total waste of time. And I must admit that Dave Bautista actually performed quite well here too, and I usually can't claim to be much of a fan of his.""Heist"" was definitely a good combination of story and action from director Scott Mann.

Since when do police let people from a crime scene just walk, they would have taken there names.
Great timing: the bus with the ""pregnant"" lady just stops when the robbers need to meet it!Finaly the message of the movie is the worst of it:
Be a nice criminal and the law lets you do your evil business!
Makes sense since Robert de Niro is part of the movie and he must like the message."

",0.705,-0.5331,2018-03-02 00:00:00,2,"Pathetic script and a shame these quality of actors were forced to try to make this semi-realistic. Only watched the entire thing because Gina Carano was given an opportunity to act and not fight. Hopefully, she'll get more chances after working with greats like Robert De Niro and Morris Chestnut.Quirky ending and unpredictable but still pathetic because it coulda/shoulda been much better."

Why invest in quality actors and then give them 3 minutes of screen time? Why introduce a main character as the initial criminal mastermind, and then morph him into a knuckle dragging moron? Why allow a script with nonsensical details go forward? Are you THAT lazy? OK...is JD Morgan's character Diniro's son? Is the sick kid his grandchild?This movie was a hot mess."
" Unwatchable Cartoon Action exposes JD Morgan
",-0.128,0.7481,2017-11-13 00:00:00,1,"JD Morgan gets a lot of work. His work is unwatchable, not credible, and it is just strange that he is actually employed as an actor. He only plays himself. He is not an actor, just someone who grins for a camera. Each and every part he appears in he plays the same one dimensional character. Robert diNero of course has such a great reputation, I wanted to watch even with Morgan on board. I could not finish this work of claptrap. I came away believing DiNero is finished. His last several films have all be unwatchable. He looks like an old burned out alcoholic in this film. Stiff. Emaciated. Shrivelled up. The plot? There is a casino. It gets robbed, in part to save a sick little girl yeah, right), the robbers get on a big bus that is followed by a million police. The supporting cast is useless and forgettable when they are not being obnoxious. The plot is impossible, well beyond suspension of disbelief to the point where one wonders how drunk and/or stoned the people who green-lighted this pretentious nonsense? This film is a nail on the coffin of a declining Robert DiNero. JD Morgan proves he is a ghost without talent; it would be great to say something good about a film like this, but I just can't. Don't waste your time. RIP Robert DiNero."
" Bad Camera Equipment
",-0.5423,-0.8353,2017-11-07 00:00:00,5,"I don't know if they used DSLRs or something similar to record, but the quality of the lenses they used is horrible. Blurry images everywhere. People record better quality YouTube videos of product reviews these days, and this is a film. The acting is not very good either, looks pretty fake unfortunately."
" Getaway: The Movie
",0.0,0.9894,2017-05-28 00:00:00,2,"'HEIST' was directed by Scott Mann, stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Robert De Niro and Dave Bautista and is the story of a desperate man(Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and his partner(Dave Bautista) who attempt to rob seasoned Casino owner(Robert De Niro). This seems to go well, but as the getaway escalates into a hostage situation, the police get involved and De Niro's men begin to hunt down Morgan and Bautista. ​ I think that every good heist movie should start with a motive, follow with a setup, climax with an impossible job and end with a cheeky wink to the camera and rough explanation of how it was all done. This movie attempts one of these traits. You may argue that this is a bit too formulaic and not sticking to this is a strength to the movie. I would usually be inclined to agree if it went totally left field and tried to do something that didn't payoff. The main strength(s) of every great heist film is the story or the action. Films like 'Ocean's Eleven' has a phenomenal story whereas 'Fast Five' has some stupid, fun action. You have those like 'Now You See Me' who stray in No Man's Land which just serve as pure entertainment. This movie achieves at none of them feats. The story is weak and all motivations for the characters were just poorly written, Attempts at action were pretty shaky and didn't fit with the rest of the movie and there is very little entertainment to be had with a movie that just takes itself way too seriously and is actually kinda depressing.OK so the story was mediocre, the action poorly done and the tone was just wrong, but that doesn't mean there were NO positives in the movie. To start, De Niro was actually pretty good in the movie. Not at the height of his power and definitely not at a level were I actually think he cared but he was still fine. Mark Paul Gosselaar was also pretty energetic for the first half of the scenes he was in and provided a more 'Heist' film performance which fell more in line with what the tone should have been. Needless to say he wasn't good as the story progressed and he loses all charm he had in the first half but nevertheless, he was still a strength for a duration of this thing. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was not at all good as Vaughn. He tried to play the likable, cool headed thief opposed to Dave Bautista's more aggressive, psychotic thief but it didn't pay off. What's more is that you know nothing about Vaughn other than a plot device they include at the start and use as a reason for us to like him but it doesn't work. I liked him more than Cox(Dave Bautista), sure but that wasn't really an achievement. Gina Carano was also pretty poor as Officer Kris and her character made no sense whatsoever.Another flaw the movie can add to its list was how poor the cinematography was. The 'action' scenes were horrifically shot and most of the other scenes were just slow pans. I've definitely seen worse and it wasn't a main reason the movie failed but it was still a flaw and something that needed to be addressed.Heist movies need to provide a fun and engaging heist as a primary rule. This movie delivers about 2 minutes of that. The entire heist of this film is shown over a space of TWO minutes! Even the explanation at the end was poorly done and felt forced. There was literally no setup and I know you can argue that breaking the formula is good and refreshing but the way this movie does it is just bad. It felt like it wanted to follow but it was also trying to distance itself from it as much as possible.In conclusion, I can't really say this movie is worth your time and there isn't really anything that you might enjoy2/10"
" Very Unintelligent
",-0.5095,0.264,2017-01-30 00:00:00,3,"So I thought this movie was something totally different. I actually thought this was a movie that came out years ago in which De Niro played a burglar alongside Edward Norton. Come to find out that the title of that movie was ""The Score."" Although there was a movie called ""Heist"" from 2001 with Gene Hackman. This was neither of those. This wasn't nearly as intelligent as either of them. In fact this movie was hardly watchable, which is extremely disappointing since De Niro was in it.The plot is fairly simple considering the title: there was a heist. Negan, er um Jeffrey Dean Morgan, plays a struggling card dealer whose daughter is sick. He needs a ton of money to keep her on the list for a critical surgery. I didn't get it wrong, I said he needed money to keep her on a surgery list. I never knew you had pay for that. So the scene is set with that simple backstory. And everything that followed was truly simple. The entire operation, the behavior of the principal actors, and the decision making was appalling. A-PALL-ING.There was a series of some absolutely deplorable decisions that made no sense. I know that misdirection was the driving force behind a lot of the events but like Danny Glover said in Lethal Weapon, ""I'm too old for this ****"". Be more creative, be more intelligent, or just be better."
" 'Regrets in death meant you'd lived life wrong. Don't live life wrong.'
",-0.8591,-0.5366,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"When is crime justifiable? Never, but.That seems to be the philosophical question mulled in this fast beat thriller as written by Stephen Cyrus Sepher and directed by Scott Mann. While the film is primarily one of action, the impact of the starting characters is such that the theme seems more thoughtful than most action films.A father Luke Vaughn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is without the means to pay for his daughter's medical treatment. As a last resort, he partners with a greedy co-worker Cox (Dave Bautista) to rob a casino owned by the agile but terminally ill man called The Pope (Robert DeNiro) and his maniacal right hand man, Dog (Morris Chestnut). When things go awry they're forced to hijack a city bus 657 driven by Bernie (DB Sweeney) and take the passengers hostage. Now, in a high speed chase, Vaughn will not only have to outwit the police, led by Officer Bajos (Gina Carano) who are in hot pursuit, but he will have to contend Dog in order to make it through the day alive. But we quickly learn that things are not what they seem, and Vaughn has more than one card up his sleeve.Clever, well conceived plot with many twists and turns and brought of by a very fine cast, including small parts by Kate Bosworth, Stephen C Sepher (yes, the writer!), Christopher Rob Bowen, Alyssa Julya Smith, Hawn Tran, and Tyler Jon Olson. A solid thriller worth an evening's watch."
