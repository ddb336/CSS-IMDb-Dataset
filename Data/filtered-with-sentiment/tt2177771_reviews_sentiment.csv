" the price of the life of a soldier
",0.0,0.9274,2021-04-08 00:00:00,6,"The story in 'The Monuments Men' directed by George Clooney and released on screens in 2014 is worth telling. In the last year of World War II, a small group of Allied soldiers, most of them experts in the arts, were given the task of discovering the fate of the art treasures plundered by Nazi Germany in the countries under its control and saving as much as possible from destruction by the defeated Germans or from falling into the hands of the Russians as 'war booty'. The not so well-known story is based on real facts. A book has been written about it, documentaries or television series were or may have been made. 'The Monuments Men', the fiction movie - as it came out - fails to make a good service to the story, despite investing a considerable amount of talent, especially in acting. By trying to make a film like and in the style of the war films of the '60s, George Clooney almost completely misses the target due to the lack of a common narrative thread interesting enough to capture attention. In the 2010s, the collection of celebrity stars is no longer enough for public success or emotional impact.Frank Stokes (George Clooney), the art expert who manages to persuade President Roosevelt to form a team of soldiers - less than half a platoon - to save Europe's cultural treasures at war from destruction in the situation of answering, several times in this film, the question 'is it worth sacrificing the life of a soldier to save a painting, a statue, or the tower of a medieval church?' The problem is that the question and the answers are formulated through explicit spoken words rather than through convincing cinematic narration. The formation of the group of experts, most of them well past the age of carrying weapons, the training, the landing after the landing in Normandy, and their adventures in Europe in ruins still in the middle of a destructive war are approached in Hollywood style, with a dose of humor that cannot harm, but also with the schematism specific to film productions in the decades after the war, especially when it comes to negative characters (specifically the German officers). The film flows smoothly and pleasantly, the dialogues are nice and intelligent, but the lack of dramatic tension reduces the impact of the film. 'The Monuments Men' contains too much fiction for a docudrama and is too unassuming to be a memorable war film.The cinematography is good and generously provides us with images of the continent in ruins in the final year of World War II, as well as short snapshots of famous works of art that are reconstructed and filmed with authenticity. The list of actors with famous names is impressive. Of all, only Cate Blanchett has enough material that allows her to create a substantial role. It is of course a pleasure to see Bill Murray, Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin and George Clooney himself at any time, but as a viewer I can only regret that their roles in this film are too schematic to allow me to remember their acting here as I have done so many other times. 'The Monuments Men' is a film with an interesting theme and an important message ('culture matters even in the heat of the fiercest battles'), a pleasant film due mainly to the presence of actors that viewers can not get tired of seeing, but the result is less than the sum of talents and efforts put together."
" Very pedestrian
",0.0,-0.9872,2021-02-07 00:00:00,5,"I think in a way The Monuments Men was always doomed to fail. The story and events it is based on are fascinating, and were clearly very important to the preservation of so much of Europe's cultural heritage. However, I can't help but think these events would be more comfortable as part of a documentary rather than a feature film.There just wasn't any of the jeopardy or tension needed to give this film the fire it so desperately needed. We essentially were just watching the group drive around picking up art from areas which had already been reclaimed by the allies or deserted by the Germans. Any attempt to inject tension felt very artificial and out of place.I also struggled to bond with any of the characters. The attempts to build camaraderie between them with japes and banter just didn't work. None of the relationships were believable and all fell quite flat.The film also felt very messy. At times it seemed to just be a collection of disparate scenes which weren't even remotely connected. There was no real drive in terms of the plot, it simply meandered for its runtime with very little purpose.I also can't forgive this film for the criminal under/mis-use of Cate Blanchett. In fact, none of the superb cast really had a chance to shine. The screenplay was stacked against them, so don't let the dazzling A-listers fool you - the performances are well below par for all of them.A swing and a miss."
" Doesn't capture the spirit of the setting
",-0.1326,-0.303,2021-02-05 00:00:00,3,"I've always said it's difficult to make a war comedy, simply because war isn't funny. The best war comedy I've seen is still a drama, but with such endearingly charming characters you can't help but laugh: Go for Broke! Movies like The Monuments Men that don't even try to capture the spirit of war, but instead rely on a ""good-old-boys"" cast and quips that real soldiers would never say don't stand a chance at capturing my attention.I only sat through it because my parents wanted to see it, and who was I to bust up movie night? My advice is to watch the preview. If you get a chuckle or two out of it and like seeing Matt Damon's smirk and George Clooney's head tilt as they (don't) pretend they're in the 1940s and could, in theory, be killed at any moment, go ahead and rent it. You'll probably like it, and that's great. There's nothing wrong with light entertainment. I just prefer my war movies to be a little more realistic and substantial. A story about a platoon charged with guarding priceless art instead of being sent to the front could have been interesting - with real characters. Can you imagine any of these fellows going through basic training? Or are they just Matt Damon, George Clooney, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, and Bill Murray in soldiers costumes?"

" An Uplifting, Historically Informative Movie
",0.0,-0.2412,2020-09-27 00:00:00,9,"Before viewing this film, I hadn't thought much about the endeavor to rescue art works and other treasures stolen by the Nazis. The Monuments Men gives a peek at what went into that effort. It presents a view of the noble efforts on the part of the Allies in World War II, especially, the Americans, British, and the French Resistance, to preserve history.It is not an action movie, but there is some action interspersed. The tone is mostly upbeat, but it does confront tragedy.Although the setting of the movie is amidst war, the war itself is mostly a backdrop. In this respect, it's comparable to Life is Beautiful (1997), though The Monuments Men is somewhat grittier, and based on real history."
" Good history telling
",0.4404,0.6592,2020-09-15 00:00:00,9,"Can't vouch for total historical accuracy, but very moving story. Glad it was told."
" Good movie but...
",0.4404,0.5766,2020-09-11 00:00:00,8,As I write this in 2020 it was hard not to think of Clooney and Damon and other Hollywood elites who have said??? about our American monuments being torn down during this past year. It clarifies this ... these are just actors with no more worth in thought than any other American. They are JUST actors. And we need to stop treating their loud voices as if they are as honorable as the roles they play.
" Clooney must have been reading some Daniel Silva books
",0.0,0.7938,2020-09-08 00:00:00,3,"Clooney tries to channel the feel of Silva's Gabriel Allon series and fails miserably.He has all the great cameras and lenses and equipment to make a nice looking picture, but none of the artistic instincts to know when to linger or really let a scene flourish.He also doesn't seem to understand the human connection to art other than on some binary ""good v evil"" choice.And what's a George Clooney movie without he and Matt Damon seeming to barely contain their smiles about how clever they make each other feel?"
" Good movie

" Try hard attempt at a true story.
",0.34,0.9555,2020-08-27 00:00:00,5,"If only the monuments men could get past telling us what it was trying to be, it might have had a chance to tell us a good story.
the reality of the premise behind the monuments men is that this would have been an easy tale for anyone to tell, and one that most would have enjoyed. A bunch of senior art experts go after art stolen by the axis forces during WWII. Dare I say it the film could have followed anyone of the individual stories of any of the members of the MFAA and been much better for it, but pulling in a big cast, and following all the 7 members, monuments men finds itself to spread out to find the time to tell a good story, as a viewer I couldn't tell what period in history I was sat in nor what location, so building up my own mental picture wasn't possible. Toward the end the cast do come together (well all the Americans anyway) but at this point I was frustrated and disenfranchised. I would have given the film a lower mark but the cinematography and the sheer scale of locations and sets used, means that, someone at least, worked really hard.
Those looking for historical accuracy might find that in the title ad the general overview, but little more, names are changed locations on maps aren't really real, even the history behind some aspects of the film have been modified for the audience, when in reality they just needed to tell the truth, and it would have been a better film.
Next time someone in Hollywood is looking for a good story, they might like to consult the biography of one Albrecht Gaiswinkler. Who spent most of his pre war years as opposed to the Nazis in Austria. Deserted the Wehrmacht during the war and then was airdropped back into Austria by the allies to protect the art hidden within the altaussee salt mine, for 5 months and with help from 300 locals, he protected the valuable art from being destroyed by the Germans whilst maintaining and active resistance within the town and villages surrounding the area.
His story then proves what could have been
If the film got past what it thought was important and just told a story."
" Could have been so much more
",0.0,0.8922,2020-07-26 00:00:00,5,I did like the Cinematography.. but the story is just dry... a movie the promised with a great cast but just can't deliver.. I would pass on it
" It's a good movie, but it should have been much better.
",0.7003,-0.7008,2020-07-06 00:00:00,7,"What a wonderful movie this could have been; the subject is exceptional - but this script is watered-down, sanitized to a point where it's neither a docu-drama, mystery, a heist or even much of a war movie. I've seen documentaries on the subject that were far more engaging.It's a fairly good movie for a Sunday afternoon, but overall it's forgettable which is an injustice to the source material."
" Uneven but a necessary story
",0.0,0.9168,2020-07-03 00:00:00,6,"The story is uneven, Cate Blanchett is wonderful, the sets and lighting are beautifully done. Drama/comedies are hard to pull off and this film is proof. If Clooney had gone more comedic or more towards the drama it would have done better. The basic story is true, the Nazis also burned pieces symbolically and used art to finance the war. It is a complicated story for certain."
" Slow and Boring
",-0.3182,0.8273,2020-06-04 00:00:00,2,"Was really disappointed with this movie. A great cast and a super idea for a movie, but just fell flat. Whilst the specials effects and scenes were fantastic, nothing happened. It flatlined the whole time."
" Pretty Lame really
",0.1027,-0.1986,2020-05-10 00:00:00,5,"Moderately entertaining if somewhat unbelievable.
It's a bit hard to take seriously someone as grossly obese as John Goodman in fatigues. There's no way anyone could have got to that size on wartime rations let alone manage an assault course.
Clooney has said the film is about ""80% accurate."" Personally I find that a little generous given that the climax of the movie is ripped off a real life event completely unrelated to this story. It is actually a retelling of the US's mission to beat the Soviets to Werner Von Braun and his missile research and nothing to do with saving works of art.
But from the rest of the unengaging storyline I'm guessing there wasn't actually enough excitement in the true events to warrant an interesting screenplay.
In summary, it passes a couple of hours if you are bored. Band of Brothers - it ain't."
" poor performance
",-0.4767,-0.9174,2020-05-09 00:00:00,2,"The story was uninteresting and the plot was never exciting, so it was mostly boring. It was one of the worst war movies I've seen."
" A Small Piece of the Story of Art Looted or Destroyed by the Nazis
",-0.4939,0.9914,2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"Odd that no one ever made this movie 60 years ago. ""The Monuments Men"" assembles a cast in very much the way as post-World War II films like ""Command Decision,"" which brought together Clark Gable, Walter Pidgeon, Van Johnson, Brian Donlevy, Charles Bickford, John Hodiak, and Edward Arnold in a compelling but largely forgotten study of the military vs. politics. Forgotten in much the same way ""The Monuments Men"" is likely to be forgotten in 60 years, even thought it stars George Clooney, Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bill Murrary, Jean DuJardin, Kate Blanchette, Bob Balaban, and Hugh Bonneville.You have to give director and star Clooney credit for bringing to the screen this tale, based on historical events, of a group of art experts drafted into the military to recover paintings and sculpture looted from across Europe by the invading Nazis. Their sacrifice, their harrowing mission, saved countless works of art destined for destruction by Hitler and his team of vandals, who believed that if they couldn't have them nobody else would either.I was reading ""The Clarinet Polka"" by Keith Maillard, a 2002 novel that's been waiting on my bookshelf for a dozen years. In this wickedly funny book about life in a Polish community in West Virginia, I read on page 107: ""To Mrs. Dluwiecki, everything that was good and true and beautiful was Poland before the war. She went on and on about the beautiful china and crystal and silver her family used to have, and all the oil paintings that'd been in the family for generations. She remembered all the fancy outfits she'd ever worn, and she described them to Janice down to the finest detail. She even remembered things like her white veil and her little white shoes from her first Communion that she'd saved in a special wooden box, and the little silver scissors her mother had used to cut the roses-and all that beautiful stuff was gone, lost, plundered by the Germans. She didn't even have any photographs from those days. She said she'd lost her precious heritage and all she had left was memory."" And so it was with millions of Poles-Jews and Gentiles-who lost their heritage, their homes, and six million of them their lives in the Holocaust. I put the book on the coffee table and went to see ""The Monuments Men.""Set in France and Germany, it was disappointing that ""The Monuments Men"" mentioned Poland only once in the entire film when early on George Clooney, as leader of the group, explains that the Nazis have been ""stealing art from Amsterdam, Warsaw, and Paris."" Historically, the Allies never came to Poland's rescue, and the movie shows the Americans narrowly missing the Russian army as it advanced into Germany, having already ""liberated"" (meaning taken over) Poland. Late in the film we see, but only if we are alert enough to notice, that Leonardo da Vinci's ""Lady with an Ermine"" (now hanging in the Czatoryski Museum in Krakow) is one of the paintings these brave men recovered.Historically interesting and beautiful to watch, ""The Monuments"" Men somehow falls short of generating in the audience the kind of passion for art that possessed the lead characters. How much more compelling this film would have been in the hands of Poland's great director Andrzej Wajda."
" Slow Starting, But Catches Up
",0.0,0.8668,2020-04-25 00:00:00,8,"Yah, it is slow starting, but then (about a third of the way in) really takes off! The subject of Monuments Men was interesting and I would dare say most of us never would have learned or known about this otherwise; (or am I the only philistine?)
I think you judge for yourself... I gave it an eight... really enjoyed it."
" Would Recommend: An Interesting History Lesson
",0.6369,0.9972,2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,"The Monuments Men brought together a great story with a great cast, but lacked anything else. I believe the only reason someone would watch it is because of either the cast or the story (that is the reason I watched it). Interesting enough to keep my attention throughout the whole movie, but that is only carried by the story which I feel was a pretty safe story not to mess up. Even this adequate portrayal of what happened during this WWII art mission flick was enough to keep me on my seat. I would recommend it to people, but only because, I believe other people would be interested in what happened and possibly to see a stellar cast make you chuckle a bit.I was very impressed with Cate Blanchett's portrayal of a french art curator. I thought her accent was impeccable and her sass and attitude of her character (Claire Simone) was a joy to watch. I felt the other actors performed like characters they had played before, very predictable but I wouldn't say boring. They as were expected, which, for actors of their stature is not bad.Overall this film felt like an interesting history lesson with an unnecessarily overqualified cast. I felt it missed a few of the marks in some of the more emotional scenes and maybe could have upped the stakes a bit in regards to having a more stand out villain. But the story was amazing and even a few days after I have watched it, I still think about it. So I would recommend it, not because it is a great movie, but because it is a great story."
" A good message, a good and lazy cast, a good story without anything special. A warm film, in short.
",0.5067,0.9979,2020-03-05 00:00:00,5,"This film tells me a lot. I am a historian, I understand the importance of art, the historical and artistic heritage, and I am well aware of the irreparable loss that all wars cause in the cultural heritage of nations. Portugal, my country, has always kept distance from European conflicts, a situation conditioned by geography, but which has allowed my country to pass through raindrops and to be spared in many times of difficulty. Even so, we know what a large-scale war is: we were invaded by Napoleon Bonaparte, with great devastation and loss of life and property, and many pieces of art (mainly sacred art, furniture and jewelery) were stolen and taken to France at that time. So, watching this film and seeing the efforts of a handful of men to save pieces of European culture is something that has meaning for me because it is something that, in such a dramatic war, I would also be able to offer to do. Yes, without a doubt ... it is worth risking to save pieces of art and culture that are truly irreplaceable and allow them to return to their rightful owners.George Clooney is a multifaceted man. Director, screenwriter, one of the main actors ... he certainly embraced this project with commitment, and the cast is full of stars like Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Hugh Bonneville and Bill Murray, great actors who have, in the past, given proof of talent beyond any doubt. The problem is that there are so many good actors that I felt that they never reached the potential they deserved, limiting themselves to a warm and sometimes lazy performance. So much money and good human capital involved and Clooney doesn't know how to take advantage of all this and make an incredible movie with these stars?The script is good and the story told is very interesting. In fact, the film entertains and captures the audience but it is a little boring to feel that, in some parts, it tries to be dramatic and, minutes later, it is desperately trying to make us laugh. The length of the film is also a bit exaggerated, given the story told. At a technical level, the film has good production values: a photograph that is pleasing to the eye, good sound, visual and CGI effects, good costumes and scenery, but something that really surprises us is missing. It is a very average film in everything. And the most tiring is the soundtrack ... composed by Alexandre Desplat, it constantly sounds adventure with touches of comedy and announces a light and fun film, with some sense of grandeur. Actually, the film has funny parts but it lacks that sense of adventure and has nothing grand or epic about it, which makes the soundtrack a little too presumptuous.I liked this film for its message about the importance of heritage, culture and preservation. I liked the story told and felt that the film is worth it but there is nothing fantastic or special about it. It's just another movie set in World War II, good for spending some idle time and nothing more."
" European Christian Civilisation

In Europe today, the European Union has turned its back on its Christian foundations. It is ashamed of Christ. Early on, Clooney's character gives an unabashed, unambiguous and moving argument that says the (Christ-centered) artwork that he is trying to preserve is the pinnacle of Western civilisation.Let the cowardly, lily-livered liberal leaders who are selling out Europe's heritage and are doing the Nazi's work shove that in their pipes and smoke it.

" Take Off The Shroud To Be Enlightened
",0.4939,0.9795,2019-12-27 00:00:00,8,"As a young ""Army-brat"", I was taken to the Acropolis of Athens in Greece, where I mindlessly viewed the site as a playground full of rubble for the tossing. Some years later, as a freshman needing credits in college, I enrolled in a History of Architecture class and with jaw agape I found myself thoroughly exploring what the Acropolis of Athens epitomized to humankind. Thus, I was enlightened.So, on a recent rainy afternoon, The Monuments Men unfolded on my smaller screen. As I read the movie's logline, it had never occurred to me just how much the world of art may well have lost during World War II. Once again, I was enlightened.The Monuments Men garnered my attention from opening credits, but the more story unfolded it was as if I too were uncovering a fantastic work of art. Yes, Monuments Men is not your typical WWII battlefield endeavor, but with an open mind you can still unearth the dramatic irony in aging art aficionados weaving their way through resistive warzone commands, while trying to get their collective assignments accomplished. Assignments that transitioned into affairs of the courageous heart, all the while leaving the audience with heart-wrenching passages of tragedy.Coming full circle, those same people who suffered through my childish antics on the Acropolis, would have been treated to similar escapades if they had also taken me to see a parched genre akin to The Monuments Men. However, I later realized the reasoning behind why my parents forced me to attend those protracted movies and to visit those tedious ancient sites, as such. Now, I thank my lucky stars they instilled that cultural foundation within me to nurture and I do so every day.To that end, give The Monuments Men its due. The storyline has appeared as a misfire to some, but the acting ensemble, the heroics portrayed, and the curatorial triumphs of perpetuation are very entertaining, let's just say, to those of us with a hint of cultural exposure."
" Sophomoric and Didactic
",0.0,0.9479,2019-12-14 00:00:00,5,"Pretty sure that this film was made only because George Clooney commands respect in Hollywood. If the script had been forced to undergo the usual review process, it would have been swiftly rejected for its juvenile dialogue, its transparent and unnecessary preachiness (who thinks the Nazis were good and should not have stolen people´s possessions?), its lame attempts at humor, and its derogatory depiction (dare I say ¨sexist¨?) of the woman apparently responsible for the recovery of thousands of artworks which would otherwise have been lost forever.For aspiring screenwriters and directors, The Monuments Men serves as a cautionary tale: do not presume that because you do one thing well, you are a master at everything else. Screenwriting and film direction are difficult, complex crafts best left to professionals, not actors flying by the seat of their pants. Yes, with work and diligence you can become a professional film maker, but producing an excellent film takes much more than having friends in high places, or even knowing a group of actors willing to star in your vanity project to earn some quick cash."

Confidently directed by Clooney, this gorgeous film follows a group of WWII soldiers with one very complicated task: rescue and recover as many great works of art as they can from the Nazis. Sounds like an easy job, right? Nope. With the Germans losing the war, they started retreating back into their native land--and took everything they had pillaged with them. Or burned it. Clooney, Damon and Blanchett are great -- I got a distinct ""wartime Ocean's 11"" vibe from them -- but the real standouts are Bill Murray and John Goodman, investing their characters with heart. It's not the greatest movie ever made, and not even the best WWII movie ever made (that's Schindler's List, a movie I saw once and never need to see again), but it's the kind of the un-ironic, un-cynical movie Hollywood doesn't make any more."

Turns out, she over-rated this movie by quite a large margin.
I can almost imagine Clooney calling up his buddies and asking, ''Who's up for a paid European vacation? We don't have a shooting script, so we'll just makeup as we go along. I read the book. It'll be fine. Trust me.""
It's earnest and dull on a level rarely seen these days. The way they're always staring at the paintings when they discover them. Check out Clooney when he finally comes across a key piece. Whoa. What's he doing with his hand there?
The narration somehow makes it even worse, driving it to a point of pathos that I haven't seen since the days of the NBC Very Special After School Special.
If you want to see the story of saving art from the Nasties, watch The Train. If you want to see American soldiers goofing around behind the lines while chasing valuables, watch Kelly's Heroes or Three Kings.

Yes I gotta admit the movie did drag a bit for a nearly 2 hour movie, but at least we got to see the full detail of each men in what they went through during that time. You'd think that they had a easy way to search all the stuff that was being stolen by the Nazi but christ, the Nazi's did plant a few boobietraps. I gotta admit viewing the whole film was pretty intense cause you just think all the men were gonna die by being caught by the Nazi's or Russians. Unfortunately 2 men from the monuments clan did die and it is pretty sad. Thankfully the others didn't die but still, it's sad to lose good soldiers!Props to Clooney, Damon, Goodman and the rest of the monuments guys who played a good few of the heroes from World War II.

",0.4404,-0.9899,2019-04-09 00:00:00,6,"The Monuments Men: 6 out of 10: George Clooney directs a breezy tale of the Allied troops that were in charge of making sure the Americans didn't destroy every single piece of art while taking back Europe single-handedly.The Good: You know that Steven Spielberg ruined World War 2 films for an entire generation. Movies like The Monuments Men used to be much more common before Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List. The British in particular were rather fond of them. Thankfully after twenty odd years this too severe by half World War 2 treatment finally seems to be passing, +and we can now get back to various genres feeling at home in World War 2.The Monuments Men is a throwback to the old fashioned war film where a bunch of chaps pulls one over on the Nazies. There is a breezy, light humor to the whole affair with some sad moments sprinkled in.The Monuments Men is also a very nice production with a top-notch cast. There is some seriously high-quality set dressing in this movie. It is one of the better-filmed representations of this time during the war in Europe.
The Bad: I praise the acting, but I have to admit that John Goodman does not look good in this movie. He seems in ill health and out of place (He is acting among Bill Murray and Bob Balaban neither of whom are athletic specimens or spring chickens themselves.) His story is also the weakest of all the characters which bring us to a severe structural problem the film has.For some reason, the eight or so Monument men split up early on, and all have their adventures either by themselves or in This makes it hard to get invested in the story as a whole as we are hopping fairly often between characters. This constant hopping around makes scenes often feel like interesting vignettes rather than part of the entire story. As a result, we often have severe tonal shifts as a sad, sentimental scene swishes over to a high farce or budding romance with barely a segue. A filmmaking technique I call meanwhile in Paris.Another query why does Clooney insist on making his men such freaking boy scouts in this movie? Making Matt Damon's character an adulterer or maybe have one of the guys be racist would have gone a long way to shading these ciphers. As it is the cast lacks any real dimension outside of the most surface tropes.Clooney is invested in the mission as told in his tale and lessons regarding the importance of art for civilization. He also fears that the movie-going audiences knowledge of Italian Renaissance painters is restricted to those that were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So there is a lot of talking down to the audience and explaining the main point of the film over and over again.The Ugly: I have long given up on historical accuracy in movies, but here we go. The actual Monuments Men consisted of 345 men and women from 13 countries, not seven guys. Preparation started before the US even entered the war, and General Eisenhower was a major proponent. Cate Blanchett's character is Rose Valland the famous member of the French resistance who did thwart a lot of Nazi art stealing. If your curious what she did the 1964 John Frankenheimer wartime thriller The Train is based on one of her books.And then there is the Nero Decree that the plot of the last part of the film depends. It is as if Clooney realized that the Nazis plan of taking the art, storing it safely, and then putting it in a museum lacked a particular menace. So we have Nazis burning art and a race to save it. Unfortunately for the movie, the Nero plan was about burning railroad terminals, not Monets and it was never implemented by Albert Speer anyway.In Conclusion: Overall the film was a pleasant experience with beautiful sets and locations and good acting. Just not a lot of substance there and the film never feels confident in its audience to come to their own conclusions."
" Cloone at his pompous worst
",-0.6249,-0.637,2019-02-23 00:00:00,5,"There is a good idea for a movie here but this wasn't it. It's slow, confusing and boring--and did I say slow? The movie suffers terribly from a self-conscious effort to make viewers grasp the IMPORTANCE of what they're watching, made worse by Clooney's interminable and self-important voice-overs. This is a great cast wasted on what is ultimately a boring docu-drama. It just confirms you should never see a movie where the star is also the director and writer, unless it's Eastwood. Clint would have done something great with this story but Clooney just couldn't--or at least didn't."
" A competent but uneven movie
",0.1655,-0.2382,2019-01-28 00:00:00,7,"Directed by George Clooney who also starred and included Matt Damon, John Goodman, and Cate Blanchett, this movie inspired by the World War II allied effort to save invaluable art treasures that the Nazi's had stolen, has trouble with its overall tone. It has very poignant moments especially over the dramatized risk of the soldiers took in saving their valued treasures as well as a sensitive subplot between one male soldier and a French woman. Unlike The Great Escape (1963), this World War II movie doesn't seem to find its balance between comedy and drama in either its direction and musical selection. A competent but uneven movie about an appealing and different perspective of the War."
" Great topic completely clooneyed
",0.6249,-0.5242,2018-12-22 00:00:00,3,"As often happens with good actors they are terrible as directors - this is another example of it. The mission of saving art during the war deserves a tribute and it could have been as powerful as Schindler's List. There is no need to invent anything, just a loving close to documentary retelling of the true story, assuming that your viewers are not dumb, would suffice. However the opportunity was completely wasted and spoiled by this light-hearted and factually wrong collection of feel-good anecdotes which fall apart as a plot. It's a pity that great cast was wasted. It also has a lot of cold war stereotypes written and often even driving the script, which is impossible to imagine in the actual relations between the allies in 1944-1945."
" Totally unmemorable

Allied teams sent into liberated Europe to claim art stolen by the Nazis. Director George Clooney has assembled a great cast including Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Cate Blanchett and Hugh Bonnevile. The movie does not work. There is no drama, no tension or even a scene that will linger in your memory. It is a very mediocre film. Maybe its a lack of interesting characters, or the poor script or the light hearted tone. It failed to click with me, and I love war movies! Luckily for me I watched it on blu ray rather at the cinema. The extras on the DVD confirmed what an interesting topic this is, and that Clooney's film failed to make it."

" SAVING PVT. REMBRANDT
",0.0,-0.8672,2018-10-04 00:00:00,6,"In 1944 George Clooney puts together the clean half dozen of art experts to join the military with the purpose of...not killing Hitler or saving Private Ryan...nope. Other Hollywood stars got those jobs. Their job is two-fold, Find art that the Germans have stolen and to save the art from being destroyed by the allies. They are met by people who don't want to help. those that do, and those that are skeptical. The group divides up as our plot divides into subplots. The film opened up as if they were going to save the great art works of Rome, Florence, and Milan, but then limits itself to France and the Netherlands. In spite of the Indian Jones action music, I couldn't be moved as our crew discovered where art was hidden.Yes, the evil Hitler was taking art out of the hands of private collectors and was going to place it in a public museum. In order to create an adrenalin rush our group finds a decree signed by Hitler to destroy all art should Germany fall and BTW the Russians were carefully taking the art as spoils of war.The film had some mild moments of humor, drama, and some heartfelt scenes, most made possible by the soundtrack. The worst case scenario would be the art would all be destroyed and we would now have more engineers and less scholars on European Art History.An interesting film that was done well, but it wasn't really a war film, action film, or a gripping drama.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Cate Blanchett asking Matt Damon to bring his potted meat."
" Interesting and original idea, poorly developed and executed
",0.6124,0.8875,2018-09-28 00:00:00,4,"1944. With the tide of WW2 turning against Germany, the Allies set up a team to find and retrieve hordes of priceless art, stolen by the Germans during their occupation of Europe. Due to the fear that the Germans will destroy the artworks, the team need to be as close to the frontlines as possible, putting them in great danger.An interesting and novel concept, as the search and recovery of the artwork the Nazis stole actually happened, and was a tremendous feat, yet the story is hardly known nor told. So the movie had the potential to show the search in a gritty and edifying manner. Unfortunately, in going from concept to script, The Monuments Men goes from good to mediocre and just gets worse when filmed. Written by George Clooney and Grant Hersov and directed by Clooney, the finished product is sloppily written and amateurishly directed. Cheesy, sanctimonious and not historically or militarily correct, the movie starts badly and never recovers. Instead of being an edifying drama, Clooney tries to throw in humour, lowering the tone, and then the humour is very weak and unoriginal. Even the comedy skills of Bill Murray and John Goodman aren't a match for a poor script.It feels like an Oceans movie: assemble heaps of friends and other big-name stars, give them back-slapping dialogue and make it feel like one huge in-joke."
" The Monuments Men - Receive a Rather Smal Monument
",0.0,0.9906,2018-05-03 00:00:00,4,"I'm sure Mr Clooney had some good intentions for making this work but did he really have to set his hand to writing and directing? These tasks he has done rather poorly and drags much of his good intentions down to the level of a typical Dirty Dozen meets Oceans 11 type - this story needed more respect. It's also getting to be overly obvious that George 'casts' his cigarettes as closely as his co stars - everything he does features smoking as a major influence to the story (looks ominously like payola unfortunately?) His big cast are also pretty much your Hollywood HBO TV variety and their characters are underdeveloped to the point of creating little empathy. Pity, as the initial-based-on-fact story is worth a far stronger treatment. A good documentary could have covered this more convincingly. I'd recommend taking another look at Frankenheimer's ""The Train"" to get a better understanding of the significance of this whole Nazi 'Art theft' business. George was fortunate to get his big budget back but, I suspect many might have been somewhat disappointed with the end product considering such a costly input."

In case you are wondering this is set in wartime Europe, yet every town and city is lit up like Disneyland on steroids - apparently never heard of the blackout. Even military camps near the front line are complete with floodlighting and every soldier wandering around carrying a torch, that's not to mention the shower tent with lashings of hot water at the Battle of the Bulge!
Paris in wartime apparently had loads of women dressed to the nines gazing at the latest fashions on display in the shops, even Cate Blanchettes flat was stuffed with every mod con and of course lashings of food and wine.
War torn Europe after almost five years of war was a place of misery and deprivation, with destruction that obviously could not be imagined by the producers of this film.
It completely ruined the whole structure of the film, the team appeared to be looking for stolen good in downtown New York!"
" The Monuments Men should've been interesting...it wasn't.
",0.0,0.9922,2018-02-28 00:00:00,5,"Films set in World War Two are incredibly popular and the genre has become saturated. There is no room for mediocrity anymore. In comes George Clooney and his famous Hollywood friends to add to the exclusive list of excellent war movies...Ha! Based on the true story of a group of historians going into Europe to recover artistic masterpieces that the Nazi's stole. The film does not do those historians justice, at all. Quite simply this was a mess, narratively speaking. I was hopeful at the start as Clooney and Damon hire the assistance of other historians. Then the movie kicks into second gear and the group are disbanded to various cities across Europe. The narrative consistently shifts between five (...yes five!) different parties of the same unit. This constant switching was ridiculously jarring and I couldn't maintain focus on what the heck was going on. It wasn't a cohesive narrative, it was like watching five separate stories in one film. Not to mention that nothing here was engaging or compelling. Character development was minimal, editing was rushed...this could've, and should've, been executed better. Even the acting felt bland, hardly any acting at all! Only Blanchett and Dujardin felt immersed in the story. Everyone else was just themselves but in costume. Clooney clearly focussed on his directorial efforts and it showed. I honestly think his directing style is great. It's clean, sharp and he isn't afraid to let the actors do their job. I appreciate the light hearted atmosphere, rare these days in a war film but it felt like Dad's Army instead of Saving Private Ryan. There were glimpses of humour, particularly with the land mine scene where our characters actually interacted. But ultimately it was too little too late to save this. Mediocre at best."
" A splended historical effort
",0.0,0.9109,2018-02-09 00:00:00,9,"Unlike many of the mainstream critics, I found this movie to be totally entertaining and informative -- a pleasure to view in a big screen theater. The editing and video segues are slick and easy to follow. And the interaction among the cast members makes this a totally enjoyable experience. George Clooney is said to have been despondent about the lack of this film's box office success, even though it turned out fine globally. I can say without equivocation that some films just need to be made, no matter what box office receipts turn out to be. This was one of them.
As the rise of despotism worldwide churns our stomachs, it is imperative that we're never allowed to forget what's at the end of that road. This movie displays it without varnish to try to keep the public focus on vigilance. Clooney, Matt Damon, John Goodman and Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett headline a cast that delivers at every turn. Rent this movie if you haven't seen it and then take the phone off the hook while you watch. It will be time well spent."
" Should be way better
",0.4404,0.9244,2018-02-03 00:00:00,6,"This film should be far more engaging than it is. It is about six men selected to retrieve art works stolen by the Nazis, and Bill Murray is in it. That should be enough to make it a near classic. However it never really reaches the comedic or dramatic potential promised in the trailer which is in fact a better experience than the film itself. Part of the reason for this is the lack of momentum caused by the story being spread between the different stories of the cast. Things seem to meander along without a great sense of urgency and as a result the audience may be compelled to feel slightly disinterested. If any art is going to be saved can everyone involved hurry up. Considering the cast and the plot this film could have been allot more fun. The editing itself does not grip the attention. Just one good map reading scene and a couple of arguments between the characters about what they were up against would've made some difference. Instead it sort of ambles and bundles its way towards the end with Matt Damon's contribution more like an extended cameo. Ultimately this film could have been allot better."
" Boring and stupid

" Art for Art's Sake

Naturally, with the overall victory over Germany and Italy still in doubt there aren't many resources available to them and the task at hand is extremely dangerous as well. However, their efforts are rewarded to a certain degree when a man named ""Frank Stokes"" (George Clooney) is given the authority to assemble a squad to carry out the mission. To that effect, he gathers various art collectors and enthusiasts that he can trust and together they venture into France, Belgium and even Germany in order to acquire the treasures before the Germans can hide or destroy them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film in large part because it was based on a true story. Having said that, however, I must admit that there were some scenes that seemed a bit contrived and unrealistic. Be that as it may, that's not to say that I necessarily disliked this film and all things considered I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."
" A Mostly Engaging Watch!

Edsel and Bret Witter, 'The Monuments Men' is a well-crafted & mostly engaging film by George Clooney, that wins over its flaws. While the Writing's tone shifts abruptly at times, the fine cast & deft direction by Clooney keep the goings-on thoroughly watchable.'The Monuments Men' Synopsis: An unlikely World War II platoon is tasked to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves and return them to their owners.'The Monuments Men' is based on a true-story about war heroes who went near the war-zone to save creative masterpieces. You'd ask who goes out there in the middle of a bloodbath for sake of art? These heroes did! Why? Because Art defines humanity & how Art stands tall for its time & beyond. 2 of its heroes even lost their lives while on their mission & guess what, their sacrifice wasn't only to save art, but also humanity that lies beneath the masterpieces we talk about to date. Be it Michelangelo's Madonna or an Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece to name a few, remain as Artful & are considered as Creatives Masterpieces. And these heroes made sure they remained among us, despite the violence & menace all around them. Now that's Heroism!And it helps that the cinematic motion-picture about these heroes is bought to life by Oscar-Winning Film Giant - George Clooney. Keeping the pace moving & his direction consistently deft, Clooney delivers a film that offers some inspired laughs & a number of fascinating moments, that win you over. Of course, Clooney & Grant Heslov's Writing isn't always tight & the tone shifts from light to dull at times, but overall, this is a fascinating story that you might have not even heard of, but should experience, to respect its heroes. Clooney knows his job & while he can Write better, he sure knows how to direct & create an atmosphere for its subject matter. Phedon Papamichael's Cinematography, Stephen Mirrione's Editing, Alexandre Desplat's Score & the Excellent Production Design, merit a special mention. Performance-Wise: Clooney delivers, yet again! He delivers an entirely committed performance, that never hits a wrong mark. Matt Damon is terrific, as always. Its nice to see this versatile actor indulge himself in a strong supporting role. Cate Blanchett is extra-ordinary. Her sequences with Damon, stand out. John Goodman & Bill Murray deserved meatier roles & lines, but add to the narrative by just appearing here. Bob Balaban is top-notch. Hugh Bonneville & Jean Dujardin leave a mark. On the whole, 'The Monuments Men' is definitely watchable."

The mistake the film (and clooney) makes, is to try and make a jolly jape, comedy out of what should have been quite a serious subject. Which you could have had some laughs with. Yet another film where the true story would have been so much more interesting and compelling than stereotypes, infantile humour and glibnessI suspect in the film makers egos, they were making a classic war film like 'A Bridge to Far' or 'The Dirty Dozen' instead we get the 'Soppy Seven' good actors in search of a script.

Though there are a few incidence of dry humor, some really good, they are very little and very few.

I'm writing this review while the film is still rolling... well it took me 4 days (everyday watching a bit of it) to get to the last half an hour of this film and I cannot bear watching one more second. If I was watching it in a movie theater I'd surely walk away.In the true story, a force of around 300 men chased a huge number of European art treasures to save them from the Nazis and rescue the heritage of the Western civilization. I guess that the number of men was enormously reduced in this film so that the viewer could relate and connect to the characters.. well probably I couldn't care less even if a bomb demolished them all. Some of the real events were altered to serve the dramatic portrayal and every time the film tried to look serious the scenes only seemed hilarious.The WAR COMEDY film was not funny and the war action scenes were so badly executed that they seemed like rehearsals.. For a moment there I thought that the main characters did not care about what they were doing.. as if some of them were forced to do it.. and this goes even for Cate Blanchett! I don't know how the movie managed to make her look so bad.I did not really expect something so serious, but at least a light movie that makes you laugh.. something like ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"". Yet, this movie failed at every level. I only gave it 3/10 because it is based on a true story that was historically quite important. Or else I consider it only slightly better than ""Battle of Los Angeles (2011)""."
