" Neither great nor horrible.
",-0.6871,0.9368,2021-04-05 00:00:00,6,"This is a rather enjoyable mixture of Jane Austen and zombies. It doesn't have the wit of Austen's novel, but the influence is there, and a bit of romance does make its way through to the picture. It's well acted (Matt Smith is delightful) and is all-in-all not a bad way to spend an hour and 45 minutes. I wouldn't pay to see it, though."
" A real missed opportunity with this film
",0.1531,0.9968,2021-04-01 00:00:00,6,"The idea of this film really appealed to me. I love period films and I love zombie films, what's not to love? This seemingly ideal blending of genres could have fantastic but unfortunately it failed to deliver on several counts.There are plenty of positives with this film. Firstly the underlying concept is great and so enjoyable. Following some brief narrative exposition by Charles Dance we are right into the story. I liked the route that they went down in terms of the zombie set up. The plot was actually pretty decent too. I do feel like they could have done more from a story perspective considering the world that they created but it did the job and kept me entertained.Then there's the cast. Lily James is always great and knows how to sell a period role. Sally Phillips was great in a supporting role as was a scene stealing Lena Headey, but the real star of the show for me was Matt Smith. He was so funny in this film and it was at its best when he was on screen. His comedic timing and delivery was impeccable.The real let down of this film was the zombie action. They could have done so much more with this! They set up the Bennet sisters as a bunch of well trained and fierce women, but then really failed to utilise any of this. We were treated to a few set pieces, but they were few and far between and when they did come they were a little flat. I also felt like the film was building towards a big crescendo which never really arrived, making the final act a big let down.I also could not get on board with Sam Riley's portrayal of Mr Darcy. It just didn't work for me and considering his heavy involvement in proceedings this was far from ideal.Overall this film is decent and probably worth a watch if you like kooky/zombie films. I just think there was so much missed potential and this could have become a cult classic with a little more care put into it."
" Unfortunately not the best
",-0.6973,-0.4404,2021-03-12 00:00:00,4,This could've been a decent watch except that Darcy was miscast. This ruins it for every time.
" It was surprisingly funny
",0.6249,0.9906,2021-03-09 00:00:00,8,"Didn't expect to enjoy it but I actually did. The acting is really good, plot was interesting, and even though it was cheesy, I would definitely watch again. It's a good movie to watch if you want to watch something weird and surreal.The plot worked much better than I expected it to, and as a Pride and Prejudice fan, I was pleasantly surprised at the way they blended the original story with zombies. I normally hate parody movies (seriously, never like them) so I am happy to say this is the first parody movie I legitimately enjoyed.If you want to watch a silly movie about romance and zombies that isn't warm bodies, then watch this. It has comedy, action, and a classic love story. Don't take it seriously, and enjoy!"
" Funny change...
",0.4404,0.9929,2021-02-28 00:00:00,5,"""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is a Fantasy - Comedy movie in which we watch five sisters in 19th century England trying to defend themselves from a zombie attack while they have to deal with the pressure of that time of getting married.Since I had already watched the original movie ""Pride and Prejudice"" I knew the main plot but zombies were something new. The change of the plot was very funny and created a different aspect of the movie. The direction which was made by Burr Steers, it was good and he did an excellent job on it. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to mention Lily James' who played as Elizabeth Bennet and Sam Riley's who played as Mr. Darcy, and they were both very good. Lastly, I have to say that ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is a nice comedy movie that will make you laugh and have a great time, therefore I recommend it."
" Paradoxically, a very nice mix of genres between the original plot and a thriller/action/zombie parody with some humor too.
",0.7574,0.9052,2021-02-28 00:00:00,6,"Parody of the film and the book Pride and Prejudice. Excellent work has been done in the costume and representation of the time, as in the plot that remained quite close to the original one. Of course as a parody, it also had doses of humor, but also action as they are all in a fiction world where there are zombies and people have demarcated areas where they remain safe from them. In addition to zombies, elements of the Bible are also involved where a leading zombie will stand out and organize attacks on humans in the End of Days... A strangely good mix of different species that I oddly liked. Clearly watch it as a parody and not as a film based on Pride and Prejudice. Recommended for this kind of parody/thriller/action.6.5/10 from me."
" Been avoiding this for the longest time
",-0.34,0.9198,2021-02-23 00:00:00,6,"But I was pleasantly surprised how fun this was to watch! This coming from an Austen purist and a person who doesn't enjoy action movies. I quite enjoyed the interpretation, granted that naturally the main morals of the story are diffused to the maximum, theres no use even pointing out the inaccuracies of the time period (however it bothered me how they kept some social etiquettes and ignored the other formalities which doesn't make sense). I also immensely disliked Mrs.Bennet's actress, however the creative direction the plot takes was really good."
" Quite fun
",0.5563,-0.1027,2021-01-10 00:00:00,9,"I hate zombie movies in generale,but this one was quit fun"
" Fun and Refreshing
",0.5106,0.9553,2020-12-20 00:00:00,9,"This version was so entertaining and unique. Lots of chemistry and good acting but the story felt overly edited, rushed and alittle muddled in parts. Definitely can forgive those bad aspects though seeing it was a different adaptation that worked well and managed to keep the period look, romance and comedy from the novel."
" Frightfully boring not frightening I am afraid!
",-0.3948,-0.531,2020-11-23 00:00:00,5,"This is not really a zombie movie so if you are expecting TWD effects and style Zombo fans look elsewhere this is not a zombie action movie in the traditional sense of the word!This is more of a period drama faithfully retold with a twist and as such will appeal to all the bookworms and genteel fans of the stories of Jane Austin and Emily Bronte - ie the things your parents or grandparents probably watch on a Sunday night on the BBC around 7pm with their Horlicks, tea biscuits and slippers in front of the fire but to be honest period dramas bore me to tears and this was no exception; not that I am not a fan of literature but I just find it hard going and this comes across as a bit of a vanity project and trying to be smart when it isn't really!"
" Haters are gonna hate.
",-0.7845,0.9871,2020-10-24 00:00:00,10,"I had no expectations for this movie when I first watched it, but it's one of my favorites. It's well acted, funny, has action and romance. It's delightful and I have to imagine the haters do so because they want a true pride and prejudice story. Well haters, they already have those. Haha. If you want zombie entertainment for the sake of entertainment, this is for you. Personally, I keep hoping for a sequel."
" This Was G.D. Delightful!
",0.6239,0.9787,2020-10-18 00:00:00,9,"This was a gd treat. I HAAAATE zombie movies, but love P&P, and I Could Not Stop watching this film. The way they interspersed the zombie World with the P&P world was so fun to watch. This movie was delicious. Definitely will be re-watching."
" Enjoyable
",0.4404,0.9402,2020-10-11 00:00:00,10,I was expecting a lame movie I was wrong it was very enjoyable good storyline good action scenes and to put it over the top the sisters are extremely attractive and they dress very sexy low cut dresses thigh highs and gorgeous smiles. I reccomend watching it.
" A fun, fantastical rendition of P&P- when taken as is, is highly enjoyable.
",0.8588,0.9821,2020-10-09 00:00:00,8,"While I generally like Austen stories, I struggle to read her (tedious) writing style, which gets me into all sorts of arguments with my Austen loving friends.Having said that, I like the BBC P&P and the film with Keira knightly.But this is my favourite. LOLIf you're not into fantasy or supernatural stylings, this is definitely not for you.It is creative how the author and film writers, overlaid a zombie apocalypse on 18-19C England. The original issues of class remain (the wealthy train in Japan, the less wealthy in China etc).There were some changes to narrative sequence, at least in the film version, Eg Lizzie doesn't visit long at Pemberley etc. And the plot regarding Lydia altered.The actors seemed to have fun with their roles and the new world, and the spirited nature of Lizzie remained. James and Riley were great as Bennett and Darcy.Frankly, her rejection of Darcy's first proposal in this is the best rejection ever. I won't spoil it. Suffice to say, if you feel you and you're family have been slighted, all manners of polite regency society are aside. LOLDo not take this film seriously as an adaptation of Austen. Take it for what it is: a fun, reimagining of a much loved story."
" Dreadful
",-0.4404,-0.3597,2020-09-20 00:00:00,2,I've never seen so much carnage in my life. The acting was too forced and not up to standards that i expected. The twist they added to Jane Austin's charming book Pride and Prejudice was taken too far and they ruined the true morality and delight behind the real story. So disappointed. Also Darcy's voice annoyed me.
" How have I not watched this until now?!

" Terrible ! Terrible ! Terrible!
",-0.88,-0.8871,2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,I watched it for sam. I actually thought it would be a great movie. But no! It was horrible. Terrible
" interesting and bad interpretation of a great work (3.5)
",0.5106,0.7965,2020-05-21 00:00:00,3,"Never disliked it could be the worst movie I ever watched.
They have handled a great work in a different style, and it was awful, so it would be better if the zombies invaded it in the old English period. I do not understand why they have unnecessarily included pride and prejudice.
I still have not understood what it has to do. I am frankly against the changing of such magnificent works that this movie already sucks as seen.It's not a movie, it was like a video clip, it's not catchy, I feel like I haven't watched a movie at all. As a result, I do not recommend it badly."
" 5.8? Are you joking?
",0.3094,-0.7469,2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,"10 out of 10, out of 10 out of 10!
I was so sceptical about watching this movie because of the reviews.
Some sad it was poorly thought-out, executed and acted.
What an absolute joke of a waste of their time reviewing this film?
Everything was on point...
... The locations, the premise, the script, the actors, everything was A-ok for a period zombie horror.
The acting was immense as well, with Matt Smith having a believable accent for a change, and the chemistry between Lily James and Sam Riley was electric.
Everything, everyone, and every snsl played their part in an horrifically beautiful story.
I bloody loved it, and you will too!"
" ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains be in want of more brains"".
",0.3818,0.75,2020-05-09 00:00:00,6,"As long ago as 1971 'Monty Python' parodied the musical comedy 'Salad Days' as directed by Sam Peckinpah, while five years later Kitten Natividad recited poetry by H.D. starkers in Russ Meyer's 'Up!' (1976).'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' manages the impressive feat of sustaining such comic incongruity with a straight face for the length of a feature-length movie, aided by necessarily plush production values."
" Why oh why
",0.0,0.893,2020-05-09 00:00:00,1,"Sorry to say but this didn't worth the money to entertain. Cheesy but not the funny loveable way cheesy. Funny but not 'Haha' funny more like the nervous ' why I am watching this' kind of funny. You loved Britney when you were a child and it's okay to be tacky now but no, not a movie from 2016. We have so much more to tell, so many good stories. I wish these just didn't get financed."
" a disappointment
",-0.5106,0.7575,2020-04-08 00:00:00,2,The makers are too interested to make it resemble like Pride and Prejudice. They could just make a zombie movie in the Victorian era instead of spoiling the original Pride and Prejudice. Sam Riley is not that good of a Mr Darcy. I am sure you can have better British actors for the role.
" Fun crossover parody
",0.5106,0.8637,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie. When you read the title ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"" you think ""how silly."" I was expecting this to be ""meh"" at best and downright awful at worst. I was wrong. Having been forced to read the ""Pride and Prejudice"" book in high school, I'm glad they finally made a version where I could understand what was going on and didn't bore me to death. It's the same classic story, but with zombie attacks thrown in. And as bizarre as that sounds and as different as these genres are, they synergize really well. The zombie elements affect the original plot and vice versa. I do have one complaint and that is Matt Smith's performance. As much as I love Matt Smith on ""Doctor Who"", that's just the problem. Whenever he's on screen I feel like I'm watching ""Doctor Who."" He is the comedic relief and he is really good at it but it feels like watching an exact copy of the 11th Doctor, right down to the personality. The zombie elements work really well. The action is over-the-top, without being too over-the-top, and while some parts of the movie look fake at times (blood), it actually works in the movie's favor because it emphasizes that it's supposed to be silly. It's just a parody of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and is in no way supposed to be taken seriously.
Grade: A- 9/10. 4/5 stars"
" Clever idea, but...
",0.4588,0.9692,2020-02-27 00:00:00,4,"As a male who really enjoys Austen's fine novel, I thought this was a pretty clever idea for a whim. But a clever idea needs some thoughtful execution. This film tries, but it sinks fairly quickly. There are a few humorous moments, but it starts to really drag. At times, it was almost like watching a TV level version of Pride and Prejudice...the zombies only occasionally making an appearance. Keep your expectations low and you may find it amusing."
" Pleasantly surprised
",0.6124,0.7524,2020-02-16 00:00:00,7,"If you are looking for a fun movie with horror and romance thrown in, you cannot go wrong here. The story and dialogue is good. The actors are fun to watch. Would highly recommend, but not if you are looking for a serious dramatic adaptation of the classic tale."
" It was very entertaining.
",0.4927,0.7351,2020-02-02 00:00:00,9,"I kept waiting for Matt Smith to open his pocket watch and realize he's the Doctor hiding in an alternate reality ( jk ). I too am an Austen admirer that enjoyed this work and took it at the entertainment value alone. I do think they could have swapped action scenes for building character depth, but at this point I think people watching should be familiar with the real P&P. Just enjoy the good acting. Also I was rereading the book and much of the screen play was indeed vebatum p&p, so I don't get one of the fools that said the script was bad."
" Surprisingly Good
",0.6249,0.9217,2020-01-20 00:00:00,10,"I watched this out of sheer curiosity (and a love for zombie flicks) after skipping over it countless times, expecting to turn it off after a few minutes. I was pleasantly impressed with the budget, acting and plot. I watched the entire movie and have since rewatched it. I recommend this movie to zombie movie fans that want quality without cliche."
" Kickass!
",0.0,0.8899,2019-12-25 00:00:00,8,"Pride and prejudice and zombies is exactly as advertised. The classic romance with a dash of zombie killing action. Lily James absolutely slays as Elizabeth Bennett, combining refinement with good old fashioned action. Sam Riley plays the perfect Mr Darcy. It really is an awesome movie!"
" Jane Austen with swashbuckling action and humor
",0.2732,0.7033,2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,"Love Jane Austen novels and movies, and hate zombie movies, so I never thought I would watch this one. Three years on, one of my sons at college said he liked it, so I gave it a chance. Loved it. Yeah, a bit campy, but the acting, costumes, dialogue, direction, editing, make-up, script, sets were all spot on."
" just badly made
",-0.4767,0.9144,2019-12-04 00:00:00,5,"I thought I saw the film on Netflix.
I am mainly a fan of zombies, but this film was really not good, it was not how the film takes place, but how the film started and the rest. I can see the action so well and not well done
but yes, I watched the film with 3 pauses (😂) that it was sometimes boringthey could have made the film much better"
" Fell in love with this movie...but the plot holes..n.
",0.6369,-0.7264,2019-09-05 00:00:00,9,"Loved the intense chemistry between Lily James and Sam Riley. He really is my favorite Darcy! As others have stated, Matt Smith's portrayal was impeccable and perfect quirky! You can kind of tell that Lily James and he were together while filming as they didn't hide anything during their proposal scene.
My favorite scene of all though is the river/letter/tears scene. That is the scene that should have granted Lily James an Oscar nomination.
Okay. Plot holes...I know there are quite a few. The two that stick out for me are when Bennett is outside and Mrs. Featherstone approaches. She starts to tell her something then Darcy blows her head off! I keep thinking maybe it's about Wickham. I don't see him, but would it have been cool to see Wickham at one of the tables in that first scene?
Also, the blood. There is NO WAY you can fight and kill zombies without your weapons and clothes getting a little on them. At least it was realistic when Darcy and Jane stabbed their zombies."
" Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
",-0.2263,0.9693,2019-09-01 00:00:00,7,"If you like blood/splatter movies, you are going to love it. Watch it in a cinema with well arranged sound system, big screen and you are absolutely going to enjoy it. It's not a horror movie - more of a comedy. The well known pride-and-prejudice story with a zombie's twist. Blood everywhere :P"
" Lavishly filmed and admirably acted.
",0.5423,0.9176,2019-08-25 00:00:00,7,I was greatly surprised by the impressive scope of this film. It really is a very good rendering of Jane Austen's novel-with zombies! Wonderful cast and marvelously acted. It will always remain one of the most memorable versions I've seen.

What this does offer is a surprisingly good retelling of Jane Austen's original book - save for the zombies, of course - and a beautiful, perfect cast. I was interested to see Sam Riley as Mr. Darcy, especially, and was delighted to see how wonderfully he played the part. So, to anyone looking for a fun night at home, this is your movie."

" Watch another adaptation
",0.0,0.3451,2019-05-25 00:00:00,4,"Although surprisingly true to Austen's book, the script does not take enough advantage of the potential in it's original take on the story - comically or otherwise. Hence, it remains mostly one more adaptation, and not the best one at that. However, Matt Smith's performance is one that calls for attention and praise as it is by far the best in the movie."
" Not Too Bad^><
",0.0,0.3993,2019-04-23 00:00:00,6,"To be honest I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I got more than I thought. If your looking for a comedy, this probably won't meet par. The attempt at comedic implementation was unsuccessful according to myself. It all came off very cheesy.All negativity aside, this wasn't a bad movie. It possess an alternate reality in Europe during the colonial ages where people coexist with zombies. I'd almost consider it like a Van Helsingish related scenario with a touch of Kill Bill, except with three chicks and a army colonel.It can get corney but all in all it wasn't a bad flick. 6\10"

But the way they combined these 2 things together was quite clever and enjoyable. Great acting. Most of the script was borrowed from the last P&P film with necessary changes made for incidences of dealing with the undead. I would watch it again! :-)
" Underated fun for fans of zombies, kickass female action leads and comedy.
",0.7003,0.9718,2019-03-05 00:00:00,8,"Its taken me a long time to finally see this movie. Everytime I read a review it got panned. 2/5 stars or 3/10 or 41% etc etc. Let me put all the pretentious self-important critics right.
This film is fun! It's nicely paced, Matt Smith is really funny in The Office comedy style. The Bennet sisters are gorgeous and powerful in the same way as Kate Beckinsale in underworld or Scarlet Johansson as Blackwidow. The premise is gloriously silly like something out of Big Train.
I knocked a couple of points off because the male stars dont hold their own, save for the ever reliable Charles Dance. But critics need to realise this movie is not a period drama. It is not the next 28 days later. Its a silly funny mash up that does what it wanted to do. Bring on great expectations with vampires!"
" One of the better zombie dramas

The Bennett sisters have learned martial arts in the far east because surrounding them are zombies.Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) is fascinated by the humourless and disapproving Mr Darcy (Sam Reilly.) He is a dedicated zombie killer who uses flies to detect the undead.Mr Wickham is one of the charmers of the Bennett sisters who has sinister intentions. He believes a breed of pig eating zombies and humans should be living side by side.The action scenes are a bit of a disappointment. The tone is uncertain, it should had been bizarre and funny. Matt Smith gets it right as Reverend Collins, others are just too deadpan."

" Great casting!!
",0.6892,0.8531,2019-02-11 00:00:00,8,This was really a great and funny parody of Pride and Prejudice! I really appreciate the fact all actors resembled the actors in the Pride & Prejudice movie directed by Joe Wright (which I would rate with a big fat 10!).
" A laughable bad film
",-0.5106,0.9548,2019-01-28 00:00:00,5,"First of all, the acting in this film could have been better by some of the actors. Lily James, who plays Elizabeth Bennet, probably was the only one out of the entire cast that was actually good. She wasn't just a robot, in all of her scenes at least, but showed emotion. The rest of the cast I wish I could say the same but I can't. They all barely show any emotion in any scenes. Now I have nothing against Sam Riley, who plays Mr. Darcy, but I think he was a terrible choice for Mr. Darcy. I have recently watched the 2005 film Pride and Prejudice so I do understand that Mr. Darcy is supposed to come across as emotionless and miserable to the public but when he's with Elizabeth he lightens up a bit. In this film, he's just straight up emotionless and miserable throughout the entire film. At first, I thought they used makeup for the zombies but upon further inspection they actually used CGI and it wasn't good. The reason why zombies are terrifying in this modern day and age is that movies and TV use makeup effects for their zombies. One thing I did like though was the costumes. Just by looking at the characters outfits you can easily figure out their personality. For example, with Darcy, his outfits throughout the entire film are black showing how he is miserable compared to his friend Bingley, played by Douglas Booth, who has more brighter colours showing how he is more outgoing. Finally, the musical score, composed by Fernando Velazquez, is fantastic and you can easily listen to it an understand what's going on at that point and time in the film. In the end, this film isn't great but if you turn your brain off then you'll have a good time."
" Great comedy and surprisingly great acting
",0.9169,0.9903,2019-01-20 00:00:00,8,This was such clear campy fun but the casting and acting is actually and truly pretty great. I loved the original Pride and Prejusice as well as serious film versionsso I wasn't sure if this would be great or terrible. Turns out its hysterical though I think some bits would have been a lot less fun if I hadn't already known the original story.

",0.4404,0.9039,2019-01-17 00:00:00,8,"01/16/2019 A different kind of zombie movie. More like a slow building, multiple persons love story with a few zombies thrown in.

Why?Wonderful wealthy English movie sets coupled with majestic English countryside views throughout the movie. A good one time watch. Bon Appetit"

I do wish there were more zombies and less Austen in this movie, but it's well made with good performances and I'm glad I watched it."
" Only a terrific idea on paper...
",0.4767,0.954,2018-11-26 00:00:00,3,"I'm a man who likes his horror raw, shocking and extremely bloody. I can also handle pretty much everything else in terms of cinema, but I'm truly petrified of one thing: having to watch movies like ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""Atonement"" or ""Sense and Sensibility"" with my wife. I simply always fail to stay awake during those incredibly lengthy, tedious and dreadfully sentimental historical costume dramas. Therefore, the idea of Burr Steers' ""Price and Prejudice and Zombies"" seemed so appealing when I first encountered it! It has the romantic aspects and contemporary costume & set designs to please my beloved wife, and at least I could seek comfort in the fact there will be zombie mayhem after every sappy and melodramatic interlude. Giving this one an optimistic chance nevertheless became one of the bigger mistakes of the century, as ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is just as boring as the traditional Jane Austen adaptations and, moreover, a disgraceful entry in the horror genre, what with its horridly inept CGI-effects and anti-menacing zombies. Apart from the ""...and Zombies"" that is nonchalantly added in the title, Steers' ambitious project solely contains two reasonably imaginative gimmicks. Charles Dance's five beautiful and eligible-for-marriage daughters are all masters in Oriental martial arts techniques, and the noble but arrogant Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) uses ordinary flies as a primitive but highly efficient method to detect newly infected living dead people. Everything else is lame and derivative guff that is neither funny, nor exciting. I still think mixing two opposite genres or cinematic styles can work out perfectly fine, but for this to work, the writer and director must demonstrate deep respect and knowledge of both genres, which Burr Steers obviously lacked to do. In the competent hands of George A. Romero, for example, and with the much-needed help of Tom Savini in the make-up department, the potential outcome of such a genre salad could have been fabulous (perhaps)!"
" Something is amiss in the countryside
",0.0,0.9703,2018-11-01 00:00:00,7,"Surprisingly well done. It's exactly like the original book, except that in this version, England and the Bennet sisters are faced with a overwhelming threat: a plague of zombies inhabits the countryside. Those who don't fight back are destined to be turned into shuffling beasts in search of human brains. Some of it is quite silly, but it's fun to see the characters--and the actors--taking everything so seriously. Lily James and Sam Riley inhabit their lead roles without a hint of sarcasm or a knowing wink at the audience.The zombie threat and past conflicts with them are incorporated perfectly into the narrative, with a new angle: in this England, young woman are sent away to be trained in martial arts. Elizabeth and her sisters spend much time training with swords or flipping around, hacking off zombie heads. But there is real drama and romance among the characters--Mr. Darcy is a tool, Elizabeth is inexplicably drawn to him, Bingley and Jane Bennet make the perfect couple--but it seems they're constantly being interrupted by zombies at the gates.The writers did a great job of making it all feel fairly believable--London is under siege, ringed with battlements and a wide no-man's-land to protect the city. A limited number of bridges into the capital remain, guarded by the living. Each country manor home and stately castle is shown topped with new defenses and ringed with wicked, barbed fences and unbreachable gates. In the end, this movie is much better--and much better looking--than it has any right to be."
" Complete rubbish
",0.0,0.0,2018-11-01 00:00:00,1,"I don't get the idea of ""zombiefication"" of classic stories or characters. Or rather - I just get the urge for making and seeing movies with zombies - period!"
" Zombie action, comedy and horror with some classical literature mixed in.
",-0.296,0.9896,2018-10-30 00:00:00,9,"The story revolves around the young ladies of the Bennet family, Elizabeth (Lily James), Jane (Bella Heathcote), Kitty (Suki Waterhouse), Lydia (Ellie Bamber), and Mary (Millie Brady). In this version of 18th Century England, the countryside has been ravaged by a zombie outbreak. But amid the carnage and eating of brains, life goes on and young women must endeavor to marry well. To better survive the ravages of the undead, anyone with means sends their children to the orient to learn fighting arts. The wealthy send their children to Japan, and the wise send their children to China. The Bennet girls are alumni of the Shaolin temple. And where in previous incarnations of Jane Austin young ladies are playing harpsichord and doing needlepoint, the young ladies of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies are seen sharpening swords and cleaning flintlock pistols. They're also seen training for and engaging in combat with the legions of the walking dead. Sign me the F-Up .Yes the action sequences get a solid 9 out of 10. And the special effects are equally as good. But the truth is this movie is absolutely hilarious. It's funny because aside from adding zombies, kenjutsu and shaolin boxing, the writers kept everything else as faithful to Jane Austin as possible. I have seen Pride and Prejudice starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen quite a few times and much of the dialogue is identical, indicating that both versions stayed close to Jane Austin's original text. When real dialogue from the Pride and Prejudice is given while girls are cleaning muskets and sparring, it becomes gut wrenchingly hilarious. Zombie action, comedy and horror with some classical literature mixed in.

" Pride & Prejudice & Zombies & Swords & Martial Arts & Just...urghhhh.
",-0.2263,0.9498,2018-10-27 00:00:00,4,"Suffice to say, I didn't enjoy this. No point dancing around the inevitable conclusion. This just didn't work for me. Now, I'm sure the source material parodies Austen's original novel much more successfully than this adaptation does. Or, alternatively, the book may not sit right with me either. Like the undead, let's dissect this mediocre mess. Utilising the same characters, Elizabeth Bennett is caught in a love triangle but must also fight for survival against a horde of zombies. Hertfordshire has never looked so appetising. Flourishing with frocks, corsets and daggers strapped to provocative thighs. The authentic costume design is a stand out and certainly captures the period setting of rural England. The acting was good, particularly from James who continues to impress. So, why didn't I like it? Well, for me, the blend of genres didn't work and were unbalanced. By tagging 'Zombies' at the end of an already infamous title, one would expect the undead to take precedent and be at the forefront. Alas, the period romance took priority. Which would be absolutely fine if the actual adaptation of the 'Pride & Prejudice' story was decent. It's not. The romance, especially between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy, was more lifeless than the eponymous monsters. Riley was an incorrect casting choice and felt out of place. Smith provides the comic relief, and it seriously doesn't work. The story never feels involving, and it's impossible to not think about the several other adaptations that are significantly more engaging. However, the real issue that gets under my skin, are the zombies themselves. They talk. They go to church hearings. They disguise themselves as humans. I mean, call me old fashioned, but I like my zombies slow. I like them groaning. I like them actually being in a film for more than ten minutes. Practically none of it worked for me. Yes, it's watchable and is paced reasonably well. But the genres didn't blend and consequently produced a highly ineffective adaptation."
" Both funny and romantic

I have actually watched this movie three times this past week. The acting was great, especially the lead characters. They were very engaging and had great chemistry. For me this movie was a lovely, funny, romantic escape."
" A really pleasant surprise!
",0.7402,0.9968,2018-09-19 00:00:00,9,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that if you are a huge fan of the zombie genre or Pride and Prejudice, you are going to look on this film with disgust and horror!As a huge fan of the book of Pride and Prejudice as well as the BBC 1995 adaptation, I didn't really enjoy the Kiera Knightly version. The actors weren't the same, Darcy wasn't the same, there was no lake and it was just too short to fit the whole book into a couple of hours of screen time. So you can imagine my dismay when I heard about a film called Pride and Prejudice and Zombies! Added to this, I am also a huge zombie fan - World War Z (book AND film fan), Walking Dead, Shaun of the Dead - I love zombie apocalypses! As much as I love both genres, I was dubious to say the least about a crossover between a Regency period love story and zombies.My husband watched the trailer recently (I had disdainfully disregarded any thought of watching the film by this point) and said it looked well worth watching. As he seemed to be keen I grudgingly thought I would give it a go. I am so glad that I did!This film works in a way I never thought it would. Yes, there are zombies in Regency England. Yes, there isn't endless blood and gore as is usual with Zombie movies. But there is much more to this film than blood and guts. It's not stupid as I thought it would be. There is humour, love, a certain amount of creepiness, gender equality, class equality, - a zombie doesn't care if you're a man, woman, rich or poor; they're going to gobble up your brains regardless!It gives us a new breed of zombies - ones with brains that evolve (or devolve?) over time into something more and more dangerous. Fascinating idea.The casting was superb, however Matt Smith's Mr Collins was the best -he stole each of the scenes he was in and was hilariously funny but not to the point of slapstick humour. Just brilliant.The relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth was well portrayed and very, very touching. I almost preferred this Darcy and Elizabeth to the originals! The declaration of love at the end.... Well, there is many a romance film which could learn something from this.I could go on and on but I won't. I enjoyed it so much that, if it had been a 6 part mini-series which fully fleshed out the story, it would probably have earnt 10/10. As it is, I am giving it 9/10 - well worth seeing and I'll definitely be watching it again."
" Less prejudice more zombies please
",-0.11,-0.636,2018-09-11 00:00:00,3,"The story starts off as zombies, but then until the ending, it feels like a boring drama. If it had just a healthy dose of both, I would've liked pride prejudice and zombies. This movie just doesn't work for me, for almost the entire running time, I didn't care what was going on, the only parts I liked we're the zombie fights. Those are immediately ruined by boring sequences that follow."
" Better than your average zombie movie
",0.4404,0.9795,2018-07-16 00:00:00,7,"Once upon a time, I enjoyed zombies, but then they seemed to be everywhere, and I needed a break. Having never watched Pride and Prejudice, I liked the idea of zombies infecting this era. The costumes are great, and the effects are ok. I like that the zombies are kind of smart, so thats a nice twist. The girls all do some great butt kicking, and the story isn't too bad, what I'm assuming is stolen from the original material."
" Hit a Goofy Sweet Spot For Me
",0.4588,0.9972,2018-07-01 00:00:00,8,"I haven't read Jane Austen's classic novel Pride and Prejudice and I've never had the urge to. I read Sense and Sensibility and it wasn't my cup of tea. So, I turned this on with the hope that having a more contemporary element would make a story that clearly wasn't written for me, easier to sit through. I'm happy to report that it did and a large part of that was the humour that they incorporated into the narrative. Maybe other people saw it differently, but it just made me smile to watch people in this elaborate gowns and debonair dress slicing and dicing the undead. They establish the mythology (which was tightly written enough to satisfy me) and while they follow the beats of the original story, the zombie fighting is squeezed in and it works better than I thought it would have. It wasn't perfect, but I thought it was a pleasant surprise.So, while this movie departs from the classic story, my problems with Pride and Prejudice and Zombies don't have anything to do with those changes. The most noticeable flaw with this project is the sub-par effects and makeup. The budget on this is relatively low at $28 million (which was good considering how few people saw this in theatres) and unfortunately it shows. The costuming is good but with so many competing zombie TV shows (The Walking Dead) and movies (Zombieland) doing zombies so much better, it makes P&P&Z look even worse by comparison. I was also disappointed that the ending fizzled out. This could be blamed on the source material, but I don't see how. There's a considerable buildup with the rivalry between Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) and George Wickham (Jack Huston) and the movie seems to be preparing you for a bad@$$ zombie fight. But there's almost nothing when the resolution hits and while I can appreciate a credit stinger that seems to set things up for a sequel, I wanted more.Through the positives and the negatives, the big thing that this movie brought to my attention was how talented Lily James is. I had seen her in supporting parts in Baby Driver, Darkest Hour and the Exception (Downtown Abbey isn't my thing) but she's the lead heroine here as Elizabeth Bennet and she knocks it out of the park. She anchors this movie capably and I don't know if this movie would have worked without her. She's turning into a performer that I would tune into a show or movie I didn't know about just because of her involvement. I largely liked the rest of the cast, but I also want to credit Matt Smith as the Bennet's wimpy cousin Parson Collins. I'm not familiar with him as an actor but he had me laughing in almost every scene he appeared in. This is a movie full of strong characters and Parson is conversely so pathetic that it becomes easy to mine laughs out of him being such a tool. I also enjoyed Bella Heathcote, Charles Dance, Jack Huston and Lena Headey in their supporting parts.I can understand die hard fans of Pride and Prejudice turning their nose up to this. But I'm not in that camp and this movie made the Pride and Prejudice story palatable for me. I liked the tongue-in-cheek humour, how they decided to work in the zombie elements in and the movie boasts a dynamic lead performance from Lily James. Is it a landmark in screenwriting? Absolutely not but I did enjoy this movie from beginning to end. My true rating for this would be a 7.5/10 but I'll round up to 8/10. I would recommend this to people looking for an interesting mashup of genres, but I would also warn you ahead of time, if you're a fan of the classic novel, this film probably will seem like blasphemy."

" Unexpected delight!
",0.636,0.999,2018-02-20 00:00:00,8,"I finally got around to watching this, and laughed my head off, and I actually think Jane Austen would have as well. I'm not even a zombie horror fan, but this is such a great comedy, while retaining the power of the love story, that I still loved it. I don't feel it disrespects Pride and Prejudice; it's a homage more than a parody. It can't be denied that the story is made less character-driven - to put it that way, it's not INNER demons Elizabeth and Darcy are fighting anymore. However, it's still clear that the movie endeavours to take the novel's themes and love story seriously, and the actors, especially Lily James, play it straight and give it their all. I found the constantly leather-clad Sam Riley a bit lacking as Darcy, but Lily James would be a good Lizzy in any version of P&P. It's just, in this one, she is a martial arts champion as well. Another aspect that prevents this from seeming trashy, is that the production values and cinematography are surprisingly good. Apparently it was mostly filmed on location, and that shows.This also may contain the best Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet I have seen - though, granted, that may be because they are made more sympathetic than in the novel. Matt Smith is priceless and Sally Phillips hasn't got enough credit for her hilarious Mrs Bennet.The script and comedic timing are what make this an excellent comedy. I loved the historical revision that explains the invasion of period zombies in England - blamed on the French, of course. I loved how Darcy is recast as a zombie hunter and Lady Catherine as a warrior legend (Lena Headey was underused, though). I love the girl power element inherent in the fact that instead of embroidering, the Bennet sisters polish their weapons in their free time, and their deep conversations of love are had whilst doing combat training. I loved small directorial touches like the camera staying with Mr Collins after his unsuccessful proposal; we hear Mrs Bennet screeching off-screen followed by a quiet ""Bugger"" from Collins. I didn't see this in a theatre, but if I had, the scene where Elizabeth responds to Darcy's first proposal by *kicking him in the stomach* would have been worth the ticket price entirely!"
" Really quite well done

" Stop Ruining These Classics.

It's OK to make parodies sometimes, but this is neither parody nor a zombie movie. I enjoyed the romantic part of this story but sneered at the zombie part. Not quite sure what the intention of the people behind this movie was or what they were trying to say. If a movie doesn't deliver a message, it has to be entertaining. Other than that it's questionable. This movie is not OK with the zombie part. If we take out the zombie scenes, the movie wouldn't be ruined. Anyway, you will be entertained by the smooth dialogue between the actors and the romance in the story."
" Interesting idea followed through to moderate success and some laughs
",0.8625,0.9907,2017-12-06 00:00:00,6,"Putting the somewhat silly and naive P&P into zombie-land seems even more silly. But, they do follow through on this premise until the end. It kind of works. Story is somewhat ""watered-down"", but, it's still there. And there are zombies! :)There are some good jokes in there, which actually makes this pass the bar of acceptable. Without it, this whole exercise would have seemed rather pointless.I believe it would have been better if they explored more the very silly notion that zombies are so popular in this age and made more fun of the genre.The feminist element is not too much. Sure, it's silly that 5 girls do a better job of fighting the undead than a trained army of men, because, you know, they studied in China. But, it's not like the men simply get tossed around by zombies and the girls toss the zombies around.Other than that, Lily James is well cast as the main character and it's interesting that they even explore this - Darcy says ""she's pretty but not too pretty, has masculine features but is still feminine"", though it didn't get much comedic effect, so it kind of fell into the ""insulting the viewers intelligence"" category.The rest of the cast do a decent job, with the Mother overacting a bit and the Father actually underacting and Lena Headley is somewhat underused, but such is her part.Bottom line, it is an interesting and somewhat funny movie, worth a watch."
" The ultimate battle
",-0.3818,0.9457,2017-11-10 00:00:00,10,"The title pretty much says it all. The Bennet girls have been instructed in the orient in various martial arts, and when sisters fight, well, you get the picture. The film was more drama and romance than simple zombie fighting. Men propose at the drop of a hat.This production follows in a series of zombie films based on novels, ""My Fair Zombie"", ""Warm Bodies"" (""Romeo and Juliet""), that Asylum ""Sleeping Beauty"" thing, and ""Twilight"" with Kristen Stewart. Clearly this Zombie film had a serious budget. The movie followed the novel rather well (minus that one thing) as Lily James turned in an excellent performance unaccustomed to ""B"" movies.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity"
" One-joke book, become one-joke movie (though it's a pretty good joke)
",0.7269,0.7434,2017-10-29 00:00:00,4,"I read this book and it was a pretty good one-joke concept, taking a prim and proper piece of English literature (that also happens to be in the public domain) and inserting zombies. In movie form it's also a pretty good one-joke idea, but outside of that one joke, it doesn't sustain itself, same as with the book. The actors and production values are all of Downtown Abbey quality, though I may have enjoyed the genre mash-up more if the zombie action had gone for a hard R-rating instead of a tepid PG-13. Seeing Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy drenched in blood, as if they'd stepped off of set of ""Martyrs"" or ""The Descent,"" would have given the film a far more jarring of effect and possibly would have carried the concept for it's almost 2-hour running time, particularly if the violence and zombie action had gradually built to a wild ""Dead Alive"" type of over-the-top climax. The film either needed to hook audiences with the romantic tension of whether Ms. Bennett and Mr. Darcy will end up together or hook audiences with zombie action and suspense, but in only doing both partway, in the end, in film does neither and never hooks the audience."
" Action, Horror, Romance ....More specific : Parody
",-0.0258,-0.6812,2017-10-22 00:00:00,3,"So, where to begin. I love the story from Pride and prejudice I think it is one of the greatest love stories so elegant and charismatic but yet....in this case you just stare and wonder... how on earth did anyone had such an insane idea to mix together Pride and prejudice with Resident Evil? I basically watched the movie because I love the storyline from pride and prejudice and I want to see all ecranisations and also read the book 3 times but as far as this movie I will only recommend if you wanna have a good laugh and then give yourself a slap in the face that you actually saw it. There are some things that don't make any sense and the story moves so fast, boom now you are at the ball now you are in the middle of the battlefield and so on. But it doesn't make much sense this movie and I believe that his purpose was to be a Twilight parody with zombies than an actually romance action SF movie. Horror is an overstatement , because the horror part is that they keep show disfigured people and they keep cut their head off, so there is not for small kids but still horror is to much said, is a chick zombie flick :))"
" Misses the mark big time
",-0.2263,-0.1154,2017-10-05 00:00:00,4,"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES is undoubtedly a bad idea for a movie, a blackly comic misfire that misses the mark time and time again. The story is to take the essence of the Jane Austen novel and add a zombie apocalypse to the mix. I thought this was a ludicrous idea when the book came out and now, having seen the film version, I can confirm that I was right.The film's idea is to basically play out the plot of the original story but add zombies into the background of every scene. The zombie effects typically incorporate cheap-looking CGI while the action sequences are mishandled by the American director, who has no feel for his material.The only decent thing about this film are the presence of a handful of supporting actors such as Charles Dance, Jack Huston, and Lena Headey who do their best to make the whole thing bearable, but their efforts are in vain. Whether it's the miscast lead - Lily James, one of those pretty faces with nothing behind it - or Sam Riley's weirdly gruff accent, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES is an embarrassment all round."
" In this digital age, reviews can be misleading
",-0.4019,0.229,2017-09-30 00:00:00,7,"I had very low expectations before I see this film, mainly because of the raving bad reviews, 5.7/10 puts this movie in between bad and horrible. When I was watching it, I kept expecting the movie turn bad or boring ... never did, I mean, it is not Oscar worthy, but fairly entertaining and at times convincing. The visuals are beautiful, action sequence decent, even dialogue was made in ""Pride and Prejudice"" fashion ... I really don't understand where such low rating comes from. This makes me wonder how many of the reviewers have actually seen the film. IMO truly one downside of this internet age is everyone just blindly follows everyone else. No one seems to have his own opinion, or it is subject to be influenced easily at any given time."
" Less Pride and Prejudice! More Zombies!
",-0.3639,0.9662,2017-09-29 00:00:00,6,"Having seen many of the old - and slightly tired - screen adaptations of Jane Austen's book, I had been longing for a looser adaptation that would breathe new life into the story and would reflect a more modern representation of what counts as a strong female protagonist. Although I wasn't expecting a zombie parody to fully satisfy this need, I watched this film expecting a nice blend of comedy-romance-female badassery.P&P&Z can indeed be credited with some achievements (and even dare-I-say improvements to the original dynamics of the plot): the female characters are also warriors, there is an external motivator to the plot, other than the dull issue of who is going to marry whom, there is action and there is even the potential of well-justified character development and motivation for the two central characters (e.g. there's no much to justify the moodiness of Mr Darcy in the original, other than his minor family troubles, whereas in this one he is a seasoned zombie hunter who has seen and lived through a lot) The problem is that the film (sticking to the P&P&Z book, I presume, which is a parodic exercise) decides to keep whole chunks of P&P intact, retaining the original text and feel, despite the zombie apocalypse that's added into the equation. With that, it feels that we're basically watching two films at once, switching between the two every now and then. The parts that integrate both concepts organically are very few, while at times the mixture between the two elements is done unsuccessfully, resulting in caricature.I think the film should have taken itself more seriously, despite the ridiculousness of the premise, because it did have potential. If the P&P affiliation had been looser and the zombie apocalypse scenario had worked out as the main story-line, then we could have had a great movie.I still liked the comedic feel though - Parson Collins (Matt Smith) in particular was great."
" The title says it all
",0.0,0.9816,2017-09-02 00:00:00,5,"Just another adaptation of Jane Austen's novel but this time with zombies on the mix. The plot does not vary much from the original novel but contains these changes: instead of the bubonic plague, we have the zombie plague; the aristocrats, in addition to having a literary education, are also sent to China or Japan to learn martial arts due to the zombie threat; and the Bennet sisters, besides being beautiful and educated, are also fierce warriors with more childish than aristocratic ways. There is a part where Liz Bennet, instead of pushing her suitor away with the cynicism and coolness worthy of her social class, does not: they go into physical confrontation as if she were a ho discussing with her pimp in one of Bronx ghettos, only with refined language.The plot where zombies can talk and organize in community is poorly explained and could have been better explored. They should have put more emphasis on the zombies, as they have very little screen time. There is a part where one of the sisters sees the supposed 4 horsemen of the apocalypse facing back, but it is only this scene for a second or two; where do they fit in the middle of it all? We do not know because they never show up again. What purpose then has this scene?This film is only ""Pride and Prejudice"" in a zombie universe and nothing more, just to captivate more female audience to the zombie lovers wagon. As a final note I admit that production, costumes, direction, cinematography and performances are of very good level and in the end fulfills its function: to entertain and pass some time and then move on to better things."
" Needed more brains (from the writers)
",0.0,0.63,2017-08-20 00:00:00,1,"I love Pride and Prejudice. And I love Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (the book). I love so many adaptations of Jane Austen's work, but this one was terrible! The hilarious thing about the zombie adaptation was that it stuck pretty well to the original story. This was just a random, terrible zombie movie, with some well-known characters shoehorned into roles that were not at all consistent with how Jane Austen wrote them. If they were going to rip the entire story apart, they may have well just made a generic zombie movie. The book included fights with ninjas, Wickham getting maimed, and absolutely none of that made it into the movie. Instead, they invented some random plot that was not thought out well, and just muddled the entire story. Had the writer been stricken by the zombie plague when they wrote this?"
" Disappointed
",-0.4767,-0.6958,2017-08-11 00:00:00,1,"This movie is just a parody of someone who just watched the 2005 movie in a hurry and never bothered to read the book or something. The emotions were delivered ""in a hurry"" for the sake of action. Seriously, it made Pride & Prejudice look like some romantic old thing with no substance really and the action was so forced. Last but not least, the scene with Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth it's supposed to be heartbreaking in a way, not ""vase-breaking""."
" An action romp - see it for what it is
",0.0,0.2076,2017-08-06 00:00:00,5,Well I had planned to see this at the cinema....I'm glad I didn't.Some of the lines are just delivered rather lacklustre and it tends to drone on and in some scenes the players look very uncomfortable with each other.I do not know if he meant to play it this way but I felt the need to want to feed Matt Smith to the zombies and he greatly ruined any scene he was in.There were a couple of chuckles.I'd say watch on Netflix or DVD if you can but only free or rental.Action scenes are well done though and the visual effects and makeup are great.Sadly not enough to save it from slightly bombing.
" Better then expected
",0.4404,0.9685,2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"I didn't have high hopes going into this movie but the concept seemed very interesting. I must say it was entertaining. The love story aspect of it could have been better but the overall story was good. The zombies were well done, not cheesy at all. What's better then Victorian style dressed woman killing zombies with swords."
" Pride and Prejudice but where are the zombies...?
",-0.1154,0.9542,2017-04-21 00:00:00,4,"Granted, I haven't read the ""Pride & Prejudice"" book, nor have I delved into the ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"" that followed, and that is even despite the fact that I do enjoy everything zombie. So I am not sure how true director Burr Steers remained to the actual book.I eventually got around to sit down to watch the 2016 movie version of ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"", but I didn't have any expectations to it, given the fact that I wasn't familiar with the story in any way.And while this movie sure does have a good production value, it just falls through on the things that appeal to me; and that would be the zombies. There just simply weren't enough of them, and they were nothing more than backdrop elements to the story.The movie shuffled along at a slow, halting gait, so at least something zombiesque was here. But the storyline was just too slow and too boring to really appeal to me. Nothing much happened, and what did happen didn't really thrill me, because I cared nothing for the characters in the story.As for the characters, well they were one-dimensional and could easily have been replaced with cardboard cut-outs. There was absolutely no depth or personalities to the characters portrayed in ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"". So if the characters in the movie were copied from the book, then the book surely makes for a tedious and uneventful read.The acting, on the other hand, was adequate. Taking into consideration that the acting talents had next to nothing to work with in terms of storyline, script and characters.They had managed to capture the essence and feel of the time period quite nicely, in terms of costumes, wardrobe, props, sets, etc. And that was a nice treat to witness.And while the absence of zombies was terrifying, it was at least a treat that they did the zombie make-up and special effects adequately enough. Granted, it is not as gory and grotesque as what is seen in ""The Walking Dead"", for example, it worked out well enough for the premise of the movie.All in all, then ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"" wasn't an outstanding movie for me. And it is not one that I will be watching again, even with my fondness for all things zombie."
" Pride & Prejudice & Zombies : Review
",-0.2263,0.9744,2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"SPOILERI loved this film, being a fan of Jane Austen, especially of Pride and Prejudice, Burr Steers made a fantastic adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's book. During the film I was amused to say the famous quotes along with the actors. The fact that there are zombies did not change anything, on the contrary that made the film even more hectic and intriguing.The combat scenes were very well choreographed, especially the one between Mr. Darcy and Lizzy, in which one could see passion even though they were angry (except Darcy). The actors are fantastic, I loved Sam Riley in Malefic, Lily James in Cinderella and Douglas Booth in Romeo and Juliet.Burr Steers (Seth Grahame-Smith), demonstrated the strength of women in a historical context that are not conducive to this. Even though Lizzy has always been strong in character.I advise this film to all fans of pride and prejudice."
" Could have been more Fun
",0.5563,0.9626,2017-04-18 00:00:00,5,"Movies like this are having a hard time. Adapting a classic novel or story and adding some kind of monsters seems to be a trend in Hollywood. There are many really bad entries like ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"", ""Dracula Untold"" or ""The Brothers Grimm"". Now this is the second adaptation of a zombie novel by Seth Grahame-Smith after ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"", a enjoyable but mediocre movie.Exactly the same is to say about ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"". Let's start with the good parts. Easily the most enjoyable part is the main character played by Lily James. I don't know why she is not getting more attention. Besides her obvious beauty, she is really doing a great acting job here. Which leads me to the next positive part, the story part that's directly adapted from the Jane Austen novel. I wasn't expecting that much ""Pride & Prejudice"", but that worked and was portrayed very well.The demerits are the zombie parts of this movie. It felt randomly added to the plot. If you add zombies you should have much more fun, more darkness and horror, but instead most of the movies run time people are running into some zombies and killing them in fast cut scenes. And even in the end, where you could have started a fun fest of zombie killing it's just zombies running at them and never really being a thread.So in the end, I was disappointed, because the concept was wasted and could have been way more fun."
" 5.8 at the time of this writing. Really? Why all the hate?
",-0.6199,0.9761,2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"Don't understand the haters and critics. The film is well directed, well acted, with a very fresh twist of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". The costumes and scenery are top notch and very believable of the period. Even the zombies are done just right and not over the top gore. All the actors and actresses are very convincing in their characters and that keeps the audience engaging to the end. Even the color tones are just perfect through out the movie.Just for the entertainment value alone, this film should be rated much higher than 5.8. To be fair, it should be in the 7.5 to 8.5 range. I give it a solid 8."
" Mankind is doomed...
",0.0,0.9616,2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"Zack Snyder must have either been jumping for joy or writhing in jealousy over parts of this weird and wonderful movie. The director (somebody named Burr Steers) understood from the ground up what matters about this movie is less the zombie half than the Pride and Prejudice half, ie, beautiful women and pretty girls walking around in cleavage and cute smiles, wielding knives like ninja warriors and guns like bounty hunters. All of that nonsense was so artfully disguised in beauty and civility that the movie was a visual feast, and just might have the most plausible feel for the whole ridiculous zombie concept that I have ever seen.The director was smart enough to balance the typical dashing male lead with an elegant damsel, who wields her zombie killing sword with Crouching Tiger-esque skill and loveliness besides. Sadly, this won't become a model for future horror efforts, as movies continue to get dumber and dumber, where the watchability goes no further than a brilliant trailer and big special effects. I didn't understand half of what the heck everybody was cooing, mumbling and whispering about in this movie. But between the brains, beauty and breasts that decorated this gem of a story, it didn't really matter.The movie is a visual masterpiece. As complete an end of the world warning as has ever been made. Despite our attempt at cultured civility, man is a fallen, corrupted force in creation. The overriding reason for this movie comes from a line in the movie itself: ""the human race is surely doomed."""
" Jane Austen plus Zombies
",0.0,0.9972,2017-02-19 00:00:00,6,"I love P&P and had seen this book (P&P&Z) on the best seller lists but had no idea how it would translate from classic period drama to fantasy schlock-fest period drama. Turns out, quite easily and without much adjustment to the plot. Also, it was very entertaining to watch.It stuck closely to Jane Austen's classic original, keeping all the classic lines and characters; The Bennett family and Mr Collins, Lady Catherine de Burgh and of course Darcy and Mr Bingley. The difference being that there was a 1700s zombie uprising and girls of good character and accomplishment didn't just learn to read, sing, dance and play the pianoforte, sew and carry themselves with refinement and good deportment, they also had to be martial artists trained in either the Japanese or Chinese (depending on social standing) arts of zombie killing.Miss Jane Bennett (Bella Heathcote) isn't the beauty of previous P&P incarnations, and doesn't have the strong but quiet character as the eldest Miss Bennett, and seems younger and more like her mother, but Elizabeth Bennett (Lily James) the second sister, steals the show on every front. She really does have the most amazing eyes, and everyone would consider her a beauty. The three younger Bennett girls are seen and heard giggling but for the most part aren't in the scene except Lydia's unfortunate elopement. Mr and Mrs Bennett are played stoic and sensible, and flighty and silly respectively, and well, by Charles Dance and Sally Phillips. Darcy and Bingley Sam Riley (On the Road) and Douglas Booth are both great, my only complaint with Mr Bingley would be that he was far too pretty, to be historically correct – but then we're throwing caution to the wind with zombies so never mind. Matt Smith (Ex Dr) played the hapless and silly Mr – pardon, Parson – Collins well, and was suitably ridiculous, but a little too easy on the eye to be as odious and unappealing as he is meant to be – a problem with this production being everyone was younger and more attractive than they should be. Lady Catherine was the gorgeous Lena Heady for crying out loud! Generally the story kept to loose plot – Eliza being snubbed by Darcy at the ball and Jane's immediate attachment with Bingley Collins coming to choose a Bennett girl, Jane visiting Netherfield and catching cold, the balls, Darcy and Bingley's return to London, Mr Wickham's (Jack Huston) ingratiation with the Bennetts and all the subsequent toing and froing of affections. Jack Huston actually stood out as a good actor in this, but didn't have the slimy countenance of classic Wickhams. Then, there are the additions of zombies. All the way through the film we have opportunity for the Bennett girls (and I wondered where the other girls in Meriton were hiding) to show off their knife and musket skills with much showing of stocking and garter in the process, and heaving bosom. Fighting in corsets – whatever next? The fight scenes are good, though John Wick they are not, and you can see that most of the gore and action is actually off screen; blades are always clean (!) and lots of the hits on zombie actors are visibly wide of mark. It's not a particularly gory film, if at all, but the SFX of the faces of the zombies are very good and in places, very gross. This is not for young children.Enjoyable, funny and heavily recognisable as the classic, so entertaining from that point of view – the comparison – but lacking in emotion. I found I didn't really care for any of the characters, the ""twists"" were telegraphed a mile away, and I didn't find myself investing. It is a shallow visual immersion, although well-acted and sets, locations and costumes were done as if trying to be a big Hollywood film, but I just couldn't really care. I laughed, yes, but it was the comparison to the original that brought me most enjoyment (and that didn't have zombies in it – spoiler alert!) or homages to previous P&P films/TV shows – the Darcy swimming in the lake for example. Great Saturday evening watching, fun version for teens pre-GCSE to watch as ""study"" but not something I'd rave about or rush out to buy, although I would say it's definitely worth seeing."
" Neither here nor there, I am not sure what the movie set out to accomplish
",0.2115,0.9579,2017-02-17 00:00:00,5,"I imagine the pitch for this movie - ""Everyone loves Zombie movies, and also everyone loves Pride & Prejudice"". Unfortunately, I think that if one were to illustrate such a Venn diagram, they would find the overlap is very small, and that those of us who appreciate the crude humor and violence of zombie movies are not the same ""us"" who enjoy historical melodrama...However, this film does in fact- exist. As such, I do not think it is any better (or worse) than what is implied by its title (The most humorous point of the entire endeavor). This is a zombie movie set in the realm of Pride & Prejudice, and in order to enjoy it you apparently have to be better versed in the source material than I was. Overall - my favorite thing about this film was the opening alt- historical sequence ""An Illustrated History of Brittania"" which was created with such care and joy that I could not help but get roped in to the silly merriment."
" A one trick flick
",-0.0516,0.9556,2017-02-13 00:00:00,6,"I was in two minds as to whether this film was for me. On the one hand, I've watched every zombie film ever made (even the really bad ones that most people hate!). On the other hand, I've never seen Jane Austin's 'Pride and Prejudice' and I'm guessing she wasn't made a producer on this filmic adaptation (see, that's how much I know about that side of the genre – she is still alive, right?).In case you're not aware from the kind of self-explanatory title 'Pride and Prejudice with Zombies' this is a kind of mash up based on the classic tale, only throwing the undead into the mix for er comedy's sake I guess. I saw a few reviews of the film and the general take was that (believe it or not) it was actually quite a faithful version of the original text. And, by that I'm saying that it keeps to the original story's structure – even though I haven't reads it I'm pretty there weren't armies of flesh-eating ghouls rampaging through the Home Counties in Jane Austin's original vision. However, because I've never read the source material (or watched anything with Colin Firth in) I can't really comment on how accurate the story really is. All I know is that every once in a while, a load of zombies turn up and start trying to eat people, then the corset-wearing starlets all suddenly turn into Milla Jovovich from the 'resident Evil' franchise and start hacking the zombies to death with comparative ease (and stylish visual camera work).And that's about it really. It's a period piece interspersed with bits of zombie-slaughter. Yes, it's quite funny that a classic work of literature has been 'reimagined' in this way and the genres mixed, but, once you get over the initial cleverness of it all, there really isn't enough left for anyone. My mum loves Pride and Prejudice, but I can't see her really wanting to sit through this film. I love zombie films, but once the passing novelty of a 'period zombie film' had faded (and it does quite quickly) there was nothing here that I hadn't really already seen before.Basically, if you're looking for a period piece, watch a 'proper' adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. If you want a zombie film, watch 'The Walking Dead' or one of George R Romero's original trilogy. This is the sort of film that you could watch the trailer and see all the best bits included.However, although I'm probably sounding like I totally hated the film, I didn't. It's not a bad film, just not as original as it wants to be (and I wished it was!). Plus you have Matt Smith. Now I never was that fussed for him as a Doctor Who, but I thought every line he delivered was done with great comic timing and he really did lighten the mood considerably. Not bad, just a bit forgettable."
" Decent enough but does have some flaws
",0.0,0.9701,2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"During a ravenous zombie outbreak, a family of sisters trained in zombie eradication practices finds that their struggle is hardened by the constant need for them to settle down with an officer also fighting off the creatures and must fight their feelings to stave off the zombies.This one was an enjoyable enough effort. One of the more impressive elements here is the fact that this one manages to effectively intertwine the actual story into the middle of a zombie outbreak. The facet of their search that drives the main story, complete with each of the behavioral outbursts of each of the sisters that's brought over without any changes or updates, makes the period setting and generally decadent Victorian-era setting feel much more lived-in and comfortable than what should be considered for such a film like this. The constant yearning for stability in terms of suitors and the need for their comfortable surroundings is taken from the book and gives this a decidedly decent framework upon which to set-up the zombie outbreak in that universe. Those are of far-more impressive work here with the film really shining with it's action scenes here as the fact that the period-setting forces hand- to-hand tactics and swordplay rather than more traditional gunplay which makes this one quite enjoyable. The first battles in the family house where they crash the reception and do battle against them in the dance-hall makes for a nice start, while the incidental battles throughout the woods surrounding their house make for a stellar lead-in for the finale which has all kinds of great fun. The battle in the cemetery where the dead are shown coming back to life gets in some rather fun pieces, while the main brawl in the church basement with the freed zombies running loose gives this one quite a fun battle, while the brawling out in the fields and down into the bridge makes for a wholly enjoyable spectacle that makes for a fine time here. These here do hold this one up enough, although it does have some minor flaws with it. The biggest issue is the fact that there's just not a whole lot other zombie action within this one, tending to follow along too closely to the situations in the book rather than the plot set-up which would require more action to come from this storyline, and that does make the film feel far more stretched out than it really needs to be because it's inclusion of these story set-ups creates quite a rather downbeat and altered set- up that doesn't achieve what it could've. As well, the fact that this one tends to be quite a rather close interpretation might be quite hard for some to follow, with the chaste and rigid society structure and romance angles makes for quite a troubling effort to get through, which is quite a problem here. Otherwise, this one wasn't quite as bad as it could've been.Rated PG-13: Violence."
" Not Pride and Prejudice... Pride and Prejudice and ZOMBIES!
",-0.7693,0.995,2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"*** May Contain Spoilers*** I have to say, I'm surprised at such a low rating for this movie. That being said, I waited until it was on STARZ to watch it. I would also like to say that I had never read the Jane Austen book, nor watched any film adaptation of her book prior to seeing this movie. So, I went into this movie with no preconceived notions about what I thought it should be. I saw it for what it was, and nothing more. I also didn't expect much going into it.All that being said, I absolutely LOVE this movie! This movie had everything for someone that doesn't really take to romance stories. It had zombies. It had action. It had comedy. It had cringe worthy mortification. It had angst. It had romance. It had a bit of everything, that surprisingly worked well to bring a cohesive picture together and make an enjoyable fun movie for a Friday night with a bowl of popcorn.How do I even begin to say what I loved about this movie? I loved the interaction between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. I found their story more enjoyable to watch then even the zombie action. The interaction between these two actors was amazing. They had this incredible chemistry together on screen that I have rarely seen Lily James have with another co-star (Cinderella, anyone?). Sam Riley's portrayal of the silent, brooding Mr. Darcy was great. I'll hold any other actor to claim that role to his standard for the rest of my life. Their interactions made me laugh. I found them one of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie. The first time Mr. Darcy proposed to Elizabeth, I was floored. I had no idea it was coming. Indeed, I had no idea that he had any feelings for her aside from contempt. And when she attacked him, I cracked up. It was perfect. Yet, after watching the movie a second time, I saw the subtle signs that said he was infatuated with her, that were easy to miss if you had no prior knowledge of the source material, such as the scene when he's in the garden at night hacking away at the hedges with his katana, because he's hopelessly in love with her, and she continues to confound him.I also love the zombie aspect of the movie. Every absurdity in their society, every absurdity in their interactions, is all overshadowed by the never ending cloud hanging over their heads that at any moment zombies could attack and ruin everything. It lends the whole story a sense of urgency that otherwise would just make some of the silliness in their interactions contrite.After watching this movie, I became curious as to its source material, so I read the actual book and watched a six-hour film adaptation of it done in the mid 90's. By comparison, I still prefer this version of the story. Why? Because the writer while keeping true to the story, and actually using many of the lines from the book written by Jane Austin for the dialogue of the movie, cut out all of the long flowery speeches that made the original dull, and often times ridiculous. How many pleasantries can you say before you get to the point of what you are saying? This movie cuts out all of the excess, unnecessary dialogue and just sticks to the point, drives the point home, and moves on to the next piece of the story. Simple storytelling. I like that.I would love to see a Director's Cut of this movie, that includes some of the aspects from the book that were rushed out of it, such as when Elizabeth is introduced to Mr. Darcy's sister, and the ""feud"" between Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for Mr. Darcy's attention. I think some of that added into this movie could lend it a bit more enjoyability, tell more of the story, and still keep the zombie action moving.If you can put aside any predisposed prejudices you have for the original source material, and just accept this movie for what it is, and not what you think it should be, then you will enjoy it immensely. If not, then you will hate it. This is not Pride and Prejudice. This is Pride and Prejudice and ZOMBIES."

",0.0,0.9855,2017-01-25 00:00:00,6,"You may have heard about this and I guess there are many others that took either well known novels or history figures and webbed a horror theme around them (take Ab Lincoln Vampire Hunter for example). Does this work though? Or is it just a one joke thing that runs out of gas quickly even before it starts? I'd say the former.Of course that is in the eye of the beholder, but you can have fun with this if you let yourself. Of course if the obvious is not appealing to you, than you probably won't be convinced during the movie either. A nice touch is the strong woman fighter in this. Not a damsel in distress by any means! And that's good! I love it. Still this is not going to be a classic or anything, but is enough for an entertaining evening"
" I think Jane would like it
",0.3612,0.6152,2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"I have to admit that I'm somewhat disappointed to see the average rating of this film not climbing above 6. I would've expected it to be above 7.5 at least. Having said that judging by the box office receipts, many people disagree with me. So here's my take. I have read Pride and Prejudice and I've seen most of the TV and film adaptations. And of course the 1995 BBC adaptation is by far the best in my opinion and there is no finer Mr Darcy than Colin Firth. I believe that Sam Riley comes a creditable second to Colin in exuding the prideful, arrogant nature of Jane Austen's hero who falls to the conqueror of all of us, love. Lily James is an excellent Elizabeth Bennett again only second, in my opinion to Jennifer Elhe. Lily like Jennifer brought the strong, independent and fiery nature of Jane's Elizabeth to life. So why the poor reviews and box office receipts? The answer I suspect is that people could not accept the classic horror crossover. But I insist that it works. Mr Darcy being a respected soldier works, Elizabeth being a martial artist that can kick ass works. And has England been subject to a plague in its history. So I highly rate this movie, I've watched it about five times now and a fully believe that in a few years many will be looking back and saying hey this is a good movie."
" The only Jane Austen dramatisation I've ever enjoyed!
",0.5562,0.986,2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' manages to improve on both versions of the book (the original and the zombie version), with an exciting and entertaining plot, comedy that is actually funny, and plenty of action. I only wish that the book I was forced to study for O Level in 1981 had included zombies and swordfights. The characters were delightfully portrayed (the film gains from being played straight), and the use of so much of the original dialogue gives it a curious air of authenticity – reminiscent of 'Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell'. The locations and costumes are lovely, and Lena Headey is especially stunning as the eye-patch wearing veteran warrior Lady Catherine. Matt Smith as Mr Collins is hilarious, rather than simply irritating. I would recommend this to anyone who was bored out of their mind by the original."

Something like ""trashcan"" or...I don't know. Honestly, I'm 36. I literally grew up on good and bad zombie movies. But this - this is deep below bad. How even somebody could make this movie? It was like that some guy came into the studio and said: ""Hey, let's take some classic novel and spice it up with lepers!"" And boss answered: ""Yeah! It's great idea! But leprosy is not funny anymore... What about zombies?"" And after few months on crack and heroin they finished this? Or what?"
