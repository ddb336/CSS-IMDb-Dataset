" the fight is still going on.
",-0.3818,0.8481,2020-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Biographical documentary about internet prodigy Aaron Swartz. From home-movies of his childhood and use of computers at a young age to his death early 2013. It's interesting to find out about all of his resume, going beyond his famous involvement in the making of RSS 1.0 and the automatic download of academic papers which caused his arrest. The movie is dense and interesting considering schwartz's short lifespan. he started really young to do relevant work in the matter of the web : rss, creative commons, reddit, and setting free a lot of court records out of the hands of for-profit corporations, the guerilla open access manifesto and his involvement in the anti-sopa demonstrations. I thought this movie, beyond schwartz made a great job at showing the conflicts in between the capitalist start-up culture and the fact that the public web was created as a non-profit tool, and all of the consequences of these contradictions when it comes to copyright issues and the freedom to access information. the fight is still going on."
" A must documentary, everyone should know about Aaron Swartz
",0.0,0.8126,2020-09-11 00:00:00,8,"This is the story of Aaron Swartz and a must watch for anyone who loves computers, programming and loves Reddit."
" Why? I believe I know.
",0.0,0.7367,2020-02-04 00:00:00,10,"It's not a spoiler to say that Aaron killed himself. So I'm going to tackle that subject alone very quickly after discussing the merit of the documentary.
This documentary was masterfully created and hits off to those responsible. This is a must see for anyone that wishes to know truths over self indulgent security blankets.
To see his loved ones and colleagues talk about Aaron throughout this film, knowing ahead of time what transpired was heartbreaking. Yet at the same time it was well worth the time to understand more about the young man. The genius young man. Patriot is the word I'd use to describe him. Humanist is another.
I believe I understand why he killed himself. To me, it seemed that he had spent so much of his life trying to show people the way things could be, if not should be. And he was afraid the battle he was currently fighting was being lost. Aaron was analytic in his thinking. He saw patterns and had an understanding of the consequences of actions. He could see the ""grand picture"" so to speak. He knew that his death would bring an awakening, a shockwave across the continent, if not the world, because of what he was fighting for. I believe he believed his sacrifice would not be in vain. His analytic mind could see the difference his sacrifice would make.
I could be completely wrong, but I don't believe I am. Is goal seemed to be to make a difference in the world. It wasn't for money or fame, but a better world for others to live in. He could see the bigger picture, and for that he gave himself for a cause. This type of story has been around for thousands of years. There are no supernatural elements to it, just a pure of heart trying to make things better for others. And that is his legacy."
" If you have any doubt that technology can still be used for good
",0.1027,0.743,2019-11-17 00:00:00,9,"In a time when technology seems to be so often used to erode the gains of past political struggles, this movie is some much needed optimism about the possibility of using the internet for good."
" Something's missing
",-0.296,-0.9724,2019-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Everything in this documentary seems to fit except one thing. At the end of the film, friends of Aaron get to answer how was it like when they found out about Aaron's death. The documentary does not comment on his ""suicide act"". Instead, the film crew and the participants on the interviews reffer to it like a true event, like this is how it happened.
I do not believe it makes sense. I do not believe that Aaron had any reason to kill himself, on the contrary a court case like that would be a critical moment for the government. His case must be examined thoroughly and for me his death raises obvious suspicions. He appears a victim of capitalist greed. His open access advocacy had to be silenced and what better way than by making murder look like suicide.
There was no private autopsy and forensic examination done and we know how prosecutors notoriously lie, plus medical examiners and the media help them.
I am concerned about this film because, out of the blue they just announce to the viewer that some days before his court and after he had refused to agree with the government's conditions so he can avoid years in jail, that means he had to PLEAD GUILTY FOR FRAUD, he took his life. It just does not fit.
Something is missing from the story, a piece of hidden truth maybe?"
" The only thing that can stop them is people RISING UP
",-0.296,-0.9678,2019-10-26 00:00:00,10,"My heart is shattered in thousand pieces. what a sad tragic loss. his soul, his beautiful soul has touched my life in so many ways. it drives me mad when thinking about the society, the government, its injustice laws led such brilliant soul driven to suicide. the world we're living in, the society, the governments, they are all overwhelmingly brutal and when you start questioning the system, the way Aaron did, you start realizing that ""In a time of deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."""
" The film not only canonizes its hero but worse (Somehow)
",-0.431,-0.5264,2019-09-21 00:00:00,7,"The Internet's Own Boy, ""a riveting documentary about the life and tragic death of computer whiz Aaron Swartz, does not apologize for his loyalties. Not only does the film canonize his hero, who committed suicide in the midst of a nasty federal indictment against him, but it also brushes off any big picture worries about national security and Internet piracy.Nevertheless, the gripping, well-researched film by director Brian Knappenberger makes a compelling argument that the U.S. authorities went overboard in their zeal to set an example from the brilliant Swartz, who found it difficult to download 2 million MIT research papers."
" Heros are among us
",0.3182,0.9521,2019-05-16 00:00:00,10,"A story about a hero. I was so touched by this movie that I felt I had to write my first review. The film presents emotions and strength that one boy had in himself. His ideas, his plans and will to make the world a better place must touch all of us.This is not a ordinary documentary movie. It doesn't just show the story of Aaron Swartz, it makes us wonder about justice in this world. Who creates the justice and who controls it? I have read somewhere that this is a ""must watch"" film for every computer user. I totally agree, but would recommend the movie to every person just to watch it and ask himself a lot of questions about how this world works and why like that?"
" A Real Revolutionary. Truly an Inspiration.
",0.743,0.976,2018-08-04 00:00:00,10,"The story of a most brilliant, brave boy who took on the injustices of our modern technological world and its corrupt conspirators in government and corporations, who try suppress the truth. with a passion unlike any other, and a sense of justice in the true sense of that misused word, he was david in the battle against goliath and we are forever indebted to what he has done for our freedoms and rights, so we wish him peace and wellbeing in this life and the next, om namah shivaya om"
" A troubling story in troubling times
",-0.7906,-0.1353,2017-04-13 00:00:00,9,"Even beyond the troubling aspects of a national culture in which a government and its functionaries could target a talented and altruistic young man with such extreme malice and vengeance, it seems we need to ask how Swartz, with so many intelligent and sensitive friends and colleagues, could still become so isolated and despondent as to take his own life.This film is a hugely interesting and informative one, but I believe it still falls far short of telling us everything we may want to know about Aaron Swartz, who I can't help but think was a young David who was, in effect, slain by a Goliath."
