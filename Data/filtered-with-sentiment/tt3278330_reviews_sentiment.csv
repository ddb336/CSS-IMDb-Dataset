" Beautiful film with good story
",0.7783,0.5994,2021-03-18 00:00:00,7,The cinematography is gorgeous and worth watching the film for. The separate storylines are generally well-told and entertaining but the thread connecting them together might be a little too bare.
" Passionate...
",0.0,0.9353,2021-02-28 00:00:00,9,"Adorably insane and bizarre, in the style of the short stories I love, a dark humor, associated with animalistic characters, like the bear and the flea, the young old witches, all magically built, but slowly developed, the dragging rhythm is a little uncomfortable ... I fell in love with this tangle of characters, in a super captivating story, there's no way to be enchanted with so much magic... Passionate..."
" Solid Adaptation of Fairy Tales
",0.1531,0.9992,2021-02-19 00:00:00,7,"This was a movie that I'll be honest, I never heard of. It popped up on Letterboxd for horror films so I decided for Italian horror month to check it out for my podcast as Italy was its country of origin. This is a type of anthology where we have 3 interconnected tales involving three different kings. The synopsis is from the bitter quest of the Queen of Longtrellis (Salma Hayek), to two mysterious sisters who provoke the passion of a king, to the King of Highhills (Toby Jones) obsessed with a giant flea. These are tales inspired by the fairytales by Giambattista Basile.We start this off following what appears to be a clown. There are others that make up what looks to be a circus and we see they are there to perform for the Queen and King of Longtrellis (John C. Reilly). He is enjoying what they're doing, but the Queen not so much. She leaves in anger when she discovers one of the performers is pregnant. We learn that the Queen cannot conceive. Their fortunes change when a Necromancer (Franco Pistoni) tells them a way. The King then goes to kill a sea monster, but he dies in the process. From this beast, its heart is prepared by a virgin and Laura Pizzirani is selected. The Queen must eat it and she will become with child. This virgin also becomes pregnant when breathing in the vapors while it is being prepared.It is at the funeral procession for the King of Longtrellis do we meet our other kings. There's King of Strongcliff (Vincent Cassel) who gives into the lusts of the flesh and also the King of Highhills who has a daughter.From here, the movie takes us 16 years into the future. The Queen of Longtrellis has a son of Elias (Christian Lees) who is albino. He has befriended Jonah (Jonah Lees) who looks exactly like him. The Queen forbids the two from being friends and threatens to send the commoner away if they do not heed her warnings. The two are connected though much more than she cares to believe.The King of Strongcliff continues to lead his life of debauchery. He's entranced when he hears the singing of Dora (Hayley Carmichael). When he goes to see her, she refuses to open the door. The reason is that she is old and ugly. She lives with her sister Imma (Shirley Henderson). They come up with a way of staving off the king, but in the end, he's going to want to see the woman with the beautiful singing voice. She isn't what he's expecting though and Imma doesn't want it going too far. She will do what she has to though if it means losing her sister.There is then the story of King of Highhills. His daughter grows up to be Violet (Bebe Cave). She's heard the beautiful tales of knights and chivalry. Her father doesn't want to lose her. He becomes obsessed though with this magical flea. It grows to a monstrous size, but unable to support itself. He sees a way to ensure he never loses his daughter, but that backfires when an Ogre (Guillaume Delaunay) enters to guess the hide that is displayed.I think that is where I'll leave my recap of the movie. That gets you up to speed what the three stories we will follow without giving away too much. I didn't know that these were fairy tales from Italy, but I thought it was pretty cool. They're not ones I'm familiar with so they are fresh. It would be interesting to see if people growing up there if they are common knowledge.Being that they are fairy tales, they are interesting cautionary tales here with a good message. The Queen of Longtrellis is willing to do whatever it takes to have a son, even sacrifice her husband. The problem then becomes not wanting to give up her son. He's a bit young to be married from the looks, but she doesn't even want him to have a friend in Jonah. She sends him away and this causes Elias to leave her to find him when he discovers he's in trouble. This leads to an interesting showdown with a monster that isn't what it seems. Sometimes we become the monster we don't expect.The King of Strongcliff story is interesting to have Cassel playing the lead. He does so well at living this lifestyle of debauchery. Being that he's a king, he can do whatever he wants. When he falls in love with Dora's voice, she knows that he will never love her, but she likes the attention. Imma tries to prevent it as it leads them down this path of destruction and ruin for the two of them. There's a bit of getting the taste of something better and not wanting to give it up. We also get the 'what are you willing to give up for a better life' angle as well.King of Highhills is another odd one as well. He has this beautiful daughter. She's heard these fairy stories of knights and love. She wants that. As a princess, it would be expected that he would marry her off to a similar family. Instead, this king gets caught up in this magical flea he finds. I like his discovery is while Violet is playing a song on a lute she wrote. It appears he is ignoring her, which in a sense he is. I don't feel it is intentional though. He really has no plans to marry her off and sets up a game that he thinks is unbeatable. That is until the Ogre shows up. Now this isn't a monster one like Shrek. It is just a mountain man who has grown to quite a large size and is uncivilized. This takes a strange journey to Violet becoming a strong woman for sure.Where I think I'll go next is the acting. We have some heavy hitters here for sure with Hayak, Cassel, Jones and Reilly. They're all really good in their performances. Despite them being the stars of the movie technically, I'd say it really is more of Henderson, Carmichael, Cave and the Lees brothers. I really like Henderson as Imma. She wants to just live her life, but Carmichael messes this up with the King showing interest in her. They both get punishments in different forms. Cave was really good as well as Violet. I think she has some of the best growth to where she ends up. It is really showing her losing her naivety and coming of age. I'd say aside from that, the rest of the cast rounds this out for what was needed.What I also thought was good was the effects of the movie. This is visually stunning. I do need to give a lot of credit to the set-pieces they have here. They really did look amazing and feels like we're in this fictional world it is set. There are practical effects here which also looked good. The giant flea and the sea monster would fall into this. There is some CGI for both of these that don't look amazing. It isn't overly important and small part of the movie so I won't hold it against the movie too much. The costumes and everything there were also on point for me.If I do have any issues with this movie though, it would definitely be that it runs too long. We're clocking this in at 134 minutes. It does make sense to run a bit longer as we have to introduce 3 stories, give us the crux of what will be the downfall and then having it end as tales like these tend to do. I did find myself bored though near the end of the second act, going into the third. It does bring me back in, but I think there's some fat that could be trimmed in my opinion.So with that said, this is still a movie that I found interesting. We have some cautionary tales here that I wasn't familiar with. It feels fantastically with some of the elements like giant sea monsters, fleas growing to epic sizes and even a witch thrown in there. It does have social commentary that you can pull from it, even though it is a period piece. I thought the acting was good. No real glaring issues with the effects and the soundtrack fit for what was needed. Overall I'd rate this as above average overall, but just lacking a bit for me to really go higher at this time."
" Very Enjoyable
",0.4927,-0.4652,2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Basically, this is that type of movie that you have to start to know if it's for you or not. Don't get influenced by the bad reviews.
Usually I don't watch this type of movies because they tend to be very slow and boring. Despite the bad reviews I read here, I decided to give it a try as Salma Hayek appears on it. And after watching it, I have to say that I really enjoy it, the stories are quite predictable but with a ""plot-twist"" that make them somehow unpredictable."

I have no words to explain the disappointment I felt after watching this movie. It should be relegated to the cutting room floor, never to be aired again."

" Mixed Bag
",0.0,0.9547,2020-11-10 00:00:00,7,"This film was a monumental undertaking, so beautifully filmed and often lyrical yet the many tales do not piece together so well, the cross cutting from story to story seemed disjunct at times, lacking a common thread to maintain what is never quite a story as a whole. Perhaps as the Ballad of Buster Scruggs, this would have been better as separate stories with occasional overlapping characters.
As it stands for all this it is well worth watching and in many way marvelous. A real mixed bag here."
" As usual, huge enthusiasm or appalled rejection.
",-0.3182,0.9011,2020-07-27 00:00:00,8,"This is yet another example of how viewers can either buy in to a radical project or else feel so outraged by it that they often not only give it low ratings but try and stop others even sampling it. Personally, I'm one of the lucky ones when it come to this film. I found it to be a rich, satisfying and sometimes terrifying experience, wonderfully exemplifying the deeply realistic understanding of human nature of the original story makers. Try it!"

One is as low as they will let me rate it.The only thing interesting about this movie is the fact that someone fooled the producers into spending money to make it.When the credits roll at the end you will literally stare at the screen and say to yourself what in the hell just happened.Please do yourself a favor and never watch this movie.Also, anyone who has reviewed this movie that gave it good reviews, mark them down as having no taste, and never listen to any review they ever give.You will thank me later.Garbage movie."
" Pointless
",0.0,-0.7201,2020-05-15 00:00:00,1,"Incoherent, pointless and going absolutely nowhere.
Chaotic story, badly written and you can put the best actors in the world in it, but it will always be a disaster.
Absolute waste of time."
" Three separate fantasy tales -- no connections.
",-0.296,0.9552,2020-05-10 00:00:00,4,"Three interspersed, but not interweaved, fantasy tales. The cinematography is amazingly clear and beautiful, and many scenes are worthy of paintings by the Old Masters. But nothing much of interest happens. The tales' scenes are alternated but have nothing to do with each other, except perhaps to occur in the same medieval universe. Many times I thought ""Which story are we on again?"" None of them are particularly compelling and certainly not uplifting."
" Interesting and unique yet ultimately disappointing.
",-0.128,0.7798,2020-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Tale of Tales is interesting and unique -- two things sadly lacking in this age of sequels and remakes -- but the stories were little more than a collection of scenes that never created a greater whole, and neither did the stories merge or intertwine except in the most cursory way. Overall it felt like a missed opportunity to create something better if only they'd put as much effort into developing the story as they did the visuals."
" A film on fairy tales as brutal as original faity tales
",-0.4215,0.8493,2020-03-14 00:00:00,9,"What a wonderful fantasy film! It is quite innovative, as it keeps original brutal and macabre spirit of old fairy tales instead of softening them as most movies do (Disney is the most obvious example, but almost all the others do the same, with less competence). It is interesting that instead of chosing a dark cinematography, as the film is so sinister, the choice was for a colorful one, which emphasizes the magical envirionment. Director Matteo Garrone and the other writers did a good job adapting some tales of Giambattista Basile's 'Pentamerone'. Instead of bringing to the screen the most famous - Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella -, they chose to merge three others in which they could highlight women issues in different atages of life: youth (The Flea), mildlife (The Enchanted Doe) and elder age (The Flayed Old Lady). All actors perform very well, costumes and makeup are perfect, director Garrone was able to explore that dazzling discomfort Terry Gilliam portrays so well in this films. Sone monsters appear, and they are organic and fearful as we would supposedly consider them if they were in front of our sight in real life. The movie is violent, not only for some explicitness, but also because it pulls out, viciously, deep feelings and concerns of human beings and exhibit them for expectators, naked and undisguised. This is not obe more fantasy flick, this is unique and memorable."

" Like a very long prologue for a film that never connects
",0.3612,0.9681,2019-07-30 00:00:00,5,"Incorporating three art fairy tales (that is: Not folk fairy tales, but written ones) of which only one is well portrayed, the film becomes a bit of a mess.
It succeeds in depicting three rather disconnected kingdoms, with a narrative in each.
The only one that really 'works' is one about a king's affection to a monster (!) which leads him to making a monster of his daughter (!!) by marrying her to a completely different monster (!!!). A bit constructed? Well, there you have it.
The other stories are about a particular king, and a pair of magic twins born out of the queen's wish to become a mother - sacrificing her king and more in the process.As said in the headline it all seems a tad like a prologue - the stories never connect properly, and the points of each story flyes a bit in the wind.Great cast, though, but actually a hard watch. Manages to create bleak worlds, but also to obscure three rather simple stories..."
" Flawed instant semi-classic that; as good as attempt at putting fairy tales on the big screen as we could ask for.
",0.4404,0.9954,2019-06-16 00:00:00,7,"A visually marvellous attempt to translate the vintage fairytale to a the big screen. It is not a ""modern fairytale"" or a ""dark take on fairytales"" it feels in every way the authentic narrative a culture simply converted to the cinematic medium.Filled with stunning costume, architecture, landscape and design, they don't miss a trick with the use of colour like a masters painting.""Hey honey I'm thinking we need a room that's all white"".""Why is that?""""If we ever do anything macabre in it, it will look so boss.""The narrative of the movie is essentially three loosely connected storylines but which themselves feel like a set of short fables. It never stagnates, there is always some new element to play around with but not in an overwhelming way.There is a superb sense of whimsy and lyricism that never quite feels childish, juggling humour and intrigue with an ineffably disquieting undertone. I wouldn't call it a horror but when you're in the mood for a horror I think this will do much better than what most of the genre have to offer.The problems are in the details and the plot logistics: just because you're audacious and beautiful in your handing doesn't mean that you still can't fall down in other ways. Impeccably visualized and with an enchanting score, one find they may often have to meet the plot halfway since some actions occur without any real explanation. I know it's meant to be like a fairytale but still...The Two Sisters story line doesn't seem to know exactly what it want to do with itself. It's very hard to understand exactly what the motivations of the characters are and I don't think they meant it to be as mysterious as it is. They came up with some brilliant music overall but they succumbed to what I call ""City of stars syndrome"". They found one really excellent melody and just played it ad infinitum for this particular storyline thus killing the impact. They also shoehorn some macabre for its own sake and too many plot devices are just magic people springing out of nowhere.There's an unfortunate use of (admittedly pretty good) CGI which really clashes with the tone of the movie. They could have made a much better effect with puppetry or animatronics.Also, they had no idea how to end it.But overall a movie you won't soon forget that you'll be glad you saw despite a lot of small issue."

" Good story with fantasy, different from Eastern magic stories.
",0.4404,0.8271,2019-02-03 00:00:00,7,"The structure is clever thus the three stories were well organised alternately. In traditional Chinese tales, the key senses of worth is common, i.e., introduce the rule or philosophy of the world, such as retribution and honesty. However, the western tales are full of horror.

" Gorgeous, Twisted Fairy Tale Anthology
",0.6124,0.5404,2018-12-03 00:00:00,9,"Absolutely staggered by this!It came on late on a Sunday night on Channel 4 and I decided to give it a go, and was not disappointed.If you love classic fairy tale films like 'Willow' and 'The Princess Bride', loved 'The Fall' and don't mind a handful of boobies and a wee bit of blood, you'll have a lot of fun with 'Tale of Tales'.People on the reviews here seem to forget that all the fairy tales we were told and we teach our kids are based on crazy-dark original stories (eg, the ugly sisters in Cinderella cutting their feet up to fit the slipper, etc) so it's a bit silly to get squeamish over not very much gore at all.I regretted not 'taping' it as soon as I'd started watching it, and already had stuff lined up on my Sky box, so couldn't +1 it, so it's going to be one of the rare films I go out and buy on DVD. That's not happened since 'District 9'.Love. It."
" Long, slow and empty
",-0.2023,-0.5044,2018-12-01 00:00:00,3,"Frankly I don't understand the positive reviews for this film at all.OK - the cinematography is at time magnificent. Lots of attention to detail in the scenes, costumes and props. That's it - that's pretty much ALL this film has to offer.It's a mash-up of a few assorted fairy tales, with some dark edges. Others have mentioned dark humour, but the darker scenes are intended to discomfort the viewer rather than entertain. I love black comedy - this isn't it. In places, it's like they've tried to copy Monty Python, without actually understanding Monty Python.Many of the film's moments are dragged out with a very annoying soundtrack turned up. The whole thing screams, ""look at me, look at me, aren't I a wonderful film"", except it isn't.You press on regardless because you think, all these tales, how do they come together - I mean, you're not enjoying the experience, but you're still intrigued. Sadly, they don't. The tales just fizzle out, separately, and pointlessly."
" Hollow
",0.0,-0.8132,2018-10-16 00:00:00,5,"TALE OF TALES is a bizarre, sprawling, fantasy anthology that weaves three separate dark fairy tales into one unwieldy whole. It suffers from being overlong and averagely written, lacking interesting characters for the most part and getting by with familiar tropes rather than genuine insight or innovative scenes. Of the stories, there's a brief one with John C. Reilly and Salma Hayek as unhappily married king and queen; a lengthy one about witch sisters looking for love; and a plain bizarre one in which Toby Jones nurtures a giant flea. Some of the effects and scenery look quite nice, but there's a real hollowness to the storyline that lashings of sex and violence can't hope to fill."
" But what about...??
",0.0,0.0044,2018-09-27 00:00:00,6,"Absolutely gorgeous film that makes no sense whatsoever. I wouldn't mind, except right from the start it leads you into thinking that the following events are somehow connected or going to resolve together. But they don't. 
About two thirds through it becomes honestly quite boring and predictable until we reach the end. Or, that is, if it had an end. It doesn't. It just stops suddenly with little to no resolution and a freaky, unanswered question.
Unnecessarily graphic - the gore and on screen sex add absolutely nothing to the production. It could have had a touch of humour or charm to offset the misery and bleakness, but both are in very short supply. Few of the characters have enough dimensions to begin forming a meaningful relationship with the audience. It's quirky, it's kind of unexpected and very well made. Provokes many thoughts and then instantly crushes them. 
If you like to leave a film feeling dissatisfied then this is for you."

Multiple, loosely connected fairy tales set in a far off time. Thoughtful (maybe?) allegories behind those tales. Beautiful visuals and scenery. Yet, most everything else about this film is lacking. The pace, the connectedness, the depth, and the delivery... all leave the audience wondering ""why am I watching this?"". Sadly, at the end of the 2hr+ commitment, we've still not been given a good answer to that question, and what's left is a forgettable film that was a bit of a chore to make it through, but which had enough potential that it really could (and should) have been good, if not great."

Those are adult fairytales as there is some nudity and a tiny bit of gore. It's weird and sometimes absurd but it's entertaining and that's what it's all about when you watch a movie like this one. The cinematography was very good so for that alone it's worth a watch. The cast is a mixture of well known actors like Salma Hayek, Vincent Cassel, Toby Jones and John C. Reilly, and lesser known but not lesser talented like the twin brothers Christian and Jonah Lees. It's an easy movie to watch, not complicated at all, with strange creatures as almost all fairytales have.

(think of the movie as a slight alteration margaret cavendish's the blazing world with its wonderfully bizarre creatures and exploration of females in power with some extra 'guilty pleasure' stories. i'm aware that this might sound confusing, but i'd just suggest you read that book before watching this; there are some intelectually stimulating parallels which can be drawn.)"

Imagine watching something like, The Departed, and as soon as the elevator opens up on Lenonardo DiCaprio the screen goes black. Yeah, like that"

In one, a queen desires a child, so the king slaughters a sea monster and she eats the heart, but she focuses more on making the prince follow her orders than on letting him have a friendship. In another, a king spends all his time raising a flea, ignoring his daughter until he decides to marry her off. In the last one, a king is infatuated with a woman until he finds out that she's old, but then she puts on a facade.If you've spent your life knowing only the sanitized versions of fairy tales, then Matteo Garrone's movie will be a real shock: no singing, no cute animals (but there are some scary ones), and no happily ever after. The dialogue is more concentrated in certain spots, allowing the action to be the main focus elsewhere. There's still a lot in the way of aesthetics - palaces, costumes, hairdos - but this is truly a dark fantasy. After all, it's not every movie in which a queen eats a sea monster's heart (with blood smeared all over her face). Not a masterpiece, but still an interesting look at fairy tales, much the way that ""Into the Woods"" is. I recommend it. A real feather in the cap of Salma Hayek, John C. Reilly, Toby Jones, Vincent Cassel and Shirley Henderson."

The third involves a lustful king tricked into spending the night with an old woman.The three tales swap back and forth in case you get bored. The cinematography was grand and better than the plots, whose theme appears to be: Be careful what you wish for and something to do with birth and death.

If you see the label fantasy and think it will be like Lord of the Rings, you are way off, and probably will be disappointed. It is definitely a fantasy but it is more like Pan's Labyrinth, but not really either. The best I can put it, it's different.Somewhat based on the Giambattista Basile's (I hadn't heard of him before either, but kind of interesting to look up) collection of fairytales. The movie therefore has several different subplots, very lossely connected (i.e. not at all really more than that the characters meet sometimes).The movie is no stranger to either nudity, sex or gore but it is not the highlights of the movie it all. It is just... there. The movie is more about different kinds of obsession. The pace of the movie is slow (sometimes refreshingly so) and not everything is explained. A lot of the stories you got to figure out yourselves, and somethings are never resolved. A movie fun to watch if you want to test something outside the mainstream blockbuster cinema."

Why any actor would want to participate in a movie like this beyond my comprehension but work is work I suppose. Other reviews go on and on about how this is such a collection of cautionary tales about the human condition but that is a bunch of nonsense. This is nothing more than an overblown waste of time and an exercise in being weird for the sake of being weird. If you want cautionary tales about the dark side of the human condition then watch reruns of the Twilight Zone or Tales from the Darkside. Both are more concise and entertaining than this awful movie.

The actors are engaging, the characters are original and brilliant and funny, the script never falters, the visual effects are good (but not CGI), the ideas brilliant and the stories themselves very, very moving. Similarly I took a point off as the three featured tales don't really intersect with each other except at one point, and it wasn't quite clear to me why three sovereigns all lived in almost the same valley. My thought after watching it was that somewhere in my childhood this movie should be ringing a bell. There is something very Grimm or Aesop about this work, very European.

" 3 Medieval Tales Not Too Watered Down
",0.0,0.9878,2017-08-05 00:00:00,8,"This is a ""tale of tales"", and anyone expecting a Disney version of ""Fairy Tales"" with happy endings and glorious spectacles probably will not like this film. In the age of Game of Thrones, where we now know not to get too attached to characters we like or wishing they will all succeed, this tale of tales fits right along side of that type of narrative. The production is beautiful, the stories are unsettling, but they do have a moral.There are three stories, and what keeps you engrossed in the production are the locales, the acting, the music. Even though these are ""fairy tales"", they are more ""tales"" that we come to expect - not all whimsical and happy ever after - but to get the idea of what these characters want and why. Could I see Disney do these tales...? You bet, but it wouldn't be a ""human"" as seen here. Do the characters who long for their happy ever after make mistakes in their judgments? You bet. Do they pay? You bet. Would you do what they did? Of course not - you can see the problems coming a mile away! But that is not what a fairy tale is about, it is about telling the tale of those who could not. And in this case, a telling of the tales do not follow what we've come to expect, and the endings may not be as satisfying in a few of the stories for some, whereas I found them done well.Because of the production values of the time, it is set (medieval), you easily get swept up in the times of three ""Kingdom"" stories - A King (John C. Reilly) whose Queen (Salma Hayek) longed for a child more than anything, a King (Toby Jones) who loved his Princess daughter (Bebe Cave) but finds he loves a flea more, and a King (Vincent Cassel) who was a womanizing, sexually deviant cad obsessed with young, beautiful maidens of his kingdom and the sole drive of 'having to have them all'. And yes, in each there is a lesson of getting what you want, and what happens when you get it -- but not just that but who it ALSO effects around them. In other words, your wish -- is not just gonna be about...you.There is exposure to sex, violence, and rape in these tales so it is told for later teens and adults and not children. The production takes you from full fledged royal beauty to dark, dank and disgusting alleys, caves and streets of the time. I feel it is very enjoyable film to the eyes and a film to challenge your ideas on how different tales can be told. A solid 8 out of 10 for me."

I could not believe that some of these locations were not computer generated images. The cliffs at Alcantara, the castle at Roccascalegna, the throne room, the caves - all of them are real world locations. This is where they have far exceeded GoT and have greatly succeeded in creating a fantasy atmosphere to the film. Casting was another success. Again, I could not believe that some characters were not CGI or prosthetic. The necromancer, the ogre, the twins, were all real people. Imagine seeing a real world Shrek in the flesh, that is how I felt when seeing the ogre. Then the costumes, perfectly done to give to give a medieval setting, yet close to fantasy. Salma Hayek scene in the white dining room - pure class.The other element where they do better in in the pacing.

" Tale of Tales (2017)
",0.0,0.7369,2017-07-23 00:00:00,8,"Tale of Tales is an intriguing selection of interspersed narratives involving three separate kings of phantasmagorical kingdoms, inspired by the fairy tales of 17th century Italian poet Giambattista Basile. All of the tales are set in a beautifully lush, Gothic, faux medieval world. Where mythical creatures and magic exist around every hidden corner. Each tale is a metaphorical fable exploring the perils of obsession and its effects.The first king (King of Longtrellis) played by John C. Reilly is extremely obedient to his saturnine, morose Queen of Longtrellis played by the brooding Salma Hayak who desperately desires to mother children. The queen is approached by a mysteriously odd stranger who outlines a prophecy that a sea serpent will need to be sacrificed, the serpents heart cooked by a virgin and eaten by the Queen in order induce her pregnancy. King of Longtrellis dutifully obliges and grapples with the ginormous albino sea serpent in 17th century deep sea diving gear. After an underwater battle, reminiscent of early 20th century silent cinema such as Georges Melies, the king defeats the serpent to retrieve the prized heart but is gored and killed during scuffle. The grieving queen then devours the grotesquely large heart. The vibrant claret red a stark contrast to the pure white elaborate room. As a result of this, as prophesied, she falls pregnant. However, the Prince also has an albino twin mothered by the virgin servant maid exploited in the process. Several years later the Queen denies the Prince access to his pauper brother. The story changes direction when the brothers rebel the wishes of Queen of Longtrellis with dangerously unforeseen circumstances.The second King (King of Highills) played by Toby Jones, inhabits an enormous castle with his sweet but loquaciously opinionated daughter. The Princess truly desires to get married to escape the confines of the castle and explore the world. The distracted King intensely becomes obsessed with a flea – which he nurtures and allows to feed on on his royal blood in secret. After a long period of nurture and continued reclusiveness. The flea grows to an unnaturally large size, then subsequently dies causing great dismay to the King. The flea's giant epidermis or hide is then extracted. As the hide is unexplainably big for a flea and is far more likely to be a large calf it is used for what the King sees as an impossible task for his daughters potential suitors. The suitors are tasked with guessing the animal which the hide belongs to, if successful they will gain the Princesses hand in marriage. The Princess is delighted with the early suitors however all are unsuccessful until the grotesquely deformed ogre steps forward. He guesses correctly and to the great distress of the Princess she is taken on a dangerous journey away from the comfortable confines of the castle by the neanderthal esque captor, will she survive?The third King (King of Strongcliff) played by Vincent Cassell is a libertine of Casonova like proportions. He falls for soulful song and elegant voices of the mysterious sisters in the dank, boarded up clothe dye workhouse. He pursues one of the sisters, who invites his lustful advances but refuse to show their aged and scarred selves in fear of rejection. After much discussion behind a closed door, one of the sisters agrees to meet the King of Strongcliff in cover of night in his castle bed chambers. After a night of blind passion, the King is shocked to find the aged hag in his bed in the cold light of day. Under King's orders she is thrown from his castle tower balcony to her doom. A tree saves her fall, she is then given her restored youth from a passing forest witch in an unconventional manner Later in the story she draws the King towards her once more with her new found beauty. Her obsession damages her relationship with her adoring sister and puts them in further danger as her looks deteriorate as the story pans out.Tale of Tales is an exotic selection of dark fairy tales for adults, set in the idyllic Italian vista and dramatic coastline which only adds to the spectacle. The film is enjoyably unpredictable, brutal in places with protagonists being flayed, a murderous rampage, organ consumption and flamboyant debauchery. This is a dark film with black humour for fans of the dark fantasy Pan's Labyrinth, a sense of European epic adventure and spontaneity in the same vein as the likes of director Alejandro Jodorowsky. The film can be frustrating with the sometimes laboured pacing, some limited characters and a slightly disappointing conclusion after an entertaining journey. However, due to its surreal style, colourful characters, unpredictable tale story lines and its own brand of mythological fantasy, this is entertaining cinema."

It was a mega flub of storytelling, made me think the script writer had no idea where the convoluted plot line was going. For an instant I was wondering what the story was going to do with three monster-conceived albinos. I'm talking about the scene where Jonah *white hared doppelgänger of the prince* comes home and is surrounded by people while he's in a daze. ""How long was I gone?"" he asks. ""Five days."" Answers the mom. But the Prince and an injured Jonah are in the woods a few flashes of cinema later. How could any director, producer, editor miss that in the cutting room? The costumes are great, the scenery beautiful, camera work superb, music beautiful.

The three tales are so revealing about dominating social themes at the time they were written - the need for a male heir, the dangers of patriarchal eccentricity, the obsession with youth when forty was old - but they rise above their times and achieve universal relevance, and they are enriched with magic, monsters and the bizarre. The cinematography and music are wonderful and the locations gorgeous, especially Castel del Monte and Donnafugata. Making the movie was pure chutzpah, there is no way it would appeal to a mass audience. There is no closure, just the posing of questions about the meaning of what we have seen. Great stuff, and I wish other directors would have a go at such seductive material, though I fully understand why they don't!"
