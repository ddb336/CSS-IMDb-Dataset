" Sometimes films about life are as slow as real life
",0.0,0.9642,2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Not every film has to be fast with a hectic plot that rapidly unfolds leaving you on the edge of your seat at all times. Some films are at the same pace as life and if you don't like this second type of film, don't watch this movie.I can appreciate a slow film for what it is, and this one is definitely worth watching.I love Zach Braff as a director. His movies feel real, I think the characters are relatable, and I think he develops them well over the course of the story. He has also introduced me to some great music artists as I love the soundtrack too!"
" Two words
",0.0,-0.6801,2020-12-16 00:00:00,8,"Just wait. When you see that Kate Hudson is so far out of Zach's league he's incapable of SEEING Kate's league..just wait. When the kids get annoying..just wait. When Mandy Patinkin (the only man who could've pulled off this role) seems more trouble than he's worth..just wait. When the heavy jewish themes get even heavier...just wait.
The end is everything for this movie and it all builds towards that phenomenal ending."
" Zach Braff.... Amazing... Again.
",0.0,0.9977,2020-10-25 00:00:00,10,"I unapologetically love this movie. I've seen it around six times now and for some reason it just resonates with me. Zach Braff has always been someone I've enjoyed watching throughout his career. From his Scrubs days to directing the amazing Garden State. You'd see him pop on in random movies throughout the years but never anything quite memorable.I loved the way Braff directed this movie and through so much goddamn heart at you throughout. A lot of these characters aren't even that likable, but they all have good intentions. That's who people are, it's real. We all want to believe in our pursuit of happiness and our hopes and dreams and it can be one of the most challenging obstacles to achieve, but you should never give up on them.The cinematography is beautiful throughout. The desert scenes, the California ocean, and the way the camera glides throughout the movie is all done with such craft and care. Zach Braff is pretty much how he always is, but the dude is so talented with comedic and dramatic performances. I just loved the family dynamic and the message this movie had. It had nothing to do with the religious aspect, but it was handled in a way I liked.Overall, I've seen Wish I Was Here a bunch of times and I'll continue to appreciate what Zach Braff chose to do here. It didn't sit well with critics, but for some reason I just love this movie. Everyone has a few movies that critics didn't like but they really enjoy, this is my favorite one out of the bunch. I can't wait to see what Braff does next as his writing/directing project, I've loved the stories he's given us so far."
" ""Daddy's Love""
",0.6369,0.6711,2020-10-03 00:00:00,7,"Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.Big fan of Joey King (""The Act""), and Kate Hudson (""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days""), and even Zach Graff (""Scrubs"") and Josh Gad (""Frozen"") give a great performance.Unfortunately, while it has comedic elements, it's not a terribly funny movie. It's more like taking a serious situation and presenting it to someone in a very palatable, if obvious fashion.This is a ""life is hard"", mixed with ""tragic family event"" tropes with some nice multi-threading for sub plots.While it's a nice story of pushing through adversity, it's still a heavy story, a sad story, but (like in real life) it's about getting past the bad to grow the good."
" Loses its focus at times but should make you laugh and possibly shed a tear or two.
",0.6428,0.9565,2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,"Wish I Was Here starts off slower than it finishes and packs more punches towards the later half of the film. A semi-Indie film sort of in the same vein as Garden State (which is better) and was funded by way of Kickstarter; also written by brothers Adam and Zach Braff.
Zach Braff is ok, Kate Hudson is better and Josh Gad has my favorite scene in the movie with the best acting I've ever seen from him. Excellent music throughout."
" Touching and heartfelt
",0.5423,0.8402,2020-06-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie is less of a comedy and more of a heartfelt display of a man's journey through a transitioning period in his life.
It's beautiful and brings tears to my eyes on multiple occasions."
" A Cheap and Bad Aston Martini AD
",-0.5423,-0.5471,2020-04-28 00:00:00,1,"This is the first movie I have rated 1 star before even finishing it. The scenario is extremely basic and does not contribute you with any intellectualism. The director tries to win the hearts and minds by playing the ""emotions"" card, but even that does not save the day. Last but not least, the Aston Martini product placement was the most annoying product placement I have ever seen."
" Pretentious piece of crap
",-0.3818,-0.8384,2020-03-14 00:00:00,2,"It started off okay but descended into a mind boggling jumble of nonsense and narcissism. Does Zach Braff honestly believe he is that interesting? He's not. Does Kate Hudson believe that nipple shots and a bare midriff can replace acting ability? No, they can't. The movie is indulgent, boring and meaningless crap. I'll never watch another Zach Braff film if this is his standard. It goes a long way at explaining why 45 yr old Braff is dating a 24 yr old. He is not mature enough for women his own age."
" It felt refreshing...
",0.0,0.8674,2019-12-08 00:00:00,7,"The idea is behind a man in a part of his life where he is suppose to have a grip on everything but its the other way around. Its interesting seeing his journey and the family relations portrayed are beautiful.According to my rating strategy:
Story:1/2 (Good), Task Fulfillment:1/1, Acting: 2/2 (Close to reality), Directing, Cinematography and Soundtrack: 1.5/2 (Great Combination of the three), Wow Factor:0/1, Viewer: 1.5/2 (Worthed)"
" Self-indulgent Losers
",-0.5267,-0.636,2019-09-10 00:00:00,3,"This is apparently a movie about a bunch of self-indulgent losers pretending their first world problems are so insurmountable they are wiling to do almost anything to correct them - but work. An irritating character dressed in a space suit runs through the movie followed by a flying robot companion, for no discernible reason. Even the much vaunted hospital scene between Mandy Patinkin and Kate Hudson fell flat for me; they may as well have been speaking Greek. The only emotion this collection of superficial pathos invoked in me was an irresistible urge to kick the main character in the butt and say, ""Get a job!"""
" Wish I didn't watch this CRAP????
",0.5661,-0.9275,2019-09-04 00:00:00,1,"Ok allowing CHILDREN TO SWEAR IN A MOVIE AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE.
IS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE???
Then There Daughter SHAVES HER HEAD????
(Ok Big Deal, Then they Scream at Her)
How many GIRL'S AND BOY'S SHAVE THERE HEADS??? (And for what REASONS?)
In my OPION ALLOWING THE YOUNG CHILDREN TO SWEAR IN THIS MOVIE. IS HALF THE REASONS PART OF WRONG IN SCHOOLS, AND WITH PARENTS THESE DAY'S.
I am ONLY 47 YEARS OLD. We Hardly every SWORE IN FRONT OF OUR MOM, DAD, GRANDPARENTS, WHY BECAUSE IT WAS WRONG. IF WE SWORE AT SCHOOL WE GOT INTO TROUBLE.
THESE DAYS TEENAGERS, AND ALL SCHOOL KID'S GET AWAY WITH WAY TO MUCH.
BECAUSE OF MOVIES LIKE THIS.
HOW AGREES WITH ME????"
" Boring
",-0.3182,0.1306,2018-10-29 00:00:00,3,It wasn't horrible. It was just boring and unbelievable. How do they afford to live? Why are they together? So many unfunny moments. I have no idea why people watched this.
" Really Great!
",0.6893,0.9716,2018-09-02 00:00:00,10,"Real, raw, and emotional. A beautiful tribute to how messy our life can get when we're just trying to live, and how there is always a silver lining. Life is equal parts terrifying and lovely, but family is there to help you through it. Small acts of kindness can amount to wonderful successes, and life is worth everything."
" Something there is that doesn't love a wall
",-0.5216,-0.5719,2018-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Aiden Bloom (Zach Braff) is an out of work actor. His wife (Kate Hudson) supports the family with a job she pretends to like. Meanwhile Aiden's dad is dying from cancer. Finances are forcing their two kids to leave the private Orthodox school. Aiden also has an engineer brother who is an underachiever. He doesn't talk to dad.There are of course other issues. The film is a dramedy that deals with life, death, mending fences, and ideas about God. It is one of those heart warming films that I got deja vu watching. (I checked Amazon twice to see if I had already seen this film and written a review on it.) It is heavily theme driven. Would make for a decent family film once they deleted two scenes and bleeped out all the swearing.Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex. No nudity."
" Emotive, life-affirming, moving film about love and family
",0.6369,0.9797,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Wish I Was Here' is a very touching film. My best advice is don't go in expecting a hilarious comedy, but nor is it a dour/depressing drama. Braff is steadily becoming an accomplished director, knowing when to lighten the mood, but importantly, when to keep it real and meaningful. In fact, I probably liked 'Wish I Was Here' more than 'Garden State'...The film basically follows Aidan (Braff) and his family as they struggle to live their lives in Los Angeles - he's an out-of-work actor, wife Sarah (Hudson) is in a dull admin job, they can't afford to keep the kids in expensive Jewish school, his brother's an ambitionless drop-out, and to top it all off, his dad has lung cancer. Sounds bad? That's the basic premise - how does the human heart overcome such adversity?Once again, a fantastic soundtrack - featuring Bon Iver, The Shins & Paul Simon - with plenty of lovely moments, whether it's a sight gag (pamphlet container) or a simple explanation of something odd (the contact lenses). There's definitely some funny moments, mostly thanks to the youngest kid, Tucker (Gagnon, from 'Looper' & 'Extant') trying to understand what he's being told. Oh, and Turk from Scrubs turns up briefly! Sure, it gets a bit dramatic in parts and perhaps doesn't have the strongest ending.But, that being said, Grace (King), Gabe (Patinkin) & Noah (Gad) all have some scenes that seriously pull at the heart strings/tear ducts! The delicate moments are handled exceptionally and there's plenty of overt and concealed meanings in most of the scenes."
" Everyday emotional loop
",0.1531,-0.1154,2017-08-05 00:00:00,7,"Well, i guess if you are looking for a movie that is full of human emotions expressed with no words spoken that would be a good one to watch. It's a journey of self discovery through daily life struggles, though the movie is simple no plot twists, ambiguous hints or lines but it's the kinda of a daily story that might have happened to you or to someone you know. if you ain't looking for anything heavy, check this out."
" Unlikeable, unfunny characters
",0.0,-0.3951,2017-07-26 00:00:00,2,"I couldn't warm to this movie. The characters were too unlikable (apart from Bloom's wife). There are also a few anomalies in the plot. For example, the family at the center of the movie live in a comfortable, large house yet the husband is a struggling actor who has to rely on his dad to pay his kids school fees; while his wife works in what seems to be a mind-numbing, low-paid job. And as for unlikable characters, don't get me started on Noah! And then there's the confusing time-line. In the morning his dad is talking about going into hospital for specialist cancer treatment; then what seems like that afternoon, he's in hospital with only a short time to live. And you either like the humor or you don't - I didn't. I don't recommend it."
" Good message, but digested and overstated delivery with toilet humor
",0.5574,0.7558,2017-07-26 00:00:00,3,"The Message is great, relevant, but the delivery is quite crude, and frankly the jokes are too much toilet humor (for example, the guy is caught masturbating by his dad - what kind of subsequent interaction could be worth filming? It's unpleasant to watch esp. with younger relatives). As much as I welcome asking questions such as What are we doing in life? - the theme feels digested and overstated, whereas a higher quality delivery would attempt to induce the same epiphanies which in this film were stated as a matter of fact, leaving SOMETHING to the imagination. The focus on small fun (consumerist) ""dreams"" like driving an Aston Martin, though innocent, is ultimately shallow. Lastly, an example: wife tells husband that she is harassed at work, he talks like he will go and talk to that man, but she starts talking him out of it. I mean, I know people do that, but it's totally counterproductive, and it is not the only example. Bad taste."
" A rare gem
",0.0,0.9847,2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"Excellent cast. Beautifully shot. There are some classic lines in this under appreciated gem. I didn't catch it when it came out, but having experienced just about every moment in this film in my own life, I laughed and teared up and was moved to write this review. If you're old enough to have kids, have lost a parent or loved one or just appreciate the lunacy of Jash Gad, you'll appreciate this film. Patinkin, Hudson, Braff give the best work of their careers. Sometimes it doesn't matter if few see your work - it has the same effect on the universe. Thanks for making it."
" great film, terrific moments
",0.802,0.9259,2017-07-03 00:00:00,10,"This Film was great, I love the way Zach Braff performs and the way some scenes are produced! I loved especially the scene in the end where Katie jumps into the pool and the moment is stretched into 5 minutes. One gets so soaked into the moment and just when its over you remember that she jumped and probably felt this range of introspections."
" Human emotions
",0.0,0.9342,2017-05-15 00:00:00,10,"This is how a complete full packed movie should be. It has moments of joy, sorrow, relief & what not. And it shows how life takes turn. And how important the time is. You'll enjoy this movie, it's a heartfelt movie. Which makes you think & reconsider your priorities. It gives you broader aspect of viewing things. This movie has soul & so much to learn & feel. You shouldn't miss these one. And if you're film student pursuing Writing & Direction... You should definitely give it a try."
" A Pleasure to See Fandom and Jewish Culture in a movie
",0.5719,0.9979,2017-01-16 00:00:00,7,"When I saw a trailer for Wish I was Here on a DVD my husband and I watched last week I knew I wanted to see it. On our trip back to the library I was delighted to find Wish I we Here on their DVD shelves. I enjoyed the film tremendously. I grew up in Miami in a large Jewish community in the 1970s and 1980s. The story of the Bloom family- Aidan, Noah and their father- brought back a lot of memories for me. When they turned the pages of the family photo album I had to click pause on one picture, because it looked just like the pictures of my family at weddings and social events. Same colors, same hairdos, same fashions. The palm trees of LA reminded me of South Florida too. My relatives and the people I knew in school are not religious and feel like Aidan when it comes to religion: skeptical. I enjoyed the scenes of the religious school and the scenes with the rabbis. I appreciated that while Aidan didn't agree with his father about sending his children to a yeshiva the movie didn't criticize Grace's beliefs, the school, and the rabbis. I didn't mind the poking of the elderly rabbi: the sequence where he rides a segway in the hospital and crashes into a wall was hilarious. I'm glad that the movie didn't show Noah and Aidan rejecting their religious background in favour of being completely secular. Wish I Was Here could have just shown Aidan telling his children to forget about the yeshiva and religion and embrace ""normal"" contemporary life. I appreciated that Aidan found guidance from the younger rabbi, and Grace found ways to carry on her beliefs while adapting to their new lives after Aidan's father passed away. The pink wig was a nice symbol of her growing more confidence and openness to new experiences while maintaining her values: she was wearing a wig like a religious married woman, but it was bright pink. I'm a big fan of comics and I've been to the San Diego comic con a few times. It was great to see the convention in the movie and see the cosplayers walking outside the center and around the rooms, taking pleasure in showing off their costumes. Noah's space man costume was terrific. I saw a lot of amazing costumes at San Diego- I would have loved to see more cosplayers, especially the Star Wars costumes and the people dressing up as superheroes and supervillians. It's wonderful to see movies being made now that celebrate fan culture like the cosplayers and Comic Con. It's a pleasure to see a movie that presents growing up in a Jewish family, and explores aspects of Jewish identity, how adults and parents like Aidan and Noah feel about their heritage, and passing on values to their children."
