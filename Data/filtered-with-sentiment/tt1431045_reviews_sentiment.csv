" Fun Movie that broke all the rules
",0.128,0.8702,2021-03-21 00:00:00,6,"Deadpool is a fun movie, with touches of ridiculous comedy and action. While the story line isn't anything special it's definitely a fun watch. I liked Ryan Reynolds, he really made Deadpool and this was his most iconic movie ever."
" Can't believe the ratings...
",0.0,0.8176,2021-03-19 00:00:00,2,"I can't believe there are people giving this film a 10 out of 10. You're literally saying this is one of the best films you've ever watched...I mean if that's the case okay, but...well."
" Deadpool... Deadpool... Deadpool...
",0.0,0.9914,2021-03-18 00:00:00,10,THAT WAS AWESOME! The Movie Was Hilarious! It's Definitely One Of The Best Marvel Movies! I Mean It Was A Great Story With Great Characters And Great Humor! Definitely Check This Out If Have Not Seen Deadpool Yet! IT IS AWESOME!
" A mediocre plot made great by the excellent cast and humour
",0.8979,0.5267,2021-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Deadpool has a mediocre plot. But that really isn't the point of the movie. Deadpool is a comedy superhero movie, and it likes to mock itself. The humour is great, and the characters are exceptional especially Deadpool himself and the villain Francis/Ajax.However, sometimes the jokes can go too far or be badly placed and therefore can neglect any form of emotional impact that the scene could've brought."
" Funny and entertaining movie
",0.7003,0.911,2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"I did not read any of the comics, so I didn't know much coming into the theater. just went with my friends, and didn't regret going for sure. It was so fun and I have watched this 3 times!!"

",0.5696,0.8988,2021-03-09 00:00:00,9,"This is a welcomed breath of fresh air, not only to the getting stale superhero genre but to movies across the board.The movie feels like it was made while everybody's parents were away for the weekend and a bunch of naughty kids got hold of some cameras.So nice to see some cinematic risk taking. Proof movies don't have to be sanitised to make money!Awesome :)"
" Badass
",-0.1531,0.5423,2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,A badass movie thats all i can say.Deadpool is great
" The r-rated spiderman, who exceeded all expectations
",0.0,0.9943,2021-03-04 00:00:00,9,"Deadpool is a controversial character with many X-Men-fans hating him, because of his rivalry with Logan and a lot of critics first thinking that the humor ad violence in the trailer scenes seems artificial.
But with its release the movie, which had arguably one of the biggest impacts in 2016, has proven, that with the right actor, who was undoubtedly Ryan Renolds, you can keep up the action, while creating a unique atmosphere through the constant black humor and satire.
The movie is making fun of other movies as much as of itself with its 4th-wall-breaking, while Ryan manages not only to play Deadpool but to define Deadpool.
The film starts with an action scene grasping the viewer tightly from the beginning. The action scene is like the others equipped with insane-looking filmmaking techniques. From there on the movie continues with its unique time-jumps to then explain the beginning of the story in which Ryan manages to build one of the best love stories in superhero films for years on the way with the help of Morena Baccarin as Vanessa. Thus creating a deep emotional ground for the viewer to watch the following drama grow.
In these scenes, the villain ""Francis"" as Deadpool would call him, is introduced. The following plot is rather basic, but what many don't realize is that the movie isn't trying to have a unique plot because Deadpool tries to follow these cliches so that it can make fun of them.
Also, the humor, that many feared to be artificial, has a very different effect, when experienced in the movie in contrast to as it looks like in the trailer, because the trailer isn't showing how these situations came to be, which is always done in a very natural way, justifying it perfectly.
To conclude you can say, that the movie has amazing production techniques, acting, and pacing. Although many think, that it was the best film of the year, there are people, who don't get the charm of the film.
If you are interested in this kind of humor and satire you should watch it because the chances of you getting the charm of the movie should be high then."
" Wittiest character I ever encountered
",0.0,0.9884,2021-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Superhero movies to me are usually a little boring. They all have more or less a similar plot just different super powers.
Deadpool is the parody of superheroes but he's the funniest and wittiest of all.
This is one of the few movies that can keep me away from my phone. It's so entertaining and the filming methods are fantastic. All the slow motion parts and the zoom. Simply incredible.
Great acting. Great music. One of my all time favorite movies."
" WAY too violent
",-0.5994,0.0,2021-03-02 00:00:00,2,Turned it off after 20 minutes. Give me The Avengers anyday.
" You can't not love this film
",0.4122,0.2481,2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,Deadpool is such an iconic character. Ryan Reynolds is basically Deadpool. He's a sarcastic piece of work who is just hilarious!
" Funny, bloody and entertaining superhero movie.
",0.4404,0.9698,2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Deadpool is the new superhero movie starring Ryan Reynolds. Well, it's not new anymore. The movie came out 5 years ago, and I didn't see the movie because I didn't expect it to be good. Do you remember Green Lantern? Yep, that's why!I watched the movie because my brother forced me. I agreed on the terms, and it was more fun than I'd really expected. I've already watched the movie 3 times, and watched the sequel even more times. I actually likes the sequel a little bit more. There's several reasons why. It's a little bit funnier, arguably more violent, and not as vulgar as the first one. This movie is also hilariously violent and funny. This is one of the funniest superhero movies I've seen, and should be watched by every adult superhero fan.Ryan Reynolds is perfect as Deadpool. He does the movie a complete comedy, and breaks the 4th wall several times. He even jokes about it. He even jokes about himself. There's references to Green Lantern, Wolverine, X-Men, Professor X, and Ryan Reynolds. It makes everything so fun to watch. Even Ed Skrein is perfection as Ajax, the british supervillain who ruined Wade's life.I know I've sad that Deadpool 2's better, but one thing this movie does better, is the storytelling. It begins in a violent action scene where Deadpool kills a bunch of men. And so, it jumps back two years before this, and tells his happy life until he gets cancer and takes the opportunity to get a cure. Well, it ruined his life.This is with no doubt a highly recommended superhero movie if you want to have some fun. Well, this movie gives you an overload of fun. The only bad thing in this movie is that there is some serious and emotional scenes in the movie, as well. It completely blocks some of the dark humour that ends the scene. These scenes didn't have to be in this movie, or at least they could have made it shorter. Another bad thing in the movie is that it has some moments where you just want to see action without humour. But there is humour in every action scene. You may don't want to laugh, but you do it anyway. That's kinda irritating. Besides from that, almost everything that's meant to be funny is funny. You should definitely give this movie (and the sequel) a chance."
" Not For Me
",0.0,0.8482,2021-02-28 00:00:00,3,"I like the idea of Deadpool, but about the only thing I can positively say about this movie is that it has its funny moments. Aside from that, it does not showcase a person worth 'looking up to' - even by anti-hero standards."
" Perfectly made
",0.6369,0.8514,2021-02-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie has a perfect portrayal of how Deadpool is supposed to be. It has action, love, and tons of comedy, which is everything a Deadpool movie should have. Couldn't ask for a better Deadpool movie!"
" Ryan Reynolds brought a comic accurate Deadpool and the film is a masterpiece in the superhero genre
",0.6249,0.9986,2021-02-14 00:00:00,10,"It took a long time for 20th Century Fox to have Deadpool appear in their X-Men Universe, the character's first appearance in love action was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and it wasn't the Deadpool many fans wanted. But the beloved anti-hero, Deadpool is back and stays true to his comic book counterpart. Huge thanks to Simon Kinberg, Ryan Reynolds and Lauren Shuler Donner who served as producers for the movie, and what they have given us is something incredible... Something amazing and memorable for years to come, it have grown to be one of my favorite action/comedy movies of all time. The adult humor is wonderful, it's funny and at times really raunchy but it works, it's Deadpool after all.Deadpool is directed by Tim Miller from a screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. It was his directional debut and he did an excellent job, I don't really have anything negative to say but it isn't anything mind blowing. The writing for the dialogue, jokes and characters are great. The plot isn't very original but it works fine, you will be entertained from start to finish and they succeeded with that.
It stars Ryan Reynolds in the title role alongside Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, and Brianna Hildebrand. Everyone did a great job with both the action sequences and the dramatic parts, but Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool is breathtaking because he is Deadpool, no one could do it better than him. It's his passion project and you see how passionate he is in the performance, good job Ryan.For a superhero movie, the film received many awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice Awards and two Golden Globe nominations. It shows how good the movie is and I would say it is a masterpiece in its genre. They got so many things right and almost none wrong, the choice of music is on point and so was the jokes that were told, the improvisation.
I've watched Deadpool three times now and I will continue that route, re-watching it an endless amount of times. I like it a lot."
" Don't like it, you dumbest
",-0.6608,0.0516,2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,Damn good film that takes a viewer through all emotions as a film should.
" High Marks Just Because He Swears Randomly
",0.0516,-0.469,2021-02-09 00:00:00,1,Lot's of people I know rave about this film... I found it pointless and just seemed like they made it so they have a character that swears and tries to be funny. It just seemed really forced. The worst film I've ever watched (maybe)
" Junk movie
",0.0,-0.7184,2021-02-06 00:00:00,1,"Can't believe people watch this, unoriginal, stupid, lots of unnecessary violence for some reason, unnecessary sex. Just like all other junk movies."
" Great

Ryan renolds was great in it

Over all great"
" Total and utter garbage
",0.0,0.9403,2021-02-01 00:00:00,1,"This must surely be the most over hyped load of cow dung produced in recent times. Could be described as schoolboy humour but that would insult the average primary school kid. You know a script is devoid of real substance when 'strong language' replaces every third word and the only laugh you will get is from our pre-superhero actor trying to look sincere in the 'moving' sequences. For films like this IMDB should invent a zero rating, one star is too many."
" Good Job
",0.4404,0.9186,2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Actually, it's an interesting idea. Humor doesn't seem to be irrelevant. The main character is shown beautifully, the actors have done their job. This film clearly stands out from a bunch of other Marvel projects."

" BEST MOVIE EVER!!!
",0.7249,0.9812,2021-01-06 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. I have been obsessed with Deadpool even before I watched the movie. It has action, violence, comedy, adventure, marvel, romance, and Ryan Reynolds, what more can you ask for! Deadpool has an amazing storyline, acting, and cast. Deadpool is my favorite Marvel character by far and Ryan Reynolds is meant for Deadpool no one else could play Deadpool as good as him. The villain Ajax is a pretty good villain and the actor who plays him Ed Skrein plays him really well. With Deadpool now joining the MCU there is a lot more things Marvel can explore/do with the character."
" Deadpool: My favourite movie!!!!!!!
",0.0,0.9764,2020-12-28 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. The comedy aspect of it. This is the first X-Men movie to not take itself so seriously. In fact, it is the opposite of serious. Ryan Reynolds ACED the role as Deadpool. And trust me, I know. I am a HUGE Deadpool fan.
I really recommend watching this movie (if you are allowed, because the sexual humour, swearing, violence/gore, nudity may be too much for viewers under the age of 12).
Honestly though, GREAT movie."
" That superhero is seriously sexy and awesome
",0.7783,0.9957,2020-12-23 00:00:00,10,"I love the movie but I saw it in cinemas. It's got cheesy lines, great action and I love the character deadpool because he's really cute and funny but he's like spider-man with swords. I love the casts like Ryan Reynolds, T.J. Miller and Taylor Hickson because they're good actors. It's the movie for everyone except kids. I love this one. I love the sequel because it's greater.
I give it 10/10"
" Hilarious Yet Adventuress
",0.5423,0.9042,2020-12-05 00:00:00,10,"The Merc with the Mouth being introduced as someone who gets paid to track and kill people we see the story gives explaination that he has a slight soft spot for kindness on occasion, the story also brings the love interest, tradgedy and revenge in one sitting and quite a bit of hilariousness.Ryan Reynolds certainly becomes this character and doesn't hold back. This is one of the few storylines of an anti super hero fans of the comic could enjoy.Plenty of action, plenty of comedy and a dose of awsome."
" Laudable filmmaking, Razzie-worthy writing
",0.0,0.7704,2020-12-01 00:00:00,3,"It appears that a 12 year old wrote a movie and gave it to his dad to sex up and spend $58 million on. The filmmaking and visual effects were extraordinary, but the script was absolutely atrocious, save 6-7 one-liners. Between the lazy dialogue and the poorly dubbed metal guy who was-- wait for it-- Eastern European, it's amazing that anyone could read through this film even once, let alone green light it to be made. Seriously though, did our aforementioned 12 year old let his 8 year old sister write the chrome-plated Russian guy's lines? And did he hand it off to his 70 year old grandfather to write lava girl's lines? The dialogue was so bad that I actually wrote a review for this movie 4 years after it was made, in spite of the fact that it has an 8.0 here in IMDB. It gives The Room a run for its money. The special effects and cinematography were really good though, so this gets a rock solid 3.
TL;DR: Laudable filmmaking, Razzie-worthy writing"
" Hilarious!
",0.4574,-0.0064,2020-11-30 00:00:00,9,"At the begining I hated this movie because because I'm not fan of the superheroes, but when I saw it, I liked it so much.
The humor is very well done, especially in the ""Where's Francis?"" scene.
The Wade's experiments are terrific and very crude, I liked it, because the movie knows how Be serious in that moments.I liked Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage the longest name of the World.The violence is incredible, you really hesitate of you're watching a movie with Marvel's origins.Anyway, I liked the Francis' death too. Very funny.9/10"
" Hilarious 😂
",0.4019,0.7821,2020-11-29 00:00:00,10,"First of all this isn't your average superhero film so don't expect the ""oh we need to save the world"" type films
Nope this is a revenge story and it is really funny. You see, Deadpool isn't a superhero but he isn't even close to a villain.
One of the best fox X-men movies everGO SEE IT!!!"
" Superhero seeks revenge
",-0.5267,0.6059,2020-11-19 00:00:00,6,"Wade Wilson, ex special forces and working as a mercenary, has terminal cancer. He accepts an experimental cure which gives him superhuman healing powers but leaves him disfigured. When his girlfriend is killed, he seeks revenge.Violent but funny superhero action film which works because of the performance by Ryan Reynolds as the wisecracking and profane title character. The humour, dialogue and language are undoubtedly aimed at adults and fans of the genre will enjoy this."
" Fresh!
",0.3802,0.8356,2020-11-18 00:00:00,9,Loved this fresh take on a somewhat stale genre. Ryan Reynolds was born to play this part!

",0.7425,0.8192,2020-11-12 00:00:00,10,"I tried so hard not to laugh at some times, as I was watching in the middle of the night with my brother. This movie is too funny, and so is the second one. It's kind of inappropriate, but HILARIOUS at the same time. If you're watching with a younger audience, make sure you skip the inappropriate parts!"
" The role Ryan Reynolds was born to play
",0.34,0.9716,2020-10-20 00:00:00,8,"It is hard to believe that anyone besides Ryan Reynolds could make Deadpool as successful as it was.This film is a great superhero origin story, a master class in breaking the fourth wall and an excellent example of how to make an R rated movie that is accessible to the masses.Despite a relatively small budget, this film looks great, is smartly written and includes a great ensemble cast."

" Definitely Not Suited for a General Audience
",0.4019,-0.8536,2020-09-24 00:00:00,7,"This film essentially begins with a mercenary by the name of ""Wade Wilson"" (Ryan Reynolds) learning that he has contracted an incurable form cancer and only has a short time to live. Needless to say, his new fiancé ""Vanessa"" (Morena Baccarin) is devastated and rather than having her endure the agony of watching him die he decides to leave without telling her. Strangely enough, upon his departure he is approached by a mysterious man who offers him an experimental cure in exchange for his complete cooperation with his superiors immediately afterward. He agrees and is then injected with a serum and subsequently subjected to a multitude of extremely painful procedures at the direction of a sadistic psychopath named ""Ajax"" (Ed Skrein ). Incredibly enough, the serum not only works but he is transformed into an almost indestructible being in the process. Unfortunately, that same procedure has also left him horribly disfigured as well and for that reason he assumes the new secret identity of ""Dead Pool"" and makes it his mission to kill Ajax and destroy his clandestine criminal organization at all costs. Now rather than revealing any more I will just say that I knew going in that this was a graphic film which contained vulgar language and scenes of a sexual nature. So I wasn't too surprised. What was surprising, however, was how likeable and funny such a foul-mouthed lout turned out to be overall with his best friend ""Weasel"" (T.J. Miller) being particularly humorous. At any rate, I enjoyed this film for the most part and have rated it accordingly. Above average."
" Deadpool Review
",0.0,0.8792,2020-09-23 00:00:00,8,"It doesn't matter what comics or inspiration this movie was based, the anti-hero Deadpool is more than that because of his awareness that he is a comic book character. The important thing in this movie is the persona of Deadpool in its own right, and in this movie Ryan Reynolds was capable of perceiving it and acting it almost to perfection."

",0.5574,0.9457,2020-09-11 00:00:00,9,"Deadpool is an amazing clash of a comedy and superhero origin story which clashes incredibly funny. If you are under 15 then I do think you shall wait because of the violence, sex language and even more violence. In my case it was these factors that made me love this film. For my case in watching this film I did find it a tiny bit underwhelming but it didn't strafe to far from my expectations.There wasn't anything bad actually in the movie its just that some of the jokes did feel a bit underwhelming. The fight sequences where good and probably the best part of the movie."

I can't think of any other actor who could possibly have played the role of a snarky and hilarious version of Deadpool any better than Van Wilder himself (Ryan Reynolds). The casting was absolutely perfect for this 18+ rated version of Deadpool that they invented. They could have chosen to do a more somber and darker portrayal of the Deadpool character, but instead opted to make him a snarky as$hole with a penchant for toilet humor and public nudity (which is great). Too many of these superhero movies are 'teen rated' so that they can break box-office records, but Deadpool's director just didn't care, and it STILL did fantastically at the box-office, despite being 18+ rated.Overall, the movie does everything fantastically with a great balance between humor and action and the only thing that it could really have done to earn a better score would have been to be longer than 2hours and to have more CGI with more featured superheroes. If it ticked all 3 of those boxes, then this could possibly have been a 10/10 movie, though 8/10 is still great."
" A movie about a foul mouthed hero who throws 4th wall jokes

Ryan Reynolds was great as the title charcther as he always plays sarcastic guys with alot of sarcasm. If you are looking for a family friendly superhero flick then this isn't for you but if you love crude jokes,bad language throughout and alot of decapatating and gory thrown in sex jokes then you'll probably love it. For me I wasn't a fan as I'm more of a Spiderman/X-Men/Batman fan.Was gonna add The Mask in here too as the actual comics were like Deadpool as both charcthers are Canadian and both break the 4th wall jokes only in the comics they are really gruesome but The Mask was toned down in the movie version."

Deadpool is an origin story on the character. It follows his origins and subsequent revenge on the group that wronged him. Along the way, a pair of X-Men try to redeem Deadpool.Deadpool retains its comic book charm and violence in this live-action adaptation. The movie has Deadpool constantly making jokes even when the subject manner gets darker. The movie makes light of many dark situations such as horrendous disfiguring that brings the movie back into a lighter tone. Since this movie is an origin story, much of Deadpool's backstory is told here. However, his story is not fully complete as the X-Men acquaintances, the Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead are not explained fully. The plot is incredibly basic as it is a simple revenge story that is told through flashbacks.Even with its basic plot, the story has some highlights in the way it is paced. With humor, and wit the story remains engaging. The true highlights in the movie are its action sequences. The action in this movie is well shot and well performed. The effects and sets are well detailed. It is easy to watch the movie solely for its action scenes to fill the price of admission.It is easy to recommend Deadpool to anyone looking for witty dialogue and entertaining action. Anyone looking for a movie to transcend the typical superhero movie plots should look elsewhere.Grade: B"

" Deadpool
",0.0,0.9974,2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,"If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!"

" Enjoyable Experience
",0.4404,0.997,2020-05-17 00:00:00,6,"Deadpool is a unique nut ultimately flawed movie. It's a nice middle finger to the standard superhero genre, but, other than that, it does not have much substance.Don't get me wrong. I like the jokes. I like the gore and the meta humor. But I also want an engaging story. The whole film is your run of the mill, average story with some engaging sequences. The effects haven't aged well, but that's excusable with the budget it has. The side characters and the opening title sequence are pretty subversive, and so is the end credits scene.But if the only thing holding up the movie is the comedy and the R rating, then that's not enough. This film tries to make fun of superhero tropes and use them as well. You can't have keep your cake but also try to eat it. Either be a generic film or be a complete subversion of the genre.The first action sequence at the beginning is by far the best one. In fact, every action sequence after it is kind of a letdown comparatively. The villain was pretty weak, but serviceable.I don't hate this movie, I just feel like it's wasted potential. They could have done a lot more than this. I am still glad that this movie made a lot of money, and I'm glad it had a large impact. I hope that, as time goes on, we get more super-hero movies that are rated R and try something that hasn't been done before. I hope more studios will be confident enough to give filmmakers more freedom to tell unique stories. At the end of the day, I'm more glad of the impact this film had rather than the film itself"

" Reynolds, the writers, and newcomer director Tim Miller (or ""some very well paid director,"" as the opening credits claim) all jump into what the character really has to offer.
",0.5984,0.9983,2020-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Deadpool is one of those characters that are hard to work with, because you must embrace its real essence and explore its full potential. Already previously portrayed on movie screens in ""X-Men Origns- Wolverine"" and also being played by Ryan Reynolds, but in a totally misrepresented way, as a poorly made caricature of what this character really is, causing enormous frustration to fans of X-Men. Wilson is one of the members of Team X of William Stryker (along with Wolverine, Sabretooth, Bolt, John Wraith, Agent Zero and Blob). After his ""death"", Wilson's body is ""harnessed"" in the Arma X project and becomes ""Weapon XI"" (played by Reynolds and Scott Adkins), referred to by Stryker as ""Deadpool"" for having ""plundered"" powers (pooled ) from other mutants - the healing factor and blades coming out of the fists like Wolverine's, Scott Summers' optical bursts and Wraith's teleportation.A few years later, Fox, aware of the potential at hand, decided to give the character a new opportunity and called Reynolds again to play him. The actor wanted to do it right this time. For the direction, Tim Miller, specialist in visual effects for cinema and video games, was called to lead the chatty anti-hero's first solo adventure. This version of Deadpool ignores the version of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, although its metalinguistic and debauched tone includes derogatory mentions to it.The character was created by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza and appeared for the first time in 1991, as a villain in New Mutants # 98 (a story that in Brazil came out in Os Fabulosos X-Men # 584 in 1994). It was inspired by the villain of DC Comics Exterminador (Deathstroke), including with his name parodying his alter ego, ""Slade Wilson"". From a title written by Joe Kelly and Ed McGuinness in 1998, he gained his own style, known for its destructive capacity, extremely acid humor, cultural satirical references and occasionally the breaking of the fourth wall, communicating directly with the reader.The great success of this adaptation is undoubtedly the script of the duo Rhet Reese and Paul Wernick, able to explain the whole essence of the character with a text full of pop references, metalanguages and self-references in a mocking tone, betting on an acid and nothing politically correct. In no way does this sucker remind us of the low-age texts from the Marvel universe and his most innocent humor delicately inserted. ""Deadpool"" makes everything even more funny, daring, uses and abuses sexual swear words without any ceremony, without censorship in an unforgivable joke that does not leave out even Hugh Jackman, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart and James McAvow, the singer Sinead O'Connor, Green Lantern, A Place Called Notting Hill and even Ryan Reynolds himself.Presented as ""another superhero movie"" with ""a hot girl"", ""a CGI character"" and ""a British villain"", Deadpool assumes the most fanciful principle possible when he decides to transform Wade Wilson (Reynolds), a former Special Forces officer, a kind of upside-down hero (or anti-hero, as you prefer) who decides to go after those responsible for his deformed skin after Wade agreed to participate in experiments due to the appearance of terminal cancer. Reynolds, the writers, and newcomer director Tim Miller (or ""some very well paid director,"" as the opening credits claim) all jump into what the character really has to offer. It is not easy to take a movie all over the mood that needs to burst out laughing at every scene, and Deadpool does it.And it's not just humor that Deadpool's greatest merits lie. Director Tim Miller and the neat edition of Julian Clarke construct action scenes in an ingenious way, dynamically, based on the absence of linearity - a feature that does the job of instigating the audience's interest. They bring a difference compared to other films of the genre. The still scenes spinning around its axis, the mind-blowing action scenes extremely well choreographed and drawn that culminate in a bridge, in the middle of bodies being launched and being cut and torn in slow motion. It is unusual graphic violence for the genre. Due to the low budget for a film of the genre, the film merges in editing only two large action scenes, which opens and closes the film. The scenes of the chase through the streets and the shooting on the bridge are millimetrically planned, whereas the scenes at the climax of the film are interesting, but more generic and standardized.Just as Hgh Jackman was born to play Wolverine, Ryan Reynolds is the perfect embodiment of Deadpool. Also collaborating with ideas for the script, the actor dedicated himself to this second opportunity to live the anti-hero and brings all the sarcasm and acidity needed. His chemistry with the sensual Brazilian actress Morena Baccarin - who plays the prostitute Vanessa - stands out and yields great scenes of complicity between them. They are two people with different personal traumas who meet and get involved in body and soul.Completing the cast, the villain Ed Skrein (Ajax) and the comic relief, the Indian Dopinder (Karan Soni) also serve his purposes very well. Master Stan Lee is also present, making yet another hilarious participation. But not everything works so well. However, given the freshness and vitality of the mercenary, the rest of the characters are erased, stereotyped and even wasted when the script under-utilizes their skills, especially the fantastic Gina Carano, former MMA fighter.The mutant Colossus, who brings a actor Stefan Kapicic's heavy and heavy accent - which at times irritates.""Deadpool"" brings a freshness to the genre and manages to perfectly balance the rampant violence with the inconsequential humor and effectively presents us with a character previously unknown among the biggest names in the current cinema of heroes. He is charismatic, he is irreverent, he is talkative, he is cynical and he is really amusing. This is Deadpool."

" A Pool of Fun... But Not Too Deep of an Experience
",0.0,0.9729,2020-03-12 00:00:00,8,"2016's ""Deadpool"" is comedically brazen and brutally gory. It's certainly fun and thrilling, but it's puerile of those things rather than being a movie of deeper meaningfulness.As an avid comics fan, Deadpool has never been a character that has gravitated me in comparison to far superior others. To me, there's not much enduring depth to him beyond his quips, juvenile and profane humour, and ostentatious behaviour. He's a character to appeal to the easily amused. The personification of jingling keys for a baby's attention.Deadpool was hatched from the '90s egg when the comics industry trend had an influx of characters with superfluous costume design elements (excessive pouches a prime example), their bodies soaked with weapons, and contrived sounding and spelt names for forced edginess. It wasn't the tendency of the entire comics published of the era, there were quality exceptions for sure, but those superfluous elements were definitely the popular saddle riding trend at the time, defined the decade, and it was a damaging contributor among other factors to the then market collapse of the comics industry (Marvel had eventually declared bankruptcy). I digress, but Deadpool came from that same vapid mould.To conclude this, I'm not fond of Deadpool as a character, but I don't want the assumption that 2016's ""Deadpool"" isn't entertainingly worthwhile for what it is. Because it certainly is. I gave it an 8/10. I just don't feel there's anything meaningful beyond a character who's seemingly only purpose is getting cheap laughs. But hey, to each their own opinion; I'm just expressing mine.* Just as a bonus thought, of further detriment to the movie, due to the silly nature of the character, any emotional weight or tension of a scene that is intended to stir things like empathy, suspense, or sadness within the audience is nearly squashed entirely; if Deadpool continually strives for laughs and mockery of it - doesn't take those things seriously - why should the audience?"

It also does a great job fleshing out Wade Wilson's character, instead of making him a service-level comedian; they showed us his prior life and love life, and it was executed very well.

",0.5827,0.9985,2020-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Deadpool does not sound like your typical superhero who saves the day every time, which is completely true. Wade Wilson was a completely normal man who had found love until one day he was diagnosed with cancer that would only give him a few more months. Wade was determined to find a way to live through it and that's when he met a scientist who said he could cure him. Instead of being cured the scientist turned him into this ugly superhero who could grow back any part of his body. He needed to find the man who did this to him and make him undo it all so he could face the love of his life once again. Follow Deadpool on his crazy adventure for revenge to get back his girlfriend back. Deadpool is a phenomenal movie written by Rhett Reese and beautifully directed by Tim Miller, starring some of Hollywood's best actors like Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, TJ Miller, and Ed Skrein.
Deadpool's cheesy soundtrack and over the top soliloquies contribute to the film and gives it the character that Tim Miller created a hilarious, insane, main character played by Ryan Reynolds who fit the role perfectly. The chemistry between Reynold and Baccarin is so believable and the hate towards Deadpool's enemy Ajax played by Ed Skrein is shown so well through Deadpool's humor. The movies one hour and forty-nine minute run time is just enough and you stay entertained the whole entire time.
Watching Deadpool pine for Vanessa while she thinks he's dead really gets you on the edge of your seat! Seeing Deadpool that sad over her for so long makes you just want to say to him come on go get her! But he needed to wait until he got his face back which was a bit unfortunate to see. But the moment when they finally get used together again is all worth the wait!
Deadpool for sure has to be one of the most entertaining and hilarious superhero movies of all time! If I got to choose which superhero movie to watch I would definitely choose Deadpool it has humor, action, and romance all in one for everybody to enjoy!
Ryan Reynolds humor and enthusiasm ties the whole movie together to make a brilliant piece of art made for many teens and adults to appreciate. He was the perfect pick for this role. His personality on the screen is humorous and dirty which fits perfectly with the films dynamic.
The actors in Deadpool made this movie so much fun to watch and you can't stop laughing throughout the whole movie! Deadpool's crazy humor and depression keep the movie very dark but still so funny. Tim Millers directing was perfect and each and every scene made sense. Deadpool tied together so many different types of movies action, romance, and comedy which made the movie enjoyable for almost everyone! My only wish is that Deadpool had been longer, but luckily there is a second movie for everyone to enjoy!"
" When film makers take the proper risks, they get big rewards. This movie is a perfect example of that!
",0.7177,0.9991,2020-01-17 00:00:00,10,"""Deadpool"" (2016), this movie is a superhero film marvel (no pun intended). But, to be honest, when it first came out I wasn't interested in seeing it. Then one day, when I had some free time, I went to see it and I'm stoked that I did! This movie has found a place on my top 10 all-time favorite superhero films list. Not only that, but it is, without a doubt, the funniest superhero film ever made. It has a perfect story, terrific acting, first-rate special effects, perfect sets/locations, and a great soundtrack. The plot line is one of the most creative superhero origin stories in recent years. It has a perfect balance of action, comedy, and drama. Every joke and one-liner hits bullseye, there are even fourth wall jokes that are hysterical! As far as the acting goes, every one of them hits it out of the park, especially Ryan Reynolds. Here's an interesting bit of history for you all. This isn't the first time that Ryan Reynolds has portrayed Deadpool. He played the character in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009). But just like that ""movie"" and the majority of the rest of the ""X-Men"" movies, they got the Deadpool character all wrong. It's very easy to see why the portrayal of Deadpool was wrong in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", you can look it up and see for yourself. Ryan Reynolds convinced the studio to let him play the character again, and this time do it right. That they did! The current version of Deadpool is 100% faithful to the character and the comics, and Ryan Reynolds is pitch-perfect in the role! He made the right move leaving DC and coming to Marvel, and he even makes fun of the horrible movie ""Green Lantern"" (2011). I loved that! The rest of the actors are excellent as well, but the only one I have some mixed feelings with is T.J. Miller as Weasel. Now, just hear me out, his performance in no way hurts the movie or any of the other acting performances. But T.J.'s portrayal of Weasel is just so deadpan, where it is almost borderline dull! His facial expression hardly changes, and the sound of his dialogue doesn't help much either. However, if the character Weasel in the comics has a dry personality, then his performance was spot on. It kind of gives me the same feelings just like Julie Hagerty's questionable performance in the movie ""Airplane!"" (1980). I don't know, I'm just up in the air about T.J. Miller's acting in this movie. Now don't get me wrong, I love deadpan and dry humor done right. When done properly, it's hilarious! But, I think that T.J. could have done a little better though. At the end of the day, I still consider his performance to be passable. As far as special effects go, they are first-rate. Being made in 2016, that is not surprising The sets/locations really set the tone for the movie and help bring it to life. Finally, the soundtrack is well composed. Tom Holkenborg, a.k.a. Junkie XL, made modern music work for this movie and it helps tie the film together. There are a lot of songs in the soundtrack that I enjoy, and the music is utilized perfectly to set the tone for the story. This film is a superhero movie done right. The whole movie is over the top from start to finish. Usually, over the top elements are hit and miss in movies and shows, but when used at the right time, it really adds a whole new depth of entertainment to the film! Director Tim Miller, you did a fantastic job with this movie! I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 stars. If you haven't seen ""Deadpool"" yet, go watch it today, I guarantee you'll love it. But if you don't see it, Deadpool will hunt you down!"
" Deadpool review
",0.0,0.9321,2020-01-14 00:00:00,7,"So Deadpool.
This movie is alright. The story, when you think about it, is very simple. There is a bad guy and then there is anti-hero Deadpool. There is also a fun friend, a girlfriend and two sidekicks. All very original.Deadpool probably knew that the story wasn't gonna be the draw for this movie. So they focused on other things. The movie has a R rating, so obviously there is plenty of fun violence in it. Many of the action scenes are therefore very fun to watch.The character Deadpool is without a doubt the most memorable part of this movie. The casting of Ryan Reynolds was a very good pick. I enjoyed pretty much every scene including Deadpool. So yeah, i enjoyed pretty much every scene. Though the start is just kinda fine.Honestly not all the joked landed that well, but Ryan's performance made up for most of it. The villain was extremely forgettable, as was the story.
So all in all this movie is very fun, but overrated."
" Never thought that a superhero movie could be so entertaining
",0.5777,0.512,2020-01-08 00:00:00,8,"""Deadpool"" is really different than the usual Marvel movie. After watching the all the 23 movies of the Infinity Saga, I think that in the end they were more or less all with the same narrative structure, except from Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 1 and 2, that were slightly different and had unusual and funny characters.Deadpool is different, he is not the classic good superhero that saves the world from a supervillain that wants to conquest the entire galaxy, he is nor a bad or a good guy and his fight against evil is personal. He doesn't need to fight for humanity, he is a crazy antihero that just wants to live a normal life (more or less). Ryan Reynolds was the perfect pick, he is funny and refreshing. He breaks the 4th wall several times during different scenes. A smart move from the director to keep the audience captured for the whole movie.I never thought that I could give 8 stars out of 10 to a superhero movie, but this one for me, is really worth to be watched."

" A welcoming addition to the superhero genre
",0.4404,-0.7856,2019-12-26 00:00:00,8,"""Deadpool"" is a superhero movie. It has the well recognizable formula we've seen in the MCU movies. But it does everything with a twist. When Ryan Reynolds plays the Merc with the Mouth, he does so with exemplary comedic timing and lifts this movie, making it truly stand out from the superhero concept we are all so familiar with. There are many highs and few lows in this film; it's hard not to love the interaction between Deadpool and his blind house lord Blind Al (Uggams), and the introduction of Colossus and the sarcastic Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Hildebrand) is another high. The fourth wall breaking and self-awareness of ""Deadpool"" is another huge plus and weights up well to the negative aspects. The downsides of this comedy Marvel flick is most prominently the lack of a credible supervillain. While Ed Skrein does the most with the role of Ajax, he never really becomes a credible threat. The comedy infused with the most climatic scene adds a bit to this but mostly, I would say, the lack of something at stake at the end - or feel of it - is due to the writing. Nevertheless, ""Deadpool"" is one of the most memorable superhero movies out there."

" Deadpool by Wayne J. Keeley
",0.0,0.9873,2019-12-04 00:00:00,9,"Another Marvel hero takes to the big screen (and toy stores) increasing the coffers of both Disney and Marvel. The big question is, does Deadpool work? Will it become a successful franchise like Spiderman or will it be relegated to on-demand movie abandon like both Fantastic Four movies and the old Daredevil film with Ben Affleck? One thing is for sure, even if a superstar actor bombs in a superhero film, he/she will still have a chance to make a comeback as a different hero (e.g., both Ryan Reynolds and Ben Affleck are prime examples).So again, does the movie work? I would have to say a resounding yes. But it doesn't work (at least for me) because of the action sequences or the gore (and that's a bit odd since I am a B-horror schlock junkie). It works because of the witty writing and Reynolds performance as the snarky superhero.Before he was the snarky Deadpool, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) was a snarky ex-special forces-type-mercenary/equalizer. He falls in love with a stripper (Morena Baccarin). On the verge of their happily-ever-after he finds out he has terminal cancer. As a last ditch attempt at life he subjects himself to an underground procedure whose promoters promise to make him a mutant superhero. They fulfill their promise, but turn him into an ugly, monstrous looking one. The movie follows his quest to find his sadistic creator Ajax aka Francis (Ed Skrein) who he is determined to strong arm into making him normal again. Of course, Ajax is part of a grand conspiracy to make mercenaries for hire (not superheroes) so there are a lot of bad guys to take down along the way.Like his comic pool alter ego, the cinematic Deadpool loves violence, gore, sarcasm and breaking the fourth wall. As my sixteen-year-old marvel comic book enthusiast advises, Deadpool is the closest movie to the comics. Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast as the sardonic yet comedic superhero. T.J. Miller, known more for his stand-up then his acting (at this point in time although I am certain this will change after Deadpool) is hilarious as the deadpan, joke-spouting Weasel who runs the local mercenary hangout. I am sure that many of his lines were ad-libbed. (I can't wait for the X-rated gag reel soon to be released showing what they couldn't show in the R-rated film.)The best part of the movie was recognizing the countless pop culture references and inside jokes that were made. One source lists the references at 200 (don't people have jobs? Who has time to count the references in a movie?) There are many leveled at the comic book rivalry between Deadpool and Wolverine, but the jokes cross the line to become ad hominin attacks on Hugh Jackman who played Wolverine. My favorite ""eggs,"" however, were the really subtle ones that you had to think about. Ajax's sidekick Angel Dust (Gina Carano) constantly chews the end of a matchstick, prompting Deadpool to quip ""Do you have an oral fixation complex or are you just a Stallone fan?"" The matchstick reference was to Stallone's character in Cobra, one of his lesser known creations.This is definitely not a movie for the young ones. Risqué jokes and sexual innuendoes fly faster than speeding bullets. There is a noticeable pansexuality that Reynolds brings to the character as well. (Reynolds reportedly wanted a boyfriend for Deadpool.)Special shout outs must be given to Karan Soni for his part as the love-stricken cabdriver, Dopinder, and Brianna Hildebrand for her offbeat portrayal as Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Kudos to the director, Tim Miller, and writers Rob Liefield, Fabian Nicieza, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick for bringing a different kind of Marvel movie to life.If I had any criticisms, they would include the lack of a real villain or a deadly flaw in Deadpool's character. While Ajax was a formidable nemesis, if one thinks about it, Deadpool got what he wanted - a cancer cure. Trading in terminal cancer for immortality is not a bad trade even if you are left ugly in the process. After all, beauty is only skin deep. Additionally, there was no real danger to Deadpool at any point in time. Even Wolverine has been threatened with REAL death. (Although my son tells me there will be a serum developed down the road that will be harmful to Deadpool.)While not as engaging or well-rounded from a story or character perspective as Marvel's Ant-Man , Deadpool was thoroughly enjoyable, funny and worth staying past the credits to see the post-movie snippet (which I will not ruin here)."

",0.6486,0.934,2019-10-14 00:00:00,8,"What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right."

",0.4019,0.9296,2019-09-21 00:00:00,1,"This film will be great fodder for MST3000. It has great special effects, and will make you laugh because the acting is almost as bad as the dialogue. The film has no socially redeeming value, is anti-intellectual, anti-logical, anti-science, anti-math and anti-child. Other than that, the film is fine for arrested development IQs under 80. The film has nothing to do with Spiderman, Stan Lee, or the Marvel comics of the early 60s. It has everything to do with mindless violence that totters on the hilarious, dialogue that must have been written in the John during a lunch break, and no actors or directors. The editing is pretty good, however. So if you want to watch a film with good special effects and editing, but absolutely nothing else of any consequence, than this film is for you. If you want a story or acting, I would suggest you go to ANY other film ANYWHERE else. These Quintin Tarrantino wannabes really good me a good laugh. By the way, there is scientific proof that the lead actor is completely brainless at the conclusion of the film. An antagonist (bad guy for those who watch the film), drills a bolt inside the temple of our hero, which, if he had a brain, would have killed him instantly, but since there is nothing but absolute air between his ears, it will merely result in a nasty cut that will heal in about a week.

Deadpool has everything, good directing, good filmography, good writing, good acting, good story, also it has comedy, tragedy, action, dirty stuff, narrator (Deadpool himself), etc etc.
That said, there is barely any film that has all the elements possible and still work out great, when a team of film makers try to induce many of these elements in one work they most likely ruin their own work and it comes out very tacky and unpleasant, but not in this one.
At first I rated it 9 but tonight when I thought about it in my mind I gave the perfect score.
Even though it uses so many cliches, it still has a high level of creativity.
Also I very much liked that Deadpool is not another (as a figure of spesch) a ""hero"" - who doesn't kill-.
I must say, this film was so good that a comic character whom was not a popular and even infamous and unpleasant character became one of the most popular and likable characters."

In theory this film should be a total train wreck, with a form of comedy that is hard to nail. I think what makes Deadpool make this work is that the fourth wall jokes aren't the only source of comedy, being there is slap stick, character driven and visual comedy to boot. I feel that Deadpool's entire story is a fourth wall break, seemingly every character acts in a strange and vile way, such as Wades girlfriend reacting how anyone would after seeing Wades face instead of power couple ""You're still beautiful"" line being thrown in, she instead reacts how someone actually would, playing a standard trope for a joke, by making the characters more nuisanced. The fact that the plot is very predictable as well, which though is a down fall of the film is the entire point and why I prefer this one over the sequel, as it just sticks to a standard superhero story.Overall, though the reception of this film can be seen as mixed, in my opinion this is one of the best Superhero films, ever, and though it will fade into obscurity due to the new instalments in the fantastic MCU, I will always remember this as one of my favourites."

",0.5719,0.985,2019-07-19 00:00:00,9,"Here's my review of deadpool, so needless to say Ryan Reynolds was great as deadpool more of a type casted persona like capn jack ,the movie has great camera scenes without too much explosions like a Michael bay movie,it turned out to have a steady cam ,which shows you exactly what is going on,the role of dark humour and smirk comedy is hilarious I bet Zach galafaniakas couldn't have stood a chance,the thing which made feel like I was punched in the tummy thrice was the fact that the dumb Indian censor board had to cut off the scene where deadpool kills 3 guys with a bullet.And the supporting characters were really great and the pop cultural refs and slapstick humour had its place .In the end deadpool is a notable movie in the golden age of superhero movies and of all it has a great story with awesome characters and the guy who played the recent transporter sucked like anything. If you ask me if you could take your little cousin ,then this is no movie for him and I mean it ,and don't blame me if your little cousin becomes Frankenstein Jr."

The unconventional origin is great with the flash backs from the bridge battle. The action is great. Ajax is more of an eh villain but I think that is the point. The bridge battle is great along with the final battle. Also the soundtrack is awesome. Did I mention that it is hilarious?

A group of 'bad guys' sells him on an 'alternative cure' that works, he can heal himself of anything, and it also gives him other superpowers, but it leaves him horribly disfigured. The rest of the movie he chases the men that disfigured him and, from the shadows, stalks/follows the 'love/lust of his life'. Lots of bloody gore and some T&A action. Lots of cheesy witticisms.

" Deadpool
",0.0,0.9919,2019-05-24 00:00:00,9,"I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon."

" What, in the name of Canada, is this garbage?
",0.0,-0.9906,2019-05-06 00:00:00,4,"How does one know when a civilisation is doomed? When a film like ""Deadpool"" makes 363 million dollars at the American box-office and 783 worldwide, that's when. The film is a wretched experience - the result of what might happen if a sixth former were to be given a couple of miles of film stock; all the money in the world and then told to go shoot something. It is a violent, unpleasant circus; a mess of postmodernism, a disturbing freakshow of special effects and the grotesque - I am staggered that there exist people in the world who do not think that the film is a badly judged, poorly made piece of repugnant exhibitionism which saps the soul and dulls the mind. Decades ago, a film like ""The Mask"" demonstrated that you don't have to be rude to be funny; now, ""Deadpool"" informs us that you can be almost totally irredeemable but cool.Indeed, not since ""The Mask"" have I seen a lead physically interact with the fabrics of a cinematic universe as intently as Deadpool does here. At various points in the film, in no particular order, the lead will do all of the following: fast-forward the movie; insult other off-screen superheroes; break the fourth-wall within a fourth-wall breaking flashback; stick chewing gum to the camera and then later actually pan the camera away using his hand so that we may not gaze upon an especially violent moment.We all smirked when we first saw ""Pulp Fiction"" and heard a character literally re-tune the radio over the opening credits, but very little of any of this is as clever as it thinks. Nor is it especially ground-breaking - films as diverse as ""Man Bites Dog"" and ""Breathless"" had been experimenting with these sorts of tropes years earlier, while the putting of it to a series of sword-violence just reminded me of ""Kill-Bill"". ""Man Bites Dog"" (to which ""Deadpool"" probably owes the greatest debt), for instance, even includes a scene whereby the Deadpool-style psychopath the camera crew follow around quite literally edits a scene of the movie himself, so insinuating that it is he who is putting the whole project together.""Deadpool"" is about an ex-special forces soldier-turned-street punk named Wade Wilson, who is portrayed by Ryan Reynolds. Wilson mooches around collecting debts and sorting out problems amongst the scum of the city - in his own words, he is a bad guy whose job it is to mess with even worse guys. His best friend Weasel (T.J. Miller), who owns a local tavern, and his girlfriend is sex-worker Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). This was all before he suddenly contracted cancer and had to undergo treatment; something he did so through an organisation headed up by a shady, suited individual who looks conspicuously like Max Keiser. But the organisation was not quite what was advertised, and following complications which disfigure him, he becomes the character of Deadpool: a red tracksuit sporting super-freak extremely well-versed in katana blades and with little else on his mind but revenge.And that is, broadly speaking, the end of it - the set-up is an excuse for a series of scenes depicting little more than bloody carnage, each as spectacularly dull as the last: what is the point in verbally mocking superhero films and the action genre if you're just going to fall into being a mindless one yourself? As a lead, Deadpool is an incredibly simplistic character - doing under his new identity more or less what he did under his old one, only on a bigger and bloodier scale. Nothing really characterises him - he shares no duality with a villain as there is no real villain, merely a fellow punk who worked at the medical facility with whom he had a few cross-words. The character, made invulnerable during the treatment, results in there being no suspense to any of the set-pieces. What are we thus even watching? Is there a statement being made, about violence in popular culture, or otherwise? Was there a remark in there on America's healthcare system that I missed?Sad though it is to say, films such as ""Deadpool"" are where mainstream American cinema finds itself: big, brash and bombastic but with nothing actually to it. The film left me feeling empty; I was sad when it ended, but sad for civilisation and cinema - sad that there were people out there who genuinely thought the contents of this piece were what people wanted to see and might make for a substantial film-going experience. Is there a better example of a film which might act as the epitome of our society's slow, inevitable culture-death than Tim Miller's 2016 effort here? Today's age, characterised by fatuity and crudity, is perfectly positioned to produce the miserable experience that-is ""Deadpool"". That it garners such awesome praise, and makes such vast amounts of money, is surely the signal that what we were warned about all those years ago has finally come to pass."
" Everything Deadpool Should Be
",0.0,0.9985,2019-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Deadpool might be the most original and innovative comic book movie yet. Not innovative in terms of the story or most of the characters, but in the execution and the title character, Deadpool. Now, I was not very familiar with Deadpool before this film. I first learned of the character's existence when playing the video game, Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Ever since, I've seen the character hyped-up like mad in the geek community, which surprised me considering I didn't even know of the character until recently at that time.The first attempted to bring this character to the big screen was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which did not go over well to say the least. They didn't seem to get the character at all. I didn't even know much about Deadpool then, but I knew enough to know they dropped the ball in portraying him. This film feels very much like an apology for that train wreck.Well, apology accepted! Deadpool was an extremely fun and exciting film. On the surface it seems like another superhero/revenge movie like The Punisher, Dirty Harry, Deathwish, and so on, but that's not the case.It sounds incredibly formulaic on paper but it all comes down to execution, which this film does right. It doesn't take itself that seriously. This film is as much a comedy as it is a superhero/revenge flick. In fact, it's more of a comedy. I think it's great how this film can poke fun at all the clichés of these kinds of films and, at the same time, embrace them. This movie reminds me of the anime One Punch Man in that regard, and it works for many of the same reasons.This time around, the studio truly nailed what the character, Deadpool, is from the costume to his dark sense of humor. There is no doubt we're going to much more of Deadpool in movies in the future which I'm fine with. It's great that Marvel isn't the only studio that is taking more obscure characters and making them mainstream. I might have to read some Deadpool comics now.The production values are great as well. The action is top notch, the violence is on point, the effects are great, and it's competently shot. They even got two X-Men in the film which I did not see coming. But they turned out to be welcome additions that brought some good humor and action scenes. These X-Men look more comic book-esc than the X-Men in any of the X-Men movies thus far. In fact, this might be 20th Century Fox's first comic book film that is the closest to being a comic book yet. The closest being the first two (official) Fantastic Four movies.The film has a couple minor issues for me. There's quite a lot of raunchy humor in the film which I didn't care for. While I know it's a part of Deadpool's character, I'm not the biggest fan of that type of humor. I think it's the lowest form of humor, second only to fart humor. But, fortunately, there were plenty of other jokes to offset it. Most of the other jokes hit, particularly the fourth wall jokes.Overall, Deadpool is definitely the film the character deserved. The film is not for everyone. If you're squeamish or don't like raunchy humor this is probably not for you. If you know what you're getting into you should enjoy yourself."
" Good Movie
",0.4404,0.9519,2019-04-18 00:00:00,10,"A Good Movie in X-Men Series...
I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy."

The film is rated R with blood squibs, filed with explosive action, I love this film from end till end, it is one of my favorites. It has jokes and humor I was laughing, the same time I enjoyed a bloody action sequences. In the opening scene you have a bad-ass action sequences in which Deadpool jumps in too van beating thugs. On a bridge is fantastic sequence in which Deadpool has only 12 shots in his IWI Desert Eagle Mark XIX gun and he kills bad guys one by one while mercenaries are firing at him with machine guns.The best thing is the Ajax's motorcycle mercenaries use the Heckler & Koch MP5K against Deadpool firing thousand rounds on him dodging Deadpool's gun firing bullets at the motorcyclist. Maximum Effort is a bad-ass theme for Deadpool that is why I enjoy the film so much for the action and humor. Ryan Ryanolds know how too make a good movie. Deadpool bullet countdown scene awesome in which he counts bullets before he kills bad-guys he shots with one bullet a mercenary in the grenade causing explosion bad-ass. This is a bad-ass action film but it is also an origin story about Wade Wilson how he become Deadpool.The movie isn't about superhero who has a nice life or is rich or billionaire no Slade Wilson is poor he has a hard life. He has to earn his money with hard work. He is an ex special forces operative now a criminal as an mercenary helping youth people like he save a young girl from a stalker a real stalker yes he was mean he still saved a young girl of course he was paid. He meet his girlfriend who is a prostitute and he lives normal life until he finds out he has cancer because he doesn't want to die he accepts invention for faculty for experimental treatment for his cancer. He is taken to Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They torture him until the faculty prison doesn't explode caused by Wilson while Ajax stabbed him with an iron stick Wade Wilson survives and promise revenge on Francis Freeman / Ajax (Ed Skrein) Honestly one of the best rated R action films I have seen.I absolutely love Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool he Is a bad-ass in this movie not only he jokes but he acts really believable. Love his character I love the action sequences. Gina Carano is in this movie and she is a bad-ass the fight sequence between her and Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) is excellent in the movie. Stefan Kapicic who provides the voice for Colossus is excellent right from the comic book his character. Brianna Hildebrand is Negasonic Teenage Warhead she is likable her character is a good superhero Character. Ed Skrein as Francis Freeman / Ajax is a great psychopath villain who tortures innocent people with his experiments until Deadpool stops him. Morena Baccarin as Vanessa as a good love interest of Wade Wilson.I love the ending sequence in which Deadpool recruits Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead to help him fight against Francis Freeman / Ajax and Angel Dust that is a bad-as action ever, love the rescue mission on Vanessa.Tim Miller directed perfectly this movie that I had blast watching it. The action sequences in this movie are completely insane that is why it is so good film. I would gave this movie a 10 but the song Chicago You're The Inspiration by Berracelik in which Vanessa lies and you see some animated animals and that song plays that scene ruined the movie for me, sounds from ""The Karate Kid Part II"" The Glory of Love - Peter Cetera that is why I hate that song in this movie, that is why I gave a 9 which is a good score. The soundtracks could have been better in this movie, there Is neither one soundtrack that I like in here. The rest of the film I enjoy and I love it. It is fast paced and goes quickly around.Just too let you know this isn't the greatest film of all time, the best one, but it is a damn good action film I recommend it."
" Top Notch Superhero Flick - One of My Favorites
",0.5574,0.8925,2019-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Deadpool is it. This movie has all the drama, action, comedy, and, yes, romance you can imagine nestled up really tight in a warm, cozy bundle.Ryan Reynolds shines as the main character, who through a lab experiment gone wrong, becomes an immortal fighting legend. And so it goes, he must take revenge on the ones that did it to him. And so he does.This movie has blood and guts, and action to knock your socks off. The comedy is what sets this movie apart, and it graciously gives us everything it's got.Highly recommended.9 stars (though it may deserve 8)"

I hope Deadpool gets to meet Ryan Reynold's Green Lantern. Ryan Reynolds should totally where the green lantern mask more. I wonder what the green lantern mask feels like. 10 out of 10 movie Would recommend watching Green Lantern with girlfriend if you love her.P.S. How much for the Green Lantern mask?
" Try-hard dross topped such mundane Hollywood humour.
",0.4767,0.8847,2019-01-16 00:00:00,5,"This is another one of those movies that try to be fresh in its genre (which it does achieve) but try exceptionally hard to sound witty and unfunny (which it didn't achieve) and instead end up being downright annoying. Sure there are parts that I really enjoyed, but with the amount of hype this had, I expected it to be the movie of the century. Try Kick-Ass if you want an actual laugh out loud experience. This ""Oooh I'm different from all superheroes because I'm arrogant and funny and quick witted"" character didn't work and it's not because I didn't get or get offended by the humour. Sometimes it was funny and cool, but 9/10 the jokes just made me roll my eyes. Nice try though. Oh and it is incredibly violent throughout for your average superhero viewing so be warned. I'm not sure if that made me like or hate the movie more, it was just an added feature that did nothing to fuel a reaction from me."
" Not the typical superhero film
",0.0,0.9529,2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"After watching superhero movies like Ant-man and Ant-Man and Wasp recently, along with Iron Man, X-Man, and others in the past, this movie stands apart. You may ask how. Well for one, the protagonist Deadpool is the narrator and he refuses to be classified as a superhero, seeing himself as more of a bad guy fighting other bad guys. So in that way, perhaps the film does subvert the superhero genre. Perhaps its funny as well. Still, like every superhero movie, it connects to the others (apparently more so in Deadpool 2), creating a Marvel Universe web, bringing more money in for Hollyweird producers.This movie does tie into the X-Man movies, but it also has its own style. I think it effectively uses the tactic of talking to the camera, which doesn't always work in these movies, but it does work here. The playful nature of this movie, which is still relatively violent, should make it no surprise that this film did relatively well at the box office. You could also say that this film is part of an anti-hero superhero movie brand and that is probably accurate as well, but it does not pull away from the nature of this movie as a whole.All in all, this is a fun movie. I don't think I would watch it again, but it was a nice break from other movies, especially typical superhero movies, nonetheless."

" Off Balanced Dark Superhero Comedy
",0.3612,0.9571,2019-01-12 00:00:00,7,"29 September 2016. I'm reminded of Wil Smith in Hancock (2008) which was more of a superhero crime drama than a superhero dark comedy action as Deadpool. Nevertheless, perhaps its the contemporary times of change and loosening of societal morals that the gutter talk of sex and swearing like young boys and late night comics within a superhero movie was inevitable. While the dark humor is creative and at times refreshing, it really seems more like a stand up comic night with a lot of R-rated one-liners. Even Deadpool noted the absence of a lot of superheroes in this movie. The fusion of comedy, action, and then a severe transitions to romantic drama, along with the constant cynicism much better presented in Hancock, made for a jarring experience with a movie without a consistent tone. Along with a lot of Kill Bill death-dealing and death-defying action, this movie seems more like a testosterone action entertainment thriller for boys rather than anything really seriously award winning. The one redeeming element of the movie was Ryan Reynold's delicate and remarkable performance."

This is definitely a different 'Deadpool' than in 'Origins:Wolverine'. Also, I would've understood if they really want to get this Deadpool character from the Marvel comics on the screen that is too talkative and breaks the 4th wall, but almost every character in this movie is partly a comedian. For me it was too much, I prefer serious movies and parts were good, but overall this was over the top and honestly I got headaches from this movie cause it's exhausting to bear a forced comedy.
Maybe it's a good movie for binge-watching, but not my cup of tea.
I guess it's good they introduced the 'funny' Deadpool character now for future Marvel movies where he would only play a small part, I'd prefer that. Or maybe I just need to let this movie sink in, cause I don't think I hate the Deadpool character they presented, it's just, it was too much at one point."

I did not like the graphic part of his origin. I hated seeing him tortured by his captor Ajax.

Keep in mind they where low on money and had a low budget, so they couldn't perfect it. Just my opinion, watch the movie twice. Once to take in the action and the other to listen to the story. that's what I do when I don't understated a movie. I go back and watch it again, but this time I listen to the story. Some people say that this movie has no story and that's OK. All they did was watch it once, judged it, and never spoke about it again.

There is all the swearing, brutal violence, blood, dismemberment, jokes, irreverence and meta-references that you would expect. Every scene with a serious tone is completely cut out by jokes, but this is still a bit more of a movie with plot and characters and motivation and all that sort of jazz. Definitely tried a little harder to make more of a narrative than ""guy kills dude to save girlfriend"".The stakes are really only relevant to those on-screen. Sure, there might be some larger implications if you really think about it, but they're never stated. The implications that are stated are small time, but that makes the stakes personal and better for a plot involving a bunch of selfish characters.Its also nice to have a movie that doesn't take itself seriously in a time where most blockbusters with ridiculous premises are also trying to be like ""BUT THIS IS REAL LIFE!""Its more of what was successful. The same dish, but they just changed the presentation. That isn't a bad thing."
" Tries pathetically hard to be 'edgy' & 'sexy.' Overhyped Garbage.
",-0.4939,0.9614,2018-07-21 00:00:00,1,"Tries so hard to be funny by using purile and dirty humour that is actually pretty sexist in a machismo kind of way. I presume that one reason this film is so popular just because Deadpool is pansexual, because it's so wonderful and ""sexy"" in the trendsetting banalities framework of the films like this rather than just being treated like a sexuality like any other. Another reason I hate this film is because it is being touted as though it is edgy and brilliant. Just because, what? There's a load of meaningless gore and sexual references? God, they must live sheltered lives with little juvenile minds. To call this film one big exercise in juvenility would be an insult to young people. Patronising would probably be better."

The cast has a amazing cast with Ryan Reynolds leading as Wade/ Deadpool and the energy that he brings to Wade and the comedy is why i love this movie and why the braking the 4th wall works. also in the cast is Ed Skrein who plays Ajax/ Francis and he is a villian you would not want to mess with and he works well as a villian and he is not boring or not interesting and that is very good to see for a villian like him in a x-men universe. Also in the cast is Karan Soni, Stefan Kapicic,Brianna Hildebrand,Morena Baccarin,T.J. Miller,Leslie Uggams and Gina Carano the cast is well balanced with lots of diferent talents thrown in.
I love deadpool it is finally the movie that we all wanted and it satisfied the inner comic book movie nerd in me and was funny and filled with action and has plenty of 4th wall braking which is right for the character of deadpool and also the way that we get the origin of deadpool and it's a movie that i can watch mamy many times and still love"

",0.6696,0.9824,2018-07-18 00:00:00,10,The atmosphere was great. The merc with a mouth was given justice in this film adaptation. Ryan Reynolds was the perfect choice as Deadpool. He's wisecracking and really takes anything seriously. You gotta love the constant fourth wall breaks and easter eggs in this movie. The story's nothing new but still pretty great as the way it's told has originality and action scenes that further the story still. Morena Baccarin was also great. She holds her own in this movie. Enough said though you need to watch this movie as that's how good it is.

",0.0,0.9097,2018-06-07 00:00:00,7,"Former special Ops solider and now a mercenary, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is enjoying a passionate relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). On the day he proposes, he collapses and discovers that he has very late stage cancer. Desperate, he agrees to undergo a mysterious procedure that will cure him and also make him a ""hero"" but the procedure actually involves activing his latent mutant genes following extensive torture. Left for dead, Wilson's mutant healing factor saves his life and allows him to pull on a red suit, call himself Deadpool and strike out for revenge. The plot is only half the fun though, less than half in fact. With the shackles off and a relatively low budget mitigating much of the risk, ""Deadpool"" is a violent, foul mouthed action-comedy, with Reynolds and writers allowed to crack jokes about their careers, the state of superhero movies and other facets of pop culture as Deadpool breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience.This was my third or fourth viewing of the film, watched ahead of seeing the sequel. If I am truthful, some of the lustre does start to come off after a few repeat viewings. Some of the more accessible comedy moments, the trailer ones particular - like Angels' ""superhero landing"" gag are all a bit too familiar now. It's interesting though that the self-referential style of humour has permeated outside of ""Deadpool"" to become common place in the subsequent films of the MCU, if not quite to the extent that it does here. Plot wise, it's all fairly straightforward despite some time jumps in the first two thirds of the film. For the budget though, the action scenes are pretty strong, particularly the scenes involving a downed helicarrier at the conclusion.Still good, just overexposed a little now. Chuck on another two stars if you've not seen it before."
" Brilliantly witty, entertaining and emotionally engaging. A Brilliant new way to tell tired old superhero stories.
",0.8807,-0.9101,2018-06-07 00:00:00,9,"I've heard it being talked about but only saw it last week for the first time. In terms of its genre, it's a brilliant movie, well crafted story line, brilliantly scripted. It does something different with the super hero we've never seen like this before. He's lovable, the story is heart wrenching, you (I) want him to beat the hell out of the evil villains he's fighting. I've never experienced that before about a villain in a superhero movie. Usually the villains are very stereotypical and don't evoke the passion Deadpool did for me. I really really wanted to see the horrible man squashed to smithereens for being so evil and inflicting so much pain on innocent people. 
Daredevil's villain was suitably evil and cold but the characterisation didn't evoke such a strong emotional response for me. 
I'm not a batman or superman fan, but I do love a bit of science fiction, and Deadpool ventures far enough into a bit of sciency reasoning for his superpowers to fascinate me. The fight scenes I'm usually just waiting for them to end so we can move onto the next story, but with Deadpool they were interesting, they weren't just bashing each other up in cool ways, they had wit and humour in them, which I loved."

Not long after a series of ""treatments"", he receives regenerative superpowers which he's about to use in a way only he can.In this first installment of Deadpool, we're presented the origins of the notorious character, how he was before getting his powers, how he receives them and how he uses them in good or evil. Treated with plenty of humor, determined to make the viewer laugh with every occasion, it tries to be as entertaining as possible, even attempting to introduce emotion, drama and suspense.Unfortunately, the final result isn't as expected. As far as the story goes, it isn't anything mind blowing or something, just ok. The characters are ok as well with little complexity or implication, doing little to make the overall experience great. The special effects are also ok, leaving a somewhat sensation of mediocrity. Unfortunately for me, the fun part also left to be desired, as it seemed to be trying too much and finally not realizing much.As, an overall experience, it managed to maintain interest, to avoid boredom and be sometimes funny, but it ended up as an average movie."

" In the company of nonsense
",-0.4019,0.9988,2018-06-04 00:00:00,9,"A sharp-tongued mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) loves the girl of easy virtue Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and is going to marry her. Idylls come to an end when doctors diagnose Wade's incurable stage of cancer. In the hope of remaining alive, he agrees to participate in an experimental program, whose creators promise not only to cure Wilson, but also to endow him with superpowers. Wade becomes immortal, but his face is disfigured, and in this form he is not going to return to his beloved - wearing a mask and taking the name Deadpool, the new mutant must find the one who turned it into a monster and make it return its former beauty.Even if until recently you have not heard anything about Deadpool, the creators of the project about the talkative ""non-perperable"" have done everything to correct this oversight. The promo campaign of the project was unprecedented, then positioning it as a romantic comedy for Valentine's Day, then advertising billboards with emoji. Over the past months, it has been decidedly impossible to get away from Deadpool, and it worked perfectly, given that Wilson is one of the few comic book heroes who constantly interacts with the audience and knows that they are being watched by the parties.This chip is 100% used in the debutant Tim Miller's film, which the Oscar nominee in the category of animated shorts hopes to punch his way to Hollywood. The new Deadpool, unlike the silent assassin who appeared in Wolverine, is exactly what his fans wanted to see. He does not stop, he jokes with a joke and severely annihilates his enemies, while being able to regularly remind him that he is very pleased with the company of spectators.Destruction of the notorious fourth wall is the highlight of ""Deadpool"", which seems to make it closer to the public. Like, this guy is talking to you, he's in the board. He listens to the same music as you, watches the same films and jokes the same way. In terms of humor, the film, of course, tries to please everyone and everything: Stebut film adaptation of the X-Men, Hugh Jackman and Liam Neeson, but at the same time, very often Hochma is not of the most intellectual kind, which would have done the honor of writing a sorting comedy. And between the gags of different categories it is not possible to establish even a shaky balance - the scales bow inexorably to the side where they laugh at everything below the belt. Is it less than that? Let's make a discount on the specifics of the main character - after all, he does not have everything in order. And, as practice shows, all the same it is much easier to attract a mass audience with a vulgar joke beyond the foul, rather than trying to humor subtly and intellectually.If you can argue about the comic component - it eventually turns out all the same to an amateur - then visually ""Deadpool"" problems do not arise. The introductory action-scene is so ingenious that it raises the bar very high - it's hard to reach it later, but it's rather a script problem that does not offer the protagonist really serious trials. And with ordinary problems in the face of armed scoundrels (and even the main ""boss""), Deadpool copes easily and more than spectacularly - the benefit of the studio has agreed to an adult rating, which allows, without hesitation, to dismember bodies and splash blood in all directions.Do not expect from the ""Deadpool"" swirling drama - this story is simple and trivial. And in it there is really little heroic, but a lot of romance, because the main engine of the plot is the desire of a man to look good and like his woman. Primitivism with a touch of nostalgia, which plays great in contrast to the profound modern films about superheroes, where questions of a far more global character are being solved. Deadpool is different, and it can not be bad or good - it's just that way."

After reading some comics and watching clips online it became apparent that Ryan Reynolds is the only person who could play this role and does he ever knock it out of the park. His passion for this character is not only apparent on screen, but off the screen.It's action packed and hilarious with great fourth wall breaks and Easter eggs that you'll only discover all of them on multiple viewings. The Merc With The Mouth has come a long way since Wolverine. It's also worth noting that this film changed the genre by making way for more R-Rates comic book adaptations like Logan.

" Great fun
",0.8126,0.9946,2018-05-20 00:00:00,7,"The main triumph of Deadpool is its capability of making its title character sympathetic yet wildly outrageous with his inappropriate sense of humor. Ryan Reynolds certainly deserves much of the credit for this because of his unequivocal commitment to the role; any hesitation or lack of conviction in Deadpool's lines would significantly lessen his character's appeal. Reynolds manages to make Deadpool seem lovable in his most irreverent moments as well as his most vulnerable. However, Deadpool is mostly allowed to get away with his heinous crimes because he is trying to save the ""perfect"" girl against an undeniably evil villain. The writers go all in with both of these overused elements. In any other superhero movie, his romance and revenge quest would be trite, but the enthusiastically delivered snarky jokes overshadow this. 
The humor in Deadpool is for the immature at heart, and isn't nearly as clever as it would like to think. Attempts to poke fun at the superhero genre aren't necessary and seem forced at times. Luckily, the movie is funny enough in its own right to cover for these missteps. The main laughs come from Deadpool's interactions with colorful characters such as his girlfriend, a confused taxi driver, a blind African American woman, and two superhumans. The secondary characters complement Reynolds well despite their limited development and screen time. 
The movie is a joyride until the third act, where unfortunately the requisite action takes precedence over both humor and narrative. The drawn-out battle sequence is bearable for a while because Deadpool is a sympathetic character, but it eventually overplays its welcome. Two characters are present for seemingly no reason at all except for comedic relief (and perhaps sequel material).When the action finally does come to an end, it is abrupt and the movie makes no concluding message. Thus, Deadpool certainly deserves the praise it gets for tapping into a creative use of the superhero genre, but it should not be lauded as groundbreaking. It's pure fun; nothing more, nothing less."

But with that also had some bland moments. Really, just the whole aesthetic of it.It was also clever to not have this be the highest budgeted movie ever. It paved way to have gigs on this broke dude making fun of how much these heroes are and studio deals that has to go through.But with that, the origin story pushed the movie back. We could've had more Deadpool time. This is the troubling concern.The movie had too many themes as the origin story continued. It tried to have a cool revenge story and then filled the movie with a bunch of blocks about Deadpool's little past bits as himself b.d. (before Deadpool). Still, this didn't give much weight to Wade Wilson, as he kept on doin funny jokes and 4th wall-breaking to fit his superhero persona.So yeah, gigs and revenge (maybe love story too).

" Live Long, Deadpool
",0.0,0.9716,2018-05-12 00:00:00,4,"Disney chief executive Bob Iger sat down for an interview with the BBC and uttered a sentence that horrified most of the film world's highbrow crowd - or at least those who consider themselves above the pleasures of a superhero blockbuster: ""With Marvel, you're dealing with thousands and thousands of characters - that will go on forever."" Forever, yes.Nobody should have been surprised by Iger's statement; the man is in the business of making comic-book movies, and his company is obviously going to keep doing so until it has exploited every possible avenue of profit. But that doesn't mean we're all doomed to an eternity of rote superhero formulaics - films where the wisecracking, white-bread hero saves the day while doing everything right, for all the right reasons.Like any other cinematic genre, the superhero movie is one ripe with opportunity for invention - even subversion. Hollywood may envision a never-ending future of spandex-heavy adventures, but, like the once-inescapable and once-beloved western, the superhero film can be twisted and torqued to last for decades. We've already witnessed some mild pivots: the sleek and gory vision of Guillermo del Toro's Blade II, for instance, or the crude and immoral antics of Kick-Ass. As some filmmakers - and the daring or possibly oblivious studios behind them - have come to realize, if we must live in an era of superheroes, let's at least make things interesting.To call the new film Deadpool merely interesting, though, would be an understatement. It stars not a patriotic Ubermensch out to protect the world, but a reprehensible killing machine interested only in literally saving his own face. His superpowers aren't flashy, just gross. And his weapons of choice aren't mighty fists that knock out - yet never kill - but assault rifles, grenades and swords soaked in enemy blood.In short, Deadpool is everything that Hollywood has raised audiences to believe heroes are not: crass, selfish and with a vocabulary that would have made George Carlin blush. Yet here he is on the big screen, slicing and dicing his way through his own origin story, one that somehow exists within the squeaky-clean X-Men cinematic universe.The plot is refreshingly simple and low-stakes. Deadpool (a.k.a. Wade Wilson, a.k.a. the walking, talking smirk that is actor Ryan Reynolds) is a simple mercenary who's out for revenge after a generic British bad guy (Ed Skrein) mutates him, leaving his face a scarred, Freddy Krueger-like wreck. There are a few side characters in the mix - including a disappointingly one-note hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold girlfriend played with verve by Morena Baccarin - and amusing cameos, but this is mostly Deadpool's show, and he's eager to steal it.The film has long been a passion project for Reynolds - who played a watered-down version of the same character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine - and the actor clearly relishes the opportunity. His Deadpool is an irrepressibly charming madman - as if a standup comedian decided one day to drop the mic and pick up a Glock. If Reynolds lays it on a bit thick here and there and everywhere, it's only because he's scared 20th Century Fox will wake up and realize what they've unleashed upon the world, and he'll never get such a chance again. (It's not every day that a major studio film, for instance, features a love scene in which the hero is sodomized by his girlfriend in a loving act of sexual exploration.)Yet it would be dishonest to call Deadpool something truly subversive. Sure, the title character often pauses the violent action to break the fourth wall, and there are many winking meta-references to the genre as a whole, including Reynolds' disastrous outing as Green Lantern. But first-time feature director Tim Miller has created a work that's both aggressive and not aggressive enough.Deadpool is a cold-blooded killer, but one who still must save a damsel in distress. He's a smart-ass, but only about half of his jokes land. And while the film's violence takes squishy delight in showing how real-world bodies would react to otherworldly superpowers, the action is strangely muted in sections and poorly executed in others. It's cultural irreverence designed for the mainstream.Still, as Iger and the rest of Hollywood prepare for an endless era of comic-book franchises, it's heartening to glimpse a future where not everything is wrapped up in a tidy package. As Deadpool himself well knows, sometimes you just have to play dirty."

",0.3818,0.9924,2018-05-02 00:00:00,10,"The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity.

" Finally! An X-Rated X-Men movie
",0.0,0.9191,2018-04-13 00:00:00,10,"Hilarious from beginning to end! 
All of these low reviews are from people that must never see rates R comedies or action movies! 
Not only did it show an ""anti-hero"" X-Man, but it successfully blended in a love story as well as showing a convincing origin story. 
Yes there's sex, language and violence but none is inappropriate for a mutant anti hero that is in love and wants to become ""normal"" again. 
I've heard worse language, that is unnecessary and out of place, in many action movies; more ill placed and horribly long runs of violence in movies like The Matrix sequels ( which, by the way, for the most part I enjoyed ) and horror movies; and inappropriate sex scenes in all of the above. 
In this movie, everything fits, which is rare. 
It's rated R so common sense tells you this isn't a kids movie and was never meant to be. 
There are a lot of X-Men movies I'd never watch more then once, mostly because they have become repetitive and far from unique. This was a refreshing change for people like me that are not comic buffs and need the whole back story explained to me from someone who is. 
I would say, if you're have a bad day and need to laugh, watch this movie. It will not disappoint, no matter how many times you've seen it!"

" What is this world coming to?
",0.0,0.9237,2018-04-04 00:00:00,5,"There was a time in film making history where movies were much more family oriented, wholesome for both children and adults. That isn't to say there wasn't already a separation between children and adult films. Though adult films were approached more conservatively and were cautious about how they were presented. That approach has been lost today in society as morality is being forgotten as something of the past and the future is immorality. This is Deadpool as a film.Ryan Reynolds was undoubtedly the perfect choice to play the iconic character Deadpool, the foul-mouthed, sexually active, vulgar and merciless kill dudes left, right and center mercenary. The character represents everything that used to be considered wrong and immoral to humanity. To sum up Deadpool's focal points, the graphic violence is gut-wrenching all throughout (although some if it is fun), the humor as funny as it can be sometimes is crude and vulgar. Sex is active in this movie, very active. What's more shocking coming from a Catholic perspective is how this is what society calls entertainment. Obviously this film is not geared towards children as anyone opposed to this viewers opinion would say and while that may be true, it is also false. How can anyone say Deadpool isn't geared toward children (the film definitely not) when his costumed appearance is already attractive for them as well as the fact that he is portrayed in cartoon shows and video games already geared toward a younger audience? This film overall represents how ugly we have become as a culture.That isn't to say the film's not without it's good moments. This is the reason for the 5 star rating. The action can be very impressive to see how it was filmed. The humor at certain times is clever and is delivered excellently. There is one character who stands out way more than Deadpool himself and that is the character of Colossus who ironically represents everything that's right in the world trying to remind everyone of morality and being correct, though that isn't explored for much in the film. That being said, with the upcoming sequel about to be released in May, it is clear it will be no different than the originals. Standards are lost in the film industry disappointingly, but there are still several individuals who need to be protected from the lies of the world and that is the most vulnerable: the children. They must be protected from films like this because until the One up above returns, our culture doesn't seem to want to learn this truth."

" One of the best Marvel movies
",0.7906,0.9972,2018-03-28 00:00:00,9,"Deadpool (2016) is an interesting movie, because it's Marvel and all, but it's not at all your typical Marvel hero movie. If you're going into this one thinking it's going to be like Iron Man or Spider Man or something, then you'll be very shocked. It's not really a superhero movie, more like a comedic revenge action movie with some romance mixed in. And the content is also very different, a lot more explicit, R rated. But ya know, that stuff works and fits this one. I really like that this movie ventured out and did that because it fit the tone of the whole thing. Ryan Reynolds was a great fit for the lead character. He delivers all the hilarious lines in his own way, and it just works. I can't think of an actor that would have done a better job with portraying this particular role. The entertainment is so fresh here, from the witty script to the well orchestrated action sequences. All the other cast members are great too, the villain especially. I loved the movie, and I think anyone that's a Marvel fan and doesn't mind edgier content will love it too."

Deadpool has topped one of the top Marvel movies that Fox owns. A very intriguing antagonist, and an origin story that flips in and out of how he became the Merc with a Mouth. We do not have to wait for the Merc with A Mouth to finish up to how he got there. Instead, the fantastic director Tim Miller has given us a chance to interact with the foul-mouthed, fantastically-made anti-hero with his weapons and his mission, but also tells us his backstory as the movie progresses.Overall, fantastic movie, worth to watch over and over and over again!!GO WATCH !!"

" A slick performance
",0.0,0.9941,2018-03-23 00:00:00,7,"7.5
I anticipated finding this a bit of a eye-roller, but I honestly can't find much fault with this other than the fact that it wasn't entirely to my personal taste. It's slick, surprisingly funny, and quite rightly doesn't pull any punches. The casting is good - Reynolds is an excellent lead, and Ed Skrein really makes the best of what is unfortunately a rather dull villain character. The story is occasionally a bit thin, or just misses the mark slightly - possibly owing to the budget constraints, although these seem to have been approached creatively - and there is a tendency to slightly overdo the key elements of fourth-walling, quips, references etc. For my taste, it just missed a little something, but unusually for such a situation, I found myself really appreciating the way the film was put together. Frankly, it's a damn good piece of work, with enough invention to make it fresh without being cringey. It kept me guessing, I didn't look at the time once (always a good sign both of an engaging production and a good length), and I enjoyed myself a lot more than I expected to. Definitely happy to see more."
" love DP
",0.6369,0.9988,2018-03-21 00:00:00,10,"I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future."

There's nothing special with the plot, it bores me to the point I would never touch this sequel (if the producer really stupid to make it a sequel)
I would state it in bold, deadpool is most overhyped movies that succeed attract everyone to go to the movies and disappoint them later (luckily I watch it on fox channel, the only thing I felt sorry is my 1 hour got wasted) The score rating is rigged, the good reviews was liar, don't fall for it guys"

" ""Consistently laugh-out-loud funny""
",0.4404,-0.1098,2018-03-10 00:00:00,8,"If you're considering a trip down to your local multiplex to catch the unlikeliest x-man in all his fourth wall breaking glory, then chances are you know a little about what you're going to get already. From the gloriously silly opening credits, DEADPOOL wants to make one thing clear right off the bat: this is not going to be a shy movie. If they're going to do DEADPOOL, they're going to do it right this time!As is well known by now, the last time they brought the merc with the mouth to the big screen, it was in 2009's abysmal X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, where they took the decision to allow a significant part of his screen time to take place with his mouth sewn shut. This time around there will be no mouth-sewing, instead we get plenty of crude humour, gratuitous violence and all the fourth wall breaking we can handle. This is DEADPOOL the way it should always have been.Wade Wilson (Reynolds) makes the untimely discovery that he is riddled with cancer; it's untimely because he has just met the woman of his dreams. In an act of desperation he agrees to undergo an unorthodox procedure that will supposedly cure him, and as an added bonus he'll get superpowers. As always, with these things, it's not going to be that straightforward. End result: he becomes Deadpool; he's super but he's definitely not a hero, and he has one thing on his mind: revenge against the people that did this to him.DEADPOOL is consistently laugh-out-loud funny. From the witty one-liners to the numerous sight gags with so much more dotted throughout. If you don't mind your humour being a bit silly and more than bit crude then this is one of the funniest you'll have seen in a long time. It's also excessively violent; the censors' decision to go with the 15 certificate in the UK will certainly be raising a few eyebrows.Tonally, DEADPOOL is fairly consistent, the only noticeable exception to this are the scenes inside the facility where Wilson is being 'tested' by the shady people who have brought him there to 'cure' him. It is in these scenes where events take a very dark turn, almost too dark. This humourless sequence sticks out like a sore thumb and threatens to hamper the film momentarily. Fortunately, it's not too long before we're back to the quipping and dick jokes.At a time where the superhero flick could do with maybe taking a step back and easing off the 'taking itself too seriously' pedals, DEADPOOL arrives like a breath of fresh air to a genre that is fast showing signs of being worn. Though, you might want to consider leaving the kids at home for this one."

This experiment has, as a result, the acceleration of his healing powers, and Deadpool is ready. He is ready to fight for everything and firstly for his love with a different way. His dark humor, sexy language, and his new abilities are only a small taste of what this superhero is ready to do and what the results of his actions will be.I have to admit that I laughed a lot at this movie and of course I enjoyed it very much. I can understand that is a Marvel movie which many people were thinking that was made for children and its jokes had to be for kids and not for adults but since this movie is rated with R all these comments are wrong. ""Deadpool"" is a movie for adults, with plenty of violence, bad language, sexy scenes, and nudity and not for children. I liked very much the interpretations of Ryan Reynolds who played as Wade Wilson / Deadpool, Karan Soni who played as Dopinder and Morena Baccarin who played Vanessa. The direction and the selection of cast which was made by Tim Miller were simply amazing and this can be easily understood by the success of this movie.Finally, I have to say that ""Deadpool"" is an amazing movie with a very good cast, a well-written and clever script, good plot and many funny moments - scenes. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you will have a really great time and of course you are going to enjoy it very much.

" You'll be on the edge of your seat
",0.0,0.9971,2018-03-09 00:00:00,9,"Just when you thought that superhero movies could not get any better. From the Hulk to Spider-Man, Marvel has created the country's most well known superheroes, and Deadpool is definitely one to add to the top of your list. Not a Marvel fan? This movie still is the one for you. Deadpool is a parody of the typical and cliche super hero movies. It's about a a middle aged man, Wade Wilson who was diagnosed with cancer. He was in a very serious relationship with his girlfriend, , who influences a lot of decisions he makes, one of them being to get rid of his cancer so he can finally take the next step their relationship without the fear of death clouding her mind. One day, he was offered the chance for him to get better, since the chemotherapy was not cutting it. But, it was a scam, he was tricked into being a human guinea pig. Well, to say the least, he ended up losing all of his charming looks, and looked like he was tossed into a deep frier. Hence the body suit that he never takes off. However, he was given the ability to never die (or it would be very hard to kill him). If he was shot by a bullet, it would just leave a hole through his body and he would later recover. With these powers, he fought against criminals and teamed up with other not-your-typical-superheros.It is impossible to just sit back and enjoy this movie. Every second leaves you either on the edge of your seat or squirming around as you laugh. Yes, this is an R rated movie and does is recommended for an older audience, probably 17+, due to the profanity and sexual references, but I definitely recommend saving this for your kids when they get older. It for sure is a must see. This was unlike any other comedy and action movie I have ever seen, and that is why I recommend it. I am typically not a super hero movie type of person; I just think a lot of them are cheesy, but the fact that the creators decided to create a superhero movie with a dash of comedy is pure genius. That way, it appeals to a wider range of people. So if you want to watch a Marvel movie, that will constantly make you laugh till your stomach hurts, with the perfect amount of love I there, then Deadpool is the movie for you.Whoever claims that Deadpool is pointless, obviously has no sense of humor and is just purely hating on this movie to try to stand out. Yes, there are vulgar words used, but that just adds to the humor. The reason why that they do that because they want to make it relatable to people nowadays. Whether you believe it or not, this is how society and teenagers talk, with the ""f bombs"" and slang. This only just makes the movie more relatable. Also, it is impossible to label Deadpool as boring and pointless because of all the action and fighting scenes. Although Deadpool, like all other superhero movies are unrealistic, the special effects and cinnemotagraphy is so well done that as you walk out of the theatre you feel as if it Wade Wilson is going to come out of nowhere. If you were to break down the plot of this movie, creating the graphics are difficult because of how insane the fighting scenes are. A lot of times, when Wade is shot, it leaves a hole in his body until he wakes up the next day. Through that whole time, you can see directly through his injury, as it matches the background. Also, when Someone shoots a gun, they slow down the OSmall and tedious details like these are hard to account for but Deadpool executed this aspect perfectly.This movie combined love, superheroes, action and comedy all into one movie. How could it get more exciting than that? So, the next time you bored at home, scrolling through the endless movies on Netflix, unsure If you want to watch a rom com or a comedy, pick Deadpool to satisfy all of your ""movie cravings."""
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.9946,2018-03-05 00:00:00,6,"I was in two minds about watching DEADPOOL. On the one hand, I generally enjoy modern-day superhero movies, which are very much all of a kind but have decent special effects and lots of action to see them through. They're easy viewing. On the other hand, I'm no fan of crude humour and bad language, and I knew what to expect with this one. I don't think much of Ryan Reynolds, either. I was pleased to find, then, that I enjoyed DEADPOOL quite a bit. It's not one of my favourite superhero films but as an origin story it does the job nicely and there are lots of memorable quirky moments and characters to enjoy. As a comedy, it's also a lot wittier than I was expected, and I enjoyed picking up all of the pop culture references. The crudeness did nothing for me but most of it was in the form of throaway lines so didn't matter too much. The strong supporting cast features an on-form Ed Skrein and a typically hulking Gina Carano, but Colossus was my favourite 'star' here. The CGI-augmented action scenes are well staged and the action has a nicely brutal edge. To me, this feels like a natural successor to the CRANK films, albeit better made."

If you for some reason haven't seen this movie yet, I'd like to let you know that there is a hilarious end-credit scene worth sticking around for. Action - The action is all well choreographed and fun. All the effects are awesome, and it feels like this movie had a much higher budget than it did. The director knew what he was doing. Comedy - This movie is hilarious. Not a single joke falls flat. A lot of the comedy is fairly violence-based and profane. If you don't like that for some reason, then don't watch it. This movie has pretty much everything that could qualify it for an R rating in it. Plot - Though there are a few cliches featured in this movie (mostly for comedic purposes) this movie is pretty original. Not a lot of movies tell their stories in this manner. If you're interested in watching a boring conventional superhero story, look elsewhere. Cinematography - Looks awesome. Everything is well-shot. Enough said. Characters - Everyone is funny and believable. Basically everything is well done and this movie should be watched by everyone (except maybe young children)."

Now normally, I wouldn't consider myself a fan of Marvel - but along comes this movie, which also inspired me to write a film of my own; combining a women's comedy with this superhero film and its foremost ingredients that make this film so good. Likewise, the opening sequence staggered me with its epic panorama tying into the prologue's big action scene, the satirized opening credits and ""Angel of the Morning"" song that effectively enhanced the mood. I owe it all to Marvel and whoever rhymes with ""Polverine"" for making this film possible. As for the fourth wall breaking? That's like sixteen walls!"
" Everything Wrong with Hollywood in One, Smug, Vulgar, Annoying Package
",-0.6124,-0.9914,2018-02-17 00:00:00,1,"Hollywood has a ton of problems these days. An irrational reliance on big, loud, CGI filled blockbusters, a fixation with TV style digital cinematography, and a compulsion to make movies that are meme-friendly, self-congratulatory, and above all, trendy. This describes the downright depressing point Hollywood has fallen to in the past decade or so. It also describes, to a tee, Deadpool. This subversive superhero movie is a personification of everything today's sardonic millennial moviegoers cherish. It's vulgar, violent, ugly, devious, ironic, and hip. It's one, big meme. Comic book nerds and teenage boys love it. Fine. I hated every second.The problem right away is that Deadpool is a terrible character. He's a joke, but one that is only funny to those who drool over spandex-clad musclemen and collect kids' toys in their free time. I'm talking about nerds. Deadpool is what nerds think ""cool"" is. Played with infuriatingly self-satisfied panache by nerd God Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool is an impeccably sculpted, overtly confident, wise-cracking nerd himself. He can win any self-respecting geek over with a quick reference and hardy, fourth wall breaking high five for those who get it. For those in the know, Deadpool is a naughty wish fulfillment character. The asshole they always wished they could be. To the rest of us, he's just an asshole.Deadpool is among the most unpleasant movies I have ever sat through. I could go a step further and say it is the most unpleasant two hours it could possibly be. Deadpool serves as a shining example of every single thing I hate about movies today. For starters, it's another superhero movie. For all director Tim Miller's insistence that this is a different kind of superhero story, it's really just a typical origin story, peppered with enough F-bombs and sex jokes to make something superficially unique. Secondly, the movie looks dreadful. Digital and grey, just like literally every other movie that has been released since 2010. Is it the current TV-Mania sweeping through the younger generation that is convincing filmmakers to replicate the cheap, washed out look of low budget television? Why else are movies getting worse and worse to look at? Third, and most egregiously, Deadpool is relentlessly full of itself. The script really isn't a script so much as it is a list of jokes, gags, and winks meant only to placate the fans who practically bullied the movie into existence. Deadpool knows its audience will go gaga for its star and his dumb schtick. In fact, they are so confident of their dominion over geekdom that the whole thing reeks of the kind of self-satisfied arrogance of a hack comedian making a dumb crowd go wild.Deadpool is a movie that will make you lose faith in movies. Hell, it made me lose faith in humanity. If this is the kind of thing people will praise as the new gospel, then we as a race are in serious trouble. Deadpool is a bland superhero movie, a vulgar comedy, and a cynical corporate exercise rolled into a rotten chimichanga of the worst impulses of modern Hollywood. It's not technically the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is, in its relentless nastiness, one of the most thoroughly depressing. I got no enjoyment from Deadpool, and it made me question whether I will ever like a movie again.07/100"
" A Hypocritical Albeit Comedic Critique on the Superhero Genre
",-0.0772,0.9712,2018-02-16 00:00:00,5,"Was this really the meta parody that it's cracked up to be? Short answer: no. Deadpool is more of a hypocritical albeit comedic critique on the superhero genre.Don't get me wrong it was a good time; entertaining, funny, true to the source material, and an interesting enough origin story. Ryan Reynolds doesn't do a bad job as his somewhat recurring character and fits the part pretty well. He doesn't seem to always have the best comic timing or ability, but then again some jokes are only so funny when they come from an expressionless cgi head. The comedy at times was spot-on and at other times juvenile and forced. But considering the rapid fire pace of everything in this film you didn't really have time to get discouraged about it. T.J. Miller added even more comic relief but the person who really shone in that department was Leslie Uggams who played Deadpool's blind unlikely roommate. Every moment with the duo on screen was laughable from their exchange of snide remarks and insults or just the general situation.As funny as it was (which is really all it had going for it), in the end Deadpool is just another big-budgeted mindless action-packed explosion full of atrocious cgi. Its really just an R-rated version of what we've already seen. Sure it wasn't another Green Lantern experience but it wasn't a uniquely fresh spin on the genre like something we got with Kick-Ass. A film can't really be considered a parody if it becomes the tropes that it's satirizing. Deadpool is not much different than any other of the numerous superhero films coming out today, it just takes a different path to the same single-minded goal of box office success."

The constant turns-to-camera, pop-culture pilfering jokes and general crudity do become slightly tiresome since they constantly take the place of a varied and interesting plot. Don't get me wrong, it's entertaining, even breathlessly so at times. It's fairly funny fairly consistently and rather exciting on occasion, especially during its standout 'highway' action set-piece - which is sadly ruthlessly segmented. The sense that it panders to the same ideals and structure it lampoons is a strong one, though, and in the end it just can't escape the shadow of the genre it is trying so hard to defy. 7/10"
" Like its hero, rough around the edges but not without its charms
",0.6819,0.995,2018-02-03 00:00:00,7,"Like Marvel films better than some do, have never been and never will be part of this ridiculous MCU vs DCU war, and the positive critical reception drew me in to seeing 'Deadpool'. Having now seen it finally, seeing as audience reaction seemed more divisive (especially here where the dislike is unnecessarily vitriolic) which did put me off watching it for a while, it was a good film if not a great one. It was very entertaining, and credit is due for trying to take more of a comedic edge to a genre that can be taken seriously (sometimes overly so) and for taking risks. At the same, 'Deadpool' is also uneven. 'Deadpool' for me did have its issues. Tonally, it is not always balanced, with too much emphasis on the humour and not enough on the action. Contrary to what others thought, most of the humour was enjoyable but there were jokes and lines that didn't land very well due to taking it too far with the crudeness and childishness (some of the superhero cliché jokes felt very out of date and stale). Other minuses are the overlong length, some repetition, a pretty forgettable villain and a rushed and muddled final act. However, 'Deadpool' is very well made visually. Slick, stylish and brooding with typically well crafted effects. The music is haunting and rousing and most of the direction is very assured and sharp, if at times not always in control of the tonal balances. The action is dynamically choreographed and exciting, and the romantic and emotional elements just about avoid the mawkish sentimentality trap and instead give 'Deadpool' its heart.Most of the humour is very funny, though its extremely black comedic nature has proven to be an acquired taste. As said, that it tried to incorporate humour into an often taken seriously genre was interesting and refreshing, even if there is a try too hard element at times with how it's balanced with everything else. The story is a pretty lightweight one structurally, but the hugely energetic pace and sense of fun elevated it. Ryan Reynolds brings charismatic charisma, vulnerability and great comic timing to the title role, one he was born to play and he successfully allows one to root for his character. All the cast do a more than serviceable job, Morena Baccarin coming over the most confidently. In summary, good film if not great. Rough around the edges but not without its charm, like the titular character hero himself. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

During the promo campaign, the adaptation of Deadpool was positioned as strictly corresponding to the tonality of the canon, and the creators of the film were especially proud of the work permit they received from the rating. However, the potentially possible demonstration of violence, sex, etc., was updated as a set close-ups of the protagonist's ass and utterly far-fetched jokes.The controversy over whether the format of comic books belongs to the field of art, or is nothing more than a kind of entertainment for dreamy teens, was decided at a time when a subculture called ""geeks"" proved its originality and consistency with respect to the cultural sphere. And the hand-drawn original of ""Deadpool"" is a very worthy example of this genre, which can not be said about the film. Cinema version does not even solve an elementary problem on the representation of the hero, besides not adding to the totality of its characteristics nothing new. Deadpool swears and moves with plastic that makes you think about his sexual orientation - nothing more happens on the screen.Despite numerous conversations and suggestions, the creators of ""Deadpool"" did not dare to make the central character gay, which would be, although not so original for Marvel's paintings (it is only necessary to recall Sebastian Stan and his interview on ""love story""), but would allow, based on the rules of good taste, not to include ""Deadpool"" to the frank thrash, which he is, declaring R, but focusing on the interests of a limited virgin teenager, for whom the phrase ""anal sex"" is something incredibly intriguing - on level entertainment famous hero of Oscar Wilde in the interpretation of the series ""Horror on the cheap"", and automatically raises the ""Deadpool"" in the rank of cult films.Aggressive marketing and thematic entries in the social accounts of the starring role of Ryan Reynolds, trying for the second time to try on a superhero costume after an unfortunate Green Lantern, preceded an hour and a half story without culmination, with a string in the second half of the timing and the fundamental lack of both dramaturgy and director style . The debutant in the full meter Tim Miller apparently pretend to the laurels of Matthew Vaughn, trying to combine a serious subtext and colorful, full of specials. effects the embodiment of the selected story on the screen. But the result of the efforts seems to be exclusively cinematographically faceless (even the most fanatical lover of collages and artifices will hardly find in Deadpool at least a few frames ready to serve as a base for visual creativity) a product in which the director is a man whose role is to be found next to monitor during filming, but not to professional ingenuity and creativity.Writers from the team wrote those several notebooks, which served as the literary basis for the franchise ""G.I. Joe "", do not justify the director-artisan, but only emphasize the problems of staging and the lack of camera work, filling"" Deadpool ""with jokes about sex, asses, limbs and vaginas, hardly able to cause even a shadow of grin among the potential age audience admitted to the cinema for a session , marked with the letter R. That is, the level of the humorous component of ""Deadpool"" is not just approaching, but completely coincides with what was shown in the famous scene of the satirical comedy ""Idiokratiya"", where the audience laughed and came to ecstasy, that on the screen to him without any comments demonstrated causal places.In other words, while the Rousseau brothers and Zach Snyder are sophisticated and, I must say, do this very successfully, trying to cover up the extremely brutal scenes of the Civil War and the Dawn of Justice with the letters PG-13, Tim Miller and his team use the opposite strategy. ""Deadpool"" is nothing more than a compilation of a number of sketches, with a lot of questions computer graphics"

Not since Dredd has there been a comic book film which is for adults instead of the repeititive fare we are getting elsewhere.Deadpool is superhero who denies being one, and is totally unorthodox. Shunning all the morality of the standard hero, his name is known, he takes off his mask, he kills villians without remorse, he swears and break's the screens fourth wall. All with a cheeky and crude motormouth, this is a loveable rogue of an action hero.The action is violent but I really liked it, and really makes fun of the whole genre with quips all the way through. We have a bit of an origins story here to give us some background to the character, whom I never knew about before. He is simply the antithesis of the average comic book hero, and all the better for it here.Give it a try if you are ready for a bout of adult humour & violent comic fare. I was, and I liked it.

",0.75,0.9993,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Deadpool' is this year's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - a non-mainstream Marvel film with offbeat humour that's really well made. And the soundtrack's good, but not as excellent as the aforementioned film. Deadpool's story is a simple one, really - mostly because it's pretty much identical to Wolverine's origin story: ex-soldier thinks he's not a hero, even though he helps others, gets experimented on and turned into a freak, tries to win back his loved one. That being said - this is much better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', and even 'The Wolverine'. Still, there's a few throwbacks to the former, which featured Reynolds as a non-masked Deadpool, and a few nice winks to Hugh Jackman.The film starts excellently, with a fantastic super slow-motion shot, and has the funniest titles sequence I think I've ever seen. The film then does a good job of flashing back to fill us in on how Wade Wilson (Reynolds) became Deadpool - helped by some appropriate fourth-wall breaking. We're introduced to Vanessa (Baccarin - who looks a lot like Famke Janssen from the original 'X-Men'), the love of his life, and Weasel (Miller) his best friend. They both play good supporting parts, particularly some of Miller's lines which are dryly hilarious. It's also good to see Marvel try to take back some of their X-Men characters from Fox (which is acknowledged with tongue in cheek), with Colossus (Kapicic) being portrayed excellently - a naive Russian with a pure heart, trying to get Deadpool to join the X-Men. He's helped by the new character, Negasonic (Hildebrand) - and the taxi-driver (Soni) in two great scenes.The bad guys, Francis (Skrein) & Angel (Carano), are adequate and move the plot along. The ending's good and I hope they make more, because the fight scenes are done excellently, the humour and jokes are 100% adult-only and totally fitting. Reynolds nails it as the 'Merc with a mouth', with great timing and nuance from under his mask, and he does a great job of not being the pretty-boy when needed. This film makes me hope they get around to doing a Gambit film at some stage - and I'm now interested to see how 'Doctor Strange' turns out later in the year..."

Reynolds is having the time of his life as Wade Wilson, wise-cracking the entire time and taking swipes at himself, the X-Men series and Hugh Jackman.The story follows Wilson, hellbent on revenge after inheriting mutant abilities by the sadistic Francis, played by Ed Skrein. Deadpool goes on a manhunt to take out Francis and save his partner, having been kidnapped by the former. Acquainted with Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who are dubious about Deadpool's actions, they face Francis and it's fairly self-explanatory from there.Despite technically being part of the X-Men series, this film is much more crass, vulgar and humorous, and that's part of the charm.

The quick summery for the movie is that he finds out that he has cancer and doesn't have much more to live. So he is visited by this stranger who says that he might be able to cure his cancer. So nothing much to lose he accepts his offer and goes with him. They do a all kinds experiments on him and put him trough a lot of pain. He sees that it was a bad idea and tries to escape. He then goes trough a near death experience and gains his super power that is regeneration so that the cancer will never kill him. But after all those experiments he is left deformed. He then goes on to take revenge on the man that did this to him. And of course like any other super hero movie he finds the man and kills him. I think that the movies strongest points are the comedic scenes. It might be just me but the comedy makes the movie what it is. There might be a few cheesy moments that are just bad but that's what the movie is all about. This is one of my favorite movies so far in the later years and i'm already very hyped about the next movie that comes out in a few years.

Jesus Christ get over yourself and stop taking life so seriously. While scrolling through I even saw someone who was a fan of the x films say he hated collossus in this movie. It must of been because this one was true to the comics and not the same guy from the TRASH!!! Xmen movies. If you love X-Men and you've been disappointed with everything from the last stand to Apocalypse, this movie is probably up your alley. Oh and you should probably check out Logan too cause that movie is amazing."

The movie is for the grown- ups, and they made sure all the fun was in there. Ryan Reynolds got a breakthrough role here. He is definitely the cool guy not for the bad guys want to be around. The actress is great too. Beautiful as she is, she can be a naughty, and it was a great joy to watch. She and Reynold had such good chemistry together. The movie is fast pace and the action scenes are great. This superhero definitely deserves a sequel."

" Basic Review- Some Spoilers
",0.0,0.9576,2017-10-10 00:00:00,10,"The actor who plays Deadpool or Wade Wilson, Ryan Reynolds, was a very good choice. He did a great job portraying the character. Using his ever expanding arsenal of delicious snark. An operative turned, mercenary, turned cancer patient, turned medical experiment, then turned Deadpool, constantly and only thinking about revenge to the one who ""cured"" him. With his character talking directly to us it makes us a part of the movie. Throughout the movie you see many different types of camera and lighting shot to set the mood of that scene. During the time that they are shooting the scene when he is in the medical office, they are using low level lighting. At the end when they are shooting the main fight scene at the end of the movie they are using a high level lighting. The lighting is another very helpful tool to set the various moods and different type of scene throughout the movie. When they use the different camera angles, like in the beginning they use the close up, this is the first time we see this. Later in the movie you see the technique like when he's in the cab . The close up angle is used to portray a mood of seriousness. This movie was a very good movie and I'm am looking forward to the second movie coming out in 2018. If the second movie is as good as the first one then that will make one great movie sequence."
" One of two ways modern comicbook-based movies *should* go
",0.0,0.987,2017-10-01 00:00:00,7,"Review by someone who is not a comic book fan.Deadpool is really funny and it is really meta-. It is not just meta- it is meta-meta; like the titular character says at one point, it doesn't just break the proverbial fourth wall, but a wall within that wall.Deadpool is also silly and it is fully aware of that silliness. It is written to feel like every choice in the script that remains faithful to comic book hero conventions is a fully conscious and somewhat ironic one.That said, there's still a decent plot (barring the pretty basic/unremarkable bad guy) and, somehow, we can still feel for the main characters and root for their romance.Coming back to my review title: I think this is a comic book adaptation done right. It's inventive, non-generic, and non-boring. With such an abundance of blockbuster adaptations nowadays, it's really hard to find one that stands out and doesn't just follow a recipe and the beaten path. It's even harder to find one that will appeal to an audience that likes cinema without being particularly interested in comic books and would like to see something more substantial than a generic action movie. I think the purely comedic and ironic take of Deadpool manages all that. I also think it's the only option to making great comic book adaptations, other than the gritty, dark, and realistic style that works so well in ""Logan""."
" The unbearable atrocity of the being
",0.0,0.9828,2017-09-28 00:00:00,1,"For years I've been following IMDb as my movie guide. But never until tonight I ever registered on the site. This movie made me do it and still write my first review ever of a movie. Congrats, Deadpool, for that! I do not have the ambition or boldness to talk about technical aspects of film making, as many reviews I read so far, as I admit not having the knowledge to do so. I just love cinema, both clever movies which makes you think for long time after you watched it, and those pure entertaining popcorn light stuff which makes you spend a couple of hours alienated from the real world. This film matches none of the above. A non existing plot makes you think why there's nothing to think about. An embarrassing mess of characters, action, sex and humour makes you feel like standing up and stop the agony after the first 10 minutes. It was one of the very few occasions I seriously had to make a huge effort to watch this Deadpool until the end. The reason why I did it was because I kept a naïve hope Deadpool's girl would end up dead or (dream of the dreams) Deadpool would die himself for good. And I do like happy endings ... Superheros are in fashion. Marvel is on fire. The industry sucks this resource until its exhaustion, as always. And that's why you have good stuff, reasonable stuff and bad stuff. Sometimes they come up with pure trash because they know some brains will still enjoy it. Deadpool is a fine example of that. The worse is they tried to look creative, original and defying. Arrogance! They ended up making the comic character look ridiculous and the whole piece as dumb as an ostrich. The humour is atrocious, cheap and vulgar. The attempt to make fun of itself embarrassing. Humour is much more than we saw here. This can fit on something rather comic. And bad comic! Producing comedy nowadays looks like making fast food. Take and go!. But Humour is not for everyone and specially not for those who can't see they have no talent for it. Laughing on Deadpool is for children's minds (up to 12 years old max!) or IQ's below 70. Resuming, this is an insult to the Xmen saga. Futile, hollow and arrogant. The sequel is on the way so be careful!"
" Garbage that panders to the lowest common denominator.
",-0.3818,0.9902,2017-09-28 00:00:00,1,"I first saw this movie with the highest of expectations. I quickly realized that I had placed an overabundance of faith in my friends and relatives opinions of a movie. Not only did my opinions of Deadpool quickly change from a 8/10 to a 1/10, but my opinion of my friends and relatives was brought to the same lows. I truly love comic books and have always been a massive fan of both marvel and DC, but after seeing this movie, I have had to take a step back and reconsider not only the genre, but my faith in other people. If people truly believe this movie to be anything above a 1/10 or anything other than a complete disaster that clearly was designed for teenage boys or 30 year olds that still live with their parents and spend the entirety of their ""allowance"" on video games and snacks. I would love to have anything positive to say about this movie, but if I said anything nice Tha. This or gave a review any higher, I would be lying."
" Dying with laughter
",0.4939,0.9931,2017-09-27 00:00:00,10,"OK so I think most us can agree the way that Ryan Reynolds plays any character is brilliant and sunny no matter what he does. Ryan Reynolds was casted perfectly for this role and I cant wait for Deadpool 2 to come out next year. The only annoying thing about this film is the rating attached to it. Unfortunately I wasn't able to go and see it in the cinema so I had to instead wait until it came out on DVD to see it and I can honestly day that I was not disappointed with it. I was laughing the entire way through the film. Partially because of the pure comedy and satire of the film but also because some of it is somewhat relatable to. Deadpool in my mind has been a pretty underrated Marvel character and now he finally has his own movie!!! I did think it was pretty late to bring out a film about him as in the comics he has actually killed every character in the marvel universe including the writers themselves. However this was a fun short story that Marvel produced, but one the less. Back to the film though, it was amazing in every aspect, both action and comedy it was equally balanced and the casting for each and every member was perfectly picked, I have already watched this at least two times.

" Adult type Superhero film that kicksass
",0.0,0.9981,2017-09-22 00:00:00,7,"Here's an inventively original super hero comedy, unfortunately not one for kiddies. I expected laughs all through, but was sold short on that, where instead, they come in durations, and ones of some pretty hysterical s..t, but too, it's very smart humor, thanks to lines from a screenwriter, you have to envy, because they're that good. From the opening credits, of originality, you have to admire, played against an 80's track, you do not expect, and the opening scene, you've got one loud, clever superhero flick, with some gruesome moments, mind you, as revengeful Reynolds, now donning a bland Spiderman looking costume, is after the badarse Skein ( who makes a great English villain, topping Reynold's performance easily) who horribly disfigured his beautiful baby face, where he's wears the congressional medal of ugly, where that big guy from Fantastic Four doesn't look that bad. That's sheer motive, to go after and kill his guy. The movie starts, half point of story, which is clever, where we rewind, to find out Reynold's life, prefore, to his little misfortune, where he was a kind of secret vigilante, working for an secret agency. He has a hot girlfriend, but his health's not that good. I was pretty happy from what Deadpool delivered, better on a second watch. It was just the laugh factor, that let me down. It's a smartly original film, where Reynolds, who like Charlie Sheen, has great comic timing, and I did like the way he played it, despite not being Oscar attraction. The girlfriend, but it's Skein you'll remember. The young superhero girl, who with Reynold's old protégé, a big monstrous Fantastic 4 figure, helps him dispose of this evil, looks like that creepy hate driven girl in The Crush. There's a nice V.O after note that ends this ambitious piece of film making too. A must see, again, not for the kiddies."

People reviewing it 1 star out of 10 are acting like this movie kicked their dog into speeding traffic. Y'all need to lighten up.The world could use more rated R super hero movies like Logan and Deadpool. Movies that aren't afraid to show the gritty side of anti-heroes. I've watched many interviews and heard from many people online that they think that this movie sticks very closely to it's source material, so those people complaining about the humor in the movie are probably just really complaining about a highly popular and established Marvel Comic.9 out of 10, easy."
" A Love Letter to Ryan Reynolds From Ryan Reynolds
",0.6369,-0.9267,2017-09-21 00:00:00,1,"I do not honestly see what is to like about this movie. As a comic book fan and open to the occasional comic-based movie, I was absolutely disgusted with this one. I do not understand how this tired film even was considered for the Golden Globes. It just boggles my mind entirely. Granted Ryan Reynolds is supposed to be comedy relief in most of his movies, he failed to come up to that level in this one. When I was forced to watch this by my older brother, he loved it...as did his own 13-year-old daughter. For the record, with the amount of strong language and violence in this movie (and I usually have no problem with violence or language in a movie, particularly R-rated ones), I wouldn't have allowed her to see it even with parental supervision.The way I see it, Ryan was just phoning it in on this one. I am partial to the occasional breaking of the fourth wall with an actor/actress addressing the audience, but this was absolutely ridiculous. If he wasn't in literally every single scene, he was addressing the audience. There were so many inappropriate jokes in here (even for my liking) that it would have driven a high school boy into a frenzy. And let's not forget the channeling of Ferris Bueller in the very end. That was entirely unnecessary. I had such a hard time watching this movie that it was amazing that I did. Probably the best word to describe this waste is ""juvenile,"" if that much. It was the worst two hours of my life that I can't get back. I have seen many comic-based movies in my time, but this one was probably the worst. Do not sit down and watch this. You will get a headache and/or feel nauseous."
" Different in a good way
",0.4404,0.9989,2017-09-20 00:00:00,8,"Deadpool is a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by generic, boring Marvel movies. Not all MCU movies are this way but there are a few that follow the same generic pattern like Ant Man, Thor the dark world and Doctor Strange. Of course the film takes place outside of the MCU and is coupled with the X-men movies made with 20th century fox who are not afraid to go out of their comfort zone. Sometimes it does not work, like in X-men age of apocalypse, but the nicest thing about this movie is it takes risks and succeeds. Is this film a masterpiece..NO however it was thoroughly enjoyable and went where not many comic book movies go. People die in this film and Deadpool does a lot of the killing without remorse and adding in some really funny lines that flow easily. Most of the jokes in this film make sense and add an air of comedy to the situation. However some jokes were not funny, in my opinion, like the ""brown pants"" joke which falls short.Anyway the plot! Plot wise this film is simple, Wade Wilson (Deadpool) falls for a hooker, gets cancer, tries to save himself with experiments which give him a fast healing factor curing him but leaving him disfigured. He goes after the guy who did this and ultimately kills him and saves his girlfriend in the process. Nothing more to it.Simple plots are sometimes a great thing as they allow for characters to be introduced and interact in interesting and fun ways. Deadpool is shown to the world as a wise cracking, violent, forth wall breaking anti-hero and that is just what the audience want to see. The fact that none of these characters come to any realisation or develop is half the charm of the actual movie. In generic Marvel movies the character does develop in lame ways by either learning a new skill or learning to work together as a team something along those lines. This film has none of that and instead we are treated to nearly 2 hours of gags and violence. Honestly in this movie it is not a bad thing to have that as it is a unique experience and a break from the norm.Anyway onto the characters and the actors who play them. Ryan Reynolds does a great job as Deadpool. He is very charismatic, funny and acts the part of Deadpool. Like we can say Hugh Jackman IS wolverine we can also say that Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. In my opinion they could not have picked a better actor to play him. He just fits the idea of what most people think Deadpool should sound like and act like so well done Ryan.Ajax or Francis is a boring bad guy. His major thing is that he hates being called Francis for some reason?? It really triggers him as well which I found a bit retarded. Most villains are wronged in some way or have a traumatic experience. Ajax has none of these things and is a bit of a boring character to watch as he just fits the ""British bad guy"" stereotype. If we take a villain like Loki or Magneto we see that really Ajax it not a very competent villain. His henchwoman that he hangs with is boring too and doesn't say any lines of interest. She is only in the film as muscle.The X-men are characters that work well in this film however they are the most stereotypical ""good guys"" in a marvel inspired movie to date. This is not really a thing that destroys the movie or takes you out of things however I found their lack of depth a bit disappointing considering colossus can be a really interesting character if done right. If fact to say that most characters, in this film, stick to a stereotype would be a true enough statement.From a technical side the CGI is done really well and even the CG blood is done tastefully. The music is all popular songs instead of score and brings a sense of fun and playfulness to each scene, especially the violent scenes. The camera work on this film is pretty average for a superhero movie. However I do like the bits where the camera being there is used to break the forth wall and provide a bit of comedy to the scene.This film is great. I just wish it had a better villain and a little bit of depth to the supporting characters, not just Deadpool. However I would advise seeing it and hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Just the nods to other comic films and the Easter eggs in the film will be enough to satisfy the Marvel fan boys. The funny jokes and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool will be enough to satisfy everyone else."

I mean, really really stupid and really really tasteless. Why be so grotesque really? Maybe the character from the book was just like this. There is being funny and swearing and being funny doing it.

Just look at any other Marvel movie out there and you'll find no movie as good as this one (except for the Dark Knight). Granted it has the same plot as many other movies, revenge quest, saving your girlfriend, bla bla bla. The comedy, the constant fourth wall breaking, trashing other Marvel movies for their mistakes especially Ryan Reynolds previous performance as the Green Lantern, and of course Deadpool's characteristics that makes the whole movie so epic. Deadpool delivers a movie unlike any Marvel movie made before."

I'm literally on the verge of giving up watching anything anymore that is deemed as a comedy. What's funny about someone running around with mindless violence, looking like a burns victim. Best person in it was the taxi driver. Oh and here's a thing ... since when does cancer belong in a comedy.Don't bother wasting your time with this pap!

It was supposed to be funny and cute but the jokes were juvenile and aimed at 12 year old boys. I don't know how anyone could laugh at it. 99% of the jokes were dick jokes and they weren't even good ones. Aside from that, the plot was weak and so was the actual character of Deadpool. He was uninteresting and it was impossible to empathize with him or care about him at all. In fact, I found him to be more annoying than anything. The only part that was kindaaaa interesting was when he was being tortured but even that is a stretch. Honestly, if you haven't seen it yet, don't bother, unless you have a terrible taste in movies I guess. I can't understand why everyone LOVES this movie. It's annoying and not worth your time."

Actually, this was probably the superhero that I knew the less, I didn't know exactly what his powers were or how was he created, but with all the (amazing) advertising for this film, I got excited ... I did some research before watching this movie, I went prepared and I have to say: I loved every single second! It was great, I got home and wanted to know everything about this character!The fact that this movie was released in February was already something different and unusual. It's perfectly aware of the enormous amount of superhero movies that we're getting, every couple of months we have a new superhero movie and, even if it's awesome to see our childhood heroes on the screen, the scripts start to be very similar and it can become unexciting.Deadpool's script is, by far, the best attribute of this movie. People come out of the theaters and they're all excited about all the action and how cool the fight scenes were (like in all of the superhero movies nowadays), but the script is phenomenal! It's super funny, rude, sarcastic and they didn't back off ... They had no problems saying things that we usually only think of and never say it out loud.They constantly break the fourth wall to remind us of the state that films are in today and that's brilliant. I love when Deadpool makes fun of his sewn mouth in the X-Men movie or of Ryan Reynolds failures throughout his career. He even makes fun of actors or movies that aren't from comic books, it's just awesome! Also, the opening credits scene it's amazing, one of the best this year for sure!Tim Miller's directing is pretty great: the movie is fast-paced, the action is well shot, without shaky-cam, and the CGI is perfectly used, especially with the character Colossus. Everything looks clear and fluid (few cuts), which proves that you don't need an enormous budget to make a really great-looking film.The only thing that could have destroyed this movie was, like most of the time, the love story. It could have been just a plot device, so Deadpool could save the love of his life, or it could make us not care that much about the relationship and Vanessa ... However, they handle this story like they handle the rest of the film, with sarcasm and rudeness, and that made this story so much better and entertaining.The acting is great, the soundtrack is amazing, the film was incredibly hilarious and Ryan Reynolds was born to portrait this character! Ed Skrein, who plays the villain in this movie, could have done something more to be more interesting, but he works well for the movie's plot and as Deadpool's revenge target, which was what this film needed him to be.Is this movie going to be nominated for a bunch of Oscars? No. Is it a cinematic masterpiece? No. Is it the perfect Deadpool movie? For sure!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"

And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV."

I am absolutely sure that the cinema is over. The fact that a masterpiece is created from time to time does not mean anything, because the masterpiece does not win the billions, and they are lucrative like this. Despite some really successful hits, I can not understand how this movie won so much audience and so much money. I repeat, the cinema is over.

This is why I thought getting a Deadpool movie franchise started would be difficult. To faithfully represent the character, surely the fact that his origins are hazy, to say the least, should be touched upon? But, I suppose, coming up with a definitive origin story was a must, so I can forgive that. Everything else about the movie is as good as I thought it would be.

So is it as good as you've heard? In spite of a few reservations... yes, it largely is. Right off the bat, Ryan Reynolds is the key to its success. His performance is a perfect match for the character of Deadpool, and is among the best portrayals of a comic book character on screen of all time. It's easy to see why he got a Golden Globe nomination. Still, not everything works. There's a little too much time spent on the origin story, and the villains are too weak. You get the impression that they're meant to be parodies of generic movie villains, but there's nothing particularly memorable about them, save for a few good scenes. This leads to a finale that isn't quite as subversive or clever as the rest of the film. Now, back to the positives. The action is stylish, particularly in the opening scene, and the jokes are mostly hilarious. Sure, some of them are a little crude, but whether it's breaking the fourth wall or poking fun at past X-Men movies, the gags Land more often than not. Overall, in spite of some shortcomings, Deadpool is a blast for comic book fans, and Ryan Reynolds is perfect as the title character. Looking forward to Deadpool 2!"

So ""Dr.Francis"" decides to kidnap Deadpools old girlfriend to make Deadpool come to him? .. But Deadpool is already after him so the girlfriend has no place in this story. It's not like they threaten Deadpool with ""If you show your face here we will kill your girlfriend"".Nope, the story SUCKED!"
" A gamechanger for superheroes movies made for adult audiences.
",0.0,0.7165,2017-07-01 00:00:00,10,"When was the last time you enjoyed watching an R rated superhero movie? If you're thinking a movie like the Blade series, you're right. Now here comes Deadpool, a movie based on a character in the X-Men film franchise that made its debut in the horrible X-Men Origins: Wolverine (played by Ryan Reynolds) and now has his own franchise movie. Kids wouldn't like this movie since it has crude jokes, excessive violence, some nudity, and lots of bad language. For adults, they will love this movie. It feels more like a comedy than an action movie, and it shows. I missed it in the theaters when it was a big hit and finally saw it on digital HD as well as numerous times on HBO and bluray. This movie saved Ryan Reynolds' career after his dismal performance in Green Lantern. This movie is to Marvel/Fox what Wonder Woman is to the DCEU: a huge improvement."
" best deadpool movie to date Ha
",0.765,-0.9014,2017-06-27 00:00:00,9,"a great movie i had no clue who dead pool was until i seen a poster of him on a bus, and I'm like what the hell is that spider man's brother. i always find superhero movies to be boring not enough action and their code not to kill. Then dead pool arrives turning enemies inside out blood and core and profanity the anti hero society needs.Typo rules cause me to space out some words. I would of like to see dead pools team he has in the comic books."
" this is zero stars
",0.0,-0.8004,2017-06-22 00:00:00,1,"I have to say that this movie is one of the worse out there. It is zero stars for me. I am a fan of xmen and the marvel universe.I have seen all the movies, so I decided to watch this one based on the 8 star review from the IMDb. The reason I was avoiding it is because I really did not like the character as it was presented in wolverine origins ( a film I really enjoyed watching). The character should remain dead because he was awful. Not only they did not leave him there dead, they decided to make a movie about him.This movie is supposed to be special because he is an 'anti- hero'. Who cares? Of course the movie is special because it is absolutely garbage. No one should watch it. I can not even explain how awful it is. How on earth this movie got 8 stars? I think the reviews are paid reviews. It does not make any sense. I could not watch it until the end because it was hard for me. Please don't watch it."
" A new landmark for superhero and comedy films
",0.4215,0.7269,2017-06-10 00:00:00,9,"With a brilliant script, visceral action, and a Oscar-worthy performance by lead Ryan Reynolds, 2016's Deadpool takes superhero and comedy films into a new direction and proves that comic book movies still have a lot more to offer.Proof of the benefits of filmmakers taking risks rather than following the working formula, Deadpool takes the superhero genre and heightens it with its unapologetic offensive humor, bloody and intense violence, as well as a excellent cast and script. Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole."
" Excrement
",0.0,-0.5763,2017-06-09 00:00:00,1,"So I'm pushing 50 years old. I ask my 21 year old co-worker what he thought of this film. I'm glad it's not just my age group that thinks this ""movie"" is pure garbage.Listen, if you have to use the ""F"" bomb in every sentence, then you probably don't have an original thought of your own, and ZERO creativity. And if you have to inject genital jokes and sexual innuendo into every scene, you border on disgusting and lacking total taste and class.The saddest part of this whole film is that I actually went about an hour into it before I turned it off. Ryan Reynolds should be ashamed of himself honestly. I've lost complete respect for him as an actor, and as a person. There is no justifiable reason for reading this script and then accepting the role, unless of course he's desperate.Good movies don't need profanity, and constant sexual innuendo to be good. This can't even be considered a ""movie"", but total crap."
" Defend the 10 again
",0.0,0.9884,2017-06-07 00:00:00,10,"I've said it in other reviews that no movie is perfect. There aren't any movies that actually deserve a perfect score. But what if you were a dead pool fan and you heard that an actor that was a huge fan too, and had already played the character once with horrible results wished for redemption? What if you wanted a comic book movie that would rise above the whole PG-13 cesspool far too many movies are thrown into these days? What character would be completely drowned in such a pool? Wolverine somehow treads that water even with a metal skeleton, though he did finally get unleashed with an R rated send off film (possibly partly thanks to this movie). But Deadpool could never have been done right in a PG-13 movie. The Merc with the Mouth had to have his lips sowed shut the first go round and after that... well... most fans would say he was never truly Deadpool. Including the man who played him.Ryan Reynolds deserves significant praise for his persistent pursuit of playing a real Deadpool. And boy does he. The R rating took the comic book genre to a sparkly place I wish it would have gone to years ago. Oh yeah is this movie satisfying for that alone and Reynolds nails it. Possibly thanks to the fact that he actually cared.But how good is it as a movie aside from all that? Well, I gave it a ten. It might be more of a nine out of ten movie if it wasn't so special. It was the first R rated movie of its kind and it proved to the people, and the studios, that it could be extremely successful even with that rating. Thank you Deadpool. You deserve an extra star for that alone."
" Don't Fall for the Hype
",0.0,0.9019,2017-06-03 00:00:00,2,"This film serves as a perfect testimony to just how far the current superhero obsession has run amok into completely asinine territory. Deadpool is arguably the most despicable character ever to have been passed off as a hero. Aside from this fact, all of the hoopla from the fan boys saying that this was an edgy film couldn't be more wrong. Throwing vulgar language into the dialogue doesn't make for an edgy film, but it does make for a film that is a phony try-hard. At the end of the day, this film follows the exact same formula as any other contrived superhero film, regardless of what the hype surrounding it might say. This level of self-congratulation attempting to pass itself off as clever is offensive to any viewer who is smart enough to see what's going on. Don't fall for it. This film isn't nearly as smart or witty as it thinks it is."
" I still think it's overrated
",0.0,0.8994,2017-05-22 00:00:00,7,"It will probably be the most unpopular opinion from me but it's the most honest. My introduction to deadpool happened in the early 90's when I was looking through the X-Men action figures at a Wal-Mart and saw the character for the first time. It looked cool but I dismissed him as another generic character that looked less like an X-Men and more a GI Joe villain that would probably lose to snake eyes. That was then and now he has his own film and I still don't understand the appeal. I like the style and the gore factor, I even chuckled at some of the jokes of the film. When it comes down to the movie itself, I just couldn't get into the character of Wade Wilson. I thought he was annoying and loud throughout the whole thing, I didn't see anything unique about the fourth wall break as it's been done to death and better in films such as Fight Club and Ferris Buellers day off. The insane world created for the film is more appropriate for a Japanese anime on a sugary high. The villains are just there for deadpool to have an excuse to kill and the people he interacted with have more to say than our titular hero. I felt like I was watching a superhero film directed by a guy that wanted to impress Quentin Tarantino after watching Kill Bill for the first time but didn't realize he was better off watching Shogun Assassin instead. I don't necessarily think it's a bad movie, I think it's a funny romp on the superhero genre but should've focused more on the satire than making penis jokes and references no one understands.Deadpool is unique but is not as smart as it wants the audience to think it is. This is Ryan Reynolds saving grace after so many failures and stinkers at the box office, one comes to think will this film series be the only thing that will keep him from making straight to video or put him in obscurity? I'll admit I enjoyed the elements of it but that's just it, there are only elements to enjoy as the rest of the movie is a loud MTV film with too many bells and whistles and not enough meat. If you want a good laugh, stick to the naked gun series. If you want carnage and blood, stick to the best of 80's action.I give it a 7 out of 10. It works when it has to despite it's annoying character."

" Not your average superhero
",0.0,0.9682,2017-05-15 00:00:00,9,"For those who are familiar with the character Deadpool, this film does him justice. For those new to the character and his story, you're in for a treat. Needless to say, I was excited about seeing this movie for the first time. As a character, Deadpool is the embodiment of comedy, parody, and slapstick while still delivering a satisfactory level of gore and mayhem. Ryan Reynolds gave his character a new, refreshed life which was much needed after his unfortunate and painfully inaccurate portrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. If you love the action-packed Marvel universe but also crave a healthy dose of humor and a surprising amount of heart, then search no more. This film satisfies on so many levels and the laughs will keep you coming for more, time and again."
" Crude and violent but also a lot of fun
",0.1655,0.9894,2017-05-15 00:00:00,9,"This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'."

" Way too violent, offensive brutal action movie and overrated
",-0.9001,-0.9971,2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"*SOME SPOILERS* What can I say this MARVEL movie is way too violent, way too offensive and really brutal action movie rated-R it is not for kids. The movie has really strong language, they are making fun of the movies and they are joke about it, has a lot sexual scenes and it is just not kind of my movie. I can't say it is a bad movie or it sucks it is just not my couple of tea, maybe I am going to change my opinion some day who knows. It think it is honestly one of the worst superhero movies and I just think it is way too overrated and over-hyped. I mean I don't hate the movie but I don't like it either. I never read the comic books of Deadpool I know Ryan Reynolds Deadpool from X-Men Origins: Wolverine and that is it. I am not fan of Deadpool and I never will be. NOTE Important for kids: The kids should really stay away from this film it is not a superhero it is more a real cold brutal violent action movie. You have a torture in here and Deadpool hurts people the villains really uses people as their lab rats and mutation it is gross. In my opinion it is an insult to MARVEL fan and young little kids. Deadpool doesn't save anyone he is a selfish asshole! Ant-Man is miles way better movie than Deadpool I enjoy that movie more it has a heart and it has a redemption this movie has really nothing that I have found enjoyable.The film copy's scenes from Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Men In Black, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Daredevil. It starts well and then by the first hour goes down hill I hated sex scenes, I hated Ryan Reynolds character joking trough whole film and pointing guns on people I don't like Deadpool killing bad guys, I don't like the bad mouth language the swearing words I don't like it. Too much CGI of gory death scenes, I don't believe the fight scenes are good. I don't understand the plot like what was Ajax doing in some faculty torturing sick people? The movie is terrible to me.I never heard about Negasonic Teenage Warhead she was never mentioned in X-Men movies and where are other X-Men members? they are not in here. Ryan Reynolds is also quoting lines from different movies.Only three things I did like in the movie are: The song playing in then opening scene from Juice Newton - Angel of the Morning it is a good song they could have used in the end of credits but they didn't. The only good thing about this movie is Ryan Reynolds the only positive thing I think he does a solid performance and excellent job the rest of the actors are meh and a huge pile of s**t!Wade Wilson got diagnosed with brain cancer that was serious and we see how hard and rough his life is going. That wasn't a joke my uncle was really diagnosed with cancer and he died 8. months later so that was really portrayed.That's all I like there is nothing much too talk about this movie the ranting I am giving a D 4/10 I am speechless.The MARVEL movies I more enjoy than this movie: Captain America Trilogy (First Avenger, The Winter Soldier and Civil War), Ant-Man, miles way better movie than Deadpool, The Punisher with Thomas Jane in the role, The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 1,3 and Spider-Man 2, Daredevil I still have to re watch, Blade 1,2 and even Blade: Trinity with Ryan Reynolds in it I enjoy more than this movie.I enjoy action movies who are better to me than Deadpool: Rambo films,( Rambo IV is brutal but is way better action movie than Deadpool), Demolition Man, Cobra, Tango & Cash, Cliffhanger, Assassins, Hard Target, Hard Boiled, Broken Arrow, The Killer, The Last Boy Scout, Die Hard franchise, Commando, Red Heat, Missing In Action 1,2, 48 Hrs. , Steel Dawn, Road House, Black Dog, John Wick, Speed, The Matrix Trilogy flicks, Terminator 1,2 & 3, Predator 1,2, RoboCop 1,2, Beverly Hills Cop 1,2, Death Wish 3, Universal Soldier, Cyborg and many more action movies that are all better.

The amount of fourth wall breaking (that everyone did expect for), genuine humour and gory action is what Deadpool is and therefore, what Ryan Reynolds is. It's Everything you need in a film to be honest. I have more favourite films than this to be completely honest like The Dark Knight and Whiplash, but to be honest, Deadpool hits me at a different level which is the reason why I review it!

It's funny, it's true to the character and it's got heart. Them THREE things put together make a new, fresh and revolutionary superhero movie that I can't recommend enough.The types of people who will like this are fans of Deadpool, fans of the hyper awareness/fourth wall breaking comedy and people who just want a raunchy, fun time. Would Recommend!# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool and his performance in this excuses 'Green Lantern' and 'Baraka' for me. He stole the show and has found a role he can own. Morena Baccarin was great as Vanessa. Brianna Hildebrande was great as Megasonic Teenage Warhead which is, the greatest name in any movie... ever. Stefan Kapicic was good as the voice of Collossus. T.J. Miller was great as Weasely. Gina Carano was OK as Angel. Ed Skrein played a generic villain and just didn't do a great job. Ajax was also a VERY weak villain. This was a solid origin story that was very well told. Despite this, the actual plot was kinda weak and the ending was nothing special. It introduced Deadpool but the story itself doesn't do much to impress.The cinematography was fine. The effects were passable. This movie perfectly set up Deadpool and his unique comedy style and persona. The action was great and the humour was spectacular. Obviously not everyone will find it funny but those that enjoy this will be crying of laughter throughout the movie. It was so true to the character and I respect the film for that.The music was pretty cool.Personally, I absolutely loved this movie and it stands on a pedestal with the best Superhero movies.9/10"

I'd heard it was great but was under the impression it was a 12a so when the violence and swearing started I was like 'wait, this is an adult film?'.Anyway, I like adult films so no problemo.Deadpool is actually an amazing character, yes his humour is slightly teenage boy and I never laughed out loud but I was amused. Husband was in hysterics.The romantic element was quite sweet. His lover is beautiful and charming and I really liked her.I am a die hard horror fan with no knowledge of Marvel/ super hero/comic stuff so for me to have enjoyed this says a lot.Very well written, acted and thoroughly enjoyable fun."

No, give it a go.. it's different. Yes? Watch it!, I'm guessing you already know it's different to the usual marvel.Do you like swearing, somewhat graphic violence,innuendo, racy banter, some racy ""adult"" scenes, smut, sarcasm and pretty un PC conversations? Good, you'll be fine No? I'd skip this one for sure and watch some more fluffy marvel. ( or skip to the fluffy Xmen Lite & cutesy couple conversation scenes)This movie is edgy, twisted and funny as. The plot IS basic and predictable but, the fillers and content make up for it in spades. I haven't laughed/ cringed so much in a while. The story of Mr Pool is a sexy, humorous, adrenaline filled riot worth your time."

",0.2263,0.9986,2017-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Fast funny and furious, summarizes well the three elements that combined in the right dose make this movie such a success. Fast -- action packed at the right pace. Fun- Humour all over, witty humour, gross humour, cheeky humour, white humour, sexy humour, intellectual humour, smart-ass humour, you name it, it is in there. Furious - violent to the extreme, no concessions to the sensitive stomach, but funny violent if that can be said. The movie also has a great script, great characters, awesome dialogues, spectacular action scenes, amazing staging and production, great tempo, crazy fun credits, a good ending, awesome music (just when it is needed) and the right length. The result is one of those super-hero movies that will delight both super-hero movie fans and people who, like me, aren't usually into the genre or into super-violent movies.Reynolds really shines in his role of Deadpool, because, in a way, his personal humour is that of Deadpool, and the character fits him like a glove. I honestly think that all actors are perfect in their respective roles, really well cast.It is really refreshing finding a super-hero movie that doesn't feel cookie-cuttered, that addresses adults with respect, a movie that feels fresh and modern, that is not only entertaining but well filmed, well acted and well-rounded overall -- a super-hero movie that is actually very good.I'm looking forward to seeing the second installment.

Direction was terrific but the story was not at its best. Right from the start when Deadpool introduces us to what is there to see in the movie, leading to an awesome and one of the best action sequence I have seen in the movie. His punching dialogues and high octane action is the real hero in this movie. The movie delivers what was promised. There is action, there is love, there is revenge, there is emotions. Honestly, I had never heard of Deadpool before I saw this movie. After seeing it, I had to find out more about him as I loved him. Now I can't wait to see a sequel..."
" Perpetual death-drive's the allure
",0.0,-0.4205,2017-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I guess the reason it's so easy to divinate Deadpool is that his self- destruction, the normal humans' death-drive alike (as explained by psychoanalysis) actually drives him toward greatness, immortality even - this is what we're often driven to believe in our lives as well (besides immortality, guys, I hope no one is so naive).Only when reality kicks in, we tend to stop, regain control, get back to our terms, realize that these self-destructive processes we put ourselves through as coping mechanisms might actually lead to perishing of our existence. On the most basic level, who doesn't like to get trashed of alcohol on a Saturday night for that matter?This is where Deadpools' humor kicks in as another tool of success for this impeccable story, to help us cope with the inabilities that we face and fail to overcome, especially psychologically. Well not exactly the same inabilities, but hey, Deadpool might be immortal now but his face's ugly as life that he now has to live forever, so we ain't the only ones with problems.Very captivating film without this pretentious effort of other superhero movies, but still full of glittery artifice and shinny CGI. No wonder a lot of people might be hardly waiting for the second part, and who knows how many more."

It is a fun to watch Movie, but I would not Watch it again. If you are searching for a deep Storyline, then this is not the movie to watch, which I think, was not planed for this Movie."

I think I had the strength to watch 15-20 minutes before I was completely disgusted of how really really bad this is. How in the name of all that's holy has this movie got this high rating? The last hour and twenty minutes of the movie I actually was forced to fast forward the movie to stop me from putting my fingers in TV's wall socket. I rather play with my sisters tweezers pulling my own noose hair than to even speak about this movie again.Please, what ever you do, don't see this movie. Save that time for something more useful. And Mr. Reynolds, I will forgive you this time, and forget that you ever did this movie. I'm now going to put soap in my eyes to help wash away anything that's left of the memory of this big pile of monkey poo."

But hearing how some people absolutely LOVED this film, I knew I wanted to give it another go. After the credits rolled, I understood why I had such an issue with it and why some folks were incredibly devoted. If you're unfamiliar with Stan Lee's Marvel X-Men franchise, most of the inside jokes will be lost on you.Putting that aside, the special effects were incredible, as was the sound mixing. But not knowing X-Men characters or previous plot-lines definitely put me at a disadvantage. As well, I did find a lot of the dialogue and double-entendres off-putting and incredibly crude. It's obvious how this movie was geared to a specific younger demographic and not as a general public offering.For the couple of jokes I did find humorous, and the very well done sound/special effects, I'm giving 'Deadpool' 4* out of 10."

You get a few grins here and there... and that's it."
" Potty mouth archangel out for justice
",0.5267,0.9991,2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"Highly invented parody of the super hero genre, with Ryan Reynalds at his cocksure best. It seems the super hero movie has been in vogue for the past few years now, with studios clambering to release any kind of movie, TV show or animation attached to a super hero premise. There was a time when studios waited to unleash their tent pole super hero movies onto the world. This usually followed a long laborious period of rumours of actors playing the part, directors walking in and out of production, script writers and script doctors being hired and fired. Now it seems that every six months a new super hero movie or new look super hero is being reborn, rebuilt, re-configured, renewed, re-hashed, re-imagined or just plain revealed. Add to this the fact that within these movies are a scatter gun of loosely attached characters who will go on to have their own movie releases. This really does say all you need to know about the state of the Hollywood movie making process at this moment in time, and perhaps says more about international audiences appetite for spandex clad crapola.Now add to this the new Deadpool movie. A movie which is so self aware of its roots as a super hero movie it borders on the pastiche. The joke in Deadpool is that the character is aware he is in a movie, that alone is enough to separate it from the usual slam bang visuals of the ordinary super hero movie. Now factor in that he is a foul mouthed, sex-obsessed, drug abusing, wise-cracking, mutant hero, and you begin to start wondering how this movie ever made it to the cinemas. In this age of polished, stars and stripes, hero obsessed genre of movie making, it is refreshing that Hollywood deemed it worthy to add to the cannon the antithesis of the super hero, and that antithesis is Deadpool.Whilst not totally re-inventing the wheel, Deadpool succeeds through it's sheer disregard for the genre. Deadpool wears it's 'R' rated badge proudly, neither trying to kowtow to the box office 'PG' crowd nor go full blood and guts towards insatiable violence. It straddles a fine line between the two, providing some clever 'meta' references to it's modern audience, whilst at the same time being visually eye popping with some deft cartoon style OTT violence. Even though at heart this is a super hero movie, with a character that has been present in comic book form for decades, and is straddled with a plot reminiscent of any Marvel/DC movie/origin tale that you care to mention. Deadpool comes across as fresh and a nice tonic to what we have seen of the tired comic book genre so far.When you start to analyse why it works you begin to realise that it falls nicely onto the feet of one Ryan Reynalds. Ever since Ryan limped onto our screens as Van Wilder in the early noughties, he has been an actor who has been left in a state of limbo artistically. Whilst good looking and toned and more than capable of holding a romantic lead, he could never quite shake his obvious comedic chops, always delivering a line as if he was laughing to himself on the inside. Thus we saw his peers such as Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio even Ben Affleck (all in the same age bracket) go on to make more serious movies with great success, all successfully transitionally from drama to action with little fuss. Whereas Reynalds appeared to be left behind still trying to define his acting, unsure if he was a romantic lead, action hero or a comedian.In Deadpool I feel Ryan has rediscovered his range. In essence he is not an actor to be taken seriously, nor a superhero who we can convincingly believe is capable of saving the world. For me he is a modern day Chevy Chase, all knowing smiles and smarmy charm. He is a throwback to the 80's comedic sensibility where it was OK to laugh at people who were different or less good looking than you. He is the actor we all love to hate, overly confident, limited in range, lacking in subtleties, and way too quick with a one liner. But when he is good, he is great, and when he is bad, he is just damn unwatchable. In Deadpool he is note perfect.That isn't to say that Deadpool is a perfect movie. As part of the X-Men entourage it does spread it's bets by including links to the X-Men saga, clearly with a view to cashing in on a Deadpool/X- Men collaboration at some time in the future. However, this link seems somehow fitting. Deadpool as a comic book character exists alongside the X-Men, furthermore the inclusion of Colossus is in itself a joke, and one that is cleverly interspersed into the script, rather than ham fistedly wedged in to tie the two entities together.A fun, inventive spin on the super hero genre, and a much welcomed breath of fresh air to the current status quo of Hollywood blockbusters. It will be interesting to see how Deadpool develops in his inevitable sequel and if the powers that be have the balls to put their money where their mouth is and give him free reign in an X-Men spin off. Judging by how well this movie came together, all signs look good."

Some jokes I almost didn't catch and considering how many subtle touches there are I'm sure there are things that blew right past me. Good thing I intend to rewatch it over and over again. I have to be honest and say some jokes didn't land with me because I'd heard them a hundred times in the trailers. But don't for a second think the best jokes were wasted. The humor evolves throughout the film; waking you up during the opening credits, and building from there as you jump back and forth between the love struck Wade Wilson and the post ""cancer cure"" Wade Wilson. This style of story telling worked really well in terms of giving us lots of bang for our buck evenly across all three acts while still being able to tell us what we need to know about Deadpool's ""origin"".Ryan Reynolds makes this film. TJ Miller is kind of just TJ Miller, which is usually fine because no one's better at being TJ Miller than TJ Miller but as a really big fan of Weasel (yes such a thing exists) I was disappointed that writing wise they sidelined his canon purpose in Deadpool's life, but I have to be fair and say the changes worked for the story. I couldn't get enough of Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, and Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead was so damn cool and we better get more of her in this universe! But back to Ryan Reynolds. Not only was he born to play this part but thank the film gods that he was a producer. When that was announced shortly after the test footage leak I was so relieved. Deadpool is mostly masked for the film, and what a joy it is to see the scarred comic nut job come to life on screen.I had people in my group who weren't at all familiar with Deadpool before this and it was fun to hear them enjoy the film and talk about it afterwards with lots of praise and energy. Any fan will cry tears of joy to see this property handled better than we could have dreamed."

" Movie Review of Deadpool (2016): Old Vs New
",0.0,0.9983,2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Marvel has delivered yet another blessing to audiences around the world with their hilarious antihero movie, Deadpool, in 2016. The movie's main characters are Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, the antihero, and Ed Skrein as Ajax, the villain. In the original comics, Deadpool is first introduced into the Marvel universe as a hit-man named Wade Wilson. He learns that he has cancer and is tricked into participating in the secret Canadian Weapon-X program. After going through a procedure to reproduce the healing factor of Wolverine, his the experiment fails and his character evolves into the comic schizophrenic antihero that stole the hearts of Marvel fans across multiple generations. The movie doesn't follow the comic book origin story, but it follows the general story line enough that die-hard fans won't reject the movie. Ryan Reynolds nails Deadpool's original persona as ""the merc with the mouth"", and the rest of the scripting was brilliantly suited for the situations that Deadpool would find himself in. Situations where Deadpool breaks the fourth wall, or times where he talks to an audience that doesn't exist in the movie's universe, is his main trope and one of the many reasons why he is Marvel's most loved character. Personally, I felt the movie was cleverly structured in a way that will allow Marvel Studios to build off of the Easter eggs in the movie that hint to other superheroes and create mashups of Deadpool and other characters in Marvel's inventory. If Deadpool doesn't appear in more movies in the future, then there will be many unhappy fans that will demand another Deadpool movie. I am one of those people, but I wouldn't express my anger on Twitter or Facebook, or any other social media because I know that I'm not the absolute die-hard fan that most people in the fandom seem to be. To these people, Deadpool is not just a simple character, but the pinnacle of a comic book cult's hierarchy.Numerous spin off series were made in the past that overplayed the character's nature and made him more ridiculous than deadly for the appeal of children, and with the announcement of the movie's release, fans throughout the world dawned their best cosplay of Deadpool. These cosplayers have had decently good costumes of the childish Deadpool, but the costume Ryan Reynolds received truly fulfilled his childhood dream of becoming Deadpool. I myself am a Deadpool fan, but I didn't have much information on the movie before I suggested to my family, and now I regret asking them to watch it. There was a suggestive scene in the movie that was NSFW, and made the atmosphere really awkward. I thought, ""Oh wow, I had no clue that this movie was going to have a scene like this"". So there I sat, shrinking further and further into my seat as the sounds of ""hot love"" echoed through the theater. After the movie was no better, because the first question anyone asks is, ""So, did you like the movie?"". Of course I wanted to lie and say that the movie wasn't good just because of ""that"" scene, but I couldn't bring myself to do it because that sort of closed minded thinking just wasn't right. The rest of the movie had me at the edge of my seat the entire time.In all, the movie was one of the best ""hero"" movies of recent years. The acting and cinematography, as well as the comedic timing of raunchy jokes, were all important and expertly executed to make the movie into the success that it turned out to be. Thus, Deadpool is my most highly recommended movie to date."

The violence and language enhanced the tone which I would describe as a giggling middle schooler getting away with something. I didn't think it had the depth that some reviewers seemed to attribute to it--I think the love story was more important for some than others. I thought the fact that Deadpool didn't call his girlfriend and tell her he was alive was frustrating. I kind of liked Colossus, but he looked a little too CGI. I'm not sure where I stand with Ryan Reynolds' performance. He might have been the perfect person to play Deadpool, but something about him was slightly annoying. Not much else to say, except that I will be looking forward to the sequel."

Unlike the scrawny version they have in the xmen films. This was the type of colossus we needed in the xmen films. Just to give you guys an idea how well detailed this movie is. This movie was filmed in Vancouver Canada and our vehicles in Canada go by km and underneath the km is the miles as opposed to USA where the miles is on top of the km in the instrumental gauge cluster in the vehicles and the vehicles in the movie reflect this. Not too many people would pick this up in the movie but this goes to show how much effort they've put into this. I truly hope this guy directs the next xmen film or at least assist. After Apocalypse, I do not think I would want Singer to direct ever again. Only reason why I did not give this a 10 was because I personally thought Ajax was not a good enough supervillain against deadpool."

There is no aesthetic value of cinematography, nothing emotionally gripping and the whole film is reminiscent of a bad joke played at the stupid audience who bought the ticket to such a trashy film.Somehow this film is a classic example of brainwashing of people, manipulating the most primitive instincts, appealing to the dark subconscious of the young and immature people. The film is too juvenile, however it has a R-rating so it is not really clear what audience it was made for.See more reviews at: http://indie-cinema.com/"

" Grandiose of humour

Not only does he deliver a fantastic performance as the smooth talking, slice, and dicing mercenary but he portrays one of the most beloved characters in the Marvel industry. Deadpool. A fast moving one of a kind soldier of fortune who is dishonourably discharged from the special forces to becoming part of the Sister Margaret's School for wayward girls on behalf of humanity. He or his cohorts can be contracted to do in criminals as they see fit for a price, yet he is more of a big brother than killer for those who pay a fee only to be discounted because of his giving nature.During his momentous flirtation against evil he learns he has full body cancer for which there is no cure. Paired up with a woman he had met previously at the school they become an item that has to endure the hardships of trying to find said cure in order for them both to live normal lives. When he is confronted by a shady man dressed in black wade (Reynolds) is told his infliction can be eradicated and even improved with powers of his own. Conflicted daily he takes the leap into the underworld of Ajax. His nemesis who turns his body into an immortal shell. Wade no longer has cancer but his anatomy can also eliminate any other disease even death.Brutally grotesque from a side effect wade then goes on a crusade to finding his benefactor so he can be turned back to normal but through out his days wade becomes increasingly irritated because Ajax slips through the cracks. With every job, with every thug, and with a friendly cab driver named Dalpinder wade keeps his sanity by the use of crude humour, which to me made this film what it is today. A romp of ultra violence, with breath taking action from beginning to end, and on top of that uses eighties music to top it off like a cherry.Deadpool to me is brilliant turn of thrill where a person can laugh their butts off while watching a cool character turn a city into a viable roller coaster ride without the protective safety harness. Story, plot, theme as well as originality gave this film ten stars for its remarkable sequences of spills, chills, and down right brutality. It's not often a movie of this calibre can equal to some of the more high end block busters like X-men or Avengers. Even though Deadpool is on his own by his code of honour, Wade Wilson will live on as the most influential character to our daily lives for its wit, cathartic players, and the odds and ends of side spin actors who helped in creating a one of a kind hero.It is a wonderful addition to my library where I can watch it again, and again until the next instalment comes out next year. From what I heard it is just as loud, violent, and crazy funny as the first film. Highly recommended to all hero fans all over the world, young and old. Although for the young... ages of seventeen and up is appropriate."

My dear wife less so but she usually lets me watch both black humour and the Marvel genre if I insist. This time, it was stop watching or divorce is on the horizon. I actually had to agree and we went on to watch something less juvenile.I can't fathom why anyone would watch this whole movie without walking out. Crappy jokes based on gore and car crashes are not entertainment. I have said in other posts on IMDb that art and entertainment are not mutually exclusive. In fact, at most times they go hand in hand. Deadpool is neither art nor entertainment. It well deserves the back of the hand it received for any major award for 2016.Really awful, trust me."

Tim Millers direction and the action sequences are equally hyper violent and thrilling as well as the supporting cast, which is solid too. But again, this is Reynolds movie all the way and he more than makes up for the train wreck that was Green Lantern back in 2011. So yeah, Deadpool is pretty great. It's not perfect, but this unconventional superhero love story works on almost every level, and if you're in the mood for a good time, I'd suggest giving Deadpool a try."

The story is told in a back and forth between the present and flash back, with the last few minutes moving forward to the end. The action scenes are full of slow motion and freezes. Deadpool constantly talks to the audience. It's bad movie making 101.The story is generic superhero origin - the bad guys give him super powers while at the same time messing him up. He gets revenge.It might have been watchable if it had less of the bad jokes and a straight line story.

This movie combined all those annoying features into the most genius, innovative, and eye-opening movie of all times. For once we, as watchers, are presented with a righteous killer (you know it's true) on a path of legit destruction who is not afraid of spilling blood, ridiculing everything and everyone whenever he can (kudos to Ryan Reynolds) and wherever he can.

I was skeptical about that claim, because I'm still not convinced that those two terms aren't mutually exclusive. I've seen it now, and as near as I can tell, ""adult"" really means that it's got a dirtier mouth and more graphic violence, which makes me despair a bit about the state of adulthood in America. But I will say that I enjoyed it much more than any superhero movie in recent memory, because it's actually funny and doesn't take itself seriously. But that's also fairly faint praise, because I've pretty much given up on superhero movies and can't even remember the last one I saw.Ryan Reynolds can be very funny, but he can also be very annoying, and he's about equal parts both in this film. The movie has a potty mouth that is mostly used to clever and witty effect, and some gratuitous nudity is always a-OK with me. But what kept me from really enjoying this film was the casual violence, much of it played for laughs. I guess this is where the ""adult"" thing comes in, because I just can't find myself enjoying the gun fetishism in a movie like this. The actual gun problems in the real world are too immediate and too concerning to me to be able to relax into the fantasy of a movie like this, and my stomach curdles at the thought of the whooping and hollering that I have no doubt went on in audiences of this film as the bullets and the blood flew.And though there was talk, however brief, about this film actually getting some Oscar attention, that talk was ridiculous. Nothing about this movie was that good.Grade: B-"

" I know I'm the minority...
",0.0,0.9983,2017-02-01 00:00:00,4,"Deadpool comes from a place rooted in Marvel-mania and geekdom. The entire premise seems like one born from the want of fans to have it so, and in fact much of the content of the movie suggests it by winking at the camera at every possible opportunity. It has already been a massive box office success, and as of February 17th it has nearly a 9.0 on IMDb. I didn't enter the film with high expectations (similar to my feelings about Guardians of the Galaxy) so I can't say I was surprised to realize the film is an utter let-down.It seems like Marvel is making a new movie every few months or so, and it seems like an easy chore for them to dish out a movie, throw in a couple recognizable characters, and watch the cash come rolling in. The wackier the story, the 'bigger chance' it was to make, but have they ever had a true flop? The comic book world has impregnated our psyche, whether you have read them or not. Everyone wants to be in the 'know.'Deadpool seems to be a response to Guardians, following an unlikely 'superhero' (Ryan Reynolds) as he casually jokes through a plot that would otherwise be full of immense peril. When Chris Pratt challenged the evil galaxy-ruler guy to a dance off at the climax of Guardians, it felt funny and fresh. When Deadpool stops in a battle to look at the camera and mention a joke about Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, I just sighed. There's a self- awareness throughout the film that simply removed me from the movie. At one point, Reynolds remarks ""don't make my costume CGI"" as he begins his superhero transformation (a painful reference to his Green Lantern stint). This is like a grown-up Airplane parody, where characters know they are acting and the good guy never misses his target no matter how far away he is with the gun. Most people I have talked to describe this movie as a fresh comedy. I saw it as a parody a bit too on-the-nose.Knowing nothing about Deadpool/Wade going in, of course we had to trudge through a backstory filled with sex and jokes and throwaway characters that all culminate in the creation of his costume, stitched at home of course (red hides the blood better). We learn that though he fell in love, Deadpool was diagnosed with cancer and left the woman he loved in order to find a cure. What he found as well was a new power of rejuvenation, strength, and witty one-liners.Let's be honest: Ryan Reynolds is an attractive guy. Ladies love him and guys want to be him. Besides this, his role in this film just falls flat. Through narration, breaking the 4th wall, voice-over, and cutaways, all I wanted was for him to shut up. Sometimes, a simple action scene is cool in itself without being littered with gags and humor and comedy, oh my! Playing the comedian, of course the rest of the cast (a couple of X-Men I have never heard of that were apparently the only ones available for the shoot) plays it straight, gawking at the absurdity of Deadpool's light-heartedness and trying to convince him to just shut up and focus on the task at hand. The task at hand (defeating the villain – what else?) is a cookie-cutter plot that is as predictable as we would expect. I mentioned he is aided by some of the X-Men, so it should come as no surprise that Deadpool comments on the fact that studios couldn't afford more recognizable actors for some quick cameosYou can tell the filmmakers were trying to be original (an opening credits scene that is nothing but puns and in-jokes: ""directed by someone who was paid too much,"" ""starring the sexist man in America,"" etc. If that's comedy, then I'm sorry I didn't laugh. If the fanboys are happy with the film, then I'm sure the Marvel Studio is pleased. Perhaps in a year or two when they release Deadpool II, they can work out the kinks that weighted this film down. For a movie so highly regarded as a hip romantic comedy, boy was I bored."
" Deadpool*******
",0.0,0.9527,2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Ryan Reynolds was made for Deadpool, he is Deadpool. You've gotta give him praise for his performance as the character, then again I feel like he's just playing himself. The movie was a fast, funny, and fourth wall breaking. It was a straight forward and entertaining movie, you'd get a kick out of this, nonetheless. I enjoyed the chemistry Ryan Reynold's Wade Wilson/Deadpool & Morena Baccarin's Vanessa had, loved every scene when they're together. Only problem I had was the character is constantly trying to tell jokes during moments where it wasn't needed, which in my opinion, kills the flow. As a long time comic book fan, I understand Deadpool's character but that obviously isn't my cup of tea. Overall, a very good film. Director Tim Miller to me deserves a lot of credit too."
" Deadpool is a masterpiece!
",0.6588,0.8808,2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Deadpool is a masterpiece for the following reasons: beyond the traditional rules and Hollywood stereotypes, is irreverent, vulgar and violent beyond belief, the action scenes simply perfect, hilarious dialogues (though vulgar for an audience of minors, but not much they would understand the jokes). Ryan Reynolds is perfect in the part, as indeed all the characters. Many hate it, but they have not caught the ironic spirit of the character or simply do not know and were expecting a film type Spider- Man or Iron-Man, but Deadpool is not any of it and enjoy it is a hoot in a rush . I can not wait to come out Deadpool 2 in 2018."
" Where's Bugs Bunny when you need him?
",0.0,0.9538,2017-01-20 00:00:00,3,"This is a self-satisfied, sexist little romp, with a few laughs and an affable central performance from Ryan Reynolds, one of many Ben Affleck clones currently doing the Hollywood rounds. It amazes me that anyone could possibly mistake it as in any way progressive. Its postmodern ""We know we're in a movie""is as contemporary as a Bugs Bunny cartoon.Ed Skrein gives good villain, it's a treat to see Leslie Uggams enjoying herself in a supporting role, and there's a nice sardonic turn from T.J. Miller. The music, by Junkie XL aka Tom Holkenborg, is, in contrast to the movie as a whole, unselfconsciously generic, and is all the more enjoyable for it.DEADPOOL will pass slightly too much of your time. It could have been shortened by ten minutes without anyone noticing. Otherwise, there's not a lot to be said for it."
" DEADPOOL is Almost Everything I'd Hoped it Would Be
",0.3262,0.9985,2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"It might sound cliché now because the market is being flooded with the character but Deadpool has been my favorite comic character for a while. I've wanted the Merc with the Mouth to get his own big screen movie for years, thinking Ryan Reynolds would be perfect for the role since his performance in BLADE TRINITY as wisecracking Hannibal King. I was excited for Reynolds to assume the role of Wade Wilson in X- MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE and devastated when the character was mutilated by the studio. I'd come to accept the fact that we'd probably never see a true Deadpool cinema incarnation and, lo and behold, Reynolds and crew come through in 2016. DEADPOOL wasn't just a fun, relatively faithful adaptation of my favorite Marvel character but a much needed break from comic book movie routine with the film's proud embracing of the R-rating and utilization of the Deadpool comic tropes we'd come to expect but assumed studios would nix for being ""too weird"" for general audiences. In an effort to reeducate the unknowing masses, DEADPOOL serves as an origin film, explaining to those unfamiliar how Deadpool came to be horribly scarred, certifiably crazy, and essentially immortal. Wade Wilson (Reynolds) is a mercenary for hire who, shortly after finding his soul mate in equally damaged working girl Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With limited options, he turns to the mysterious Ajax (Ed Skrein) who claims he can heal Wilson of his disease. And an antihero is born.DEADPOOL gets a lot of things right and a few things, well, not so much wrong as poorly handled. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy this movie and I'm psyched at the level of success this little ""comic book movie that couldn't"" has achieved. It was a stroke of luck that the movie ever saw production and the love of audiences to the tune of almost $800 billion in worldwide gross box office all but guarantees we won't have to fight so long to see the continuing adventures. Reynolds is exactly as perfect for the role as we'd all known he would be. He gets the character and truly brings him to life with all the wisecracks, juvenile humor, and bloody violence we'd hoped to see. The costume is fantastic, staying incredibly faithful to the comics and even giving his mask expressive eyes to bring it to life. I also loved the inclusion of T.J. Miller to the cast as Deadpool's buddy Weasel. I've been a fan of Miller for a little while and figured his absurd brand of improvised comedy would be an apt fit in the world of DEADPOOL. The two of them ensure that DEADPOOL is just as much a comedy as it is an action movie, which is exactly as it should be. Deadpool doesn't bring the senses of dread or stoic heroism that comes with the usual X-Men film. In DEADPOOL, our hero puts bullets in brainpans and turns violence into insane performance art.Deadpool is, of course, a character from the X-Men universe and as a result we get a couple of cameos to establish this. As to which X-Men cinematic universe we're rooted in, it confuses even Deadpool himself (""McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines can get so confusing.""), but he's given the chance to fight alongside fan-favorite and criminally-underused Colossus and his current mutant trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). These two act as the straight-edged, voices of reason to Deadpool's fourth-wall-breaking craziness in his search for revenge against Ajax. I loved both of them, especially Negasonic. We don't get much out of her character but her angsty teenage persona sets Deadpool up for some fun punchlines and her explosive powers come in handy during the final battle. Colossus is here to give valuable life lessons to Deadpool in hopes of swaying him to the forces of good. I enjoyed the odd-couple pairing of Colossus and Deadpool but I imagine we'll get better banter in the sequel where the end credits coda promises we'll be introduced togo watch for yourself. No spoilers here but it should be obvious to fans. Meanwhile, Colossus serves the role well even if he is comically preachy in his heroic speeches. I love that we finally get an accurate on-screen portrayal (huge, muscular, and Russian) but the CG wasn't always the greatest. It's easily forgiven, and still pretty impressive, considering the limited budget. It makes one hopeful we'll get to see Deadpool's unique brand of crazy interact with other X-Men in future installments.DEADPOOL isn't without its flaws. The plot is disappointingly simplistic. It's your average origin tale intermixed with a revenge plot, but at least it uses nonlinear storytelling to break it up a bit. Most of the origin element is given through flashbacks over the course of a freeway chase/battle that fills the first hour or so of the movie. Plus everyone beside Deadpool is relegated to two-dimensional characters who only exist to serve a plot purpose. Ajax, Vanessa, Weasel, and especially Ajax's second-in- command Angel Dust (Gina Carano) are pretty thin characters. DEADPOOL is pretty much a one-man show with the Merc with the Mouth taking center-stage and everyone else taking a backseat to his showboating. It's fine though. It's fun. And pretty violent so, you know, leave the kids home for this one. As Deadpool would tell you, he's the best there is at whatever Wolverine does. Wolverine never quite got to cut loose in the X-Men films to the extent Deadpool does here and, superhero or not, this is not a family film. The R-rating should've been a dead giveaway but I'm amazed at how I saw kids at my first screening. In short, DEADPOOL is a comic book movie for people who are tired of comic book movies, while still stumbling into same pitfalls of franchise-opening comic book movies."

I've always despised marvel movies for their simplistic design of the world and people .( their world is composed by good people against bad ones). This one tried to break up with all this schemes with humor and we can salute this try but waiting for better in the following sequel. The movie seemed sometime like a funny farce , the link between deadpool and Xmen universe have been made light so to harden the satiric aspect of the movie . it still movie suffer from of a lack of work in personages composure (except of deadpool) and dialogues. the director seemed to made this episode like an introduction of the personage of Deadpool more than anything else ."

A Batman like character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and to gain sympathy of the viewers, we are informed of his terminal cancer diagnosis.What was this movie essentially about? Who was that old blind woman carrying heat?How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actor in a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord he didn't win the award.There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a life-time."

In my opinion I vote 2 because the film is very bad, 0 laugh for me, too much insults, male chauvinism... If u laugh with insults, vulgarities, rudeness, this is your film. Good Luck if you see the film for the rate. Loose of time. Only has a little bit good special effects and the protagonists have a very pretty body. This is not sufficient for me. I hope or you not too. If you want get revenge for one spoiler or something, say him/her that Deadpool is very good film, that you laugh all time with it.Regards"
" The story is a bit on the thin side but the character of Deadpool and the generally humorous tone adopted more than compensates for its shortcomings
",0.5267,0.9971,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Former Special Forces Operative Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) takes part in a rogue experiment which on the flip side gives him the ability to heal rapidly, but on the downside this experiment leaves with permanent and unsightly scarring to his entire body. When Wilson is left for dead by Ajax (Ed Skrein) after the experiment has been completed, Wilson makes it his mission to gain revenge on Ajax and becomes Deadpool - Wilson's masked alter-ego.Within the first few minutes of this film I had an inkling that I was going to like it. The opening credits are amusing and quite imaginative; I particularly loved the Directed By 'An Overpaid Tool' caption.The opening segment of the film where we're introduced to Deadpool - the fast-talking crazed anti-hero are probably some of the best moments in the film and Reynolds is clearly at his best in this film when he becomes Deadpool. I have to be honest and admit that I did find it a bit jarring when the film cuts to the 'origin story' which ultimately took on a much more serious tone. This isn't a bad thing as the 'origin story' was interesting enough, but I still found it a bit of a shock to my system at first due to how impressive and explosive the opening few minutes of the film were.The story itself is rather weak and in some ways it seems ironic that the film spends so much time sending itself up and making fun of itself only to then have a rather clichéd and predictable plot line and outcome. The turn of events in the final third aren't bad and there are still plenty of amusing moments, but given the fact that it seemed to have some imagination to it I just expected a bit more that's all.Another slight problem with this film lies with Wade Wilson; although he is an anti-hero when he becomes Deadpool he is also an anti-hero when he is Wade Wilson himself. The problem is that before he becomes Deadpool he isn't a particularly likable person and I did feel that sometimes he got what he deserved. This, in some ways, made him a rather unlikeable character (pre-accident) meaning that it was harder to get behind him when he became his alter-ego. I personally feel that a good anti-hero should have some likability or a reason to root for them in order to be successful and I never really felt that way about Deadpool or Wade Wilson, but like I said the sense of fun that the film brings means that these things don't cause that much of a problem. That being said though, when Reynolds is Deadpool this film never lets up and is an absolute blast to watch. The sending up and parodying that it offers is imaginative and very funny. The fourth wall stuff is pretty amusing - although it does get a bit repetitive. If you liked Kick-Ass then I think that this film will be right up your street. Therefore despite a thin story and a rather flawed protagonist, this film is funny, imaginative and self-aware enough to more than compensate for its very minor shortcomings and is something that I would highly recommend."
" Warning this is Rated R
",-0.34,0.9948,2017-01-06 00:00:00,9,"DEADPOOL!!!! This film is amazing, why you ask because of Ryan Renolds! Not only was his performance true to the character but he was involved every step of the way to make this film. After X-Men The Wolverine Origins put a crappy Deadpool on screen we are lucky enough to have seen this. Now talking about the film. This film uses non-linear story-telling, Narriation, 4th wall breaking, a montage and lots of great action and comedy. Deadpool can do anything and the creators of the film took this to the next level, just look at all the marketing. For a film that had a 60 Million budget, it was incredible. Deadpool is not just a superhero movie but also a romance, comedy, and tragedy if you will. Deadpool is true to the comics which makes this movie great. Theirs a lot of great comedy from Ryan Renolds and TJ Miller and great action. Overall I give this film a 9.5/10 for being amazing. If you're wondering why no 10/10 it's because I found some of the scenes where they make fun of their X-Men films or the Studio a little head hitting. Deadpool one of my favorite of 2016 and looking forward to CABLE."

" Med school dead fool...
",-0.6486,0.9444,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Although it peters out about three-quarters of the way through, the first three quarters of DEADPOOL are definitely worth sitting through: the movie's funny and cynical, with a definite ""who gives a f---"" attitude toward comic book super heroes. (By their own admissions, a number of the writers of comics from the early to the mid-1970s wrote said comics while indulging in a variety of mind-altering drugs. While this didn't make for BETTER comics, it certainly made for DIFFERENT ones. DEADPOOL fits right in with them.) It's interesting that not a lot of people seem to have gotten wind of the fact that DEADPOOL is really a flipping of the bird to comic book superheroes and their now quaint codes of conduct. The character himself might just as easily have been a Villain as a Hero, although his past as a corporate assassin pretty much settles that issue (at least, for ME it does). Written with an eye toward its target audience (young teens), DEADPOOL often straddles the fence between Adult and Adolescent entertainment. If one can hark back to one's misspent youth, one CAN enjoy DEADPOOL, despite its blatant catering to the under-twenty mentality. (It's the seemingly endless cgi finale that brings the movie to a screeching halt, the way cgi finales almost ALWAYS bring movies to a screeching halt; some of these animated sequences drag out so long that one finds oneself drifting off into daydreams of other things.) Better than average, but a far cry from Great."

Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson, the former quarterback of the Minnesota Vikings; oops, wrong Wade Wilson. OK, he is really the father of that volleyball and BFF of Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"". OK, enough!!!! Reynolds' character Wilson is a fast-talking mercenary who discovers has late stage cancer. Wilson then takes an opportunity from an underground group that promises him that they can cure his cancer and give him superpowers. I know that most of America, and the World for that matter, has seen this movie; but in order not to be in the spoilerpool , I will not divulge more on the plot. I do have to tell you that because of Wilson's dilemma, arises Deadpool. Writers Rhett Reese and Pauk Wernick did go into their pool of witty zingers to deliver to Deadpool's witty verbal attack. Director Tim Miller did pull through with some nicely orchestrated sequences, but at times did get trapped into the formulaic ""bang bang"" superhero scenic action. Reynolds was the superhero of ""Deadpool""; his performance was superb. So if you haven't already, take a dip in the ""Deadpool"". **** Good"
