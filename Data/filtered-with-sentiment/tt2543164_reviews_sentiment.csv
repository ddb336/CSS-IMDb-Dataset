" Boring...
",0.0,0.0567,2021-03-30 00:00:00,2,"People whom give this movie a high rating either don't understand it, low IQ, or pretending to be smart.Aliens with advance technologies, capable of light speed or perhaps wormhole travel have the appearance of squids with giant claws. How are they supposed to have the dexterity like we humans does to create, invent things.This is the stucked image we have for aliens since the movie ""Alien"". Thought this movie brings some intelligence but nope, let down.Arrival, is a slow burn movie with nothing interesting going.Skip this one or watch and be bored."

",0.5859,0.6997,2021-03-22 00:00:00,10,This movie is really beautiful. It was emotional experience that went beyond just watching a movie. The emotions that it evoked in me has stayed with me.
" Unusual work on an unusual subject
",0.0,0.8176,2021-03-22 00:00:00,9,"A stunningly well made film, well written, and perfectly acted. Few stories have as much potential, and are as often poorly presented, as the now classic First Contact story. As a writer how does one portray something truly ""Alien"" without becoming overly simplistic, or intentionally horrific? The writer must imagine the impossible to imagine, what it means to be a non-human, even a non-mammal, the writer must understand a being that emerged from a completely different evolutionary pattern, and then have them interact with us. Most stories use an easy route, the Alien is humanoid, allowing the writer to create the story and move on, such as still wonderful and well made ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" for example. However in ""Arrival"" the writer adopted a little known aspect of our own human unconscious actions ( the tendency of how language determines the thought process ) and explores what it would mean if a completely alien species approaches us with no common forms of communication, and we are forced to understand theirs, just as they are forced to understand us."
" Tries hard to be intelligent
",0.3818,0.4939,2021-03-21 00:00:00,5,"Another sci-fi movie that tries to be intelligent but ends up being merely dull. I get it, it's a good question to ask how we will communicate with aliens - but there's so much more that could've made this movie better - it ends up being a boring watch."
" All ""Arrival"" movies need to Depart!
",0.0,-0.7689,2021-03-20 00:00:00,2,"This movie is just not worth the time and effort that went into making it. It ran out of steam about 10 minutes into the movie and became a rambling and meandering road to nowhere. It's message, if there was one, got lost along the way. It was just......really stupid!"
" Slow start but ultimately worthwhile
",0.4767,-0.2838,2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,I expected a typical fast slam bang laser blasting action flick. What I got was what science fiction can be in the hands of good writers. Too many film makers rely on action to disguise the fact they really don't have anything to say. This film isn't like that. It takes you on a journey of discovery into humanity's core. I suspect the bad revues came from young viewers who have the attention span of a housefly or people with all the depth of a birdbath. All in all a thought provoking and hopeful story. We need more of these positive films.

Here it is in a nutshell;Male dominated military is stupid and afraid. Their solution to everything is violence and destruction.

She snatches peace from the jaws of imminent destruction.These are the values signaled;Men stupid -

" It has to be the most implausible and unintelligent movie I ever watched.
",-0.5046,-0.9601,2021-03-11 00:00:00,2,"The initial idea and the presentation might be good but the execution is just horrible.
It just pulls you out of the story with ""This is so stupid, this would never happen"".A entire advanced alien race that lands on earth is uncapable to learn our language even while they had the time to prepare in advance, but one random linguist learns it on the go like a regular person that takes a language class or reads a language book to learn a foreign language.Aliens teach the main protagonist literally magic that breaks causality.
Then just disappear, considering their abilities they could have achieved that in couple of minutes without even the rest of the world noticing it.I have to assume this is the dumbest movie ever made, just from a rational perspective.
What is even more shocking is that they even had scientific advisers, best case scenario is that they either didn't listen to them or didn't understand what they said and proceeded without waiting for a feedback.P.S:
U.S. saves the day cliché.
China, Russia and so on start to act evil."

" Slow-paced but worth the effort.
",0.3291,0.993,2021-03-08 00:00:00,10,"Many movies are classified as science fiction but really don't deserve the moniker. The Star Wars movies are action fantasy, and the Guardians of the Galaxy movies are pretty much just action. Actual science fiction films, while not exactly rare, are much less common than marketers would have us believe.If you're a fan of Star Wars as science fiction, Arrival isn't for you. It isn't an action movie. It moves slowly and the special effects, while - um - effective, do not dazzle the eye. Arrival is more of a treat for the mind, and the heart, than for the eye. This is a moving and hopeful story, and it goes places where only science fiction can go. Watch it alone, when you're in no hurry, or watch it with someone you love, assuming he or she can appreciate the laconic pacing.There is great beauty here, in a movie that dazzles the soul while not trying to dazzle the eye. Great beauty, for those willing to take it in.Highly recommended."

" I can't believe all the bad reviews!
",-0.5848,0.9684,2021-03-05 00:00:00,8,"This was a great movie - the acting, cinematography and musical score was amazing. At certain parts of the story I was worried about the ending, but I liked it. I think the romance between the two characters could have been hinted at a bit earlier to show chemistry, But perhaps the twist ending demanded showing so little chemistry. The other thing I would've liked to of seen which would've made this a 10 would be to learn a little bit more about what humans are supposed to do for the aliens 3000 years from now. With that said there was a bit of a plot hole at the end but it didn't deter from the beauty of the ending."
" Hmmmm
",0.0,0.34,2021-03-02 00:00:00,5,"That's the best way I could describe this movie. It started out well, with good acting by the lead and it held our interest for the most part.

" A linguist must decode an entirely foreign language when aliens land on earth.
",0.0,0.9838,2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Acting was decent. Plot is oriented towards intrigue and curiosity rather than suspense; not very fast-paced, but it kept my interest (maybe only because I'm interested in linguistics?). Romance is kind of shoe-horned in. Graphics were good but good graphics were not the point of the movie. The ending left me feeling unresolved; it was an okay ending that tied the movie together, but I felt like the movie built up towards answering larger questions that ultimately were not resolved. Overall, the premise was interesting and it was decently executed."

I think this particular movie raises so many beautiful questions which we have not an answer to them.
These kind of movies are the reason why I love cinema, it's like great literature that raises questions but leave the answer for it's audience; it provokes thought.
I simply don't like to take the enjoy from people who haven't seen it yet but I have to say this the second best movie of 2016 behind ""Moonlight""."
" Arrival (2016, Denis Villeneuve) Brainy science fiction with a hell of a twist
",-0.6808,0.9718,2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Arrival (2016, Denis Villeneuve)
From auteur Villeneuve creator of such standouts as 'Sicario' and 'Prisoners' comes this extremely cerebral science fiction first contact picture. Much more 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' than 'Independence Day' this is an exercise in communication as well as a reflection on the nature of our human existence in general. Around the globe in twelve seemingly random locations alien ships appear. Each society handles the arrival in different ways and it seems the reactions run from joy to hysteria. In America the area is quickly sealed off by the military and around the country chaos descends as rioting and looting becomes widespread. In the midst of all that we are introduced to Louise Banks, a linguist, played by Amy Adams and Ian Donnelly, a scientist, played by Jeremy Renner. They are tasked by the military, as the foremost experts in their respective fields, to figure out why the aliens are here on Earth and mainly if their intentions are hostile. The military is represented mainly in the form of Forest Whitaker's Colonel Weber. While he seems to understand the scientist's wont for diplomacy he also has superiors to answer to who are keeping the military on a short leash to a first strike option if no diplomacy can be found. There is a brief window once a day where the humans are allowed to enter the alien ship and interact, of a sort, with two of interstellar travelers. This begins an exhausting yet fascinating back and forth on trying to figure out how to communicate with the aliens. The clock is ticking as other foreign powers, mainly China, appear to be adopting a more aggressive stance toward the aliens. Throughout this we get snippets of Louise's life and she also starts to have visions and as the puzzle pieces are methodically assembled we eventually get to a marvelous twist moment of a sorts that does more than bring the story full circle. It expands our though process on what full circle might mean. This film succeeds on many levels however I still struggle with some of the themes as to how the overall mission of the aliens will wind up affecting mankind going forward. Also as the story is laid out everything works out to the point that if feels a bit contrived. As with many stories that contain a pivotal twist it is hard to discuss certain aspects of these themes without giving away too much. The movie succeeds quite well in what it set out to do and it is fascinating as a brainy science fiction piece as well as a stirring human melodrama and it's only the overarching theme for humanity that I take an issue with but if you buy what is being sold there then the film vaults from very good to possibly one of the best of the year.
Eric's Grade: B"
" Brilliant!
",0.6239,0.8908,2021-02-12 00:00:00,10,"An amazing audio-visual treat with some brilliant performance from the main cast, and a profound narrative! A classic in the making."
" I don't get it
",0.0,-0.8689,2021-02-12 00:00:00,2,"This film is a real struggle for me, a struggle to get the hype. Once the Aliens reveal their intention credibility flies out of the wiondow, the performances are stunning, but just let down by this totally lacklustre ending. Too much pomp over circumstance and its tragic, because up to 50% through the menace of this film kept me on the edge of my seat, only to disapoint in the most sensational way I hgave ever experienced."
" Absolutely different sci-fi movie but still very good in its own way
",0.6474,0.9904,2021-02-11 00:00:00,7,"I saw ARRIVAL out of curiosity because I like sci-fi movies from time to time and also because of its cast. This is one of those movies that divides audiences, in the sense that critics love it but the general public mostly doesn't understand it, as it's a sci-fi movie unlike STAR WARS or ALIEN.In this movie, some enormous space ships suddenly appear all over the world and people asks what they are doing there. Soon, Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) goes to Dr. Banks' (Amy Adams) office and asks her to join a team of researchers in the American west as she has impressive linguistic skills and will be helpful to try to communicate with the creatures inside the space ships (and they are HUGE). What follows is an incredibly cerebral movie a bit slow at times but still capable to capture the viewer's attention from time to time.The acting is probably the best asset in the movie. Amy Adams gives a very deep performance, and actually one of her best. Jeremy Renner is also very good effortlessly and Forest Whitaker is the standout of the supporting players The soundtrack is also very haunting and enhances a lot of the movie's actions. Denis Villeneuve's direction is great, not in the same level of PRISONERS but still great.In substance, a disivive movie that I liked but more in an appreciation sort of way and that at times left me a bit confused."

",0.4404,0.8268,2021-02-07 00:00:00,2,"Mystery movies will always make you think. However, this one is really a copycat of the classic twilight zone.It is about communication with the aliens. I like the classic twilight zone better, more direct. I remember it is quite well that ""the book is cook book"" or the funny version of the Simpson ""How to cook humans"" ,""How to Cook for Humans"" or ""How to cook 40 humans"" , ""How to cook for forty humans""...This one is something else, you will know when you see.Basically, this movie will bore you....

" Unbelievable ... but in a bad way
",-0.6542,-0.9123,2021-02-01 00:00:00,4,"Unfortunately there are too few ""serious"" alien themed movies that don't involve massive explosions, CGI and fantastical scenes of armageddon. With more previously-classified information being released to the public in recent years, the topic of UFOs and ""extraterrestrials"" is becoming more mainstream and less the realm of those who like to sport tinfoil hats on the weekends. As such, Arrival would have been a wonderful opportunity to imagine and examine what it would be like if we made contact and tried to communicate with aliens who landed on our planet. But, instead, it totally misses the mark.My biggest gripe is that the film lacks intelligence and complexity. It reduces humans to being brainless warmongers while aliens, who've presumably developed advanced technology to travel light years, to altruistic yet helpless, self-sacrificing pacifists. Nothing about this movie is believable! Even the discussion of linguistics totally lacks creativity or study for that matter. Let's not even bring up the topic of physics or lack thereof. Also, why is the US Army handling an event that would undoubtedly be in purview of the Air Force and why would a Colonel be calling all the shots for something of this magnitude?Overall, the acting is subpar as well (I don't know anyone who'd believe Whittaker's horrible attempt at a Bostonian accent and why would anyone write it in the script for him?). Adams and Renner are very talented actors but neither fit the part, by a long shot. I'm afraid their chemistry is also very weak.Finally, the need for an incredibly sad subplot involving of the illness and loss of the protagonist's daughter is also lost on me. The tragic imagery is clearly intended to evoke emotion but it just seems incredibly forced and out of place. Such serious cinematic themes deserve more depth.In all, I think I'm being generous by giving this movie 4.5 stars."
" Good but not great
",-0.5409,0.3392,2021-02-01 00:00:00,7,"Plenty of other reviews sum up the plot. What is good about this movie: the aliens are not some version of humanoid, talking acting thinking processing like humans. Even their language is different in numerous ways. That was refreshing. Amy Adams gave a solid performance. The idea of how complicated it is to learn a new language, especially if you are starting from scratch. What is not good about the movie: the bad guys were once again the Chinese and Russians. Again the military symbolized stupid, war hungry, rule following idiots with zero depth. Jeremy Renner's character was boring to the point of distraction. The coloring of the movie was way too bleak. Grey and blue in about 90% of the scenes. The discovery of the very basics of their language and how humans actually figure out what the various circle words meant was never explained and would have been very interesting to see. I was invested in AA's character, but beyond her I only cared about the two aliens. None of the other characters had any connection to the audience at all."

If you prefer Independence Day, you will hate it.I think it's a masterpiece. Period. I'm actually a bit shocked it's not closer to 9 and a top 20 all time movie. The script is so intelligent that it feels that you have watched 4 different movies in the end. It's a thrill ride for drama-, thriller-, action- and science fiction fans in one package.I had to compose myself for 20 minutes before leaving the theatre and it took me and my wife about 3 hours and 3 glasses of wine to talk about it afterwards."

It just struck me as I related with Dr. Banks (the linguist in the film & the main character), and I felt her fear as she entered the column to see the aliens for the first time. I nearly thought it was my first time to see aliens when I looked at the glass windows where aliens were about to arrive. So it was such a memorable film to me. Like a semi-documentary semi-Sci-Fi film, and since I don't want to spoil things, I want to mention that the story would leave you pondering upon philosophical things that you might not have thought of. At least the film made me think of the meanings of time in my life, how my existence meant in the entire universe, and how languages changed my perception of time. AND SO ON.
Love this film forever."

This pretentious muddle is using teenage philosophy musing as a scientific step up, and it does not work.

But instead, my god, I got something light years better! It made me think and feel at the same time afterwards. No films have made me this way. A perfect amalgamation of intellectual prose and emotional poetry. It was existential and beautiful... at the same time. Very few films can coalesce these two hallmarks so harmoniously and poetically - exploring the existential concept of time & language and then makes us see how it'd influence you on a profound emotional level. If you can have your whole life lays out before your eyes from start to finish, would you change things? Arrival has become one of my favorite films of all time!"

I literally made an account on IMDB to review this film and say that it is the WORST, and I've seen some pretty bad films, WORST film I have ever, I repeat, EVER seen.These aliens are like giants balls with legs, so cheap man, and don't even get me started on the plot of the movie. What is even happening in this film. I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting, because I was so excited to see it!!! I bought myself takeout, got my blanket ready for the good parts, had my fuzzy socks on, and NOTHING. I waited so long I checked how long had passed and even thought wow this movie must be pretty long because nothing has happened yet. NOTHING HAPPENS. The movie ended and for the first time in my life I thought a joke was happening like I had to flip the disk or something. Don't waste your time on this film."

" Its giving you some real life questions
",0.34,0.9183,2020-12-27 00:00:00,9,"I dont think that I overaexaggerate when I say that this film is giving you some real thinking about life, time and our place here on earth.It demonstrates that time is merely a relative thing and so is feelings such as pain and suffering.The film circulates around a team of scientists who is hired by their government (the main characters are american) when the world all of a sudden is covered by these huge tall circulare shaped floating objects who they realise are UFO's.The team is hired to try and communicate with the beeings who are inhabiting these apparent flying vehicles.During the movie we find out that the aliens are communicating on a completely different level which is none linear and using different bodily scenses as a communication way.The film really makes you think about how small pieace of what life and our place here is that we really know and how communication is of utter importance if we want to understand the world we live in and ourselves.The actors are really good and some amazing scenery.Highly recommend it!"

It's one of those few films where repeated watches continue to reveal fresh nuances even though one may already understand the brilliant story arch.

" Good, but overrated
",0.2382,0.991,2020-12-23 00:00:00,5,"I am really into time-shifting movies from 12 Monkeys, all Nolan films (Memento et al), Looper, Triangle, Primer.. you name it, I probably have seen it and loved it. The concept of changing one's perception of time through the use of language/communication is great and although I didn't know the direction this movie was going, I suspected it would go this way at a certain point.My problem with this movie is: Like I said above, it is a concept (or an idea if you will), and that does not make it a good story. Just because time-shifting is involved, does not make the story great, it is the context in which that happens! And that context was weak in this movie. The movie is very slow-paced, that is okay in general, but there is no character evolution in this movie, they are all just there, and the storytelling has to keep a lid on the only thing that is important to these otherwise boring characters: The fact that the flashbacks are flash-forwards into the future. That is everything that has to be kept away from the viewer for like most of the movie. Only in the last ca. 15 minutes it is disclosed to the viewer.. and then I realized that the whole ""story"" was preparing for this disclosure.. and when it was there I was like.. ""okay that's it?"" The plot is exactly the same as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, just leave out the mountain. (Weaker script in my opinion)Personally I didn't like the casting and performances of the main actors. Forrest Whitaker was okay, not great, but okay. And Amy Adams was way too kitsch-y at times and the other guy I forgot after 5 minutes, he was just there to prove to the audience what a genius Louise is.Conclusion: If you are a time-shift movie buff like me, you should not expect too much. If you are more interested in acting, it will probably be a better movie for you. If you are interested in alien communication you would probably think that the ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""-approach with sounds and melody would be the more realistic way to do it"
" A great artistic sci-fi film that will blow your mind!
",0.6588,0.9991,2020-12-22 00:00:00,9,"Plot:A linguist works with the military to communicate with alien lifeforms after twelve mysterious spacecrafts appear around the world.Analysis:Alien invasion was a movie theme that was heavily explored in previous decades, the idea of a whole new civilization that tries to reach us is not a new subject and it was always a very interesting ""what if"" situation. Most of the films chose the easy way of a huge war with special effects and constant battles, a fight that unites the humanity. Arrival isn't your typical sci-fi, it's a slow poetic drama that tries to examine this idea way beyond the stereotypes and try to find new meaning and messages that can be portrayed in that interaction.Instead of a fast paced movie full of adrenaline, Villeneuve tries to create a memorable drama that unfolds its story slowly, so the viewer can process the information and spot the little details that solve the puzzle of this plot. Step by step this movie becomes a more and more interesting mystery that shows a lot about human nature and language, some things that very few movies managed to do properly. It's a passionate effort to create something completely new, something memorable to open a new chapter in this genre and this success is a win for art against the commercialization of cinema. A movie theme that was used only for brainless action movies was redefined by an idealist who wants to find meaning behind every action and every little detail, that's way more than a well-written movie, that's what art is about and whether you like it or not, this film is art.The realizations about mankind in this movie are mindblowing. The way this situation is handled by those in charge and the impact of this alien arrival transfers perfectly the feeling of colonialism and how the language is decoded, created and used to achieve communication. This one goes beyond the surface and explores the whole foundation of living creatures' interaction the way no one ever did, a poetic amazing experience that will not and should not be forgotten. Our language in the tool to explore life and this movie takes this basic statement to another level, beyond any imagination, leaving the audience stunned.This amazing story was perfected by the talent of two very gifted actors like Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Their characters are the two sides to explore a unique situation and examine an alien race, the theoritical side represented by the famous linguist Louise Banks and the practical side represented by the physicist Ian Donnely. The two of them have to figure out the situation and overcome the obstacle of lacking foundation, to communicate and understand the purpose of this unexpected visit. Both of them did a very good job, but Adams was the one who stole the show in this film, her breathtaking performance was not only the result of a well written character but also a great example of her unique talent.Just by looking at this movie you can understand why it has been described by many as a masterpiece. Gorgeous looking image that will take your breath away, incredibly realistic special effects that turned imagination into reality and perfect use of camerawork to capture the every necessary detail. Whether it is an alien symbol on a wall or a character's facial expression, Villeneuve will give the most breathtaking shot to maximize the impact, a free masterclass from a great director on how to portray a meaningful story in the best way possible.Science Fiction was always an underrated genre and many people seem to hesitate giving it a chance. Arrival is the movie to convince even the toughest crowd that Sci-Fi films can be as poetic as any genre. Through slow-paced well-written plot, meaningful characters and important messages Arrival is what art should be in these days, not a cool looking movie made by a commite, but a story that reflects on reality better than any down-to-earth drama ever could, a way to express the biggest questions and answers about life.Conclusion:Arrival might not be the best sci-fi film of the decade but it's definetely among the best ones, it's a piece of art worth mentioning that will not only make you think about life, but also it will give you an emotional journey that you will never forget. Movies like this should be released more often and since this is just a hope that might never happen, give Arrival the chance it deserves to amaze you.Rating: 9/10"
" Beautiful exploration of the choices we make
",0.7003,0.9654,2020-12-21 00:00:00,10,"Arrival isn't the kind of sci-fi that features starship battles or superheroes; it's the kind of sci-fi that makes you think, and brings awe and wonder to the seemingly small moments in our lives.Amy Adams is Louise Banks, a language professor hired by the military to communicate with aliens hovering in a dozen enormous vessels around the world. It's about first contact, but without the magic of ""universal translators"" - finding a way to communicate is hard and delicate work. Over the course of this work, Louise begins to understand life the way the aliens do, and it affects an important decision about her own path. Any more detail than that would be a spoiler; just know that the ending of this movie is emotional, bittersweet, thought-provoking, and deeply exhilarating.It's also a visually astounding movie. The first view inside the alien vessel is both minimalist and richly textured, and their written language is a gentle swirl of light and dark. The score by Icelandic composer Johann Johannsen is bookended by Max Richter's gorgeous ""On the Nature of Daylight.""Overall I can't recommend this movie enough - definitely in my top10 movies of all time, and #1 in science fiction."

It seems like you're being amazed for being one of those few people who are able to be there, and investigate about such a phenomenon. It feels that realistic, which makes it even more intriguing and fascinating. This movie does a more than perfect job of making the audience actively ask questions with actual interest, but it isn't so great about answering them. Why are the aliens there? The answer is given to us but it feels kind of nonsensical and stupid from a screenwriting standpoint. If only the ending wasn't so bad... This could've been a 10 so it's frustrating. It is worth it though."

Louise the linguist and Ian the scientist goes into the shell thru a shaft in which there's no gravity and beyond a colorless glasslike things are there the two aliens aka the heptapods. Louise took off the suit and talked to them as they wrote nondirectional script of theirs. They deciphered it later and at some point a bunch of soldiers attacked the shaft thinking they're a threat to humanity. Then only Louise was taken into the shell by a vehicle separated from it and Louise got on it and was among them right behind the glass. One of them was almost dead and it said the language they speak gives them the ability to see the future just like Louise as the daughter Hannah she has and lost to cancer was actually someone from the future of hers and she's having visions of her. She will be married to Ian and had Hannah. She called the Chinese army man in charge and said the last words of his wife. And then they disappeared instantly leaving a white cloud behind them. and Ian proposed to her in the field and they lived the future that Louise already had glimpses of. It was at the first part very tense and scary the first contact and the shell itself along with the way how they ascended in the shaft without gravity but the ending is a bit anticlimactic.

The real acheivment in this film was sustaining the tone of the central premis and the visuals - without stagnating the experience. The choice of the colour palette, chosen by the Director is correct - but requires very strong stroylines and timing by the Actors to keep the narratibve engaging - otherwise you can drift into 3rd rate Tarkovsky.

I didn't watch the trailers at all, I avoided the spoilers, and the film went in a completely different direction from my expectations. And he totally surprised me and impressed me. A SF film with minimal use of CGI these days certainly deserves applause. The focus is on the story and the protagonists. The film is the total opposite of Independence Day. And then there's the plot twist, which I didn't even think of, and which is why you look at the whole movie with different eyes. Denise, every part of this accomplishment, bow to the floor. For all those who say that films are not made today as before, they obviously did not look at this top achievement. And now I wonder, isn't this the meaning of film, ie film experience? Don't watch 34 trailers that either reveal too much and ruin the viewing or misrepresent the movie and ruin the viewing. Watch visually beautiful movies, but put the emphasis on the characters and the story, not the effects. That feeling when you watch a movie and even a few days after that you think about it. I think that's the real point."
" Super annoying, most disappointing film of the year if not decade
",-0.3167,-0.9411,2020-11-19 00:00:00,1,"There was a time when SciFi was an exciting genre. Sadly, that era ended with Contact. Since then audiences are treated to Transformers, Interstellar, Battleship and, yes: Arrival, the ""intellectual"" nothingburger and masterclass in boredom and pseudo science. There's not a single character anyone cares about. Forest Whitaker, Jeremy Renner... good actors but completely wasted here. Amy Adams and that fixation with her daughter in particular is super annoying. The plot is ridiculous. Someone must have thought that putting linguistics at the centre of the story would be smart. It could be, but Arrival fails spectacularly. 12 spaceships are landing on earth and we are supposed to believe that the octopus aliens are just waiting for Amy Adams to figure out what they are trying to say. The bottom line is, this is all horrendous, flat and unexciting. 1 star for the worst film of the year. And that's without factoring in this horrible noise that passes as ""original soundtrack"". Good lord."

The most action comes when the good guys (us) almost blast away the star for making a phone call - that is exactly right, she was making a phone call (don't worry - they hold their fire)! Why did the aliens come to Earth? Answer: because they have a favor to ask of us in 3,000 years. And what did we get in return? The ability to predict the future. And why does it take 12 alien spacecraft to deliver this message? The movie gives no answer. Hell, they could have posted that on Twitter. The aliens themselves look like over-grown octopuses.
The acting is pedestrian and the writing is so-so. And when we do take on the aliens what do they use? SMALL ARMS! I mean, really, we've got a lot better stuff than that. The general should have been sacked on the spot. And they didn't exactly bust the CGI budget on this looser - the spaceship looked like a spoiled jalapeno."

Do not be fooled by bad ratings or reviews for Arrival. I know this is a snob approach to rating a film but I am happy to be a snob here.
It reminds of Lost in Translation many years ago. I sat there, enjoyed it and loved the atmosphere of the film whilst I had bitterly disappointed dads with their kids sitting and waiting for Bill Murray antics and gags.
It is the same here and I get it. Anyone who expects the typical Sci-Fi formula and action will be disappointed.
Arrival is Sci-Fi, but on a whole different level. It is beautiful storytelling, about the human spirit, about what might happen when we meet other life forms, about the ability to think, to love, to look at life from a different perspective.
Absolutely magnificent."

It has some very interesting ideas and concepts but it fails mostly because of one thing in my opinion and that's time travel. Any movie that uses time travel as an essential plot point has to be very particular with the rules to make me engage with that aspect. I did not engage with this movie's version at all. In fact, all the intrigue and drama it had built up just fell flat as soon as the concept of going back and forth in time was introduced and I lost all engagement with the movie.May be different for you as it seems is for the rest of the reviewers that are giving it a 10/10 but it's just not for me. A shame since I was really looking forward to how things were going to go. In any case, it is probably worth watching but it is a very slow and weird movie.I hope more movies like this are made favorably without an element of time-travel (Interstellar is another one that lost me because of that)."

",-0.1531,-0.9659,2020-10-18 00:00:00,6,"This movie was close to being good but ended up falling short. First off, the movie had exceptional cinematography, acting and an interesting premise. That was the good. Unfortunately, there was a lot of bad in this movie as well. The whole premise that language can suddenly make you see the future, was both underutilized and makes no sense. I don't care what language you speak, there is no way possible you can use a language to help you see in the future, because it literally hasn't happened yet. I understand the language hypothesis, but I still don't buy it. The future thing was also underutilized. Amy Adams could only see up to her child dying. Could she see beyond her death, up to her death? What about 3000 years later, could she see what was going to happen?My other problem, aside from the plothole, was the fact that the movie didn't know what it wanted to be. Is this movie an Alien take over movie which is about human civilization or is it a deep movie about family and living life? In the end, I had no idea because the movie was so all over the place. At one point civilization has come together and she is explaining the Alien language and at the other Renner is whispering 'let's make a baby' into her ear and their playing with their kid. What is the message in this movie? If it is that Aliens can bring us together, why include the child part and if it is to live our life the same even if we know the future why include the alien part?I didn't find the movie boring as some others have suggested and I thought it kept things interesting even if it was simple at times. Also, I saw the Jeremy Renner being her husband coming from a mile away (around when it was revealed she hadn't already had the child).For the major plothole and the mixed theme I give this movie a 6/10"

(I'm really looking forward to his interpretation of Dune!)I must point out the incredible and majestic one-take shot of the protagonists arriving to the place the ,Arrival' happend, in which Villeneuve presents us in an over 2min long, no talking one-shot, one of the (in my eyes) best ,First visual Contact' scenes ever made. Captivating sound and atmosphere! Brilliantly executed!This rather calm Sci-Fi movie is low paced with a lot subtile elements. The storyline itself is actually not complex on the surface, but has a highly complex and philosophical idea in its core! This makes it a multiple watch movie that demands way more from the audience than the average flick.It has good but no groundbreaking performances by the actors, but built in an all around great atmospheric environment, they are believable as well as their behavior.All together a MUST for experienced and demanding Sci-Fi watchers and a fantastic opportunity for everybody else to see a movie from the true genre of Science-Fiction!"

It definitely influenced me to study about the fascinatiing world of linguistics. By the way, it has a good message about solidarity and union among us beyond nationalities, especially in these days which are marked by regressive ideas across the world. Not even the ongoing pandemic seems to make us think in a different perspective, I mean, as Humankind."

The ending is remarkable as it re-construct the whole story in a totally different perspective. I am so amazed what the ending did to my surprise. It's totally unpredictable.Anyway I don't really feel fit about the concept of the alien in this movie, I think it's quite absurd. An alien supposed to be an intelligent creature with sophisticated technology, but the movie just provides an octopus-like alien with magical power.Had it not due to the absurdity of the alien, I would have given a perfect score, it's just 9/10 from me. Well done."

If you're expecting blockbuster action, or an epic space saga, then this might not be for you. But if you're looking for something mature, philosophical, and suspenseful, you'll love it. Villeneuve has a talent for creating wonderful stretches of tension with the well-written dialogue. The attention to realism, from the initial social and military response to their arrival, to the motives and histories of the characters, are all very well done. The pacing is wonderful, as is the exploration of time. The music is nicely chosen as well, and really adds to the meaning of the movie. I would definitely put Villeneuve among my favourite directors (along with Nolan and Cameron). If you enjoy mature and philosophical movies and science fiction, you'll enjoy this."

You have to pay close attention to every word, and consider the possibility that anything could mean something entirely different. Keep studying and analyzing every detail throughout the movie, then the real story will come together in the end. If a distraction caused you to miss just one event or one line of dialogue, you might never understand what's really happening. And the scrambled timeline in this movie adds to the challenge. I did not fully understand the story until I had watched it a couple times. This is one of the greatest movies ever made, but half the audience disliked it because they expect to be entertained the way other movies do. This movie doesn't do that. It makes you work for it."

Original story is actually very interesting science fiction, exploring one intriguing physics principle, which got me thinking for days. I wouldn't consider this film a waster of my time just because I heard about this story because of it.
But film itself absolutely and miserably fails to show beauty of original premise. It absurdly mutilate original plot, and without basic idea explained or even mentioned it looks just stupid and doesn't have any sense.It looks like movie makers couldn't understand science principle behind original, but they were told to copy all the aftermath, so that's what they did without any thinking and logic.

The makers may not have been accurate but the project looks convincing, unique and beautiful.It's a heartfelt, very engaging and brilliant piece of art, which needs to be watched and admired time and again. Denise is one of those filmmakers who takes phenomenal projects and delivers his best, and of course which makes the movie viewing experience stellar and to the next level. I especially was astonished by the last 15 minutes of the movie, the movie left me with an awe, speechlessness and pleasantly surprised. I loved the movie even more than my first movie viewing experience. The theme, the narrative and screenplay aligns with the production team and overall projects becomes a beautiful movie.
What did not work:
Maybe some scenes were cliche such as global conflicts, the characters and their perceptions making it glorified, which I am not complaining but if I had the change I will take out some of them. It's not a complain but a suggestion.

" Modern Science Fiction masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9709,2020-08-16 00:00:00,10,"Arrival was directed by Dennis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whittaker. When 12 alien spaceships land on Earth, linguist Louis Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly are recruited by the U.S. Government to find out the intentions of the aliens. They attempt to decode the complex alien language amid escalating international and domestic tensions. I think that it should be included in the pantheon of great science fiction films. While packed with complex ideas and themes, Arrival is also a deeply emotional and contemplative movie. Amy Adams is great in the lead role. She excellently depicts the wonder and shock that her character experiences. The musical score is also brilliant in heightening the complex emotions experienced by the characters. Most of the movie is deliberately paced with long-takes and wide shots showcasing the beauty and the immensity of the aliens. The film expertly connects communication, language, time and human existence in a thoroughly absorbing experience. One of the best movies of the decade."
" Arrival. (2016)
",0.0,0.4588,2020-08-12 00:00:00,10,Clever science fiction film with an Oscar-worthy Amy Adams who skillfully tells a story that makes the viewer think and asks the question: What would you do yourself in the situation?
" a movie that will make you feel nervous and intense BUT, I expected more.
",-0.1027,0.9988,2020-08-12 00:00:00,8,"Arrival is a movie that will make you feel nervous and intense BUT, I expected more.Arrival is a movie that I really enjoyed, the first act of the movie made me excited, want to see more and want to know what will happen at the end, to be more specific, I wanted an answer to the question ""why are they here?"", and the first act builds that so well.Amy Adams' (plays: Dr. Louise Banks) performance was absolutely incredible and so powerful, loved her character and her acting was amazing, her face expressions, body language, and her eyes are everything, she was acting with everything. Forest Whitaker (Plays: Colonel Weber) was also amazing, very cool performance that surprised me. Jeremy Renner's character (Ian Donnelly) was so useless, even the character said that in one of the scenes, he said that he is nothing without Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and she is the one who is doing everything.The directing was so amazing wasn't surprised that Denis Villeneuve was nominated for an Oscar.The cinematography and colors were so amazing, especially that shot when we first see the aliens aircraft, the incredible long take encompassing the entire area with the fog surrounding it, loved it so much. One thing that grabbed my attention is the whole ""color tone"", the off white-ish color that is dark, gives u that feeling of fear, feeling of confusion of why these aliens are here, it was just amazing and really loved it so much.The music was so cool, it builds a lot of emotions inside of you.the production design was so beautiful and simple, deserved an Oscar nomination.The sound editing and sound mixing were two things that were really powerful and although I didn't watch that movie on the big screen with all the sound effects that are in the theatre, but it was still a thing that was so amazing and grabbed my attention.Arrival is a movie that is not the best but also not the worst, the 3rd act or to be specific; the ending makes you want to watch the movie again and makes you think about the movie from its beginning. A great story with a great directing, cinematography and production design but felt like it could've been way better but i for sure recommend it.My rating is: 8/10"
" One of, if not my favourite Sci-fi film
",0.0,0.8557,2020-08-09 00:00:00,10,"So glad it took the overdone alien first contact action flick and added a realistic setting. Highly grounded in sci-fi is what makes this one of my favourite films.Rewatched it for the first, after 3 years. Remember vividly a lot of stuffs, one the few movies I used to constantly think about 3 years ago. Script is a masterpiece, way to tell that story in that way, beautiful. The concept of time travel seen in a new light.The soundtrack is addicting, was listening to it out loud and my mother told me to stop it because it felt like 'someone was dying', I replied HannaH.The cinematography of that first scene of spaceship was gorgeous. Many social commentary about conspiracy theory, majority of them were correct as we can see from pandemic. I actually gained a lot of respect for linguistics, always thought of it as a useless study area but boy was I wrong.Rewatching it, caught many foreshadowing. The movie literally says everything at the beginning.Loved the themes, her taking the decision of have that child. Its not about the goodbyes but the memories we make before the goodbyes. She would rather find & lost than never get it. The parallelism with one the heptapods(alien) dying yet the other one not caring because their time isn't linear, they could go back in memory.Script was smart to have that Chinese official scene, many will say it was plot convenience but I have head canon of her later telling the Chinese official to tell her everything later on, hence he had a line 'I don't know how your brain/memory works'The movie did answer why aliens came but it wasn't concerned with that, it was more about humanity and their perspective & memories. This is CINEMA.Type of movie I will end and sleep on thinking about it. The calm and eerie feeling filled me after the credits."

",0.0,-0.7667,2020-08-08 00:00:00,1,"I've been reading IMDB review for ages and made the effort to register solely to write this review, because there comes a point when you can't keep quiet and must say enough is enough.If there were an option to chose NO STARS, I would have. This is the first movie in my 63 years that I had simply could not watch after a few minutes trying. I thought there was something wrong with the film but after checking a few scenes at random, I have found out that alas, it was made unwatchable BY DESIGN >:-(Why, oh why did Denis Villeneuve think it was OK to underexpose his movie so severely you're constantly trying to make out what the scenes shows BECAUSE THEY ARE SO GODDAMN DARK?! After 2 minutes of this torture I could not stand it anymore. Thank God for Netflix, at least I didn't have to pay extra for watching this torture for the eyes.And I'm not saying that because I don't appreciate visual arts - I've been a photographer since early teens and use a $3,000 color calibrated graphics monitor on my PC with 10 bit IPS LCD and it's the first movie I ever I had to stop watching after just a few minutes - it's that painful to watch.For now I'll read the novel the movie was based on (Story of Your Life, by Ted Chiang), and hope a gamma corrected version of the movie comes out (like I hope someone will one day stabilize the Bourne movie series to remove camera shake to a bearable level). One can hope, right?This fad of making movies painful to watch is not new and in fact seems to be getting worse and is certainly going to be remembered as a 'dark' period in the history of movie making, because great movies are those that make themselves invisible to the point the viewer really believes he is in the story, and forcing the viewer to look for luminosity and contrast controls totally breaks this fundamental principle.It's too bad Denis Villeneuve made this decision, as his sequel to Bladerunner is the best sequel to any movie I've ever seen, a true masterpiece on its own."
" Interestingly different
",0.4019,0.4785,2020-08-06 00:00:00,8,"The best thing in this movie is the linguistic angle. The difficulty of communicating with a completely different lifeform is handled in quite a creative and intelligent manner. Also the way aliens and the ship are presented is also among the most believeable. No english speaking humans with a bump in forehead here. The time part of the storyline is unscientific and makes this less a scifi classic and more a fairytale. Military idiots did not need to be in this story. Does Hollywood have an oblication to put them in every film? The colonel (Forest Whitaker) is a refreshingly smart soldier though.Amy Adams excels in the leading role as the liguistics professor facing an almost impossible challenge. She's both strong and delicate in a way that captivates you all the way through.Overall my feelings of Arrival are mixed. What's good is really good, but the weaknesses are all the more frustrating."
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.6588,2020-08-06 00:00:00,9,"Denis Villeneuve won me over with this film. It is a masterpiece of science fiction that has a real emotional core. It is ostensibly about aliens and treats this subject matter carefully and without sensationalism. It explores topics like linguistics and time that are not often treated in these films. However, there is also the human element which ties into the twisted timelines and it really underpins the entire experience. The only thing I would give it fault for is the odd diversion with the soldiers' conspiracy theories - otherwise I would have rated this ten out of ten!"

" Arrival? More like Departure from Everything Good about Villeneuve
",0.6901,0.9977,2020-07-28 00:00:00,4,"If you like having exposition crammed down your throat by two comically inept academics, you will love Arrival.It's one of those films that tells you all about science and life, but only does this by relying on the complete ineptitude and gullibility of its audience. If you have never met a linguist, you will love the way this film depicts them. They're simple, really. They look at words, and then they try to figure out what they mean. However, in pressure-filled situations, where it would be imperative for them to really understand a new language, they implement the amazing strategy of standing around and telling each other how linguistics works. This is a fantastic technique in case anyone happened to be spying on them who didn't have any common sense.Plus - Arrival also features one of those classic anthropocentric plots that audiences ate up in Interstellar. If you like cosmically significant sci-fi stories that somehow always manage to mostly be about one character's relationship with their child, this film will scratch that itch too!Arrival comes at the departure of the last breath of dignity that north american film audiences ever managed to breathe. It truly is a masterpiece of vapid blast-you-in-the-face blockbuster cliches. The diversity of scenes and the artistic nuances will dazzle and amaze you. From Amy Adams staring into the middle distance with a thin depth of field, to Amy Adams staring into the middle distance with swelling background music, this film really features every angle of Amy Adams almost crying that audiences could ever want.And if that wasn't enough, the rest of film is dripping with sentimentality too. It you're one of the great many lemmings in this world, Arrival invites you wholeheartedly to listen for it's subtle hints to *cry! cry you fool! the world is filled with obvious tragedy and sadness!* and to revel as the tears well up in your pristine lemming face. It gives you no reason to feel these feelings, just the general sense that they are appropriate, and a couple of flashbacks involving a child to make it really hit home.You know, the only truly sad thing is that this film features amazing concepts, amazing actors, amazing sets, and amazing effects. I mean that in all seriousness. Yet, the whole thing is ruined by a barren script, monotone directing, and cinematography at the level of your average indie youtube film. Whoever nominated Villeneuve for that Oscar must have either been an ancient astronaut theorist, or perpetually high.And I take no pleasure in saying this because most of Villeneuve's other work is so promising. Enemy was genuinely amazing and innovative, and Incendies was top-tier filmmaking. But the greatest among us fall the hardest. And I fear that Arrival may ironically signal the departure of everything I love about Villeneuve's work. Hopefully Dune sees a return to his roots."

Arrival released a couple of years ago, I remember I watched it first on Plane from Istanbul to Frankfurt and was to tired to follow.
Now we have the year 2020, the corona lockdown gave us more time than we need to finish our watchlist and so it was time for Arrival.
it is not easy to tell how brilliant this movie is without Spoiler anything.
The music is deeply sad and lovable combined with the pictures and the arty storytelling of Dennis Villeneuve it will suck you right in and you have no chance of release before the end credits roll over your TV screen.
I know the most of us expect a ScFi flick with Aliens and Soldiers and saving the world stuff like so many times before, but here is much more under the surface.
It is a melodramatic palindrome that will you make think days after you have watched it, and delivers a powerful message about the importance of Communication.
Time is non-linear as this picture portrays.
In it's all simplicity it gives you an infinite possibility of past, present and future.
This is one of the rare movies that we are all so fortunate to experience, sometimes the best pictures are the ones that require us thinking more than sheer entertainment.Just beautiful, magnificent and tragic...

There's only two noteworthy characters and our protagonist is moody throughout the film. And the scenery is always dark.

The processing of the subject is slower, there is almost no action, even this is enough to separate it from other films.I have to admit that I was very confused when I was watching the movie, I had difficulty understanding, you really need to focus on the movie because it is already mixed.not from action space movies it was more scientifically approached.
The timelines in the film may sometimes make it boring to make the film beautiful, but also complicated because it is slow but acting and the information we learned will be the reason for us to continue the movie.Denis Villeneuve loves space-related movies after this movie, he shot the Blade Runner 2049 and it was really good even that movie had a completely different style and now I am waiting with agreement for the Dune movie."

The movie follows the book closely enough, with just enough additional plot developed masterly by Eric Heisserer into a screenplay that gave Dennis Villeneuve more than enough material to showcase his exceptional talent, and Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker to show us one more time how good the actors they truly are (especially Ms Adams - what a wonderful, awe-inspiring performance!). The cinematography is one of the highlights of the movie, word ""impeccable"" comes to mind. Editing, light and sound effects - perfect. In other words, all elements of this movie are in a perfect sync.In closing: I respect everyone's opinion and if one hated this movie, I understand it. HOWEVER, I wouldn't go see Superman vs Batman and post 1 star review on IMDB afterwards, but that's me: my life is too short to be wasted on bad cinema. But if I do not understand a movie, as many of those who hated Arrival obviously did not, I would try to at least stay away from the keyboard.

" Arrival - 81
",0.0,0.94,2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,"""Arrival"" is a charged, very fascinating and with small means very exciting drama thriller. The film addresses difficult but interesting philosophical questions about ourselves and our existence in time. Villeneuve does not value to use a different narrative approach and, like parallel portrayal of the story and what it wants to say in a clever and seemingly complicated, but ultimately completely understandable and incredibly thought-provoking way.Sometimes the tempo drops somewhat, but my interest remains constant and even though some hasty simplifications of the story are delivered towards the end, the whole still holds up to the end very high class."

" Movie with a unique theme
",0.0,-0.3071,2020-06-09 00:00:00,10,Arrival is perhaps arguably one of the best made sci fi movie of the decade. The theme the movie conveys seems to be mind blowing.The movie not only tells us about the gift but also the fear that incites upon humans on seeing an unknown thing...
" Close but not enough
",0.0,0.6195,2020-06-08 00:00:00,7,"A very well made film. The main idea is new and there's a mixture between philosophy and Sci-Fi. The events are fast so you get easily hooked by the movie. However, at the end, you might feel that you need more explanation."
" Pretty mediocre in my opinion

You should really pay attention to details throughout the movie, this will make the end even more interesting."
" Phenomenal
",0.0,0.9521,2020-06-05 00:00:00,10,"This was one of, if not the, best movies I've ever seen. For a film with little action its incredibly enthralling. The story could not have been more beautiful. To me it's about love, life, and understanding. Loving to its fullest without fear of the heartaches or pain that may come from it. Living in the moment and appreciating every second of it. And understanding that all life, regardless of how near or far from our planet, regardless of species or language or skin color or creed or religion, are all connected. The future of our species is in the hands of our present, and with compassion and understanding we can make that future a better one."
" Just amazing...
",0.0,0.8106,2020-05-30 00:00:00,9,"Screenwriter Eric Heisserer originally read this science fiction story. It had a profound effect on him, and he pushed for it to be made into a movie.I can see why. This is a great story. The idea of a human first contact story with aliens is incredibly hard to make. We have some many pre concieved ideas about it, its sort of corny, there are really limited things that can happen...are we dealing with rubber aliens, etc.Despite this, the movie is a complex story, about human emotion, love, family, and humanity.Amy adams, Jeremy Renner are both excellent in this, expecially Adams, the film largely centres on her. There are limited sets locales, but the drama and intensity carries throught.If you like thought provoking, challenging science fiction, this is for you. If you want something else, probably go and see independance day."

I have avoided it for years because I am not a fan of movies you need to be on mushrooms to understand (intersteller). This is not that. This was well thought out, well acted, breathtaking. I loved the ""this is a world problem"" approach. Amy and Hawkeye do a great job here. See this movie!"
" Fermat's principle
",0.0,0.9917,2020-05-29 00:00:00,8,"""Arrival"" is different from the general science fiction movies. It flows on the level of objects and the objective world, and innovatively expands the field to the level of human consciousness, cognition and spirit.The setting of the story is based on a hypothesis of linguistics-Sapir-Woolf hypothesis. This hypothesis connects language with thinking, and believes that the language used by a person affects his cognition and way of thinking subtly. The ""English thinking"" of the English learning institution in real life may find a trace here. English is the main sentence with the main sentence, and the branch is the branching branch of the branch. Nesting, the difference in the essential characteristics of this language, may affect the way of thinking of different peoples.Louise, the heroine of ""Arrival"", is a top linguist, changing the way she perceives the world while learning the language ""seven languages"" of the alien ""seven limbs"". ""Seven languages"" is different from any language on earth. Our language is a linear structure, which determines that we must listen to or read a whole sentence in order to know the meaning of this sentence. Seven-language is a non-linear ring structure language, that is, the language of ""God's perspective"", from The two-dimensional level extends to the three-dimensional or even four-dimensional level. There is no strict causal logic and order, and it is a ""lake"" composed of sentences and words.Seven-language users are not constrained by linear time, and can stand on a high place overlooking the time, just like a writer who understands the cause, process, climax, and ending of the entire film; the writer is well aware of his novel structure and characters. The female lead gained spoilers for her life because she learned the seven languages, and foresees her life early.This kind of foresight is certainly good: she saw her husband 's tender chestnut eyes in advance, and heard the intimate love words when drinking tango; she saw in advance the soft braided braids, a pair of small dimples filled with sweet, will With a pair of small hands squeezing the plasticine, and using a wonderful pen to graffiti the little girl with the child's naive and casual style painting, she feels the beauty of love in advance, the comfort of a mother, the joy of growing up with children.This kind of foresight also carries tragic cruelty: her daughter has turned into a bare bone that is pale and almost transparent under the white cloth of the bed because of an incurable genetic disease; her husband who was informed of her daughter 's ending in advance is angry and helpless Choose to leave Louise early to escape the fate of her daughter's death.Here is a serious philosophical question for the viewer: if you foresee every step of your life, will you choose to change? The smallness of the individual and the force majeure of destiny intermingle, creating an irreversible deep tragedy, just as the prophecy of King Oedipus 's father and his mother marrying him. Every struggling and hard work in his life is just to let himself slide towards each step The preset ending; the curse of the sleeping beauty who was pierced by the spindle and fell asleep, and the foolproof protection still has a gap for fate to enter. Since the efforts cannot be changed, many people choose to escape like their husbands, and it is not shameful to escape, but it is absolutely respectable to be brave and frank.Louise's line at the end of the movie is very touching: ""Despite knowing the journey, and where it leads, I embrace it, and I welcome every moment."" Even though I already know this journey and its destination, I still greet it and greet it Every minute per second.The film's original novel ""The Story of Your Life"" is alternately narrated in the first and second person, as if Louise is sitting by her daughter's bed, with a peaceful smile, telling her the story of her life. The deep tension and timeless humor contained in the lines of the words make readers can't help but respect the woman who knows her destiny but does not escape and elegantly goes to the appointment.The end of each life can't escape from the incinerator into ashes, and wait for decay in the soil. From the beginning, we know the certain ending of death, but will the fertilized egg use this as a reason to escape the initial split? Regardless of whether the ending is separation or death, we treat the characters that appear in life with the most fierce sincerity. We take every step calmly, embrace every minute and second, and walk gently to death."

It is just so beautiful, sad, yet hopeful, and ultimately uplifting. By this point, Denis Villeneuve could film paint drying and I will be there for it. He can do no wrong in my book, as he just made a magnificent symphony of visuals and sounds, aided by a breathtaking performance by Amy Adams that was criminally under appreciated. And just as powerful was the use of music in this film especially the brilliant Max Richter's piece ""On the Nature of Daylight"" which is employed from the first scene and throughout the film fitting like hand a glove. There is no question in my mind that Arrival is my favorite film of 2016, and one of my favorite films of all time."

I never seen an alien movie like this. Full of suspense and mystery. This isn't a slasher but the fear and intrigue this movie creates won't allow you to move your pupil .
Arrival has some great establishing shots with a classy and captivating bgm score ,i remember one scene when they firstly encounter with the mysterious aliens, great.
It is different kind of alien movie ,believe me if you haven't watched it you should.

" Convoluted film
",0.0,0.8568,2020-05-24 00:00:00,5,"I love science fiction, but I found this movie hard to follow and overly long. How can one two-person team figure out the alien language in that short of time? Granted, in the beginning they were part of 12 different teams working and sharing, but all of their team's ideas came to fruition when no other team's did?The time-travel thing was put there only to expedite the ending of the movie. It made for an interesting ending, but come on now - only Louis is able to do it, plus she's able to be in the present and the future at the same time? That's a stretch I don't believe in.Louis disobeys orders over and over again. yet this military-run project lets her continue to do so. In the middle there was a scene where the ""shift"" was over, yet she went into the staging area without permission and made the movie's major breakthrough while our own troops were firing on each other. Another unbelievable premise.The aliens were interesting. It was like that Star Trek episode where Picard and an alien culture almost come to war until he figures out that they speak in metaphors."

Truly a film I wish I'd never watched. Great cast, hopelessly water on a meandering story will very little to endear it to anyone with any live if Sci-Fi."
" Author fiction
",0.0,0.9682,2020-05-23 00:00:00,10,"Often science fiction movies dealing with the arrival of aliens to Earth show this fact as a war or invasion, falling in both cases into a highly hackneyed and simple story.
However, 'Arrival' is totally away from this paradigm, portraying the visit of aliens in a much more realistic and human way. This is accomplished by putting the focus on communication rather than invasion. And Denis Villeneuve, who has proven to be one of the best science fiction directors of the last decade, approaches this story in a very personal way, from his own point of view. In this way, he not only demonstrates his mastery of directing, but also shows that science fiction cinema can also be author cinema. Without falling into the pressure of pleasing the audience and expressing a vision of their own.
It is very likely that 'Arrival' is one of the best science fiction movies of the last decade, not for its artistic way of staging a premise explored countless times, but for reinventing the way of seeing the tapes of aliens. For this reason it is not wrong to affirm that this film is a masterpiece of science fiction."
" This movie will not satisfy everyone
",-0.357,0.8563,2020-05-21 00:00:00,8,"Arrival is a science fiction movie directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg, Mark O'Brien and Tzi Ma.This movie will always be remembered for a rock solid performance of Amy Adams. The movie is based on Louise Banks played by Amy Adams who is a linguistics expert, she must interpret the language of Aliens who have came in a mysterious spaceship at 12 different locations in the world.This is another confusing and complex movie with complicated screenplay. There are many directors who want to make such complicated movies but it's not that easy but in this case the director is successful in doing so. He had left some clues in the movie and given the viewers the option to crack the mystery.Many viewers might be disappointed by the movie but as I mentioned that this movie will not satisfy everyone.Acting is great and Amy Adams is the show stealer. Jeremy Renner was equally impressive. Screenplay is slow and can get very slow so patience is the key to watch this movie.The climax of the movie is also complicated but ends on a strong note."
" Powerful movie that transcends sci-fi tropes
",0.4215,-0.8214,2020-05-20 00:00:00,10,"This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time, and shows me that sci-fi doesn't always need to be about the tech or the alien - this film is ultimately about language and how we communicate with each other, especially during a crisis or in the face of something world-changing and deeply unknown. I will always cry at the end of this film, because it's also about a woman confronting a difficult decision, even if she knows the consequences of it, which is so deeply human and powerfully set with the backdrop of sci-fi."

The language of aliens is like the idle pen of Oriental ink, like fog and smoke. All meanings are instantly presented and dissipated. It tells about communication and isolation. We are all trapped in a certain kind of self righteous civilization and prejudice. It calls for communication and communication, and it breaks down time. It's not so much science fiction as philosophy."

Nothing really ever happens. The movie is totally unrealistic in many ways.

" Brilliant Movie
",0.5859,0.9962,2020-05-09 00:00:00,8,"If you're looking for a tense, unsettling and powerfully atmospheric sci-fi complete with stunning visuals, enthralling drama and mind-blowing thrills, then look no further than Annihilation. With his signature style, director Denis Villeneuve creates an absolute masterpiece with this film, providing not only a visually beautiful sci-fi, but also a film with such ingenuity, and such an affecting atmosphere that your eyes will be glued to the screen at every moment.There's so much about this movie that will send shivers down your spine, but the majority of that can be attributed to just how powerful an atmosphere is created throughout every single moment. Much like his previous work Denis is able to craft a both elegant yet powerfully unsettling vibe around the entire film, and in tandem with the film's jaw-dropping visuals, there's something so affecting about the film that you can't get away from at any point, pulling you further and further into the bizarre and mysterious world being created before your very eyes.What's even more impressive is how the film manages to combine various genres in a both innovative and cohesive manner. Its sci-fi elements take centre stage throughout, but alongside that, there's a distinctive haunted house-style vibe surrounding the scientists' journey into the ""craft"", creating great tension that far surpasses typical horror movies, and makes for an even more thrilling watch throughout, as you feel deeply unsettled by the potential for danger in this new world alongside the wonders and marvels that have been created.And then on top of that, the film does a brilliant job of being an engrossing character-based drama as well. Although not all of the main group of five are as interesting as one another, Amy Adams's character is indeed a riveting lead, bringing emotional depth to the story as well as an endless curiosity that makes what would normally seem like stupid horror movie decisions feel a lot more understandable, and much easier to relate to.In all truth, I won't say that Annihilation is on the same cerebral level as the likes of Ex Machina or Annihilation, but the way it goes about its story, at its core a conventional adventure into the unknown, with such bold ingenuity and endless imagination is absolutely stunning to watch from beginning to end.From beginning to end, the film is powerfully unsettling, even featuring what I can call one of the most stunningly disturbing scenes ever put to film, but it's still an entertaining and engrossing watch throughout, thanks to beautiful visuals at every moment, engrossing characters, a very strong lead performance from Natalie Portman both on a physical and emotional level, and brilliant tension and sci-fi intrigue that will definitely have your jaw on the floor come the end."
" Nice movie
",0.4215,0.6597,2020-05-07 00:00:00,7,"I like... its a good movie with a creative plot HUMAN communication is a tricky proposition. Even assuming that folks share the same language-out of the over 6,500 languages currently spoken on this planet-the chances for misstatements and misunderstandings are shockingly high. In texts, emails, phone calls, video conferences, and even face-to-face, people manage to blow their chances to meaningfully connect with their own species more frequently than any of us would like to admit.But what if you weren't trying to communicate with another human, but rather with a completely alien species from another planet? This is an issue science fiction has considered for a very long time. And yet, when it comes to film, first-contact communication has generally been, to use an American vernacular phrase, a piece of cake."
" Interesting premise, poor movie
",-0.1027,0.409,2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,"Many sci-fi movies have a high brow premise that seems entirely unbelievable. Arrival did much better on this front and I was drawn in by an interesting and original idea. Unfortunately, some of the performances and screen writing almost drove me away. Almost every conversation felt forced and scripted. All military characters were portrayed as idiots with a lust for combat. Some of the lines that were meant to be forceful came out flat and seemed misplaced. The score, cinematography, and special effects were a bright spot.The last 20 minutes of the movie were engaging, but I'm sorry to say I almost stopped watching during the first 10."

Even if it's a problem for you, just cuts few points. Don't give 1/10Anyway, I think this movie was one best movies in last years and maybe even better than the Interstellar. If you like Interstellar stuff, It's really for you, except spaceship and stuff.The story itself is really mind blowing. Right after finishing the movie, you finding yourself thinking what you just watched. You start thinking and jump from branch to branch relate to what you just watch like movie in 'Butterfly Effect'But I think best part of the movie is that it plot. I mean how scenes are line up and how plot is making a smooth climbing to the top. It doesn't give you too much information at the end, or it doesn't keep everything to the end.Just right amount.Great movie, must watch it."
" An exceptional and revelatory sci-fi film that leaves its impact long after the film is finished
",0.0,0.9899,2020-04-25 00:00:00,8,"First and foremost Arrival strives at providing a riveting, complex and unconventional story (written by Denis Villeneuve and Eric Heisserer) for the genre itself that brings along many intertwined elements, whilst simultaneously grounding the story in enough realism to portray it's ideology and messages effectively to communicate with the viewer. At the forefront of the film, Amy Adams as the linguist Louise Banks is incredible as it is relatable, highlighting her already seen talent in her possible career best performance.The soundtrack and audio are masterful, with the use of diegetic and non-diegetic sound providing much of the atmosphere and ambiguity in the film. The soundtrack and sound design entangle in an almost grey area that leaves the viewer wondering the source of what they're listening to, ultimately making the Aliens feel more real and alive as a result. Moreover, the orchestral pieces spread out across the film provide the viewer with an emotional touch for Louis and her experiences throughout the film, bringing the viewer closer to the character and to the contemplative nature of the film and it's broader themes of time and memory.Finally the cinematography (completed by Bradford Young) is alluring and magnificent, and paints the picture of the scenes within the film beautifully and elegantly with awareness of contributing to building the world, characters and story. Young's masterful approach elevates the story with newfound emotion, typically with the shots of Louise contemplating the mortality of her own daughter Hannah. Furthermore, Young's impressive genius at portraying this world through a lens continues with the use of softness and distinction within the lines and the characters of the film. This creates the notion or notion of a portrait within the movie, that of which the characters and their memories are painted on. Ultimately, this is one of my personal favourite examples of cinematography within a film and one example that I will always bring up when asked about expertly curated cinematography.In conclusion, Arrival is a timeless piece of stunning and brilliant cinema that is relatable and heartfelt with its themes of how we communicate and are bonded together by our own memories and past, and the effect that can have in the span of our lives."

I am saying almost because I already have got the message of the movie really well so it was no point of me for watching other than respecting and loving the movie. The movie doesn't give away everything too easily and it creates a tension that we are not so used to in the movies and it works. It works as it is intended to.

Denis Villeneuve continues to impress his audience after Prisoners and Sicario (the latter I saw but not reviewed yet). The cinematography is what we expect Villeneuve's films to be like. It's stunning. The performances especially Amy Adam's performance. Don't go into the film excepting big laser battles and action because this is a slow-paced film. That's one little criticism I have with this film. It's a little slow. Also, the plot for some people may confuse people. It requires a second viewing upon first viewing. It took me a while to think about this review. Also, I can't stress enough how much this film reminds me of Shutter Island. I mean come on! They both use the same song ""On the Nature of Daylight"". The plots both seem familiar to each other. But hey, that's just my opinion. Overall, Arrival is a wonderfully directed film, with a great cast, and stunning production design.

" Worst Sci-Fi of all time.

Anyway, the whole movie tells a story of aliens who came to earth to give the ""gift"" of how to see future. The aliens can't talk our langue, but they do have their language of signs. The protagonist learns their language in time and somehow this makes her see future. Anyway the goverments want bomb the aliens, so protagonist stops them, she simply says something to war general which only he knows, but she only learns this by seing the future. It wouldn't ever happened unless she knew the future, which makes it a paradox, a very bad one, this is the worst cliche plot hole a time travel movie can make, so obviously this is a bad time travel movie. Also the whole movie protagonist sees future events 1. without firstly even knowing the language 2. At the end of movie it's supposed to be a plot twist (You were supposed to think it those were memories) but since those ""memories"" showed a child and a romance with the dude which she obviously during the film met for the first time and the fact that the child was never brought up to the plot or conversations in any way makes it was obvious that those ""memories"" were future seeing.Anyway this movie fails at everything, the characters are weak, whole movie is slow and boring and plot is so full of plot holes that this movie doesn't even deserve to be called a Science Fiction. One of the worst movies I've ever seen."
" Plenty to like but falls well short of greatness
",0.5267,0.88,2020-04-13 00:00:00,6,"While I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from watching Arrival, it didn't really capture my imagination in the way I had hoped. It's a reasonably engrossing watch but it kind of feels like a rehash of various different sci-fi films. There was very little about the plot, the visuals or the dialogue that I haven't seen before in some form or another. There was the alien landing, the media frenzy, the civil unrest, the stern military guys and the wise and noble central character who saves the day. Throw in a boring romance and some lazy stereotypes about China and Russia and you have yourselves a generic Hollywood blockbuster.The one element of the film that stands out is the storyline with Louise and her daughter. These scenes had genuine intrigue and emotion and were nicely incorporated into the main plot. The other big positive about Arrival was the performance by Amy Adams. Her role wasn't particularly challenging but she still offered a level of subtlety and delicacy that is so often lacking in films like this. It was a huge shame that Jeremy Renner was cast alongside her as he was laughably inept by comparison. It was also unfortunate to see Forest Whitaker given such a corny one-dimensional role knowing what he is capable of as an actor.Where the film went wrong was with the communication development between the humans and aliens. I won't go into detail on this as there are plenty of negative reviews that really labour the point, but it was unfeasible that things would progress the way they did. The conversation between Louise and Costello towards the end of the film was laughably corny and by this point I was just wanted it all to end.The alien genre is a difficult beast to tame and very few movies have done it well. Arrival promises a lot early on and was close to pulling it off but was let down badly by some lazy writing and weak characters."

The main focus is not on action and how they fight a superior race but on science and practical thinking. Aliens arrive on earth, what do we do? Communicate. Find solutions. Negotiate. People get scared, they demonstrate. Countries don't work together but work for themselves and some shout war way to early. Everything is so realistic and if you're interested in science, linguistics, what ifs and learning stuff this is your movie.
Obviously there is this twist and you could argue that it makes it less realistic but if there really are aliens on this earth, how is this more unrealistic than that. For all we know time is relative.
The movie also has a great message and all in all is the best scifi movie I've ever seen."

" The Power of Language
",0.0,0.9468,2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"There's a very old idea, that's also a constant theme of life seen throughout history. The idea that life involves a certain amount of suffering and that the best way to act in those circumstances is to accept that suffering willingly. These ideas have been carried across time into the future not only through language, but also through abstraction in the form of art, images and music. A good representation of this idea of the inevitable suffering that surrounds being is Mary holding her dead son, Jesus, in her arms. No mother should have to bear through this, but one of the most sacred images in the western world involves this representation. A good question would be why? Well, maybe it's that Mary literally embraces her suffering and does it willingly as well.Arrival shares many similar themes and I believe them to be a cornerstone of the film's message. Amy Adam's character, after she discovers, let's say, the eternal language, a language that if you understand it, it no longer involves seeing time as linear, she realizes her daughter will die of a rare disease when she's about a teenager. This is also a brilliant plot twist in the film, since we are expertly led to believe through most of it that her ideas about her daughter are from the past, and not from the future. Near the end of the film, she asks her future husband ""If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?"". To which Ian responds ""Maybe I'd say what I felt more often."" Now, Amy Adams' character at this point realizes that the imminent suffering of life is worth accepting, so she goes through with it, even though she knows that it will end in misery. But she also knows that the journey with her daughter and the memories created by that will be the thing that will transcend time, not the actual suffering created by her death.During the first act of the film, when both main characters meet for the first time, one of them being a linguist and the other being a physicist, sort of have the argument of ""The cornerstone of civilization isn't language, it's science."", explained by the theoretical physicist, played by Jeremy Renner. I think the film brilliantly proves his hypothesis to be wrong merely through the events that occur in the movie and without explicitly saying it with words. It becomes clear and more clear the more you get towards the end of the film that some problems cannot be solved through science, but through language and sometimes even that cannot be the case. Sometimes, only abstract representations, such as the symbols that the aliens create, can fully explain and maybe even solve a problem of communication.I think the entire movie is really something else, but the complete first act of the film, from the point it begins to when they have their first encounter with the aliens, that really is some next level film making and cinematography. Truly genius level directing by Villeneuve and photography by Bradford Young. They do an excellent job throughout, not just during the first act, of the will to face the unknown and to act as bravely as you possibly can in dire circumstances.Arrival is a brilliant film, one of my personal favorites and truly a statement of what can be achieved through filmmaking."

Just like the misunderstanding of communication caused by different languages and cultures, both sides are right, but they have different perceptions and conflict. If one party's cognition is too stubborn, and the other party's communication skills are not very strong, it will not be able to effectively communicate and collaborate, and even lead to a cold war or a real war.

They'll explain something complicated very fast and it doesn't give you much time to process what just happened before they move on to the next thing. It's like that matg teacher who after explaining a complicated concept asks ""Does everyone understand?"" and moves on even if only 1 kid said ""Yes."" The plot has a lot of subtle forshadowing, some of which came from supposedly throwaway lines that ended up being important later on. The twist at the end was very well concealed, although I would have liked them to explain the reasons for why this twist can happen. It was brilliant, but came out of nowhere.

Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use ""the weapon"".There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.Easily a 10/10"

",0.0,0.9609,2020-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Despite the sci-fi/alien appearance of Arrival, there are many aspects of human life addressed delicately in this movie.
Beside the incredible regard to ""language"" in our world and how much it can be important, complex and intertwined with our thoughts and dreams, I think the key feature of the movie, is that one dimension that we're still trying to crack up; TIME! The main question for our linguistic (Amy Adam's character), is not the matter of how to communicate with aliens, but rather how much she's going to change her life decisions when future is revealed to her? So, does it still worth to live through all the pain, when you know how it's going to end?Also, there were so many moments that I was just astonished by the amazing shots, like when the spaceships vanished into awesome clouds, that made me appreciate the CGI work behind this extraordinary movie very much.Like ""Sicario"" and ""Prisoners"", Denis Villeneuve successfully transferred stress and tension throughout the movie, yet without the guns and violence, and definitely didn't let me keep my eyes off the screen for a moment!

" One of the fresh, best and intelligent alien & sci-fi movie out there {criti-cally reviews}
",0.8591,0.9991,2020-03-14 00:00:00,10,"My ExpectationI had already heard a lot about this movie from my brother, Vishesh, as well as heard the huge amount of Oscars Nominations it had gotten. So I was already on board to watch it and excited to. But I had no idea how much more its going to be about. I was technically under the impressions it will be sci-fi action movie but it turned out to be something similar to Interstellar. Intelligent Sci-Fi. Sci-Fi and Drama.Prior to approaching this film, a word of warning that it is what many like to call a ""thinking person's sci-fi"". If you're going to watch this, I beg that you dedicate your utmost attention to it, as it is truly one rewarding experience, one of the smartest, most well-constructed science fiction marvels of recent years. 'Arrival' is Villeneuve's magnum opus.
Based on the ""The Story Of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang
My ReviewDenis Villeneuve blew up the cinematography experience with this movie. I didn't have words left to explain what happened. Only someone like Denis can create the thrill, suspense and tension with the camera, music and lighting, without even showing the actual aliens for as long as the first half of the movie.
The suspense and the tension created was probably one of the best part of the movie. Although based on a short story, the story wasn't anything long or complicated, but rather quite short and simple. Extending it, and that to beautifully for the screen the way he did requires a lot of talent. There is minimal use of computer generated images, and main focus on story, characters, acting and thrilling scenes. And that's the highlight of this movie. How to show aliens and their impact without showing them!In Arrival there is no action, no explosions, just some amazing acting performances combined with good directing, editing and cinematography. There was not a single moment I felt bored.The slow pacing of this film worked perfectly it helped to build up the slow burning suspense and gave the characters more time to be developed better. The special effects in this film are also fantastic mainly because they are used sparingly as it is clear that the focus is more on the characters. Denis Villeneuve did such an amazing job directing this film he really sucked you into the situation and made it seem more life like.This film asks a lot of questions about humanity and how it interacts and these questions are incredibly intriguing and thought provoking it forces the audience to think on real life and accurate the events of this film are to real life. The whole mystery of why the aliens are here is done perfectly you're more that likely to change your mind at least once and when a mystery like that is built up for so long it's hard to make the eventual discovery satisfying but in this case it was, the eventual reveal makes you look at this film in an entirely different way, the film also doesn't feel the need to answer every question it asks leaving certain things ambiguous that allows the viewer to think on their own answers.The acting by all the actors is simply mind-blowing and very natural and realistic acting. Overall, I'd recommend this movie to everyone as it is definitely once a watch and on a completely different theme in respect to aliens with a fresh and realistic story.How It Impacted MeWell first of all, I was deeply intrigued by the fact that language is what makes our reality what it is right now. The fact that a language defines how a person might think even! And the impact our language can have. Like we currently don't even have words to describe certain emotions or feelings we feel right now in English. And because we cannot define it, we cannot identify them when we do feel properly. If our language had words for it, we would be talking about those feelings and maybe addressing them too. Similarly the concept that the language can be non linear and can change our perspective of time being linear also. The concept is very deep and thought provoking and I just was really amazed by it."

" Words create reality
",0.2732,0.9823,2020-03-03 00:00:00,8,"I don't think this movie is about that ""what makes us human"". Personally I think it is about creating your own reality. The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (""For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned""). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully."

",0.6249,0.8716,2020-02-03 00:00:00,9,Super well-made and extremely interesting from start to finish. This is a really special movie.
" Sadly overrated, with a story that's full of holes *major spoilers*
",-0.4215,-0.8594,2020-02-02 00:00:00,6,"I became a fan of Denis Villeneuve after watching Enemy and especially Prisoners, and I liked Sicario. But with Arrival I am having serious second thoughts. Arrival is a movie that appears very profound and meaningful at first glance but completely falls flat if you stop and really think about it. It is a very stylish movie that does not depend on effects or spectacle to create emotional impact, I'll give it that. It also explores an interesting premise, that of a peaceful ""arrival"" by aliens that are so utterly unlike us. It also has that tense and unnerving atmosphere that Villeneuve does really well, even complete with a little scene reminiscent of Enemy's giant spider scene.Despite all that positivity, Arrival has to deserve this low score because its story's is riddled with huge flaws. It's full of holes, wholly implausible, and the movie has a clear problem with failure to communicate events, cause and effect and motivations.First of all, this movie has a ""scale"" and ""detachment"" problem that makes everything difficult to believe. We are told to believe that the events unfolding at the Montana alien site are the most important thing that has ever happened in human history, but there is not much to show for it. The whole military operation is maintained by a few hundred soldiers, commanded by a colonel, and there is one linguistic expert on site (Louise). The whole thing seems to exist in a vacuum. There is no correspondence with the president or any other sort of higher-ups that we can see. We see everything else that goes on in the world through TV and computer screens. There are eleven other similar alien arrival sites across the world, and the other countries are apparently attempting to communicate with them much like our own heroes, but we don't learn much of anything about this process, until contact gets cut off. We learn that order starts to break down in different countries, but as seen on TV this has little impact and little explanation as to why it's happening.The deciphering of the alien language makes up the crux of the story., and this process has a ""hard science"" feel to it. Except the movie completely fails to show exactly how this happens. There are literally NO concrete details as to how the initial (and most important) breakthrough is made. The scientists have a difficult and frustrating first few sessions, and then we are simply told in a montage that Louise has managed to teach the aliens the word for ""human"" and has started to make progress. This is a huge failure of the ""show don't tell"" principle, because we are in no way shown how this has happened. HOW did it happen? Later we are told that apparently at least two other countries - China and Russia - have managed to communicated with their aliens, China apparently with the help of a board game, but there are no real details on any of this.Later on, the aliens present what is apparently their whole language, and this is their ""gift"" to humanity, because - as beings that can perceive all of time at once - they have deduced that 3000 years later they will need humanity's help. Putting aside the implausability of entities that can perceive the past and the future at the same time existing as anything other than godlike beings, there are several problems with this. What exactly is their gift? Louise, after being taken aboard the spaceship, gains the ability to see into the future and this is how she deciphers the entirety of the language. She says that mastering the language enables one to gain the ability to see all time as one, but if this is true, many people would gain this ability after the publication of Louise's book in the future, but there is no indication of this having happened. How does this gift work? And why does anyone think it CAN work? Louise herself gained the ability not through deciphering the language but apparently through ""magical"" means while contacting the aliens, because her ""flashforwards"" start much earlier, but there is no explanation as to why this happens only to her and not the rest of the science team.In the movie's climax, as the various human militaries prepare to engage the aliens, the belligerent Chinese General Shang tells Louise in a flashforward scene how she convinced him to stand down by calling his private number and speaking to him his wife's dying words. Louise doesn't remember any of this, for some reason, so he shows her the number and tells her the words again. All of this is very much ""deus ex machina"" and makes zero sense when you stop to think about it. Louise not remembering the event seems to imply that is actually being ""created"" at that moment in the future in order to influence the past, and if so, it begs the question as to how the armies decided not to engage the aliens in the first place. It's classic time travel paradox. This is not even taking into consideration the implausability of all the nations suddenly deciding to come together just because some American scientist told a top Chinese general his wife's dying words in a phone call and then hung up.In order to illustrate Arrival's failings to communicate its plot points clearly I am going to highlight a particular scene: The bombing carried out by the ""rogue"" soldiers. It makes no sense. A few soldiers, apparently brainwashed by some conspiracy theory radio show host, decide to ""do something"" about the aliens. Their plan is to plant a meager amount of explosives on the spaceship, an amount that cannot in any way destroy the ship. What are their motivitations? What is this going to accomplish? How come a group of apparently hand-picked and elite troops manage to get duped into doing this by listening to a random radio program? We don't know.They plant the bombs, by coincidence at the same time as Louise and co decide to back up into the ship for another communication session, fail to stop the scientists, but then the aliens save them at the last minute, althougn one of them - ""Abbott""- is fatally injured. Exactly why beings that can see into the future fail to stop this happening before the last minute is unclear - except maybe for dramatic effect. This is especially more confusing for the alien who dies. Did he foresee his own death in the bombing, but simply chose to go along with it? Why? And to top it off, after this incident nobody in the military camp is making a big deal out of this, barely mentioning it when Louise asks about it. Except it's the biggest thing that has happened until that point and could end up literally destroying the world.(Sigh)And finally, I do like the tense atmosphere, but I don't like it when the only single emotion that the main character conveys for 95% of the movie is: ""tense"""
" Gorgeous, simple, meaningful.
",0.743,0.8671,2020-02-01 00:00:00,10,"I don't go for that many artsy films, nor ones with very little dialogue usually, although I loved Paris, Texas.However this film means so much to me. When my children were old enough I showed it to them also, and they were very absorbed by it and found it - eerily soothing or something.It's very hard to describe without spoilers but I thought it holds a mirror to the very best and very worst of humanity / universal life.I found the score very apt for the telling, and it just wrecks your heart a little and reminds us of some very important facts that it is so easy to forget in our short time here. I think it's especially relevant for us in these times of road rage.I read about 100 of the bad ones here, and have decided that most of the terrible reviews on this site about this film are from people that Did Not Get It or don't seem to have much of a spirit or soul. Which is tragic for them as it would have given them the reminders on what is life? that they needed.I strongly disagree that it is trying to be 2001, I found this a way more mature film.If you were the kind of teenager that could dangle your feet in a river during the pouring rain, then I recommend this beautiful and poignant film for you."
" Frustration and shame for all linguists
",-0.7351,-0.9773,2020-01-28 00:00:00,1,"I'm deeply frustrated with this movie. It seemed to be original, but they really missed it.Its main character is a linguist. Earth is visited by an unknown alien fleet that lands in a dozen places around the globe, just like in Independence Day. For some reason, they travel to Earth and land, open a hatch so humans are allowed to enter their ships, but aren't prepared to communicate with mankind at all, they just stay still.Louise is called to try to communicate with them. Everybody in the world were failing in any attempt, and all she has to do is show them a board with a word written on it, and they decide to also start providing writings. Haven't anybody on the world tried that before?!What really made me mad with this movie, is that together with her they called a mathematician. But he, instead of obviously asking to use basic math to communicate with them - it's believed to be the common universal language, that any intelligent life form would understand -, he tells her to ask them herself some complex math questions, like if they are able to travel faster than light. He looked so dumb, and was immediately forgotten in the plot.The ending is also very dumb. For no apparent reason, a chinese general decides to declare war against them and other countries to follow him, and she becomes a world hero just because she phones this general and convinces him to give up.That's it, seriously!"
" Best Sci Film unfairly treated by low IQ base
",0.4767,0.4791,2020-01-27 00:00:00,10,Not for a low IQ.Has a story line that has to be followed and is not an action film - it is these people who have given this film 1 stars. It's a philophilical film that can the potential to have a truth behind it.
" Great film
",0.6249,-0.5081,2020-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Perhaps, one of the most overlooked science-fiction films in the last 10 years.. Wonderful directing, acting and cinematography. Brought tears to my eyes because of parallels to our own family tragedy. 10/10!"
" Aliens with a plot
",0.0,0.1531,2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,Not your typical take on another alien invasion film. This movie had drama and a solid story to back everything up. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner give sold performances.
" Not a cliche Sci-fi film !
",0.0,0.9891,2020-01-19 00:00:00,8,"This film is much more sophisticated than any other movie in its genre. I love that it never really shows what the alien looks like, your imagination fills in the rest and honestly that is much scarier. Amy Adams is wonderful and I'm glad she got a few noms for this movie. Honestly, you really have to be in the right state of mind for this movie. It's a little more psychological, and there is a spin on time and the date the movie is happening in. I loved that the film was focused on communication and linguistics. It's hard to find an alien film without the entire plot being them trying to destroy the earth. Make sure you have your popcorn and have already been to the restroom, because you could get confused pretty easily if you miss something. It's a very different movie in fact I would say it's the sci-fi movie for people who really don't like sci-fi movies. Another thing I liked was the movie jumped right into the plot just minutes after it started. Over all I really liked the movie, though it might be a movie to just watch once for some."
" Nice Original Alien Invasion Film
",0.6249,0.9967,2020-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Arrival is basically a combination of Contact and Signs. It has the atmosphere and feel of Signs and the story of Contact. Though, I think it ends up being better than both those films. This is mainly due to the ending. Both Contact and Signs started out really interesting and engaging, but then started to lose it by the third act, and then the ending ruins it. With Signs the ending was just lame; with Contact the ending was both lame and confusing. With the amount of build-up this film gives us in the first and second acts the ending could have been a complete letdown just like those films were. Thankfully, this film does not drop the ball on the ending, which makes Arrival a cut above the rest. Despite that I would not call Arrival a phenomenon like most praise as. It's definitely a good movie, but I was not blown away by it.Like I said earlier, the story is very similar to contact where humanity finally has contact with alien visitors and the main character Louise, played by Amy Adams, is trying to find a way to decipher their language and communicate back to them. The differences that, unlike Contact where the characters are deciphering a message and we never actually see the aliens, here the extraterrestrials actually come to Earth and the humans communicate with them directly, which makes the film more visually interesting.The film also has a very gloomy atmosphere to it, very much like Signs or a Christopher Nolan film. If I did not know the director and people said Nolan directed this movie I would believe it, especially with the ending, which is something he would concoct.The movie looks great in spite of the gloomy atmosphere. The effects team did an amazing job with the visuals. The score, while not the most memorable, also did its job at setting the mood of the scene.The main thing about this film that prevents it from being a masterpiece for me is the characters. Amy Adams is fine but the rest of the cast I thought was lacking. The one thing Signs does better than this film and Contact, in my opinion, is the characters. I was invested in Mel Gibson and his family more than the cast in Arrival and Contact. You got good actors like Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, but their characters were rather bland. Jeremy Renner's character felt rather pointless in the film until the very end when his role becomes clear. Even so, the film does not make him a compelling character and his chemistry with Amy Adams felt a little forced.Plus, while you understand their importance by the end, there are many scenes that drag and drag down the pacing a little. Also, while the ending is good, there are a few scenes that feel odd or didn't really make sense with what the ending was going for, which I won't reveal to avoid spoilers. That's more of a nitpick, but it bugs me.Overall, if you enjoyed Signs and/or Contact, or even aspects of those films you'll like Arrival. If you like Interstellar, Inception, or just about anything directed by Christopher Nolan you'll enjoy Arrival. I'd say it's definitely one of, if not the best alien invasion film to come out in a long time. I didn't think it was spectacular like most did, but it's definitely solid."
" Sci-fi doesn't need lasers
",0.0,0.9849,2020-01-16 00:00:00,10,"There's so much to say about this movie. It combines a great story with well-executed and intentional filmmaking. The black and gray palette contrasted with the warm orange shows up so much you can't help but feel the way they want you to, as the emotion is literally in the colors. Its sounds are so perfect and powerful that they stick with you. They add so much to the film and are so much more than just a layer of soundtrack. The use of silence, deep bass, and the canary all show up repeatedly, and they set the tone for each scene without standing out. My only complaint is that some of the exposition is handled clumsily.
As far as conclusions go, the way it ramps up to the denouement is very powerful and one that leaves you thinking even after the movie ends. It's complex, but after it's explained, it makes sense.
I loved this movie. On the whole it's well made and the performances were brilliant. The twist and complexity are everything I can ask for in a movie. This is a must see for anyone."
" The best sci-fi movie I have ever seen
",0.6369,0.8625,2020-01-13 00:00:00,10,"I have watched this movie many times now. And I still love it. The perfect sci-fi for me. A movie about aliens that challenges humanitys linear thinking. I see some 1 point ratings in here. How can someone rate the acting and the story that low? Because ratings are like a-holes, everybody has got one. And the biggest a-holes only gives a 1."
" A MASTERPIECE
",0.6249,0.9952,2020-01-13 00:00:00,10,"SPOILER-FREEAttention to anyone who's planning on watching this movie. If you going into this expecting the movie to be like Independence Day, Edge of Tomorrow (a very good movie regarless), or Battleship, then you will be deeply disappointed. This is not your typical alien invasion movie filled with non-stop action, and a gun-toting protagonist
who shouts profanity and spout random pop culture references. But that's okay, it doesn't need to be that kind of movie. There's plenty of movies out there to fill that void. This movie is more closer to something like 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Interstellar. It is movie full of concepts that challenge our mind. Yet, it somehow display a bigger simple theme than most movie. And really, that where it shines best.I was already a fan of Denis Villeneuve ever since I saw Sicario (another movie with a female protagonist). Sicario was my favorite movie of his. That is, until Arrival arrived (pun intended). This was his first big budget movie and it definitely catapulted him to become today's top new Hollywood director (his next project is Blade Runner. The movie is a slow-paced drama. Imagine it being like an onion. Until all the layers are peeled off, you won't really know what's really going on. Sure, there are hints around (I managed to figure out what the plot is about almost a 3/4 of my viewing), most would really just be scratching their head throughout the movie. But
the events that take around during the final few scenes, or after you have figured out what exactly happens, it is one of the most satisfying scene ever. Yet, somehow it can make us feel even sadder. And might even us question some of these ""bigger picture"" concept.The movie proves that us humans have these fundamental programs built into our minds. We will always fear what we don't understand. It is a notion that we can't deny or escape. It also have a very simple theme, yet we can all agree that we haven't been able to fulfill that very theme throughout most of our entire human race existence. The concept of the main heavy subject is even more applaudable when it is compared with the same concept in Islam. It has almost the same idea. But with a more imaginative execution. It also managed to fill just enough space for a fanatic sci-fi to watch it again. The scene where they first enter the heptapod is one of the most memorable scenes in sci-fi movies recently. So there's definitely enough discussion provided for just about the most of us.The first and final scenes were very strong, emotionally. It made us not just sympathise with the characters, it also made us feel like we're there with them because the theme is very universal. How would you feel if you have the same knowledge as Amy Adams' character, Louise Banks? The technical part of the movie is sublime too. The cinematography is mostly consists of these ""a sight to behold"" shots. It doesn't rely too much on CGI. So it definitely will stand the test of time. The score (sountrack for those not familiar with the term) are also gripping and catchy when it needs to. Particular for the first and final scene. It definitely contributed to those few teary eyes.Ultimately, this a must watch movie for most of us except for the hardcore popcorn cookie-cutter movies fan. It deserved to be mentioned, praised, and rewatched again and again in the next few years. And the years after that."
" Don't trust any 1/10 or 10/10 reviews
",-0.4023,0.9134,2020-01-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie isn't a 10 but neither a 1, it's awesome but in the third act they kind of rushed the things.Amy Adams stills the best actress working today and the directing is good.

" A Film That Requires Thinking
",0.0,0.5844,2020-01-11 00:00:00,10,"Wow. I just reviewed a bunch of the ""1"" ratings. I find the low ratings are for a couple of reasons. One, it was a pure ""talkie."" No action and no threats from aliens. The other reason is, they didn't understand what was going on.When I originally saw this movie in the theater, I spent several minutes afterwards in the lobby explaining things to my friends (e.g., how Amy Adams kept seeing her future and how Amy learned from the alien that they do not experience time in a linear fashion). Some strangers came over to me to also hear my explanation and I realized how difficult it was to understand. I thought the best scene in the movie was when she's looking into her future and gathering information that she needs immediately in the present.I've probably seen the movie 4 times now, kinda' looking for ""nuances"" but mainly because it's among my favorite sci-fi/alien genre films.I guess the movie just isn't that everyone. It reminded me of Interstellar, which I also found somewhat confusing while watching it for the first time."

",0.6369,-0.2175,2020-01-07 00:00:00,10,"The first time I saw it I didn't understand it quiet well, but the second time I really really got stunned by it."
" WRITTEN BY ALIENS TO MIND-CONTROL US
",0.0,0.9627,2020-01-03 00:00:00,1,"This movie is so bad that there's only one way to make sense of it: it's written by aliens who have little understanding of humans but want to put us in a trance to mind-control us. So beware of their tricks!HYPNOSIS TECHNIQUES AND NARRATIVE DISCONNECTSLong, pointless montages of unimportant aspects of the story with an annoying single violin playing randomly in the foreground that force a cognitive dissonance -- and we wonder, ""Can this actually be important? It must be if it's emphasized like this. But it's so banal."" It makes one's stomach churn like a spinning computer wheel.A main story that is edited to leave out the most important parts, like a football broadcast that doesn't show the touchdowns or concert footage that doesn't show the band. For example, the translator's first encounter with the aliens and later her discovery of how to read the language are simply...left out. We're not supposed to notice that she simply starts to use a translation app that has magically appeared on her tablet as if the aliens got it approved on the app store.Too much time in general spent on unimportant aspects of the main narrative, like a chef who serves up an excellent steak dinner and talks to you at length about the color of the plate. A long montage at the end of the movie that forces us to endure supposedly meaningful scenes of a close relationship that for the rest of the movie has only been terse interchanges involving work, and which becomes as impactful as watching strangers kiss in the park.DISCONNECTED CHARACTERSPeople who don't talk to each other in normal language, but use unnaturally quick, staccato remarks as if they are mind-controlled aliens themselves. Interactions in which there is nothing beautiful or even moderately functional.
A linguist who can barely speak as the main character, who spends most of the movie muttering in half-whispers.LOGICAL DISCONNECTSAliens that make animal-like sounds while authorities bring in a linguist and not an an expert in animal communications, or at least someone who speaks Wookie or who has seen the whales in Star Trek IV. Kind of like a hockey team bringing in a soccer coach.Not giving a briefing or any training to the translator, as if one's first encounter with an alien species doesn't need that. An encounter team that is forced to wear awkward, loose plastic suits when over on the next hill a ski team is wearing state-of-the-art, skin-hugging protective fabrics. Forcing the team to go to meet the aliens immediately after they receive a broad-spectrum antibacterial vaccine as if the body doesn't need the required three days to integrate the formula and develop immunity, as if it's enough to take the vaccine for show.CONCLUSIONSo overall the effect is to create a trance that puts one's mind on spin, ready to receive the embedded commands from the off-planet intruders, or makes the mind resist so much that one doesn't know whether to keep watching or run away screaming.It's unfortunate, because the concept of the movie is good and the story introduces linguistic concepts that could have been explored more deeply.But at least if you watch The Arrival then the horrible series Another Life will suddenly seem like a work of art."

The presentation of the global response is ridiculous (China is a military dictatorship and the rest of the world is irrelevant with Russia being just more China.) The characters were as deep as kiddy pools. There was no basis for the actions which developed the plot (e.g the armed rebellion and bombing on the base which was excused with a single line from the doctor) Smarmy comments like the Sanskrit war verse and the Kangaroo line show that the researchers talked to one and no more than one actual linguist. This is not a sci-fi film because the connection between language and time manipulation is the opposite of scienctifically valid.

",0.6588,0.9958,2019-12-26 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen, and I'm old enough to have seen most of them. I feel sorry for those who call it boring because, if you truly were bored, you either didn't understand it, you have a short attention span and can only focus long enough to see movement and shiny things, or you have no feelings. Either way, you are disadvantaged and the poorer for missing out on appreciating one of the most profound films ever produced. Why is it such a good film? First, there are no films that defy being categorized like this one. Sure, it's called a science fiction but, honestly, its way more than that. In terms of a genre, it's actually a combination of a science fiction with squid monsters, an intellectual study on communication and how it might affect your thoughts and actions, an exploration into the nature of time and its perception, a commentary on human behavior and the state of mankind such as man's tendency to jump to conclusions and make rash decisions, a mystery to be solved, a romance, a story of great grief and loss and, finally and most importantly, a bitter sweet statement on the value and beauty of life, all life, even life that doesn't last that, in the end, includes everyone's life. Secondly, Arrival does all of these things very well and weaves each element together seamlessly into something beautiful and thought provoking. It makes a statement like a philosopher. Like a great poem or piece of art, it forces one to think, to wonder, to feel, to understand love, to feel grief and loss, to ponder what is and what is important. I'm richer for having seen it and I give credit to those who achieved it. I can't believe they were able to do it and to do it so well."

" An Intelligent Sci-fi Look at Communicating with Aliens
",0.4588,0.788,2019-10-26 00:00:00,8,"""Arrival"" depicts the arrival of multiple spaceships that land at various places on Earth (including Montana), and the resulting attempts of each nation where the ships have landed to communicate with the extraterrestrials and ascertain their intentions. The U.S. military authorities hire a Professor of Linguistics and a Professor of Theoretical Physics to identify the vocabulary and meaning of the aliens' strange language of complex visual configurations, and the linguist (Amy Adams) becomes the center of focus in this film. ""Arrival"" is decidedly not a ""space opera"" as it is a thoughtful, well-researched exploration of communication ""mediums"" between living beings who know nothing of each other. ""The day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) took the easy route by having the lone alien communicate in English (presumably picked up by monitoring radio traffic); ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" used musical notes to get the terrestrials and extraterrestrials in synch; Carl Sagan's ""Contact"" used a repeating sequence of prime numbers to signify a living intelligence (It is fun to note that the Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977 contained the ""Voyager Golden Records"" that contained, with much input from Sagan, mathematical formulas like the derivation of Pi, plus chemical structures, not to mention 55 ancient and modern languages).The Aliens do not apparently use a phonetic alphabet as their written language, featured in the film, is distinct from their spoken language. I have three final comments to make about this film: (1) I give intellectual heft to this film by its invoking the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, namely that the structure of a language determines how you think and experience the world. The Aliens' language moves in circles and thus they have a circular, not linear, view of time. The irony is that this hypothesis is now discredited by Noam Chomsky and modern linguists who argue that all languages have a common grammatical structure. But of course, who's to say how our extraterrestrials' brains evolved? (2) Why do these films, including ""Arrival,"" have military types who think early 21st century weaponry is sufficient to destroy creatures who are capable of interstellar travel? (3) For that matter, what on earth do these aliens, presumably so far advanced beyond our capabilities, think we could do for them in 3,000 years?"

I hated the protagonists, I was bored by the aliens, and the entire plot is just unbelievably dull and pointless. Nothing happens, ever. Now, a few things do happen, but it takes the script ages to tell them, and there is absolutely no emotional payoff to any of it. It's a self-indulgent moody video that seems to last forever, and poses as a film. Just pure drivel. But the worst thing is that in the third act, the film somehow takes a turn for the worse. Even worse than what came before. I find it hard to believe anyone in the audience didn't ask himself: 'Why am I watching this crap?'

So it relies on pretentious, pseudo-intellectual scripts loosely based on a mix of misunderstood sciences (in this case, linguistics) and poor metaphysics. This movie left me with the same impression as Interstellar, that is to say stupid, pretentious, failing in every aspect, and ultimately ridiculous. I won't bother to analyse all the script's nonsense, as it has been stated by other reviewers, but more importantly, nonsense is not even the question here. Nonsensical scripts or plot holes can make a good movie if it doesn't try to aim higher than what it is, and if it's well executed, both being not the case here.
Apparently, seeing the high ratings for these movies, people seem to appreciate this kind of garbage... Well, good for them, but I proudly stand in the minority who certainly don't."

This is a true love story. Not a romance, but as the Greek call it, Agape. The highest form of love. She knows how her story ends, but she chooses to relive her fate.I don't really want to give anything critical away here because this movie needs to be watched, and it needs to be felt. Anyone who has had pain, disappointments, or regrets, needs to watch this movie for its beautiful message, and enjoy it for what it is- a well made movie that is unique and beautiful in every way, something sorely lacking in Hollywood these days.One note: Max Richter's ""On The Nature of Daylight"" was perfectly utilized in this film, I truly do not think the moment it was used would not be as impactful if not for this beautiful song.

Toward the end, the linguist knowing a tiny piece of her future seems to be the story, but then that's not it either because it's just a scene or two and has zero connection to the other story themes (language, aliens, bombs), of which there are many. I went to this because I heard it was a profound story. But the supposed profound bit just sits there, disconnected from and underdeveloped as a coherent part of the story. This story was so pieced together it appears to have come from multiple authors who all have very, very different personalities and who couldn't agree what the story was about. So then the aliens take off and we learn almost nothing about them. What the heck?

Besides Adams' brilliant performance the whole movie is well balanced and never boring, smart at the point that forces you to think into it not just for a little more of the 2 hours needed to watch the movie.
I've read comments about time implication like ""hurr if alienz knewz teh future how come they couldn't think about a proper solution duh"".
I would love to shortly answer to this: first of all we have no idea of what the problem they'll need us to solve will be, so we have litterally no hint about if thr problem itself could ever be solved by aliens alone. Second of all the movie stands by the concept of a unique timeline so they knew both this story would've gone this way and that they would have behaved exactly like how they foresaw, because that's the huge implication over there. Given this info it comes naturally that she had no choice in having a baby with Ian because that is how timeline works in this story. Does timeline work like this in our universe? Well the question is far away from being solved but for sure this movie gives a great and mind blowing answer to this."

So refreshing to watch a film that makes you think, challenges you to figure it out. Very well written as well."
" Overall decent presentation, but completely illogical
",0.0,0.8958,2019-10-07 00:00:00,6,"The beginning of the Arrival is tense. It successfully evokes a fear of the unknown, emphasized by scenes shot with dark lighting, as well as beautiful cinematography. It's definitely an atmospheric, thought-provoking film with slow pacing - much like Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 in that regard. However, so many things don't make sense.One of the biggest problems is how stupidly aggressive governments around the world act in response to the aliens' arrival. This behavior is primarily shown through the perspective of the American military, which feels as if humanity is on the verge of extinction. Do you really think an alien civilization intelligent enough to come all the way to Earth would wipe us out for sport or, as suggested by one intentionally insufferable character, convince us to kill each other (which we do already)?They could've exterminated humanity long before we even knew what was coming, seeing as how they appeared out of nowhere and avoided initial detection. In particular, one scene with a rogue military unit blowing up a spacecraft (which defies the laws of physics - should give you an idea of how primitive humanity is by comparison) and killing one of the aliens is absolute nonsense. If there was any hope of fighting back, it already left the moment the aliens landed.This is where things get extremely complicated. After the aliens teach humanity their language and cause their perception of time to become nonlinear, Arrival is unclear on what that actually entails. If the past, present, and future all happen at once, then the cause/effect relationship doesn't exist, which means nothing can exist in any state. The phone call paradox scene could not exist either because a time travel element would have to be introduced, which is not possible according to the possible perception of time explained above.Furthermore, because the movie presents two perceived experiences of time (normal time and a learned, altered perception of time), logically one has to be the ""true nature"" of time. Both cannot be true. That leads me to the alternative, slightly more plausible option, in which case humanity becomes aware of time being predetermined after learning the alien's language. However, even if time was predetermined, the future still could not influence the past without a time travel element being introduced. This means, no matter which way you look at it, Arrival's story is impossible.In addition, while the while the flashbacks (later revealed to be flashforwards) are interestingly woven into the plot as a part of the main character's personal mystery, her story is ultimately simple and flat. She decides to have sex with the scientist because she remembers the future they have together, she has a kid with him even though she knew she would die of a rare disease, and he agrees to be with her even though he knew she would not tell him that she knew the kid would die, so that means he knew what he didn't know before he did not know it.If you're thinking, ""Wait a minute. That doesn't make sense at all!"", you're absolutely right. Throw some aliens into the plot and that's basically the entire story. There is no character development or romance to enhance it either - just a very simple plot, which makes you think way too hard, and a very beautiful presentation. Even if the movie did make sense, it would've been better with a deeper plot and some answers to the most profound questions it asks. Why do the aliens need help in 3,000 years? Where did they arrive from? Why do they need primitive humanity to save them if they're so advanced they can manipulate the laws of physics like gods? Alas, nothing is answered.Expanding upon the initial tension, Arrival honestly would've been better as a horror film."
" Arrival - So GOOD!!!
",0.7005,0.995,2019-10-04 00:00:00,9,"This movie is so good, it's hard to even summarize this review. Unlike other alien movies, this one takes a unique approach in which the life forms that have entered the universe are not here to take over or destroy, but to inform the main characters of there future, piecing together clues that we as viewers saw as just screen time. One thing I always harp on is how much I love movies that have some sort of twist or skewed perspective on the plot, much like shutter island (my favorite movie of all time). This is definitely the case here with Arrival.Seeing the characters interact with the octopus like creatures is very, well unsettling at first, as we don't get to really see them for a good portion of the movie. This movie focuses way more on the interaction and adaptation of both the aliens as well as the main characters, and how they develop away to understand the creatures way of communicating. The overall approach to the story we are given makes this movie worth it, but add in the amazing acting and character development, and you get yourself one of the best alien focused movies, in my opinion of course :)"
" Intelligent science fiction
",0.4588,0.9229,2019-10-02 00:00:00,10,"In the opening scenes we see protagonist Louise Banks raising and ultimately losing a daughter. We then see her lecturing in linguistics in a university; her class seems poorly attended but it soon emerges that there is a good reason for that... news is breaking of the arrival of twelve alien space ships. They are hovering at various points around the world just above the Earth's surface. Louise is approached by Colonel G.T. Weber of the US Military to help them try to communicate with the craft above Montana. Here she is teamed up with scientist Ian Donnelly. Upon entering the ship they meet two seven limbed aliens, dubbed 'heptopods'. It immediately becomes clear that their method of communication is unlike any human language. Gradually a basic vocabulary is developed; then a potentially worrying message is received... it may be an offer, or a threat or just a misunderstanding. Some countries take it as a threat and prepare to attack the crafts above their countries. If peace is to be maintained Louise and Ian will have to decipher the aliens' final message.If you are hoping for the sort of sci-fi that delivers lots of fasts moving action and sexy, almost human, aliens then you are in for a disappointment. If however you want an intelligent, ideas led story then you should watch this. Most science fiction conveniently avoids the problems of communication with ideas such as 'universal translators', 'translator microbes' of a fish you stick in your ear but this film is all about establishing communications. As such it moves at a fairly slow pace with much of the action set in drab rooms... this doesn't mean it was boring though; I was thoroughly engrossed and the twists, which I won't spoil, surprised me without being too convenient or irritating. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner impress as Louise and Ian and Forest Whitaker is solid in the role of Col. Weber. The rest of the cast is pretty good too. I feared that the ending might not live up to what went before but thankfully it did. Overall a great film that fans of more cerebral sci-fi need to watch... that's not meant as an insult to action packed space operas like 'Star Wars' or the high camp of 'Flash Gordon'; I love those as well!"

",0.4902,-0.946,2019-09-12 00:00:00,1,"This film had a good underlying idea but the execution was just frustrating. Here are just a few of them:1. The cameraman seemed to have left a blue-grey muslin cloth over the lens for the entire film. It was dark, muted, miserable, grey. Made you fed up before you had even seen 5 mins of it. The sun never shone. It was depressing and annoying.
2. What's with the heavy breathing, Amy? No-one else wearing a space suit had the need to inhale/exhale loudly the whole time as though they have just run 400m, but directors seems to think that this raises tension or shows that the character is at the limits of their endurance but for goodness sake, all she is doing is walking!
3. Other reviewers have mentioned many of the plot holes so I won't repeat them. But that whole bit about disconnecting from the other 11 sites with the screens all going down together was just daft, as was the aliens being so advanced yet unable to communcate the message they had come with (had they not thought of this before they came?) unless, by chance, a linguistic lady was able to, by some miracle never explained, interpret their circular smoke squiggles?
4. Mumbling. A perennial issue with American films. Forest Whittaker spots Jeremy Renner. ""Fergh ish blufl?"" he asks. ""Chauff"" replies Jeremy. ""Beturf eh wogue"" says Forest before ambling off. Huh? What did you guys just say? Rewinding and playing it back often doesn't help. Because they mumbled!! They seem to forget that there might be an audience straining to hear what they are saying. Annoying.
5. Acting. Amy Adams spent much of her time staring suddenly at the ground and making 'I've just thought of something ground-breaking' faces, before resuming whatever she was doing and revealing nothing. Jeremy Renner was hardly in it. Forest Whittaker just acted the tough guy, mumbled and bumbled around the place barking silly orders, and always looked as though he was really fed up and couldn't wait to get out of there. Perhaps because it was so dim and grey, who could blame him.There was a good film in there struggling to get out, but it didn't."

I expected to see HOW a linguist would develop communication with aliens.
But no, we didn't see any of that - we went straight from ""hello"" to a couple of hundred nouns (and at least 1 verb) with NO explanation of how.How could they possibly learn that a certain word meant ""tool/weapon"" ? Did she produce a hammer and say ""tool or weapon"" ? Did she produce every tool or weapon we have and repeat ""tool or weapon"" ? How could that word be ambiguous if we taught it to them ?But if they taught it to her - HOW ? Did the aliens produce every tool and weapon they had and repeat the word/symbol ""tool/weapon"" ? How could she make sense of various unknown objects described by an unknown word by alien beings ? How could she know that it WAS a tool or weapon ?Or how could they possibly understand what a hammer was ? Or whether the word refered to THAT object or its class (or its colour, or its use, or its handle, or its material.)

It is about the arrival of 12 alien ships in different parts of the planet and no one knows what they are here for. That's where linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) comes in. In order to know what the world is up against (or is in for), someone needs to ask the RIGHT questions and be able to understand CORRECTLY the answers they will give. It is important to highlight the need for clear communication because if we humans speaking the same language often end up in misunderstandings, what more with extraterrestrials that uses a different language.While the movie is enjoyable and thought-provoking, at best it can be considered as a paler version of Interstellar. First, it touches on the concept of time, how looking at it differently than the usual linear way that we do can make you look at things, and your life differently. Second, they had to change the original ending since Interstellar's arc already covered the concept of leaving earth for someplace else.As for the acting, I'm not sure if it's because of the story or the way it's written but lead stars Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner were underused but both were able to make the most out of what they're given.If I were to rank the last three sci-fi movies nominated for best picture, Gravity comes in first, the Martian second and Arrival for third place."

I can't remember characters names but forest whittakers (good actor) puts a recording of the Aliens in front of Amy Adams and says translate it, so the woman speaks alien gibberish fluently. My eyes were watering I laughed for about 4 minutes joking about it. The film takes itself really seriously but that was just dumb by accident. It won an Oscar for best sound editing a load of humming another cheap academy giveaway. I was laughing and I know what was happening with the story but it started annoying me at how they think its so clever all the way through but it isn't. Also everyone is entitled to their opinion but people giving it 10/10 just shows what has happened to the film industry. The quality has dropped so much there has not been a 10/10 since the dark knight. Just in terms of sci-fi people think it's as good as star wars V the empire strikes back Aliens etc REALLY.

I read the novella ""The Story of your Life"" and i loved it, but the movie adaptation leaves me weak and questioning my existence every time i watch it. From beginning to end, Amy Adams leaves me wondering what is coming next as her role as Louise. I'm feeling every emotion with her. The monotony she feels teaching, the annoyance she feels on the phone with her mom, the heartbreak of seeing what happens to her daughter, and the sense of astonishment when she meets the aliens. She carries the audience on her back in this movie. The rest of the cast is great, but Amy Adams is beyond anything I've ever seen before. Johan Johanson absolutely nailed the score and soundtrack. The aliens aren't overtly fake looking. The directing was divine. Everything in this movie is superb.

One disappointment: when they show an Arabic TV channel broadcasting, the Arabic language is written wrongly. I am not saying it didn't make sense, it was wrongly written. As this movie is talking about universal language, it disappoints me to see the mistake done here.

SPOILERS
i was worried this movie would have a vague abstract ending open to interpretation. when they started showing the play-dough alien and her teaching the language i started getting so confused, wondering if it was time travel and she was affecting the past. then, in one climactic moment, the reveal. i went from not knowing wth was going on to understanding everything perfectly. the twist brought me to tears from how awesome it was. everything made sense at that moment. and it was a more perfect and satisfying conclusion than anything i would have come up with. and as with all great twists, the movie is filled with hints at this twist. some of the hints seem so obvious now.this movie also has a lot you can discuss afterwards. like the reason she got divorced (presumably because she told him their daughter would die and he was upset that she didn't tell him beforehand because he wouldn't have gone through with it). and the concept that the language is circular, and it doesn't matter if you read it forwards or backwards. that parallels her ability to now see time differently, not linearly. it also relates to the daughter's name being a palindrome. hannahannahannah.She got married and had a baby knowing she would get divorced and lose the baby. I think that's the difference with seeing time all at once instead of linearly. The way we see time we would be sad at every moment after she died. The way the aliens look at time they see all of time at once so they always see that she died, but at the same time they always see every moment while she was alive and the love she provided. That's kind of like when people say I wouldn't have changed anything because I cherish the time we had together. Some people can handle it well, other people would rather not even deal with it if they could avoid the pain that comes after. But I think if we could remember everything equally instead of just remembering mostly the last thing that happened , it would change our mindfrom a whatsapp discussion:i watched it again. and i was thinking about @Adam Ata 's issue with the movie, about how the future is intended to be predetermined but in the movie she seems to have the decision on whether to proceed with having a child knowing it was going to die1) i think knowing the future and ""changing your mind"" is all included in the predetermined nature of time. so she ""chose"" to still have a child, but that can still be considered predetermined.... her as a being that can see all of time will always choose to still have the child based on who she is2) i think your issue is based on still looking at time linearly, it's hard for our brains to comprehend how time would work if we can see all of it at once. you can still have a predetermined world even if you can see all of time. your predetermined actions incorporate your ability to see all of time.the best example i can give is the two aliens, abbot and costello, one of them knew he was going to die, but he still ""chose"" to go for whatever reasons (like the betterment of his species). if he didn't have it in him to sacrifice himself, he would have never been there in teh first placenot sure if i'm explaining it right, but it all works in my head, and it's fascinating. i think i'm bumping it to a 9/10. such a great movielinear mentality = time travel paradox (she needs to see the future to solve something now, but that future wouldn't have happened if she didn't see it in the first place) this happened..... which caused this to happen, and then this....circular mentality = it all happens at once, everything affects everything elsefor example, a person suffers a tragedy and it changes who they are moving forward (linear). but with seeing all time, even stuff you experience in teh future affects you as a person nowyep, definitely changing to a 9. fascinating to think aboutOne little tidbit someone pointed out in a analysis video was that since they know they will need human help in 3000 years, that means these creatures live at least that long in order to see memories that far in the future. So the one who knowingly sacrificed himself, it's even a bigger sacrifice for them when they normally live so longAdam: there was no reason for them to change the daughters death to cancer other than the to ruin it and make it more paletable for the masses. in the book, she does of a rock climbing accident. then you think, why not skip rock climbing that day if she knows she's going to die thag day. because they couldn't change the future. everything already happened. it was just unfolding. anyone who seriously likes this movie should read slaughterhouse 5. that is no doubt where they got this idea from (its a really important book), and it does 100 times more with the premise than arrival didMe: She still had a choice of not having a baby. I think that's much better for the story. Because obviously if it was a rock climbing accident you wouldn't let her go. And even with not letting her go it would still work in the predetermined nature I explainedAdam: no she didn't have a choice. that's the point. it was all predeterminedMe: Predetermined including the ability to see all time. Then it still worksAdam: but the cancer thing gave them a way out of the haed questionsMe: The way you're describing is so boring and unimaginativeAdam: she could think she had a choice, but she didnt. she already saw it. it's a shallow movie considering what it could have veenMe: I strongly disagree. And I think your issue is that you're still thinking about it linearly. Everything affects everything. Including the future affecting nowAdam: I'm the only one not thinking abiut it lineaely. the choices she made already happened ""before"". they all happened at once. there is no before and afterMe: You are thinking linearly. Because you are saying seeing the future shouldn't allow you to change something now. But there is no future or now. Everything happens always and everything is affected by all of itAdam: Garbo movie. you can't keep saying I am thinking about it linearly. Garbo movie. that was the whole point of the movie. she can't change anything. when you see time all at once, she knew thatMe: What she saw happen in the future is what was going to happen no matter what, and that was her seeing the future and deciding what to doAdam: it's like the old Macbeth Shakespeare plays. he sees the prophecy but they still come true when he tries to avoid itMe: As weird as it sounds, everything being predetermined doesn't mean that we don't have choices. The choices we make are part of that predetermination. We will always make that decision. But it's still a decisionAdam: sure. but then why change the rock climbing to cancer if not to create some doubt to that end. people didn't want to see a story where people had no free will. and you can call what they had free will, but it still doesn't change the fact that the choices they made were still predeterminedMe: Because in the way I'm describing it would never make sense for her to let her go rock climbing. The alien who sacrificed himself did so knowingly. But no one is going to let their daughter die so she can have fun weekend. So they changed the decision to whether or not she will have the baby which is a much better decision. Definitely way more interesting than oh we just randomly do stuff and have no control over itAdam: the point is all the decisons were the same. all of them were predetermined. you don't change one decison for another. I think original way was more interesting and thought provokingMe: And I think the original way is super boring and useless.Without any kind of time travel, predetermination is a cool idea, everything you do and everything you experience affects what you're going to do next and you have no choice over it. Now apply that to being able to see all of time, it's still predetermined but based on much more information. Rather than only what has happened to you in the past nowIf Amy Adams was the kind of person who would decide not to have a child because it was going to die, then she would have never seen the future memories and it would have not been a decision either way. Her decision was always going to happen. Yet it was still her decisionI love this discussion. I love movies. The more I try to convince you, the more it makes sense to me"

The cast, while small, works incredibly well together and creates some awesome chemistry. The soundtrack is a crazy orchestral soundtrack that creates a duper dramatic feeling for most scenes. The end of the movie deals with some really complex conceptual sci-fi kind of stuff but instead of treating it like an actual sci-fi it instead takes on this much more serious tone. I feel like the main character deteriorates by the end of the film in comparison to her start as well. Solid but generally not quite compelling enough to draw in the audience."

The epiphanies/flash backs had a lot of mystery and played a puzzle that you tried to piece together.The special effects and soundtrack were perfect for this movie. It also had an ending that was original and memorable. Nothing like I can remember for a sci fi movie. I waste way too many hours these days watching somewhat decent movies only to be left with the director and screen writers not knowing how to give a movie a solid ending.For the time, space travel, e.t.s, science, etc. it has been ages since Hollywood has come out with anything that comes close to making me feel it all could be somewhat believable. My other example off the top of my head would be the movie Contact.You have movies like Arrival and then on the other end of the spectrum you have movies like The Transformers series and Armageddon. This one is going to be hard to beat when it come to the technicalities that make a great sci fi movie.

" One of the best science fiction films this decade has to offer
",0.6369,0.9863,2019-06-10 00:00:00,10,"Denis Villeneuve has proven himself as one of the great modern directors after movies like ""Prisoners"" along with this movie and others of his that I'm just flat out dying to see like ""Sicario"" and ""Blade Runner: 2049"" and on top of that this movie is one of 2016's very best. This is no ordinary movie about aliens where we learn to love them and want to be their friends such as in Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."" have shown us or a movie that makes us want to be scared to death of them like ""Alien"" or ""Aliens"" , but it is a movie that makes us uncertain and curious as to what they want to do to us and why they're here on Earth in the first place. The movie stars Amy Adams in a top notch performance that was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar nomination as Louise Banks a linguistics professor who along with the rest of the world learns that 12 mysterious alien ships have touched down on 12 different locations around the globe and is recruited by an Army Colonel (Forest Whitaker) to find out what their purpose is on this planet mainly because she has a top secret security clearance. She then is taken into a helicopter to go to the site where they will find the alien ship and on her team is a man named Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) who she develops a close relationship with on the mission. During the first scenes in the movie while I was waiting for the aliens to appear I felt the same feeling I had waiting for the shark in ""Jaws"" but only this movie isn't as suspenseful. Villeneuve is a director who really knows what he is doing behind the camera and really knows how to get strong performances from his actors whether it's Hugh Jackman in ""Prisoners"" or Amy Adams in this movie. The movie is one of the very best science fiction movies I have ever seen along with ""Inception"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""ET"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""the ""Star Wars"" films and more.

Judging by the hype here, I really hope some reviewers are getting paid because the alternative is depressing. There is an excellent premise; aliens come to earth but how on earth to communicate? The film is somewhat marred by dumbing down. The conversations are monosyllabic and the technical linguistics oversimplified. The sentimental effect of constantly jumping back to a dying child is an example of how Hollywood is hopeless at emotion.. Everything has to be hammered home with dull thuds of a sledgehammer. There is a dubious reference to time travel or something something about time being linear... There is quite a lot of confused continuity regarding what's happening in the holding Bay... Were those boxes of explosives supposed to be used? How did she get general Shang 's phone number and why did she not remember calling him thus saving the world? This could have been good..."

Many hate it, many love it...more so than most films. The reason, I think, is because this sci-fi film is very cerebral....and not a bit like ""Star Wars"" and more traditional science fiction.In this story, 12 enormous space craft suddenly appear all over the world. Not surprisingly, folks are scared and people want answers. Soon, a representative from the military shows up and requests that Dr. Banks (Amy Adams) join with a team of researchers in the American west....as they want her with her impressive linguistic skills to try to communicate with the vessel and the creatures within...if there are any. What follows is a long, slow and mend-bending film...one that is interesting and appears very realistic...but also is cerebral.The acting, special effects and all were very nice. I have no complaints about that at all. As for the story, I generally enjoyed it but felt that the whole concept of time being cyclical a bit strange....not bad, just odd. Overall, a good film but one that doubtless leaves many confused and bored."

I was so captivated by the plot, tension and cliff hanger that my body was physically stunned rendering my incapable of moving. I waited through the entire credits before I could turn to look my friends in the eyes and simple say ""wow!"". I was happy to see that the not only did I not leave, but the entire audience was as shocked as I was. I stumbled out of my seat with a feeling that life was no longer going to be the same. An absolute masterpiece. 11/10.

Action wasn't constant, but when there was action, it was meaningful. Plenty of cut scenes kept the story stimulating, with a heart warming, aswell as strangely terrifying undertone.The film wasn't traditionally scary, but had a real aura of fear of the unknown, which brought things to an amazing watch.

The scenes showing the child made little sense, ie. how is this related to the aliens? ---but the background main storyline wasn't really too affected by it. When I went back and saw it again though, it all snapped into focus! The aliens had an almost extra dimensional understanding of time and several mentions were made about language having a profound effect on our world view. When the main character learns the language, she begins to see events and time in a completely different way. For example, it can be said that humans see time as a linear construct; time is a book that we can see only one page at a time. The heptapods taught her to see the entire story all at once. Every scene and all the dialogue pointed to this, but it was obscured by our limited understanding of higher dimensional concepts. Pretty cool way to introduce another way of thinking about cinematic possibilities."

",-0.3182,-0.9115,2019-04-16 00:00:00,2,"I do love science and science fiction.
But i had to stop the movie after 40 minutes.
Usually I always say: you need to finish watching the movie to be able to judge it.
But not this time.
This time, it was just so boring I couldn't find any reason to finish watching it.
Unoriginal story.
Illogical dialogues (the starting dialogue when the main protagonist is hired is one example, already mentioned by many other reviewers here).
Ugly special effects.
The ""spaceship"" has the typical minimalistic, unimaginative design used when there is no budget nor thought gone to its design.
It doesn't make sense, like many other things of this movie.
I imagine the conversation that the writers had when they came up with its design: ""how do we design the spacecraft? Nahh, the typical flying saucer is so cliche, let's make it look like a huge egg or bean instead. We can draw it with a quick 1$ graphics design job, doesn't need to look realistic. Doesn't need to show any mechanical parts, just a flat surface.""
Same thing goes to the aliens design.
Oh, and I do always love when the scenes cut just before some cool thing is going to happen. Really shows how much the movie has to offer.
The color palette, is so dark and depressing. Colors are cold and washed out.
I was wondering if my screen brightness had turned down for some reason.
Turning screen brightness up doesn't help - the film brightness is just too dark, that you can barely distinguish characters from background in most of the scenes shot in dark areas.Overall, a boring movie, made even worse by its depressing palette."
" A thoughtful, haunting take on a familiar story - with layers to explore
",0.128,0.9949,2019-04-15 00:00:00,9,"I didn't realise this was such a dark film. Seeing it in the cinema on release I had been so overwhelmed by the sound, the cinematography and Amy Adams's mesmeric performance that this passed me by. I'm not talking about tone, of course; this films ends in a place of hope and invitation. I mean in light levels. Most - or all? - of the exterior scenes of the film take place in shadows, or with the sun evidently just one side of the horizon or the other. Interiors are low lit also; I notice two exceptions - the spotlight shone from a helicopter in to Amy Adams's face when Forest Whitaker returns to pick her up in the early stages of the story, the second towards the film's end, when the whole screen is bathed in white smoke as one character goes behind the screen that had separated people from the alien visitors up to that point. It all points to a person - and a human race - living in the half-light of partial understanding; unaware that there's a light that can be turned on until someone (or something else) does it instead.In many respects this film tells a familiar story of alien first contact with earth, and tells it as a thoughtful drama rather than an action spectacular. Like many science-fiction stories, this is one concerned with how we as a species and as individuals understand ourselves, and how we conceive of 'the other' - whether that's people or beings different to us, or God. It's certainly the case that even on the small screen this is a film that's deeply effective in evoking a sense of wonder; it may only be just over 30 minutes in to the film when we first see the aliens, but the lighting, the camera's repeated reminding us of Amy Adams's aloneness, the sound design and the remarkable score all evoke a sense of encounter with something that is truly different, alien in every sense of the word.Amy Adams's performance is towering; she seems to be on screen for at least 95% of the run time; for much of that time we seem to be following her from behind or looking in to her face, a face blessed with the ability to express volumes. This film was always going to stand or fall on her performance; as a result, it stands very tall indeed.The film initially sets itself up as a struggle between science (in the shape of Jeremy Renner's character, a theoretical physicist) and language (Amy Adams); but it becomes more than that. Breakthrough in communication with the aliens is only achieved when Adams, followed by Renner, break out of the strict, rigid almost ritualistic structures laid down by science and the military; maybe it's because I'm a priest and I was watching it in Holy Week, that I saw more than a hint of a reference to the curtain in the temple, separating people from God, through which only one priest could go and which was torn in two by Jesus' crucifixion.There's something in that, however. So often words and laboratories, religion and science, mind and heart are pitted against each other. In Arrival we see the fruit of something else; something the film calls a 'non-zero sum' game, a movement beyond linear, binary thinking in to something more fluid, more supple. If moving beyond the boundaries laid down by military and science gives humanity a breakthrough in communicating with the aliens, it's a departure from conventional 'zero sum', straight line thinking that is the key to the whole mystery and crisis that forms the heart of the film.Like Arthur C Clarke's classic 1950s novel Childhood's End (clearly an influence on both this film and its source text), the vision of humanity presented could easily be something so optimistic and naive as to be of no use. Certainly that's where Childhood's End left me; but I felt differently on rewatching Arrival. Of course, right and wrong, truth and falsehood and many others are binaries we need - too much blurring of the lines leaves with an epidemic of uncertainty and fake news. This time around, however, I was reminded of how I characterise my own thinking as someone with ADD and two learning disabilities; not neuro-typical, I guess you would say. I say that I don't think in straight lines; I think in blobs. Then I try to string the blobs together, make connections in order to form coherent thought and output (or not ... ). Straight lines can be helpful; but I find it very difficult to follow them.A valuing of intuitive, relational thinking can also make us a bit more humble, a little less keen to make it all about us. Especially useful when it comes to the 'other' - the other person, culture, lifestyle or God. Trying to build bridges with something or someone utterly different to us needs more than a straight line-rationale; it needs a humble willingness to take the long, winding road of presence, listening and submission. When it comes to God, it comes with the awareness that we can't build the bridge ourselves; we have to accept that all our rationality will only get us so far, and instead accept the invitation to the humble submission of walking across a bridge which we had no hand in building - and which for much of the time, we can't see the other side of, or even much more than a step or two in front of us.Arrival, in the form of Amy Adams's portrayal of a linguistics expert learning a new of way of speaking and thinking, presents us with a humbling invitation to engagement with others and the Other; a vision which requires us to step beyond the straight lines we naturally default to, a commitment to the long and winding road of another's design. It is in the letting go that we take up, the losing that we find, the dying that we live."

" Skip this movie and listen to the film score soundtrack instead.
",0.0,0.9922,2019-04-03 00:00:00,3,"I like Amy Adams as an actress she is good at her job, her movies are not brilliant in my opinion and Arrival is no different.I give this movie a 3/10 rating because there are some positive elements, the film score (half of it) is very good, the score by Johann Johannsson is different, it's experimental, catchy and unique, I have yet to become bored of the film score as I listen to it a lot on Spotify, not all of it is great, but there are some tracks that I love.The other positive elements to this film are the decent performances and the atmosphere, this flick is very open, atmospheric and spacious, example the house that belongs to Amy Adam's character is very modern and is set in the middle of nowhere, the rest of the flick has wide open spaces, I like this type of cinematography. Cinematographer Bradford Young and Director Denis Villeneuve did a great job with that.The story line of this alien flick is different than many other alien movies, Arrival is very serious and makes it clear that this is not one of those Sci-Fi comedies, Arrival is definitely a Sci-Fi Drama Thriller.As an animal lover, I did not like the scenario with the bird in the cage, there are also many other things wrong with this movie. Many people may not agree with me, and that's their right, but I will still stand by my opinions.As a Christian, I believe in the Bible and the Bible makes it clear that there are only 2 kingdoms, God's Kingdom and Satan's Kingdom. You could say ""It's just a movie"", but as a strong in faith Christian, my faith can't help but intervene when I watch some secular movies.We see things from Linguist Louise Banks point of view. The US Army needs her to communicate with these Aliens that have just landed on earth, as the film goes on we see that these Aliens give her all sorts of information. Like I said, there are only 2 Kingdoms, if this were a real life situation, Louise would be getting her information from demons, clearly these Aliens are not God, so there's only 1 other option. I personally don't believe in Aliens, I do however find the topic of aliens interesting at times, and I recommend a Christian site that talks about secular topics like this, the site is ""Answers In Genesis"", they offer a biblical perspective on secular issues and topics.Now, these ""Aliens"" tell Louise Banks of her future about her daughter Hannah who will have an incurable disease and will die before she even becomes a teenager. We find out the sort of plot-twist that those scenes with her and the daughter were not flashbacks, but were actually flash-forwards.As the film goes on, a character named Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) expresses his love for Banks. Louise agrees to have a child with Donnelly despite knowing what will happen to the daughter.I can see why this film has her decide this, the short amount of time to have and to show love, but this is not good enough of an excuse, Louise is being very selfish here, she knows that Hannah will die and with the information that Louise gets way beforehand she still agrees to have the child, the daughter will end up suffering and dying long before adulthood, how is that fair to the kid?! Also, Louise did not tell Donnelly the imperative information, she lied to him and that is also selfish, Donnelly leaving them wasn't right either, him leaving them was not nice at all and was so very wrong, but Louise Banks could've prevented all of that heartache, the best thing that she could have done is to not agree to have a kid with Donnelly and spare that poor child the pain.One could say ""But every human will eventually have to lose a loved one"", yes but if you're given information like that, then you have to not be selfish by thinking about yourself and think about the situation of the person that would suffer an incurable disease, if you could prevent a loved one from suffering - you would, so in Louise's situation she could have prevented the pain of another human being, plus think about the emotional trauma the child would experience, she probably desired to one day go to college, e.c.t., and all of it will be stripped away from her.This flick cannot be compared to the reality of humanity, humans are not going to get information from Aliens because Aliens do not exist, Scientists have spent millions of money for decades and decades trying to find alien life and there isn't any.This movie is just what it says it is - which is nothing but Science Fiction.
The Bible never mentions aliens, there are no purpose for aliens, the topic of aliens is just a distraction from Satan's Kingdom to distract people from turning to God.Arrival is just not a very good film, like I recommended earlier - listen to the Score on Spotify instead."

" It's a film which plays with your mind
",0.25,0.9951,2019-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Arrival directed by Denis Villeneuve is one of the best Science Fiction movies In recent years. Every single shot in this film is absolutely stunning. The large establishing shots of natural landscapes presented in quite muted colours, covered in blankets of mist is dripping with jaw dropping beauty. The story is a clear reflection of our current context, giving caution and direction for our future. The screenplay is intelligent, and so unique. Amy Adams in this film gives one of her best performances in my opinion, playing a linguist who is insanely overworked. The audience is made to feel everything she does, as if we are inside her mind. Also the score by Johan Johansson is eerie, chilling and almost ghostly. It works extremely well in the very quiet and mysterious tone of the film. The twist which comes to fruition towards the end, is simply genius. No spoilers of course, but it worked so well due to the talented film makers. It's a twist which makes you look at the entire film differently after attaining the new knowledge... literally it was as if my mind was on a rollercoaster when I figured it out. Unfortunately Arrival isn't completely flawless. One of my issues being being the role of Jeremy Renner. He kinda has a significant role, but in terms of the issue at hand, he literally does nothing. There's also another scene where a character breaks certain protocol and everyone is after them. But then what they are doing is completed, so they obey and everyone forgets about it. I feel like it was just there to build tension and make the scene more exciting. All in all I love this film. It benefits from multiple viewings. It's a film which plays with your mind and I love that. Arrival is incredibly well made and contains a great story so therefore I give it an 8."

",0.0,-0.6323,2019-03-22 00:00:00,3,"If I have to sit through another movie that takes itself as seriously as this film again, I'm going to glue my eyelids shut. I'm tired of films that use trailers to mislead viewers. Shoutout to circa 2003, when trailers literally explained what the movie was about. Now everything is about showing the fans 1 and a half minutes of action, taking their money at the box office, and filling the rest of the film up with pure garbage that half the viewers didn't sign up for. I mean seriously, if the movie is about a translator trying to communicate with peaceful aliens, why include any rifles, tanks and military in the trailer in the first place. Maybe show an actual scene of what the heck the movie is about. Oh wait, that would be boring and not attract viewers at the box office. Anyone who's sitting here talking about how profoundly moving this film was is trying to rationalize the enormous waste of money they used to watch this. If you're watching this for free, go right ahead. But heed my warning and don't pay to see this trash"

" INFINITELY MYSTERIOUS AND EMOTIONAL.
",0.1531,0.9894,2019-03-13 00:00:00,9,"My Rating : 9/10The first time seeing 'Arrival' in a theater confused and bored me to death and I couldn't understand anything having lost interest mid-way - also I wasn't such a cinephile 2 years ago. But a second viewing completely changed everything! Kudos to the film for surprising me so beautifully and keeping me fully engaged!How would I describe it? It's a hybrid of 'The Tree of Life' and 'Interstellar' except not as expansive - it's very minimal - though extremely well-edited to have maximum impact.It's more a fairy-tale for adults using interesting concepts of time, language and adding in aliens because aliens are cool and intelligent. Yes, there is some suspension of disbelief required on part of the viewer to ignore the plot holes and cliches, so if you're able to 'buy into' the fairy tale you're in for a philosophical, emotional ride.Using communication and the idea of how as people we are limited in our understanding of the world because of 'thinking' in a particular language 'Arrival' explores our fundamental reason for existence - Why are WE here and what if we had the ability to see the future what would we do and how would we live and make choices going forward? Would we change anything along the way or not?Honestly, I am really overjoyed at having seen this movie - it really offers the viewer a variety of perspectives - the movie is like the heptapod and we the audience playing the protagonist and figuring out how it all fits in our own lives!Brilliant piece of filmmaking. The only reason it's not getting a 10/10 is because of some plotholes which are kind of cringe if you know what I mean."

" A fantastic, cerebral, and realistic approach to a classic sci-fi scenario.
",0.5574,0.9813,2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,"Despite all the mindless action and sex that hits the big screen every year, every once in a while there comes a film that's a little more . . . cerebral. Arrival (2016) certainly fits this category. Not only do you really have to pay attention to what's happening in this film, it makes you question how we perceive our world as it is right now. Never before have I seen the topic of encountering alien life forms approached from such a realistic and logical way. It makes sense that we wouldn't be able to understand them, so the first step in establishing an understanding is to establish communication.Much like Christopher Nolan, who has done a number of great, ""cerebral"" films including Memento (2000), Inception (2010), and Interstellar (2014), I have recently come to appreciate the directorial talents of Denis Villeneuve. From his previous films like Prisoners (2013) and Sicario (2015), I've seen him deliver powerful messages about who we are as humans and how we deal with evil. In Arrival, once again the enemy is humanity itself, and the angry and violent mistrust it has against anything it doesn't understand. Fortunately, despite its repeated visual motif of black and white, Arrival shows that peace can be found in the gray area of language interpretation.While I don't want to give away the twist of this film, I have to say that the way it was presented certainly makes for a powerful impact once it has been realized. I will simply attribute this to the talent of Denis Villeneuve and the superb screenplay used to guide the audience along to the stunning conclusion. If you haven't seen any of Villeneuve's films yet, now's a great time to start. I certainly will look forward to his next piece, if this is the type of work he's putting out right now.A fantastic, cerebral, and realistic approach to a classic sci-fi scenario, I give Arrival 5.0 stars out of 5."

Plus, it is a story within a story; nit an easy film to fully grasp the first time I saw it. It took a 2nd screening to really have it sink in. I especially like the fact that instead of ""dumbing down"" this film, they assumed a level of higher intelligence from the audience, which is (partially) why it works so well. Denis Villeneuve is on top of the director's world right now. I don't care hiw many awards are given to Alfonso Cuaron (too many). Villneuve is by far ahead if everyone. Amy Adams is so perfectly cast in her role, also. In fact, Villneuve wouldn't make the film without her; he insisted that she get the part. Luckily fir the studio and producers, she was available. I dont want to reveal anymore than I already have (such is not too much). Also, Villeneuve's favorite conductor, Johanne Johansson has a stunning score, as well. Enjoy; on many levels, too."
" An enjoyable sci fi film
",0.4404,0.8537,2019-03-08 00:00:00,7,"The film tries to tie in two big concepts, one about communication, and another about time. In the end those concepts get somewhat muddled and open a number of plot holes that were obvious even on a first viewing, and would be positively glaring on repeat viewings. The atmosphere is great and the acting is spot on, but the film is a bit hampered by a script and plot that starts off strong and then begins to droop towards the end."

The idea that the worlds military would attempt to destroy an alien craft that had shown no aggressive intent and whose weapons capability they had no comprehension of is just plain stupid .The superpowers haven't attacked each other because they know the devastation that would entail and yet they are making threats to aliens who have far greater capability than we have -they have space ships that can fly to other galaxies and yet we are making threats against them .Painting the military as stupid is an old Hollywood cliche and should have no part in this film As to the main characters they are just boring .Adams is a fine actress but in this film there was no real acting to do -looking sad and removing your make up is all she had to do -to be honest any actress could have played this role with their eyes closed..
The film needed more interaction with Adams and the White House through an intermediary,with her concerns and what she was trying to achieve and the Presidents justified worry about what should be the most prudent course of action.The joke is we never see a President ,just some gung ho lacky making stupid decisions that are frankly unbelievable.
The film paints itself as a work of art and it is far from that .Really annoying was the overdramatised music drowning out what was being said -very amateurish

If you wish a quick reference to any recent well-known movies, the result is a bit like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar crossed with Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life. Robert Zemeckis's Contact (1997) would not be very far either, because Arrival also focuses on fragile yet brave female protagonist whose quality acting is one of the main pillars carrying the whole experience. The other one would be overall atmosphere, deliciously dark and ominous. Some will like it, others will probably find it depressing and maybe a bit slow for their taste."

" Thoughtful, unlike other Alien-Human Contact Films
",0.3818,0.9567,2019-02-12 00:00:00,10,"I have been watching a number of similar films recently, from 'Contact' to 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' This movie is different. It is not a white person's fantasy as much as the others but is more of a movie about how the aliens think, about language, about the change of time (past, present, and future). I remember being blown away when I first saw it back in 2016 and I still feel that affect. Amy Adams leads the movie as the protagonist while Ryan Reynolds is a good supporting character. The aliens are not like those in Close Encounters or those in War of the Worlds, but rather they have a mission to unite humanity together, something which the character played by Amy Adams (Louise) helps to push along. The movie is still strong and a good piece of science fiction...that really makes you think.I do have one question however: if Louise can see in the future can she not see her own death? If so, that would be deeply disturbing. Perhaps the movie purposely did not go to that place.Sure humanity is together at the end but at what cost? There is martial law in the streets of the U$ and constant looting, mass suicide by a religious cult, and unrest across the world. Yet this somehow barely affects them in Montana (or anywhere in the world)...why? Do we really need a group of elites to save humanity? Can't humans save themselves? That is what is concerning aboit this movie. Additionally the military is handling this operation and has somehow not engaged in a use of force yet? Come on. Why would the alien land in the U$? That is the last place they would want to go.Still, I would definitely watch this movie again as it clearly has powerful themes without a doubt. That is all."

Instead, I found myself watching Arrival.I admit to being confused at first, and then I hovered perilously in danger of turning it off immediately because of immediate wrenching heartbreak- I walked out of Up. But there was a reason for it, so brace yourself for some feels.The message of this movie is that love is the answer. It's the only answer to every question that matters. And even if I had known earlier in my life what heartbreak was in store for me in exchange for the irreplaceable moments of joy, I would not change a single thing.There will be moments of confusion for you as you kind of try to figure out where in time you are, but it'll turn out that doesn't matter.Amy Adams with her grace and quiet strength brought me to tears, and as other reviews will mention, I was not bored for a single moment, despite a slow pace and no terribly deep dialogue. If you are the kind of person who yearns for humanity to get its act together, this movie is a can't miss."
" The movie presents relations between communication, technology and globalization
",0.0,0.9115,2019-02-05 00:00:00,8,"In the film ""The Arrival"", is raised the question of how our globalized world would react after the unexpected visit of strange speakers of a strange language, called heptapods. The linguist Louise Banks is called to decipher what the purpose of the visitors is.The first sight of the globalization process on the subject is when Louise enters the command center, where several video monitors are running, each one with a representative of the countries where there were landings. It is a great conference where each nation would update the other on what each one has learned about the pretensions of the aliens. That way, the tecnology is indeed shortening distances and promoting cooperation between nations, as the ideal of globalization intends .However, this harmony is short-lived: when they discover the offer of a ""weapon"" to be shared with Earth, the line of communication is cut off and some countries isolate themselves with bellicose proposals. And the borders close again. Also, the US military is reluctant to accept Banks's theories, who says that ""we need to teach the difference between a weapon and a tool. Things can be confusing when the same object can be used in both ways."" The cause of the desunity among the nations is, however, only a matter of misinterpretation of the new language: the ""weapon"" was the ability to have a new vision about time, given as a gift to the Terrans because the Heptapods would need our help three thousand years from now.In the film, the linguist makes it clear that language is a bridge, a possibility to live with the other, that the other can be understood in the light of multiculturality. Unfortunately, at the moment of crisis the possibilities of union are forgotten and the world takes a defensive attitude against the heptapods, demonstrating the fallibility of communication between nations, even in a planet that is globalized.Drawing a parallel from the film to actual events, we can see that it portrays the importance of communication in world politics and, tied to it, technology as a (dis)service to human relations. The criticism made in the film can be understood as the fact that humans have more difficulty understanding each other than to understand a completely new language and no phonemes related to spelling. Turning to technology, which provides all the necessary means for communication between people, it is clear that it is commanded by something not so interested in globalizing the world in an ideal way, but in the ways pointed out by Brazilian geographer Milton Santos: globalization as fable and perversity.Because of all of those aspects, this movie is very efficient when shows that technology may help communications and a fair globalization, but this process is delayed by the selfishness of the nations. And as happened in the movie, was only overcomed after a new view of time - here almost as a superpower - used by Louise to convince the Chinese leader to be cooperative."

The movie doesn't offer exciting twists, so much as requiring you to see the whole thing to fully understand what you have seen. And of course, that understanding brings a different perspective upon second viewing.But it holds up, the aliens are alien, the sound design is otherworldly and the characters give the actors something to do, although I would have preferred a bit more depth from the supporting characters. However, Amy Adams could carry the movie on her performance alone and luckily, she doesn't have to.My one issue with the story-telling is the level of exposure the main character appears to need (and thus the audience along with her) to come to her realisations, but it's not grating and doesn't diminish the experience too much.Don't watch this if you're looking for exciting aliens sci-fi, do watch this if you like a through-provoking piece that doesn't mind following some of the tropes while still telling a wholly original story."

I know a lot of people think it's boring but it was far from boring when I saw it. In fact I thought it was mesmerizing.We're introduced to a race of aliens who's spaceships come down in 12 different parts of the world. And they just stay there, floating above the surface, waiting for us to make the next move.Amy Adams stars as a brilliant linguistics professor who is brought on to try to communicate with the aliens. The problem is their language is something that is... well... alien in every sense of the word. The movie then deals with the characters as well as their drive to solve this and actually communicate with them.Joining her is Jeremy Renner who plays a mathematician who believes that math and physics is the way to understand the aliens. And between them they finally manage to crack the alien's language and with it gain a deeper understanding of the world and the nature of time.There's some great acting, some interesting science and linguistics being done as well as some really good cinematography and a very alien set of aliens.If you want something smart and enjoy movies that are a little more cerebral than shoot em ups, then this is for you."

Only for a group of rogue soldiers to try and blow up the ship our protagonist is working out of and our resident aliens live in. But don't worry, our highly-advanced tentacled guests are much more forgiving than we are. Turns out, the aliens have a gift for us and actually still want us to have it even after that little stunt by a bunch of army privates. That gift turns out to be their highly-advanced language: Etch A Sketch. No kidding! What's even better is their version of Etch A Sketch can tell the future! So, now our alien flick turns into Looper? *Insert Captain Jean-Luc Picard Meme Here*Are you confused yet? Anyway, trying to explain the plot and the twist from this point forward gets even harder to do, so I won't. Let's just say it doesn't help that our characters are so wooden and mostly useless. Poor Forest Whitaker and Jeremy Renner. Both try their best, but Whitaker pulls off a no nonsense colonel better than Renner does a physicist. But that's not entirely Renner's fault. They pretty much gave him nothing to do other than be a glorified translation assistant and eventual love interest of Amy Adams. Then there is the screenplay and dialogue. Dreadful! Renner's character actually named our two main aliens Abott and Castillo. What's worse is the aliens actually answered to it!!!! *Insert More Captain Jean-Luc Picard Memes Here*"

",-0.2023,0.9985,2019-01-16 00:00:00,10,"""Arrival"" is a sci-fi tape from Canadian master Dani Villeneuve, who for the first time works in this genre, but copes with it like a brave veteran. This is a stunningly beautiful, touching, piercing and even meditative film that gives the viewer an unforgettable experience.One of the best linguists on the planet performed by Amy Adams is picked up in the middle of the night by the US military in order to find a common language with one of the twelve suddenly appeared alien ships. Along with her, the physicist is being played by Jeremy Renner, who, for the most part, is assigned the role of assistant. The general, played by Forrest Whitaker, demands that scientists find out from aliens as quickly as possible what the purpose of the latter is on our planet. In parallel, we are told the story of the personal life of the heroine Adams, and somewhere in the background, through TV broadcasts, you can watch the economic and political crisis occur on Earth. Surprisingly, none of these lines turns out to be superfluous, and by the end they merge into an amazingly beautiful and skillful piece, where there is not a single extra detail.Frankly speaking, this is a classic film of the ""Hollywood period"" by Dany Villeneuve - a dark, tedious, tense and intriguing movie, where it's unclear to the very end how it all ends. But if in previous works Villeneuve kept the final twist right up to the final, then in ""Arrival"" this twist is incredibly smooth and it is designed not to surprise the viewer, but to make him collect the overall picture in his head. And it damn well works for this movie.Villeneuve himself called his tape ""a slow striptease,"" and it's really better not to invent a comparison. Some aliens have to wait quite a long time to see in all its glory, but they are made amazingly. The language of aliens is no less effectively made by their way of communicating, which is really very different from human. But the communication problems of two civilizations will be of interest to absolutely everyone, not just linguists - after all, the language in ""Arrival"" has tremendous plot importance, and after watching you want to immediately learn it, or at least translate a couple of sentences.In the end, you understand that ""Arrival"" is really something like the cinematic equivalent of a symphony, which in the final reaches incredible harmony and polyphony. All elements of this tape, previously played separately, begin to sound together and are connected into something single and indivisible. If up to this point it is still possible to resist the ""Arrival"", then at the time of the denouement, Dany Vilev completely disarms the viewer, leaving him on the direct path to the catharsis.Much more could have been written about Amy Adams' awesome game (give her an Oscar already!), Johann Johannson's terrific music or Bradford Young's hypnotic camera work, but the fact that ""Arrival"" is so holistic, so harmonious work, that ""dissect"" its parts simply have no desire. Harmony in the film is generally one of the key themes, and Villeneuve succeeds not only to show it on the screen, but also to embody it in the film itself.However, the most surprising thing about the ""Arrival"" is in the other. ""Science fiction"" of this movie turns out to be just a screen, behind which lies the real story about a person, love and free will. Dani Villeneuve managed to create a fascinating structure and at the same time an incredibly deep almost philosophical ribbon that absolutely everyone will be able to understand, because the theme that the director comes to in the final is all that is close to each of us.P.S. And ""Arrival"" is the case when the movie wants to be revised again, as soon as it ends."
" Best alien movie I have ever seen
",0.6369,0.629,2019-01-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie really blew me away. Amy Adams' performance and her ability to smash down barriers put before her, in terms of things the military didn't want her to do, was powerful. She really carried the movie. These aliens are unlike any in other movies I have seen. How? They came to Earth in order to unite humanity and they believe that time is cyclical, not a straight line. This was great as it broke down the common stereotype of aliens, saying that if we communicate together, work together, we can get more than fighting. Also, I liked the dig at the person watching a Rush Limbaugh type character who I think is killed by the aliens or something, if I remember right, who totally deserves it.All in all, I would definitely watch this wonderful movie again."

and s s s l l l o o o w w w - or I would have given it a quick pass.This time, aliens are huge squids who arrive in what looks like a humongous suppository and communicate by belching squid ink - you know, my favorite fantasy is one in which an alien space ship lands on earth ... and out come the most gorgeous, physically- perfect beings we ever saw.

But there is not only a very good story, this masterpiece was shot in a very unusual way, too. Nearly no action scenes, overall very calm and also the approach is very scientific. One can really believe that contacting an alien life form and communicating with it could actually work as shown in this movie.

" A More Leisurely Scary Communication with Aliens
",-0.539,0.8083,2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"11 November 2016. Amy Adams stars in this psychological, space-time mystery. While not as compelling or engrossing as Interstellar (2014), Arrival has the same thrill of the new, unusual, and the unknown. Perhaps on the same level as the more claustrophobic Barry Levinson's Sphere (1998), Arrival brings with it a more personal, intimate backstory similar to what Manhunter (1986) accomplished with its parent-child interaction crime-thriller starring William Petersen of CSI. What makes this movie special is its expansion on the alien theme and how we communicate. There is the visual from Wavelength (1983), a sci-fi movie about alien beings and a couple's attempt to help them escape from a secret government station. There is the variation on a communication angle somewhat related to Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Whether or not the recent election of Donald Trump as President of the United States might fundamentally alter the impact of the likely storyline of this movie in terms of this country's response to such an alien situation is hard to figure. Unlike the singular hardcore response found in Phantoms (1998), Arrival offers up a more convoluted response. Arrival presents experiences similar to the sci fi classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Epoch (2001) of which Arrival has many similarities. In some ways, Arrival has the same tone and unworldly presentation as the remake version with George Clooney in Solaris (2002) but with an even a more soft touch. In a fashion, Arrival is the reverse of Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) that instead of the aliens having come and gone and humanity going to them, in Arrival the Aliens appear and remained."

I grew up, got busy with life but those priceless timeless beautiful storytelling moments that I once shared, that amazed me in wonder, curiosity, imagination and desire to know more..I know if I think hard enough I might remember some of them, but that's not the point. The point is all those stories had characters and people and objects and places and things that I could either imagine or something that I could picture and understand and visualize in my young mind. If not for those imaginable characters and people, I would have never understood those stories, the true meaning of the story, the actual story behind the story that my dad probably wanted me to understand.Arrival, for me is such a story. Aliens are just fun characters that help me understand the story so I can actually see beyond it and understand the untold story. You see, the way I understand it is that the director had to dumb it down for us and wrap this movie in a sci-fi genre and add aliens so you could relate it to something you are familiar with and hoped, really hoped that we try to understand the true purpose, the message behind all this. It simply couldn't have been portrayed better than this!This movie teaches you a lot of things, if you are ready to learn.

",0.6249,0.9108,2019-01-09 00:00:00,8,"In case you have never heard of this film, Arrival is an alien film without the over the top action/chaos such as in films like Indepence Day. Arrival will require patience. This is a visually stunning film and I suggest to the audience to be patient and enjoy the clever and creative shots. Fans who have previously seen Sicario will be able to appreciate this director.Lucky enough, the movie trailers for this film showed very little of what the film is about. The only tag line we have ever heard is ""Why are they here""...The film opens up with Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams) who appears to have just given birth to her daughter. We are then shown their life, progressing quickly through a moving sequence. Then we flash to present day where Louise is a expert linguist and lectures professionally.While she is teaching a class it is soon discovered that earth will change forever. People panic when multiple spacecrafts land on earth. Louise is shortly requested to join (and lead) an elite team to investigate further.Amy Adams provides an outstanding performance (no surprise here, duh!) but we are forced to put up with a couple of characters that really don't hold any major purpose in the film. There are many moments where I even question Jeremy Renner's role- I felt he was some what wasted as an actor.Arrival, I must say is a top sci-fi film. As an audience we have questions from the word go and to top it off, the viewer's questions only pile up as the movie progresses. Even when the film is over you will still be thinking about it- seriously, give it the next day or two. But is that a bad thing?After thinking about my total score for this review for a couple of days now, I'm pretty sure certain things with the film's plot (and ending) simply just don't add up. But then again, I remind myself.... it is a sci-fi film after all.7.8/10

" Close to a masterpiece, a true work of art
",0.7845,0.9989,2019-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Arrival is an outstanding piece of work, and overall it impressed me in a way that other films havent, for a long time. Watching it made me feel that I discovered a hidden gem, and I feel fortunate for such a discovery.However, it suffers from certain inconsistencies/plot holes, as I will attempt to demonstrate in this review, with a few examples:Inconsistencies/Plot Holes
The biggest issue that I found, was that of the ""gift"" that Louise receives from the aliens.
We are told that Louise receives a ""gift"" or ""weapon"" from the alien heptapods, and what that is, is the power to see the future, as is claimed in the movie.Louise can see what will happen later on in her life, and she can see that in the form of visions that come to her out of nowhere, and these visions often resemble memories of things that havent happened yet but they will supposedly happen in the future. It is as if she is getting the memories that will form in the future, but she's getting bits and pieces of them in advance.Now here's the problem with that:
One of the key elements in the story, was Louise's action to call General Shang, and change his mind. Without that plot part, the whole story basically falls apart.
But Louise doesnt have a way of contacting Shang and doesnt have a clue what would change his mind.
The way that Louise achieves this, is by getting a vision of General Shang literally showing her his personal phone number, that can be used to reach Shang directly, at any time. Shang also tells her (in the vision) what she told him to change his mind: his wife's dying words.
If Louise sees the future, how could it be that she acquired Shang's phone number and his wife's dying words in the first place?
The vital key information that Louise extracts from that vision is required in order to change Shang's mind. If that vision is what will happen in the future, then that future is impossible because she needs the vision in order to get that information. Its a paradox, and its circular. It simply doesnt make sense, its illogical.A much better explanation that doesnt create paradoxes, is that the vision isnt of something that happens in the future, but simply a way for Louise to gain that vital key information (phone number and wife's words).
So its a false vision, not a vision of the future, but something imaginary that comes to her simply because she needs it. But who's giving her that vital info?
It could very well be the aliens, but if that is the case, then the aliens are simply directing Louise to do what they want her to do. They are implanting those visions in her head, and then fool her into thinking that she has some magical power of seeing the future.In the vision in question, Louise is told by Shang that she was able to change his mind by calling him on his private phone number, and that Shang himself doesnt know how she got his number. Louise, even in the vision, acts surprised, and she genuinely doesnt know what Shang's phone number is. So much so, that she even tells him ""I dont know your private number"", so Shang has to show the number to her on his cell phone.
Then he tells her ""Now you know"". So Shang himself was aware that she doesnt know, in that vision.
Also, he tells her that she told him his ""wife's dying words"", and he does so right before he wispers in her ear everything she told him.
These things wouldnt have actually taken place if such an event happened.
Shang, in the vision, was telling Louise what she needed to know in order to change his mind. All Louise has to do, was follow those simple instructions:
A) Call Shang on his private phone number that she just received, and
B) Repeat verbatim the words that he tells her, as he tells her, in the vision.Conclusion? The vision never happens, not in the past, present, or future.
Louise is basically told what she needs to do to change General Shang's mind.But who tells her? The film never answers that question. We are left to assume that its the aliens, as it seems to be the most (or only) likely explanation.
This is actually one of several questions that arent answered in the film.Moreover, Louise has already been having many visions of her spending time with a little girl, who is apparently her daughter. She also sees that she has this daughter with her husband, Ian.
These are things that havent yet happened, and we are told that she sees the future with that gift of hers.The problem with that is, it isnt really a future, until she makes it so. In other words, its A possible future, with many other possibilities as well, but those possibilities cant be seen by Louise through visions.Louise only sees one possible future, and it is a future that can easily be avoided:
Should she decide to not get romantically involved with Ian, and it instantly goes away.Should she also decide to not have a baby with him, and all the parts about her having a daughter also vanish.Her daughter has an incurable, unspecified, fatal illness, and dies. She can also avoid that, by having an abortion early on, and then trying for another baby.The chances of all of her children having the same illness and dying are very slim.
To eliminate those chances, she and Ian can adopt a baby and that way they wont lose their child at such a young age.
Ian leaves her after she tells him something that he didnt like hearing. What was that, we are not told, but whatever it was, she can choose not to tell him, and Ian will probably not leave her.If Louise chooses to....you get the picture.What I'm getting at, is that there is no pre-determined future, even according to the film's own narrative, so what Louise sees, is a potential future that can easily be avoided if you know important parts of that future.
So why this future? And why not change it if you can?
The explanation given is very poor, almost not an explanation at all. Because thats what it means to be human? Surely pain and suffering are part of the human condition, but not voluntarily so. We dont opt for suffering, we try to avoid it as much as possible.Perhaps Louise decided to do this, because even though she will suffer when her daughter dies, all of the time that she spends with her while she's alive is priceless, and she doesnt want to give that up.
But again, what if she can have that with another child, and not have to give up anything?
Again, Louise sees only 1 possible future. Who knows what would happen if she got romantically involved with another man?
Or be with Ian, but adopt a baby?
Its all very problematic, to say the least.Also, this language that she's given, she later on starts teaching it in classes, and she even writes a handbook on it.
This, along with the visions, are given to her by the aliens.The most logical conclusion, is that Louise is actually directed by the aliens to do certain things and live a certain life.
Why give her these visions? Why give her this universal language? Why give her the information that she needs to change Shang's mind?
It is much more likely that these aliens want certain things to happen on earth, and they are working through Louise, they are changing things by proxy.
Louise is merely someone who is more receptive and more likely to make it happen.But what is this strange gift? It seems more like a magical power, more like what a psychic would claim to have (more on this later).
And how can those aliens have this power, and even give it to someone else without so much as touching them?
Remember, that Louise is having visions BEFORE she enter's the room with the aliens inside the spaceship.
She actually receives that power or ""gift"" and she doesnt even realize it.In spite of all of that however, Arrival is actually an excellent film and an even better work of art:Amy Adams successfully carries the film on her shoulders, but without overshadowing everything else. Her acting is superb, maybe even downright perfect, I might say, with her natural ability to convey innocence and sweetness, to a pretty damn real level. Her facial expressions, as well as her verbal and non-verbal cues are spot on, and you get the impression that this is a real character that you are able to connect with.I strongly believe that no one could actually do a better job than Amy Adams in the starring lead role of this movie.
It is as if she was born for this role, I may even be willing to say that the role was written specifically for her.The rest of the cast are there to support Amy, but they are also very good, especially Jeremy Renner (Ian) who acts as Amy's co-star, but not having as much burden on his acting shoulders. Even though Amy is tasked with doing most of the heavy-lifting, the supporting cast dont seem to be irrelevant and shouldnt be ignored, as they are all able to do their acting jobs a lot better than you'd expect.The cinematography is just stunning, with some aerial shots seeming too damn spectacular, even for a movie of this caliber. The most impressive part of this film however, isnt just great camera-work and angles; no, it goes way beyond that. Director Denis Villeneuve and everyone who worked on this film should feel proud of themselves, as the cinematography is downright some of the best work I've seen in all my years watching movies.The soundtrack is very strong, emotional, dramatic, but without overdoing it.The song at the beginning and ending of the film is so emotionally charged, and it fits so well with the entire theme and plot of the film, that it is as if the song was composed specifically for Arrival, even though it wasnt. It isnt even a new track from Max Richter, and it actually dates back to being released in an album that is well over a decade before the film came out.
Yet in spite of that, Max Richter's ""On the Nature of Daylight"" fits so damn well with the film, and it manages to make a relatively not-so-impressive ending truly spectacular.Well done :)

It's not one of a kind, ""Interstellar"" had a similar scope, but it offers something more. Firstly, it respects the audience in the sense that it feels plausible, and it should feel this way. How can an ambitious and surreal plot live on a basis of wacky science fiction? In the first part of ""Arrival"", the viewer is stunned by the dazzling images and the extraordinary hypothetical scenario. Already enough entertaining, the movie then takes another unexpected course. The plot grows more twisted, without becoming too convoluted.
One beautiful thing that sometimes happens in movies is when an already meaningful element takes on an even more significant nuance. The initial monologue about memory, about the scattered recollections from an entire life, already beautiful in itself, becomes part of the significance of the whole movie, and it's truly satisfying when it does.
""Arrival"" hits the right spot and makes all the pieces fall into place, bringing an ingenious idea to life, which can also live outside the intricate sci-fi context."
" Arrival : Language, time and life
",0.0,0.9633,2018-12-05 00:00:00,7,"Denis Villeneuve is a modern day Hitchcock, his heart wrenching unique thrillers and deep rooted character based story arcs reminds of films we loved and we missed, but he makes them in his modern tradition.His Prisoners (2013) and Enemy (2014) are very dark and is unique filmmaking, you only see in Denis's films itself.Sicario (2015) takes deeper roots into human condition relating to crime and drug activities which is also an addition to his deep and darker cinematic film making style.Arrival (2016) his latest film is a sci-fi based on an alien space craft appearance and it's communication through linguistics of the alien race translated by a language specialist Dr. Louise Banks played by Amy Adams. Her performance is remarkable.The depth of substance of the film is commendable. Aspects of civilisation and humanity like language, time and life are analysed and put to the screen in an amazing way by the filmmakers.This film is a Denis Villeneuve film with such expansion to his tradition. Unlike other films this is more filled with hope and love. He expands into the aspects of his slow swiftly camera work rather than being haunting like in his previous films into being a more poetic and like song of nature and humanity. It's a real upgrade in his tradition in my perspective.He explores femininity in his latest two films giving major roles to female leads."

I watched it again one lazy Sunday afternoon and now I can officially proclaim that this is one of the greatest and most profound movies that I have ever seen.
It is intelligent at the same time as being moving, gripping, thoughtful and inspiring, something that isn't easy to do in a sci-fi movie.If you love movies, please take the time to watch this film, I can't see how you would be possibly disappointed.
PS. If you enjoyed Contact with Jodie Foster, well then, prepare to love this film. Amy Adams is absolutely outstanding!"

A clever psycological drama about how language shapes the way we think and a critique not of society as a political entity, but as a linguistic construct detatched from the meta dimension."

Is it considered a spoiler to say there's a twist, even if I don't go into detail?My only critique was ONE LINE Jeremy Renner says at/near the end.

The music score and bloody hell the hero of the movie was the cinematography. There were few shots in the movie which left you awestruck. Especially the first instance we see the alien ship, the shot of the Chinook, with the ship, the fog/cloud flowing down the mountains.

",0.6249,-0.8425,2018-11-17 00:00:00,10,"I wasted an hour reading some of the negative reviews. Most of the 1-stars fall into a couple of buckets:A) They didn't pay attention, asking questions or pointing out ""holes"" that are clearly addressed in the movie. These people are just wrong and/or don't like movies that require focus.B) They don't understand the actual point of the movie. These ones are more understandable - but still wrong, IMO. In their defense, the marketing did make this seem more action-oriented.The point a lot of folks are missing is that this isn't really a story about aliens. Aliens and first contact are used to tell a story about how humans conceptualize time.The great tragedy that we must experience time linearly.The realization that experiencing time non-linearly would come with its own heartbreaking consequences.IMO, Arrival is fundamentally a thought-piece on Kierkegaard's famous quote: ""Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.""I can see why it'd be offputting to expect an action-packed alien flick and instead get a cerebral contemplation on the nature of time. That doesn't change that it's a masterpiece."

Well that's just super, thank you a lot, advanced race. Oh, and the message of unification - very innovative, never since the Beatles have I heard such a compelling message to Come Together. I mean, it's great that to aliens the concept of time is circular, but to us it's still linear, and generations upon generations will have to live and suffer as they did before, with no help from the oh so advanced aliens, whom we have to help in 3000 years. It's like with that daughter who dies from cancer - the heroine knows she's gonna die, but decides to have a child anyway, well isn't it nice to knowingly give life to a person who won't get to experience it fully and end in suffering just to satisfy some personal ambitions and ""experience love"".

It's well shot, great camera work, good CGI, it seems realistic enough in general for a first contact scenario to possibly happen like this. It's not over the top action, it's more like reality than Hollywood.

" A smart, thought-provoking science fiction masterpiece.
",0.7783,0.9914,2018-11-12 00:00:00,10,"I think the term ""thought provoking"" is often overused when describing things. For me, a film fits that description when it causes me to keep thinking about the film's message long after the credits roll; when it open my mind to a new way of observing or thinking about the world.If you only watched the few half an hour or so of Arrival, you may conclude that it is a run-of-the-mill movie about alien contact and its impact on human society. Yawn. But if you watch the movie all the way to the end, Arrival reveals itself to be something far, far greater than that.Arrival's aliens, the heptapods, are not a stereotypical hollywood alien race. They don't ""arrive"" to conquer, or to introduce us to the rest of the galaxy. They arrive to give humanity a gift: A new way of perceiving time. Even if that gift can only be truly experienced by Louise, the main character, ""Arrival"" gives the audience an opportunity to try to truly understand simultaneous awareness.This is Arrival's core strength. It offers a truly deep examination of what it would be like to experience all of our lives at once. It explores how that changed mode of awareness would affect our language, our mathematics, and our choices.There are many, many differences between Arrival and the short it is based on, ""Story of your life,"" but Arrival manages to masterfully adapt the short's core message to the form of a film.Oh, and it doesn't hurt that the acting, cinematography, music, and direction are all stellar as well."

This film reaches out to ALL the typical cliche questions I've ever had in alien film: why do alien always have to be resembling us? How come they can live and breathe the same air as us - who says they didn't evolve in different conditions than us? And why are they either more interlectual than us, or just savage beasts? And the most important one: WHY do they always understand us or conveniently have technology that can translate our speech? And WHY do they always have to use a mouth and speech or sounds like we do? Whose to say there's not an entirely different way of communicating in outer space that humans quite simply cannot comprehend?ENTER ARRIVAL!!!!!!Arrival is so complex and so wonderfully well written. I've studied linguistics myself and the approach during this film was absolutely, mind-glowingly amazing. They take everything we know about math, science and linguistics to a new level. I found that watching this film the second time is even better. I really enjoy how this is a film that is fully aware of what genre it's in, and creates some typical settings that the audience is familiar with, but brings in a whole new and quite original approach! And most importantly: it actually made sense out of what it was trying to do. It is fiction, yes, but so well written that it truly makes you believe that the language studied in the film is just another unknown language humans don't know about!Please don't be fooled by these bad reviews I saw! If you're just into action and brain dead films that doesn't make you use your brain a little, then this is probably not for you.But if you enjoy a true masterpiece that makes you think and reflect, and which stays in your mind hours after you watched it, then you'll love it!!Had to give 10 stars because this film might just have made it to the top of my favourite alien genre films!"
" Film Liquet on Arrival
",0.0,0.743,2018-11-07 00:00:00,7,"After the appearance of 12 extraterrestrial spacecrafts around Earth, the US armed forces recruit linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), in order to research the written language of the aliens. Further on, Louise starts seeing visions of past or future, which one? She does not know and has yet to find out and use it to solve the mystery.Having a linear structure, the film sometimes decides to move in time, providing interesting effects for the audience to experience, such as minor confusions and peaks of interest throughout, as the language of the aliens becomes more and more interesting to the linguist, the audience is also tempted to find out the answers to many mysterious signs that are not translated into human language. However this kind of storytelling leaves a lot of unanswered questions.With several turning moments in the films, the whole film becomes a philosophical argument of the concept of time, making it so the viewers aren't left without a point to think about. The film broke the main principle by not showing, but telling us the needed information in order to move the plot forward. Although it is better for the audience to experience it firsthand along with the main characters."

""Close Encounters"", etc. is non threatening, but has no true meaning. Also, in order to fully understand this film, I had to watch it a second time. If you don't, you will miss at least some of the multi-layered stories being told. The part about her daughter, her precognition, etc. are pretty obvious. What took me in the second viewing was this: I came to the conclusion that when Louise is ""remembering the future"", for lack of a better term, time stops in everyone else's space-time continuum. In other words, several minutes may pass while she is thinking/remembering about her daughter, but time does not for the others. There are a couple of exceptions, but this is a primary part of the film that I missed the first viewing. Also, it grew on me the next time as well. It is truly brilliant, and without Amy Adams, I dont think it would have been as good; I don't care who else you can think of. The director said the same thing: he had to have her, or he wouldn't make the film. BTW, Stanley Kubrick said the same exact thing about Malcolm McDowell in 1970 before he began filming ""A Clockwork Orange"". Keanu Reeves absolutely flipped he liked this film so much. I agree. It is hard to top. I liked it more than ""Blade Runner 2049""; absolutely. I think Villeneuve is at the pinnacle right now. Even Ridley Scott has competition in this regard, and he produced BR 2049."

" The most authentic ""What if aliens actually visited"" movie I've ever seen
",0.0,0.4137,2018-10-02 00:00:00,10,"I've seen this movie many times, twice on cinema, because I had to bring my son to see it, it made such an impact on me.
What this movie does, which makes the whole movie so much more authentic, is that everything that happens in the world, you view through the eyes of the main character. There are no ""meanwhile, in the White House"" scenes, or ""meanwhile, in France"". The few scenes you get from other parts of the World are either through news on the radio, or on TV. This makes the movie all the more claustrophobic and realistic. This is what would probably happen if Aliens visited, and why I love this movie so much. It keeps the suspense up to the very end, keeping you on edge while the nations of the World tries to figure out, in their own way, what the hell is going on. Why are these alien aricrafts here and what do they want. Do they want war? Share knowledge? Our resources? Also, don't get me started on the scenery. If you've seen Prisoners, Sicario or Blade Runner 2049, you know what to expect: Huge, magnificient scenes with music that demands your attention. There are some scenes here that still gives me the chills when I see them. The music depicts what these people must be feeling perfectly: alarming, menacing and alien. This movie also has a twist of sorts that makes it worth while to watch a second time, just to clear up any lose ends. Small scenes that makes more sense after you know what's actually going on: what's with the messy timeline? It all makes sense in the end. Well worth a watch."

" The Conundrum of Epistemic Arrival
",0.0,0.9682,2018-09-22 00:00:00,9,"Everybody dies, right? Near the midway point of Denis Villeneuve's Arrival, physicist Ian Donnelly quips this thought to colleague Louise Banks amidst the smoky, enigmatic chamber of their alien subjects. Little does he know this very idea will come back to influence the remaining course of his life.Arrival touches on a great many topics of intellectual and philosophical interest, including language acquisition, parenthood, mortality, political communication, and freedom of will. Centered around the work of two individuals to decode the purpose and mechanism of alien lifeforms, their results are more than applicable to life here on Earth. Although a touch too overt in some of the expository elements of the film, as seen when Dr. Banks wastes 30 seconds explaining the function of a whiteboard, or through strained, cheesy dialogue between Ian, Louise, and Colonel Weber throughout, the content subject matter itself captivates the audience with enough subplots to retain a wide audience.Symbolically, the descent of the heptapods and the looming presence of their ship serves to constantly remind our characters of inevitable death. The heptapods resemble claw-like creatures and live in a misty, white environment, poised to snatch up the mortal humans into their purgatorial atmosphere. In a sequence of cuts between Hannah's death and Louise's experience of them in the audience's frame of temporality, Louise is depicted literally looking over her shoulder at the looming ship, representative of humans' near constant anxiety about the pervasiveness of mortality.In a brief exchange between the two protagonists, the Sapir-Whorf theory of linguistic relativism, which lays the basis for the entire conclusion, is introduced forwardly. In this theory, the weak hypothesis claims that language categories influence thoughts and behavior; the strong hypothesis posits that language determine and limit cognitive categories. Such a distinction effectively compliments Louise's internal conflict to ""embrace"" a future that she has already experienced. When she asks Ian about the decision to influence the events of the ""future"", namely Hannah's death and their eventual marriage (to which he is completely oblivious), she fails to consider whether she even has agency to do so, as she has already experienced them in a non-linear timeline. The ""gift"" is not only an ability to predict events like Laplace's Demon, but rather to experience them simultaneously; otherwise, she would've been unable to leverage knowledge from her conversation with Shang in the ""future"" timeline.While her attitude has ties to Camus' Sisyphus, Martin Heidegger's concept of being-toward-death is encapsulated coherently. Heidegger spoke of a unity between all three time states of time: past, present, and future. To find a true joy and freedom, he proposes a non-linear, non-traditional view of time in regard to our mortality; to live in light of our death. Villeneuve himself commented on the film's meaning to him in an interview with The Verge: ""I know I'm going to die. I have three kids. What can happen right now? I need to trust life, I need to embrace life...That's the way I see it, personally. For me, the movie was about a woman having a new relationship with death and changing her perspective on her own life.""Despite limited flaws in chemistry between principal characters, a lack of dynamic development of Ian or Louise, and unnecessary plot addition of a political standoff, Arrival addresses areas of scholarly interest through a accessible, heart-wrenching, blockbuster lens, inviting intellectuals and laypeople alike to spend near two hours in a world of atemporal possibilities."

" Scores high marks for good intentions.
",0.4404,0.9791,2018-09-10 00:00:00,7,"Amy Adams acts her heart out in the role of Louise Banks, a renowned linguist who's recruited by the military when 12 mysterious spacecraft touch down (well, so to speak) in odd spots around the globe. The military hopes to get her to break through to the aliens and determine the nature of this otherworldly visit. Meanwhile, Louise is understandably sombre after having suffered a devastating personal tragedy. Much of the plot hinges on this incredible gift that Louise has, which she will attempt to utilize to avoid disaster.It's better not to reveal any more about story; some of these details and twists may actually come as unexpected.At first glance, this seems to be a somewhat different approach to alien ""invasion"" cinema. It's more intelligent than some entries into the genre, and more subtle, attempting to put a more ""realistic"" spin on what might happen were the people of Earth to be actually visited by an extraterrestrial intelligence. It's not for people who want action and spectacle. After a while, you do realize that this also a true human-interest drama, perhaps too drawn-out and manipulative to some viewers, but will definitely hit home for any parent who's ever lost a child, and/or had to watch them suffer.The film co-stars Jeremy Renner, as the scientist with whom Louise will work, Forest Whitaker, as a no-nonsense colonel supervising their efforts, Michael Stuhlbarg, as a CIA agent, and Tzi Ma, as a Chinese general who stirs the pot a bit. But make no mistake: this is almost entirely Amys' show, and her character is worthy of much sympathy and compassion, even if she seems to act senselessly at times.While ""Arrival"" is to be commended for concentrating more on human emotions than visual effects, it must be said that the design of the ""Heptapods"" (affectionately dubbed ""Abbott"" and ""Costello"" by Renner) is pretty effective. The other visuals on the alien ship are similarly striking.Overall, an affecting statement on the beauty of life and the way that the human race perceives things.Scripted by Eric Heisserer, based on the story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang.Seven out of 10."

The sappy Hollywood ending, hover, took the ratings down a notch.A LOT of work went into creating the unique sounds and language of the aliens.

",0.75,0.9536,2018-08-31 00:00:00,9,"I just caught this movie on Hulu. I must admit I don't recall this movie's theatrical release. But when I saw the high rating on IMDB and Rotten tomatoes I thought I would give it a try. While I do agree with other users that the pace was slow for a movie about aliens, I learned the pace was intentional in order to deliver a poignant, original and thought-provoking film. Like others, I shook my head in disbelief when Amy Adams pulled out a white board, wrote her name and tapped on her chest to make first contact with the Aliens. I thought, ""oh no"" please don't tell me your doing the ""me Tarzan, you Jane"" thing. I also read reviews about plot holes. Now, I don't approach movies with the emotion of a wooden stump and methodically dissect their logic. If you do, then maybe heed the warnings of others in your camp. For me, that's where the faults of this movie ends, and the rewards of experiencing this film are far greater. I like films that surprise me, that make me care about the characters and provide a journey. And that doesn't happen that often. Many movies today are so unoriginal. But ""Arrival"" aims to be different. Based on a short story ""Story of Your Life"" by American writer Ted Chiang, director Denis Villeneuve and the rest of the filmmaking team managed to present a poignant, original film unlike any other that I have seen in the science fiction genre. In the end, this isn't a movie about an alien invasion. You'll be disappointed if you expect Will Smith to pop out of an aircraft and knockout an alien with his fist. It's a movie about the human experience and explores such themes as interpersonal communication, life, loss and unconditional love.I had to give this movie it's high score because it deserved it. But also because it definitely does not deserve an extremely low score of 1, 2 or 3. Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and Green Lantern deserve low scores of 1, 2 or 3. This is a much watch for anyone who likes films that make you scratch your head and wonder in utter amazement."

My love for exobiology was big factor in why I loved the Alien design. They seem to be inspired by the aliens from The War Of The Worlds Novel (not any of the movie adaptation aliens) but I don't know for sure. Of course I couldn't make a review without mentioning the best part; The plot twist. Obviously I won't spoil it as this is a non-spoiler review.

",0.7506,0.2144,2018-08-09 00:00:00,7,"Arrival is a beautifully layered approach to the typical sci-fi theme. Much like Adams' character Dr.Banks chiding the scientific Donelly on starting with the basics of communication, the movie seems to be lecturing the genre about the inordinate focus on how aliens look, what their materials are etc and not asking the more basic questions. It conveniently allows the plot to avoid answering those questions, and it works as the viewer is able to suspend judgement on those points. But in focusing on the broader narratives it's let down by the more simple storytelling detail, such as the initial scenes of Whitaker meeting Adams, and the incredulity of Adams learning the aliens language."

Overall though, the film is something that the sci-fi genre needed, an alien movie based on intelligence, not shooting them up. It is worth a watch."

I would have never paid to see this in theater if i knew it was almost a life lesson type of movie. The commercials made this movie seem like an action movie not a personal experience.

" Why are they here?
",0.0,0.9978,2018-08-04 00:00:00,7,"There are some films that tell you a story, and there are some films that impose an idea. ""Arrival"" enters in the list of films that share and impose an idea. Before talking about its idea, I have to say that even though ""Arrival"" is a science fiction drama film, it has nothing to do with classic science fiction examples. Its atmosphere is calm and very much focused on the message it shares. In my opinion ""Arrival"" is one of the best films of 2016 and one of the best science fiction films of all times. It brings an enormous difference to the sci-fi genre. ""Arrival"" chooses communication over action, and this brought the film eight Academy Awards nominations including, Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Achievement in Cinematography. It won only one of them which is Best Achievement in Sound Editing. I don't know the criteria about sound editing or sound mixing but now, when I think about the soundtracks, it makes a perfect sense to me what they mean by sound editing and sound mixing. I have enjoyed the performance of Amy Adams, as a talented linguist, and even though this performance goes unrecognized by the Academy, she manages to get herself a nomination in the Golden Globes for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture Drama. ""Arrival"" is based on 1998 short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang. It is directed by Denis Villeneuve, who is known to be also the director of Incendies, Prisoners and Blade Runner 2049. All these films are in the list of IMDB's top 250 films. Starting with Interstellar and continuing with ""Arrival,"" the change in sci-fi genre has begun and in the near future we can expect more films like this.What would have happened if one day visitors from other planets would come to Earth? How would we communicate with them? Would we attack them, or would we try to talk with them? How would we understand their purpose? What if they are sharing a friendly message and big capitalist countries ignore it? Basically, this is the idea and exit point of ""Arrival."" One day, twelve extraterrestrial spacecrafts land in twelve locations across the earth. No one knows why they are there and what they want. So, US Army recruits a bunch of people including Louise (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), trying to find out one important answer, ""why they have come to earth"" With different attempts, Louise and Ian manage to communicate with the seven-limbed aliens and find out why they came. They came to help humanity by sharing a language which helps perceive the future and the past for those who can master that language. Louise understands the message when she cracks the code and finds out that each twelve spacecrafts share a part of the message, and in order for the message to be perceived, each country must collaborate and share their piece of message. Eventually world unites and when the message is understood, spacecrafts disappear.After writing the story a bit detailed, I would like to share the famous idea of the film. It tells us to unite and gather around one civilization in order to go forward as one. This is of course a utopia, but it still makes you think about its benefits. Using the power of past and future, Louise manages to convince Chinese military general not to attack the aliens. With little efforts the world can unite around a language. ""Arrival"" shows us the probability of this. Some people criticized the film for sharing Neo-Liberal propaganda, but in my opinion, the last thing ""Arrival"" wants to do is propaganda. It is using an interesting subject to share a valuable message. It focuses on the importance of time, communication, language and life. It criticizes globalism which creates the biggest problems on Earth.From performances to the story, from soundtracks to camera angles, ""Arrival"" is a very well-made film. Due to its story, it progresses very slowly, but this is very much expected from a film like this, because it chooses communication over action. If we would learn to communicate before fighting, the world would have been a much better place. This is the most important message that ""Arrival"" shares."

I suppose lots of viewers choose to think that the movie went ""over their heads"". Not so. I just doesn't hold together, that's all. Wasted two hours of my time, as it turned out."
" A bit underwhelming. Gets points for a different kind of alien encounter.
",0.0,0.8841,2018-08-03 00:00:00,6,"This was not the worst movie I've seen. I connected with the linguist and the aliens (to a lesser degree).The lasting effect on the lead character is a tiresome, overplayed concept. The linguist did a decent job at carrying the movie and pulling me into the story. Although I like Forest Whitaker, I am not certain he was the best actor for the role. His quirks and nuances are unique unto him and do not fit well in certain roles. Those same nuances are why I like him in general. Why not make him one of the scientists instead where his quirks may have been a better fit? Just a thought.The alien crafts were very cool in their uniqueness as were the aliens themselves and their method of communication. I would have preferred more exposure to the aliens versus the mental travels of the professor.Reviews are rightfully all over the place (to an extent). I think the extreme (1-2 , 9-10) ratings are not representative of the movie by any fair perspective. I can see a 4 to 8 range of objective ratings. I think it depends on your mood and style preference when you watch this film. A more relaxed mood and nuanced style preference when watching this film might generate a higher rating. A more hyper-mood or need for constant action while watching this film may make it seem more of a disappointment as the action is fairly infrequent. To call this film a 1 or a 10 isn't practical. If you think this is a 10, this means no other movie can top this one and can only, at best, be equally good. If you rate it with 1 star, you are claiming no movie can be worse than this, only equally bad.I think this film was a bit too heavy in the cerebral arena and fails to give enough exposure to the very unique aliens as well as their technology. I would have preferred more glimpses of them and their perspective versus a few cameo appearances."

" The Quiet Brilliance of Arrival
",0.5994,0.9932,2018-07-23 00:00:00,10,"""If you could see your whole life from start to finish... would you change things?""
Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is both a beautiful representation of how far the sci-fi genre has come since the early days, and a conscious and uniquely challenging glimpse at what it truly means to appreciate and respect the values of a life- YOUR life- and what it's all worth living for. I had heard about the movie from several people who urged me to see it simply because ""they knew I would be into it."" From what I could see, it was a mysteriously coded and detailed glimpse into what actual alien contact would be like, how the world at large would perceive it, and how far would we go to be able to understand them and get a sense of what exactly they were here on Earth to do. What I didn't realize is that those things were not actually the true core of the film; what I didn't realize until much much later into the film, is that Arrival is secretly more of a story about humanity than any incomprehensible alien life form. 
What do I mean by this? Well, in observing how the humans in the film deal with various issues brought up in the movie, we begin to examine humanity's faults much more than we do the aliens. These creatures are literally unknowable; the humans don't know anything about them, they can't communicate with them, they have no idea of their intentions. It's up to Amy Adams (in one of her most daring performances yet as Louise) to translate the alien's weird cryptic language and come up with a way to achieve an understanding of how they think so that their purpose can be defined. 
The film delves heavily into the ""Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis,"" or the theory that the structure of a language determines or greatly influences thoughts and characteristics of the culture in which it is spoken, to show that by understanding the language of these immense and complex alien creatures, Louise begins to think like them; she sees what they see, and it turns out that they perceive things in a much different way from how we do, literally having thoughts that exist outside the boundaries of time. In most films that deal with an alien threat through extermination or infiltration, this film is more about connection through language (An extremely relevant topic) and how sometimes things just can't be comprehended, only experienced.
There is a huge twist in this film that talking about would be a disservice to a person's first view of it. I will only say that it is one of the true mind blowing realizations of modern cinema (M Night Shyamalan be damned) and it forces you to rethink EVERYTHING you just watched in the film from start to finish. Arrival is genuinely complex, not in a hipster ""too cool for mainstream"" way or a ""rage against the machine"" way, but SERIOUSLY gets you thinking and wondering how all of this fits together. Ultimately, it asks the question of whether or not it's worth it to give your own life meaning, and what you might choose to do if you realized that many things were in fact meaningless.
Arrival is a film that I recommend you watch by yourself. Yes, it is a film that you might need to have some time to think about afterwards. I only wish to say that I highly recommend Arrival to the questioning mind, to the science fiction enthusiast who cares less about lore and solving every riddle and more about simply enjoying the moments that are being presented to them. 
I am one of those people, and I loved Arrival simply for the experience. It's truly a masterful story that fits together just the right elements of creepy, unsettling, heartfelt, madness and emotion enough to feel very satisfying."

The film also leaves us with a question for ourselves, would we choose to forego the joy of an experience if we knew for certain ahead of time that it would end in great pain. Early in the film, a linguist played by Amy Adams, writes on a white board the sentence, ""What is your purpose for coming here?"" And then proceeds to explain why even such a simple question can't be can't be posed to newly arrived heptapod aliens, who's verbal language sounds a bit like whale song.Unlike any other film I can remember that deals with humans first encountering intelligent extraterrestrials, it presents what would likely be the most realistic scenario for such an event - that is, being aliens to each other the gap between us that we'd need to bridge to establish any communication would be enormous. First, we would need to teach each other how to ""speak"".Throughout the film, Adams' character experiences what we at first believe are flashbacks about a daughter she lost at a young age to a genetic disease. However, we eventually learn they are flash forwards, since as she begins to learn the alien language (which is based on a non-linear concept of time) she begins to think as they do, becoming a cognitive time traveler who can see the future and the past. The child we at first think she remembers losing, she will choose to have in the future.The film unfolds like a dream and its visuals have a dreamlike quality with very little nuts and bolts technology to be seen. These aliens seem almost beyond technology, except they they're housed in vessels (are they really space ships?) that provide a livable environment for them on Earth. When they leave, their vessels simply dissolve into mist."
" Underwhelming
",0.0,0.8413,2018-07-15 00:00:00,5,"Arrival has an interesting premise. Aliens arrive to planet Earth in 12 different spacecrafts with a mysterious mission, and in the US (which is of course the only location that matters in this film), linguist Louise Banks is brought aboard to decipher their language. Meanwhile, Louise seems to be having increasingly intense flashbacks about her daughter who died and husband who left her.I'm not sure if the filmmakers thought linguistics were too difficult for the audience to understand, or if they didn't really understand them either, but apart from a few key moments, the process Louise goes through to learn the aliens' language is vague and opaque. We don't know exactly how she does it, but a montage later, and suddenly she can speak to them in full sentences. How did we go from concrete, observable language (e.g. walk) to being able to communicate abstract concepts (e.g. purpose)? That part is glossed over entirely. It's still an interesting concept, and the circular way in which the aliens write holds an symbolic purpose, but it's not executed as well as it could be.While all of this is going on, there are scenes showing world affairs in response to the aliens (called heptapods). The filmmakers made a decision to involve no real-world political figures in the movie, which was probably for the best, but still manages to be distracting. It's all ""the president"" this, ""the president"" that, and a fictional Chinese general now seems to be leader of the entire Eastern world. News segments come across as corny and forced, as does a fictional rightwing conspiracy theorist. Of course, it's the Eastern world that decides to wage war on the heptapods, those unenlightened brutes, and Louise alone has the power to stop them. This all provides the only context and main conflict of the movie, but it is rather dull and contrived.Then there's the ""flashbacks"" and romance, which are interlinked. Early on, Louise is introduced to physicist Ian Donnelly, who comes across as arrogant, and the two spar a bit. Then they clearly begin to grow on one another. It's a very cliche, albeit subdued (remember, this is a serious film!), romance plot. Ian makes a throwaway line about how language informs our experience of reality (i.e., the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis), which ends up being the key to the whole movie. There's also a key ""flashback"" in which Louise tells her daughter her father is a scientist. While it's all pretty vague, the circular nature of the aliens' language, combined with the fact that Louise has come to think in their language, starts to make it clear that these aren't ""flashbacks."" Ian is her husband, and their daughter dies; because Louise has been given the gift of the heptapods' language, she now sees time as they do, i.e., nonlinearly. Instead of being stuck at a point in time like all humans, she can now see every event in her life unfold. It's a confusing concept, and the film doesn't do much to clarify it.This all is used to solve the problem with that pesky warmongering General Shang, who gives her his phone number during one of her visions and directs her on what she can say to change his mind (which makes it even more ambiguous how time works in this movie--is having a nonlinear perception of time the same thing as being clairvoyant?). Then the heptapods leave, and Louise finally understands the gift they have given to her. Is it a gift? A thoughtful audience will have more questions than answers. Louise continues on with her life, marrying Ian and giving birth to their daughter, because ""it's the journey, not the destination"" (as the cliche goes). She knows Ian will leave her and her daughter, and then the daughter will die from cancer at a young age. Is it really ethical to give birth to someone who will suffer and die at a young age? As deep as it wants to be, the movie doesn't trouble itself with such questions. It's also not clear if Louise has any free will to stop it--after all, the events she sees are already happening (the nonlinear view of time negates the idea of a separate past, present, and future). Does Louise have any free will at all?Arrival is a well-made film from a technical standpoint. The cinematography and soundtrack are excellent. The plot has a lot of potential, and there are some interesting moments therein. However, in the end it doesn't add up to the sum of its parts. Its rather slow, light on detail, and the ending manages to be both predictable and confusing. The ending tries to spin Louise's ""gift"" as a positive, but it's hard to buy it."

" A strong film because it was placed in the right hands
",0.5106,0.995,2018-06-12 00:00:00,8,"I would honestly compare Villeneuve's visceral punching, yet subtle vision-driven storytelling to that of Alejandro Inarritu (The Revenant, Babel, Birdman). If you want simply solid films built with tension and sometimes delivering thought-provoking plots, Villeneuve is a good choice.So what is Arrival? 12 alien spacecraft vessels with strange, black, oval-like shapes touch down (well, they hover above the ground) around the globe. And one of my favorite things about the film is that it knows people don't want 30 minutes of exposition explaining the backgrounds of the charcaters and why they've been chosen; Amy Adams is a skilled linguist professor, and she's headed toward the spacecraft in under 20 minutes with an established background already setup. She is taken there by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) and accompanied by theoretical something physicist with toned muscles Jeremy Renner.One of the strongest aspects of this film-just like the visually stunning 2049-is the logical flow of events in the film. It makes sense why Adams and Renner are needed for communication, and the way they go about everything is just smart and practical. I'd prefer not describing how they interact with the aliens-even if that comprises a large bulk of the movie-but just know that the plot structure is much more sophisticated than a typical Hollywood summer flick.For a film centering around alien contact, it is incredible to see how rooted in humanity the story is. Much of the conflict arises from trust issues from around the globe and especially China's thinning belief that the aliens are here for peaceful reasons. Their turn towards more aggressive tactics and other countries following suit is where the pickup in pacing comes from. And it's also where the film deviates even more from the norm. If you're watching this film in a personalized setting like on your laptop, put some headphones in and crank that volume up. There's a big reason why this film won an Oscar in sound editing; the effects have to be so precise when so much of the plot relies on a linguist trying to figure out how to properly communicate with mysterious aliens that are humorously named Abbott and Costello (Who's on First reference) by Renner. And instead of having a huge, Hans Zimmer score punctuating the action, there's a much more surreal feel from the lack of Johann Johannsson's score (who works with Villeneuve on practically everything). For example, Adams needs to take a breath of fresh air from the stressful work environment, and as she is outside in the beautiful Montana landscape and she reflects on past exposition regarding her family, the touching flashback only has the sound of wind blowing on the tall grass that Adams is sitting in. The minimalist approach brings the audience in closer to this intimate scene, and we hang on every frame.So this is like a masterpiece? Well, not exactly. Again, technically speaking, it's near perfect like how Inarritu is. But that doesn't necessarily translate to simple entertainment value on screen. These are wonderful kinds of films that can be discussed for hours, but that's not the point of this review. To keep it relatively simple, Arrival is a good film that will keep you intrigued for its duration. But you won't really walk out after the credits and be like, ""Wow, that was great!"" Actually, the effect it will have is probably closer to a desire to go get a mocha, sit by a rainy window of a wooden table with comfy, contemporary furniture at that hip coffeeshop that will have a name like The West Side Coffeeshop or Hot Coffee with Cool Friends, and you'll just want to think about life. I will say with about 20 minutes left, the movie had me worried about what strange, complicated direction it was going to take, but then it fooled me and went somewhere else. It's a clever, cool looking film that is logical at every turn (unlike all teenagers in horror movies)-but I'm not sure it's enough to be classified as ""one of the greats.""

Dennis Villenuve shows us why he is the best science fiction director of this generation and Amy Adams is a stand out performance in a movie with many good performances. The writing is on point and the twist is warranted and surprising. I would give this movie a 20/10 if I could.

where to start? hmmm. how about the fact they do not get a consensus either scientifically or linguistically, but instead rely on one person for each.
how about each country handing things on their own instead of a coordinated UN effort.
how about the moron linguist attempting to use a writing board from a great distance with which to communicate instead of just using the board (or some other shape)?
how about not making an effort to speak their language at all? ham-fisted morons, one and all.
how about a bunch of renegade countries deciding to just shoot at them after a brief period of not understanding them? good job, world!
every 10 minutes there was yet another completely illogical and idiotic gaffe.
it is hard to believe that there is now a worse sci-fi film than district 9 and/or avatar, but here you go. i didn't even mention the lame time-bending nonsense. sometimes i really think that the people who say that man did not make it to the moon are correct. maybe we are too stupid to have done so.

",0.0,0.9875,2018-06-06 00:00:00,6,"Arrival, not to be confused with the 1996 Sheen vehicle ""The Arrival"" (also an SF film) is an honest attempt to rise above the typical SF action film or even SF drama, and it succeeds in many places.My problem is just that, as a physicist and someone who speaks 5 languages (but is NOT a linguist by any means), the middle stretches of this film were vaguely unconvincing. So you'll learn a language in a few weeks (or months?) by scribbling abstract words on a white board? You're not even going to start by pointing at reference objects? And mysteriously, you become fluent in no time to the point where you master supra-temporal perception based on language?Or maybe I'm just old-fashioned a la Shakespeare's ""A rose is a rose by any other name,"" and unconvinced that learning a weird new circular language will suddenly make you clairvoyant? Language is powerful, but not that powerful. In the end, words are words, and ink circles are ink circles.The film tries hard to be intellectual, and does not fall far short of it either, so I enjoyed it overall. It's just that I was constantly asking myself ""Really?"" and that sort of interfered with my suspense of disbelief, which any great film has to succeed at. It all felt a little bit too forcé.

Verbal communication turns out to be impossible, and Louise concentrates on visual communication: the aliens use symbols which look like the stains coffee cups leave. Meanwhile, some of the countries hosting the other ships are getting jittery about their guests...Arrival is, I think, going to be the new Matrix. Like The Matrix, I fancy Arrival is going to have a lot of people thinking that it is a masterpiece of cerebral science fiction and, like The Matrix, I think it will turn out to contain a good deal less than meets the eye.Don't let me talk it down too much, though, because it certainly contains some food for thought. The best notion for further examination is that the language you learn in infancy influences the way your thought processes develop, notwithstanding that this was a key concept in Robert Heinlein's Stranger In A Strange Land back in 1961.I felt that this idea (which drives the concept of the perception of time which, in turn, enables the resolution) was never coherently developed, though, and needed to be spelled out a little more clearly, especially as regards how it tied in with the prologue.The international paranoia and local xenophobia angles are far more straightforward, albeit straight out of The Day The Earth Stood Still.The cast are all very good in a film which takes its time to tell a story which, ultimately, is fairly simple. Amy Adams holds centre stage effectively, and Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker provide excellent support. And the visuals are interesting: not especially flashy, but always in service to the story. Denis Villneuve's direction is excellent - I liked this a great deal more than Sicario - and is one of the reasons why people are going to think there is more to this film than there is.I wouldn't go so far as to say that this film is an example of The Emperor's New Clothes, but it may well be a case of The Emperor's New Underpants.

It views its sizeable story through the intimate scope of its central character and thus becomes a much more emotional experience then ever anticipated. By the time certain third-act revelations roll around, each one making you salivate at the thought of a second viewing (which holds up and is a very different experience, I might add), you will have been taken on a personal journey far more impactful than you could've imagined, helped enormously by the flick's phenomenal musical score and unique editing structure, and you'll realise that the story itself was never really about the aliens at all.

I came across such a thing in the form of the 2016 film ""Arrival"" starring Amy Adams. Based on a 1998 short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang, it revolves around linguist Louise Banks (Adams), who is brought before one of twelve strange alien vessels and its equally bizarre occupants with the task of decoding their language in order ask one important question: What is their purpose for coming to Earth? Though small, the cast does a fantastic job portraying characters that are mostly nuanced and relatable. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner especially have great chemistry as they go along this journey of understanding their new visitors, who sport designs and presence that can be best described as, appropriately, ""alien"". The way the creatures communicate is also unique, allowing them to stand out more from your garden-variety extraterrestrials, and the mystery surrounding them is really engaging. The film also pretty much sums up how the world as a whole would react to a situation like this, that is to say going absolutely apes***. In a way, ""Arrival"" is the perfect blend of simplicity and complexity, the basic ideas easy to understand and the details, once understood, enhance the story. The movie challenges you into questioning your place in the universe and how one can contribute to it despite insurmountable odds. In terms of pure sci-fi storytelling, this definitely ranks high on my list."

What's really great about this movie is that all this grandiosity with the aliens is just window dressing to the real plot, which becomes the plot twist at the end... and is both challenging and gut wrenching. We always question ourselves as a species. How many dreams started off on the quest for time travel? To seek answers or to change the past?Truth is, if you knew what was going to happen, you'd be living a curse. You relive the beautiful moments only to know the inevitable demise of it all.The aliens in this film aren't doing anything out of the goodness of their hearts, but because of how they perceive time. And because of that, they are slaves to it. They can never enjoy because they need to solve what is to come.Our freedom is based entirely on our limited understanding of events. Ignorance is the most bliss you'll ever get. If you knew what's going to happen, you can never really enjoy life.And that's the tragedy of Louise...and what she now endures.

It forgoes the worn-out, overused alien movie script of: Aliens arrive, humans contact aliens, aliens attack humans, humans fight back and win against overwhelmingly stupid odds that seems to come out every other year. Instead, the film asks the question of ""What if extraterrestial life came to Earth NOT to mindlessly kill everything? What if, instead, they came for a mysteriously greater purpose that our two species must learn to communicate in order to understand?"" And it is a question that makes for one constantly tense, suspenseful ride that leaves you uncertain until the very end. I do not understand the negative reviews claiming it to be boring. My only guess is that the people who find Arrival boring would prefer a Michael Bay CGI-explosion filled Independence Day remake; this time, with TRANSFORMERS! However, if you are a person who enjoys experiencing a great story, rather than watching a two hour action sequence, you should give Arrival a look."

",0.2732,0.9063,2018-04-05 00:00:00,7,"I don't really want to jump into a plot review of this movie, because it is VERY original. All I can say about that is the movie does deliver in specific areas, but I would not agree that it is 100% original. Where this movie lands for me is the cinematography. They did a jaw dropping job. Simple still shots of characters are very fleshed out and unique. The editing, and pacing are also well done. This movie stands out to me on an extremely strong technical side, but the story to it is kind of dependent on the viewer."

" A tad over-rated
",0.0,0.9758,2018-03-29 00:00:00,6,"The state of Montana is one of twelve places in the world where alien aircrafts have landed. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a renowned linguist who is recruited to study and interpret the language used by the aliens. She is assisted by a renowned scientist played by Jeremy Renner.""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" will likely always be the benchmark for this genre (UFOs, alien landings). ""Arrival"" is a competent film with fine moments but it doesn't feel engaging enough to fill its almost two hours. Indeed, the acting is good and the story is interesting though maybe a bit far-fetched. It also seems to borrow from ""Gravity"" in which the heroine has a similar difficult past.The photography of this film is usually in dark tones. The interior scenes always have different levels of darkness. The outdoors scenes are mostly night-time, nightfall, just before dawn, or overcast days. The choice of maintaining darkness is interesting but after a while, it tends to keep the viewer at a distance.SPOILER ALERTWell, it's sort of a spoiler. After the release of ""The Martian"" last year, someone astutely pointed out that that film and ""Gravity"" were big-budget Hollywood sci-fi films that involved international co-operation, especially from China, in the rescue attempts. This good image of China seemed to be a way to draw Chinese film-goers to the movie. In ""Arrival"", when it became apparent that China was, yet again, involved in an international effort, it was easy to predict one of the outcomes."
" Guiness Book of Records: Talking to Aliens for 90 minutes long
",0.0,0.9968,2018-03-29 00:00:00,6,"Those who believe in paranormal activity will enjoy this story about Amy Adams who is trying to talk to aliens that landed on earth. But when you are looking for some fast scifi action movie stay far far far away from this picture, because it is all dreamy paranormal talk with aliens. It is acted ok. The visuals and soundtrack are ok. All in all just a good sci fi flick, but not excellent. What makes ""Arrival"" special is the suspense. Really good suspense I must admit, because the director does keep this story thrilling. In ""Arrival"" there is this big mystery that has to be unravelled of how to communicate with aliens. And Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are the scientists who have to fulfill this task. The different attempts to contact the aliens are portrayed in a fascinating claustrophobic tense atmosphere. Villeneuve also directed the new Blade Runner and he knows how to glue an audience to a screen even when not much is happening. Villeneuve has a great talent for creating a contineous suspenseful mood. A strange thing happened the day after I saw it. The scenes with Amy Adams encountering the aliens stayed in my mind the day after. Somehow director Villeneuve's claustrophobic mood lingered on even the next day. In the end I felt the story was a little too much paranormal and a bit too sweet for my taste.But the suspenseful mood of the movie is impressive. It is a hit or miss depending on your preferences for paranormal stuff and how rational you analyse movies. Villeneuve's direction splits audiences in half, more so than any other director.However smart it is filmed and however suspenseful it stays, it becomes too irrational for my taste near the end, but I dont believe in paranormal stuff, maybe you do...The message of love however is what makes this movie heartfelt and warm in the end. It's honestly a feelgood movie, but you must be the patient type and have a very open mind to paranormal stuff to be able to appreciate it."

I loved the story a lot but didn't feel connected to Adams or Rener (who I normally adore them both). The dreams were unnecessary in my opinion and it is just that, an opinion. I would've been much more satisfied if we could have explored the philosophy more. That being said, I feel this film is a must see because for all the points I mention above, they are outweighed by the story itself."

The movie is all about the story and the ending is both an exciting and, at least for me, an unexpected surprise. Do we stop ourselves from loving because we know it will bring us the most enormous pain or do we go ahead and make the most of the present because no matter what the future holds love in the present will always beat pain and suffering in the future"

Too often films try to fill empty spaces with empty scenes. Until close to the end I was conflicted. I couldn't understand why those little ""flashback"" scenes were splattered at random emotional times, but I felt that I could let the cheesiness slide because I love brevity. Sometimes we should try not think when watching films. It cripples the experience. Apart from the thinking/analyzing, I was enjoying the film. I haven't read any other reviews yet, so I am not sure what the general feeling towards the film is but it's an enjoyable and well adapted science-fiction story. I love the film as a science-fiction fan and love the way Villeneuve refers to it as ""dirty sci-fi."""

" If you want a horror movie, don't watch
",-0.5267,0.9913,2018-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Arrival, a science fiction movie, depicting a situation where alien beings visit multiple locations on earth for a reason previously unknown. This movie looks into different reactions that could occur to an unexpected greeting by other species from outside Earth. The protagonist of the story experiences a dream consisting of ""memories"" of events that she does not yet know at the beginning of the movie, foreshadowing the events that are yet to come. When these strange creatures, octopods, appear on Earth and present to the humans a language that normal people can't comprehend, the group of scientists, and even military personal, call this main character to help to comprehend their language and learn what they want. These creatures think differently than people on Earth. Their way of thinking is almost backwards from humans. They know the outcome, but don't know the inbetweens that the outcome takes, whereas we know the inbetweens, but don't know the outcome.This movie shows many incidents of miscommunication, fear of a new species, and the destruction of one side due to a lack of communication. We see many abstract perspectives in this movie and explore the difficulties we as humans have when meeting a new species, not knowing their intentions or background. We very often judge before looking into things, which causes much more damage than there needs to be. Unlike the rest of the task force involving the octopods, the protagonist does everything she could to learn about this new species and to understand their language. In doing so, she developes the ability to think as the octapods do. She was able to see the outcomes of the actions she will make in the future and was able to maniulate this way of thinking in order to save the octapods and let the, safely leave Earth.I really liked this movie because it brought many concepts and current problems affecting relationships, like differing perspectives, understanding one another, communication, and even tackled the popular imaginary situation of learning about the future in order to choose a better life for yourself. This imaginary concept is shown when the protagonist learns of the sad future that is held in store for her, she decides to accept it instead of changing it to a perfect situation. This movie really sparked many thought provoking questions, especially about communication and understanding between to parties. The way in which they portrayed these issues was very clever, since many people look to the skies for communicating organisms out in the universe, ""waiting for us"".Many people who wrote bad reviews about this movie haven't taken the movie into a deeper level, only scraping the surface and accusing the toppings. This movie deserves much more appreciation than these people are giving it.One of the reviews says, ""my grand daughter could have drawn more convincing and frightening aliens than the highly paid special effects bods did."" I think this person mistook Arrival for a horror movie because this movie obviously is one of the more realistic sci-fi movies out there. Obviously this person doesn't know anything because space is definitely not only made of scary creatures lingering in empty space. This movie was a portrayal of a more gentle species than humans and wanting to help us in order to help them. What part of help is supposed to be horror? It is really triggering how this person expects every sci-fi movie to be exactly like the one before.At least the writer of the next review understood the part that these obviously gentle creatures weren't here to be scary and frightening, but ""came to earth because they will need our help in the future so they give us the ability to 'think' like them to see time as a whole"" The one thing this reviewer didn't get was that the time travel aspect of the movie was not where the movie fell apart, it was where the whole concept was glued together. In this part of the movie, she has learned to 'think' like the octapods, seeing the result before the process of her life. And this person didn't understand the reason why the octapods came to us for help. It was because unlike humans who can understand the process for an unknown outcome (our life), these octapods know the end result, but don't know how to get there, so they take things one step at a time as it comes to them."
" Not for you if you're into *scary* aliens (you'd give it 1*), so stay away
",0.0,0.7598,2018-03-04 00:00:00,10,"It seems a lot of the reviewers that gave this movie 1 star were expecting to see a typical *scary* Hollywood movie about aliens. By typical I mean something that features incredibly ill-tempered creatures with goo dripping out of their every orifice, whose only purpose in life is to hurt, eat and destroy us puny humans. Usually they are after our incredibly precious resources (which apparently are very rare in an almost infinite universe), really anxious to investigate the intricacies of our body parts, or some such ridiculous nonsense. So, if you happen to be one of those people, you better stay away because you'd be really disappointed and bored (and there are no big explosions too). Don't get me wrong, I like ""Alien"" and movies in that vein which are really well made (definitely not ""Prometheus""). But ""Arrival"" is not this type of a movie.""Arrival"" is mostly a (philosophical) drama with elements of sci-fi. It is a thinking person's movie and a lot of the reviewers really didn't understand some parts of the movie - and I don't mean metaphors or *deep stuff*, but things that were really there. Maybe they were bored or didn't care, it doesn't matter.If you're into asking big questions and you really enjoy thinking about why things are as they are, you'll probably enjoy this movie. It is really well made. The original story of Ted Chiang is also quite good..."
" A Nearly Perfect Film
",0.5719,0.9911,2018-03-02 00:00:00,9,"I'm not really a sci-fi fan so I was not in a huge rush to see this movie. I can't believe I waited. It is simply a beautiful film about just how simultaneously small and large we are in relation to the universe. The acting is superb, the script is taut and the directing is on the mark. The special effects look realistic (which is rare these days with CGI so prevalent) and the storyline progresses in a smart manner.Amy Adams is a linguistics professor named Louise. Jeremy Renner is a physicist named Ian. They are recruited by Col Weber (Forest Whitacker) when 12 alien ships arrive across the globe. The idea being they will be able to make contact with the aliens and translate their intentions. The aliens seem to have benevolent intentions, but of course the military and intelligence agencies have to justify their existence. There is also a renegade Chinese General who wants to attack the spaceships and possibly start a global war.The ships are well designed. The reverse gravity affect was pretty cool. (The aliens bear a strong resemblance to alien characters on the Simpsons.) 
Eventually, Louise and Ian start deciphering the aliens' language which appear as smoky symbols on a glass barrier. This, too, was handled well as Louise starts to understand that their language consists of symbols and not letters like English. The movie does an amazing job of conveying how difficult it might be to communicate with other life forms should we ever make contact. The expressions the aliens use are misinterpreted and Amy and Ian have to rush to stop a global disaster. Throughout the film, Louise is having visions of her daughter. This is central to the plot and when you understand the non-gimmicky twist (another rare thing in movies these days), the movie takes on a whole new dimension. You can watch it a second time and see an entirely different film.What I liked most about the film is it has a real easy going pace. The science is handled well and easily understandable. The actors are great and the concept of actually trying to understand another lifeforms view of reality was awesome.I rated this movie a 9. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is some of the characters were extremely one-dimensional and just seemed tacked on to provide some contrived tension. The intelligence officer and some of the soldiers are an example. Otherwise, this movie was fantastic."

" A true movie masterpiece
",0.7845,0.9265,2018-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Arrival remains my favorite movie of 2016 and is probably my second all time favorite after Contact. It's a perfect movie packed with a thirst for answers; an adventure that keeps asking what's next, although giving you clues in front of your eyes right from the beginning. The emotional weight it carries is conveyed masterfully by the lead actress, using mostly just her body language, all orchestrated by the brilliant director Denis Villeneuve in conjunction with an outstanding soundtrack and a sombre but eye striking cinematography. Athough the core of the movie is finding means of communication with an alien civilization, the whole picture asks a more important question: ""If you saw your life from start to finish, would you change anything?""."
" Interesting concept, but a failure in execution
",-0.5574,-0.9167,2018-02-24 00:00:00,3,"I'm going to focus on one aspect in my review as I feel it's the worst aspect of the movie and really lets it down; the script. It's truly awful.
It also spoils the portrayal of the characters, as statements come out of their mouths that no-one with an IQ above 90 would utter, let alone a scientist.
The military characters are all lazy stereotypes, their stupidity and impatience only there for exposition and to move the plot along. Forrest Whitaker's character at one point can't understand the difference between translating a well known human language with an alien one (also why is he trying to do a bad Bostonian accent?)
My PhD was in a project related to astrophysics and I didn't recognise any qualities in the scientists on screen with real life. Maybe it's too boring to portray scientists as they are, but I think The Martian did an OK job of it (leaving aside other issues with that movie)
There is some antagonism between the social and hard sciences in real life, but some of the exchanges between Amy Adams' and Jeremy Renners' character were excruciating. She says language is the foundation of civilisation, he contradicts and says it's science. That's just wrong and anyone with an inkling of history wouldn't make the claim that it's science as the scientific method was quite a late innovation in humanity's history.
I wanted to like this movie, but I found it truly exasperating."

" Not for everyone, but definitely for me.
",0.5499,0.9499,2018-02-13 00:00:00,9,"Ambiguous, serious, thoughtful - this film may be slow-paced, but at no point was I bored. In my view, the science was mostly plausible; the fact that it wasn't entirely plausible was made up for, in my opinion, by the uniqueness of the ideas dealt with in the film, when compared to others of similar genre. As some other reviews say, this film is about aliens, but it is also about language, communication and the incredible differences in perception that could exist between different species. I think this last point could be explored even further than is done so in the film.At the time of writing, Arrival has an Amazon rating of 3.5 stars - I'm used to filtering through things to watch based on their rating, so this almost slipped my view. I'm glad it didn't. I'm now reconsidering the weighting I place on average ratings - a director who is brave enough to do something different will tend to get quite a few low ratings as well as high ones, just by virtue of the experimental nature of their work. (In this regard, I see parallels to Blade Runner: 2049, which I saw before Arrival, and was actually quite a fan of, although I like Arrival even better.)"

" Not for some...
",0.0,-0.3503,2018-02-08 00:00:00,6,"Well, it's only a film, let's face it. And does it really matter? I suppose at the end of the day it doesn't.If anyone is actually interested in this from a sci-fi point of view what I'm going to say will be a spoiler. Actually, that's the interesting rub. It doesn't matter because this film is so opaque that knowing what it's about before you start is the only way you're going to understand it. So I'm doing you a favour.If as I did, you just start watching it (I knew vaguely it was about aliens arriving, language, etc etc, but not much more than that) then you're going to be thoroughly confused, disappointed, and in the end cynical.I jest not. I'm not completely foolish and I want a film to succeed and be good - obviously, if even for my own sake - but I couldn't help starting to laugh and make comments to myself. It had that effect. Which is a very bad sign.I don't know if all the people who've raved about this film knew the premise of it before they started or not. If you know that the first scene isn't present day but technically the future you might feel better. But you don't. Or I didn 't.If the idea of the film is to severely challenge our ideas of linear time then it succeeds, no question. That is its forte, and very well it does it. However, if as a human being, you want to feel human and enjoy the film then you need to connect with the characters. All great films and stories have done this. They draw you into their characters' lives, you begin to know them, and to know them is to love them.But here, there's no backstory. I have no idea who the woman was. I have/had no idea who the man was. I do know that the chemistry between them was non-existent. You will realise the absurdity of this when you see it. On the other hand it might have been the whole point, but that doesn't make for a good film.There's also the usual predictable Hollywood idea of visiting aliens to be confronted by the stupid military who only want to shoot things because they're frightened and ignorant. Like those isolated tribes in the jungle who won't let you near them and fire bows and arrows at helicopters and strangers. For some reason we're always portrayed as ignorant, frightened savages and aliens as the enemy, a threat, to be approached with both hands on a hair trigger.Of course, the hero of the day is always the one with a tad more guts and initiative who actually behaves normally and goes to see what's happening instead of cowering behind a tank. Well, obviously. But I digress.So, if you're prepared for the usual stupid 'Let's just shoot them' attitude from the military, a very, very vague meeting and contact with strange creatures from somewhere else, your sense of reality to be jiggered about to the point of invoking sarcastic comments, and no human feeling whatsoever from or between the characters (except maybe mother and daughter but it doesn't last), then you'll love it.Personally I wanted very much to enjoy it. I like my sci-fi films; I like that kind of thing and I'm good at scientific/philosophical ideas (Interstellar was no problem) but I couldn't. In fact I was driven to sarcasm, and that's a very bad sign.But the film's had awards, a 94% rating on one movie board, critics eulogising over it, so maybe they knew something I didn't. I know I spent the whole film in a warp trying to connect with the characters and not succeeding because there was nothing to connect with.As for language and/or linguistics, forget it. The author's a Chinese American. I have a feeling that the real underlying motive is about a Chinese person feeling like an discombobulated alien in America whose people don't understand language character-symbols and we're all having communication troubles. Build on that the old, worn cliche about humanity having to be saved from itself then you've got it. But only badly and vaguely because even that is not an act of mercy, it's a trade-off, an investment in an unseen future. (When the future is convenient to the story it really is the future, otherwise it's all mixed up).What's wrong with this whole thing is there's no love in it, therefore there's no real film experience. At least ET and Close Encounters made you cry a bit. At least you were rooting for the guys in Interstellar. The same thing with Gravity, awful though it was. Here, the only star interest is some extremely cerebral, and therefore disconnected, idea of time distortion - and, frankly, who cares. But at least it's got me talking about it. But probably only because it's mysterious. Which might be a polite word for confusing.So, if you're going to see it, be aware that it doesn't start in the nice sensible present like a proper story, you're watching the future, except they don't tell you that. Just bear in mind that events as they unfold may not be linear and you might, just might, get through it without laughing. Maybe.Unfortunately, or fortunately, there is a serious element to it too because time may not be very linear depending on your mindset... but we better not get into that."
" Technically and Emotionally Beautiful
",0.5994,0.9727,2018-02-06 00:00:00,9,"Arrival is a film that you have to watch more than once to take in all it's brilliant use of timing. Throughout the movie, the audience is exposed to several different scenes, taking place in the past, present, and future, and we have to puzzle together how it impacts the main character and the overall story. We are taken on a breathtaking journey as we start off in the life of a lonely linguistics professor who gets the opportunity of a lifetime to get to communicate with aliens. Director Denis Villeneuve makes the audience feel the overwhelming emotion that the characters experience through his use of imagery - from the warm, intimate flashbacks in calming scenery, to the cold and foreign environment at the army base and aboard the alien aircraft. We are introduced to the main character, Louise, through a series of scenes about the tragic death of her daughter. Scenes like this one crop up throughout the movie and the audience is frequently reminded of why Adams's character seems to be so emotionally drained. There seems to be a disconnect between Louise's visions and what is happening in the present. We don't know why Louise is having these visions or how they shape her or the story. It is not until the truth about why she is having these visions is revealed that we understand their importance. Flashbacks are typically used in films to give us background for a character or plot line, so that we are filled in on knowledge we would not otherwise have. The flashbacks in this film seem to have little context within the present plot of the movie, other than affecting Louise's mood in a negative way. Instead of being giving the audience the power of omniscience, we feel as though we are even further from knowing the truth than the characters are. That is, until it is revealed that Louise is just as in the dark about these visions as the audience. This reveal allows us to be thrown back in the the first person perspective of Louise as we are by her side, trying to solve this mystery together.Another stunning use of film technique in this film was the mis-en-scène aboard the aliens' aircraft. When Louise and Ian are communicating with the aliens, the scene is framed around the window that separates aliens and humans. The aliens are caged and isolated by this frame, with the humans on the outside, looking in. Other scenes of the window show a side-by-side with Louise on one side and the aliens on the other, showing a closer connection between them than the military, or even Ian have with the aliens. Even the lack of color in the alien communication scenes play an important role, giving the ominous and mysterious feel the environment. Both the frame and black and white color scheme make the alien vessel feel separated from the outside world, as well as fully emerging the viewer into the scene. The cut-off view of the aliens also plays an important role in the placement of the scene. Whenever Louise and Ian go up into the vessel to communicate with the aliens, they are only able to see the bottom half the aliens through the limited window space. This creates a sense of mystery, and even fear, surrounding these aliens. When Louise is later transported individually into the vessel, she is allowed inside the alien's own compartment, where she is able to see their entire bodies. By taking away the mystery, the fear also disappears, even though we see how giant these creatures are. Louise forms a closer connection to these beings as now the physical and conversational barriers have been taken away. My only complaint from this film is that some moments can be needlessly cheesy. The love interest between Louise and Ian feels unnecessary, its only purpose being to rope in the flash forwards of Louise's daughter into the story by giving her a father, not really a connection the story needed. The purpose of the aliens being to give us a ""gift"" of communication so that the human race will help them later also seems a bit far fetched and feel-good. In spite of all that, neither of these aspects distracted from the overall brilliance and wonderment of the film.There are so many things that made this movie so entertaining to watch - from the concept of the story, to the emotion of the characters, to the bewilderment that the audience experiences from start to finish. Nothing in this movie happens by accident - every scene has a purpose and is a piece of the puzzle that is not completed until the very end, and that is what makes this film such a beautifully crafted masterpiece."
" When Independence Day meets Interstellar! (no spoilers)
",0.0,0.9841,2018-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie because it was in my 2017 oscar highlights list and I gave it a try to see how it is. Arrival is directed by Denise Villeneuve who also directed Blade Runner 2049 (which I didn't like at all) and tells the story of a linguistic teacher who is hired by the military to try to communicate with the arrived aliens.Honestly I was skeptical about this movie having watched Blade Runner 2049 some months ago and at the same time I was realistic and opened for this movie to maybe blow me away. I was constantly intrigued and amazed by this movie. This movie for me is without a doubt the best movie of 2016 along with Hacksaw Ridge. Is a very thoughtful movie with a very deep message that at the same time manages to surprise the viewer in ways that you couldn't even imagine. At the beginning I was intrigued by the concept of aliens arriving on earth and how would it be to try to communicate with them but the movie really took me in directions I didn't expect and rewarded my patience throughout the runtime. Let's start with Amy Adams' performance which was mesmerizing and one of her best in recent movies. She was calm relaxed and almost effortlessly pulled this character with so much depth and motivation. I can't understand why she wasn't nominated for an oscar. Emma Stone did not have a overwhelmingly better performance than Amy's considering the fact that Adams did this in a sci-fi movie and Emma did it in a musical. It is disturbing to see her too (after Matthew McConaughey for Interstellar) being robbed of a Oscar nomination in her case by Maryl who was probably nominated only for being a Hollywood legend like Denzel in the same year(because the next year she was nominated again). Next, the visuals are outstanding but compared to Jungle Book they couldn't match those. The score was great... a very haunting score that suited almost every scene. The story is absolutely fantastic. It reminded me a little about Interstellar's story and it kinda resembles to that in way. It has the emotional pump by the end just like Interstellar did and it also has twist and turns you wouldn't expect in a sci-fi like this. Another thing I liked was the realism in it. Just like in interstellar it starts with scientifical concepts and then takes turns and new directions that go in the sci-fi realm and actually surprised me a lot. There are also flashbacks which in the beginning seemed unnecessary but by the end went full-circle and had such a tremendous impact on me. No point trying to point out the directing and cinematography which are all fantastic. I have only two gripes with the movie and that is spoiler territory which I'll address bellow, but aside from that this movie is flawless and is so similar with Interstellar that for me is impossible to not like it and consider it one of the best sci-fi ever.***SPOILER HERE***
So the thing that bothered me was that the movie never fully explained who were the aliens and why they'll need human help in 3000 years. The second and last thing that bothered me was that in the end the aliens and Louise were able to talk so easily with each other despite the fact that they spend more than half the time of the movie trying to learn each other's language.
***END OF SPOILERS***Aside from that this movie is awesome and mind-blowing with fantastic performances and great story. It amazes me how this movie got nominated for best picture, director, adapted screenplay, cinematography, production and sound and Interstellar didn't receive any nominations for cinematography, directing or motion picture since they are pretty much the same thematical movies. 10/10"
" Too much honey on the cherry on top of the cake
",0.2023,0.9821,2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"The best of this trilogy of science fiction films for the end. This film is in many ways a very good film that deals with the arrival of aliens on earth and their first contact with human beings. It shows a little bit of the panic it creates on earth, like the evangelists and other apocalyptic prophets who announce the end of this world; then the jingoist bigots who require the extermination of these aliens from the very start to protect the human species. ETC. There is no end to human folly. But at this level of the human response to twelve alien space crafts levitating in twelve places in the world, the film shows how easy the jingoists can win. The American side that started an intelligent mission to communicate with the aliens thanks to the help and competence of a linguist and a physicist, is also the first one shown as trying to blow up the spacecraft, which fails because the aliens detect the explosive and neutralize the bombs that explode within the spacecraft but with no damage caused.The film insists on the fact that China, then Russia, then Sudan and Pakistan (I might be wrong on this fourth one) want to destroy the space crafts because they apparently misunderstood a message in the alien language and script. Only the American side of the linguistic communication is provided, though the film alludes to linguistic experts on the Chinese side. It is funny because the writing system is what looks like absolutely arbitrary scribbles and ink stains. The linguist manages to make everyone understand that these circles are words, and the physicist using some software manages to isolate some of these words, though we might think that a circle could be more than one concept and thus be a sentence.But it is when that communication is becoming successful that the paranoia wins in the American camp as well and as fast as in the other camps in the world. It is an impossible and incredible act of rebellion of the linguist that avoids the worst end possible. She steals the phone of the top commander of the camp on the American site and she calls the General, head of the Chinese Liberation Army, and tells him what she thinks about the communication, and it all in Chinese, which is, of course, an advantage over all the military personnel who speaks one language, and even so quite often a dialect of this language, i.e. English. The effect is immediate. The Chinese general steps back and the military confrontation is avoided.The end is a marshmallow in a fire. It melts down to some kind of sloppy sweet honey-covered soft candy and the aliens just dissolve their space crafts into thin air. And they go away. That's what I call real adventurous explorers. Then some mellow personal ending and touch to have the good Hollywoodian - or should I say Hollywoodistic, or even Hollywoosadistic - happy ending with love, marriage, birth, etc. But remember! In all vast questions, it is always the linguist - especially if the linguist is a woman and if possible a structuralist - who knows better for a simple reason: there is no science if an articulated language does not exist FIRST. How could Homo Sapiens conceive the concept of ZERO if he did not have a language that had permitted his conceptualization power to develop? And the Mayas, the Chinese and later the Arabs, but probably some anterior communities in the Middle East, developed that ZERO without any communication among them, at least for the Chinese and the Mayas who did it first. And that ZERO will be imported into Europe by Descartes in the 17th century: ""al gèbre"" as he called it.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
" A Sci-fi must-see.
",0.0,0.9752,2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"This one is for sure one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. It's a full package, a great plot, screenplay and meanfully story, Oscar's worth sound effects, and an achievement on directing. It's messenge by criticising nowadays human relations and forgetting simple things like dialogue and comprehension is beautiful. Whatsmore, it's not just a typical story about alien invasion, but a story about a mother and her strugglings for her proufound love, which feeling Amy Adams captures with a deep acting. Obligatory must-see. ABUSOLUTELY LOVE IT."
" ""Trying to understand us since the Tower of Babel"".
",0.0,0.9506,2018-01-30 00:00:00,10,"This film gave me something that I had been waiting for a long time. I would like to make a counterpoint with my personal story, very well, when I was looking for motivational videos, still very young, it was common to feel lost, even more with by the type of creation I was subjected to, so i was looking for something that would serve me as elucidation. to help me get somewhere, to help me believe, so i found a video subtitled because it is North American and also because I am south american, naturalized Brazilian and had a very tenuous knowledge about the Anglo-Saxon language, well, as I had said, when i watched this video and i listen a voice that seemed familiar to me, not only did it look like it was! The icon behind it? nothing less than Steve Jobs, founder of one of today's largest companies.I stopped, and I listened attentively to the sign that passed and said exactly like this: ""You can not connect the dots looking forward; you can only turn them on by looking back. So you have to trust that the points will connect sometime in the future. You have to trust in something - your instinct, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach never disappointed me, and it made all the difference in my life"". So this not only made a difference to him, but I believe that for all who have listened to him and believe in these words. I always believed that the words are very powerful, and we must be careful, for they have powers hitherto unknown to us humans, they are responsible for all kinds of communication, the communication that allows us to teach, which convey a tremendous emotional charge, many deep-seated feelings, Jesus said to love one another and, is there a better way to do this than to rid our brothers of chaos, confusion, and consequently destruction? The language sometimes confuses our thoughts, they limit us in all aspects.I am not surprised at the importance of being buried after the separation in the tower of Babel, we must ""understand ourselves"" before we can correct ourselves, there is no way to solve the ""PROBLEM"" without first understanding it, therefore communication makes this fundamental, unite the dots""."
" Just a solid movie
",0.1531,0.7184,2018-01-30 00:00:00,8,"This is a creative and unique take on the aliens have arrived movie cliche. I don't have much to say other than, it is a solid movie and if you like science fiction you should give it a watch."
" Stunning
",0.3818,0.762,2018-01-29 00:00:00,7,"It's visually appealing, stunning, and so worth the money to see in theatres. I was there were more sci-fi movies like this."
" Moving and intelligent
",0.4588,0.9939,2018-01-29 00:00:00,8,"I'm staggered that a good number of people have seen fit to rate this movie as a 1 star offering, and feel sorry for them that they got so little out of the film. Just because a sci fi movie doesn't offer up interplanetary war, goggle-eyed green aliens, laser guns and space ships that can turn a profit in lego sales does not make it dull!This is a thought provoking film richly deserving of a second viewing and offers a welcome alternative to the regular, formulaic star wars type sci fi offerings. If it's a movie 'for the rest of us' then so be it!It has it's flaws of course - the actions of the rebellious soldiers is a little hard to believe, and the breakdown of trust among nations and proposed aggression from the Chinese - while believable given the daft world we live in - is rather underdeveloped. But all the film's faults are only faults if you lose sight of the fact that this is a story about Louise. It is Louise, her life, and the decision she must make about her daughter that is the film's focus, not the aliens, space ships, guns or governments. That, presumably, is why those aspects of the story are a little lightweight - to make more room for Louise's story.The film does play deliberate and clever tricks with what is past, present and future. I'm not very good at understanding the 'wibbley wobbley timey wimey' stuff (most episodes of Dr Who leave me confused enough!), so I was not surprised that I didn't quite get the film on first viewing. But it left me with questions I needed answering, and the answers were there on second viewing. As too was a good deal more emotion and involvement. Watching it for a second time, having twigged the correct order of things and what was coming in Louise's life decision, I found the film deeply engaging and emotional. For example I appreciated much more the beautiful filming of Louise with her daughter Hannah, and I was fully in tune with the unfolding of the story. I rather like the fact that I needed to visit the film twice to fully grasp it, as ultimately that proved much more rewarding.If you're looking for a good old fashioned western-in-space shoot-em-up film this will certainly let you down. Get something trashy, predictable and shallow like like Independence Day on DVD instead. But if you want to watch an intelligent film about a mother's love for her daughter (with some aliens thrown in for decoration) then this might just do it for you. A do watch it twice :)"

Pretty good message but I would have enjoyed to see all the military being crushed. I'll refrain from telling the story because it is worth watching. It is well thought and I liked it. I disagree with many details and agree with many more. Hence, more better stories are to come. I can almost see them already. I know it and I will enjoy them nevertheless."
" The theme of Arrival
",0.0,0.4485,2018-01-20 00:00:00,6,"Arrivel has a great direction and acting. It has memorable scenes as the scene of the protagonist's first encounter with the aliens. Yet I do not understand the great acceptance he has been having.
Two excerpts made me very uncomfortable with that film:
There are problems related to communication between the leaders of each country and the soldiers who are in service. Many times the dialogues are forcibly difficult just to move the plot to other places. At least for me the dialogues were poorly written
Another problem I see is the fact that the death of a loved one came back at the end of the story and having an important weight, this made me question the real theme of the film. Is it a film about translation, understanding and above all a new way of understanding of life as a whole as the main character has? Or is it a movie about accepting a loss, being able to accept life as it is? What relationship can we establish between the whole main plot involving communication between aliens and humans and the story of loss of the main character? I understand the point of how she sees the past, present and future with the memories she has of her daughter, but still the story of the daughter seems to me disconnected with the plot of the film."
" It's drama, with a Sci-Fi backdrop
",0.0,-0.9824,2018-01-18 00:00:00,7,"If you want to see some great Sci-Fi about a linguist and a scientist attempting to communicate with aliens...that movie hasn't been made yet.***spoilers begin here***This movie is simply about a woman who learns that her future daughter will die early of cancer as a teen. Even knowing this, she chooses to have her daughter anyway. The times they shared together were worth the pain and loss yet to come.The backdrop of aliens, language, science and time are simply a set up for allowing the woman to see the future. Nothing more. If the movie were to be rated as a Sci-Fi film it would receive poor ratings - as evidenced by reviews saying as much. This point is where the marketers of the movie missed the mark. There are a few Science Fiction elements and some moments that are interesting in that aspect, but the science of the movie is too...fictional. The actions of the world-wide scientists and leaders is not believable and the role of Renner as a scientist is underutilized (dare say...not utilized at all). The linguistic methods of deciphering the language are glossed over and the science behind the methods not even mentioned.But again, this isn't really Sci-Fi. Were the movie in a different setting away from Aliens Arriving on Earth, there would be fewer criticisms. Reviewing the movie as a drama about the decisions of a future mother-to-be gives a better representation of the film's content. In that aspect, it is a difficult, heart-wrenching drama that makes the viewer question the judgment of the character since she knew what the outcome would be.Was the daughter being born a requirement for the future to work out correctly 3000 years from then? The movies suggests not. Then was Adam's character self-serving to have the child even though the child would die an early death through disease? Would the child prefer to have lived even knowing her own future?Renner's character leaves the family when he finds out Adams knew the daughter would die. He tells her that ""She made the wrong decision.""It's up to the viewer to choose what is right."
" Best Sci-Fi Film of 2016
",0.6369,0.9804,2018-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Arrival was one of the most original and ingenious science fiction films I've seen in a long time.I had high hopes for it before it's release as I'd read it was directed by Denis Villeneuve and, having watched Prisoners, I was already aware of his capabilities as a filmmaker. Plus I noticed the film had a 100% Rotten Tomatoes approval score following it's premiere. I doubted it would last (it didn't) but I knew it was a promising sign.And when I watched it in the cinema, I was not disappointed. Arrival is one of those films that I would describe as being 'a classic story with a unique twist'. Aliens coming to Earth? That's nothing new. Earth is practically a tourist hot spot for extra-terrestrials. But there have never been any sci-fi films before where the focus has been on communication and language. That may sound boring to some but I was absolutely gripped the whole time.Although the plot twist towards the end is very memorable, the best moment for me is the first encounter. The darkened setting of the spaceship, Jóhann Jóhannsson's astonishing music score, the breathtaking sound effects and the slow reveal of the aliens gives a recipe that I would class as sci-fi gold.After watching the film, I decided to read the story upon which it was based and that made me appreciate it even more. The reason being is that there are actually very few similarities between the story and the film which gave me a real eye opener as to just how well Eric Heisserer had done crafting the screenplayOverall, an absolutely smashing film and certainly a must for any hardcore science-fiction fan"
" A film that will enter your dream life
",0.25,0.9287,2018-01-15 00:00:00,9,"This remarkable work does much more than dazzle with special effects as it carries with it a dark and bitter concoction of melancholy and longing with it's tragic female lead and mind-blowing reach into philosophy and physics, linguistics and psychology that made for me a deeply affecting piece. I'm not a great fan of slimey alien encounters but here they don't overstay thier welcome and alow plenty of time for contemplation and the overarching humanity and compassion that dominates this story. So unusually for an invasion-type movie there is time and screen space devoted to long languorous sections for thought and releflection and visual allusion that reminds me of Tarkovsky's Solaris, and even Terence Malick's The Tree of Life. Basically it's classy stuff and however much the plot turns back onto positive notes the lasting impression for me was a noble sadness, a mourning that dignifies the protagonist's journey."
" Wonderful movie - no action, just thoughtprovoking. And really stunning audio
",0.659,0.975,2018-01-12 00:00:00,10,"Unlike most sci-fi, alien, movies - this one is intelligent and thought-provoking. It is more of a slow-cooked pulled pork in style, rather than popcorn popping action, yet watching it are two very well spent hours of your life.The story - at least as it appears initially - is centered around the arrival of several alien spaceships, and the need to interact and understand not only with them, but also with the other countries of the world. The question of who's to trust is of course there as an important plot point. There are however, a few other subtle, but yet key, pieces in the story that aren't obviously detectable, so anyone looking for some Marvel / Star Wars / Star Trek action should look for some other movie.In fact, the movie nods more at 2001 or Close encounter of the third kind (1977), or even the 1979's Alien, than contemporary action sci-fi movies. Yet, the tension is constant and powerful, through the careful use of photography and audio. Due to the latter, a surround-system with a good sub is required for the full effect. (Yes, it got a well-deserved Academy Award for sound editing)."

While watching I thought her daughter had died at the beginning and then the aliens arrived. We tend to interpret movies and stories in a linear fashion. I thought she was seeing her daughter in flashbacks. In one where she told her daughter 'for science ask your father,' I had an inkling that she was referring to Renner's character. It felt like the filmmaker was messing with time, just like when writer's in stories utilize flashbacks and flashforwards in fiction. I dislike when writers mess with their readers. For this reason, I could not believe and trust what the filmmaker was trying to push on me. It is not believable that she would be able to see the future."

" Not exceptional, but well-made sci-fi with a twist
",0.0,0.9666,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Arrival' is a different, semi-realistic take on the alien invasion film. It spends a little time introducing us to Louise (Adams), a translator, and then we get to see the UFO that's landed (technically hovering) in Montana. It's one of 12 - she's tasked with opening communications with the aliens. Some great shots of the ships (more like giant smooth rocks) and a good job of showing the different climate/atmosphere in and around them.It's definitely not your typical alien film - there's a lot of tension and build-up, and no big battles or gory moments. Ian (Renner), a theoretical physicist and Colonel Weber (Whitaker) are there to help Louise, but it's pretty much up to her to determine how to communicate with the aliens (or giant squids). The music can be a bit overbearing at times, and the flashbacks seem to interrupt at times, but it all comes together at the end.Didn't blow my mind, but it does delve a little deeper into how the world would realistically handle a potential threat of this magnitude. Would have loved to have seen more of the different perspectives from each site/country. An interesting enough reveal, if not totally unique (I've definitely read it in a novel or two before) and a nice message at its core."

The reason this movie sucked, is that the character development was weak. Suddenly you have Amy Adams as a soothsayer, seeing the future and then simultaneously creating that future by completing the acts she sees in the future. It's a mind-numbing game of circular logic that somehow saves the day yet the day was already saved. Look, I get it. The point of the movie is that time is a concept in our minds. The aliens experience and perceive time differently. That's the cool idea and it could've been great...unfortunately it didn't work at all in this case."

For perspective, Blade Runner(s), Alien (the first one) and Dark Star (lol) are runners-up, too, Watching Arrival the second time, I'm toying with the idea of placing it #1 on my list. It's that good, and must be high on the science fiction fan's must-see movie list. Adroit storytelling and editing, minimal but powerful visual effects, and--most important--a foundation of speculation of the role of humans as a species (and as individuals) in the universe that energizes SF."

" The deliciously dark meaning of Arrival's nonsensical plot
",0.4404,0.7541,2017-12-27 00:00:00,3,"The delicious irony of Arrival is if the alien squids came to help the humans develop so that they could help the aliens out in 3000 years then Amy Adams's Louise is doing it wrong because she KNEW the future but didn't want to change a thing about it despite gaining clairvoyance. So, I'm sorry to inform the alien squids, but y'all are mega screwed. Once I got this deliciously dark ending, I came to enjoy Arrival better than the boring slugfest this was and why I didn't flat-out give it 1/10. It's a good metaphor for how we are living today. For example, we know about climate change and how our future is heading but we don't really care about it to change our course in any meaningful way. It reminded me a little of Hugh Laurie's speech in Tomorrowland. Otherwise looking at Arrival, the actual meat of the story was delivered in the last five minutes. What a waste. Even the actual conflict between Louise and her future husband was off-screen. At the end, we're supposed to be comforted at his words about how he fell in love with her when we know they're empty words. Shortly before, she was telling him her husband leaves her and as a top-notch physicist he should have figured out she had no husband, not then and there of course as he wouldn't have known at the time, but later by putting two and two together. If he can figure out heptapod lingo, he sure as heck can figure out English. Boy, I'm not letting that fly. We don't see any of the pair's future marital woes over the loss of a child directly. THAT would have made for insightful drama. Except the drama ended just as soon as it really began. Sort of like the movie ended the way it began. It's not ""smart"", it's just hollow. The only way it could end that way is if there is an emotional payoff and I couldn't have that in the last five minutes I remotely began to feel anything during the movie. So instead we got a nonsensical plot which ended up with a 8/10 imdb rating. Next time please cut out the aliens, I mean middlemen, and skip to the real drama of the movie. You CAN cut a movie non-linearly without relying on sci-fi tropes. If Memento did it, so can you, Arrival.Anyway, it's a pity Arrival had a nonsensical plot.. I guess to fit a nonsensical world. Bravo."

This film never tried too hard (at the suspense, at the emotion, at the philosophy)...it showed and never told. And by the end I was blown away. Every element (cinematography, acting, score) worked together, and this movie somehow managed to be a sparse and character driven story that asked big questions...and happened to be about aliens. A rare feat indeed."
" Truly fascinating and awe-inspiring

I was left with my jaw literally wide open for large parts of the movie, simply because I was so engulfed in the fascinating story playing out before my eyes. Everything was original, and I found the premise and the mystery of the movie to be absolutely fascinating and awe-inspiring.
Wonderfully acted and cinematically magnificent and stunning, there are few films that live up to this film's standard. 
There is rarely a movie that I give a 10/10 to, but this movie earned it very easily. For an interesting, fascinating movie with an original plot, look no further than Arrival!"

" What was going on here?
",0.0,-0.7133,2017-12-24 00:00:00,2,"My wife and I were looking through Amazon Prime and said, hey, we didn't see that one at the theater, let's watch it now.Two hours later, my wife said, ""Well, if I'd been watching that one at the theater, I would have gotten up half way through and asked for my money back.""First off, let's look at the plot premise: In 3,000 years, humanity will help the Heptapods. But only if the Heptapods show up now to teach humanity their language, which being circular, shows that there is no such thing as actual free will, everything is predestined. That's one of the major issues with ANY time travel, as it can introduce a paradox. In this case, how is it that the Heptapods were able to be helped by humanity in the first place if they hadn't come back to change things?Second, we have the whole Slaughterhouse Five connection. My wife thought that Dr. Banks (played by Amy Adams) was reliving memories until nearly the end of the movie. I had already made the connection that she was actually becoming unstuck in time similar to Billy Pilgrim.Third, I've since then seen many reviews on here about how wonderful the music was. Seriously? The minor detail that during the scene in the Heptapod ship when Amy goes back in and a Heptapod comes 'swimming' by sounded like the theme from Jaws made both of us laugh a little.Fourth, even my wife saw the flaw in the plan of only having ONE translator and ONE scientist on the team. She made the comment early on - 'Come on, they had a whole team studying the aliens in 'Transformers'. You're going to depend upon only ONE person? That, of course, was the fatal flaw here. Supposedly Amy Adams was the only person who still had her security clearance. How about all those people that actually already WORK for the U.S. Military, doing linguistic work?Fifth (and of course, the quite ridiculous one) is that if you're going to show the military of other countries, it might help if you at least show them? Instead of simply taking US military vehicles and superimposing Chinese characters on their sides? Well, that, and let's face it - they showed the ship supposedly sitting out in the middle of nowhere in Montana. And suddenly when it came time for the armor to move in, they came screaming out of nowhere, over the hill! Seriously? You've got to figure that within a week at most, that sight would have looked like a scene from the original 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' or 'The War of the Worlds', with armor and artillery surrounding the site.Sixth - and probably about the only thing that the movie got right - was the reaction of the public as mentioned on the news. There'd be some radio wackos talking about invasion - apparently they saw 'Independence Day'. There'd be some religious people killing themselves. And there'd no doubt be some serious reactions. But at the same time ... this movie presumes that no one in the world has ever watched or read a book about an alien presence on this planet, whether it's 'Starman', CE3K, ET, or any of the OTHER movies I've mentioned previously.All in all ... can I ask Amazon for a refund of my Prime membership fee since I ended up watching this?"
" Could have been a lot better if tweaked
",0.4404,-0.6725,2017-12-18 00:00:00,5,"There were so many small problems in this film, they coalesced into one big problem: namely that the movie was not really a creative whole. Mistakes include the casting: Forest Whitaker is too old to play an army colonel. Jeremy Renner, a terrific actor, has his talents largely wasted in a vacuously written character (not much he could do about that). Lots of leaps in logic. It seemed the director wanted to get the film over with after the first half. It just didn't seem to go anywhere. Another issue is that to really understand the 'message' of the film, you need to know something about linguistics. I've studied linguistics and there is a reference made to the 'Whorf Hypothesis' often called the 'Whorf-Sapir hypothesis,' which, if you're not acquanted with it, will probably make you lose sight of the theme or not have the 'insight' about the theme. I won't mention the concept here. It's not that complicated, but if you read up on it, it should help fill in at least some of the holes in the script. In addition, and this isn't a spoiler since it is mentioned in the first 15 minutes of the film, a sizeable number of alien spacecraft land on Earth simultaneously. This trope has been done to death in horror/sci-fi films and on TV, so to make a good film with this premise is all that more difficult."

" Not what you typically expect from an alien invasion movie.
",0.0,0.9775,2017-12-16 00:00:00,8,"I had to write this because I see a lot of people getting irritated at the movie and giving it one star ratings, because they saw a big space ship on the poster and thought this would be your generic alien x human flick. It's definitely not.I'm not going to go into great detail about the entire structure of the movie, the shots were good, the sound track was very fitting, and the acting was superb. But the reason I write this is because, Arrival is the perfect example of a science fiction movie. The aliens exist not to bring lasers and incredible visual effects to the screen, but they are a vehicle by which to drive us toward greater musings. Traditional sci-fi movies used outlandish concepts to ask questions like ""What does it mean to be human?"" by exposing us to things that we have yet to experience as a species. Arrival uses the language of these aliens as a new tool to give us insight on similar concepts. Let me be real frank. This isn't a movie about aliens, it's a movie about grief, shock, and coming to terms with uncontrollable situations. It's a beautifully written narrative which illustrates that we can not narrow in on specific moments and make them define us, but see how they shape us to be part of a greater image. This is a movie for a patient, thoughtful audience and I would encourage anyone who thinks they fit that bill to watch it."

In the case of Arrival, I tried, but it was very quickly very painful. I felt that I would be putting myself through a HUGE waste of time if I watched the entire movie without skipping. So so so so glad that I DIDN'T follow through on my initial instinct to see the movie at the cinema because the Arrival trailers were so good. Again, NO WAY this movie can be rated 8/10!"

They use an oral language system that includes the use of clicks. Does this expert linguist think about using a click based language system like Kalahari to establish a form of communication? No. She runs again to English.Nearly every linguist, sociologist, and anthropologist knows that context is important for developing a basis for communication when 2 or more groups don't share the same language. You use multiple objects to establish a pattern that can be used to create a foundation that can, eventually, form a base vocabulary to facilitate oral communication. You do not start with a sentence on a white board!On top of that, the movie made the Chinese the aggressors which seems really odd when you consider that the US has the world's largest military; as of 2014, US spending on its military was literally larger than the spending of China, Russia, Saudia Arabia, France, the U.K., India, and Germany combined.Combine that fact with the US penchant for using violence - both internally and externally - to settle disputes, and you really want intelligent people to believe that the US would be the one peaceful country in the scenario?This movie was written for non-critical thinkers who want a white-girl-saves-the-world approach to SciFi."

I knew it met with mixed reviews, though a few friends, whose opinions I appreciate, said they liked it. I have to say I was blown away by the visuals, the music, the incredible tension, the nuanced performances, and finally the concept. The director weaves such a small story of two parents and their child with a much larger story of humanity's potential breakdown so seamlessly and artfully that I could barely breath toward the end. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire film. I was waiting for something to happen, but by the time I realized so much had happened, it was over.I could wonder why Amy Adams didn't win the Academy Award for her performance, why Denis Villeneuve didn't win for direction, and so on, but then no. Who care about awards? The worthy so rarely win anyway. I couldn't recommend this film more enthusiastically. Bravo!"
" An Amy Adams vehicle and she shines.
",0.0,0.9777,2017-12-01 00:00:00,6,"+ Amy Adams was magnificent in this film. She played a thoughtful, intelligent and somewhat vulnerable woman (with inner strength) in a movie that served as a vehicle for her.+ The film itself was, like Amy's performance, thoughtful and intelligent. It pulls you in and keeps you emotionally invested (mostly because of Amy Adams' performance) until the 'reveal/climax' of the film.+ The Aliens are different from most others we have encountered in films. This alone makes it a worthy sci-fi watch.The rest of the characters were not fully developed in the least:I thought Forest Whitaker - who demanded answers, who took orders from superiors who likewise demanded answers - needed to have these interactions explored.Likewise, Jeremy Renner's character deserved some airtime as the lead ""science-guy"" and his close work with Adams. He, like Whitaker, served as window dressing to Adams. There were no other characters of note in this film... In this sense, the film lacked depth as it was all focused on Adams.The ending - or rather - the reason for the Alien visit and what that visit meant to the main character was so far-fetched that I could not suspend disbelief. I say this as a huge sci-fi fan who can suspend disbelief on sci-fi B-movie stuff over 1/2 a century old. So it's a good thing I was disappointed at the very end because I enjoyed the film thoroughly up until the great reveal.Despite some of the negatives, the majority of the film was a pleasure to watch. I was starved for an emotionally rich and thoughtful character and this film filled that void. I wish that the reason for the Alien visit was different because this film would have been an 8 rating. A 9 if the other characters were developed a little more.The ending itself was atrocious. I would rate this a 6 overall on a first viewing (it's a 9 through the first part, an 8 in the middle and a 3 at the end). It's not the kind of film you look forward to watching a second time but I highly recommend a first viewing."
" Not very scientific, and cold.
",0.0,0.6749,2017-11-29 00:00:00,2,"How come such advanced alien civilization did not understand human language? Humans, the not-advanced civilization succeeded in understanding heptapod language, where a human linguist started to communicate, write and teach their language to other humans; while the heptapods, the light-years travelers and thousand-years advanced civilization, even with the help of 12 ships each of which containing at least two alien astronauts, were struggling about how to communicate with humans.So the main play is based on a keystone: Advanced species could not understand the language of the less advanced species, and a less advanced specie could understand the language of an advanced species.""Language is the foundation of civilization. It is the glue that holds a people together. It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict"" - Arrival 2016.But how come the ""foundation of civilization"" is used as a weapon? Deaf-mute people are still parts of the society, and civilization is an integration of social act basically. Thus it seems to me that there are serious mistakes in ""Arrival"" movie, it mixes the ideas of civilization, culture, language, technological achievements, and of intelligence; to reach a funny conclusion: learning an alien language can make people able to control time flow. So it misunderstands the ideas of physics as well.More annoying thing in the story, is to indicate that there is nothing wrong in knowing the exact date at which we will lose the most loved ones. That is a very terrible idea to put in a movie, a very depressing and so cold idea to conclude with."

I understand that Villeneuve is surprised by the failure of BladeRunner 2049 at the box office if the man is capable of directing this way but is that, ""The arrival"" of this film, is far above the continuation of the adaptation of the work of Philippe K.

" Think ""Solaris"" or ""Contact,"" not ""War of the Worlds"" or ""Independence Day""
",0.4847,0.8617,2017-11-26 00:00:00,8,"Smart and visually arresting science fiction tale about earth's first contact with aliens. Mysterious floating monoliths appear around the world and linguist Amy Adams, with help of physicist Jeremy Renner, work with the government to try and communicate with the aliens amid global fears and international political tensions. This story is more ""Close Encounters"" and ""Contact"" than ""Independence Day"" or ""War of the Worlds,"" where the main focus of the story is on how to communicate with the aliens, while reassuring the military brass, primarily Forrest Whittaker, that everything is okay and they don't have to attack. This tension of whether they can successfully communicate and avert a conflict with this new species (and whether other countries around the world might tip off an interstellar as well) makes for good ticking time bomb of dramatic tension, but it's really Adams who give the film an emotional human center, desperately wanting to connect with to these advances creatures, while at the same time is haunted by visions of her daughter. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who's next project was the new Blade Runner film, brings a strong visual style to the proceeding, but never in a way that is distracting to the story or style for the sake of style. My only complaint about the film is that it does move at a rather glacial pace, though in the end, the film does deliver with a terrific mind-bending of an ending, that makes the wait well worth it. Overall, ""Arrival"" is not a film for anyone wanting slam-bang science fiction, but is great if you're in the mood for something along the lines of ""Solaris"" or ""Moon."""

" Not sure why many gave this a high rating. Not worth watching.
",-0.3875,0.4438,2017-11-26 00:00:00,1,"The movie started off well enough, but I was confused by the ending and thought that the focus on the two main characters not very compelling. The guy who played the physicist did not act like a physicist. There was not much character development and the use of flashbacks was disturbing. And she was not that impressive as a linguist.I am even more confused about why so many people gave this a good review.The discovery of the aliens language was not convincing at all. It seemed ridiculous. I still do not fully understand it. The movie Contact, on the other hand, showed the viewer how the language was decoded. It was exciting and the solution unfolded. And, in the end, I sat thinking, this is it? you have got to be kidding. Also, the decision to use the linguist because she had clearance that was still in effect was ridiculous. It was as if the government had decided that one linguist would be enough. And the movie did not show interaction with the many academics that would have naturally been involved. She just did not measure up and was not convincing in her role.And there were no other real characters in the movie, just the military guy who originally contacted her and the physicist. That was it. Oh,and the daughter, but even that was just a series of flashbacks and not very compelling. The other actors were really just extras on the set to fill up the screen - more of a distraction than anything else.And I found the facilities with the plastic doors annoying and dismal. Made me feel as if the movie-makers used this vehicle to cut costs.Also, the linguist's easy access to the alien spaceship seemed to be a bit of a stretch. She could just wander out to the spacecraft on her own. Sure, that makes logical sense. In real life, she would not have been able to get access to the spaceship without going through many security checks.And the fact that she could just take off her suit and be fine was laughable. You mean the testing of the atmosphere within the spaceship did not matter? Why suddenly did it matter? And if the aliens came from 3000 years in the future, why wouldn't they set up an environment that was not lethal to humans. And it was never explained why a race of aliens so different would care about humans 3000 years in the past. It all seems even more ridiculous as I try to piece together the movie in all its parts. And I am still confused about the gift the aliens were giving to the humans. The movie did not take the time to explain what exactly the gift was and how it was to be administered.Also, the cell phone call was a stretch. I mean, to predicate the movie on a cell phone call. And it was interesting that she just happen to find a cell phone just lying around that had the type of clearance necessary to call a top-ranking Chinese general? And the guy whose phone she took would be constantly on it talking to all kinds of people. If he lost it, he would be in deep trouble. Why would he just leave it on a table? And what is the likelihood that she would be able to even find someone's cell phone lying on a table.I doubt, if in the short period of time she had to find a cell phone to make the call, she could have every found one. The only way she could have made the call is if she had the help of someone at the highest levels. Sure, just pick up a phone and call the chief of staff of the Chinese army. Gee, I could do that if I only had his number. And another thing, if these aliens were so powerful that they could influence her thinking and help he see the past and future, why would they even need her? And if they are so advanced, why wouldn't they just have been able to send a message or simply figure out a way to communicate with humans. Or simply prevent the disease or whatever was going to happen without even involving the humans (the prime directive?). I mean, if they knew about the calamity to happen to earth, they would have studied human language. If you can travel through time, communicating with an intelligent species with fully developed languages would be simple.And if you know how the race of humans communicated, why could not just duplicate that communication? The whole premise of the movie is that the humans could not communicate with the aliens. If you can travel through time, I cannot see how you could not communicated with another intelligent life-form. So much time was spent on the issue of communication. Without the resolution of the communications issue, there would not be much left of the movie. I am betting the books was much more interesting and the film-makes did not do justice to the book. It would be interesting to interview the author and read the book.And the acting was not particularly good. Amy Adams and the physicist had one mode of interaction and one mode of acting. They both just seemed numb. No laughter, no change of tone, no humor. Also, I thought that Amy Adams lost her daughter. That was also confusing. Did she later lose her daughter? Why did the daughter talk about her father leavings? Did he leave? It was never explained other than by Amy Adams saying that the father did not like what she was saying about what was going to happen in the future.Do not waste your time."

Quickly revealed is the hawk vs. dove position, as the opposing forces on Earth express their opinions in trying to decide if the aliens' intentions are hostile or peaceful.Kudos to the cinematography in the movie, but it ends there. As the movie progresses, we in the audience become lost in the flashbacks that Amy Adams' character endures, somehow trying to tie the memories she has with her daughter to the ability to see into the future, giving her the magic ability to talk to the aliens. By the end, it became too convoluted to follow, and too easy to stop caring about the fate of the main characters."

You can tell a boring movie early on, because a character's actions are always slow in coming. She thinks, she ponders, then she makes the bold move to turn on the TV. Good thing she put her huge left-wing intellect to work on that decision...making the wrong move could have been fatal.Then we have some left-wing clues early on. ""Mom, I told you not to watch that channel, those people are idiots."" First, this is made by Hollywood, so what channel do you think they are talking about? Second, she's talking to an older person, and as any Hollywood liberal can tell you, only people of the younger generation are wise enough to dispense the knowledge of the universe. It's that kind of intellectual superiority over others (OVER OTHERS) that always gives them away. Only they know what to do. The clumsy masses just aren't suited for the kind of intelligent discussions that scientists need to make...those same scientists who said we'd be under water by now.And when one of our favorite actors shows up, Forest Whitaker, as a Colonel seeking her help, she gives him a snarky comment (""you were quick to take care of those insurgents"")...letting him know right away that liberal Hollywood does not agree with the idea of not allowing insurgents to kill innocent people. Sheesh, can you be a little more subtle?The whole movie was about classism and elitism. Everyone is basically stupid except for a small handful of ivy league elites who will save the world from its own ignorance. And they're not arrogant about it, right?

",0.4767,0.9992,2017-11-20 00:00:00,10,"Rating a film 10/10 is very rare for me, but this one absolutely deserves it. It's a masterwork from Denis Villeneuve, and this is also a triumph for Amy Adams. She joins a very small list of first-rate actresses who carried the entire weight of a science fiction movie on their shoulders, along with Jodie Foster (Contact), Helen Hunt (Twister), and Sandra Bullock (Gravity). In ""Arrival"", Jeremy Renner gets co-lead billing (and is excellent as well) but it's really Adams who is the story from start to finish.It's based on ""The Story of Your Life"" by writer Ted Chiang, but Villeneuve and his writing crew made quite a few pretty substantial changes, and I think the result is actually better on screen that it was on the page. In Chiang's story, the aliens (the Heptapods) stay in orbit, and communicate with humans only by way of a sort of holograph station on the ground. And when they leave again, they just ... go. No explanation given and no closure to the story. The movie is, overall, a richer and more satisfying experience.This movie is unapologetically cerebral in the way it's built on the central concepts of language and communication. How do you start communicating with these new aliens when you have to start from ground zero with absolutely NOTHING in common (not even your planet)? Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the linguist, is the central player in the team that gets it done, and bit by fascinating bit we get to see how it happens. The process is not rushed, and (!) despite the military camp setting where the action happens, it's not violent. (There is one smallish explosion, and a bit of offstage gunfire, but that's it.) What a pleasure to watch a science fiction film that's not just a CGI slugfest. Actually, those so-called action-SF films aren't really SF at all - they're just the empty, boring calories of eye candy. ""Arrival"" is the real thing. It's an intelligent, idea-driven, gripping story that lives and breathes in an imagined world just beyond our own.One feature of the story that I liked very much was the simple but effective device that not everything was explained. Who are the heptapods, really, and where did they come from? How do they control gravity within their ships, and how do they manage interstellar travel? Most of all, why contact us? We understand by the end that they came here to teach us their language because 3000 years in the future they are going to need us, but what exactly are we going to do for them? These things are just left for us to think over. The same approach was used in Robert Zemeckis' ""Contact"" (1997), when the alien race who transmit The Message to us bring Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) through a series of wormholes to meet them. But then we learn that these aliens did NOT build the wormholes, and they don't know who did; all they can say is ""Maybe they'll come back some day."" All of a sudden, yet another vista opens up. Though the benevolent Messagers are staggeringly more advanced than humans, somewhere/when there are the Tunnel Builders who are just as far beyond them. Levels upon levels. Both of these films gain extra depth and richness by invoking vastly wider context lying beyond what we get to see.(SPOILER ALERT! From here on, don't read if you haven't yet seen the film.) On a different level, the story is about Louise herself and her personal journey. Adams' understated style perfectly fits the character of a woman who's introverted by nature but who has the quiet confidence of an accomplished expert in her field. Her eyes always reveal that she's thinking and observing. At the beginning, the impression from a fragmented series of little flashbacks is that she must have lost a child to terminal illness but has moved on from that tragedy to continue with her academic university life. Then the aliens arrive, in a dozen locations all over the Earth; they're not attacking, not actually doing anything at all, but not leaving either. She's conscripted to help with the project of how to talk to them. Physicist Ian Donnelly (Renner), as team leader, develops into a close co-worker and eventually into a fledgling romantic interest. But her flashbacks continue, getting worse and worse as she succeeds in getting deeper into the Heptapods' minds. It's a slow-burn mystery, and somewhere along the line it gradually becomes clear that she's quite literally remembering her own future, not her past. At this point, the story becomes not just a path to solving the puzzle of the aliens' logographic language, but a kind of time-travel SF. Louise is going to succeed in learning Heptapod because, in the future, she HAS succeeded, and can reach back to teach herself (with the help of the clues the Heptapods plant in her). The fact that her actions save the world from nuclear war and set humanity on a new path are just nice byproducts of the storyline. Closing the loop brings the story to a completely satisfying end.The most memorable line in the film is, without a doubt, ""Abbott is death process"", though I'm admittedly lifting it out of the context that gives it full meaning. This gently spoken little bit of dialog, translated from Heptapod, has to be among the most poignant in any movie. I'd love to see more of Ted Chiang's intelligent stories put onto the screen. One that would work particularly well should be his ""Tower of Babel"" which is just mind-bendingly clever and would look great on the screen."
" ""Arrival"" with Amy Adams reflects surprisingly believable & resonant interaction with inscrutable Extraterrestrials.
",0.296,0.985,2017-11-19 00:00:00,10,"""Arrival"" directed by Denis Villeneuve presents a most intriguing extraterrestrial first-contact scenario with Amy Adams expertly portraying a gifted linguist, teaming with Jeremy Renner as inquisitive theoretical physicist, attempting to decipher and make sense of maddeningly complex communication rings generated by interstellar traversing aliens. All the while global military forces stand amassed on highest hair-trigger alert-status with Thermonuclear counter-strike at the ready should the inscrutable extraterrestrials exhibit even the slightest sign of belligerence.**spoiler-Alert** Amy Adams appreciates the fact that her powers of translation must by unerringly-accurate and uncannily-intuitive if there is any chance of averting devastating-conflagration on a global-scope.  This uniquely-intriguing film not only showcases meticulous attempts at communication with mysteriously-perplexing (but still quite believable) complex-cosmic Life-forms, but also features heartrending dreamlike scenes of Amy Adams' brief but poignant interactions with her daughter (at different stages of life-cycle and differing ages) feeling akin to poetic vignettes and flashes of insight that always occur just as Adams' character is on the verge of some new revelation with regards to a breakthrough in communicating with the extraterrestrials.There is also astonishing narrative-progression inherent to this story revealing the cosmic travelers' true intentions along with their uncanny abilities to perceive time & space, encouraging the human viewer to deeply reflect on the fragile + tenuous nature of our own existence, ruminating on how misunderstandings in current Geo-political perspectives of human communication and breakdowns in those information-avenues among nations could easily initiate global calamity and devastation for us all.  The heightened sensitively to 'space & Time' presented in ""Arrival' could also prompt viewers to reflect on the priceless-value inherent within each precious moment of  'Life' and the importance of cherishing each & every indelible interaction, no matter how brief.  The film ""Arrival' is filled with an abundance of imagination, opening our hearts & minds to fascinating possibilities and potentials (which Amy Adams and Director Denis Villeneuve make quite believable)."

The film starts in such dreary, muted colours that I had to pause it and set the screen brightness to vivid to even see some of the opening scenes. This type of mood setting seems to be popular now but boy does it make for a depressing Friday night viewing. Along with the visual settings I found I could not follow some of the dialogue as background music often drowned the actors voices out or in some cases the actors words were unintelligible. The pace is sluggish and the discoveries made by the lead roles were not evident to the rest of the cast or to many of the viewers I suspect. It is a voyage of discovery, but one where the viewer is kept in the dark even when the discoveries are made. A little bit of stereotyping is present has the usual military ""thickos"" doing all the bad stuff, more through incompetence than malevolence; so very passé nowadays when most senior military personnel have high academic attainments. If you read ""War and Peace"" but the author had left out the ""War"" part or ""Pride and Prejudice"" similarly edited you will have some idea of how this film progresses. There is a twist at the end but its impact is lost in the ennui that I felt. I couldn't wait to get to the end and head off to bed. If I had a TV in the bedroom it would certainly have got me to sleep much earlier."

I knew the film had something to do with aliens and human contact with aliens. I didn't want to know anything else. My experience watching this movie was very different from my boyfriend's experience. He found it to be boring, I found it to be a transcendent journey through time, space, and what it means to be human. When you sit down to watch this movie, try not to have any distractions. This is one of those movies you FEEL as well as watch. The music is atmospheric, and the acting sucks you right in. You will find yourself going through a range of emotions, such as sadness, wonder, anticipation, fear, and joy. This movie isn't for everyone. This is a sci-fi movie without a lot of action/and or special effects. It focuses mostly on a beautiful and unusual story, unfolding like a novel, with each minute going by like a page being turned. This is a movie you will remember, long after the end credits roll. If you watch it and you love it, like me, you get it. If you thought it was boring... well.. you didn't. That's okay because some of the BEST movies are also the most polarizing."

" OH WOW! 138 pages and 1378 reviews. Deserves them too
",0.7027,0.9904,2017-11-14 00:00:00,9,"I find it curious that there are two distinct groups for this movie. Group one hates to waste even one star, but will write reams about how awful it is. Group two thinks it is wonderful and regrets not having enough stars to give it full credit. There is a small contingent that found it ""thoughtful"" and gave it 6 to 9 stars. I am in the last group. My better half hates nearly all Sci-fi. She tolerates George Lucas, even though he can't write dialog, but on the whole, she detests space opera, i.e., rip-offs of cowboy westerns with laser blasters and pressure suits instead of 6-guns and big hats. She finds them to be a waste of time and money – you know – 2 hours and 10 bucks gone forever. She did see this one, though I am sure she did it out of deference to me after I had insisted that she give it a chance. She liked it, not for the special effects or the ""science"" but for the characters, the acting and the plot. My dad had an album called ""Classical Music for People Who Hate Classical Music"". This is ""Science Fiction for People Who Hate Science Fiction. Of course, if you need action packed shoot'em ups, you won't like this film either. I can understand that. When I was a kid we would all get our quarters and go down to the matinée on Saturday and if a movie had too much ""just talking"" we would feel gypped. I enjoyed this one. Part of it was keeping track of what happened first. Decades ago I saw a film called ""Two For The Road"". It was the first non-linear sequence film I had ever seen which was really confusing at first, but these days it's not such a big deal. I did see one critique, which invoked ""Fermat's Principal"" by way of a criticism. I thought that was a unique approach. On the other hand, light has ways of arriving at the same point at the same relative time but at different local times. The lengths of the paths may be greater or lesser but as far as the actual photons are concerned, it all happens instantly because at the speed of light, time has a duration of zero. Is any of this relevant? As far as the story is concerned, not really. I am more interested in relativity, not the Einstein version, but the human version. The later is the myriad ways in which the millions of interconnections of neurons interact with external and internal data in concert with the personal tides of neurotransmitters that build an ever-changing model of the personal universe. This particular movie gives that (my) version of relativity an interesting and rather fun joy ride.Is the story a stretch? Well, it is Science FICTION, so – Of Course It Is ! Is there a Stargate orbiting Saturn (or Jupiter if you watched the movie)? Probably not. Is there a galaxy wide federation that has its center of government on a planet near the galactic core? Unlikely. Is there a star a few parsecs from here whose life forms live on the inner side of a gigantic rotating ring that is 200 million miles in diameter x 100 thousand miles wide with walls on either side of it 1000 miles high to keep the atmosphere from spilling out into space the whole thing of which is made out of un-obtain-e-um? Ha Ha Ha Ha ha hack cough choke cough wheeze (etc. etc. ending with wheezing and taking a few deep breaths before saying) Oh help! Ugh huh ah - - - - - - - - But you know what? I loved it, loved them all, not in spite of the ""stretch"", but because of it.Oh yes, I almost forgot. I have to give it stars. I kind of hate this part. OK, only 9 stars because I had to see it twice to follow the time shifty thing. There, that's my plot give away. Actually, I ought to give it 11 stars because the time thing means that I had an excuse to see it again right away. Hmmmm. Maybe tonight I will get up real early before the Sci-Fi hater gets up so I can see it again."
" Because nothing says ""TIME TRAVEL"" like heavy-handed politics and children dying of Space Cancer!
",-0.4926,0.9535,2017-11-14 00:00:00,3,"You should not watch Arrival, because everything you need to know about the movie is right on the cover: Amy Adams staring solemnly into the distance, while Jeremy Renner gazes longingly. Oh yeah there's aliens that apparently deserve better placement than the black guy from Battleship Earth (arguably a better alien in that movie than the Cthulhu Heptapod things were in this one.) What makes this movie terrible, and not just able to be avoided unless you need some background noise for Netflix and Chill, is that your primal lizard brain really wants to like it. The visuals are on fleek, and the score is one of those maudlin pastoral dirges that make you want to go to bed and die. Speaking of dying, Amy Adams' kid dies. That's not a spoiler because that's literally how the movie opens. Just throws it right out there on the Thanksgiving dinner table. It's gonna be a real depressing 2 hours, and don't you regret not clicking on the Avengers instead because, of course, now SHE wants to see what happens since dying children are like glue traps for millennial chicks and you're too invested at this point.As for the rest of the synopsis, there are these aliens that come to earth in twelve of those old native American grind stones that you had to smash corn with when your 6th grade class visited that pioneer village, and they speak only in coffee stains. Swear to God you're going to watch it not believing me and then go, ""Oh damn, he wasn't kidding like when he said Eleven dies in Stranger Things 2."" Evidently these coffee stains allow you to see the future ONLY IF YOU ARE AMY ADAMS despite the fact that Jeremy Renner did just as much work and actually cracked the fact that the only way to save the world was to embrace this clumsy allegory for Globalism. Where's your pay gap now, ladies?So Amy and Jeremy try to stop Forrest Whitaker from blowing up the grindstone squids despite the fact that one of the Heptapods says something in Caffeinese translates to ""Use Weapon"" and that's usually the time the aliens should have actually stepped back and thought, ""Oh hell, that was probably a really stupid thing to choose as our first words to a militarily developed native race in whose yard we happen to be parked illegally."" She eventually steals a phone and tells THE ONLY MILITARY GENERAL IN CHINA EVIDENTLY what his wife said right before she died and as they say in China, ""If you can remember what my wife told me on her death bed, then I have to call off my alien war."" So he tells future Amy Adams his personal phone number knowing that present day Amy Adams would then know it because when red headed white girls bust out fluent Mandarin, you suddenly learn everything about FTL Time Travel (which this claimed to be but absolutely wasn't).Oh yeah, also also Amy Adams keeps going back and forth in time every time she reads what the aliens are saying like she's having photosensitive time-seizures. It's not confusing however, just remember that every time you see her with her kid, that part of the movie is completely vestigial to the main story and cutting it out would actually make everyone feel better.So the aliens take Amy Adams up into their ship, and basically lay out the whole plot of the movie in subtitles because the director of this movie spent way too much time reminding everyone who watches this movie that humans are flawed, and are capable of getting sick and dying at a young age. Oh yeah, and she goes from knowing about 4 words in Coffee stain/Caffeinese/whatever to being able to carry on entire existential discussions with aliens capable of INTERPLANAR TRAVEL yet know dick about grammar and conjugation, and talk like they came from super advanced albeit somehow still REALLY into Frank Lloyd Wright squid world on a J1 Study Visa. Whole thing is just silly.Oh yeah, and instead of deciding not to have a child so as to prevent it from suffering a horrible death, and just explain it to Jeremy Renner who will believe her because she just made the aliens go away and those people probably would know stuff like that, she voice-overs this whole thing about embracing the inevitable because as soon as Jeremy Renner admits that he loves her he also leans in and Whispers Joe Biden-style, ""I want to put a baby in you"", or ""let's make a baby,"" or something super appropriate for a pre-first date phase of courtship. And then it literally ends. And you're trying to conceal the genuine fury that Hollywood had the nerve to put a SCI-FI label on a Nicholas Sparks story. What did the aliens eat? What forms of government did they have on squid world? Why did they talk in coffee circles? what was the magic intelligent ink that they used to talk made of? can you send me the PDF on how to learn that language so I can (trigger warning) Trump my friends who brag about knowing Tolkien Elvish. These are the questions that should at least be teased with the hint of an answer if you're going to qualify as a legit science fiction film. But no. All we learned about the aliens is they really like to see Amy Adams cry."
" Absolutely Dreadful!
",-0.54,-0.9266,2017-11-13 00:00:00,1,"Let's start with I'd give this movie a zero if it were possible!Since the age of around 14-15 (I'm now in my early 50's) I was totally captured by some of the greatest sci-fi movies ever such as Close Encounters of The Third Kind, Contact, Alien, Blade Runner etc, even some of the newer movies have been superb such as The Martian (Ridley truly back on form), Interstellar etc, all great movies and highly enjoyable. So what happened? This movie is sooo dull and boring that I literally could not hack it after the first hour through sheer boredom and total lack of interest. There was just nothing to grab my attention, and as much as I adore Amy Adams she was totally wasted in this dire, dull and utterly disappointing dredge!Harsh words, yes maybe, but when a movie has been hyped up so much and then when you finally get to see it and it literally bores you to tears then I cannot think of any other way of describing this pitiful experience. The less said about a bunch of starfish and squid with the capability of travel-ling light years in giant eggs the better!Truly dreadful, quite possibly the worst sci-fi movie ever!I really wish I could get my 2hrs back!"
" One of the most boring movies I've seen
",-0.3804,0.9647,2017-11-13 00:00:00,3,"So glad I rented this from Netflix instead of paying who knows what to see it in the theater. I'm really not sure what all the fuss was about. I gave it a three only because Amy Adams did a fantastic job and the cinematography was great. The movie was slow as molasses. I don't always have to see a fast paced movie, but if you are going to have one as slow as this, please tell me a compelling story. Jeremy Renner was totally wasted in this movie, he didn't do anything. Forest Whitaker was just mad all the time and the rest of the cast was basically non-existent. Amy Adams plays a linguist who is called upon to try to decipher what the aliens are saying. Forest Whitaker's character acted like deciphering a new language should be like learning to count to 10. All he did was say hurry up and we can't do that. Jeremy Renner, the scientist on the project was just window dressing as far as I could see. He didn't have any meaningful lines or input into the movie. Amy Adams carried the story and the emotion. She is the only reason I actually sat through the entire movie. In the end there is twist. They tried to make it like the twist in the Sixth Sense, but Denis Villeneuve's direction is so scattered and subtle that it falls short. My husband actually missed it and he loves these kind of movies - being a HUGE fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey."

" This Sci-fi Masterpiece Teaches Us about Time and as Well as Love
",0.886,0.9988,2017-11-12 00:00:00,10,"Having recently watched the movie Arrival for the second time (I loved it so much, once was not enough!), I was confused as to how anyone who had viewed this movie could possibly give it a rating of ""1."" After reading through a good number of the 1- rated reviews, I've concluded that these individuals, in addition to being mean- spirited, missed a very important fact about this movie. This sci-fi story, which deals with the concept of non-linear time, demonstrates how language helps to shape our view of time. The development of our language is, in large part, dependent upon the physical aspects of our bodies, which, of course, our planet's environment helps to determine (i.e., a planet with a super-strong force of gravity will foster the growth of smaller physical bodies than, say, a planet with a weaker force of gravity; a planet that is mostly liquid will foster the growth of physical bodies that have ways of ""swimming"" through that liquid, while a planet that has a lot of dry land will foster the growth of bodies that ambulate across the land with physical appendages that ""walk"" rather than swim). If you look at the human body, with its pair of eyes that are placed on the front of our heads, it makes sense that we view reality primarily through the lens of linear time. Because of the placement of our eyes, we literally see ourselves ""moving forward"" every day, and our language supports such a view. Not only do we often speak of ""moving forward"" on a project, we also refer to someone as ""backwards"" when that person does not display ""forward thinking."" But what if our bodies had been constructed differently? What if we had multiple eyes that wrapped around our heads, allowing us a 360-degree view of our environment in every waking moment? We might have designed a world view that incorporated non- linear aspects of time, and our language would most definitely have reflected such a view. If, though, in traveling to another planet, we attempted to teach our language (steeped in the concepts of non-linear time) to another species (not steeped in non- linear time), as they learned our language that might cause a shift in the perceptions of those other beings so that they were able to grasp, more easily, the concept of non-linear time. And this might, in turn, begin to change those beings' perception of ""reality,"" simply because they would be viewing reality through a different lens.Already we have humans upon our planet (some of our physicists, for instance) who are able to view time in a non-linear fashion. Einstein once wrote that ""People like us, who believe in physics, know the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" I believe it is the language of mathematics that has helped these physicists to look outside the box of our conventional perception of time. However, if one is not mathematically inclined (and I include myself in this category), watching the movie Arrival can help, I have found, to nudge one's mind into a new way of perceiving time. But, as much as I love how this film portrays the concept of non-linear time (and demonstrates how language can impact the way we view time), there is one other aspect of this film that is, in my opinion, equally important: this film is a visually beautiful portrait of a mother's love for her daughter. Loving a child often pierces the heart in a way that no other type of love does. It is as if, through the act of loving a child, a permanent imprint of the child is left upon the heart forever. It is, I have found, a gift to love a child (even when that child is not so easy to love). You learn how to put the needs of another ahead of your own, and that helps us to learn how to be a little less selfish and a little less self-centered. The portrait of a mother's love for her daughter, found within the film Arrival, is one of the most ""real"" depictions of parental love for a child that I have found in the World of Fiction. Both times I have watched this film, this portrait of a mother's love for her child has moved me to tears. In my opinion, Arrival is a perfect ""10,"" a movie that I will enjoy watching again and again. From the bottom of my heart, I sincerely thank every single individual who contributed to the production of this sci-fi masterpiece!"

Part of the following synopsis is paraphrased from ""Wikipedia"", so please do not accuse me of plagiarism. The movie opens with a ""false memory"" as linguist Louise Banks' daughter dies of cancer. But Louise is unmarried and has no child. 12 giant Zeppelin-shaped spaceships hover over 12 different locations all around the world. A team of scientists and military go inside and attempt to establish a common language to find out the 4 basic questions of who, what, where, and why they are here. She and physicist ""Ian"" lead the team. Louise (Amy Adams) has a communication breakthrough with it appears to involve a ""weapon"" as it is mistaken for the word ""tool"". These creatures are 7-legged ""Heptapods"" and resemble giant octopus. Many miraculous events occur: Louise is able to reach Chinese General Shang and an interplanetary war is averted. The aliens impart special secrets about time and space travel. It is unclear if Louise could see into the future before, but now she can. She marries Ian (Jeremy Renner) and she has her daughter ""Hannah"" knowing all along that the young girl will die in her late teens or early twenties. Many questions remain unanswered, such as: what ""favor"" will the Human Race return to rescue these beings in the far future, and is time and life more circular than linear in concept.

I watched this movie earlier in theater, and Arrival (End of 2016)and The Passengers (Beginning of 2017) both released in a close timing, came with cool spaceship CGI in trailer. I was quite impressed with those trailers. I like the Passengers better because it's more entertaining.What is the movie about?When everyone is terrified about alien visitors, a linguistics professor Louise Banks insisted and tried to become alien's friend. She solved the puzzles by learning their language. The alien's image is close to octopus, they spray black mist with tentacles, and write their language in circles, different circle represent different meaning, it's a complex language that can interpret causes and effects. Alien came to teach human their circle language because those alien saw the future from their language that they will need helps from human in someday. During the communication/learning processes with the aliens, the professor saw her future, she followed the future screens that she saw to save the Earth. She married the ""future divorced"" partner, knew their daughter would die later and she also would suffer a lot from them, yet she still followed this predicted tragedy.Why I don't like it?The movie is about fatalism, and the professor didn't do anything to change her destiny. Also, I found no reason to explain why would she fell in love with the guy, maybe a self-abuse tendency? If not, why would someone step to the hole before she already well seen it? Also her marriage has nothing to do to save earth. It's quite nonsense, I rather have a butterfly effects. What a sad literature, she walks to a heartbroken future with knowing what would happen. What a unavoidable destiny and tragedy karma.So depressed. The movie doesn't look like a science fiction movie, more likely about drama and philosophy."

Both Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are excellent actors, but not even they can bring this movie to life.It's as if the movie making ""powers that be"" threw a bunch of money on the screen hoping to hide how bad it is.I'm glad I didn't pay to see this movie!!!"

The rest of the film is flat and formulaic. You never really get a sense of who the leads are, other than some random 'passion' and sense of duty that sort of defines and binds them. It's pretty cursory.The backstory of the movie is, in my humble opinion pointless though it's threaded throughout the script. It adds a somewhat unnecessary burden to the Adams character and creates a layer in the storyline that is used to for snapshots that the writer or director could have otherwise used to better develop the main narrative. I like all the actors but it just bored me with useless artifice."

" Ambitious movie squandered by improbability and plot holes
",0.4767,0.9909,2017-10-21 00:00:00,6,"The entire movie is spoiled in this review. The movie starts with Amy Adams being a linguist professor, who's so unimportant that students doesn't even pay attention to her in the university lessons she teaches. Then, an alien invasion happens, and she's suddenly the first person the government can think of, when they need someone to decipher alien language. I don't have to explain why this doesn't make sense.Then, she meets these aliens, who look like squids. (Much have been made by the design of the space ship and the aliens, and I'm probably the only person on earth who was satisfied by their minimalist appearance. It was meant to look otherworldly, yet not enough to be a distraction to the story, and I think they did a fine job. Aliens can look like anything, so why not a giant black squid, with other little black squids for hands? The filmmakers know nothing about what an alien looks like, but neither do you) This is where to movie truly falls apart, and the reason for all of the hyperbolic one-star reviews:At the end of the movie, you know that the language of the aliens allow them to understand time as non-linear(which apparently also means that they can see the future). But for some reason - sometime in 3000 years - the aliens are going to need our help. And to assure loyalty, they give us the gift of understanding time, by forcing us to decipher their language; taking their time to ensure that the conflicts around world leaders are resolved in the process. But WHY did Amy Adams possess the ability to see the future without having learned the language at first? What made her so special? There's no explanation for any of this, and I also think it's lazy to not tell us whether we are in control of our future or not. It seems minor, but this is a sci-fi movie that clearly places emotions and character above colorful, advanced space-ships. And soooo much time is being spent on tricking you into feeling sorry for the main character, by showing what appears to be flashbacks of a child growing up and dying of cancer - only to realize at the end, that she doesn't know what's going on, either, because everything she saw was something that happened in the future. I also don't think that romance is the most beautiful thing that ever happened in the entire world, or even the most touching thing about humanity. This may be why I also wasn't impressed with the reveal that one of the guys from The Avengers turned out to be her future husband. I don't care! I want to know about the aliens!The movie could make the romance-thing interesting, but it never takes the obvious chances to do so. Best example I can think of is, that our main character knows that if she gets a child with future husband, then that child will die of cancer. But she also knows that in the future, she will keep this a secret her husband, and chooses to have the child anyway. When she eventually tells him the truth, he will leave her and the child. So many things could've been done with this. It's an interesting moral question, because even though the daughter's life was very beautiful and valuable, her husband might think otherwise. And why shouldn't he? Why should she be born, only to die before her life begun? But the movie never tells us outright what our main character will do with this knowledge, or if it condemns/applauds her for her actions.In short, it's annoying to watch a movie that has such an emotional feel to it, but never takes a stand regarding it's characters. It also doesn't always make sense. I think someone very brilliant behind this movie wanted to do too much, and lost their way."

I just cant seem to picture how someone can be bored with this movie; perhaps no lightsabers, cities destroyed or ridiculous stunts?

" This is what Sci fi is all about.
",0.0,0.9987,2017-10-19 00:00:00,10,"I can understand nay sayers, but I totally disagree.Sci Fi is a subjective and a personal thing. A rom com, is well, a film with some romance and some comedy, easy to judge on those requirements. Sci fi just isn't so easy. So those who found the film boring or full of holes, well, sorry, they just don't get what the short story, scriptwriter, director and all those involved wanted to achieve. I can understand that, but for me, Arrival was such a refreshing addition to the Sci Fi genre I was in stunned silence when the film ended in the cinema.Arrival is a thinking person's Sci fi film. Aliens arrive and for once, and for this it gets credit alone, don't want to destroy us all or steal all our water. The delivery vehicle for the soul of the film, that ultimate question of would you change your life choices if you knew the future, is simply brilliant. I have watched the film 4 times now, and do you know what? I still don't know what I would do in the lead characters situation. Tell me that isn't an appealing notion? I don't even think there is a correct answer. It's too personal a question. I can imagine changing my answer in 10 years time.If you dedicate some time to watch the blu ray extras, you can see the efforts they took with bringing the spirit of the short story to the large screen.Amy Adams is simply perfect in every way. A real character, in a sci fi movie. Impressive. The supporting cast are also excellent. All playing second string to Miss Adams, but you can see are happy to do so. Okay so Ripley was a defining female character in Sci Fi, but ultimately because she was a badass seeking revenge. The Doctor played by Amy Adams could easily have been swapped out for a male lead, this may have even appealed to a wider commercial audience, however, Miss Adams nails it and credit to the Director in his first and only choice.I could wax lyrical over the cinematography too, but I'll just suggest you watch the trailer. The cloud scene should convince you.I think a lot of people like Christopher Nolan films, and why not, he's superb. However, though his films tell a good story, do they pose an ethical question that stays with you for ages? Not that I can recall.With the recent failure of the Alien prequels. It shows that creating a universe whilst telling a good story is really difficult.I love a good shoot 'em up Sci Fi movie, don't get me wrong but Arrival raises the bar again after many blockbuster sci fi movies have been happy to sail underneath it for bigger and louder explosions.You don't need to be a sci fi buff to appreciate this movie. For the love of God, just please don't expect a spaceship shootout."

But that's not what this movie was. So many things don't make any sense about this movie. The only thing that was good about this movie was the two main characters learning how to understand the alien language. Other than that? Absolutely horrible. Most boring movie ever.

" Original and true refreshment in this genre.
",0.6249,0.997,2017-10-14 00:00:00,9,"Sharp and ShortAt first, I was afraid that we are going to see something that we've already saw, only in a different way. That was the reason why it took me a few months to convince myself to watch this movie. But when I watched it, I was pleasantly surprised. Arrival is a story which brings a new perspective of potential relation between people and creatures from outer space and that is what makes this movie unique and special. It starts when twelve mysterious spacecrafts appear around the world. Every similarity with other look alike movies ends here. Two main characters are Louise Banks, linguistics professor, and Ian Donnelly, scientist, physics specialist. They are trying to communicate with aliens in order to find out a reason for their landing. The way in which they try to do this is something we've never seen in such films. It includes mutual learning of languages. Louise and Ian tried to describe words to aliens so the aliens can show them the same words on their language. This turned out to be a very good plan. This, combined with Louise's ability to see future (which is very difficult to find out until the end), makes Arrival so special. It was a real pleasure to watch it. We were used to more or less same stories in this movie genre which almost always for the main theme have a war with aliens. Arrival brings new, original approach, which I think should be priority if similar things happen in real life. I have to leave some room for praises for cinematography. Bradford Young alongside director David Villeneuve did a great job. This is not a surprise because Sicario and Prisoners, two other very good Villeneuve's movies, also have great cinematography, when Roger Deakins did excellent job. Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker were good, although there was a room for better performances. In some critical parts, they looked slightly indifferent, but we have to have in mind that their parts weren't easy, especially Amy's. Sound editing (movie won an Oscar for this category) film editing, screenplay and lots of other things deserve special praise. All of that, brought one Oscar win and several Oscar nominations. Denis Villeneuve has one more excellent movie to add to his biography.Excellent!"

What did upset my guts was the fact that China was the country declaring war. Hilarious. The TV set up with the flag in the background, etc was just like they were taking the position of what USA has been doing for decades with other countries.

" Terrible, Borderline boring and Nonsense
",-0.7964,-0.9869,2017-10-08 00:00:00,2,"this movie was awful. it was nonsense and if just less happened it would be boring to death. though there were some good things about it. the premise was new and original, the cinematography was nice, acting was fine and *some* visuals like the alien ship were great. but the negatives outweigh the benefits. so why is this so bad? 1. nothing happens: the plot of this movie is so minimal and boring. all that happens is that aliens come to earth, Amy Adams talks to them, Chinese guy gets angry for no reason, aliens leave. and this is a 2 hour movie. as i said it's almost completely boring 2. unoriginal: this movie as i said has an amazing refreshing and original premise. there were possibilities to what directions this movie could go in. and the completely unoriginal filmmaker hacks decided to make the most boring and unoriginal thing of this. and the designs of the aliens are just as unoriginal. you could do so much with some creative designers... so the studio made sentient trees! (or squids whatever). 3. the twist: there are a number of confusing flashback sequences Amy Adams gets where she sees her dead daughter. the ,,twist'' is that it's actually her future daughter because she can see future thanks to the alien language... well that was unnecessary and dumb... 4. the characters: every character is completely dumb. even the ,,intelligent'' alien life forms are idiots. so first the army: they ask Amy Adams if she can translate some alien gibberish babble noises because she's good at languages. then they send a team of people into a ship of potentially hostile aliens just like that. the aliens are also dumb. if they can see the future and know that ,,some threat'' will threaten them and that earth will reject them why didn't they do something like defending themselves and not going to earth which they know will reject them? Amy Adams is also an idiot. after she gets flash-forwards of her daughter and knows she will die (yeah the daughter is just a bad plot device. not even like a source of character motivation or something) and she asks the alien: ,,who is that child?'' so not just is she dumb she has no common sense. also she knows her daughter will die in the future she still goes to hawkeye and basically tells him if he wants to f***. all the characters are not just dumb, they are completely bland and uninteresting. i don't even know their names. 5. it's too long: as i said before the premise is interesting but the movie is unoriginal and boring. but this movie could be much better if it at least was shorter. if this was a short film festival kind of a movie it would be a lot better. but the fact that it's 2 hours long makes it boring and unentertaining. 6. interstellar: there is a movie from i think 2014 it's called interstellar or something and well it's infinitely better than arrival. not comparing the plots but what Nolan has done with interstellar is the exact opposite of arrival. he took a very boring premise and made it interesting and entertaining while i genuinely felt emotion thanks to how good the story was. this movie took a good premise and made it boring. i felt literally no emotion even though the movie tried to force it on me with the violin music piece. ugh. Tl;Dr: arrival sucks, don't watch it"
" Teasing the brain
",-0.0772,0.9015,2017-10-07 00:00:00,8,"This is a fairly rare movie. Firstly that it is a science fiction that puts its emphasis on the first word, science, more than fiction. Of course, it's a made up story, with some decent special effects. But the interesting part is the story, and the growing understanding the character Louise gets as she tries to communicate with an alien species.First contact movies is always interesting, especially those movies that doesn't go directly to action filled war movies. It raises questions about how the aliens look, act and communicate. The last is the focal point of this movie, as the expert Lousie Banks is brought in to learn how to communicate with the mysterious aliens. Lousie makes some headway, but soon also starts to experience strange dreams and memories. Can they help her solve the problem. The dual mysteries of the alien language and Louise's dreams easily caught my attention and immediately made me think, speculate and guess my own solution. The movie made me take part in the puzzle, the mark of a really good movie. Unfortunately, someone decided that some extra drama was needed and inserted an attack of some fearful soldier, and the preparation of war by humans. Too much of a cliché for my taste, and actually unnecessary to make the story captivating enough. It seems like the writer/director didn't trust the scientific mystery to be enough. But in my opinion it took away more from the story than added to it.Still it is a refreshingly good movie, that activates the viewer instead of passivating them. It raises more questions than it answers, in a good way, both about the story, but also about our own perception of the universe.8/10"

" Mindless sci-fi movie relying on editing cheat for ""twist""
",-0.7096,-0.8481,2017-10-06 00:00:00,3,"The ""sci-fi"" part of the story is fairly irrelevant considering they don't really explore any of the ideas presented in the movie; 1) We are given ""flashbacks"" throughout the movie (but they turn out NOT to be flashbacks). ANY person who has a history of watching movies will be familiar with these edits; show a moody person with some sort of past, ""flashbacks"" of a son, of Jeremey Renner, would all lead any person to think these are scenes from the past (deceased son, failed marriage?). They aren't - but it doesn't really matter in context to the story.2) The aliens know something about the future which requires understanding of an alien language. Apparently figuring out this language allows you to see the future. Conveniently for the filmmakers, they never tried to explore the whats/whys behind her newfound ability and how her learning a language can give her such a special skill. I've learned non-linear things before - never saw the future because of it.3) There is also talk that something horrible happens in the future which requires the cooperation of earthlings to solve.

" The Arrival we've all been waiting for
",0.0,0.9925,2017-10-02 00:00:00,9,"Any film can have a story filled with drama, action, romance, and intensity, all led by its main protagonists and antagonists significant decisions. Although despite all this, the connection between that story and its audience is the factor that separates a successful film from a mediocre. Thus, the factor Denis Villeneuve's 'Arrival' most prominently possesses. It thoroughly engaged its audience through the journey of Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and her new counter partner, mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), as they attempt to communicate with the Aliens through their language in order to further understand the meaning behind their sudden arrival upon earth.Arrival expressed a sense of Drama and Mystery while raising the concern of a disaster always being in potential sight. As many would agree it's unique in its own defence compared to most, if not all Alienated sci-fi flicks, especially in the current era of its sort. Cutting off of the cliché Aliens vs Humanity straight out war, it gives us a different kind of connection to the species at hand. We are never really convinced as to which side they're really on, which gives the film a style of distinct excitement. Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer did a terrific job with this masterpiece as they truly captured the absolute attention of their audience. This was most notably through answering a question that was never asked and finishing a puzzle many would assume was solved, as they're made to realize they were actually missing a piece the whole time. This strategy is used through the connection between Louise Banks and her motherhood, which gave the film a sense of suspense and intensity it would most likely not be the same without.Films Pros:-Superb direction by Denis Villeneuve as he brings his unique artistic imagination to the screen, creating the sense of dramatic intensity and puzzlement that turned the film into the stunning visual success it became.-Spot on Cinematography from Bradford Young as the shady and gloomy image he created set the perfect tone and rhythm for the film, almost flawlessly from start to finish. In the end earning him an undeniably well-deserved Oscar nomination for his efforts.-Amazing score from Jóhann Jóhannsson. The Icelandic composer flawlessly complemented each scene that he filled with his glorious soundtrack, as it helped express the films tone upon the setting and circumstance its characters were confronting, whilst setting the current state of emotion for viewers, unquestionably touching many of them as well.-Captivating performance from Amy Adams as per usual, also strongly followed by her peers, most notably from Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker.-Stunning visual effects as the Heptapods distinctive structure along with their egg-shaped alien craft were brought to life in an exquisite fashion.-And last but not least, Eric Heisserer's adaptation of Ted Chiang's original novel 'Story of my life' was structured phenomenally. Most significantly when it transitioned from the present moment into quick flashes of memory, which was what I personally thought was a grand achievement in itself.Films Con/s:-The process of formulating the aliens language could had been visually betrayed in more of a first person manner, as at times it definitely seemed very rushed, leaving viewers in slight wonder as to whether the translation process is really that hard.From all of this, Arrival's boundless outcome was clearly obvious as it pays homage to the alien genre without even getting caught up in many clichés, proving its uniqueness. Its gloomy and exciting mystery gives fans the inside look and dramatic sci-fi experience like never before, displaying the limits that a visual sci-fi masterpiece should take in order to become successful.My personal rating: 8.7/10"
" Not quite the masterpiece I expected
",-0.5423,0.9905,2017-10-02 00:00:00,7,"I'm all for ""thinking mans sci-fi"", it's actually probably one of my favorite genres. I love Cube, Moon, 2001, Gattaca, Children of Men, Contact, Ex Machina was absolutely wonderful. There are many fine ""real"" scifi movies, but Arrival just didn't hit home for me.Looks great, acting is pretty good, soundtrack OK. The idea is kind of OK in general, but the first real problem for me was that I kept thinking (no pun intended) that why would the aliens have spoken and written language to begin with. Why assume aliens would have that much in common with us. Like they used to paint actors green to distinguish them from humans and make them alien. I kind of needed more than decoding different style of writing.Acting like said is pretty good, but like has been said in other reviews, everyone except for Amy Adams' are very thin characters. Renner shows promise, but it's a shame his character is so under developed, especially due to the ending ""twist"" of the movie. There's no revelation there, just a somewhat predictable twist, but with more in the script for Renner, it might've been better.I have to admit even I felt this movie was a bit boring at times. I kept looking at the watch and thinking now would be a good time to thrust the script, and often it did find a new twist to it, but it never really gets very interesting.I don't know, it didn't work for me at least in the first viewing. The part with social chaos, soldiers vs personal growth, how we perceive time etc didn't feel at balance. I may need to watch it again to see what the fuzz is about. I actually liked Enemy (2013) a lot more by Villeneuve, haven't seen anything else by him. Looking forward to new Bladerunner tho."
" It is not an academic essay or an important scientific research, it is just a flat sci-fi drama
",0.2023,0.9718,2017-09-30 00:00:00,4,"Arrival is a flat, stagnant and pretty uninspiring sci-fi drama with clichés throughout. If you are a science fiction fan or having an interest in alien invasion movies, it is a little possibility that you will be pleased and satisfied, because this film is not about aliens or the world society's reactions after the possibility of an alien invasion. It is more about communication, language barrier, linguistics etc. but it fails to deliver its messages and themes because of several flaws. All those posters and trailers evoke a mystery, suspense and little action, but the film's point is pretty different. We have a main character who is a go-getter type of a woman, she is talented, determined, an alpha female which is another cliché, but that's OK. Cliché casting choices? Never mind. Her character has also a sad background which is an emotional exploitation of the audience! The movie asks some important questions about life, death, future and past, our destiny and the words we speak, but it focuses on a few characters and doesn't care about the rest. The real flaw of this film is that the story becomes too personal after a while which is another famous cliché and unavoidable fate of blockbuster movies: the chosen one! I have a problem with the aliens in this movie. The envisagement of them is uninspiring. They look like giant octopuses and sometimes they feel like they are pets. I call this Transformers syndrome, because since the creators of these creatures are humans, they think like a human which causes a creativity problem in this movies such as a robot with beard and cigar or an octopus-like alien etc. The film also deals with Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, but this is not a comprehensive academic essay, a documentary or an important scientific study on linguistics, this is just a sci-fi drama, that's why I believe that it is overrated. Arrival has some statements about war and peace, unity and solidarity, but it is not effective and it drops a few plot holes into the story. The editing of the movie is smart, honestly brilliant, but no more than that. Arrival is not a thought-provoking or a very deep film, is it? These movies such as Arrival, The Fountain etc. don't reveal the secret of universe or the meaning of life. By the way, Arrival is not an action film definitely and I didn't have such an expectation. I knew that this movie wouldn't be like Independence Day, but this is not the point. The movie fails to deliver panic, chaos, suspense and paranoia well thanks to the script or low budget, I have no idea about that."

Shouldn't they be able to devise solutions to detected future problems?Why is a colonel seemingly in charge of one of the most important interactions in US & human history?Why didn't anyone berate the future-seeing advanced aliens for not preventing untold human suffering in the past?Why would a future-seeing alien allow itself to be needlessly killed?Why would Any Adams not tell Jeremy Renner about their future daughter's disease, and why wouldn't she do something to prevent or combat it?How can reading a language give someone the ability to see the future? Knowing how a bird flies doesn't allow one to fly.How could Amy Adams not know in the future that the Chinese general told her the info to secure his cooperation in the past.Why would any non-sadist help inflict this terrible movie on others by giving it a good review?"
" well worth watching
",0.4588,-0.7406,2017-09-27 00:00:00,7,"This is a well-made and well-acted science fiction movie. There is much to admire, such as a thoughtful plot, a careful construction and fine visual and special effects : the aliens, for instance, are genuinely alien, as is the environment they live in. There is also an intelligent and competent heroine, although one can question the wisdom of some of her choices.Still, ""Arrival"" tends to sidestep or neglect the moral and ethical questions it raises itself. The aliens bring a gift to humanity - but what if this gift turns out to be a curse of Biblical proportions ? What if the aliens have unleashed a terrible blight ? I, for one, would not be pleased to be on the receiving end ; moreover, I can't even begin to grasp the scale of the mayhem released on humanity if the gift became general. It's entirely possible that homo sapiens might disappear from the face of the planet in a few generations, crushed by a weight it was never meant to bear. Or else, for instance, we might find ourselves in a world in which the stupid, the callous and the evil reach a ripe old age, while the clever, the sensitive and the good commit suicide before adulthood.Ironically, there is much to be said for the argument that it would have been wise to blast the aliens to kingdom come, as soon as their ships became visible."

It certainly shines in terms of its elements of Science Fiction, the special effects, sound design and cinematography are breathtaking, truly deserving of its Academy Award nominations and win in those categories. These elements come together to create truly engrossing spectacles of cinema. However, it failed to really engage me in to its story, trying to combine so many Sci-Fi elements while also remain grounded in reality. I never became certain of what this film was trying it be or what it wanted me to feel. The character development is also poor. While Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner certainly deliver top notch performances, because of the muted vibe this movie was going for, I was never given a reason to care about them, to want them to succeed or get together. We learn very little about them, trying to intrigue its audience, I merely become uninvolved with them and stopped caring about the story all together. Tries to shock, but instead tires. Controversial opinion, you may love Arrival, as many do, but I found it to be a slow moving and tedious mess, I could not possibly recommend it. A linguistics professor must work to unlock an alien language they discover what brought them to our planet."

So a lot of people love this one, while others deem it boring, pretentious and mostly 'a waste of time'.Ironically, time is actually the main character in the movie for all intents and purposes. I wonder how many people truly watched this film with attention. Sure, you might find it boring if you are expecting an Independence day type of action flick, but that's not what it's about.In many reviews I see people talking about Louise being tormented by ""memories"" of her daughter. Do they realize that these events are not ""memories"" as Such?Imagine you were given a chance to foresee the good and the bad in your future. Feeling the torment and heartbreak of what it means to lose the purest of love. For me, the concept struck a nerve.

So what do we have? aliens so advanced that they can move in time mentally, build amazing spacecrafts without any limbs, know the human race for thousands of years and yet cannot write 1 word in English, clever aliens! the score is so pathetic, as the alien voices are created with electronic music, and for the score the composer used the same electronics, most of the time one doesn't know if music is playing or aliens talk or it's the spacecraft internal sounds. presumptuous garbage, totally worthless."
" A different sci-fi film, and a good, but divisive, one
",0.2382,0.9927,2017-09-19 00:00:00,7,"Despite being critically acclaimed, 'Arrival' is another one of those films that is praised to the heavens with critics but has wildly divided audiences judging from the nature of both the positivity and negativity. Though it has to be said that the positive reviewers have been far more mature than the negative ones, many of which to me being disgustingly condescending.'Arrival' is a very different sci-fi film, and one can definitely see why people will love it and be moved by it as well as seeing why people will hate it and be alienated. To me, 'Arrival' is not as good as reputed and is not a masterpiece, but even if it didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least. From personal opinion there are far worse films out there that are far more deserving of 1/10, and it would be insulting to put 'Arrival' down there with them. Even if the film didn't much for me, the good things would still be acknowledged and there would be real effort to be respectful of other people's opinions regardless of agreeing or disagreeing with them rather than being insulting and inventing ridiculous and untrue conspiracy theories. Those who hated it do need to grow up and start accepting that not everybody hates this film and that those who loved it are being genuine, and no being angry at being disappointed by it is not an excuse. Coming from a younger film lover than most on this site who's autistic and disabled but those have not gotten in the way of being understanding of people's opinions, what's your excuse? Back to my thoughts on the film, 'Arrival' is a meditatively paced film, and is not an action filled or jam packed with constant narrative. While this may understandably alienate viewers, neither of these are necessarily bad things especially when there are great to masterpiece films that are the same. Of the four films seen of Denis Villeneuve so far, 'Arrival' may be my least favourite, and his most polarising, least violent and most gentle, but that is just testament to how very good 'Prisoners' is and how fantastic 'Incendies' and 'Sicario' are.The criticisms are understandable and am in agreement with some. It does drag in the middle act, softening and slacking too much. It does get confusing in the later stages, where things can get ridiculous and predictable.Forest Whittaker and particularly Michael Stuhlbarg's characters are underutilised and underwritten with both having very little to do, the two do make the most of their roles one has to give them that.However, 'Arrival' does look wonderful. This is particularly true in Bradford Young's cinematography, being fluid and its tactile quality is of sheer beauty. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed and lit, the special effects have grand spectacle and the editing is some of the best of its year.Johann Johannsson's music score is another standout, it has a haunting creepiness and has a heart-pulsating and emotional beat. It not only adds a huge amount to the film, it also enhances it. Denis Villeneuve's direction is his most subtle and least hard-hitting, which is not only a good thing but the right thing, the approach he gave to 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' would have ruined an atmosphere that's the complete opposite.In terms of how it's written, 'Arrival' is not perfect but it has a movingly raw emotion, thoughtfulness, subtly suspenseful mystery and gives a compelling realism to its character especially the protagonist. Likewise the story (yes there is one), with a poignant emotion and a clever and powerful, if perhaps not the most logical, twist.The acting is one of 'Arrival's' best assets, all round it's very good even if some characters are better realised than others. Amy Adams in particular is astounding, she has rarely been more poignant. Jeremy Renner also underplays effortlessly.All in all, divisive film but count me as one of the people who liked it but in an appreciation way than a loved it way. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

I was looking for a good Sci Fi film and this one popped up.I think it fair to say that if you're looking for a Star Trek, Starship Troopers, Aliens or other classic Sci Fi film then you'll be disappointed. There is virtually no action in the film, predicated as it is on one persons attempt to communicate with a new alien race. The film could equally have been based on a linguist communicating with ghosts or people beyond the grave, it wouldn't have made a great deal of difference.Many of the other reviews talk of large plot holes, ridiculous circumstances, or complete absurdity and it's hard to argue with that.And yet. And yet in it's way, despite everything, it's a beautiful thought provoking film in the way it deals with time, life, death, emotions, human response and so much more. The film is nearly two hours long, and the pace is slow, but I wasn't bored. I didn't feel that it was dragging, and I wasn't tempted even for a second to give up or fast forward.In summary, if you're looking for a Sci Fi film then probably avoid. If you're looking for two hours of pure emotion and self inspection then without question watch this."

It almost makes HEAVEN's GATE seem not so abysmal.Amy started grating on me with all her meaningful expressions, coming off like the queen of the school play. This has become this years 'Critics Darling'; that marvel that you can't say anything negative about, or its fanboys will tell you to go watch Michael Bay.Then it descends into ""real human feelings""; sentiment, schmaltz and endless pretentious philosophizing. Go read a philosophy book to keep up with your existential angst.A story should be written so well that it will simply contain its theme, subtext, messages; etc; without having to preach down to us like we're aliens when to comes to being human. In this case 'human' stands in for over-sensitive bleeding heart dribble.A movie should never be a grueling bore, whatever it is preaching. Once again, ""messages"" mean anything that conforms to non-conformity, or Political Correctness. Was politics ever really correct? In the eyes of the politician it is.Even its 'twist ending' is lame.There is no real suspense, tension, intrigue, only the pretense.And this clown is directing the BLADE RUNNER sequel.I do have a great appreciation for intelligent movies, they don't need tons of action and overblown CGI, but this just left me not caring-the dire sign of lousy drama.Would love seeing this MSTed."

" Arrival Review.
",0.0,0.9671,2017-09-10 00:00:00,10,"What do you get with a director at the top of his game, mixed with the endless possibilities afforded to the Sci-Fi genre? The answer is Arrival. Arrival is a powerful film about the fluidity of time, and the power of language. The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve, who at the moment can do no wrong. As with all Villeneuve it goes without saying that the cinematography looks incredible. Where the film truly shines is in it's brilliant, wholly original screenplay.Amy Adams plays Louise Banks, a linguistics professor. We learn at the start of the film she is a grieving mother going through the motions, that is until 12 oval ships land across the world. Louise is tasked alongside mathematician Ian Donnelly(Jeremy Renner) to try and communicate with the visitors. Every actor is on top of their game here, especially Amy Adams, who becomes increasingly weary and desperate to communicate with the aliens, as tensions rise between global superpowers, over how to handle the situation.There is not one aspect of this film i can fault, it's one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made. It is full of wonderful ideas, and it explores them in great detail. Just like the best Sci-Fi story's it's also a human story, that is both emotional and powerful. Arrival delivers it's message without it ever feeling condescending, and it's a film that raises the bar in the the Sci-Fi genre."

As usual with films that are widely praised from critics, there are its share of audience and movie goers overreacting about how they dislike the film. Arrival is not the typical science fiction film with much action and explosions, and moments of suspense. It does feature great acting and is more of a slower paced drama. It appears people were expecting an 'alien vs humans' battle type film which this isn't. With that being said, after a while of watching the film, it did become to drag on and some parts became quite boring to watch. Those reviews saying 'there is no plot' weren't paying attention and should be avoided. Although the film does not contain much suspense or thrills. The visuals and cinematography do stand out as the film does look great. At the end we are left wondering what exactly was the point. Overall Arrival is a sci-fi alien type film where viewers apparently seem to either love it or hate it."
" A- An Alien encounter film that branches out from the standard paradigm
",0.0,-0.4596,2017-09-09 00:00:00,9,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to finish. It was refreshing to see Arrival take an alternative approach this film and focus the plot on translating and interpreting the aliens rather than the typical tropes of fighting or cohabiting with the aliens.There's nothing worse than watching Science Fiction which fails to be scientifically feasible or accurate. While Arrival leaves a lot of the science to speculation, the link between the language and time linearity is both original and believable.The acting from the cast in this film is excellent, especially from Amy Adams who does an amazing job of playing Louise.My only qualm with Arrival would be the ending. Louise called General Shang and managed to get him to call off his attack on the aliens, resulting in everyone else ceasing attack. Louise manages this by knowing about the death of General Shang's wife, something she would not otherwise know without the help of the aliens. I personally feel that the lack of persuasion required by one American woman calling up the Chinese president on his confidential number was not believable and I expected more scepticism from Shang."

" It's Tough To Stick With, But A Powerful Ending Makes The Effort Worthwhile
",0.7615,0.9981,2017-09-03 00:00:00,7,"Perhaps it's strange to review a movie starting with the end, but somehow with ""Arrival"" this makes sense. Everything, to me, led up to the question that Louise (Amy Adams) asked Ian (Jeremy Renner) as the movie approached its close - basically, ""if you could see your whole life laid out before you, would you change anything?"" That's a thought provoking question - and put in the context of this movie, it's a powerful question. As the movie started, we seemed to be offered a series of flashbacks of Louise's life. She was a mother, her baby grew into a young girl. Louise was a good mother, she adored her daughter, but something happened and her husband left her and her daughter got sick and died. What a downer of a way to start a movie. And how did it possibly relate to a story about aliens? Clearly this was not going to be a typical action-packed alien invasion/sci fi movie. But that opening was was what kept me watching. It was clear that the daughter's death had to be central to whatever was going to happen. But how? Louise was a Linguistics professor. One day, apparently after her daughter's death, 12 alien ships (""shells"") appeared in various parts of the world. Louise - the linguist - is brought in by the US government to try to figure out a way of communicating with the aliens, to figure out why they're here and where they're from. And she's teamed with Ian - a scientist. And really, until the last 10 minutes of the movie, that's about it. The movie seems to be about trying to communicate with the aliens (and to some extent about the various nations trying to communicate with each other.) I took some Linguistics classes when I was in university. I enjoyed them, but I never would have thought that linguistics would make the basis of a good or entertaining movie - and I was right. To be honest, watching Louise try to talk to the ""heptapods"" (because the aliens had seven limbs) was tedious and at times excruciating. Why are the aliens here? That was the question for all of the characters in the movie. Why am I watching this movie? That was the question for me through most of it. But the opening scenes with the daughter kept me watching. I had to figure out how those fit in with the story. And - I'll be honest - I still don't entirely understand it. Somehow the aliens' way of communicating has something to do with time. The aliens don't have a linear view of time. It isn't from the past into the future. It's everything together, all at once. And somehow this has impacted Louise. Her daughter didn't die in the past - her daughter will die in the future. And as it all comes to an end - after Louise has saved the day by convincing the Chinese (who were about to attack the shell that had landed on their territory) to back down (which maybe turned Louise into a bit too much of a hero; I think the point could have been made in a different way) she poses that question to Ian: ""if you could see your whole life laid out before you, would you change anything?""Ian's the father! Or, he's going to be the father! He asks her, ""do you want to make a baby?"" And suddenly the question is for Louise to answer: ""if you could see your whole life laid out before you, would you change anything?"" She knows that if she makes this baby with Ian, this baby is going to die as a teenager. Would you change that? Would you not have the baby? Would you not marry Ian? Because the marriage is going to fail. There are things in all our lives that we probably think on the surface we would change if we could. But that question made me think - if I changed the things that weren't so good, that would change all the things that are really great! Everything would be different, because everything is connected to everything else - like the aliens who made clear to Louise that they were just one out of twelve alien ships, all connected. Louise would marry Ian and have the baby. And, having thought about it, I don't think I'd change any of those things in my life that aren't great - because even the not great stuff is connected to the great stuff, and if I didn't have the not great stuff, I probably wouldn't have the great stuff either. If that makes any sense. Very rarely does a movie make you do something as deep as contemplating the very nature of your life. This one did.Believe me, that last 10 minutes is worth it just for that one question that it raised, and for the explanation of the movie's somewhat strange timeline. It's kind of a tough slog to get get there. It's tedious at times; it's confusing at times. There are things that are simply unbelievable. The aliens seem to have an incredibly complex way of communicating, and Louise really didn't seem to have that much time with them, so her deciphering of their language in that short time was hard to accept. But those opening scenes do keep you watching, and the closing that ties it together makes the whole exercise of watching it worth it. (7/10)"

It sure does have nice moments, but you miss a little bit of action as well as: even if you just watch it for the idea: the main question is not really treated and neither is the moral (or as I think amoral) impact that goes with it - it is not just about Amy Adams' character, there are other people involved, and if this is her decision, it is a selfish one. and talking about selfishness: Whether it was Chiang's or Villeneuves decision to, once again, bash and defame and demonize the Germans: you are the ones who should take a history book, to quote your script, since there has never been such an incident in Rwanda - just new propaganda lies to hurt and torture an entire nation. Hollywood should start paying Germany, since without the Germans to bully, the lazy, uncreative, hostile bastards would not have any story lines anymore. If you urgently need material, you should write about the crimes of US American soldiers during/towards the end of WW2, not to mention the (superfluous) bombs of the allies (France, UK, USA) on civilians at the end of the war (when pretty much everything was over) which killed millions of innocents (and destroyed historical cultural sites) in Dresden and Wuerzburg etc etc. - and which still have to be removed weekly more than 70 years after.

They should typically be dressed 1 level lower in protection to do doffing meaning level B suits. They were not. Again they confused radiation and contamination royally.

Canaries check for carbon monoxide levels not radiation levels and we have machines better equipped to do that.

As a polyglot, I love being able to see a sci-fi depicting a linguist trying to figure out an alien's language and the consequences of being able to communicate in their language.I profoundly appreciate the fact that Hollywood is able to explore the theme of alien visitation without having to rehash the heap of manure in form of ""Alien Attacks!!!"" or how an ""American Superhero saves the world from those alien overlords!!!"" that has over-saturated the monde of American films in recent decades.Amy Adams' emotional performance as the linguist (and as the only character who matters in the film, really) also helps to bridge the aliens to humans...and bridge the aliens' language to the viewers of the film.In a way, this cerebral theme of alien sci-fi is reminiscent Interstellar (except for the fact that the ""alien"" in Interstellar is of a completely different entity...I don't want to reveal spoilers here), in a way that the opening of the film provides major clues to the key of the plot.Because, as the film ""Arrival"" reveals later on, the key to life and everything else may lie closer to us than we think."
" Close Encounters of the Worst Kind

From beginning to end I was struck by the brilliance of the total lack of coherence. Whoever says this is a good movie and was moved by it is clearly lying trying to pretend to be an intelligent movie buff who realized the concept of a completely absurd and illogical film. The worst sci-fi movie of all time."

" A Sci-Fi movie at it's Best
",0.6369,0.9957,2017-08-27 00:00:00,10,"I just saw the movie ""Arrival"" with Amy Adams (2016). This is movie making at it's best. Twelve UFOs land across the globe and since they are not shooting at us we humans are trying to figure out how to say ""Hello"" and hopefully ""Whey are they here?"". Meanwhile China is not too happy with them and getting a few other countries to agree. Louise (Amy Adams) a world renowned linguist is trying to communicate with them per the one that landed in Montana before the shooting starts. This is tension combined with amazing acting, sound editing, music scoring, cinematography and directing from some of our best.Many reviews were about it getting slow in the middle. I agree as we paying money to see it like to keep the plot moving along. But it was about the frustration of talking to aliens when they arrive which was important to the setup. That was the key to making the third act so intense. Now we are talking humanity, how we on earth will respond globally and reflect upon our responses should an event like this ever actually occur. It is a something to think about movie. They did it very well without promoting a Political agenda as so many Hollywood movies do.The cast is excellent. But I've always loved Forrest Whitaker who probably has the most wide actor range in Hollywood maybe thanks to his agent and never being stereotyped given all his movies. I always feel that I'm getting my money's worth when he is on the screen. As for Amy Adams it is a love affair ever since she won my heart in ""Enchanted"" (2007) and smile when I see her in ""Charlie Wilson's War"" (2007). With ""Arrival"" beauty was not part of the script. Her costumes are low key more for exercising, her hair doesn't seem washed and bundled up to keep it out of the way. But that was the brilliance of the production to connect the audience with the emotions that she as an actress were subtle but also intensive. No one will remember much about the UFO in this movie. They will remember Amy's face. I hope she keeps entertaining us and totally stay out of Politics as so many other stars make that mistake.""Arrival"" is not an action-adventure Star Wars, the latest Star Trek reboot or anything like it. Thus many who went to the theater looking for pew-pew were no doubt disappointed. As Paramount wanted to make money I did check the trailers and they actually promoted the important scenes accurately (which is rare for Hollywood). Still if one was looking for a much improved version of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) with flashing lights they didn't get it. That movie while very entertaining on the first viewing years later is also hard to watch anymore as it is about Roy (Richard Dryfus) spending too much time in the movie building a mud sculpture in his living room. You decide."
" Needed More Meat To Chew On
",0.0,0.6352,2017-08-27 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Latest film from the director of Sicario. Thus I had hopeful expectations. The story started off with some strong, minimal and arresting imagery as once again aliens visit Earth and park themselves across the globe and sit their silently awaiting human contact. The protagonist is a linguistics expert and is tasked with attempting to communicate with the aliens to learn their intentions. Nations across the world attempt their own approaches for communication. Will all nations take a calm and peaceful approach or will some use fear as a means to attack and will humans be able to work together? What do the aliens want and are they peaceful? These are the core questions. While the film built up a great and compelling opening it began to falter for me as the process of finding these answers became repetitive and of minimal intrigue. The linguistics partner is a physicist yet never uses his knowledge to advance the story and becomes an underdeveloped sidekick. There are many vague and open-ended aspects to the film which can be fun to ponder but there wasn't enough meat or depth to mentally chew on to keep my brain processing potential possibilities. For me the film fizzled out and didn't amaze me."
" Oh-so-worthy sci-fi bore
",-0.25,-0.9589,2017-08-27 00:00:00,4,"ARRIVAL is one of those 'worthy' science fiction films that have been the rage since Spielberg made CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND back in 1977. This one's a bit like CONTACT, but nowhere near as good. Instead it feels turgid and surprisingly small-scale given the magnitude of the events depicted. An irritatingly wholesome Amy Adams plays a grieving mother tasked with communicating with aliens on their newly-arrived spaceships alongside a wasted Jeremy Renner. The aliens are ripped off from MONSTERS. Nothing much happens and there doesn't seem to be much linking between individual scenes which play out with a tired air of predictability. The worst thing about it? The non-acting, which reduces things down to a level of trivial insignificance."

Although the original writer may be Chinese, the director should have modified it. About the music, did any body noticed, the tune during the sad memories are copied from exactly from that of the sad tune of Shutter Island. Although the music directors are different they are the same. I have no idea whether they have copy right or not.

The movie is sluggish on the positive side and downright boring on the negative, yet honest, side. It is a cliché ridden movie that really doesn't get up to speed. As soon as the movie starts, it feels like you have seen it before, because the story line is so obvious. Giving it only one star would be unfair to the CGI-guys, but giving it more than three is ridiculous."

Imagine you're a housewife who's grown three kids & had job in a kindergarten and suddenly you're called on by military to talk to octopus like aliens because you had a college degree in languages and can speak 10 human languages. Then imagine a floating camera following you around as you meander around every minutiae of moving around & eventually meeting the aliens. Its all portrayed from point of view of housewife who's never contemplated such wondrous things, only looking after cute little children. And, thats the film. The sting in the tail is that the housewife part never really happened but happens now... May have worked if it wasn't so long and something else happened. Oh yes, the Chinese, of all people, known for their jumping into war at the drop of a hat, the savages they are, want to start a war with the aliens.This is the outpourings of an America that has no clue of the world, and not much about sci-fi or about mathematics, science or military.

And to ask yourself which of these feelings would come up in everyone of us and in which way we would and should react and decide. Not only in her current and future situation, but as a human race. There are only a very few movies that made me ask if there is hope.

" Plot holes you could drive a bus (or an intergalactic spaceship) through
",0.0,-0.9941,2017-08-22 00:00:00,1,"Major spoilers ahead.Bought this film on DVD while on holiday as a treat. It was not a treat. I was pretty disappointed with a cliché ridden unsatisfactory film.The film has a oft-told premise: Aliens arrive, humanity panics, what do they want? We struggle to communicate, there are misunderstandings, the aliens are not what they seem (start good, end bad or vice versa), some terrified humans attack the innocent aliens by mistake. We have seen it all before in many movies.This one however thinks it is doing something different, something unique. The production team spent most of the DVD extra documentary congratulating themselves on how original they have been. I did not see much originality at all. There were clichés throughout - scientists squabbling about their specialities, Russians killing their experts, the inscrutable Chinese , the idiot Americans, the aliens that look like an Earth animal (in this case squid).There was also a few plot holes where people act differently to all common sense or how we all know the world works. The military do not and have never made arbitrary decisions about diplomacy without someone from the government being involved (whatever country), and yet the soldiers (and not particularly high ranking ones) seem to be the ones in control of all decisions.Louise the linguist discovers non linear time. She sees her daughters death in the future. She knows when it is going to be, and why, and yet we get the scene where the doctor gives her the news - but she already knows doesn't she? Why is she upset and shocked? Time paradoxes like this can ruin films.The fact that Louise goes ahead and has her daughter knowing her fate also makes no sense. She appears to make no attempt at all to save her using gene therapy or other method, or have a different child entirely.If I was her I would have not had a relationship with Ian, the physicist at all. I suspect his genes or the combination of the two are to blame. Have a baby with someone else. Or have your own genes tested. Don't have a child at all. Having a child that is going to die a painful death before they are adult seems cruelly selfish to me. What is the purpose of foreknowledge if it makes no difference at all. Indeed, what is ""the gift"". How is it going to help humanity or the Heptapods? If the Heptapods see all of time, then how come they cannot communicate with us straight away, or in 3000 years do they never bother to learn our language? Lazy."

While most have presented aliens as the nemesis, always a threat in real time, Arrival instead goes in a different direction entirely...This movie isn't about alien threats, space battles, or any of that. Instead, it is a thesis on our own human paranoia. You don't know what the aliens want, unless you can communicate with them, soooo...Enter the linguistics expert, our prime character, who has been tasked by the government to figure out how to talk to the aliens. The movie is very slow moving, has no battles, and if it has a message at all, it is that we are our own worst enemy, as always...So the bottom line is that I did like it...but it does take a few viewings to get the message...**Update**I managed to watch it again for the fourth time, and well...I still can't say I like it as a classic SciFi example...but it is still ok as a drak movie with a not so hidden message..."
" terrible garbage, worst example of ""smart"" sci-fi that was ever made
",-0.802,-0.9882,2017-08-19 00:00:00,1,"SPOILER ALERT: THIS MOVIE SUCKS HARDER THAN BILLY EICHNER AT A MALE NAIL ARTIST CONVENTIONI rarely, if ever, write a review, but this was so terrible that it made me so nauseated and disappointed that I had to sit down and write this review to prevent my brain from self-destructing.Unfortunately, I believed the good reviews of this movie and thought that it was going to be a good, thought-provoking sci-fi movie. I really should have listened to the bad reviews, instead. For anybody that has a brain, an IQ above 100, and enjoys good sci-fi (and I'm not talking about CGI action stuff), you will be sorely disappointed. Everything about it was just so terrible... (""war"" in Farsi? Come. On. I'm not even going to begin listing all the things about that short exchange that made it so incredibly stupid, forced, unbelievable, and ludicrous. Seriously, she would let the opportunity of a lifetime walk out the door without at least telling him she would give it a shot, but that he was asking for the impossible and will come to realize it?)I'm not going to reiterate the bad reviews, most of them hit the nail on the head. I didn't read all 1300 reviews (at the time of writing this) but here's one thing I didn't see mentioned: So the Australians have already figured out that the aliens somehow lack in understanding basic algebra but somehow have a genius grasp of complex high-level equations, yet the US hasn't even been able to take the first basic steps of communication in the same time-frame? What, did the Australians not want to share any info? Seemed like they were being pretty open with everything on Skype...It would physically impossible to list all the terrible things about this movie, it would take longer than the life-span of even the oldest person that ever lived. It would also just be a complete waste of time and brain cells... I honestly have no idea how 400k voters gave this an 8. Please tell me that the Russians somehow hacked IMDb's voting system to make everybody look stupid, or that the reason it has an 8 currently is because of up- voting from people involved in making this movie, because if I start believing that the average intelligence of people is really so low that they thought this movie was that good, I'm going to try to slash my wrists with the closest object I can find.For the ""smart"" sci-fi that this was trying to be, it was worse than a failure: it probably made many people less interested in watching ""smart"" sci-fi and actually putting a few brain cells to work. If you value your brain, time, and the future of humanity, do whatever you can to never give in to believing the good reviews of this movie, and do everything you can to prevent other people from watching it. I usually give the benefit of doubt to movies that I didn't like, and re-watch it a second time to make sure that I wasn't just in the wrong mood, but it definitely was not just that I wasn't in a receptive mood or thinking properly... this movie was completely and utterly garbage. It's really an utter shame, because the premise is fantastic, but the film makers dropped the ball in every way with dialog, story line, etc. I mean, seriously, the brightest minds the US could muster were so unprepared that they didn't even think of bringing a blackboard or any visual aid?If you sat a group of first graders down for 15 minutes, they would have come up with better ideas. I dreaded every time the US military leader opened his mouth, and it was not because he was accurately portraying ""stupid military"" but just horrendous scripting, plain and simple. Actually, most garbage is probably more useful than this movie. The only use I can think of for this movie is to use it as an example of what mistakes future film makers should avoid making to turn a potentially fantastic movie into a horrifying disaster, or as a terrorist torture device. Maybe they've started spraying some kind of drugs like MDMA into the air at theaters? That's the only way I can think of that I would rate this movie higher than one star. The one star is just for the fact that it's a sci-fi movie with an interesting one-line summary, that's about the best thing I can say about it. It wasn't even possible to enjoy making fun of this movie while watching it, due to the severe nausea and suicidal thoughts that it induced.For those people that truly voted it that high, and have at least an IQ of 130, I implore you to please watch it again, but this time really pay attention to everything. Please stop texting or talking at all, because you must have only devoted 5% of your brain to watching this movie the first time. Texting and watching a movie, and then writing a review about it, should be a punishable offense. Please, I beg of you, don't get offended by what I've said, and honestly watch it again really carefully, because you've inadvertently made this world a more dreadful place."
" Seemed promising, but turned stupid
",-0.5789,0.6189,2017-08-19 00:00:00,2,"The movie tried to pull off a ""The Sixth Sense"" type of plot, though nobody's dead but the main character, Louise, can see the future. She didn't, however, see the aliens coming but fine, maybe she had to think about what she wants to see. I'll buy that.A brilliant multilingual linguist, apparently, Louise tries to communicate with the aliens without actually speaking with them. At this point I said, ""This is a stupid movie."" She then uses a white board to write, as if the aliens could read human languages, but continues not to speak with them. Finally she decides to take off her hazmat suit to speak with them but here's the thing, Amy Adams has one tone of voice throughout the whole movie, along with two facial expressions: scared and worried. That's all she's got throughout the whole movie.Then she finds out why the aliens came, which has been her job the whole movie, but instead of telling her superiors about it she just doesn't. Facepalm time. She also somehow can't manage to put her hair in a ponytail or anything, and it just blows across her face. It was really annoying. The gift, btw, is to give humans the gift of their language, which considers time differently, and is supposed to help us."

" A great movie....with some flaws!
",0.6588,0.9885,2017-08-15 00:00:00,7,"The initial impression this gave me when I was done watching was, ""wow, that was great!."" But it soon digressed to the flaws that this film has.To start with the good. This movie has AMAZING cinematography. Everything from the CGI, to the grass is beautifully directed. Every scene is well recorded and it all shows a great picture that is pure eye candy, and that's a good thing. The nature of the aliens is very mysterious and leaves you wondering about what else could have happened. I was wondering the entire time if the aliens were actually hostile, but they in turn show something a bit more beautiful. I love the message that this movie portrays, as it try's to show the audience that, in a situation like this, we would need to work together to solve a problem like this. This movie shows that, instead of waging war with each other, or better yet, aliens from a different place. Why not join together and learn more about one another.The faults with this movie are apparent, but need to be addressed. Firstly; why don't they explain MORE about the aliens origins. I understand that the movie wants the aliens to be shrouded in mystery, but I never really learn much about them other than they use some sort of plasma-like ink to communicate, as well as the deep undulating sounds that they emit. The one part that makes this movie lose a few points is the part when the lot of soldiers put a bomb inside the UFO. This was a tragic mistake by the directors. For one, the movie never explains what the UFO was made out of, and IF a bomb of that size could even trigger a small dent in the craft. Another thing I didn't quite understand was the flashbacks. How and why did they happen. The movie starts showing our main character hallucinating and even lucid dreaming. But they never explain the correlations that she had with the aliens. It was almost like she was connected with the aliens, but the movie never explains why she was chosen to be the one to do what she did.In the end, the movie was great. It does have a flaws, but conveys a great message. To all the people who give this movie a one star, they simply do not understand the hidden message that this movie has. It's not all about action everyone. Sometimes movies that are smart with what they do (in this case), will work wonders. And in the end, it IS a Si-Fi movie. Movies aren't perfect."
" A beautiful meditation on language and communication
",0.5994,0.9924,2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Hollywood is in a strange state. The movies can't be more successful, with giant film franchises like cinematic universe. Yet somehow, a lot of people are getting bored of them due to being repetitive. Thankfully, directors like Dennis Villeneuve change this course with his bold, innovative films that challenge the viewers. And arrival is one of them. Amy Adams stars as Louise Banks, a doctor in linguistics tasked with communicating with the aliens that have landed on earth. There is no explosions, no action sequences or portal in the skies to solve the issue, but instead they try to deal with interacting and understanding each other. As Louise crypts more of the aliens' language, she learns more not only from the cultural side, but finds a spiritual state in her self. The strength of the film lies in how the people react to this arrival of aliens. The social media and news of course spreads fear and paranoia across the globe, resulting in leaders, while having good intentions, take the wrong decisions. The way Villeneuve executes the communication between Dr. Louise and the aliens is mesmerizing. Its atmospheric, other worldly and exotic. And it shows through the mind and talent of an auteur who knows what is he doing. He knows how to deliver an engaging style that helps the film. His psychological emphasis on the subject matter makes a movie unique unlike any other. From a film making standpoint, this movie is a masterpiece. The direction that gives a moody feeling, and beautiful spectrum, is one of the biggest strengths of the movie. The way the conversation is shot and orchestrated is something to behold. Villeneuve created a sci film that feels operatic at its core but withing the modern age. The musical score is very beautiful and meditative. Arrival isn't just about language and communication, it's also a journey about spiritual self, and your story within the realm of your reality. A beautiful masterpiece. 10/10"
" A nice slow burn...to nowhere.
",0.4215,0.8143,2017-08-13 00:00:00,4,"We thought this sounded interesting so we streamed it via Amazon. It got off to a good start by keeping the pace slow while introducing us to the main character and what makes her tick. All good films spend time doing this, rather than jumping straight into a screenful of CGI explosions and wrecks.The intrigue built as we saw the mysterious ships and then their occupants with which our hero must communicate to see why they are here. Sadly, the story gets a bit up itself at this point, with memories of her dead child intruding (for no good reason as far I could see) and see rather too many visits to the 'interview room' on board the spacecraft as the aliens' language is (kind of) revealed. The denouement (such as it is) comes when it turns out the scientists have mistaken the word 'language' for 'weapon' (like you tend to do) and the whole global panic was for nothing. End of movie, cue a load of sentimental babble, roll the credits. Thank the Lord it cost us nothing extra. One more point - will someone PLEASE tell young American actors to stop whispering and slurring? I missed a lot of Amy Adams' dialogue because of it."

This movie is more about symbiosis and probably more a comment on global politics than most would care to admit.The movie is a slow burner, with flashbacks to a massive loss for the main character leading up to a breathtaking final 10 minutes. A lot of negative reviews are from people who don't understand what happened. Ignore these people and watch the movie. Use your imagination and listen to the dialogue. Sometimes, the biggest things that happen in movies don't have flashing lights or dramatic music to tell you it has happened!I watched this movie and sat talking to my wife about it for two hours after. It is slow, but the gift is heartbreaking and a real talking point, especially for the main character and her future."

It was a great film for anyone to watch. It might be long for some people because it was more cerebral than say District 9 which was a Sci-fi action movie.Amy Adams was great as Louise and was good for the part as a linguist trying to crack the language code and honestly communicate with the aliens. She had special gifts as well as will be seen at the end of the movie which I will not divulge.Ian was great as a person who grew to love Louise as the movie progressed. I think he not only loved her as a woman, but respected her intellect. He was a physicist (I believe), or a rocket scientist, and he gave her the biggest compliment one could give: he told her she reasoned like a mathematician. He was right if you watch the movie, her reasoning with alien communication was impeccable.Forrest Whittaker played a Colonel in charge of the operation. He is really a top notch African American actor. I've liked him ever since I saw him in the ""Last Kind of Scotland"" or something to that effect. He played Idi Amin, the brutal dictator from Uganda...and he was GOOD! He is as good as the black dude who played on The Matrix.Anyway, the lead characters played their parts very well.This movie is VERY unique because it took the avenue of trying to communicate with an alien life form versus Independence Day where survival of mankind was at stake. The music was as haunting as in the movie ""War of the Worlds"" with Tom Cruise, or maybe ""The Shining."" It gave a creepy feel to the movie! Bottom line for me: see the movie, you won't be disappointed."

Technically, their presence in US airspace and on US soil constituted an invasion; presumably China and the ten other nations around world that suddenly found themselves unconsentingly hosting alien spaceships (warships?) saw the situation in similar fashion.Jeremey Renner's character tries impressing Amy Adam's character by reading her a passage from one of her books in which she claims that language is the foundation of civilization. He compliments her both on the sentiment she expresses and on the beauty of her writing, but immediately corrects her. For him it's obvious that the foundation of civilization is science, not language. This odd flirtation between the two eggheaded academics is destined to ... well, you should see the movie if you want to know what happens next.What struck me was this: In reality, both characters are wrong. Completely and utterly wrong about origin and foundation of civilization. Science/technology and language are two separate, distinct, and complimentary means by which civilization is communicated. Neither science nor language is the 'stuff' of civilization. They provide the 'how' but not the 'what' and 'why'.To my estimation, the 'what' and 'why' constitute civilization, and it's religion (in it's broadest and most basic sense) that furnishes the 'what' and 'why' of civilization for us and, presumably, for beings like us. Religion itself, in the sense of the universal spiritual impulse that I've described elsewhere, arises in response to the need for meaning, purpose, and connection. It's all well and good to be able to communicate, to have the means for communication, but without a connection, without personal intimacy, you're not likely to share anything that is of value and meaning to you. But when both parties have a shared purpose that gives some meaning to an otherwise meaningless existence, they choose to become intimate with each other, like lovers. And from the intimacy of beings who love each other, family arises, continuing across space and through time a love that creates and protects and expands and binds together. Love becomes the 'what' and 'why' that brings together beings who once were strangers and makes of them a spiritual family, and from the love of the spiritual family religion is born. So maybe what I said about religion and civilization wasn't quite precise, since religion is also a means, a tool, by which the love that creates the spiritual family is formalized, institutionalized, made lasting, made present to the world. The foundation of our civilization (and presumably of other civilizations) is the generative love that creates life within a community, which we call the family."

It builds, very gradually, complex concepts that the average person may not find themselves thinking of on a day to day basis. This is why the climax can only hit you where it's meant to, if you paid attention and asked yourself major conceptual and theoretical questions throughout the film. You can still enjoy it as an average person, since the acting, soundtrack, and visuals/cinematography are all well above average, but it might not shake up your view of the world."
" Long... slow arrival
",0.0,0.9516,2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"Arrival was highly praised, making it one of the few movies to hit Netflix that I was actually looking forward to.The opening scene was done really well, one of those ""Up""-esc sad openings, with Amy Adams as Louise, watching her daughter grow up and then die of cancer.Now in the present (or past) day, Louise is a language teacher, and we learn that the Earth has been invaded by aliens. We learn this by a series of news shows which were mixed to have very quiet, almost inaudible sound. Not for dramatic tension but so that the filmmaker could try to startle you by suddenly having a loud blaring horn go off.The next half hour of the movie felt like it was being obnoxiously slow, as if to build atmosphere or something. They clearly did not learn from the failures of such films as the first Star Trek movie, that slow sci-fi is only superior in being more boring.The aliens begin to come into view through a haze and they suddenly cut away from it as if taking pride in being its cinematic cockteasery.The moment it cuts directly to is directly after the encounter - skipping over it, surely to beg the question ""what happened""? and leading us to suspect that we will find out why everyone looks so shocked at a more dramatic time albeit in a less suspenseful way.But instead the story just continues on. To me this took away some of the drama because all of the people acting traumatized by this experience were not behaving in a way I could relate to considering that the film is assuming that they experienced pretty much exactly what the audience did.The next scene was a bit of a head-scratcher for me too... Having not been able to begin a verbal dialogue with the aliens, Louise decides that the next logical step is to have what she calls a ""visual aid"" by showing it the written word ""Human"". To me, she as a human being would be a better ""visual aid"" than the written word. But I guess I was wrong because this prompts the alien to start creating text of its own. How stupid must all these smart people have felt when all they had to do was show the aliens an English word they had no way of understanding.Now that they have finally opened the lines of communication, this logically leads to the Colonel being angry at Louise for reasons that don't really make sense, but it allows her to go on a speech about kangaroos.The scenes that follow are somewhat interesting as they try to learn to communicate, but it gets old pretty fast; it reminded me of the Legend of Graystoke and being bored to tears with watching Tarzan learn English. I wanted to see him swinging through trees, and in Arrival - a story about an alien invasion - I wanted to see something actually happen.It becomes very clear that the author has a great interest in language and communication, and in the narration explaining the language the film is at its best. Unfortunately, the film slides into the all too predictable ""race against time"" cliché.The aliens send a message that translates to ""weapon"" which apparently the Chinese have also learned to decipher - probably written in to add to the race against time, but instead it sort of renders all of the scenes where Louise was learning the language virtually pointless since apparently several others have done the exact same thing.With about half an hour left in the movie I had figured out where the story was going. It's interesting but it probably wouldn't have been as predictable if it wasn't so DAMN SLOW PACED! Suffice it to say there is a kind of odd twist that was another interesting idea, but because of the way they did it, it feels like less of a twist than having the rug pulled out from under us, because there was clearly information that was being sneakily hid from us unnecessarily, leading to the necessary lack of character development.But then comes the worst part yet... something that I'm afraid requires some spoilers...She learns vital information by seeing into the future to a time when she already knew the information. This kind of circular story- telling is one of the laziest kinds!Now I did like the fact that the theme of non-linear time was reinforced by the structure of the film. What I don't like is that the flashes of the future come at seemingly random times and is unclear about what brings them on - nor does it explain how she was suddenly able to phone a Chinese cell phone when we were told that all global communication systems were down.I'm sorry of this is a ""spoiler"" but the way they hid the all too obvious revelation of who Hannah's father was was almost insulting.Anyway, the film is an interesting attempt but is in many ways lost potential."
" Rating: A+
",0.0,0.9989,2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"Brilliant. Is what I have to say after watching this movie twice. Nearly perfect, it has some really minor issues, but it is so freaking brilliant.Arrival is not a typical alien-invasion movie. If you're going with expectations of watching a human vs alien battle, forget it. This is a beautiful-looking suspenseful drama. Every single shot is filmed with such pitch-perfect pure beauty, Denis Villeneuve has been one of my favorites directors for the past years (Sicario, Prisoners, Enemy ... all movies from previous top10 lists of mine) and the cinematography in this one is just amazing. The first time the audience sees the spaceship up-close is a jaw-dropping long take, showing all of the surrounding space ... Gorgeous.The soundtrack also kept me so invested in the scenes, I love the tracks of when they're ""face-to-face"" with the aliens. Amy Adams has definitely an Oscar-worthy performance, she's so subtle and simple, but I believed her so much. It's one of those castings where I can't see anyone else portraying her role, she's magnificent. Jeremy Renner is good, but he's not in the movie that much. He serves more as a device for us to understand better the third act revelation and not much more than that. Opposing to Amy's role, Renner is in this movie just because of his popularity. Even his character says that he's useless at some point in the film...Now, I knew that there was going to be a twist of some sort in the third act, but it didn't make a difference ... It's really awesome. It makes me rethink the whole film and that's the main reason why I needed to watch this movie a second time before reviewing it. The truth is that it's perfectly directed, there's isn't a single flaw relatively to its story and the final revelation it's so incredible that it is going to make you leave the theater extremely satisfied. I can't tell you much more than this without spoiling something.I can't really find important issues with this movie. I mean, Jeremy Renner's character is kind of put aside pretty strangely and the whole suspense around the ""what is their purpose?"" is diluted maybe too fast, but that's not something I felt negatively affected by. The pacing might seem too slow, but if you know Villeneuve's work like I do and if you enjoy filmmaking quality like Arrival has, then everything is going to speed up a little. I actually think that the pacing improved during my second session. It's deliberately slow in order to give you time to think everything as you should, so I find this as a positive instead of a negative.Arrival is probably on my top5 list of alien-invasion of all-time. It's super intriguing, its story is fascinating, Amy Adams is so captivating with one of her best performances ever, Denis Villeneuve's direction proves to be perfect once again (one of my favorite directors of today, if not the favorite), the soundtrack is rememberable and the movie looks stunningly gorgeous, with beautiful cinematography. A deliberately slow pacing might bring the movie down for some people, but for me, it's right on point. A sci-fi masterpiece.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"

But, while Buddhism is popular in China, this film misrepresents Chinese communication, and also how members of the United States Army communicate with one another, and how our television reporters report news. The Chinese people, speaking Mandarin or Cantonese or any other dialect, didn't indicate pronunciation in writing until the Chinese government developed a system of transliteration into the Roman Alphabet in the twentieth century. But the film says that writing every human language indicates pronunciation, ignoring that every Chinese word is a one-syllable name for a picture, a picture that doesn't independently indicate pronunciation. And the film also blames China for the main failure to communicate it portrays and says, contrary to the last past decade of the history of Earth, that Russia is in cahoots with China.

" ARRIVAL: 9 / The Chess Game of Art -- My Silver Knight Rating System Explained
",0.0,0.9995,2017-08-02 00:00:00,9,"Cinema is Art--a grand creative chess game costarring Form and Story. And in keeping with the metaphor of chess, I cast these costars in the role of knights: the White Knight of Form and the Black Knight of Story. When I evaluate a movie, I evaluate the performance of each knight.But these two knights not only stand alone. On the rectangular chessboard of the silver screen, the White Knight of Form and the Black Knight of Story also partner as one unified knight, through collaborative ""conflict""--""the basis of every art,"" as Sergei Eisenstein said in Film Form (1949). Just as opposing sides of a coin, heads and tails, partner as one unified coin.In the Chess Game of Art, I dub this one unified knight The Silver Knight of Form & Story.The Silver Knight of Form & Story is the Avatar of Art, which represents an ideal-- indicated by a perfect Silver Knight Rating of 10. The Silver Knight Rating reflects my restrained judgment as to how well a movie hits this mark.And the Silver Knight Rating measures more than my intellectual perception of where a movie falls along the spectrum of artistic merit that ranges from mediocrity to mastery. The Silver Knight Rating also factors in how psychologically pleasing I find the movie, how deeply the movie impacts me emotionally . . . induces catharsis . . . inspires in me an involuntary welling up of ""aesthetic emotion""*--a term coined by Clive Bell in Art (1914) that Robert McKee redefined in Story (1997) as ""moments that blaze with a fusion of idea and emotion . . . the simultaneous encounter of thought and feeling."" The Silver Knight Rating reflects the power of a movie's presentation of Form & Story to do what McKee says life typically can't do, but art can: unite insight and emotion.My Silver Knight Rating of ARRIVAL:White Knight (Form): 9Black Knight (Story): 9=Silver Knight (Form & Story): 9I developed my concept of Form & Story and my chess-based terms White Knight of Form, Black Knight of Story, and Silver Knight of Form & Story in my work as a practicing architect and architectural theorist. I draw from a deep well of research into literary theory and painting to highlight the concept of chess as an analogy or metaphor for art--and a metaphor in which the chess piece of the knight plays the lead role dating to at least Russian Formalist Victor Shklovsky's book Knight's Move (1923). I have written extensively about this research and the meaning of my special terms--for example, in my IMDb commentary on THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI. And in my book Visual Ef9ects.But the terms Form and Story as applied to a building do not entirely parallel these terms as applied to a movie, so when it comes to movies, here's what I mean.Form = Quality of Production. The Aesthetics of Sight & Sound. Cinematography & Soundtrack, including musical score and sound design. The visible and audible (optical and acoustical) expression of artistic choices that also include set design and film architecture, lighting, wardrobe, visual effects, and editing . . . as well as the quality of acting and directing.Story = Quality of Screenplay. Shakespeare or hack? Does the screenplay present a good story well told? I base my rating on how much a movie sinks below or rises above this bar. For example, does the screenplay present a bad story well told? A ho-hum story told by an amateur? A great story beautifully told, rendered by a Story Master? And of course, Story itself represents an expression of Form, a very demanding expression of Form, requiring of the Story Architect special artistic powers and command of archetypal principles to first design an excellent story and then to craft its telling into an excellent screenplay. All of which factors into the dimension of cinema that I call Story.So for example, by way of analogy with the allied art of the stage, if Bertolt Brecht's play GALILEO benefits from an outstanding production or suffers from a poor one, then the rating for Form would go up or down. But the rating for the play itself--Story--would stay the same.For my rating of Form, I rely on a frame of reference shaped by my study of music and acting and by my work as a visual artist, principally as a practitioner and theorist of painting and architecture.For my rating of Story, I rely on a frame of reference shaped by my education as a screenwriter, which helps me size up the degree to which a screenplay reflects advanced and inspired application of universal principles of Story Design spelled out in books like The Writer's Journey, by Christopher Vogler; Memo from the Story Department, by Christopher Vogler & David McKenna; Save the Cat!, by Blake Snyder; and Story, by Robert McKee.I also factor in the degree to which Story Design measures up to what I call The Symbolic Rectangle, which I lay out in my IMDb commentary on MERU.Bottom line, by way of analogy further afield, Does the expression of Form & Story that a movie presents have more to do with the level of amateur cycling that my nifty three-speed Brooklyn Flyer and my cycling skill set represent? Or with the level of professional cycling that we associate with the quality of bikes and skill sets of the competitors in the Tour de France?Only movies that rank as worthy of the Tour de France, as it were, get highest Silver Knight Ratings.Like ARRIVAL.An expression of Form & Story summed up in one word: Exquisite.Everything about the movie radiates creative genius--complex, deep, multi-layered, intellectually profound, and visually and aurally beautiful, building through its masterful story design to a stunning convergence of insight, exhilaration, and heartbreak. I'm one of the lucky few who saw ARRIVAL before laying eyes on the poster or knowing the genre or even the logline. Thank, God, because the IMDb logline gives away more than I'd want to know before plopping down in my seat at the theater: ""A linguist is recruited by the military to communicate with alien life-forms after twelve mysterious spacecrafts land around the world."" But, blissfully, the logline keeps us light-years from the heart of the story, what the story is really about. (Which I won't spoil here.) Including, thematically, what it means to be Human. Could there be a universal language of Time, which loops us continually around the circle of Life, flashing back, flashing forward, freeing us to experience boundless synchronicities of departure and arrival--on behalf of the survival and harmony of individuals and civilizations throughout our multi-dimensional universe? Can we control our destiny when we learn the universal language of Time? And what do we do when our humanity and time converge to require of us to make choices we cannot fathom making?Just like THE INSIDER, the title of ARRIVAL has a double meaning. Two Insiders in THE INSIDER, not just Jeffrey Wigand, but also Lowell Bergman. Same with ARRIVAL. Two Arrivals in ARRIVAL--not just aliens. And like the constellation Orion in the night sky, this parallel Arrival hides in the title in plain view. If you know where to look for it, you can't miss it. And if you do miss it, the DVD special features, where Ted Chiang talks about his short story, adapted by Eric Heisserer for the screen, will give you a clue. No wonder the Academy nominated Heisserer's screenplay for Best Adapted Screenplay--it should have won.ARRIVAL presents a stunning story, two symbolic stories woven together as one, rendered by a team of remarkable artists who give this exquisite Symbolic Story exquisite Visual Form.___________________________________________*NOTE: Robert McKee gives an ironic twist to the meaning of ""aesthetic emotion."" Clive Bell coined the term to defend abstract art. Aesthetics! Bell said that aesthetic emotion rises within us from the impact of the aesthetic dimension itself. Form triggers emotion! Meaning not required. In fact, Bell maintained (again, in defense of abstract art), Form is Meaning! The only ""Meaning"" required. No need for Meaning outside of Form or beyond the Meaning of Form itself. In my book ""VISUAL EF9ECTS: Architecture and the Chess Game of Form & Story,"" I highlight the clash early in the 20th-century between this British Formalist viewpoint (Clive Bell) and the Russian Formalist viewpoint (Victor Shklovsky). Bell vs. Shklovsky. And for the past 100 years, in the education and practice of architecture, Clive Bell's viewpoint has had the upper hand: Form. Form. Form! Abstract Form, yes; Story, no. Aesthetics, yes; Symbolics, no. Chess Moves, yes; Chess Meaning, no. My theory and practice of architecture takes the less popular position: Yes, to all of it.Just like the Mother of the Arts today: Motion Pictures.Whether for the big screen or the small screen--whether feature films like ARRIVAL or open-ended narrative TV series like the 62-episode BREAKING BAD--motion pictures of surpassing quality thrill us by the magic of Visual Storytelling. The screen--cinema and TV--is the primary artistic medium of our modern world, uniquely able to spellbind us by the dynamic double-edged sword of Form & Story, possessed of emotional superpowers that bring us face to face with the truth.Long live the Silver Knight.© copyright 2017 by JEF7REY HILDNER"
" Scientifically deficient

At least the writing gives her the material to use in that way.If you are the type of person that is irritated by scientifically deficient stories then you will be disappointed by this. I don't know if the linguistics are believable but .... well actually when you get to the end you will think, what? The premise of the linguistic style really does not make sense. The premise jumps from linguistics to something else entirely.You would think that if aliens journeyed to Earth and made an appearance with so much organization and preparation then they would be prepared to assist in establishing communication. In other science fiction stories, aliens study our TV shows and learn how to communicate. You would think these aliens would do something like that and/or be better prepared to communicate. They would have equipment, such as televisions, or something that would make it more convenient to communicate; just the physical communication at least. Instead this movie makes the aliens look so incapable of so much.In real life, the countries of the world would work together better than in this movie. NASA of the United States of America has discussed the problem of communicating with aliens. There will be many experts working together to solve a problem such as in this movie if it ever exists in real life, it would not be just one person.Some movies are wound quite tightly in the sense that you can't fast-forward over much of them (I often however fast-forward over chase scenes and such) but much of this movie can be fast-forwarded over."

The only thing that remotely saves this movie from the metaphorical 'dog pile' is the acting, which to be fair is very good. With the big names involved that's no surprise. The sad truth is that the movie is so bad it's almost an insult to the actors involved. The entire story-line for this film could have been sketched out in 5 minutes on a scrap of paper, and indeed that's actually how it comes across.

Their voices were so weak they couldn't speak above a whisper, even when trying to communicate through glass partitions or during important, intense meetings. They were all absolute slaves to their clocks and could not stop maneuvers even when the experts needed a few more minutes.I heard so many people call this a sci-fi for smart people. Really? Other than a few brainy quotes thrown out in the beginning, it was a boring, romance movie with such trite statements as ""He wouldn't leave your side until he knew you were okay.""

And then I had to take in the stellar reviews here on IMDb. Wow.Where did it all go wrong? When was the collective decision made that movies are great just because they have an uplifting message? ""Arrival"" starts with an interesting premise, twelve spaceships suddenly appear all over the globe, and in the USA a linguist is dispatched to communicate with the aliens. And they always take along a canary bird for some reason. OK, that's great so far. I guess the big payoff is that the aliens look like octopi buuuuuuuuuut they have only seven legs and are caring-sharing-karma-believing hippies who want to help us out so that we will help them out in, like, three millenia. By talking in whalesong.All over the world, the greatest minds are trying to establish some sort of understanding with the spacefreaks, but then Amy Adams, or the scientist she's playing, has the wonderful idea to write down the sentence ""Hi, I'm Amy"" on a piece of paper, and the aliens are like: Wow, we traveled over hundred of lightyears, and wanted to communicate with you in writing, but we wanted YOU to initiate it. And now you did! Let me throw some circles at you! And Amy's like: Oh finally, CIRCLES! Why, that's so much easier to decode than the whalesong you did before, let me draw some scientificy-looking vectors, and there! I've solved it! And by the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis I can now look into the future! And that totally explains all the weird flashbacks throughout the movie! But most of all: OMG, the protagonist is a woman scientist!

",0.0,0.9908,2017-07-20 00:00:00,9,"Arrival is a poignant film with a rather simple and refined visual aspect, whether it is in the design of the extraterrestrials creatures (which makes by the way more credible), that of their ship (called ""shell"" in the film) or in the creation of sets.I had the pleasant impression of a film which, for once, took the time to explain as clearly as possible the phenomena and actions that were taking place on the screen. Some scenes appear like deep breaths that leave space for reflection, both for the characters and for us spectators. In a sense I was even able to immerse myself little by little in the life of the heroine until fully sharing her feelings and her ambitions. I would also like to mention the correctness with which Amy Adams embodies the protagonist, which gives even more intensity to the situation. We follow with avidity the process of interpreting the language used by of the apparent alien visitors (Xenolinguistics), and subsequently of the powers that this generates when this language is mastered (for Louise Banks the possibility to know the future)A small default that would explain the note I attributed to this film (09/10) would be the lightness of certain dialogues that created a lag in relation to the tone and general atmosphere of the film. I speak mainly of some conversations between Louise and Ian punctuated by typical phrases, straight out of a romance novel. They contrast too much with the gravity of the situation, for we are still talking about the discovery (then taken as an invasion for some) of an inhuman kind. If this film has taught me something, it is that an event like this would cause our loss, the disappearance of the human species. Indeed, we would be unable to agree between citizens and heads of state, except that this time there will not be Louise to allow us to perceive the future and thus save humanity (although we can always believe it)Arrival explores a new side of the science fiction genre, which is proving to be very interesting and deeper."
" Balancing intellect and emotion, Arrival is a truly remarkable sci-fi experience.
",0.8591,-0.9438,2017-07-18 00:00:00,9,"What would happen if an alien race visited Earth? Artists and authors have been answering this question for over a century, bringing different perspectives to the issue. While the portrayal of hostile extraterrestrials attacking the earth is certainly popular, there is a place in science fiction for stories of diplomatic visits, exploring how other civilizations may interact with ours and how humanity deals with changes on this level.When large spacecrafts land around the world, Colonel GT Weller (Forest Whitaker) brings in linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to assist in translating the aliens' words and writing. Together with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Louise works to communicate with the ""heptapod"" aliens, while at the same time, she is haunted by flashes of her daughter's life and early death. As tensions build and the threat of global war grows, Louise must find out why the aliens have come and what their visit means for humanity.I find that one of the film's strengths is its portrayal of how people around the globe react to the heptapods' arrival. We see people rioting, a radio personality calling for violence against the aliens, governments reacting through paranoia, and more. In its purest sense, Arrival is a movie about people that also features aliens. It uses their arrival as a backdrop for a story about people, in more ways than you could ever expect when walking into it.Arrival is a rare film that can balance ideas and emotions in such a way that neither overpowers the other and both can be integral to the film's character. This is without a doubt one of the finest science fiction films of the last few years, if not the past decade, and I have personally recommended it to just about anyone who will listen to me."

Time travel fixes everything.What really stuck with me from this, is the scene at the end, where the kid says ""Daddy doesn't look at me the same way anymore"", highlighting Hollywood's obsession with making fathers discardable. That wasn't Renner's character throughout the movie, but doing so made Adams more sympathetic. Disappointing."
" New-Age Aliens
",0.0,-0.9945,2017-07-16 00:00:00,6,"Linguist Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) has a baby girl, raises her through her childhood, and then suffers through the heartbreak of finding out that her daughter will die of an incurable disease at a young age.Then twelve flying saucers land in different parts of the world. People start panicking and governments begin mobilizing, which I suppose is only natural. But let's face it. If they wanted to kill us, then given their advanced technology, there wouldn't be anything we could do about it. Be that as it may, because of Banks' language skills, Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) shows up in her office to enlist her in translating the language of the aliens. Weber plays her a snippet of the aliens talking, which lasts just a few seconds, and he asks her what she makes of it, as if anyone could translate a completely alien language from such a small sample. I was hoping her reply would be, ""He said, 'Take me to your leader.'""Banks says she would have to interact with the aliens in person to be able to communicate with them. Weber refuses and says he is going to Berkeley to see if Dr. Danvers will work for them instead. Banks says, ""Before you commit to him, ask him the Sanskrit word for war and its translation."" Is this a trick question? The translation of the Sanskrit word for war has to be ""war""; otherwise, it's not the Sanskrit word for war. Presumably, she is talking about the etymology of that word, which is ""gavisti,"" rather than its translation. In that sense, I suppose you could say that the ""translation"" of the Spanish word for pregnant is ""embarrassed,"" for example. Anyway, the whole point of this is Banks' way of letting them know that Danvers is second rate. When Weber finds out that Danvers thinks the translation of ""gavisti"" is ""an argument,"" whereas Banks knows that it is actually ""a desire for more cows,"" Weber knows that he must give in to her demands to meet with the aliens. Thank goodness Weber didn't enlist Danvers for the job! With his second-rate language skills, he might have caused an intergalactic incident.On her way to the aliens in Montana, she meets Dr. Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist. He quotes from the preface of one of her books, ""Language is the foundation of civilization,"" and then tells her she is wrong, because, as he puts it, ""The cornerstone of civilization isn't language, it's science."" I guess this is the movie's way of introducing some kind of science-versus-the-humanities conflict into the story, but we cannot help but feel we are being manipulated into being on Banks' side, for it is beyond obvious that you can have language without science, but you cannot have science without language. And just in case we missed it, the point is further driven home when they arrive at the place where Banks is going to get some facetime with the aliens so she can learn how to speak Alienish. Donnelly asks if the aliens have responded to things like Fibonacci numbers. Weber has to point out to him that they are still working on the responses to the word ""Hello.""However, even Weber seems a little obtuse on this point. He later complains that the vocabulary list that Banks has constructed has words like ""eat"" and ""walk,"" which he calls grade school words. Didn't he take a foreign language course when he was in school? We all know that you have to start off with common words like ""eat"" and ""walk"" in the beginning, that you have to learn how to say things like, ""Where is the library?"" before you can start having complicated discussions about whether the aliens intend to kill us. Once again, the movie forces us to identify with Banks, because everyone else in the movie seems to be a little bit thick.Now, it seems to me that if the aliens have the technology to travel light-years across space, they have the technology to receive our television broadcasts, by which they could have learned to speak English before they ever got here. But the problem with that, according to the movie's version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, if the aliens learned to speak English it would rewire their brains, and the next thing you know, they would become rational like us. That would never do. So, Banks has to learn Alienish, which will rewire her brain so that she can grasp the mystical premise of this movie, which has something to do with the Eternal-Now and the Oneness-of-Allness. This is why, presumably, their written sentences are basically circles with curlicues. Our sentences have a beginning and an end, but the circular expressions of their thoughts defy such a linear manner of thinking. The practical consequence of this mystical premise is that the future has already happened. In fact, the aliens are helping us now to become One with each other so that three thousand years later, we will help them.Furthermore, what we saw at the beginning of the movie is actually what will happen later after she marries Donnelly, and all the flashbacks she was having about her daughter were really flashforwards. In one of those flashforwards, she tells her daughter that Daddy became angry and said she made the wrong choice, after which he divorced her. The choice in question had to do with her deciding to have a child even though she knew the child would die from a rare, incurable disease. My guess is that he said something like, ""Why the hell didn't we go to a fertility clinic and get the bad gene removed?"" But that would just be the same old, rational, scientific, linear way of thinking that comes from speaking English."

",0.0,-0.9614,2017-07-16 00:00:00,2,"First of all i have to laugh at all the so called scifi intellectuals who think this is a good scifi film and decry anyone who doesn't like it as a moronic sheep.It actually proves who the sheep are - just because a film has a totally moronic plot that defies explanation that immediately makes it profound and somehow mind expanding and that a select few Scifi fans with their heads up their bum understand - yeah right. You get the usual pontificators pointing out that it relates to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and equally long and obscure words to describe what is in essence a turgid , lifeless 2 hours of complete drivel directed by someone who produced the equally depressing Sicario!What I also cannot stand in movies and in general is when information / learning is given and is false - Kangaroo means ""large foot"" and does not mean ""I do not understand"" which is a complete myth. To make it even more hilarious this myth was debunked in the 1970s by another LINGUIST John B. Haviland in his research with the Guugu Yimithirr people. Having cinema-goers leave the cinema thinking they maybe have learnt something which is false is unforgivable emphasising once more what a con this movie is and how blinkered all of these so called intelligent Scifi buffs are!The movie moves along like a funeral procession with an awful dirge of whining violins how depressing but it illustrates the directors high opinion of what he thinks he is making.Folks this is no epic in any way - its some guy who saw a couple of octopi in an aquarium squirting ink to get rid of predators and thought hey i can make a movie out of this and so proceeded to do so.There are so many plot holes and unbelievable things in this movie like the army being involved in all the decisions - nowhere do we see the President or anyone in charge of operations , a bomb mysteriously gets planted in an alien ship that has travelled millions of miles yet doesn't detect it , the ships mysteriously disappear in a cloud of dust.The whole movie actually looked like it had been shot on a shoestring budget from the poor black eggs hanging in the sky to the cheap ships interiors and if that wasn't bad enough Jeremy Renner looked like he was bored stiff and just looking to pickup a nice paycheque!The only thing i enjoyed was reading the pontificating so called scifi fans that are so much more intelligent than us mere mortals that they thought this film was too intelligent for us to understand - no guys it is you who are too up your own bahookies to see that the director was taking the Mickey out of all of the hoighty toighty Scifi buffs who have no life and cant see the wood for the trees and trees for the wood by making a morose and clichéd retread of a zillion other better movies about the human condition and the meaning of life! The one thing all these co called scifi buffs totally missed is that this film is a blatant ripoff of the old TV Movie Epoch and they call themselves Scifi fans yeah right! There are so many people now that know the price of everything yet the value of nothing - this film wasn't worth the price of a Cinema ticket and it certainly has no value!My brother rated it as the worst scifi film he has seen in years and although I wouldn't go that far it is dreadful in just about every way and this guy is supposed to be directing the classic remake of Bladerunner - Oh dear is all I can say!"
" Thought provoking movie
",-0.2023,-0.6109,2017-07-13 00:00:00,7,"To begin, I definitely think that people with children will find this movie a bit more interesting than singles or couples with no kids. To sum up the movie, it basically asks the question, ""What if""SPOILER ALERT!!!!!The movie essentially asks the question, if you knew the future, what would you do? In this case, it was regarding the main characters decision to let her child exist. Even knowing that her child would eventually die the death she has, she still made the decision to let her be conceived/born. Her husband clearly opposes that and thus the reason she is alone and on her own as he has left because he is angry at her decision.As I mentioned earlier, the whole concept of this movie will have a more emotional impact on people with kids as it creates a discussion about what you would do as parents if you had that ability to know ahead of time what life your child would live? If you knew they would die young, would you still have the child? Or would you not have one knowing they were going to die and put you through that heartbreak? It definitely raises interesting questions about one's ideals.I definitely think the movie is slow paced at times, but overall, I liked it a lot only for the thought provoking questions it makes us think about afterwards. As a parent of kids the same age as the one in the movie, I find that I would do exactly what she did."

But what gives this film its real pizazz is the 'flashback' under-plot that starts early on and only becomes (moderately) comprehensible after various revelations and breakthroughs that emerge gradually from the main plot. Because of this, the story is quite complex and keeps the unraveling in progress all the way.Ultimately, however, the denouement is (to me) unsatisfying. No amount of arm-waving is going to convince me of the main premise, which shall remain unrevealed.A very interesting movie, but left me disappointed. Maybe I should read the story it is based on."
" A film about humanity rather than the ""Arrivals""
",0.0,0.9909,2017-07-07 00:00:00,10,"Arrival is a beautifully complex film that centers on the role of humanity in this world rather than the ""arrivals"". With this, the movie brings a new look to the sci-fi genre, as it deals with themes and emotions that many can relate to in the modern world. Arrival proves to be one-of-a-kind and one of the best in the genre, not just for pure action or the clichés we tend to see in such movies, but for its creativity and thought-provoking ideas it presents to the viewer. It is a movie that does require utmost attention, however, the experience is truly rewarding, as director, Denis Villeneuve continues his run of exceptional movies. Amy Adams, who plays a linguistic professor, leads the movie with a strong performance, yet playing a vulnerable character who succumbs to the events that unfold. The 'arrivals' themselves are wonderfully designed and their language particularly is a topic in on itself. Crafted with great cinematography and moving music, this was a deserved Oscar-nominated film, and truly one for the ages."
" A lot left unanswered

The three principal actors, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whittaker all turned in good performances. The film is not invested too heavily in special effects, but they are done well, as is the rest of the cinematography. I feel like they had to work too hard on the central conceit, and the scenes of Adams' character with her daughter dragged down the pace. A lot was left unanswered, even as she became a sort of Billy Pilgrim. I thought it was OK."
" Great ideas, thoughtful story... limp execution
",0.7717,0.9913,2017-07-06 00:00:00,6,"This is an extremely beautiful film and, like much of Villeneuve's work, focuses on ideas to do with humanity, the nature and extent of human experience, and how we can become something bigger than we are. I loved the idea of humans trying to communicate with a non-linear species that experiences time, thought, and language differently to us, but the explorations of how that really works and would impact both species felt underdeveloped, and I would have liked to see less focus on Louise's motherhood as an illustration and more on the actual mechanics of the plot. Jeremy Renner is underused as physicist Ian Donnelly, who doesn't seem to do any actual theoretical physics, and several opportunities to engage with global political, military, and governmental tensions feel glossed over, allowing the movie to become reliant on 'alien invasion sci-fi' tropes such as TV news footage of cranks and outbreaks of panic. The crux of the aliens' gift also feels like a letdown, too redolent of a million instances of ""the real treasure was knowledge all along!"", though the script does try to underscore the importance of Louise's adjusted thinking and to fully convey its effects. Great ideas and mostly very good performances from a finely tuned and sensitive cast, but Arrival feels like much more of an appetiser than a main course; an ultimately frustrating movie that promises much but delivers unevenly and with a number of plot holes and inconsistencies. They *are* very good ideas, however."
" Like watching a Pepsi Commercial about unifying every human on this Earth
",0.3612,0.9944,2017-07-05 00:00:00,7,"So there is a language - presented by the aliens - which defines not only linear definitions as we humans usually use ours, it is more complex one that includes feelings, emotions, a shred of something universal where time isn't linear, meaning that it can stimulate your whole psyche, your memories in a way that even you will have memories about things you will (most likely) only encounter with in the future. That's a sweet concept and quite logical one when it's about time being relative (the past, present, future is basically one) and humans being a species with limited cognitive function that cannot quite comprehend how universe works yet.Now the movie pretends to be an alien/science fiction movie but it figures that it's just a melodramatic story mostly based on the backlashes of idiotic human behavior - like marching aggressively against aliens without knowing what their intentions are - and fabled solutions - like changing someones determination by saying the last words of his dead wife in mandarin to make him sentimental -, which leads up to unifying every nation in our world; it's like watching a Pepsi Commercial. I mean, really, just like that everything was solved. The conclusion of the movie is that if we know the future we will cherish our present more, every moment we live through. And the key to that ""power"" to feel, see the future is to have the Universal Language presented by aliens, who somehow want to help humanity, because in 3000 years they will ask for help from humans. The whole alien part of the movie fades away and makes us the protagonists, ending up this movie being a melodrama/soap opera story with cringe worthy narrative which holds focus on Earth not on Aliens, not on the whole Universe beyond our planet. Leaving us with a quite interesting and good concept with a ""could have been told much better"" overall movie. As you see, the part isn't well articulated where the human nature comes in. See, there are people who will cherish their present differently such as with hurting others for their own safety, they get into desperate positions where they have to ""Accept"" their predestined fate, because if not, well chaos will emerge. While this movie is focusing more on how much problems we have on Earth, fu** the Universe, an other timeless piece like The Contact looks beyond our imagination and still reflects on our humanity as well with a much more satisfying motion picture, but the Arrival is a good example for how could this story be told in another way. So overall it's not a bad movie, nor perfect. It is a bit self- important storytelling with a narrative that we have already seen in other forms, versions quite several times before. The Concept is more interesting than the movie itself, which I believe is not that re-watchable as for example The Contact or Interstellar. Rating: 6.7/10"

" A film that not only tests the idea of aliens, but of humanity
",0.0,0.9905,2017-06-29 00:00:00,8,"Best science fiction film of the year against tough competition. Excellent intelligent science fiction with linguists attempting to decipher an alien language at first contact. The world seems headed for war with distrust of the aliens and each other when our hero realizes the aliens have traveled in time. Great acting and great plot. Visually the film is fantastic with an expert play on light and dark imagery, and the very deliberate use of color to emphasize certain characters and events. This transfers into the shadowy and smoke filled environment inside the alien vessel as well as the ink like Rorschach style alien writing. While trying to discover what the Aliens are, and their motivation, Dr. Louise Banks discovers what makes herself human and questions everything held sacred to her. ""Arrival"" is just as much a film about aliens landing on earth, as a film about self- discovery and the value placed on love and loss.Worth watching. Some terrific emotional performances which is rare for science fiction films. ---Yidioo"
" Rare: quality science fiction actually makes it on screen
",0.0,0.994,2017-06-25 00:00:00,10,"It is SO GREAT when real, quality science fiction actually makes it on screen. It is SUCH a rare thing. This movie is great. If you read - in particular - quality, modern short science fiction, then this movie matches the best that you can take away from that experience. I've heard science fiction described as: taking one or a few ideas in science, extrapolating them, requiring some suspension of disbelief from the reader as those ideas are explored in a novel. This actually goes beyond that, but in a very good way. The aliens are clearly so advanced as to put us in the place of ants in comparison. Their science and technologies are relative magic to us. (Something Arthur C. Clarke would appreciate.) But it's not cheesy magic: it's wonder, yet believable. Along the lines of the wonder everyone must admit to when faced with the question of: how is an unbelievably complex consciousness - which seemingly has no explanation other than a metaphysical one - how is that connected to the mundane physical flesh and gore of billions of neurons in a brain. And without spoiling anything, the talk of time and faster than light travel (or not...) turns into a conclusion here that DOES require a good helping of ""suspension of disbelief"", but: the movie earns it. Plus - the cinematography, special effects, acting, sound, music: all terrific, and all fit together into a beautiful whole. What a pleasure to watch..."

Where do they come from; why are they here and what do they want?

" Expected a not for everyone, avante-garde, thinking man's sci-fi, surprisingly got one of the dumbest scripts in recent memory
",-0.2732,0.8342,2017-06-20 00:00:00,3,"So this film does have some pluses. The acting, cinematography, pacing and editing are all pretty good. But it all gets sunk because the story makes absolutely no sense.How anyone can call this film a masterpiece is beyond me. The concept is interesting but the execution is clichéd, sappy and nonsensical. There are so many plot holes with the ending. I get that the power given to Amy Adams' character by the aliens is more or less retroactive, meaning that she had it all along because it's beyond time itself. So she's had visions of a daughter she hasn't had yet. She doesn't think this is the least bit odd? And she hasn't had visions of anything else like the aliens coming down, or Jeremy Renner being the father? That's convenient... there's a great many contrivances but the biggest problem I have with this film is that it suggests that a vision of the future can create itself out of nothing and the fact that you've seen it lets you make the exact choices needed to fulfill it. I'm talking specifically about the scene where she calls the Chinese general which is an absolute paradox. Precognition can't allow you to see futures that couldn't possibly exist. And how would precognition help humanity unite or help the aliens whatsoever? There are a great many examples in popular fiction that show that knowledge of the future can be a curse rather than a blessing. And who would get the powers? Would governments decide? Would rival countries use precognitive powers to wage war with each other? Imagine a whole world full of people who could all see the future, it would be chaos. Then there's the sappy melodrama, all the evil military guys pointing their guns at Amy Adams while she tries to save the poor aliens from being blown to smithereens, it just comes off as hugely clichéd that she's the only one doing the right thing while everyone else tries to hold her back, and by the way how did they know for sure they could even destroy the aliens? Wouldn't such an advanced race have some sort of defensive shielding? This is never mentioned. And what were they doing behind those glass walls for month anyhow? How were they sustaining themselves? And what is the lesson to be learned at the end of the film? Humans don't really learn to co-operate and communicate better. She simply uses the power to cheat humanity's way to better foreign relations. So not only is it a cheat towards ideas of precognition, it cheats the entire premise of the movie away. And then she learns that maybe changing the future isn't for the best and that she should let it happen even if she knows it will end in pain? Isn't that against the premise as well? And what does her future with her husband and kid have to do with anything anyhow except to create a needlessly emotional ending? And then there's Jeremy Renner's line at the end: ""Let's make a baby."" Seriously?? This movie is an enormously pretentious pile. Do not waste your time."

On the usual line, I am not into similar productions, but the reputation of the movie and it awards ""urged"" us in a group to pick the one in question. We all watched the movie in full, but all of us had several misunderstandings and indistinct places solved only afterwards, when reading about its plot... Vague flashbacks, strange behavior of characters in clear situations, and settlements based on Western approaches made this a topsy-turvy watch, with trivial ending and naive conclusions. And as a linguist, I know that one is unable to figure out a totally different language/pictograph in a way we see in this movie. Bringing the Western wishful thinking into the minds of non-human aliens may flatter some part of respective audience, but it is neither scientific nor logical approach... And if the basics is totally odd, then the following events do not make any good sense, particularly when bearing in mind a sci-fi movie.Therefore, for me, Arrival is above mediocrity due to the direction and leading performances only (Amy Adams as Louise Banks and Forest Whitaker as Colonel Weber, above all). The overall concept is unreasoned and necessitates to refer to its plot description later on for some of its angles and ideas."
" Sorry, but this kind of undercooked, cod philosophical stuff doesn't achieve very much at all
",-0.0387,0.9973,2017-06-11 00:00:00,6,"To be honest, Arrival probably isn't intended for the likes of me: I suspect its cod philosophical theory of time and faux-profound message of world peace is more intended for idealistic young teens and folk who like a bit of little bit of deep thinking between their soaps. Me, I prefer either no depth at all and just plenty of action, or real depth which treats me as an adult and can't be having this kind of cartoon-style theorising which is intended to impress but leaves you none the wiser (and, frankly, more than a little baffled).Having said that – and having pretty much dismissed the contents – the packaging by director Denis Villeneuve (who made 2015's far more impressive Sicario) is handsome enough and the cast do what is required of them if not much else: Amy Adams, plain enough to be convincing, adds a certain understated anguish as the super-brainy university linguist summoned by the military to help try to communicate with visiting mysterious aliens. Oh, and she was also the single mother of a young teen who succumbed to some unidentifiable affliction.Forest Whitaker is a gruff, no-nonsense colonel who collects her in the middle of the night to take her to the mysterious aliens' mysterious vessel in mysterious Montana, but then has very little else to do. Jeremy Renner charms enough as the scientific companion to Adams's linguist, but he again does pretty much nothing except spout the occasional cod science and offer support to Adams when he realised things are getting tough on her (and eventually becomes her love interest in one of the least persuasive romances I've seen on screen).Then there's Michael Stuhlbarg as – well, what exactly? His character is so peripheral, underwritten and underplayed that it's hard to know. You gather he is something of a villain, the government 'agent' in charge, because when Adams hits upon an easy- peasy way of achieving world peace, he's apparently not interested. Or something. The set- up is intriguing enough to hold your interest for a while: 12 extremely mysterious spacecraft (looking very much like smooth, but huge, brazil nuts in their shells, but I don't think we are intended to read too much into that) suddenly appear around the world, but the world is none the wiser as to why. They do not seem to threaten, but without somehow communicating with their inhabitants, the world is at a loss as to what to do next. Enter Adams, who had previously helped the US military with her knowledge of Farsi, and is tasked with getting through to the aliens to find out just why they came.She does exactly that, and although there is no apparent timescale, the rise of civil unrest around the world in view of the alien visitors and their government's inaction makes is seem like it all takes place in a matter of days or possibly weeks. But our Amy's the gal, and don't you know it, she cracks it and is communicating with the seven tentacle but otherwise super-intelligent aliens like old friends! Yes, folks, that's Hollywood for you! It's a wonder the US government doesn't simply hand over all its research to the good folk of Tinseltown because these guys and gals are really no slouches.The problem with Arrival is that it is neither fish nor fowl: the little action there is is a throwaway scene when a small group of military, fired up by right-wing TV commentators urging action, explode a bomb in the spacecraft but very little is made of that at all. In other ways it is all so sadly undercooked: the special effects and the realisation of the aliens is impressive but oddly irrelevant. The surprisingly simple – and extremely fast - deconstruction of their 'language', which also provides the key to their visit just doesn't convince. (By comparison, Jodie Foster's Contact which covers similar territory and is equally woolly still manages to persuade you of something or other.)I have already admitted that I suspect I am not the target audience for this kind of good-looking melange. You might well be, and certainly other reviews here are far more enthusiastic. But if, like me, you – well, I shan't bang on. Sadly, Arrival, for all its production values strikes me as an opportunity missed."
" Confusing

Amy Adams is a decent actress, but in this movie the script just leaves you with nails on a chalkboard. This is one movie I sat through and left thinking, ""well, that was 2+ hours of my life I'll never get back."" This is certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen, but the chances of me wanting to see it again when it comes to cable are slim and none. Amy Adams can do better honestly, and she should have taken a pass on this script."
" Less entertaining than a poorly performed root canal
",0.3832,-0.9952,2017-06-09 00:00:00,1,"First of all, I am not at all into shoot-em-up space flicks, and appreciate the cerebral kind. That is what this film came nowhere close to being. Insufferably pretentious, devoid of any really stimulating content, and paiiiiiiinfully slow paced to the point that I'm surprised I made it to the end at all. I've had root canals that were more entertaining.It's really hard to figure out who the creators thought their audience was. Sci-fi fans will be disappointed, especially male viewers. It's strictly a chick flick. But chicks who look for flicks rarely would go to see a film billed as sci-fi in the first place. Men take warning: this film is a date killer. It's depressing as hell and mating will be the last thing on your date's mind after seeing this. Your genes will die with you.I'm a research biologist and a linguist, so I know that I have to suspend disbelief when watching even the best sci-fi, and am generally able to and enjoy the film nonetheless. I wasn't able to do that with this film. The linguistics was all totally hilarious BS of the worst sort, and the scientist never did anything remotely resembling science at all.The fault is entirely in the abysmal writing, or, rather, a very feeble attempt at writing. Can't fault the actors, although the lead was a bit monotonous and grating after a while, and the child actress was horribly annoying. The whole mother-daughter story had more sap than Vermont and New Hampshire combined.It's not even worth discussing effects and such because, with such a badly written story, they were totally wasted and of no significance to the experience of the film.Unforgettable only because it was so exceptionally bad. Prometheus is a gem next to this."

But never mind they discover an entire vocabulary for the sake of communication. Characters are stupid, they can't understand the aliens so enough we show our balls let's go to war, against giant spaceships and giants aliens even if we don't have a chance and they don't threat us!

" Misleading
",-0.4019,-0.9978,2017-06-05 00:00:00,4,"It is wonderful to see a Sci-Fi movie that doesn't turn into a horror flick or war movie. The movie itself is intelligent, asks big questions, and focuses on the human experience, just like Sci-fi should. Unfortunately, none if this is entirely true.The movie does fall short in its execution and the final payoff. If you are paying attention, I think that the viewer is left feeling cheated because the promise of the movie is never achieved and the story telling tricks that are used basically present a lie to the viewer for the majority of the movie. In the end, the lie is revealed but instead of being a lie coming from an unreliable narrator like in The Sixth Sense, it is a lie generated by the writer and director to provide a sense of conflict for the main character that does not really exist. This is the lie that ruins the movie. And, the final message of the movie, what we are left with, is a horrible vision of the universe with no uplifting or redeeming qualities except, maybe, that life has value.The rest is spoiler so stop here if you have not seen the movie.The movie begins with the protagonist being shown losing her daughter to some horrible disease. The protagonist is sad. She's obviously just gong through the motions after that. The cinematography and presentation also lends to this feeling of loss and desolation that the protagonist is obviously feeling. But, that's just a trick. The protagonist has not yet had the child and the child has not died yet. The producers show you these scenes from the future and then do not give any indication whatsoever that they have now moved the timeline back to present day -- the day the aliens arrive.All through the rest of the movie, you see the protagonist trying to decipher the alien's language. You see her struggle to stay focused. You sense her deep despair over the loss of her child. They hint that the dad is a scientist and coincidentally she is working with a physicist during all of this. As a side note, Jeramy Renner's character of the physicist is pretty much useless during the entirety of the movie. He's only important to fulfill the future need for a dad for the kid that dies. You are fooled by this because of the lie setup in the first part of the movie.Once the protagonist figures out the language, she can then see the entirety of time because that's what the language teaches you. Now the writer and director reveal that she has yet to have the child with the physicist father and she chooses to have the child anyway knowing that the child will die of a horrible disease. This is beautiful in that it shows the value of life and the power that it contains. It also indicates, as does other things in the movie, that the future is set and cannot be changed. This opens the door for all kinds of conflicts and philosophical discussions about the nature of the universe. None of this is explored, of course. It's just left sitting there like a pregnant hippopotamus. Then the movie ends.The viewer is left unfulfilled. The great mystery of the aliens turns out that they want to give us the ""language"" which is earlier mistranslated as ""weapon"" which sets up a bunch of artificial conflict in the movie leading to one of the dumber scenes where a bomb is exploded on the space ship by mind-washed soldiers. But they provide this language where you can now see the totality of your existence through time. This means that it's pointless to live your life because you now know everything already. And, you know you cannot change anything at all. You will know that you are being a jerk to somebody who is going to die in the next hour, but you are still a jerk to them and you can do nothing to change it all. It is the ultimate expression of nihilism. Nothing you do matters. It's all set in stone even though you now may know better, you are doomed to live your mistakes all the way through. It would be like being trapped in a nightmare.The language was not a gift. It was torture. It would destroy humanity. So, in the end, it turns out that this was yet another horror flick disguised as sci-fi. The gift of the language really was a weapon. It wold destroy humanity by destroying the wonder of living your life."
" if you knew how your life would play out, would you change anything?

Any path is worthy of consideration, even a nihilistic path.What is not examined is how good a chess player you'd have to be in order to utilize this gift. How any one person's solution might deprive another of their liberties. This last question is true even today.the ""Gift"" is imparted even now, since we have the same abilities to decide our own actions 5 minutes hence, just not 3000 years hence.If you are not open to considering the larger questions offered by the movie, then it might appear to you as a drawn out affair with little to offer."
" Double U. Tee. Eff?
",0.0,-0.4383,2017-06-02 00:00:00,4,"This is one of the most baffling movies ever. Not because of the ""surprising"" twist, which is only surprising because it is completely moronic, but because it was so well received. Seriously, people, have we seen the same movie? Because 'Arrival' surely isn't a masterpiece. It is not a good movie, it is not even a mediocre movie. It is just bad. If I were to rate it solely on the basis of the pleasure I managed to extract from it, I would probably give it a rating below zero - which, sadly, I can't do on IMDb, but I would be very happy if I could. Of course, there are some good things about 'Arrival', which is why I am being so generous with the rating, but these good things only make the bad things stand out. OK, Amy Adams is one of the greatest film actresses ever. That is a fact, and here she is doing as well as the (idiotic) script allows her to. Jeremy Renner is also a great actor, and he just oozes charisma. The acting as a whole is pretty good. The cinematography is acceptable, I think. It is not spectacular, and it is definitely not Oscar worthy, but it is competently done, which is more than what I can say about the script. Before I rip the script to shreds, though, I just want to say that this movie does not deserve a single nomination for any award. It is not even interesting enough for a Razzie. And, I am sorry, but... An Oscar for sound editing? Against 'La La Land'? Seriously? What is next, praising Kevin Hart for being taller than Yao Ming? An Oscar nomination for production design? What for? I am sorry, but this movie literally does not have production design. What design? This space ship that looks like a giant bean? Or the dark rooms that look like dark rooms? Because there is literally - literally - nothing else. Literally. Did I say literally? From afar the space ship looks, as I said, like a giant bean. Shown from the inside, it looks like a dark room, and there are some boxes and one big rectangular window. That is it. That is the entire production design. Hell, reading about it here probably makes it look more inventive than it is.As for the script... Well, it is exactly as good as it is expected from the writer behind the remake of 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. Seriously, Eric Heisserer's entire career consists of brainless horror/thriller movies and nothing else. Two remakes of beloved horror classics, one mediocre thriller that he also directed, one sequel that nobody wanted, and, well, 'Van Helsing', which will probably be the most enjoyable thing he has ever worked on, being a stupid high budget action movie. Oh, yes, I am forgetting 'Extinction' and the TV episode he did eleven years ago. Apart from 'Arrival', that is his entire career. Nobody expects from such a writer to write a masterpiece, and, unsurprisingly, he didn't write a masterpiece. Why was his work on 'Arrival' nominated for an Oscar then? Literally anyone can point out its flaws - be it the stupidity of the military men, making the military men in 'Transformers' look like Harvard professors in comparison, the fact that Jeremy Renner's character is not even a character, he is just there for the romance, the fact that the President of the USA never addresses the alien civilization visiting his country, the fact that not a single biologist appears on screen, the fact that the twist at the end is not only stupid, but it also limits the actors' performances in the most horrible way possible, the fact that the main character makes morally ambiguous decisions that may and probably will ruin the life of everyone she cares about for good and this is presented as something good... Notice that I am not actually spoiling the movie. If I were to do that, the review would be much longer.Anyway, this movie is a complete failure, partially saved by the acting and the cinematography. But the cinematography is not that good and the acting is severely limited by the idiotic script. Sorry."

This is not a big blockbuster film and that disappoints a lot of people. When watching this film you must keep in mind that all your attention must be in it and must follow along in order to truly enjoy it.

The plot was full of holes, and the logic was either missing or over my head. If people behave in a way which seems incredible that undermines believability."
" Undamaged & Superb Insurrection For Hollywood Science Fiction
",0.6249,0.9779,2017-05-29 00:00:00,9,"The vastness of human pragmatism that science fiction can encompass is unheard-of. It's been circumscribed erroneously with the epigraph about the impossibility of its acts, it's paradoxical to look back and itemize any minutia of our history emerged with a ""that never will happen"" or a ""this is impossible"". And here we're, where was such a the conception of logic and fairness when a group of German Jews and Aryan citizens decided by 44% of utilitarian votes that a midget beast to head up Germany and the selfsame world into a cyclone of blood to the unforgiving netherworld? Or, where was equal, liberating and fair American people who asserted equality and pluralism when they elected a Republican Presbyterian with a citrus wig to lead the crux of the universe?, There is where the literary and film well-known adage glow to its highest expression: ""reality surpasses fiction"". Although modern events are or were influenced by constraint, opinion disparities, ambition or vileness, the other piece has invested us partially as equality organisms in terms of race and eliminator of misogyny. We've got over cataclysms, world wars or an everyday interpersonal uproar, we've interred pride and unified us as human beings in a universal manner; at present, we shouldn't look beyond the stars, we have to plan to get beyond them.Sci-fi genre takes the Maremagnum of a discipline to the extreme in a context in which there may be a high, medium, or minimum probability nature, having the chance to provide certain bi-dimensional items to the work called fiction. It can either derail astray by slated and mostly deficient burial of science opportunities and overflowing imagination until the chimeric (""Star Wars"" & ""Star Trek""), or otherwise, it can avail itself a global thesis supported by foundations with scientific sustenances to a greater or lesser extent, relegating the creative freedom. Big exponents have sprung up in recent decades since Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg gave terror and erudition in the obligatory sci-fi classics of the past (""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Alien"").As its title suggests, the plot revolves around the unplanned landing of twelve alien spaceships, which are likened the 2001 monolith of ""A Space Odyssey""; spectral figures, extraterrestrial resources, those who have arrived with own aim. The ship in which the story focus is one that touched down a few meters away from the greenish surface of Montana, USA. It's so like the American people to first examine and then proceed, using the head rather than the force; thus the US government decides to hire seasoned in dead and alive languages, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) in order to investigate succinct stimulus of its visit. However, they stumble on more unknowns than elucidations due to the harsh context where they're. May do ""they"" use some kind of informational exchange? How will ""they"" discern what they want to express? May do ""they"" grasp human reasoning? It's right here where previously treated space-time works, blended with a linguistic atmosphere which portrayed, in the background, paranoia, and informality of human reaction facing a critical contingency. We're involved in Louise's circumstances, but suddenly, we may feel reflected as in her indigo eyes as in Ian's or anyone's eyes who may be experiencing such an event; the film is about finding a ""why"" about ourselves, not about them. Will we be the threat?""I don't believe in starts or finals"", with this direct thought in voice-over is shaped in front of us a so-called muddled narration; the confidences were within our reach, however, the only thing we did was continue to attest the shortcomings of our language, cemented in times as yesterday, today and tomorrow. Everything makes sense with the concluding scenes of diegetic meaning, clearing up the general purpose of its arrival, donating a gift as harmful as utilitarian for a society who is at Apocalypse's edge. In that moment, we noticed that in the same way she did in ""Nocturnal Animals"", Adams has teased our intellectual coefficient, has attained that we continue under a spell the MacGuffin for, in the last snap, reveal us that was something more intimate, something about you and I that exceeds the rational, something more complex that one invasion; It's a musing about humanity breaks points, and that actually, is the role of Villeneuve's fiction: elucidating by its semiological proposal, the flaws of communication and understanding of the human race, our contraction against fate, our damaged governmental organization, our lack of sensitivity; We're human because someone gives us such seal, but in the cruelest truth, we're primitive societies adorned as organized.A calm pace, measured action, and limited literal entertainment; they want we read about above-mentioned by the language of the celluloid in a noticeable way, it's said that ""reading is work"", the speaker sets a code to which the speaker and receiver assign it the same meaning, there's no a common code, the listener shall decipher the code of the way in which the statement reveals it. They don't want you go to see a film, they demand you watch a reality.An experience that must be pressing for that sci-fi fan who based its passion for rational causes and effects, besides, it ratifies Amy Adams' overwhelming acting ability and thrives on the potential of its director and team resulting in a work worthy of being appended beyond fiction stories, where's the raw essence of cinema. A story glides through few settings with meager lighting, giving priority to the language and the context, discarding dispensable technical terms and CGI sequences to reveal caustically in the last five minutes that nothing has a start and a terminal; paraphrases aren't always put on the table. Why are they here? The gift bequeathed to us was a simple tool, which serves as a duct to carry out sublimely moral, emotional, political, human, philosophical and, at the last stay, cinematographic choices."
" What a crap
",-0.3818,0.9347,2017-05-29 00:00:00,2,"Humans are always curious. When 12 alien ships park in different regions of earth, the scope for the curiosity is endless. It emerges when we ask the most important question ourselves, 'What is the purpose of aliens on the earth?'. Yes, the movie to ask the question and everyone is hoping the lead actress to solve the question. In order to solve this, first humans need to understand the method of communication between aliens. First part of the film is revolving around the interpretation of alien language. So naturally a linguistic expert Luise plays the important role. With her passion towards learning languages, she manages to find a way, visual communication. Interpretation part was some what okay. All subsequent events can be said as mindless crap. What makes the second part of the movie a crap? It is the answer to the major question asked first. The purpose of the aliens is to gift humans a powerful weapon/tool. The tool is universal language and what it can be used for is to see the future. Why are they offering the tool? Because they need help from humanity after 3000 years. What help? Even director would not have thought about that. So were humans able to see future? Yes, indeed, but only one. It is our linguistic expert Luise by taking a risk. She was able to see her married life with her future fellow scientist and also could see her future daughter. She was caught by some disease, and her grown up daughter sat near her death bed. Also there are hints that she mention about this disease to her husband and he leave her because of this. What a tragedy? If she was able to see the future, were she not able to see her husband leaving? She wrote a book about universal language. So with this book what did others do? Did they just play with stains and circles? What happened to world politics and religions? Was world at peace after understanding about future and also about aliens? They are conducting a party towards the end of the film with all world leaders. What happened in between? Do we need to write another movie and submit the script to the director of this movie? What holy words stopped Chinese general from attacking aliens? The aliens as per the movie are poor and kind creatures. One of them died after a bomb blast. With the powerful tool future visualization, why these creatures couldn't stop the death of their fellow members? Okay, leave it. Were they too weak or kind enough to not attack humans? Oh, may be they thought about help from human after 3000 years. What a mess? There are endless questions to be answered in the movie which can be used for making another 10 or more movies like this. And one of the funny thing I noticed is about mentions of Pakistan. As per one news report in the movie, the scientific experts from Pakistan helped the world to interpret the alien language. Holy crap !!! ;) Was director looking for a variety in the movie? May be he is right, expert scientists much like Osama Bin Laden can use their brain more efficiently to interpret the alien language.Don't waste your time on this boring movie. This film is a lesson for futuristic directors, just adding a theme like foreseeing future does not make a movie good."

" A wonderful Arrival
",0.5719,0.9784,2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"This movie has been a blow of fresh air. It is not the typical alien invasion movie. If you are looking for some action kind of ""War of the Worlds"" or ""Spaceship Troopers"" go find something else. This is not your movie. This goes beyond that, to infinity and beyond, as Buzz Lightyear would say.The movie starts with the apparition of 12 alien vessels arriving at different point on Earth (of course one is on the USA, where else?). The military then contact Amy Adam's linguistic in order to help to establish contact with the alien and learn why are they here and what they want. With her is Jeremy Runner's physic helping with the scientific side. So having this established, the movie then flows into a more scientific-human way to approach the issue than what we are used in Mr Bay's movies or as Leeloo from the ""Fifth Element"" would say: ""big bada boom"". No big bada boom or booms. The point is understanding what they want before shooting; something we aren't that used to in this kind of science fiction movies.As in all sci-fi movies visual effects are one actor more and in this one the effects are well created and made with extra care. But of course visual effects without music it like a pizza without cheese, tasteless. The music and the sound effects play and important role in this movie because that is what we are trying to decipher: what are they saying. Needless to say both main actors keep the movie at its best specially Amy Adams (when is she going to win an Oscar please?). As usual, she is fantastic and she can transmit to the audience the weight she has in her shoulders as the interpreter between humanity and the aliens. She is THE protagonist of the movie. Nor the aliens and definitely no one else.This movie tries to reach to you and make you think, not only about what would happen if we were contacted or visited from another species from outer Space, but also it makes you think about humanity as a whole, about life, about your destiny. What would you do?"

The acting and the overall look of the film is very good but it's a bit heavy-handed in its ""why can we all get along?"" message – which seems to be the 'message du jour' in Hollywood these days. I am not a linguist and have no aptitude for languages, but I found most of what Amy Adams' character says about the challenges and potential pitfalls in translating obvious and simplistic, suggesting that we're to believe that the military/CIA/government, who seem to have problems with this concept, must be pretty stupid. In general, I didn't find the early 'translating' scenes, which are central to the plot, very imaginative or convincing (compared to, for example, Stanley Weinbaum's 1934 short story ""A Martian Odyssey""), nor did I find Adam's behaviour, such as removing her protective gear so the aliens could see her, very believable. The movie has been called a 'thinking person's science-fiction movie but don't 'think' about it too much, it's not nearly as clever it seems to think it is and it falls into the usual time-travel paradox problems. Overall, I liked ""Arrival"" but seem to be one of the rare middle-of-the-roaders as this movie seems to inspire love or hate (at least on IMDb)."

Although the movie belongs in the science fiction genre it is very clever and seems so realistic that it makes you think that the events that are taking place are possible. I totally recommend it to everyone that loves dramas but doesn't mind to watch a movie with an original and venturous plot.

I find that 90% of people who write the user reviews have ridiculously high expectations of movies and just love to criticise. The same kind of people who always complain about their food at a restaurant. If you're a new age Sci Fi fan and liked movies such as interstellar, Gravity and Prometheus then I think you'll like this. It's one of those sci fi movies that inspires teenagers to become astronauts (maybe a linguist in this case). It is somewhat emotional, which can lead to feelings where people either hate the movie or love it, hence the polarised reviews. This is the sort of film you'd wished you saw in cinema due to the great visuals (10/10 for me) with a good soundtrack that I first heard in 'shutter island' and 'disconnected'. It would've been interesting if the writers attempted to explain how they deciphered the alien language rather than avoiding explaining it with a voice over by Jeremy renner, but the premise was interesting enough. Not higher than an 8 for me as I loved it at the time but it hasn't stayed with me like a 10/10 movie would. Maybe it's because I can't relate to the main character that much (different sex)."

Basically the premise is that time is circular which means that we can see into the future which is why the aliens showed up. They need our help in 3000 years so they need to show us how to look into the future which does not make any sense. The main character has dreams/ flashbacks/flash forwards about her daughter who died or will die or whatever throughout the film which further bores and confuses one.

Arrival is perhaps one of the best Science Fiction film made in recent times.The film is based on a popular short story called ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang, crafted for screen by Eric Heisserer. The plot revolves around linguistic professor Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams) who is assigned the task of interpreting the language of Alien visitors and understanding the purpose of their visit.Arrival is such a refreshing take on the age-old Alien visiting Earth scenario. Not a scientist, but a linguist is called for help, to save the day. And she happens to be a WOMAN! Yes, Hollywood like many other institutions has had a notorious history when it comes to treatment of women. However, Dennis seems to be a part of the consciousness that actively celebrates women with most of his films having female leads. And since Arrival's heart lies in a mother-daughter relationship, it makes Louise's character all the more central to the story.The mother-daughter relationship however is not as simply understood. The way the film opens one assumes the mother-daughter montage to be a past memory, and the grief of Louise losing her daughter seems to weigh down on her present condition. However, only later is it realized that this was a future memory completely redefining Louise's character.t's quite an achievement to make a non-linear narrative tangible in the linear format of a film. Although this is not the first time this has happened. Filmmakers have been playing with time since the very beginning of film. This brings us to one of the ideas that this film deals with, Non-linear time. Like in film, the time that we perceive in real life is extremely linear, meaning it keeps moving forward. However, that's a very classical understanding of time. Is time really that simple? Can it not pause, stop, move backwards or jump forward? Such ideas have been a staple diet for science fiction writers. And Arrival seems to have a take of it's own.Similarly, the idea of intelligent life existing outside our solar system has fascinated many throughout the years. And such fascination has most colorfully translated into various pieces of art. And why must it not? It's the same kind of curiosity, which resulted in various real life inventions.It is not just ""the apple falling on Newton's head"" scenario but many real life scientific inventions have in fact been inspired by science fiction. Take the Rocket for example. Robert H Goddard who successfully built and launched the first liquid-fueled rocket was immensely influenced by HG Wells' classic novel about a Martian invasion, War of the Worlds. At the age of 16, when he first read the book, he was so moved that he decided to pursue spaceflight as a real life possibility. Science fiction and real world science are not as mutually exclusive as one might think.So what real science possibilities does Arrival bring forward? No one knows, that only time (whatever that is) will tell.Keeping the future possibilities aside, the film currently has a lot to offer from the use of language to visual representation of alien life.The language used by Heptapods is non-linear; having no directions, essentially making it free of time. This further raises a thought that maybe this is how the Heptapods think too, free of the linear human logic. That can be taken as a very interesting comment on our culture of thinking which is based on cause and effect, the very foundation of human logic. This thought is mirrored in dialogues such as ""Language is the foundation of a civilization"" or ""Language is the first weapon drawn in a conflict"".As the film progresses, the humans start to learn their language moving the film into its final act. It is understood that the Heptapods want to 'offer weapon' which causes immediate mass panic and hysteria. However, Louise points out that weapon might not have the same meaning as it does for humans. Heptapods might not even realise the difference between a weapon and a tool. Here's another example of the beautiful ideas that his film is full of and how effortlessly it portrays it. Such ideas are an example of good storytelling, which provokes deep thought rather than serving the audience with all the answers. Arrival like many of Dennis's other films is full of such moments.The film builds up on you slowly. It's not just a one-time affair. It leaves you with a lot of curious thoughts. As the film closes, towards the end it even brings up the paradox of non-linear time. Louise has a lapse of the future memory where she meets General Shang. In the future however she does not remember her past, which is the film present. It seems that only in her future is she realizing the past memory. Maybe, that is the true nature of non-linear time. One might have access to the future and the past but one in no way could influence it. And that is perhaps why the Heptapods arrived in the first place."
" Not what I expected
",0.0,0.9103,2017-05-22 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie when I saw an 8 out of 10 score. The build up of the story and the complexity of the plot were somewhat intellectually stimulating. Unfortunately, with that depth comes the classic naivety of Hollywood movies : US looking for peace, other nations are some whining 6-year-old kids looking for violence by any means necessary. Some reviews actually claim that the movie is good because it speaks about humanity !!! What humanity ? All what has been presented about Russians, Chinese, Sudan was through a screen in some US military base. That's ""humanity"" ?Yet, the movie left me with some great questions : how on earth would a theoretical physics expert become so fascinated by languages and some weird circular calligraphy, when he sees with his own bare f***ing eyes a floating object, defying all what he learned his entire life ?Personally, my first question to aliens would be : how.... HOW DO YOU THAT ?... Imagine the possibilities if such thing existed.... That's what I call intriguing stuff, not some weird souvenir of a Chinese General's wife."
" Great movie with great message
",0.8481,0.9988,2017-05-21 00:00:00,9,"Arrival Scores and Review Script: 9/10 Acting: 8/10 (Adams was amazing but I thought Renner was weird) Visuals + Cinematography: 10/10 Character development and inner thoughts: 9/10 Review: Started 2017 with a great film. First off, let me tell you how much I love the camera work and directions in this movie. The visuals are stunning, and the camera angles add to the emotions of the characters (I love the different angles that used on Amy Adam's face to convey her different feelings). The scene where they introduced us to the UFO in Montana was done beautifully. I WAS SCREAMING because of the aesthetically pleasing nature of the scene. Okay, then the acting was really really freaking good, especially Amy Adam's. Her every movement makes me jump off my seat in excitement or fear or sometimes even joy. Amy's performance is terrific, sending chills down my spine. Notably, in the scene where she talked to Abbott and Costello, her facial expressions were beyond amazing - conveying fascination, fear and pure happiness all in one shot. Stunning performance! The message of the film is poetic and could not be more relevant to today's political situation. The film wants to teach its watchers that they must join forces and work as a united entity to achieve success, which in the movie is the gift, a universal language. The beautiful message is hidden in the dialogues between Ian and Louise. Speaking of the dialogue, there's one conversation in the movie I want to praise particularly. It was delivered towards the end of the movie, where Louis asks Ian ""If you could see your life from beginning to end, would you change it?"" to which Ian answers ""No, I would just find a way to express my love more"". The script is brilliant, and those two lines will go into my book of good lines for sure. Overall Arrival is a thought-provoking, beautifully executed and emotionally touching movie that I would have my future kids sit down and watch with me."
" A Thinking Person's sci-fi film
",0.0,0.9901,2017-05-21 00:00:00,8,"It would be unfair to neatly divide sci-fi cinema into mindless action flicks and intellectual futurist dramas - many movies have elements of both - but if you did make that division, Arrival would be very far into the latter category. This is, after all, a movie about a linguist learning to communicate with aliens, and if that sounds boring to you then you probably will be bored by this movie, because that's very much what you get. But as I say, sci-fi doesn't categorize that neatly, so you also get some suspense and a good deal of deep emotional content.I thought this movie was terrific. It is a movie that tries to create aliens who communicate in a unique, powerful way. I felt it did a pretty decent job of showing the challenges and possible ways to approach learning to communicate with an alien species (although the film acts as though linguists don't already have set protocols to learn new languages, which annoyed me). I can understand people not liking this, because it is pretty slow moving. On the other hand, the one-star user reviews here usually raised all sorts of dumb objections that suggest they just didn't understand the movie. I'm not saying that there aren't legitimate reasons for an intelligent, thoughtful person to dislike this movie, I'm just saying that there are a lot of hostile reviews here by half-wits. So you should ignore those.Amy Adams is excellent, the special effects are well done, the way the arrival effects the world is persuasive, and the movie is clear without spoonfeeding the audience. All in all, an excellent, thoughtful movie."

Started to get a bad feeling when the colonel walked into the linguistics office and demanded her to read out alien ""language"" from another world on the spot... Wtf? Plain stupidity.

Something with aliens, space travel, exploration, etc.I believe there should be different sub-genre's of sci-fi; one for the generic futuristic sci fi setting we are all used to... and others that explore potential scientific approaches to first contact. Unlike Star Trek's flawed trope of universal translator, Arrival explores the simple incidence of that first contact. There is 0 action, there is almost no real PROGRESS in any goals other than communicating in the entirety of the movie. The film feels slow paced but you still felt the suspense. The soundtrack's ominous and eerie tone is also perfect in how they portray things we had not considered about some sci-fi aspects such as gravity manipulation.All the while of exploring a great sci-fi theme, it tells a beautiful story of the character Louise which I believed could have been a separate movie of its own considering how many people can relate to that sort of thing."

The sheer lack of substance and quality in the story makes you hate the reality that you have been sucked in for two hours of a pointless and empty cinematic ordeal, with no substantive ending whatsoever. Do yourself a favor, write down the names of the producers and director, and if you happen have the bad luck of those names ever crossing your screen again, just change what you are watching, or if you can't, then run and don't look back."
" Great movie, spoilers are helpful before the first view
",0.7845,0.9669,2017-05-18 00:00:00,8,"Great movie, spoilers are helpful before the first view.Sci-Fi aficionados probably can't withstand to like it. So did I. The narrative line is cleverly constructed, however, if you watch it the first time probably you just don't get the point if you don't know that the flashbacks in ""reality"" are glimpses of the future. Like another reviewer wrote, you probably will appreciate it more on a second view, once you've understood the setup.Very poetic for everyone who is receptive for the Sci-Fi mystery, able to induce imaginative thoughts. Settings, CGI and sound were very good. The point maybe one does consider after the first enthusiasm is that some parts in fact do not make too much sense, seen objectively (in fiction terms). For example, the stretch until it is understood that a communication works with writing and not with speech, logic would tell viceversa is the best attempt. Also the storyline that humans try hard to be able to communicate in the alien script, meh, given the supposed superiority of that alien race you would expect it's them who should not have too much problems to communicate in an earth writing. But never mind, Sci-Fi remains Sci-Fi, it doesn't take you much to concede these script liberties, when the production as whole is that appealing.I'm prejudiced with Amy Adams, as I find her a very likable presence anyway, but I think she did a good acting job here, the delivery of the doctor/professor was quite convincing."

" Considering all First Contact movies - this is it
",0.0,0.9953,2017-05-16 00:00:00,10,"It's been a long time since I rated a movie with a 10, or even a 9, here on IMDb. But a lot of the reviews show, how a sizable number of people were disappointed, or even angered, by 'Arrival'. The reason that so many viewers were really put off by this movie, while many others praise it enthusiastically, stems from the fine line it walks. If it doesn't suit you from the start, you've got two long hours to get quite mad. A fine line: Not much happening in this film, on the other hand - and following my experience of the movie - a rewarding story-line pushed energetically forward. Oftentimes seemingly lifeless, shot in mostly dull colors, the sparse action oriented parts playing out mostly off screen, or transmitted only via news broadcasts ... What's to like? Well, in my opinion, a lot. Starting with the nuanced, and very humane, performance of Amy Adams, the fitting soundtrack (but no engulfing/immersing orchestral music, actually not much ""music music"" at all), the elegantly weighed photography, but most of all the serene calmness of an intense revelation story at the center of this very intelligent film. I felt like I was taken by the hand and guided by this movie while its grand design unfolded without making a fuss of it. Enough bad poetry: considering the many movies that have hitherto tackled the theme of First Contact, and there were some good ones among them, that I still like to watch, 'Arrival' is now by far the best take there is on this sub-genre with its sometimes proud, and sometimes also very funny, history. That said, I really understand people disliking this movie. If it doesn't get a hold of someone, I'm afraid, there's no redemption to be had with him or her for 'Arrival'. Those who haven't seen it yet, just give it a try."
" Meh
",-0.0772,-0.9421,2017-05-15 00:00:00,5,"Amy Adams is absolutely captivating, as always, to the extent she demands your attention and never, ever lets go. She is infinitely watchable. It's not genius, unless it's contrived by her. It's just her unique form of charisma, one that is to be applauded and treasured, and is worth watching any movie to see.Sadly, that is most of the reason to see Arrival. The movie itself tries very hard to be mysterious, seductive, and interesting. But in the end, it fails because its philosophical and scientific kung fu is weak. Arrival utterly ignores such well-known time paradoxes as the Predestination Paradox and the Bootstrap Paradox and ultimately conspires to have you ignore common sense. To swallow the sugar-sweet ending (and you'll want to), you will have to pretend that an entirely new, completely unexplained paradigm of non-linear time is possible - one that defies reason and is passed without adequate...you know, I want to say ""without adequate"" but in truth it's without ANY explanation.I couldn't pretend to believe it, and that's why I'm giving this movie 5 stars. Amy Adams gets 10."
" Science Fiction Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9893,2017-05-15 00:00:00,9,"Arrival, from the look of all the trailers, seems like a typical Sci-Fi film with not much under the surface. This could not be farther from the truth. Arrival blew every single one of my expectations away and became my favorite movie of 2016. While it begins with the cliché aliens-come-to-earth- for-an-unknown-reason gig, Arrival then unfolds into a complex, intellectual film about the purpose and plan of human beings and their interactions on this planet. The story revolves around Dr. Louise Banks, a linguistics professor portrayed masterfully by Amy Adams, who is recruited by the government to help communicate with the twelve alien spaceships that have landed in random locations around the globe. While the concept comes off as simple, the techniques by which the filmmakers execute the communication elevate this movie to brilliant levels. Visually, the movie is breathtaking. Large, beautiful shots are used throughout the run time in addition to great color and sound design. The film addresses motives such as fate, loss and love while still providing an entertaining thrill ride with well-developed characters. I cannot list off the top of my head one thing I would change with this movie; it's execution and emotional payoff worked wonders."
" Dramatic science fiction roller coaster
",0.0,0.9061,2017-05-15 00:00:00,9,"I went into this film aware of its reputation and the praises it received from critics; and rightfully so. The film is subtle and simple, it doesn't blast your senses with a lot of special effects and convoluted plot lines, though it does require you to pay attention. However, it does so in such a way that your attention is held without being overwhelmed. The film conveys a nice balance of tension and drama and portrays a reasonable, real-world reaction to a sudden alien presence. Now, perhaps it was the wine or the fact that I have a young son and am already emotional compromised, but this film had me in tears from start to finish. It hit me on an emotional level but also made me think. The plot focuses on time and communication, both of which are extremely important, and the significance of timely communication. It is amazing to me that the subject of communication and how easily it can be misinterpreted or misunderstood is such a universal thing, and yet people in this world too often don't stop to really think about it. Too many things have to happen on a dime and real conversations are lost within a person's personal desires and views; minds can so easily be changed if we simply take the time to listen and communicate."
" Giant floating bananas disconcert the Chinese
",0.0,0.9915,2017-05-13 00:00:00,3,"The banana is the most remarkable of fruits. Not only was it explicitly designed by Jehovah Himself for the health and pleasure of higher primates, the banana has contributed more to comedy than any other member of the Plant Kingdom. For example, who can forget this classic schtick —BURLESQUE SHOWGIRL: Why do you have a banana in your ear?BAGGY-PANTS COMIC: Eh?BURLESQUE SHOWGIRL: (shouting) Why do you have a banana in your ear??BAGGY-PANTS COMIC: You'll have to speak louder, I have a banana in my ear.And of course, there are all those wonderful banana-precipitated pratfalls performed by every farceur since Charlie Chaplin. But alas, in spite of the banana's inherent jocose propensity, the gargantuan gravity-defying interstellar bananas that are the star attractions of this film elicit not a single titter, let alone a full-throated chortle. This is unfortunate because ""Arrival"" must be some kind of absurdist comedy. Otherwise, how does one account for the backstory sequence serving as the film's frontispiece which centers on the most laughably sentimental demise since Little Nell kicked the bucket? It's pretty much downhill from there with precious few yucks to ward off the encroaching ennui.All joking aside science fiction is a tough genre that Hollywood routinely fails to pull off. Offhand I can think of but two that entirely met expectations: the brilliant 1950's B-picture ""It Came from Outer Space"" and Stanley Kubrick's enigmatic masterpiece, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". These films are relevant in context since they both address the theme employed by ""Arrival"", specifically Man's first encounter with an off-world intelligence.""It Came from Outer Space"", faithfully based on a story by the remarkable Ray Bradbury, deals with a visitation by creatures that, though as physically alien as cheap 1950's special effects can realize, reason by a logic not dissimilar to our own. Crash-landed on a planet inhabited by well-armed and violence-prone primitives the aliens execute a reasonable yet desperate plan of escape. Through the aid of a human astronomer, they manage to repair their spaceship and depart, leaving the scientist longing for their eventual return. Kubrick took the opposite tack in his magnum opus. His aliens are apparently incomprehensible, yet they are definitely purposeful. They no sooner land on Earth, or more precisely their machine does, then they commence to execute their plan, which is the manipulation of the evolution of just another undistinguished root-munching anthropoid into an ingenious predator for purposes they keep strictly to themselves.It is reasonable to assume that one or the other situation will apply if and when real aliens make contact — either we shall understand them or we won't, but in any case, their visit will be purposeful. ET isn't going to cross the galaxy just to sit in its starship and idly twiddle its appendages as the banana-nauts of ""Arrival"" spend much of movie doing, or more precisely NOT doing. Not doing stuff is much of what happens, or not happens, in ""Arrival"", which makes an inquisitive mind wonder what the popcorn one failed to buy when first traversing the lobby tastes like. And speaking of appendages this movie's aliens have tentacles. Yet more galactic squidoids... yeah."
" Just remember this is science fiction
",0.0,0.9951,2017-05-13 00:00:00,7,"For a generation who has probably never even heard of Fellini or Antonioni, this could well be a confusing or boring film. For those who find it appealing, do try to read the original story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang. Flashbacks have become common practice in movie making. Admittedly, flashbacks sometimes made a film, but the technique has been over- used in the last decade in attempts to elevate the ""artistic"" element in movie making. In ""Arrvial"", such segments are in fact not flashbacks per se. One of the key idea in the movie (as well as the short story it was based upon) is about our own conception of time (and time ""travel"", into the future). The most significant verbal interchange in the entire movie occurred early in the movie, between the characters played by Renner and Adams, that brought up the Sapir- Whorf hypothesis, that language could potentially be what constrains our thoughts, and thus our intellectual, psychological, and sociological endeavours.Ted Chiang, as I remember vaguely, has written elsewhere about the possibility of a language which is deterministic, in the sense that the first ""word"" uttered could determine the entire ""sentence"" to come. I think he was drawing on certain logographic/pictorial language that tells an entire story with one ""picture"" - in the film, they made an attempt to portray how they decipher the alien language, showing the ""translated"" English words around the alien symbols. (Notice also that the aliens did not trace/draw those symbols in a sequential fashion, the entire symbols somehow resolved from some ""random"" swirl of ink, and when Adams tried to mimic the symbol, she said she couldn't do it using both hands - because she was conditioned to a sequential mode of language processing.) I think Chiang's original idea, which the movie also attempted to capture, was the notion of a nonlinear dimension of time, which hinted at the aliens' ability to somehow ""forsee"" the future - they told Adams that they were trying to help humans now so that we humans can in turn help them when they will be in trouble in a few thousands years. Adams, having been initiated into the alien language, no longer perceived time in a linear fashion, hence all the apparent flashbacks, which were merely snippets of her consciousness which were no longer bound by the normal progression of time. In Chiang's short story, Adams was writing/telling the story of her child's life (before it was born) when the future was already ""known"" to her, which hearkens back to what she said in the movie about ""...despite knowing the journey... and where it leads... I embrace it. And I welcome every moment of it.""All in all, I think this is a well-made movie, with some novel ideas (for a change). Amy Adams did a great job portraying the protagonist - it WAS her movie. Jeremy Renner was believable in a supporting role. The bit about non-zero-sum game and international cooperation is a welcome message in today's polarizing world politics and religious fanaticism. One could also surmise the fact that Adam's character was ""blessed"" with the ""gift(weapon)"" of the alien's language was due to her willingness to approach them, first by taking off her protective suit, and subsequently in running out to the alien ship when the evacuation order was issued - here is a faint echo of Chiang's notion that an initial gesture (word) can determine the course/outcome of an entire interaction (sentence), from the start. A final word for those who voted thumbs down outright: our ability (including my own) to comprehend this movie, or the original story of Chiang, might well be tempered by our own individual linguistic idiosyncrasies. A movie to be watched more than once."

The military maintains a sizable presence in the movie, but it never really gets to that hysterical point (sure, the planet's armed forces are ready to go to war, but there's also a surprising level of restraint). And I liked that the real focus was on communication, not just with the aliens, but also between our sovereign nations.There is a surprise at the end (I don't think twist is the right word because that evokes Shyamalan, and this isn't that movie), and to a certain extent, that's really the point of the movie - even though it's handled with depth and sensitivity. But up until that point, this is Amy Adams' show. I've always liked here, but of her performances, this is one of my favorites.

Extra-Terrestrial objects/lifeforms arrived at our planet surface and they/it are/is looking for some humans who can easily communicate with. The aliens used music instrument for communication (How cool is that!!!). In this Arrival (2016), The heptapods are not ... so ... talkative, but they like to write instead. Anyways, their ships are similar to the monolith in '2001: A Space Odyssey' ... ""It's full of stars.""Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Hawkeye ... oh, ehh ... Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) came to have a chat with heptapods. After that, the film was interrupted with flashbacks. It is not bad if there were only a few flashbacks, but there were a ton of flashbacks. Swapping again and again. You have to imagine that how fun a movie is if their have too much intermissions. No doubt if viewers have a bad mood. At last, they were not flashbacks at all, but Dé·jà vus instead. At this moment, a question is came, Dr. Banks saw a real future or it is just illusions that heptapods rendered in her brain, which is to persuade her.

Let's start with the problems: 12 spaceships land all over earth and everyone's given a permanent work holiday...like life just suddenly stopped because 12 overpriced (hey, they're imported!!) fuzzy pickles situated themselves over future Whole Foods locations? Don't people still need food, hospitals, education, etc? Life can't simply stop waiting for Whole Foods to place a UPC on the spaceships. Next: Any alien ship that can suspend gravity and travel through space is going to have vastly superior technology to our own; plus the aliens wouldn't have landed if they were the least bit worried about the Earth's existing weaponry. Duh! You really think guns and bombs pose any worry? When did Neil Blomkamp become the director? So, we have a military know-nothing direct the language interaction program and call the shots? Not likely. As though there's anything to ""give away"" to these aliens. Lastly, any species enabled with space faring ships won't have too many problems with basic communication...I know that's a grand assumption but, really. The whole approach to ""teaching"" the aliens wasn't much more sophisticated than training my neighbor's one-eyed dog. Piloting spaceships across the void requires lots and lots of incredible technology AND communication (certainly between the spaceships). Lastly, this whole idea of time travel and time distortion as being a necessary component of ""teaching"" humankind to interact is surely a stretch into the absurd (though this didn't stop many other movies from doing this, such as Interstellar). Oh, I should also mention that HP and Epson are running a special on squid ink this month in case any of the 12 ships are running low."

" So much potential - and most of it wasted
",-0.5367,-0.1943,2017-05-05 00:00:00,3,"After I had initially read about the movie, I thought this was going to be an interesting film exploring the nature of another life form's communication and how different from the human way of speaking and writing it actually could be. And therefore difficult to understand. Because why do all the aliens in movies communicate with sound (which of course happens to be in the hearing range of humans) or why do they always use some form of visual script? Why do they always use the logic and grammar of human language? Well, who cares. Because this turned out to be just another Sci-Fi movies filled with clichés, which could work, but due to the missing plot it was just extremely boring. Of course they also communicate with some Mumbo Jumbo language and script that somehow gets translated. How that works is not explained, our genius linguist just understands. Following that is the usual: The military guys who desperately want war, especially the evil Chinese and Russians, and a subplot with the daughter and colleague-turned-husband - the emotional love must-have, I guess. And that's all there is. The aliens just leave and leave the main character with the main feature of the language: Once you understand it, you can see the future somehow. The most interesting part of that - its philosophical and logical implications - is not even touched once. You could call that thought-provoking and intellectual, I just call it lazy.Only good parts about the movie are the visuals and cinematography, which is done quite aesthetically."
" Arrival is a departure from sensory overload (Sci-fi for adults)
",-0.3612,0.9531,2017-05-04 00:00:00,8,"One could argue that science fiction, in this particular realm of adult thought and understanding, is all just lessons in humanity, exposed quickly on TV through shows like ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Star Trek"", but here further developed into a non-linear experience. It is something beautiful, if not fully understood, but more of a film to experience. Arrival brings a new hero to this genre in the form of Linguistics Professor plucked from her home by the U.S. Military to one of twelve alien landing sites to interpret their intent. The style is deliberate and instructional, but never pandering down, picking up whether others have failed. Amy Adams carries us past a myriad of assumptions and rush to judgments vigilantly. She represents the science of language and it's potential. How can you not get behind that. The atmosphere of this movie is the hidden special effect, not blue screen space wars. That the director brings us the beauty of the challenge faced in the movie should be applauded ...and for those who prefer flying space ships and cool space outfits with blasters, there's a franchise movie awaiting your cash."

Someone needs to check their math. I took the time to look at the most recent 100 reviews. Total score 371 which for that sample gives us an IMDb movie rating of 3.7. That number I can believe! 45 of those 100 reviewers gave it a one!!! This movie is maddeningly awful."
" Overwrought drivel.
",0.0,-0.524,2017-05-03 00:00:00,2,"In a nutshell, large floating squid things who have chosen several locations on Earth (amongst other planets) for some kind of cosmological game-show set a challenge to the competing teams with the winner being the first group to translate the squid people's odd language. Crack the code and you get, erm, something - perhaps the secret of seeing all time at once. I'm not too sure as I had drifted off a bit at this stage having become annoyed at the gravity reversal thing.... Of the humans, Jeremy Renner plays a physicist who doesn't physic but does exude an air of someone who would much rather be anywhere else than on the set of this unintentionally hilarious film and appears to be little more than a sperm donor. Linguist Amy Adams is brought on board to crack the communication/game show tasks. ""How?"", you ask, ""by some kind of referral to universal constants?"" Nope. By drawing on a whiteboard, shouting and pointing. Englishmen abroad have been doing this for years. ""Two pints of lager, please.. I SAID TWO PINTS OF LAGER"". Eventually the increasingly manic Amy (haunted by tediously repetitive flashback/forwards) solves the mystery, although as the squid people see all time they would have known that at the beginning. The final 'reveal' sledgehammered into the film was a depressing anticlimax, mainly because we had all guessed but also because the viewer just doesn't care by that stage. Oh and Forest Whitaker is in it. He's probably wondering why too."
" A thinking man's 'Independence Day'
",0.0,0.9942,2017-05-02 00:00:00,7,"Oh, no – giant alien spaceships arrive on Earth and hover over every major city with disastrous (and most likely CGI-heavy) consequences! Yes, we've seen this tired and strained plot for many decades (albeit the slightly older films relied on strings holding up the UFOs, but that was still pretty 'high0-bidget' at the time!). However, in this case, the aliens actually don't go straight into nuking every recognisable landmark they can find on Google Maps. Instead, they actually try to have a chat. However, just because they've left the White House in one piece, doesn't mean things go smoothly. Basically, they have a completely different language to us, therefore the American military enlist the help of a reclusive language specialist (Amy Adams) to help translate.Naturally, there's the obligatory 'love interest' for Adams. This comes in the form of Jeremy Renner, who is likable for what he's there for. Forest Whittaker is always good at pretty much whatever he does, so he's not out of place as the army general in charge of the operation.I knew this basic premise of before I sat down to watch the film and did wonder whether it was possible to string the entire film out for around two hours on this. And, I'm pleased to say that it actually worked. You see the alien ships land in various countries around the world and, although we obviously only really focus on America's involvement with them, we get to hear about how other countries handle them. 'Arrival' is one of those films where, in some ways, it's very difficult to review. If I give away too much it may spoil certain elements of the film. If the basic premise interests you (and you're not expecting wild aerial dogfights against waves of invading flying saucers) then you should definitely give it a go. The film is basically a mystery. You know the aliens are here for a reason, but you have to learn what it is at the same pace as the film's characters. And, if you don't mind the wait, you should enjoy the slow burn.I definitely enjoyed it, but, as I know the ending now, it does mean that it's never going to be as mysterious the second time around. I'd certainly go for a re-watch one day, but you'll only ever get to see it for the first time once and be totally in the dark as to what the ending will entail. Sorry I'm being a bit vague, but, if it interests you, the less you know the better. Either way, at least it proves that you don't need epic space battles or global destruction to make a movie interesting. And this one even raises a few questions in terms of what one person perceives as 'language' may be totally different from another."
" A film that nails the feeling of Science Fiction
",0.128,0.9864,2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Arrival, directed by Denis Villeneuve, and starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, is an interesting film about first contact with an alien species. The film follows Linguistics professor Louise Banks, as she works with the US government to determine how to communicate with the aliens.I'll start off by saying this film is a bit of a slow burner. It takes what is really important in the science fiction genre - the wonder of the unknown, the imagination, and the feeling of inferiority in the face of massive ideals, and really nails them. This is one of the best science fiction films I have seen in many years, and may rival my love for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The film has a methodical pace, a cracking ending, and some excellent introspective human elements. Its take on time and space is also very interesting. The film left me frequently at the edge of my seat, as the tension ratcheted up. The movie looks at a plausible scenario for first contact (plausible for the genre, at least). There is very little action in the film, and instead the focus is on learning, adapting and communicating, and follows Louise's character closely through the film, as she struggles with her life, the stress of the job, and a dawning realization of what it means to be a human.I cannot praise this film enough. It represents hard science fiction at its finest, and is an excellent, terse and concise addition to the genre. It can be easily recommended for fans of science fiction, but those not too into the genre may not feel the same way. Even so, from my perspective, it is a wonderful film, and may in fact become a favourite of mine after a few more watches. A great effort from all involved, and worthy of great attention."
" Pretty, shallow and kind of ridiculous
",0.1045,0.9551,2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"Alien encounters are so interesting, and it's great to see a film where we don't just fight the aliens. But the film also deals with both personal and political drama, which I didn't care for. I cared for the aliens' intentions and language, which was explored too superficially. Those were the real mysteries to me, and should perhaps have remained so in my opinion. But after a thorough exploration of communication and its pitfalls.Instead the aliens seem more like a plot device that provides the protagonist with Knowledge. And the Knowledge is very dubious as well. It stretches the idea of linguistic relativity way too far. It's too unbelievable and kind of ridiculous as well when you think about it.It doesn't make it better that I feel I've seen the plot twist before (and recently). The alien language has the same effect as the black hole has on Mattew Mcconaughey's character in Interstellar. Is this the best you writers can come up with nowadays?The film is pretty, though. I like the tempo. But it's a missed opportunity."
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.996,2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"I went into this not expecting much, just another Hollywood flick about nasty aliens and heroic humans saving the hordes of homo sapiens infecting the globe. I came away surprised at the intelligent story and the great atmosphere of the movie.Yes, there are a few plot holes here and there, but less than some have mentioned there being. The following are true:1) NASA and the US government have almost certainly people on staff that specialise in communicating with aliens, if such an event would occur. Probably have a whole bunch of plans set up for such an eventuality. Them being caught with their pants down like this is a bit silly. 2) The Aliens being able to understand the audio and visual input Louise is giving them is very unlikely. I mean, I hardly hear her whisper in that suit. However, here comes the whole idea of the film into play, they understand her because they ALREADY HAVE. Same as she suddenly understands them by having future-memories, they would have known what she was trying to say because they can remember it from the future. She also learns it much faster as you would normally expect because she already has done so, even subconsciously. It's not a superpower, it's because at one point she has learned to think like they do and that means that her present self also does. From the moment they meet she is in this forever loop. 3) Nothing is explained about why they are there and how POOF their ship can disappear!It is explained, the gift/weapon is what humanity will use to save the aliens in the future. The Aliens already KNOW that's is all they have to do since this enough to set the humans on the right path. This is the skill they need. We do not know the threat yet, maybe it's actually from us? It's okay to leave it like this, keep some mystery in the story. Not everything needs to be overly explained away. The ship, well possibly it's not even there to begin with. It's rather like explaining the workings of a TV to a cat. Is the rabbit really there because you can see it and hear it?The aliens tell them that the 12 ships are 1, and everything happens at the 12 locations at the same time as well. They give out the exact same information to everyone.It could be a recording even sent from their dimension/ world and just beamed at 12 locations for convenience. Also explains why there is no radiation or anything coming off the ship. That we don't understand exactly how this works and it's not explained is good, gives you something to ponder. The future-memories sometimes get a bit much, certainly at the end. But that's also the heart of the movie. If you know your future, that you will have a child but they will die from a deadly horrible disease...would you still do it? How would you live with knowing the future? She accepts this in the end, when in her future-memory he ask her if she wants to make a baby, she says yes. Knowing he will leave her because he can't deal with the truth and the child will die. I don't know, but all of this makes the movie pretty special. And makes me forgive the small flaws there are in the logic of some things. The actors are pretty amazing too, although apart from Amy they are a bit under used. The music and cinematography are excellent and really left me stunned. If you are looking for an independence day action flick, you are going to be bored silly. If you want to immerse yourself in this strange reality, please watch as you will probably love it or at least be intrigued by it."
" Sci-Fi Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9661,2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"The first time i read Arrival's synopsis, i loved the premise mostly because it doesn't follow the formula of classic alien in which the alien specie tries to conquer Earth. After i watched this movie, it really saddens me that it only won one Oscar (Sound Editing) despite being nominated in 8 categories.The story begins when twelve spaceships inexplicably land on different parts of Earth and cause mass hysteria around the globe because no one knows what is the purpose of their arrival, which triggers a discussion whether the heptapod (name of the alien race) wants war or peace. But since the aliens are letting people enter their spaceship for two hours a day to study them, US military sends linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to understand the heptapod language and find out the meaning of their landing on Earth. Alongside this mission is Col. Weber (Forest Whitaker) and theoretical physicist Ian Donnely (Jeremy Renner).With astounding visuals, great acting (specially from Amy Adams) and by bringing a new concept to the sci-fi genre, Arrival is the most original film of the nominees for Best Picture."

" ARRIVAL: Engaging and Imaginative

ARRIVAL delivered on both fronts; entertaining and good storytelling. I very much enjoyed ARRIVAL and I felt thoroughly engaged throughout the entirety of the film. I do get it how everyone is different and some of the negative reviews certainly confirm this fact. Personally, I found myself deeply absorbed by the story. Just the same, I can understand the comments concerning some of the questionable directing examples such as the unimpressive method used to initially make contact with the aliens - (tiny whiteboard and dry erase marker with crude handwriting). For me, I chose to gloss right over such trivial moments in order to remain engaged with the story which was riveting and imaginative.Some of my favorite sci-fi films are the more cerebral type: The Day the Earth Stood Still – 1951, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Contact and Close Encounters of the Third Kind just to name a few. Part of the entertainment I take away from such films was the thinking journey that was involved. ARRIVAL easily falls into this example.Amy Adams performance was most effective in helping me to navigate the complexities of what was going on. Bravo to Amy for the impressive and moving lead role as well as hats off to fellow performances by both Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker. I really enjoyed the film and I highly recommend it."

All the while it lays the breadcrumbs for a third act reveal (I'd hesitate to use the word twist here) that may not satisfy everyone. I come away feeling the need to ponder it a bit more, but feeling certain that it gets short shrift in an all too quick tie up that undercuts its impact."

Would you write the word human on a clipboard and show it to the aliens? No, of course not, you're not an idiot, but that's what the lead actress did in this movie. That's how bad it is.FFS. I've never had to write a review before and I'm worried about the state of sci-fi in Hollywood movies. I'm convinced that sci-fi writing has now officially regressed because of this film."
" Arrives in time
",0.0,0.9712,2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"The movie is based on an adaptation of a short story by Ted Chiang called the 'The Story of your life'. This sentence itself should raise curiosity as you'd wonder how the story of one's life can be related to a sci-fi movie about Aliens arriving on earth. This and recommendations from my friends drew my attention to this 2016 released film starring Amy Adams and Jeremy 'renner', yup the quotes are there for a reason.With the opening scene of a huge french window overlooking a lake with lights being all murky, it feels like a Sunday morning on a rainy day when you woke up too early. These light effects continue throughout​ the running time, and together with the intermittent flashbacks/forwards of Louise (Amy) make you dizzy. However, don't get me wrong, the film manages to arise enough curiosity, and makes up for it's lack of grandiose, pace and action with scenes full of feel, emotion and awe.The premise is a regular one, alien ships arrive on earth (12 of them), spread across the world and as usual, we get to stick to the one which landed in US of A. Many films have started thus, only to make it an expedition of Earth's annihilation or of some adventure of a miscreant individual alien. This one, however manages to keep it slow, allowing the humans to speculate, explore and attempt to communicate with the aliens, who strangely seem to be not in any hurry. So, humanity's less known linguists come to the fore to help decipher the answer to 'whats your purpose of visiting earth?'. And of course, scientists and military to assist them.Ian, the scientist (played by Jeremy) acts as the side kick to Louise, who comes up with innovative ideas on communication while dealing with her inner turmoil of a dear personal loss. There are few fun moments with the CIA agent and the aliens, but generally a sobre feeling prevails. While keeping the dialogue and even the bgm minimalistic, director focuses on getting the feel of each scene just right. Without much spoilers, i can reveal that the plot revolves around varied topics, highlighting human's basic nature of self protection, lack of unity, self doubt and paucity of trust; while applauding the ability to work together when required and resolve problems with an analytical approach. However, the focus is on that abstract variable which we define as 'time'. The movie is a must watch for those sci-fi loving folk, who are by now tired of all the typical Hollywood blockbusters and are interested in more realistic fiction focusing as much on the story as it does on it's visuals. For others, I'd still recommend 'Independence day'."

They didn't do any thing but look like giant squids. The breakdown of society, who cares. The fact that the aliens ship defies physics, why would they think human weapons would do anything? The plot 'twist' was so idiotic. I don't recommend this movie. I feel stupid because my husband came in near the beginning of the movie and said ""Don't watch this movie, it's boring.""

It all starts promising with strange things visiting our planet, and with interesting extraterrestrial octopus life forms trying to communicate with us. The end was also not bad, but the problem is everything between the beginning and the end. It's all way too slow and too long of the same story. Amy Adams trying to figure out the language, Amy Adams thinking, Amy Adams in deep thoughts, Amy Adams figuring everything out etc. After a while, watching Amy Adams in deep thoughts over and over again, it's getting boring.

" A response to this year's bad sci-fi films
",-0.5423,0.9936,2017-04-22 00:00:00,6,"I think we are all familiar with movies that have aliens coming to earth and not destroying things. This is not something that in this century hasn't been shown much in science fiction films. In the 20th century it was much more common with movies like close encounters, E.T, the day the earth stood still, contact and others which probably weren't as great. This century so far has had only one movie like that which is district 9. Everyone went to see it and they were blown away. It was obvious there would be no movie like that in this century. We were wrong apparently. Along came Arrival. When it was announced I was excited and it didn't disappoint. Not only is it well acted, not only is it well plotted and not only is it smart, the greatest thing about Arrival is that it is original. Most aspects of Arrival are original, from the look of the aliens to the look of the spaceship as well as its concepts and pace. I guess what will fascinate most is the incredible twist ending which will I am sure in the future be as iconic as the twist in 1968s planet of the apes. I won't spoil the ending for you so don't worry. The performances were pretty good but best of all was Amy Adam's performance which should win an Oscar. The concepts of this movie were pretty thought provoking and original mostly. The look of the spaceship and aliens was original as I already said but cannot be described. I highly recommend this movie for anyone and I will give it a ⅘ for being original and smart."

It shows images of the mind of the main actor, Louise, the language specialist who will learn to communicate with the Aliens.Logically, the images can't be anything else but memories from the past, where she was left by her husband, and lost her child to a rare illness.And then in the end, she understands the language of the Aliens, telling her that time is not linear, and that they give humans their language to understand that they will need humanity in 3000 years.But how can future be predetermined, and maybe predictable, if time is not linear? Louise can't do anything else but live what wasn't her memories, but her visions of the future.I won't take that path of illogical fallacy reasoning, I recommend reading ""How to think about weird things"" Critical thinking for a new age, because in our time of information, people obviously lack the ability to handle that information with reason, to rate this movie so high.The message of the movie is misleading New Age BS.

And was there a young child that looked around and said ""Are you people insane?""Okay, I sincerely doubt there was an emperor has no clothes kid on the set. But the idea that this is some smart movie that will make intelligent people think about what divides us instead of what unites us is type of trite belief that ISIS will sit around a campfire with us if only we would quit shooting at them.Forget the bad bad science of the movie where a linguist can learn to communicate with the aliens in such a relatively short time. Forget that the only woman in the film is the one that has the desire to make peace instead of war with the aliens (perpetuating the belief that if women were in charge of the world we would have an end to wars).Forget that such an advanced civilization could actually find us in the vast universe and still not figure out a way to communicate with us instead of we with them.No, the worst thing about this movie is that it telegraphed every scene 10 minutes ahead. I found myself mouthing dialogue seconds ahead (It wasn't meeting them. It was meeting you) and hoping against hope there would some unforeseen twist like the alien being the father of the little girl though that's a science fiction cliché. Didn't anyone reading the script find themselves thinking they've seen this movie before? How many movies have been made where the brave voice in the wilderness can't get anyone to listen to them before mob gets out their guns and start shooting? Will she get through to the Chinese boss before the authorities have her shot? Gee, will Lassie get the townsfolk to understand that Timmy fell down the well? The director must have kept telling Amy Adams to tone it down because she never really does more than act pensive as she is made more and more aware of what the key is. You'd have thought it was every day that she met some aliens and saved the world.Jeremy Renner plays a physicist though he could have been playing a travelling anvil salesman and it probably wouldn't have changed a single word of his dialogue. If he did any real physics in the movie I must have blinked as it went by.And whose idea was it to cast Forest Whitaker? What a waste of talent. He probably didn't have to memorize any lines because it was obvious what he had to say. They could have gotten a film student at scale for how much his skills were used.Unlike some I didn't consider the movie a waste of my time.

Like all great sci-fi, the film is intellectually challenging and potentially perspective-altering, and I was actually shocked by how hard the ending hit me. Unlike most other emotionally powerful films, my reaction was less about an attachment to the growth and arcs of its characters and more about the deep resonance of the film's ideas and central theme.Arrival has been compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey, and to a point that holds as both films are about humankind being changed by extra- terrestrial encounters. However, artistically they couldn't be much farther apart. 2001 was technically and scientifically exacting in its attempt to tell its cold and impersonal story, while Arrival simplifies things and skimps on the details of the science in order to better service the humanity of the tale. While 2001 is without a doubt a masterpiece, Arrival may have actually meant MORE to me, even through its flaws, because Arrival - as good as it is - isn't perfect. The characters are somewhat one-note and viewers that have seen Close Encounters of the First Kind may be turned off by some of the curious choices various entities in this film make.The story goes like this - Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a foreign languages expert sleepwalking through her daily life due to grief over the death of her daughter to a rare disease. At the start of the film, 12 alien ships arrive, hovering silently in apparently random places around the globe. Louise is recruited by the Colonel Weber (Forrest Whittaker) for the U.S. military to help translate the alien language in order to find out their purpose for coming to Earth. She's assigned to head a team being run by Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) that is set up at the base of the ship hovering within U.S. borders.She arrives, meets the aliens, and starts to attempt to understand a creature that is wholly different from humans. Here is where Arrival starts to stand out from many other films about first contact, in that it treats the aliens as aliens. They think differently, so they are going to try to communicate differently. The rest of the movie is about how Banks learns to communicate with the aliens on the clock set by Russia and China, who get suspicious about the aliens' motives and make questionable decisions and unnecessary leaps of logic that serve the story in a McGuffinesque way.Of course, the Chinese aren't the only ones that make curious decisions and questionable leaps of logic. I'm pretty sure the U.S. government already has a team of linguistic, biology, psychology, and astronomy experts ready to go in the event of an arrival like this, so the fate of the world doesn't rest on one egghead. Their study of the language happens on occasion with those movie leaps of logic where the realizes what the answer to some question has to be even though there are probably three or four other very plausible explanations. Banks is a bit of a Mary Sue character in this regard - she's the hero that is fighting against everyone else but is never actually wrong, and has no real flaws other than the trauma that turns out to be important to the story.Artistically, the Arrival is mesmerizing. The score and cinematography are dreamy and disarming, and the the actors slow down to allow the film to breathe. It's actually rather amazing that both this and the far more intense film Serpico were made by the same director, and demonstrates that Villeneuve has an absolute mastery of his craft. There is nothing showy at all, no moments of true beautiful visual awe as in Close Encounters or 2001 and no signature camera angles or movements. Other than Banks, none of the the characters are not particularly fleshed out, and none of the actors has any Oscar-worthy moments of bombast. The only thing important here is the story, and Villeneuve subdues everything else to allow the ideas behind this to take center stage. It takes its time sink its teeth in us and force us to follow us to where it's leading, pacing itself and its discoveries in a way that can occasionally feel frustrating but are worth it in the end. And oh, boy, is it ever worth it. The opinion of this movie that the viewer walks away with will largely depend on two things: how they handle the subtly flippant attitude toward actual science, and how they respond emotionally to the final act. Arrival gets at a couple pretty deep questions that I don't recall having seen in a film before - and certainly not in this way - but accepting the power of this movie requires buy-in. I sat in my seat crying - literally crying - over one of Louise's lines of voice-over near the end of the movie, and I can't imagine that line having as much power without any of the hard work - and, yes, questionable plot decisions - being a part of this film up until that point. Would every viewer watch this movie if they knew what was going to happen in it? Maybe, maybe not. Arrival is a movie that may not be for everyone, but like all great science-fiction, it may just make you rethink how you experience the world around you."

I think the reason I love it so much is because of how the relationship between Amy Adams and the aliens changes and gets more beautiful. Also as you watch the relationship between Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams develop, and then you find out that the flashback's turn out to be forshadowments, which was a beautiful touch. The aliens were very lovable. The music completely adds to the film, and it is really beautiful. 10/10."

Arrival is a competently made movie and unusual, but not worthy of all of the 8 and 9-level scores it's been garnering.Plot: testicular-shaped aliens traveling in testicular-shaped spacecrafts land all over Earth and we poor, ignorant man-animals scramble and panic, not knowing if the aliens come in peace like the ones from Mars Attacks or if they are, in fact, interested in probing ""Uranus."" As this is a spoiler-free review I won't reveal the ""big twist,"" but a keyword rhymes with the word ""lobe.""

",-0.7351,0.6701,2017-04-16 00:00:00,4,"The movie is underexposed. The sound is muddy. I think they did this deliberately to enhance the mysteriousness of the squid creatures from outer space. But the net result is you can't tell what is going on.The movie is very confusing, jumping about chaotically in space and time with very few clues where you are. It is downright irritating.The heroine is quite insipid.The plot makes no sense. Our heroine is yanked out of bed in the middle of the night by military types to try to decrypt an alien language. Why her? She speaks Pakistani. Huh?? She is put in charge, then no one listens to what she says. They don't just disagree, they refuse to let her say anything.They crack the code in two breakthroughs without explanation. The heroine discovers she can see the future with absolute clarity. Oddly, she had never noticed any such ability before. Seriously?? Everyone but her wants to go to war with the squid people. She prevails, but what she did to change all those minds is a mystery.For the last bit of the dialogue, they pasted together Hallmark card verses. It is nauseatingly saccharine.Nothing in the movie makes sense. It is maddening as a mosquito bite."
" Faint yet High Praise
",0.5574,0.9984,2017-04-16 00:00:00,9,"Arrival I'm a bit late in my review on this film, but, when you consider the theme of time as a non linear force that threads its way through this film, perhaps I'm not actually late at all. I haven't been a very big fan of director Denis Villeneuve's work. Those who know me, know that I love odd and I love weird, but I just can't bring myself to forgive Villeneuve for what I consider to be the silly and unearned metaphor at the ending of Enemy or the long overwrought pointless tension of Prisoners. I just didn't buy into either of those film's premises. I understood what Villeneuve was trying to do in both films. So please stop trying to tell me that I just missed the point. I got the point in both cases. I just thought that the point was stupid. I probably would not have started watching Arrival if I had have known it was directed by Villeneuve. But in this film, Villeneuve seems to take a page out of Terrence Malick's playbook in the way that the story fades in and out of time with a dreamlike quality. And that gives Arrival exactly the right tone for its subject matter. The film, about a translator who is brought in to try to translate the language of aliens who have mysteriously visited the earth in different locations around the earth, falls down in a few places with the logic of its science and the behaviour of some of the characters. And it's not an easy movie. At times its dreamlike quality leaves you struggling to make sense of what exactly is going on or why you should care about what's going on. But in the end Arrival strives to be better than just another visited by aliens movie. It never indulges in easy emotional moments or in treating the audience like we're too stupid to understand it. The cast, including Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and the very underrated Forest Whitaker, is excellent, and the film makes you stop and think about how we take communication for granted and how difficult it could actually be if aliens were ever to actually pay us a visit to actually communicate with them. It is a very smart and challenging movie. Like much of Malick's work, and like most of Villeneuve's work, it is often flawed and imperfect. Yet Arrival, I think, is better than its flaws, and challenges us in a very interesting way. It's not a movie for everybody. But the fact that it does win over someone like me, who has never liked a Denis Villeneuve film before this, may give you a sense why you might want to watch it. I do recommend Arrival. In fact, I recommend it quite highly. It tries to be better than the usual fare in this genre. And in my opinion in succeeds more than it fails. This may seem like faint praise. But I mean it as very high praise indeed. Arrival is not like any other movie of its ilk that you are likely to see. It may not be for everyone, but it is more than worth the effort and the time to watch it and make up your mind about it yourself. Many of you should see Arrival. Not because it is perfect. But because it is not trying to be every other movie that you've ever seen. There is a famous story about two film critics being overheard as they cam out of a screening of Stanley Kubrick's 2001 when it was first released. One critic is said to have turned to the other and said ""I don't know if I've just seen the greatest movie ever made or if I should be asking for my money back."". Many movies since have tried to approach the high intelligence of Kubrick's great masterpiece. Arrival comes as close as any I've seen. For me that is the highest praise that I can give it. It's not 2001. But it comes close to being as enigmatic and as thought provoking. If you hated 2001, and many people do, don't go out and see Arrival. If you loved 2001 however, then Arrival may be about as close as you're going to get to a film that matches it. It doesn't quite get there. But the fact that it tries, the fact that it almost gets there, makes it worthy of attention. Not by everyone. But by those of us who want film to be more than mere entertainment. For those of us who like to be challenged and to be made to think, really think. Taken all in all, I think that Arrival is a great film. Don't go to see it if you're expecting anything like the many Star Wars sequels. But do see it if you want more than big explosions and catch phrases from a film. Do see Arrival if want more from a film than for it to be easy and obvious. And I do mean that as very high praise indeed."

There are many flaws in the film with the alien premise but that's really not what the movie is about, it's about humanity and perceptions of time and space, what's important, what decisions are made, were made, will be made, could have been made and their impact.You could compare it to Twilight Zone episode 'Walking Distance', if you could go backward or forward into time and change things, how would it propagate forward? or backward?

" Good sf, brilliant plot, some points to overthink
",0.7717,-0.9662,2017-04-16 00:00:00,9,"Very interesting nice realistic-like sf! Plot is brilliant, and I have to confess I actually did not understand it entirely after seeing and had to research IMDb for that.Again, it's about time circles: Louise's daughter dies of cancer and she has flashbacks a couple of years before; she already knows the private number of general Chang that he is going to give her in a distant future, along with the very words that will make him change his mind and saves the world a war, and in 3000 years the aliens will need our help, they know this already. (The good news: it seems we will still be around by that time).In some of the comments, Louise is accused of being selfish, because she knows what is going to happen to her daughter and still accepts to get pregnant. I understand the accusations, and I myself would do everything to cheat the inevitable and avoid a child. But: there's a thing about time circles, maybe she just couldn't avoid! After all, she became able to look in 4th dimension (time) and foresee future, but if there was no daughter this WASN'T the future. Like, if a paranormal gifted person tells me she sees me dying next day in crashing flight 241, so I cancel my ticket, she proved she is not para normally gifted because her viewing was incorrect.Has also to do with the question whether universe is deterministic; do we have a free will or are we just driven by a bunch of physical and chemical processes in our heads, so that future basically can be calculated? I don't know, but actually exactly because of these contradictions I do not believe that viewings in future are really possible (in distance, maybe yes).Minus point in the movie: it seems very improbable to me that there would happen such a strong rebellion in the US army in this critical situation, that authorities are disobeyed even getting to the point to enter advanced explosives into the space ship. This was probably added to avoid a lack of action in the movie and to have at least one explosion.The part where she suddenly can stand the aliens physical environment including gasses etc., when she is lifted up by a black shuttle and meets Costello, actually I'm not sure how to interprete this, it's unclear to me. Was this all in her head, was the contact brought by telepathy and suggestion? Meanwhile, Costello knew a lot more about humanity and her mind, so it's possible, but not sure."
" The additions to the original short story water down this scifi experience
",0.3182,0.9975,2017-04-16 00:00:00,6,"This is the first Denis Villeneuve film I've actually liked, and it gives me hope for the upcoming Blade Runner 2049, which is a sequel for the 1982 classic. It's based on a short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang, and the basic premise goes that twelve alien ships have arrived to Earth. Each has seemingly randomly chosen a spot on Earth to hover over and after a certain amount of time a door always opens, letting explorers in. The movie is told from the point of view of Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a world-class linguist, who's been tasked with communicating with the aliens.On many levels it is an extremely refreshing science fiction experience. It focuses heavily on the protocols of first contact and the difficulties of trying to communicate with a new civilization that's so removed from our own as to make the task almost impossible. That might sound boring to some, but the film is anything but. Insert some unforeseen twists and difficulties, which I shall not spoil here, and we have a more than decent story in our hands.It's also technically superb, as well as well-acted all around. The film looks absolutely fantastic, which has always been Villeneuve's strong suit, but in this he really pulled out all the stops. The first slow shot we get of the alien ship hovering above a misty valley is some of the finest visual cinema I've experienced in years. The whole film has this gritty realism applied to some pretty outlandish visuals and concepts, and it works beautifully. Also huge props for Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, playing the other scientist in charge of communications. Both are really talented actors, but the show absolutely goes to Adams.Where the film unfortunately loses me a bit is in the additions made to the original short story. There was some military presence in the original as well, but here it has been brought into the spotlight, which doesn't make the film any stronger. The original concept and the original themes were already strong enough. Throwing in some inept criticism against redneck armed forces and strong arm negotiation tactics only takes our focus away from the main idea. The plot also moves around pretty clunkily. For example, there's this general mentioned early on in the film, seemingly casually in the background, but each and every member in the audience could instantly tell that he was going to return to screw something up. The film is full of moments like this, which also takes away from the central idea by pulling on our suspension of disbelief.Nevertheless, despite its flaws, Arrival is a good scifi film. It had the potential to be a great one and there are definitely flashes of that greatness scattered throughout the film. Unfortunately the task of telling a coherent and structured story is where Villeneuve drops the ball a bit. Still very much worth a watch for all those looking for something new in the scifi genre."

Who was Hannah's father. In the future we are led to believe it will be/is Ian. I have nothing but praise for the actors who did their jobs well, they are, after all, only human. I understand about the linear time theme. For me, in some cases, as a writer of sci-fi, time is, always was, always will be, everything is happening (not happened) in the same nano-second. Get your head round that if you can. I found a couple of characters unnecessary, unproductive. It seems in the making of this film, a lot was left to 'use your imagination'. I needed to stretch mine quite a bit, and had to accept the 'sudden understanding' of deciphering the alien language, but the Abbot and Costello bit was lost on me. I felt the film was made in a hurry but the director took his time doing so. Could I have done better? With the same resources, yes. It would have been longer though."

And linking this idea to a personal life is just great. How does a human cope with the knowledge of all things to happen? In this case getting a child that tragically dies as a teenager. Would you go on living this life?Unfortunately these things unravel only at the end. The last 10 minutes of the film are convincing. But the 1:40 before that are uninspired to right out boring. The fantastic idea is superseded by the typical Hollywood stuff. Instead of telling us a convincing personal story, perhaps even with aliens, the filmmakers decided to drown almost everything in the usual line: military investigates, scientists are summoned under their command, earth governments consider an armed conflict. This is the source of suspense and drama. Missing completely the real point.This whole setup really buries most of the movie.It is a tragedy to see this beautiful idea wasted that thoroughly. Acting is great. Cinematography is spectacular at selected few moments but generally sub par. Music is fine."

I'm not exaggerating when I say I think Independence Day was more logical and consistent.It starts with Forrest playing a recording of a few seconds of noises and expecting Louise to somehow be able to translate it.Then, when there is the choice of linguists to take on the mission, Louise asks them to ask the other guy ""What the Sanskrit word for war is, and its translation?"". They apparently pick her on the basis that she answers correctly, and he does not.Let's go through the things wrong with this.Firstly, isn't (one) correct answer simply ""war"", by definition? Secondly, how do they know her answer is right, if only the most genius- y person knows the right answer? Thirdly, does he get to ask her a question? Fourthly, what does it prove anyway? It all only makes sense in movie- logic, where if person A is more genius than person B then B's knowledge and skills are a subset of A's. You may think I'm being pedantic over one small issue but the whole movie proceeds like that. I can give lots of examples: Forrest demanding to know why she's teaching the aliens such simple words -- when she had just got started -- what on earth did he expect? Ian proposing that maybe the reason for the difference in air pressure in the alien's chamber is because they are used to a different atmosphere -- apparently no-one had thought of this. Writing on a whiteboard being tried before photographs or drawing say, or even a computer display that would at least make her type consistent. The kangaroo speech (using a myth to explain, well nothing at all actually, just something that sounded smart enough to Forrest to shut him up). The bizarre actions of the Chinese and other countries. etc etc No-one on earth brings a single good idea to the table other than Louise and Ian (and he only plays a bit role).Then things get gradually more and more sappy and conclude with some 15 mins or so of flashbacks to / from her future life and daughter h a n n a h. I guess after interstellar people think this is a good way to finish a sci fi movie, but it erased any goodwill about the early part of the movie for me."

However, being a sci-fi fan I was pretty sure that 'Arrival' would be right up my street.It really wasn't.The most frustrating thing about this movie wasn't necessarily that it was awful, but that it takes a concept like first contact with an Alien civilisation, pretends to make a serious sci-fi flick and then basically fills the reel with fluff, incompetence, over-dramatisation, and apart from the main character, a load of incomprehensible, bumbling buffoons.I'm quite a fan of bad movies but I can't think of one that I've seen that made me want it to end with 45 minutes left.And here I was thinking that Interstellar was a load of tripe that would take some beating. Yet here comes another sci-fi flick that again pretends to be a lot deeper than it really is with customary nods here and there to 2001.Newsflash: 2001 was made in 68 and still kicks movies like Arrival and Interstellar mercilessly.No way does this awful flick deserve an 8.0.Edit Nov 2019: Just rewatched Arrival 2 and a half years later to see if I had it wrong the first time I watched it.

First off I am truly torn on whether this movie is even sci-fi in the first place. And I'll touch on that in a second. However, every sci-fi element in the movie is very, very poorly arranged and executed, and provide illogical, inadequate, or plain stupid answers.Now, the movie has sci-fi elements for sure, it's a given that the movie _HAS ALIENS_, be that as it may - in the form of squids. But this movie is very similar to Interstellar, in the sense that it uses this sci-fi theme as a backdrop for some ""larger-than-life"", humanistic, pseudo-inspiring idea. The movie tries very hard to depict a multitude of different ""awe-inspiring"" ideas, such as globalism and humanism, coupled with a plot that has more holes than swiss cheese. The end result is that the movie fails in everything it tries to do, in varying degrees.Now I said the movie is probably worth two stars, the additional star I'd be willing to give for the audio, which was apart from the protagonist's annoying panting (almost as bad as 2001), the only thing going for this movie."
" A pseud's film
",0.0,0.8939,2017-04-06 00:00:00,1,"This film is a complete failure. It leaps from one ludicrous affectation to another, straining for 'meaning' but having none. The director Denis Villeneuve can deal with reality, as witness his film SICARIO (2015, see my review). But when it comes to spacemen, forget it. He has not got a sci fi bone in his body, or should I say his brain, as the film has been made by somebody who is clearly bone-headed. He thinks he can achieve profundity by having lots of loud music which drowns out the actors' voices, by having them mumble and whisper, by most of the scenes being so dark you have to peer through the gloom (all the better to see nothing, my dear), by having one of those identikit Hollywood children who lisps like an infant and cannot speak clearly, by not really showing his aliens except through a haze, by pretending to be something of a philosopher, with all the assiduity of a drunk ranting in the street. Amy Adams plays the female lead, and she at least articulates her speech, even though she has been encouraged to say everything in a near-whisper, so that we struggle to make out what she is saying, especially against the 'mood music'. As for Forrest Whittaker, who spoke perfectly clearly in THE BUTLER (2013), he has been reduced to an incomprehensibly mumbling hulk. I think I more or less understood about half of his lines, or am I just being kind? The idea that he should play a tough Army colonel was a serious instance of miscasting. He looks too nice to bark out orders such as 'move out!' But we can't understand his dialogue anyway, so in the end it does not matter. The stock scenes of tanks and soldiers with assault rifles attempting to deal with incomprehensible aliens from another world shows that Hollywood has not moved on since the 1950s. Everyone in the film seems to wear battle fatigues. But what about the fatigue of us, the viewers? There seems to be no end to this meaningless rambling film as it wanders around seeking for answers and finding none. The camera lingers so obsessively on the face of Amy Adams that the film is essentially an Ode to Amy. She seems to be the subject of about half of the shots in the whole film. Was the director in love with her? What is that all about anyway? Amy's leading man is played by Jeremy Renner, who get almost no close shots, much less closeups, and seems to have been cast in order to play the thankless role of a nonentity who would not steal too much attention from Amy. OK, OK, so the film was made in Canada, and Villeneuve is Canadian, and maybe it is not technically a Hollywood product. In which case, it is simply worse than Hollywood. All Canadian aliens should hang their tentacles in shame. A single scientific buzzword has been thrown into the dialogue, 'nonlinear'. That is all the science we get. (Nonlinear equations are increasingly important in modern physics. Don't even ask what they are, this is a film review.) There are mumbling remarks about the puzzling nature of time, but even on the rare occasions when we can hear them, they don't make any sense. Somehow Amy Adams is meant to know the future, or is it the past? It is not clear at all what she knows, although we are told she speaks Farsi, Mandarin, and many other languages. But no matter how many languages you can speak, if you have nothing to say, you might as well keep your mouth shut. Having the aliens look like octopuses is sensible, since serious writers on extraterrestrial life have been suggesting such creatures since the 1960s at least. Octopuses have big brains, and so hyper-intelligent super-octopoid aliens probably do exist on many worlds. That at least was not nonsense. But just about everything else was. And once again China is misconceived as being run by a general called 'Chairman of the People's Army'. Come on, folks, can't you get anything right? But the most ludicrous single thing in the entire film is the suggestion that a spaceship lands in the Sudan, of all places, and we are expected to imagine that the Sudan has a proper government. Hahahahaha."
" Arrival of a great and refreshing alien movie.
",0.6249,0.9864,2017-04-05 00:00:00,9,"After movies like Prisoners,Sicario and now Arrival we can put Denis Villeneuve to the arrival of the great directors club. He can make a unique atmosphere to a movie that makes you stuck to the screen from beginning to end. Now this is what happens in the case of Arrival. We have a great story, not the usual alien invasion movie genre, here we have an alien race that try's to communicate with humanity. Linguistic professor Louise Banks(Amy Adams)with the help off Ian Donnelly(Jeremy Renner)try to solve this mystery. The first appearances of the Heptapods is super amazing, the atmosphere is great, the communication methods of the creatures are quite impressive.Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer created a fully functioning, visual, alien language. Heisserer, Vermette and their teams managed to create a ""logogram bible,"" which included over a hundred different completely operative logo-grams, seventy-one of which are actually featured in the movie.﻿Amy Adams is great as the lead actor, in big pictures her story is the prior story of the movie in my opinion, makes you think about much more then a movie, makes you think about life and the time that is given to it."
" I'll explain this movie for you...
",0.0,-0.9754,2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"I am amazed by the amount of people calling this movie a boring and insane film. Actually, this sums up one of the things the thriller talks about us being slow brains and dumb. I think that must be the case of the majority happy people who don't need to have his/her gears working too hard. Life is simple, huh.This contain strong spoilers, but this is for those who did not understand the movie and genuinely want to.THE ""FLASHBACKS"". ----------------- The apparent flashbacks you see in the beginning of the movie are neither flashbacks nor flash-forwards she's having at that moment. The movie just shows you the future and tricks you into thinking she is thinking about her past. But those thoughts and her are still disconnected. Only the watcher will see that there is this connection and the watcher places this events in the past, as the movies intends to. In the now, she does not give any clue about mourning. She doesn't seem very happy at into the now, but actually it has nothing to do with the future yet.WHO IS THIS GIRL I KEEP SEEING? ------------------------------- By the middle of the film, you notice that as soon she is into the mission and approaching the Aliens, she is starting to feel weird and have the flashes. She is opened up to communicate, and she then start to have the actual flash-forwards, because the aliens start this process. Up to this point, the ""flash-backs"" we were tricked into thinking they were this, were not happening to her. But now they start. And it gets stronger inside her while mission carries on. When she definitely meets the alien inside its dome, she now is given a gift to see the future. She uses that future information to give humanity a fate in that particular situation (with Chinese leader) and she knows fully now that the girl is her future child that will die from cancer.MARRIAGE FALLING APART ---------------------- She learns within the process of knowing the future, that her husband will leave her, because she will reveal too soon that the child is going to die from cancer. The guy, apparently a strongly firm steady and centered guy in the action, is actually a emotionally fragile and weak parent. With her passing the knowledge to him that she will eventually die, he can't cope it with the reality, and leaves the family when the girl is around 7 years old. (Although we have seen that the girl will actually die in her late teen years). So the husband, the guy, doesn't accept the loss, and moves on selfishly - even when the event is already years ahead. A weak and emotional broken party.HER EMBRACING OF THE FACTS -------------------------- So when the aliens go away, Dr. Louise is now fully aware of the future. That she will have written a best selling book, that she will have worldly recognition of her work. But she ultimately makes a choice: She will not change anything. She has loved the child already, she know the girl will have cancer, she accepts it. She doesn't prevent anything from happening. The only part that we are not told is that, when she makes a decision to inform her now husband that she knows the future and the child will die, it is considered a mistake she have had done, but certainly she doesn't know yet on how this will develop - thus it will be a ""mistake"" on her part. Nevertheless, she won't change anything. Also, she is not aware of 100% of things in the future (that is why she makes this single mistake).This movie is about love and loss and human beings. It has nothing to do with aliens that much. It's a movie that will help us understand how tiny and insignificant our mediocre lives are, and what we think is under our control, it is actually not. This movie is on par with Butterfly Effect (1) and Inception. Interstellar breaks too many physics rules to be considered a better movie, but Interstellar is in fact much of a block buster, with massive physics mistakes (there is no way one can survive being sucked by an even-horizon).Well, I hope you reconsider this film. Watch again and see what a masterpiece it is. Get your gears going faster and you will understand.Cheers."

'Arrival' is very well made with some strong acting performances, as you would expect. However, there's nothing in this film that blew me away, nothing spectacular and as far as I'm concerned, nothing to justify the many glowing reviews it has received.Sci-Fi is a tricky genre to master and 'Arrival' certainly gave it a good shot.

" HALF of the best sci fi movie of 2016
",0.6369,0.9451,2017-03-30 00:00:00,9,"This was advertised as the ""best sci-fi movie of the year"". We have maybe, half of the best sci-fi movie of the year.Arrival promised from the trailer an amazing alien landing film, with the leads of Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams watching them. We expect from this, action, horror, violence and world domination. We got something much different. It was a chance well taken, pulling alien sci-fi out of the tropes it has been left to rot in. There were a lot of different routes it could have taken and this one was well chosen, Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners – 2013; Sicario – 2015) definitely made the right choice. However, my issues with this film, lie within the cinematography. The shaky camera frames, the silent soundtrack, the hearing everything as Louise heard it as things were happening were all extremely disorientating. The film could have been made a lot better without these things, and with less experimental techniques to make the film unique – the plot alone was unique enough. The plot of this film, as before said, was amazing. Humans teaching aliens their language, and vice versa. It was highly unique, and showed great techniques.The unfortunate thing about this film was that it didn't kick off until an hour and ten minutes into the film. It was a total let down and a shame. However, it was a heavy trudge through to get to the action in the film.It was a shame, truly, that this film was advertised so big and for it to be such a let down in the first half, and it's only being rated a six out of ten."

" Amicable and thought provoking yet ultimately negligible
",-0.2023,0.9732,2017-03-30 00:00:00,6,"Dennis Villeneuve's newest picture Arrival has been advertised and for the most part received by audiences as an original and thought provoking sci-fi akin to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Interstellar, but I have to say after watching it I feel slightly underwhelmed by the work of a director who to date has never made a film short of brilliant.Arrival begins with a dozen UFO's 'arriving' on Earth at various locations. Your typical science fiction tropes are all present, with a seemingly mundane day interrupted by potential chaos as Louise Banks (Amy Adams) a college professor in linguistics suddenly becomes a sought after commodity by US intelligence in order to decipher an alien language. Together with Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), she eventually learns the alien language enabling her to perceive time in cyclical fashion due to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. This of course is the first misinterpretation of scientific theory within the film, as the real theory: even being mentioned in the film as a debunked concept, is dependent upon an initial language perception, for example a natural speaking English person will not learn French and suddenly have a theoretical/ mental capacity on equal terms with a natural speaking national. The initial perception garnered by the first language absorbed generates an individual's perception. So it seems implausible that her perception of inter- dimensional time could be altered so drastically, if at all. Which brings me to my second point, in that her new language is incomprehensible, and I don't mean in the general way that anything above the third dimension is incomprehensible, but in a way that is contradictory to theory cited within the story itself. Through learning the aliens written language, Louise is imbued with this new inter-dimensional vernacular enabling her to observe time from beginning to end instantly and freely as she congruently experiences her entire life at any given time as if she has done it before; because in effect, she has. The film shows and infers multiple instances with juxtaposing scenarios of happiness and sadness, with the prime example obviously being the birth and death of her daughter. This consequence of her power is portrayed in the film as a sort of Amor Fati (love of fate) or as Nietzsche conceptualised, an 'eternal recurrence' where one simply accepts their fate through contentment. But this theory is ultimately flawed within the context of this film and in turn with the structure of this films 'bootstrap paradox' narrative, instead choosing to portray Louise as a sort of Deus Ex Machina/ McGuffin who conveniently learns of things she has already done within cyclical time the very instant it becomes relevant to the linear dimension. There are multiple instances of the plot moving forward due to Louise's perception of the 'future'; for example, her phone call to General Shang was only able to occur because it had already occurred in the future, creating a causality loop where one action is dependent upon another in order to fulfil itself. Putting aside the fact that she seems unsure of herself at the time of the phone call, receiving her 'vision' of a conversation with the General in real-time suggests that her perception of time was still in fact linear, when if she was indeed able to perceive time in omnipotent fashion she would not have been so confused by any scenario having already experienced it retroactively. The mere presence of a causality loop denotes another scientific theory touched on in the film called Fermat's principle, where a ray of light will always transverse a distance that consumes the least amount of time irrespective of distance and refraction. The significance of this principle infers that in order for the light to take the least amount of time, it theoretically must 'know' how long each possible angle will take to transverse, in effect, knowing the future. This indicates that the path is set, and therefore predetermined. The consequences of this outcome with relation to Louise perceiving time in totality, essentially means that she has no free-will. If she has already experienced all of her time simultaneously, then she inevitably must fulfil what she has done in cyclical time in linear function as well. Therefore even if she does not occupy time in linear fashion, she still interacts within the third dimension linearly resulting in the fulfilment of the 'future' being enacted just as she had initially seen it.Arrival does showcase great acting and traditional sci-fi elements throughout, but the overall rhetoric within the film, presaging an absolute need for open and honest communication across linguistic barriers is a nice sentiment, but ultimately negligible. The film finishes with a touching sequence of memories flooding through Louise's head of both past and future as she is presented with a cross roads; does she divert from this presented future and into the unknown? Or does she engage in a relationship with Ian Donnelly that will result in her future occurring the same way despite this realities afflictions, because it has moments of true beauty; is it no worth it? The trouble is she never had any choice to begin with as Villeneuve has compromised real scientific reasoning and logic in order to facilitate 'Hollywood' moments of tension and climax which contradict an abstraction of time that lends itself to omnipotence.I enjoyed Arrival. It might not seem like it after reading this review, but it did have moments of excellence; and Dennis Villeneuve's style, although not quite as dark and gritty as in previous films the likes of Enemy or Prisoners, is still evident and as always striking. The main pitfalls of this film lie in its execution of narrative, which contradicts its implied meaning with its factual telling resulting in an ultimately frugal piece that although thought provoking, is just kind of a mess."

With a phenomenal performance by Amy Adams the movie takes you through an engaging story about love, sacrifice and time itself. The Sci-Fi part of the film is only a small part of an even greater theme. The soundtrack by Johann Johannsson is also very well composed, including the violin piece by Max Ritcher, on the nature of daylight. Denis Villeneuve once again proves himself as an excellent director and writer. A must see film, regardless of how much you like Sci-Fi."

" A hole ridden plot stretched too thin
",0.0,0.8622,2017-03-29 00:00:00,4,"I had several problems with this film, but I think the biggest was something I found out from someone who loved it - it was based on a short story. Yep, not enough plot to stretch out for a two hour movie. To say the pace is a little slow is an understatement of the highest order - things move so slowly in some spots as to make glaciers look at their speedometer to see if they are speeding. This explains all the long silences, the endless scenes of people looking off into the distance maybe at the shell (what they call the alien spacecraft - why, never explained like so much of this movie).However, there are some good parts to the movie. The CGI is really well done, the aliens themselves are fairly well conceived - I would have liked it if they actually floated and perhaps came from a gas-giant environment but this is sort of spoiled by one scene. I thought the alien language wasn't too bad. It was different enough from Earth languages to seem alien - although again later when it is revealed to have a 'spoken form' that the heroine somehow understands the shine is somehow taken off.The second biggest problem I have with the film is the premise that our heroine can look into the future because she immersed herself in the language. This led to a second plot that is essentially a mother-daughter story which didn't interest me in the slightest. I swear, I would have found a documentary on toe fungus of greater interest. To make this worse, this whole story is intersperse throughout the whole film - it starts with a 10 minute montage of this story.Finally it is presumed that she shares this concept of looking forward and back in time with others and while she doesn't change things in her life, what about her students? Really? Wouldn't at least one of them, try to change a mark they got in class, or stop their mother from being hit by a car, or hell, going all Groundhog Day and changing their approach to a girl they really like until they get it right. There is a saying, ""to know the future is to change it,"" and I will swear to all I consider holy that if I'd known this film would be like this, I wouldn't have watched it."
" Not for everyone
",0.0,0.9948,2017-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Let me start with: I hope that many, many SF fans love this movie so that we see mind blowing, thought provoking blockbusters like this more often. But the movie is not for everyone. If you are not familiar with concepts of dimensions, if you cannot bear a movie without action, you won't be a happy consumer. If you appreciate movies for being unique, if you love slow movies which live and breathe with their atmosphere and characters and if you just like SF and science, you are going to love this one. The next part contains heavy spoilers so don't read on if you have not seen the movie yet. The final reveal is mind blowing in its truest meaning of the word. So get ready, fasten your seat belt and watch this one. I have read many one star reviews and they all boil down to: I hate the flashbacks, time moves too fast, things do not happen in a correct order. Well, this is the big catch of the movie. That time as we perceive it, is perceived in another way. Time is a concept that we have. In reality, it is a dimension. There are theories that everything is available at this very moment. But we perceive it in a flowing way, because we cannot grasp reality in another way. To understand this concept, let us look a level lower, at a 2D scenario. If there are creatures that live in 2D only, how would they perceive a 3D structure? Imagine they live in the page of a book. They could only understand a body as a flow of 1000 pages. Each page would look like one photo of a CT scan. And only all 1000 pages together would form a 3D structure. We perceive time the same way. Only our 1000 pages of a book are 1000 seconds or 1000 years. But it might very well be a possibility, that everything is present at all times, we just cannot grasp it that way. In the movie, Louise starts to break this barrier. Time stops being represented by a flow, but Louise can see all events at the same time. She does not need 1000 CT scans to see a body, she can see it right away as a whole. This is the reason why she sees flashbacks of a daughter that does not even exist. Or why the question of having a baby seems to come so early in the relationship. Because there is no ""late"" or ""early"" or ""future"" or ""past"" for Louise any more. And if you understand this, you can feel the beauty of this movie with full force. Even though there is so much pain for her, she still accepts the flow of time as we understand it. She still wants to have her daughter even though she knows that she will die early because of disease. And even though she knows that her husband will leave her, she accepts his love in the first place. Because it is not about the destination, it is about the journey.I hope I could help a little to make you see this movie as I see it. A beautiful masterpiece that makes you a better person in the end."

" ""So Hannah this is where your story Begins""
",0.0,0.999,2017-03-28 00:00:00,9,"A proper grown up Science Fiction film this but i can appreciate it won't be for everyone.Different to 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' Fans of 2001 A Space Odyssey might notice a few nods to that film...The gloved hand making contact with the ship = the group of astronauts touching the monolith on the Moon and the Monolith shaped window separating us from them.This film headed in a direction not expected with the 'TIME' element but it added to a most unusual & brilliantly grown up SF story.This species had figured out 'TIME' (to some degree) and were offering it to us by way of a gift after mastering their language this would give us the ability to perceive TIME as they do and would enable us to see the future.This 'gift' (perhaps a curse to some?) is put to great use by the first to master it LOUISE (the truly awesome Amy Adams) who uses it to change the Chinese General's mind by way of seeing her own future and getting his personal phone number (from him) & telling him the words spoken to him by his wife on the day she dies.In so doing he calls off any aggressive action and offers everything discovered about them to all the other nations around the World (IT'S A GOOD THOUGHT isn't it?) in so doing the crisis is averted.Why the 12 ships? it was a plot device but also a nice LITTLE message to all of us around the world, each ship had different piece of information we ALL needed to put together by way of CO-OPERERATING with each other (if ONLY! HUMANS huh!) The special effects are especially well done & the alien creatures (Abbott & Costello) are cleverly filmed, they do not look anything like those squid types, oh no, these are MAGNIFICENT, IMPRESSIVE & BIG creatures.My sister and i had a long conversation over this one...It should create debate among you too (Time, Aliens, What to do when they finally show themselves to the World? CAN'T BE TOO LONG NOW RIGHT? most of us know they're out there & possibly closer than you think, although they have probably known about us since DAY 1) My sister thought Ian was also the father of Louise's 1st child but I am fairly certain he wasn't, yes they gave her the gift of perceiving time but she did not know him before meeting him for the first time on that helicopter? right? I found it interesting that Louise was shown a time in her future showing her this unknown 2nd child but then seeing this 2nd daughter? look up to her and ask ""why her father had left them?"" Louise responds by saying it's because SHE made the wrong decision, implying that he (Ian) her father had left because she did not inform him that she was carrying this rare genetic decease that killed her 1st child & it seemed had been passed to this 2nd one who's fate it was also to be.That's how i saw it and if so then how very SAD. I guess that's life & people make strange choices at times (me included) we do NOT see Ian when time is flashed forward to Louise being celebrated & introduced to the Chinese General so by this time he has one would assume already left? only some 18 months into the future.A HERO Woman (she does possibly SAVE the WORLD) in film is still a SCARCE thing but a flawed one is even more rare! and a BOLD way to go and unlike 'Enchanted' another wonderful Amy Adams film there is no real HAPPY EVER AFTER here for her.""So Hannah this is where your story begins...and despite knowing where it leads i embrace it, but i don't now believe in beginnings & endings""So is THIS is her way of making this choice of having a 2nd baby? if it is her 2nd child? (TIME TRAVEL huh! perhaps there is no correct or wrong way just a WAY!) although to see one's child eventually suffer somewhere along the time frame is a choice i find difficult to comprehend but is a BOLD way to go? unless I have got it very wrong?The Whitehouse Spokesperson here say ""We have a protocol for a scenario like this"" YES i don't doubt it...Time is closing ;)It is a sombre (some might even say depressing) looking film with the dark colours but this is why it felt so different and the soundtrack only adds to this feeling with what seemed like whale or dolphin sound signatures? a way of communicating.It has a couple of messages & they're VERY GOOD ONE's i think...WE NEED TO LEARN TO GET ON WITH EACH OTHER (perhaps before we can get on with any new alien species) sadly for me I don't see this happening any time as we still have a lot to learn, we are but babies still.We need to TREASURE & REMEMBER THOSE MOMEMENTS IN TIME that bring happiness, joy, enlightenment & even excitement to us all at times in our lives, these might only be glimpsing for some of us (sadly) but HOLD ONTO THEM DEAR (if at all possible) for they are WHAT MAKES US.It is a Terrific & Thought provoking picture & one i LOVED.AMY ADAMS knocked it out of the park with her performance here.BLADE RUNNER 2049 in GOOD HANDS."

" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.8477,2017-03-28 00:00:00,3,"Seemed intriguing at first. I was curious about how the linguist would interpret the alien method of communication. No dice. We are given images of her gazing at the computer screen at the alien symbols without the benefit of translation. Miraculously, she is able to turn circular blobs into English sentences.There is a lot of jumping back and forth from present to past to present again and, in the end, what's assumed to occur in a chronological order, has occurred in a different sequence from what the audience is led to believe. The last quarter of the movie is rather confusing in this regard. The military operation at the site of the U.S. alien ship is poorly managed. Our civilian heroine manages to thwart global disaster by calling the Chinese general on a sat phone she confiscated from a CIA operative on the post. A significant keynote in the movie, yet we are deprived of the contents of the conversation. I won't even get into how she manages to steal the phone, call the private number of the general, speak Mandarin to him, and in that one sentence, convince him to halt his aggression toward the alien ship. Really? A lot of assumptions are made in order to forward the plot, but it doesn't work since the content is devoid of answers. Disappointing."

And I've not even come to the entirely unrelatable Amy Adams, who bonds more with the alien than Renner, but still somehow ends up with him.Totally missable movie. Another example of Hollywood taking an excellent concept (circular time) and just making a very shitty movie out of it."
" Not what you would expect, perhaps
",0.0,0.9696,2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"First things first. This isn't really a sci-fi film. It is more of a drama, set against a sci-fi backdrop. I think this has lead to the movies unfortunate handful of poor reviews. Some expected explosions and punching, and instead got a thought provoking, calmly paced drama, with some interesting science behind it.The cinematography is beautiful throughout. Everything shot in a cold twilight grey. It adds to the mood of foreboding throughout the entire film. Likewise the score is great. A sometimes creepy, sometimes beautiful, almost alien soundtrack, which obviously fits perfectly.As for the plot. It seems many found it hard to understand and as a result, found the movie boring. I personally can't understand this, as it is in fact quite straightforward, but I won't spoil it by dissecting it in the review. If you were able to follow interstellar (another great sci-fi drama) then you will have no issues with this.Ultimately, it's about your expectations and tastes, as to whether you will enjoy this or not. If you go into it, expecting or wanting gun battles and explosions, then you will be sorely disappointed. If you go into it, expecting a slowly paced, emotional and clever sci- fi/drama , then you will probably enjoy this great movie. It is moving, touching, menacing and thought-provoking and a great break from the usual running and screaming sci-fi that gets churned out so often."
" excellent example of 'aim for utopia' sci-fi
",0.5719,0.9988,2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Remember Abyss? Where the benevolent - but still threatening - aliens showed the human race that war was futile and we wept at the (cut in some versions) montage of awful things that the human race was capable of? Arrival was similar without being so dramatic.Amy Adams lead the film well. In all honesty she carried the film as the other characters (other than her daughter) didn't really have much of a look in. It was interesting seeing Forrest Whittaker play very much the second fiddle, although he played it very much to type. Other characters were more or less obsolete, with the exception of a few nagging mozzies flying around to provide a little tension and the necessary conflict, much of which was - like a mozzie - just in need of a sharp slap. She was excellent as Linguist Louise, very understated and sedate albeit a a little too ""monotone"" and ""internal."" The whole film was a little laid back, never quite enough tension to feel any real threat, and the characters other than Amy weren't deep enough to really care about. That said, Jeremy Renner was nice, but it was never really explained exactly what his purpose was, or rather what input he achieved, in terms of the First Contact, and was in a subsidiary role to Louise.That all said, I loved the film and I really enjoyed how it weaved the convergent narratives neatly and beautifully and kept you guessing. I wasn't surprised by the twist, and had suspected as much, noticed the little clues, but it was still really well achieved. The story was clever, simple (premise) yet intelligently brought to the screen. I think the quietness brought a strength to the simplicity but I think there wasn't enough emotion or variety of activity to make the film truly epic; not enough tension in the international political scene, or from the aliens themselves. The teaching/learning scenes were cut too short/too staccato and too much was implied and glossed over, it was if the editor was too heavy handed and trying to go for intrigue, just omitted some of the plot. There was too much process that I felt needed to be put back in, not for explanation (the plot was clear) but for interest. The learning of the language, went from ""my name is..."" to sentences without actually showing the process - it needed a little delineation, more explanation of the circles, as I was interested.Mention must be made of the SFX - reminiscent of Independence Day - and faultless. The aliens ""Abbott"" and ""Costello"" were excellent; their mode of communication beautiful and the real first contact was really quite special. The (for wont of a better word) 'space ships' that the heptopods arrived in were beautiful too and some of the best SFX were their departure and their existence and presence on the screen with helicopters/ships etc, and the gravity scenes were well done.Overall a watchable, beautiful and intelligent film, and whilst on the surface it seems perfect, and I don't need linear story lines or over-explanation of things, and it did what it was meant to do in terms of storytelling, I feel that it was missing something, the profundity of gripping emotion and heart-pounding tension. It had more scope but just fell a little short. Less is more, and I like how that is generally employed here, going against the grain of Hollywood overkill, and also how America weren't perfect, and China (the great Tzi Ma) were the heroes and leaders of the conclusion (with Louise of course). An awesome experience of cinematography that I would recommend."
" Sci fi chick flick

If this scenario were to ever unfold in the real world, I seriously doubt that the military's response would be so calm, controlled and slow.The concept is great. The problem is that it was laid out in a slow, vague and tedious manner. The flashbacks were annoying. The idea of taking what would be mankind's greatest adventure and turning it into a slow moving drama with a weepy female lead is very disappointing. She failed to demonstrate the obvious courage needed in this kind if scenario.In short, I'm glad I didn't blow $30 at the theater. But, even then, I'm not happy that I wasted $4.00 on pay per view."
" 'Arrival' is a masterpiece—it was, it is, and it will be.
",0.0,0.9732,2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"'Arrival' is a masterpiece—it was, it is, and it will be. This film balances the alien sci-fi element with its motifs of unity and balance. The language of the aliens shows the power of balance. We see balance between individuals (e.g.: Ian and Louise), balance between countries, and balance between the sciences (e.g.: numerical methods and linguistics). These balanced converge on the main thesis: a balanced worldview, in which we make decisions seeing the end from the beginning. This movie involved me on a deep emotional level, and makes me want to be a better person. But on to the technical side. The pacing was excellent—it keeps the viewer involved throughout. The accurate linguistics and scientific analysis delighted me. The governmental decisions were understandable, though often frustrating (this was deliberate—I was grateful for the point they were making). The visual effects were well done and not overbearing. The use of time was clever and enjoyable, reflecting the theme well. I wholly recommend this film to everyone."

It's more about a woman's love for her daughter than it is about the aliens.Cerebral, slow-paced and lacking in thrills, explosions, and chase scenes, it's target audience is adults (women?). Your stereotypical tween and teen males will find it boring.Some aspects of it were cringe worthy, other aspects were enjoyable, lovely and intelligent. The sci-fi aspect goes beyond aliens and into the realm of, if I'm not mistaken, the fabric of space and time.Overall I liked it and will even praise the cringe worthy parts for a good effort."

" A poorly executed and cliché-ridden disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.9072,2017-03-25 00:00:00,2,"Like many, I enjoy a good sci-fi yarn - serious or light - I'm not bothered, but the one thing that is required is either a belief in the story (CE3K) or total disbelief (Mars Attacks) - Unfortunately, this movie takes itself so seriously, but delivers so poorly, that it becomes unintentionally laughable. I will summarise where I feel this movie went so wrong.WARNING: SPOILERSWhich army would waste an army General's time in flying to a linguist's house rather than sending a less senior operative? You can not expect any linguist to listen to a 15 second series of alien grunts and moans on a Dictaphone and expect them to immediately translate them. The UFOs are revealed too early to build any anticipation. Louise meets her future husband on the army camp - where his job as a physicist is to do no physics, but to interpret some alien language (which should be her role) - otherwise he just follows her back and forth into the ship saying nothing. In CE3K the concept of communication was explored through universal physical consistencies: light, sound, movement. Writing Arabic letters on a baby white board with a marker pen would be meaningless to an alien, just as someone writing Chinese letters would not be understood by another human that doesn't speak the language. It is also expected that the aliens presumably aren't confused by the fact that the UFOs in China/Russia etc will be seeing different alphabets. For Louise to assume the aliens have names just because they squirt when she says ""Louise"" or ""Ian"" is laughable for the USA's best linguist. Humanity's first experience of superior intelligent life is handled entirely by the military in a field in Montana. In CE3K, the military were present - only to keep the public away - the bosses were the government civilian project team as it should, and would be. When the news announcer proclaims that China is going to attack the ships, and that Russia and Sudan are following suit, I nearly choked on my tea, Sudan! Sudan? Hmmm, let's see -which countries in the world don't we like right now? The use of political propaganda in these Hollywood movies is just too painful. Besides,... Sudan? Attacking a spaceship over 1500 ft tall with no knowledge of its defence/weapons systems? Has Sudan even got an army worth the name? How about South Sudan or Assad? The aliens want the humans help in 3000 years - yet they travelled to 2017 when we have no technology to even understand their request... and could possibly forget about it in 3000 years - that's if the aliens had even bothered to convey what that help might be!etc...Overall this movie was a shower...it knew what it wanted to say, but couldn't work out how to say it. Life imitating art in this case."

",0.0,0.9433,2017-03-24 00:00:00,2,"Yes, I know I know - everyone loved this movie. Except me. Here is why.This movie is perfectly described by one of it's scenes: Amy Adams and a crew of scientists approach the giant alien shard (we've been waiting for them to enter this spaceship for about forty long minutes). They approach, they enter, we wait.... and it cuts to them AFTER THEY TALK TO THE ALIENS. That scene describes everything I feel about this film: waiting and waiting for something remotely interesting to happen, and then right when that life-changing moment is supposed to happen - it doesn't. Arrival simply falls short.Arrival is boring. That is the most simple way I can put it. It really tries to be interesting; we watch and wait as Amy Adams attempts to recreate the Miracle Worker with misty ink shooting octopus creatures playing the role of Helen Keller. We trod along as this ""brilliant"" team of scientists hold up cue cards to the most dull race of aliens to ever exist. ""Wow! Now we know how they say the words ""Swiss Cheese"" with their wobbly ink designs! We're learning so much!"" Meanwhile you sit in the theater, wanting to scream in the faces of the creators and actors of this film, ""We don't care! Please dear Lord, something happen! Please!"" However, your cries do not help you as you endure yet another round of deep mouth breathing from Amy Adams and a screechier version of the score from ""Pacific Rim"". The simple retort from people who LOVE this movie is, ""You probably just didn't get it."" Here's the thing: I got it. The problem is, after two hours of pure torture - the movie has a CRAAAZZAAYYY TWIISSTTT WHHOOAAAHHH! There are two major problems with the ""twist"": Firstly, the elements that the twist introduce poke so many holes in the story that it drove me insane sitting in the theater. Second off, by the time the twist is introduced - you don't care because you've just been sitting here watching alien translators for two whole hours - GAH!Arrival tried to have an ""Inception effect"" on people. The creators wanted the viewers of this film to leave with their minds blown. What they forgot, is Inception had very awe inspiring plot twists and features AND was highly entertaining. Not only that, but in all honesty - the twist in this movie makes little to no sense. And yes - I UNDERSTAND THE TWIST, it just isn't a good one.What I can sum this review up with was my reaction (in theaters) to when Jeremey Renner literally said the words, ""Let's make a baby."" I laughed out loud. The funniest part: those words were the most interesting of the entire film. This movie tries too hard. It isn't deep or revolutionary. It is simply a bore."

It was outstanding and explained a variety concept in an interesting way. Story which is adapted from a short story was mind blowing because of its story structure. Script had interesting elements in it and it was narrated in a non-linear pattern which sometimes might complicate the entire film but superb direction saved it.2.)Amy Adams and Jeremy - Amy is the central protagonist and she acted well without any flaws. In short she was a showstealer and she succeeded in portraying her character. Jeremy didn't have any challenging role but he was one of the main characters and did his part well.3.) Background score- Outstanding and marvelous background score. Its one of the main component of the movie and it really helps the narration to get feel. Viewers are able to feel the characters only because of its soothing background score. I am happy that it got nominated but it should have won because it deserves it.4.)Vfx and cinematography- Vfx was too good and it helped in giving mind blowing visuals on screen. Cinematography was equally good.5.)Variety Sci-Fi movie Negatives- 1.) Complicated narration- Narration was complicated at it will take time for people to understand. Only after discussing you will realize the entire plot clearly because it was too complicated and they could have reduced its complicated narration.Overall- To sum it up its one of the best Sci-Fi movie i have ever seen. It took me time to digest the whole plot but then after sometime i understood everything. Those who say bad about this movie might not have understood its concept. So don't judge this movie so fast as it can affect others enjoyment. So arrival was special to me and i really enjoyed it.My rating- 5/5 (excellent)"

",0.0,0.984,2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"""Arrival"" is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whitaker, and when alien spacecrafts touch down on Earth, Louise, played by Amy Adams, is asked by the US government to interpret and understand why and what they are doing here.Don't go into ""Arrival"" expecting crazy action scenes and explosions. Though this is an alien invasion movie, it is a film that is grounded and winds up being a character study. We learn a lot about Amy Adams as a character (No bathtub scenes in this one). we learn about her troubled past, and we see how she acts when she feels the government starts to take too much control. She did a fantastic job in these scenes, and the entire cast did a very good job as well. Tension in this film is very well presented. Though there are no action scenes, you feel as if the aliens could attack at any second, or the humans could attack at any second. It is very well realized. Almost any time a human enters the alien spacecraft it is presented in a way in which you feel like something bad is going to happen, and I really give the film props for that.This movie is so well shot and well directed. Denis Villeneuve keeps proving himself as a director. Each shot in this film has a purpose. They way certain scenes are shot really help to ratchet up this tension that is presented in these scenes as well. The creature designs did kind of bother me but it's only a small nitpick. The aliens look like giant squids. That's basically all I can say about them.Now let's talk about the third act of the film. The third act of the film really makes you question the entire thing. There's a big revelation at the end, a plot twist in other words, and it really makes you wonder. There are some things that are glossed over in this third act, as it seemed a bit more focused on trying to be clever and smart, which it was. But this twist just seemed to come out of left field. It definitely didn't hinder the movie. It's a twist that makes you think long and hard. I have had multiple discussions with co-workers who have seen the film and some of them can't even figure out what the film was about. It's a film you really have to study, and this third act may detract some viewers. If there are people who don't really like sci-fi and are watching this film and then the twist happens, they may not understand it. I think it's a twist left open for many interpretations, and the film does a good job of selling that, but really doesn't answer some of the other questions it presents in its first two-thirds that you may have had. There were definitely some things that could have been explored more.I am going to give ""Arrival"" a 9.2/10"

" as metaphysical and analytical as the mysteries of the universe
",0.0,0.7652,2017-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Arrival is a very odd name for this movie, since so much of the movie does not focus on the ""arrival"" of the aliens, yet communicating with them. Perhaps what it refers to is the arrival of truth at the film's end. The aliens in the picture constantly try to communicate with the humans, and we live this process via Amy Adams's language expert. We don't really try and talk to them on our own, as everything is a response to an actions the aliens perform (almost as if they had this planned out?). This is how a director of the movie, Denis Villeneuve, communicates his language to the audience and this journey is an arrival of a movie that is aware of cinema's past and its future.Everything in Arrival is fluid and expertly done, from the brilliant camera work to the pulsating score to the merging of several timelines which effortlessly tell a story. In a lot of ways, Arrival is the perfection and culmination of the extra-terrestrial sci fi movies of the 21st century so far: from District 9 to Prometheus to Interstellar, we have somehow gotten here and it makes us stop and reanalyze it all. There is little action in the movie, an explosion is shoehorned in during a subplot in the middle and there is media coverage footage showing how different countries react to what they assume is a threat. But it all connects to the current events of the times, as our inability to communicate with China or Russia may lead to disaster because people get scared when they do not understand something as simple as language and perceive anything or anyone different then themselves as a threat or an alien.Arrival presents us with many ideas, the most powerful being what is the connection between time and language? The alien's language in Arrival, revealed as a symbol of circular fluid, is a metaphor for the circle of the plot of the film itself. There are so many mediocre alien invasion movies over the last fifty years of movie making that Arrival is like a masterclass in how to do it right: accessible to the mainstream movie going public and as metaphysical and analytical as the mysteries of the universe. There are many unanswered questions that thrill the mind rather than frustrate and so many places where the movie could have faltered but it never does. This may be Amy Adams best cinematic performance yet but acting itself is almost made irrelevant throughout the course of the movie that it is easy to overlook; this movie immerses the viewer in an alien spaceship and makes one reexamine their entire existence. Arrival simply does the best job of communicating and illustrating its point then any other movie of the year."

A good Sci-Fi movie makes you doubt and question about yourself and the world surrounding you. When I heard about Arrival and all the positive feedbacks and reviews it received, my expectations were relatively high. I then watched the movie with a certain fear, the fear of being disappointed by all of this hype. Well I can say that the movie was not only up to my expectations, it went way above it.The main story is fairly simple, twelve alien ships arrive in different part of the world. Nobody knows why. The whole movie plot resolve around the quest of communication between the aliens and humans. The main character is a linguist teacher named Louise Banks who lost her daughter prematurely because of cancer. The army request her help to develop a communication method with the aliens.The idea of aliens showing up on our beloved earth is already known by the public, in most of the cases the aliens appear as hostile creatures whose only purpose is the destruction of the human race. Arrival on the other hand focus on the language barrier and the conflict it creates among the humans; how can we communicate with them without accidentally starting a war? The movie shows how limited and close minded our vision of language and time comprehension is, the aliens are not only here to enlightened the humans but the viewers themselves. The language barrier is as problematic with the aliens as it is with the humans and the various interpretations they deduce.I was really amazed by the meeting sequence with the aliens, the right use of light and background music made the scene genuinely disarming, i couldn't stop thinking about «Encounter of the third kind», there is an echo between these two movies and the way they treat the human- aliens meeting. As a viewer mystery quickly substitute fear and you ended up being as curious as the protagonist.From a purely technical point of view the movie is visually appealing, it's nothing revolutionary but it certainly good enough not to break the immersion. The most noticeable element was probably the editing and how coherent it is with the ending. The actor's play is also on the point, however the character's archetype seems a bit too linear and predictable in my opinion. I was a bit disappointed by the soundtrack, usually science fictions movies from this category tends to leave remarkable music that you will remember long after seeing the movie. It's unfortunately not the case here, it does the job but it's far from being a masterpiece.In conclusion i highly recommend Arrival if you are a Science Fiction enthusiastic, it is without a doubt one of the best movie of 2016. It's a fresh sci-fi movie and a good surprise. Even if you are not a huge fan of sci-fi it's still has a strong and very well written story on it's side and i advice you to give it a try."

",0.3818,0.9812,2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Expert on language Louise Banks (Amy Adams) retrieved by the authorities after a number of extraterrestrial craft lands around the Earth. Creatures are trying to communicate something, but nobody understands what. Louise must try to find out if they are peaceful or hostile before time runs out. Just time is important in this movie, and if you are looking for lots of action, this is not the movie for you. The film is careful and slow. Amy Adams is good as it somewhat strange and pensive language expert, who must cope with a major challenge. The film's strength is in my opinion a new twist in this genre. The weakness is that it sometimes becomes somewhat tedious. We would like something to happen. There is also a minus that in this film also pulled into the military engaging in an boring manner. The film has a strong and surprise ending. But overall this is a good sci-fi drama, and well worth seeing."
" Really great and then......

It was a good ""smart"" sci-fi movie as another reviewer put it, however, what dropped the rating to a 6 and made it mediocre was the fact that it had a build up and then just puttered out. It leveled itself and really never came to a climax.I got that ""That's it?!?! Seriously?!?! Well, that was lame."" at the ending so that dropped it at least 2.5 stars.Sort of like most M. Night Shyamalan's movies. A build up of anticipation and then just fizzes out."

It had it's moments, but unfortunately it was mostly undone by it's slow plodding story. the 'twist' was interesting, but was morally a bit 'iffy' and that also was a turn off in the end which made you kinda dislike the main character as she comes across as pretty selfish when you think about it. Plus the reasons for the aliens being there, please, how weak was that. We are here to help you, (which they kinda didn't). But in return you must help us in 300 years? Help with what? and why if they are so advanced do they make us spend months learning their stupid language. Was it just to make everyone work together? It led us to brink of war for goodness sake, what if the main character hadn't figured it all out....then what? It was just to much faith and wishy-washy working together crap for me to take what the film makers were selling seriously. It was beautiful shot though."

" Not as clever as many reviews make it out to be
",-0.357,0.5129,2017-03-19 00:00:00,7,"I have to admit, I was a little bit disappointed with this movie. This was touted as one of the best and most intelligent sci-fi movies of the year, and it didn't quite live up to all that praise. It's not a bad movie though. The acting is solid, the directing, sound design and visuals are really good. But the story is kind of bland. For a movie that is all about communication, I thought it was a little bit odd that the most obvious way of communication (pictures) was completely ignored. The movie also depicts Russia and China as paranoid villains, while America of course saves the day. In light of history, this is hard to believe. It is also very difficult to believe that China, a country whose alphabet is literally a bunch of pictures, would not try to communicate with pictures, and instead is presented as the aggressor against the aliens. In the end, the climax of the movie is basically one big Deux Ex Machina, and that is a tough pill to swallow. Could they not have thought of a resolution that was a little bit more clever, and not the equivalent of pulling a rabbit out of a hat? The whole movie is about communication, so shouldn't the movie end with a break through in communication? So while this is not a bad movie, it's not a very good sci-fi movie. It needed a better script."
" Beautiful story

And that Aliens have a non-linear time line, which only benefited the main character. Recommend this movie to anyone with Insomnia, great cure.

" Pure science fiction
",0.0,0.128,2017-03-17 00:00:00,9,Arrival is pure science fiction in the vein of Arthur C Clark. You will love this movie if you are looking for your preconceptions to be challenged and altered via the story. You will hate it if you are looking for an action movie like Star Wars or Independence Day. This movie is about making you think of other ways of being and perceiving the world and does an excellent job of it. No spoilers cuz pure sci fi cannot abide them.
" Entertaining but by no means a masterpiece
",0.7003,0.9515,2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Arrival has a very intriguing premise, great cinematography, and a performance by Amy Adams that should have garnered Oscar consideration.However, it is by no means the masterpiece some are painting it to be. This is not the ""thinking man's"" philosophical movie that some ascribe it to be. The conflicts in the movie are face value and do not carry much moral weight. Yes, the movie hints at the idea of determinism, but it does not flesh this concept out whatsoever.In regards to the movie itself, Arrival has a very interesting and unique premise. Through beginning the movie with that essentially happens at the end a circular progression of events is created to parallel the circular language and depiction of time that is so frequently stressed in the movie. The musical scores are quite good as are the effects and the views. From this alone, the movie is passable to sit through.The greatest sin of this movie is its unfulfilled potential. The plot is not very well fleshed out. Any true conflicts within the movie are extremely base and unrealistic. The main threat is the compulsiveness of China and Russia, a common movie trope here in the states. Future threats to mankind and the alien race are alluded to but not explained. Twelve alien ships came with a ""gift"". The gift is the language the aliens speak that allows you to see time. However, this is seemingly only passed onto and fully understood by Louise, leaving a lot to be desired. Furthermore, there is no real character development for anyone besides Louise, the linguistics professor played by Amy Adams. The next closest character to gaining any substance is Ian, a physicist played by Jeremy Renner, who in the end only serves as a glorified narrator.Overall, it is an entertaining movie but certainly not Villeneuve's ""mangum opus"" as some are calling it. His work with Prisoners was much more complete as a movie."
" Still not sure what I watched
",-0.2411,-0.867,2017-03-16 00:00:00,2,"Had it not been for Amy Adams, would not have given any stars. She is still a phenomenal actress but this was a bad choice for her. It had no substance for even a basic sci-fi film. The other Arrival with Sheen was cheesy but still a better film. Sorry was very disappointed after the hype."
" Borrows themes, but stands on its own in the end.
",0.0,0.7717,2017-03-15 00:00:00,10,"Arrival shares a lot of themes with Contact, one of my favorite films in its genre. I spent much of the film waiting for it to find a way to set itself apart, and boy did it ever. The pacing is intentionally slow, which I believe serves to put the viewer in the same anxious state the characters are living in.The process of decryption and communication is handled believably - it seems a number of 1-star reviewers don't understand basic tenets of linguistics (not that I can blame them). Using building blocks to establish understanding is crucial, and takes time - time that the viewer feels in a very real way.The film's conclusion is poignant, satisfying, and well set up without being obvious. I feel sorry for those reviewers who said they left early - they missed a stunning conclusion to a wonderfully told story. I might suggest that they grab a copy of Battle: Los Angeles from their local thrift shop (or garbage dump)...it's probably more their speed."
" Arrival scrambles human perception of time and language
",0.0,0.2263,2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,Arrival scrambles human perception of time and language. The whole idea is conveyed in very first scene and showed it towards the end. It may be very alien for people who are so bound to the time. The complexity of language translation is also explored. Worth to watch by scientist who learn semantics and maybe someday make computers understand how human thinks.
" Re-watch more than once

How can someone vote an 8 for this stupid s**t? Beware of such people. I mean the last transformer was better than this ( at least that s**t had a story)!"
" Interesting Twist to Old Story
",0.4019,-0.8277,2017-03-14 00:00:00,6,"First let me comment on this review board in that so many reviews are all or nothing. Reviews should be somewhere between 1 and 10, not 1 or 10. You can basically discount 1 or 2, and 9 or 10 as just people enamored or disappointed with the film.With that said, I gave it the 6 because the story was a hazy hodgepodge of M Night Shyamalan proportions. If you are expecting a sci-fi thriller look elsewhere, but if you're expecting an old, well worn story of.. well I don't even know what it's really saying to be quite honest. In one scene the story seems to be that she is remembering her daughter yet in another she is back in the present. Only later to you learn that she has the ability to see the future, so she never really had a daughter but she knows she will, that the little girl will have an incurable disease and from there the decision she has to make is whether or not to have the child anyhow. Since she remembers it, it stands to reason that she did have the child, only in the future, if that makes any sense. I suppose her memory isn't as much a memory as a view into the future, and at one point she learns to actually realize when she's there vs in our present time. Now for the aliens and the soldiers and such: What? These could have been anything it made no sense to have things that couldn't communicate. For something with a universal language, why couldn't they communicate with humans? If these things were from the future, they already know they came there and should be able to do what she did, which was to lean on those precognition as a learning/manipulation tool. That's just one hole in many in this movie. The soldiers were a hoot! Half of them walking around outdoors without their covers (hats) with the big brass all over, seemingly unconcerned as long as a couple of them wore battle gear (for what?) while the rest were in standard issue uniforms. I also found it interesting that the trucks were washed down as if the unmeasured radiation could be washed off, or that some foreign bacteria might eat everyone alive.Now on to the plot: If aliens who had that technology wanted to kill you, would they wait months while you talked with them before doing so? What, are they going to beat you at Scrabble? Why is it always some other country that's eager to go to war instead of the USA? Isn't the USA the country that's almost always at war somewhere in the world? But no, Russia and China ready to do battle because if China says so, Russia is on board, and never mind they killed their linguist because that's what Russia would do. Just what the world needs, a universal language so we can all hate each other openly. But somehow it brought all the countries together albeit still proud of their own individual national flags. Generals and high ranking colonels shoot first, ask questions later however for some reason the military was the ones who decided to attempt to communicate. Who was the 1st person to go up into that open hole? Did they go without weapons? Why? Why even go up into it in the first place? Why not sent a drone? Don't you just love movies that use deus ex machina to get across these gaps in reality?Overall the movie was entertaining, but poorly done and it's really really easy to dismiss it as a chick flick, since most of the ""science"" was hogwash."

I know that we have a universe that gets bent, but it seems too much like a god machine to me. She is hurt be the death of her daughter so we throw in a metaphysical curve to explain the intentions of an alien race. So Einstein is alive and well, but we need something more than this.

Amy Adams is stellar throughout and she really carries the film. The concept is intriguing and thought provoking and I enjoyed it, but I was left with a few ""why"" questions so I needed to watch parts of the film again. Some people have said they had some problem following the ending of the film and that is their fault. The film makes very clear what has happened. However if you remember the beginning, that's where your confusion will come. They surprise us by using nefarious tactics to ensure that we are surprised by the film's end. Considering how strong the topics of this film are, it's a shame they copped out with tricky story telling to add to our suspense, especially considering how suspenseful the story is. It's not smart sci-fi as a result and it should have been"

Fear is quickly taking hold of many people, some of whom have the power to start a war with the alien visitors. If the ""Arrival"" of the aliens is meant to bring peace and friendship to humans, then it must be quickly confirmed before itchy trigger fingers causes an intergalactic war.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Arrival"" is the scene when the aliens are introduced. Let's just say if I was there, I'd either run screaming like a Wayans brother or start crying like Matt Damon.""Arrival"" moves slowly, methodically, allowing the audience to soak in everything they hear and see. Although many characters are in this movie, almost all of the focus is on Adams and Renner, making ""Arrival"" feel more personal. The flashback sequences of Adams and her daughter adds a dreamy but highly relevant layer to the story which gives a nice surprise twist near the end of the movie.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Not your average alien movie - But something more amazing and intriguing
",0.7677,0.9663,2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"I can see a lot of negative reviews for this movie and therefore I though that I need to review this title as well.I believe the people posting the negative reviews came here looking for an alien sci-fi movie which it absolutely isn't. Sure, this movie has aliens but do not expect it to be like any other alien movie you have ever seen.Instead the movie focuses on abstract concepts, concepts of time, memory etc etc. The pace of the movie is a bit slow, but it will keep you thinking and wondering and imagining. In this regard, I find it more similar to Interstellar. The way these concepts are portrayed is quite intriguing and I am sure I will be deep in thought over these concepts for many more days.Apart from this the movie also has a very subtle but deep message. It is definitely a very well thought story and I loved the way it has put that message across.Finally, needless to say the acting and direction is pretty spot on. So fire up your brains and go watch this movie, and wonder about the possibilities. It is definitely worth it."

I do think toy story 2 had more hype to live up too after the spectacular toy story 1 but it fell way short. Luckily the trilogy was recovered after the splendid toy story 3 so the franchise is still holy but Arrival is one good movie. I think the protagonist are very similar because like Louise i believe woody lost a child too and that's why hes so protective of Andy. There really is no villain in Arrival but the villain in toy story 2 was the old prospector guy and i really didn't like him so that point goes to arrival.

" Brilliant movie with a few loopholes
",0.5859,0.9205,2017-03-11 00:00:00,8,"SPOILERWhat initially was supposed to be a linguistics based movie, turned to be a thought experiment (with shaky foundations of course, since it is a thought experiment!) about non-linear time! The entire movie is based on, arguably an extreme exaggeration of the sapir-whorf-hypothesis about the linguistic relativity (The way language affects our perception of the world). So essentially it is also about emotion and what it means to live if we already experienced time, both the past and the future! Somewhat like Eidetic memory(not a good comparison but somehow came into mind). When I first saw it, I was disappointed with the ending and thought that it was so random Time-travel stuff at the end. After pondering upon it for a while, I understood that it was a thought experiment trying to interpret what it means to experience something. Questions remain but still a brilliant thought experiment.A few things were impractical like just having 2 scientists and a bunch of soldiers headed by a captain deciding almost everything and also plenty of time-paradoxes but still a very interesting thought experiment. The struggles to understand the language initially was also pretty good, and different from a lot of other old alien movies, where we just fight the aliens from the get-go!"
" Breathtaking
",0.4588,0.9959,2017-03-11 00:00:00,8,"Oh man, this one was so good. Better than expected, for me, and I had high hopes to begin with. It was adapted by screenwriter Eric Heisserer from Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of Your Life"". Since its release it has grossed more than $196 million worldwide and been nominated for (and won) multiple awards, which is no surprise at all. It is as cerebral as it is fantastic, all the while dealing with some very relevant and sobering flaws of the human race and politics in general. It manages to be heartbreaking, mystifying, and chilling, with strong characters and a plot that makes you ponder long after the credits roll.** SPOILERS! **The most interesting thing to me about this movie is how much the tension between our countries is more worrisome than the mystery of why these aliens are here in the first place. We — with our finger always hovering over the trigger — are a much greater threat than any outside source could be, and yet we're always using that other finger to point the blame. The vagueness of the aliens' arrival is enough to raise the hair on the back of your neck, but it's nothing compared to what we ourselves are capable of. The reactions that people have to the aliens' arrival — rioting, looting, self-immolation, calls for initiating violence — seem so natural for the state of our culture today that it's nauseating. And the miscommunication between countries and leaders — the feeling that we're just involved in a big game of telephone — is exasperating.The film does an amazing job of making the alien ships as epic as possible — they are these looming leviathans, hovering over the ground effortlessly despite their massive size. They are both terrifying and awe-inspiring, and the swiftness of their silent arrival only adds to the dread. And yet when we see the aliens themselves — these floating, almost delicate, sea creature-esque beings that are quickly dubbed as ""heptapods"" for their seven limbs — I felt nothing but awe and curiosity. The interactions between Louise and the beings is just almost spiritual, in a way. There's a deep connection and seeing her commitment, her full force of dedication to understand them, is beautiful. You almost feel jealous in a way of her privilege of getting to know an entirely new species.The language aspect alone is enough to keep you deeply invested in the plot. Watching someone decipher ANY foreign language is interesting enough to me, but when that language is being burst forth in a swirling, inky smoke from the starfish-like limbs of an unknown alien species, I am 100% sold. Louise comes to find that they do not communicate verbally, but rather in these complex, circular symbols that actually are sentences with no structural beginning or end. Absolutely fascinating.The flashbacks to Louise's life with her daughter — and her daughter's untimely death — are absolutely heart-wrenching. They are understated and yet pack such a powerful, emotional punch. There's a scene where Louise holds her hand up to the invisible barrier between herself and one of the aliens holding one of its 7 hands up and during their moment of connection there's this sudden and intense flashback to Louise holding her baby daughter's hand and it had me instantly in tears.The special effects were used smartly — not to overwhelm or show off, but to add a punch where it was needed. When the aliens push them out of the ship when the bomb was about to go off is one amazing example, and when Louise goes up into the ship alone and is almost suspended in liquid, hair swirling around her, in slow motion fascination while she learns about their true reason for coming to Earth so good.And their reason is just mind-blowing. They are coming to Earth to give humans the gift of their language, which will allow them to change their perception of time. They know that they will need the help of humans in 3,000 years, so they have come to help us now. We realize that Louise's ""flashbacks"" are actually her visions of the future, her being able to see the life she will share with Ian (who she is just now meeting), and the tragedy they will experience with the death of their daughter (which will result in them splitting up when Ian finds out she had knowledge of the daughter's death all along).This shifted perception of time is what allows Louise to save the entire project — when China decides to give the aliens an ultimatum after it is believed that the aliens have threatened warfare, Louise is the one who is able to see into the future and know what she needs to do to get them to back down and listen to her interpretation of the aliens' message. The tension while she pieces together these snippets and evades her superiors to accomplish this is awesome.The majority of the score — composed by Jóhan Jóhannsson — is a wonderfully done addition to the movie, but I am mostly partial to Max Richter's one included piece, ""On the Nature of Daylight"", which has actually been used in quite a few films but is a brilliantly haunting piece of music all on its own (we've had Richter's album, The Blue Notebooks, on repeat in our house for years now).I feel like I could go on and on here, but really one of the most fascinating, sobering, awe-inspiring movies I've seen in a while. Highly recommended."
" Brilliant!
",0.6239,0.4606,2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,The movie requires an intelligence slightly above average to understand the plot involving the aliens which becomes secondary at the end when it reveals a touching human story and a quite human dilemma. Sci-Fi are plausible and don't offend science laws drastically and the ending brings a whole meaning to the story.

I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies, have ALL Star trek collections ( all of them ), star wars, and I collect all sci-fi movies. This here is a joke. Aliens come to earth, they can see the future, but somehow they need mankind in 3000 years. Despite knowing all this, they are so dummy that they cannot learn a simple language, and it takes months to teach simple words to humans in a drawing form. The complete movie is a BS, a terrible waste of time, money, a pretentious movie, they try to make a deep thing like ""2001 a space odyssey"", a movie to think, but all this stuff is simply to reveal a complete failure in the story, logic and everything. A bunch of actors inside a small plastic cabin, soldiers with no apparent reason plant a bomb inside the alien spacecraft ( They are so idiots, if an alien race comes to earth, they are far superior in technology ). Yet, soldiers shot the spacecraft with bullets.!!! OMG...I have to stop here. I lost 2 hours of my life watching this S-H-I-T."

Yes the movie moves and unfolds very slowly, but it has to to make you feel the weird, stark-eyed fascinated uneasiness of the characters as they come face to face with these beings. I am not even sure there is a word or words that describes what that must feel like, but the movie makes you feel it anyway. Everything else in between is well done as well, the dream sequences with Louise and her child, the tension between her and the government types, the fascination and eureka moments as she begins to unlock their language and their reason for being here.

Etc... I can see the director tried to make this movie as a shocking and emotional revealing process but failed in the most unfortunate and pathetic way.

I still have no idea. In a way Arrival reminded me of Interstellar - a smart sci-fi flick with strong family drama woven in, and I liked that part of it. I also enjoyed that it commented more on the human race than focusing solely on aliens. I thought the twist in the end put a lot of things in perspective, and offered the viewer a chance to consider fate and choices. I also enjoy dabbling with linguistics, so a movie where I can basically nerd out for two hours is always welcome.What I didn't like is the weak reasoning behind alien presence. Honestly, the question that Amy Adams kept asking them, What is your purpose, never really got a satisfactory answer. There are many crucial points that are left unexplained to the viewer, ie the scene with the Chinese general. Some of the messages in the movie, especially the one about ""working together"" were too cheesy for my tastes. The romance, and that was a bit turn off for me, was unfounded and inorganically introduced. We were sort of expected to believe that it happened, but no actual build up was created by the writers or the director.Overall, an average for me."

I regret to say that I have terribly wasted my time watching this fatuous film.In general, several things are extremely not right: 1. This film should not be classified under the genre Science Fiction. It should be place under ""DRAMA"" 2. The screen play lacks logic. I believe that the person who wrote it doesn't have very wide knowledge of how high and far Science Fiction genre has grown for expectations. The writer should have known that Sci-Fi fans and followers are intelligent. 3. The film rapidly change its focus. It jumps on the girl, then the invasion, then the something else, then the military, then some politics, then some personal drama... everything is wrong with that script because to me, it doesn't have one normal and complete story line among the above mentioned. If I could, I would rate it -1."

Plus, throw in some great actors I respect in Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forrest Whittaker... and I thought this was a slam dunk.It was far from it. Boring, slow, no real point or plot.

If you want a thought provoking film, then this film is for you. It makes you think about how important communication is and when confronted with an unknown, is it the best policy to work with the unknown or against it."
" Disappointing and deceptive
",-0.4939,0.9326,2017-03-08 00:00:00,5,"I went in really wanting to like this film since I love sci-fi and i'm interested in philosophy of language. However, I was disappointed, mainly because it fails at its own game: the science is ridiculous, and so is its cheesy and simplistic anti-war message. The scene where the colonel first approaches the protagonist Louise Banks at her office was incredibly stupid and badly written: Colonel: (out of the blue) It's been only two days Louise: (confused)... C: People are already demanding answers. Here, listen to this *plays audio recorder*L: (still confused) C: Well? Come on! What are they saying? L: I'd have to be there; I can't translate from this. C: You did it back then with Farsi insurgents!! L: That's because I already knew the language (Duh!) C: Ooohh, I see what you're trying to do here you sly girl... it's not gonna happen, this is not a negotiation!! (storms out) WTF!And then they land a helicopter in her backyard to pick her up (so over the top!) after they find out that the second ""expert"" on their list gives an ""incorrect"" answer to a question that doesn't make sense: ""what's the Sanskrit word for 'war' and its translation?"" Isn't that asking the same thing twice? In any case, this was a clumsy way of introducing the theme of miscommunication. Apparently this Berkeley scholar was not aware that a word can have different meanings in different contexts/uses.Louise is the only real character in this film; they decided to make everyone stupid and hollow just so she could look smart and layered. She's written to be more a translator between two known languages than a linguist. They really didn't know how to show a true linguist at work, so they decided to skim through the whole deciphering process by means of a montage rather than showing her actual process, which would have been far more interesting. You could say this is a film that only features sci-fi elements as a backdrop for a drama. Well, they should have advertised it as what it is! Renner' character doesn't behave like a scientist, he's quite ignorant and shallow (but we're supposed to think he's smart because he scribbled some unintelligible stuff on the whiteboard). The only contribution he makes is incredibly contrived and unnecessary. He's there for two reasons: 1) to give presence to natural science, providing a counterpoint to Louise who represents the social sciences, 2) a plot device for the twist ending/love interest (by the way, who bought them falling in love? Nothing throughout the movie hints at a developing relationship. The ending was so cheesy).Then the military is a bag of clichés: stupid, impatient, and reckless. And since when a colonel and a general make all the political decisions? The whole ""let's unite and cooperate"" message falls flat because it was so unrealistic. The right-wing nut-jobs sub-plot felt rushed and unnecessary. It's like they're trying too hard to take a political stance against everything that Trump represents, but it comes off really heavy-handed.I'm not even going to bother with time ""travel"" paradoxes and contradictions about the presence/absence of free will, because I get that this is sci-fi and the plot is supposed to serve a greater message, in this case, the moral question that Nietzsche famously once posed:""What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sight and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence' [] If this thought gained possession of you, it would change you as you are or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing: 'Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?' would lie upon your actions as the heaviest weight. Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?""There were far better ways of exploring this question. As for the cinematography, it was unnecessarily bleak, and the only memorable piece of the score is not even original; it was written by Max Richter years ago for another film and recycled here."

This movie is slow, dull, dragged out and forgetful. I gave it a 4 only because it was filmed at all. I assume that those who gave it an 8 or more do not watch a lot of movies because I just can't justify the high scores with anything else. Oh yea.

If you want guns, explosives and mass destruction of cities this film won't give it. It's not your typical alien flick, I do admit i went into it expecting those things and spent the majority of the first hour waiting for the laser to appear, waiting for the main scientist guy to suddenly have skills with a gun that is just unfeasible in the real world, for someone with no training; but you know what, that moment never came and I thank the writers for that. Because I sat down expecting another dull action film to while away the afternoon and instead I got a beautifully made piece of cinematic mastery. This film isn't in line with the stuff that comes out of the box office nowadays, its leagues above it and to be honest it would sit more comfortably next to the type of cinema that you get at the Sundance festival and it's counterparts. I'll say again, if your looking for some gun toting aliens and a beautiful girl playing damsel in distress, look elsewhere, this film won't give it. But if you want to see one of the most thought provoking films to come out of popular modern cinema look no further because this film really makes you think about what may actually happen if aliens did come to earth, if you ignore all the stuff about time and mystic languages."

As the story unfolds, you suddenly realise you've seen this story before a thousand times. It's a classic tale - Sciency character introduced. Military are arrogant military people who don't science. They need Sciency character to science for them as they don't science. Aside from the obvious insult to the extremely talented people who do make up these militaries, the audience also feel slightly insulted that they're being taken for the same ride again. It's like you left the TV on for too long and David from Independence Day has just cracked the Alien Code that the military men couldn't solve. But the main storyline is enthralling. The sounds used in the film are masterfully done, and they almost, almost, get over the problems that the side stories have set up. A whole wonderful cast of misfired roles (Including a Forest Whitaker who has been given the direction prompt 'Be unreasonably unlikable') tar almost all of these main story scenes, in particular the ones which include the background military crew. You just can't get over the feeling that these people are stood in a green screen room, chatting amongst themselves about their weekends between takes. The gravity is just never there. Then, the film goes off the rails. A clever idea - poorly executed. Like a toddler telling you how clever they are, the film shouts and shouts and runs in circles, dropping all-capital-letter SUBTLE hints for the last 10minutes to make sure you work it all out before the main characters do so you can feel smart. All in all, it's worth watching. If this was the 90s it would be a great film. But it just isn't the 90s."

Arrival opened with some the strongest cinematography of the season, (mainly because ominous fog is my aesthetic) and I was a believer. I believed in the tension and even the potential reality of close encounters. I was all in, up until the main reveal, which to me seemed ridiculous due to the sheer magnitude of the twist. Even in comparison to some other crazy futuristic sci-fi plots.

" an interesting thought experiment
",0.4019,0.9978,2017-03-07 00:00:00,7,"I really liked this movie, but more as a thought experiment than as straight science fiction. If I had one criticism of the film it would be that it sort of changes tone in the last act from a ""hard"" sci-fi to more of a fantasy, leaving part of me wishing they had seen the original theme thru to the end.Both themes are well done enough that I enjoyed the film despite any incongruities I perceived. I should mention that I turned the spoiler tag on just to be safe, but I'm going to try and be a little vague anyway because I don't want to spoil a few big reveals that come together at the end of the film.The basic plot: the world is stunned when twelve alien craft suddenly descend to earth and throw open their doors. As society begins to buckle a bit under the strain of this historic event, a talented professor of linguistics who had previously worked with the government as a translator is selected to join the US team attempting to establish communication with the aliens.This first act is probably my favorite part of the movie. The alien physiology and method of communicating is very well designed, which gives a definite ""this could really happen"" vibe that is very engaging.Likewise, the challenges and methods used by the team to try and understand an alien species that shares very little in common with us was fascinating. In a lesser film it would be easy to have the protagonists ""realize"" that they needed some trivial concept to communicate while the rest of the cast looks on in awe (e.g. ""We just needed to realize that for the aliens, all of their conversation is done as stories!""). The reaction of the other characters is used to lead the audience to the idea that the protagonists are really smart, even if what they did isn't particularly brilliant. It's a common technique used by lazy writers to develop a sense of genius on screen when they don't really have any actual genius ideas to offer.As the film progresses, a dangerous situation develops between the nations that has to do with each nations motivations and fears. And again it feels realistic and engaging as it unfolds, although here is where the fantasy ideas about to be revealed start to create some plot holes.Without directly revealing any plot points, let me just make a couple of points about things that movies do that invariably create plot holes only solvable by ""magic"". The first is about anything having to do with traveling into the past or getting a book of horse race winners from the future or any other kind of ""information from the future"" scenario.The basic problem here is that these situations always create paradoxes. If my crystal ball tells me that in five minutes some guy is going to punch me in the face I will invariably change my actions to avoid getting punched. But in doing so, I invalidate the ""future"" I saw. Information is, quite literally, energy, and by adding energy I am changing the conditions leading to the future and hence, the future. So knowing the future changes the past which changes the future which changes the past and so on. Movies that feature time travel have no choice but to gloss over this to keep the plot from becoming a confusing mess, and in so doing break with ""realistic"" story telling.The second point I want to make is with what psychologists call magical thinking. This is where you make a mistaken connection between cause and affect, usually because you wish it were true. As in, ""if I go stand by the fridge my team always makes the field goal!"" Unless it's an X-men installment or whatever, movies don't usually have these plot elements in ""realistic"" movies because the writers know people will spot it and call them on it.But there is an exception to this, which is when a writer takes a true piece of information and marries it to an unrelated but seemingly connected idea. Then the true fact becomes the justification for the made up thing. So for example, it's a proved fact that forcing yourself to smile even if you don't feel happy tricks the brain into actually feeling happier, something having to do with muscle memory or whatever. But if I tell you that and then tell you that learning to smile all the time can cure you of ever being depressed again, that is pure BS. The two ideas *seem* related, so knowing that the first one is true might let you believe the second one is too, but they're not and it isn't. The movie has a pretty big whopper in this category related to the true fact that immersing yourself in a foreign language actually changes the way you think.""Arrival"" sticks to the idea of ""What would happen if aliens landed on earth tomorrow?"" pretty well, and makes a stab at showing how people might react. In the last act it uses some of the issues I mentioned above to veer away from this into ""What if space wizards gave us magic?"" territory, but really only so that they could wrap up the plot and ask some interesting philosophical questions on their way out. Bottom line, I really enjoyed the film. I just think I might have enjoyed it a little more as a straight sci-fi flick than as a fantasy piece."
" ""Arrival"": A ""Little Green Men Land on Earth"" Saga for the Thoughtful
",0.3818,-0.0478,2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"""Arrival"" is the story of a global alien invasion. Though this is far from the familiar fodder of ""our planet is in peril from intergalactic creatures intending malice and mayhem"". Instead, Director Denis Villeneuve (""Sicario"") has fashioned an intriguingly different approach, one of a foreign force from the far reaches of outer space whose primary intent seems to lie in occupying and manipulating the human mind and soul.And while it is about 25 or 30 minutes too long, the dialogue is often muddled (not counting that of the giant intruders) and several of the scenes are so dark it is a real struggle to distinguish what exactly is happening, I found ""Arrival"" to be a mostly creditable use of nigh on two hours of my earthly existence.Amy Adams (""Nocturnal Animals"") is quite good here as Louise Banks, a linguistics expert who is charged by the U.S. military with the monumental task of attempting to ascertain what it is that these who have trespassed against us are efforting to communicate. What she ends up learning will profoundly change her life. This discovery is viewed almost as a blessing in the context of the narrative. However I, perhaps like you, can only consider the ""gift"" that these space travelers have bestowed upon Ms. Banks to be nothing other than what I daresay it would represent to the balance of us.An insidious curse."
" Yes, language is a science too!
",0.4574,0.9802,2017-03-06 00:00:00,10,"My perspective on this movie is that it is more humanistic than it is about aliens. Yes, the subject is the aliens coming to the earth and we want to try to configure why they come here. What are their purposes? What can we deal with them? How can they understand us and most importantly, how can we understand them.But... that's not the focal point here. It is more about humanity. Our values and how can we act when things pressure us. We always fear of the unknown, we defense first before we get to open, we rather fight first than we want to communicate to each other. The different nations that take different course of actions toward the 'alien invasion' really speak to how we live in this world. Most people like the easy way to deal with things but not everyone dares to take the highest roads/risks.Amy Adams performs her character so divine. I don't think other actress can replace her character here as Dr. Louise Banks. The way she struggles with her health due to brain 'rewiring' and episodic memories that seems to be so real that she tries hard to maintain her ground.This is the kind of movies that you'll discuss for hours or maybe for years. Everyone has their own interpretation on this. But my interpretation is that the alien come just to give clue that they may need help from human in 3000 years later. Dr. Banks asked ""How would you know about the future?"" and the Hannah, the child character, is the child that she'll have in the future as she asked to the alien ""Who is this child?"" and later she knows that she and Ian is the parent to the child. Basically, the alien invasion event is the start of Louise and Ian and their child soon to be dead, Hannah. And she knows this from her communication with the alien. Then at the end of the movie, the aliens around the world just vanished, now they get their message across and understood by one human named Dr. Louise Banks. Later all humanity will understand this, yes, it'll takes just one person that can change the world.Now, I must say that the writers of this movie, Eric Heisserer and Ted Chiang, are sheer brilliance! This movie is just stunning at its film making, the camera works, the sounds, and everything is just bona fide EXCELLENT to me!"
" Arrival; Great Science Fiction.

The film isn't really a hard science fiction film per-say, but it does explore the importance of language; Amy Adams' Louise Banks embodies this importance and the film covers her story and her constant flashbacks of her late daughter. And these flashbacks are actually important to the conclusion of the story.Louise Banks is brought along by the US Government to communicate with the UFO's inhabitants: these arachnid-like aliens who speak a language that reads both forwards and backwards; they speak a language that transcends all of Earth's tongues and it actually reads time and space. These aliens provide some answers for Louise's struggle as a mother losing her child. It's revealed that because she learns the language by the end of the story that she actually saw the future, and thus it seemed like these 'memories' kept seeping into her thoughts. She hasn't had her daughter yet, she isn't even married yet; and her ability to see the future prevents China's leader from retaliating against the alien threat, thus resolving the story's big problem.Arrival is clever, and while its overall story may not make logical sense it is nevertheless a smart and thought-provoking piece on the importance of language to human culture.P.S. It's a shame Adams didn't get so much as an Oscar nomination for her performance. Real shame."
" not talking equals drama
",0.0,-0.7089,2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"A lot of shows and movies make characters unusually stupid or mean to create a dynamic between characters. This one uses the not talking method whereby people are desperate for someone to speak and then they just don't. The scene could easily be drama free if people communicated like normal human beings. I think Amy Adams stares into the distance blankly for about half an hour total while people madly scramble about in the background. It's such a lazy way to make a moment intense or a character look deep. The coolest stuff - communicating with the aliens, they repeatedly cut the scenes short. And of course people take up arms against the completely non-violent aliens because of the weird way they communicate gets people confused as to their intentions. If someone you don't know comes up to you and says 'weapon' you don't immediately pull out a shotgun and blow their head off. You say 'what are you talking about?'

This is why she offers to the observers the thoughtful question of: ""if you could view your life as an image, a story told in one nonlinear and infinite symbol, would you change it?"" But be careful, because the director makes us think that Louise is remembering her past when she could be actually seeing glimpses of her future! What is more, the movie is so slow that one could fall asleep four or five times during the movie! In here, everything happens every 15 minutes than the linear films we are accustomed to watch. This is why Arrival is not better than neither Prisoners nor Enemy. At least, in both movies from 2013 follow a linear path with a mysterious end, whereas in here the inexplicableness is not around the heptapods but Louise's visions.Despite this, it should be pointed out that there is no better choice for Louise Banks' role than Amy Adams. She is just brilliant. Every single move, word and look is just outstanding. And that is what the movie is about. The movie is all about Louise and the interactions in her mind, with her friends and between the 'aliens heptapods'.As a matter of fact, the problem is presented in front of us and it is something like ""imagine that there are 12 alien ships which have just arrived and positioned themselves around the globe - what would you do?"" Well, if the word was given to the Chinese General Shang, he would probably destroy humanity. But let us not forget that ""in war there are no winners, only widows"". Why do we have to fight? Let us learn the language of these aliens, teach them our language or let us do both things. Let us think about the consequences! Some of them could be changed. Others, like Louise's case, could be foreseen, and although Hannah's future will be dreadful, it might be worth to enjoy her a little bit.In a nutshell - the idea of the movie is excellent. It touches both reality and fantasy. The timing and pace were the only issue to convert this movie into Best Motion Picture of the Year at the awful Academy Awards given to the Moonlight-Disaster."
" Smart SciFi
",0.4019,0.7438,2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,"This is not your action packed Alien SciFi movie. I saw some negative reviews call it boring and slow, but I thought it was brilliant. it was smart and interesting. It's the kind of movie that made me continue to think about it the next day and makes me want to go back and watch it again to see the subtle clues that I missed. Throughout the movie you think that one situation with the characters is going on, and then one 4-5 word sentence from a character towards the end of the film completely changes your whole perspective on the film. If you haven't seen it, I don't want to totally ruin it for you because the emotions that play in your head - especially being a mother/parent is what makes this movie spectacular."
" Best hard scifi since ""Moon""
",0.5859,0.9854,2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"PwC's Abbott and Costello routine with the Academy Award Best Picture envelopes should have been used as an opportunity to have a rethink. ""La La Land"" despite it's 6 (or was it 7?) wins was certainly not as good either this film or ""Hidden Figures"". ""Arrival"" is more the narrative sister of ""Hidden Figures"" than it is ""Contact"" to which it has been extensively compared. First, it does not share the disastrous Deux Ex Machina second act of the Jodie Foster vehicle, instead of using a ""Pulp Fiction""-esque nonlinear structure to present a tight narrative from start to finish. Second, the science shares co-pilot duties with philosophy throughout ""Arrival"" while ""Contact"" eventually devolves into an ""I am your father"" search for identity and failure of the movie to dance with the rationality that brought it. The invited cast to this dance acquits themselves well throughout the proceedings although theoretic physicists don't generally look like Jemery Renner. Amy Adams' doughty-named Louise is reflected in her own look somewhat past the spring of her days in knockoff Rom Coms such as the formulaic ""Leap Day"". The story very much is not a knockoff reflecting vital current issues in scientific thinking including the limits language imposes on thinking and implied limits on the human mind. Having said that the original 1998 publication date means we don't see the application of artificial intelligence that would certainly have been brought to bear should the alien visits have occurred in 2017. The story also gifts college film studies' professors with fertile discussion questions for their classes. It also reinforces the principle that all great movies have a great question at their core. The visuals, while very serviceable, are not quite at the same level of greatness as the questions raised in the script. The heptapoid aliens Abbott and Costello look more like forearms and hands thrust down from the top of the screen into a fish tank in need a cleaning. The alien ships they inhabit look more like one of those brown nuts you need a metallic nutcracker to open and our limited view within the ship is a square hallway which more like an especially deep storage unit than anything else. One wonders expects the giant hand creatures reach down and wipe it with a Clorox clean-up wipe after the humans leave for the day. In short, while not visually arresting, ""Arrival"" is a smart, taught story which asks much of its audience and potentially was the best film of 2016."

" A Sci-Fi masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9922,2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"I was expecting just another sci-fi movie but my mind was blown away. It's not a movie for everyone because not everyone can understand same things. This movie is not about aliens it is about dimensions we can'see or understand that contain out thoughts, feelings, energies. This is a movie about our contact with those dimensions and only a few can communicate with them and understand them. It sends a strong message about time and love that transcends time and all other laws. It gives a strong feeling about circularity of time and ""past lives"" as we sometime feel like we already know something we shouldn't be knowing the same way as Louise knew things she shouldn't be knowing. I strongly recommend to watch it in peace and to bi 100% in it or otherwise you'll miss the point. A masterpiece for true movie and other dimensions lovers."
" Good Film, but Wastes the Original Material
",0.5994,0.9966,2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"After 1400-odd reviews, I'm sure this has been said before, but I have to add my voice to the chorus. Arrival is a nice little SF thriller, well-filmed, nicely acted and brimming with atmosphere. But as an adaptation of the original short story upon which it was based, Ted Chiang's ""The Story of Your Life,"" it's an utter travesty.(I won't reveal much about either the film or the story, but there are some generalities that are worth stating.)Villeneuve is a director whose work I've enjoyed and admired. And I can appreciate that there must have been enormous pressure to create a marketable film. Profit figures indicate that Villeneuve succeeded, by crafting a moody, modernized take on ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" It's all a bit over-familiar, but well executed, and enlivened by beautiful digital imagery.Unfortunately, financial success was achieved by throwing away absolutely everything that's truly worthwhile about the original story. I won't give away much, other than to point out that the change in titles tells it all. The short story is subjective, and it's not about the effect that alien Arrival has on Earth's politics or culture. It's about the aliens' effect, and particularly the effect of their language, on one person. And it's told very much from the point of view of that one person.I enjoyed Arrival, but I was also massively disappointed that Villeneuve failed to deliver the movingly existential gem I was expecting, and which as a director he was amply capable of creating. If you haven't seen the film, I strongly recommend you read the story first. It's by far the greater of the two works, and deserves to be experienced without preconceptions."
" Not enough entertainment to me
",-0.3252,0.8645,2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"Without honest Arrival is a kind of movie that critics like. To me it is too familiar and feels old fashion. The theme of Arrival has been be tangent in some Star Trek episodes and because of that it doesn't feel fresh idea to me. Arrival is a good movie, but somehow predictable and way too slow. As an episode of a television series it might work, but as a two hour movie it is simply too long. Even plot feels somehow clumsy. If you want to make serious science fiction film sappy romance won't be a part of it. Especially when chemistry between lead actors doesn't feel right in any level. End scene of the movie is also stupid and hasty. There is no real meaning for the aliens and suddenly they just disappear???. Beside all that Arrival is a quite good movie. It is not bad, simply too long and slow. It is a kind of movie that make movie critics pee honey. I am sorry to say that Arrival is not movie to me, even probably many people likes it. Arrival may be a good movie at a certain kind of mind state, but to me it didn't work well enough."
" Best Picture? Yeah, Not quite...
",0.7506,0.9984,2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"No spoilers: Usually when a movie has such an abundance of one star and 10 star reviews, one can safely assume that the movie was fiercely hyped. I advise throwing out all of the 'oh my god! worst/best film ever!' reviews. The truth is this movie had a bunch of pretty big flaws, but still had a compelling story and good production values. Depending on what you like, you will most likely give this movie 4-8 stars, and that is what it deserves. How this film was nominated for an Academy Award is beyond me. (Great to see an SF movie nominated, just wish it had been The Lobster instead.)This movie is speculative fiction, but the lack of science in this film is devastatingly apparent. There are a couple of other points that seemed very weakly written, but the movie on whole was well crafted. Acting, production values, score, etc. were all solid. The concept of the movie was great, but the plot and script needed work. I personally found the film engaging and was not bored. There is enough here to think about, but so much more could have been done with this film. Personally, I rate it a 6.5/10.== SPOILER ALERT == So, the big problems as I saw them were in the plot. Once communication was achieved, data is collected and understanding of the language advances without any real reveal on how this was accomplished. We are just supposed to swallow that and move on. OK, maybe, but... it's just too much. As someone interested in linguistics, I want to know more about the possible processes used to communicate with an organism that does not share our cultural objects, our environment, an alphabet, etc. It struck me as odd that a classical linguist would be given this job instead of some scientist who studied other species and non-human communication. Wouldn't a Jane Goodall have had far greater insight into the language of an alien race? The second big gripe I had was one single line at the end of the film. The linguist hugs her colleague and they realise they want to be together. OK, boring, but fine. Then she says this one line, basically if you knew what would happen in your life ahead of time, would you change anything? Why would she ask this question? It seemed to me that if she had truly 'learned' this alien language and all the philosophy it included, she never would have asked this question. She would have accepted it all, and not asked something so 'Philosophy 101'. She would have known there was no changing anything and that things are only as they are. I'm not a philosopher or a linguist, but I never really bought that she was either.On the plus side, I thought the 'memory/vision' flashes were cleverly done. We viewed them as dreams or memories when they in fact a glimpse of the future. I felt like they pulled this off quite well, and that twist of the plot was clever. For me, this is where the movie scored extra points, along with the visual communication aspect of the aliens. Just different enough to give the brain some food for thought.====End Spoilers=======The fact that this movie was nominated for an award is an insult to SF. I have seen several far, far better pictures in the last few years. I cannot believe that this really viewed as the best one by the Academy. Unfortunately this just shows the politics and sway that factor into the nominations. By all means, watch this film. It was enjoyable and good entertainment. If you want to watch good SF though, give The Lobster a try."

If you enter a cinema wanting something specific from a film, you're most likely not going to get it. Simple. Who wants a film to be generic and predictable? I don't. Well, I say this yet there's an endless conveyor-belt of generic s*** which gets released each week.

" Nothing fabulous
",-0.4168,-0.9376,2017-03-04 00:00:00,5,"All in all, it was an interesting film that did grab your attentions in some scenes, for example, it was interesting to see the people's reactions when they found out the news of the aliens' landings, and what they continued to do after that with the army flying over them in Jets etc. When the US army came to pick her up, it was a little bit expected, no big surprise. And when they got to the base that was beside the 'space craft', nothing very interesting happened there as well. Once they finally entered the ship, it was a little bit interesting, but nothing exciting that has you on the edge of your seat. It only got a bit exciting when they started learning the alien language and managed to start communicating with it, which also brought into view a historical perspective, on how the early settlers e.g. Captain James Cook managed to communicate with local islanders such as the Maori or Aborigines. The end was the worst of all. I was left completely confused on what on earth it was talking about. All the images from different times switching back and forth, not knowing whether it was future or past or present, and having to get your mind around the fact that none of that had happened yet, even though she'd been having those flashbacks for the entire movie, made it hard to fully understand and grasp. I personally think that the end ruined the entire movie with all its future-telling-revelations and then confusing flashbacks that were of the future etc. and was too much to wrap your head around, therefore being my reason I give only five starts. My compliments to the producers and actors on their work though and set-design, animation and picture."

This films delivers to the latter- and I am quite amazed at some of these negative reviews. I will say, you need to stick with this film to the very end- and I could see why some people say it was slow moving, if judging by the first half of the film. I am rarely so positively affected after a film (as in this case) where I will be emailing a friend late at night to recommend it."

Louise, the linguist, is plagued by (what we think) are memories of her beautiful daughter who died of cancer. She seems to be carrying this huge grief. Then, about 90 minutes in she says ""Who is this child?"" The aliens solve the mystery. They tell her she can see the future: the child is the one she is GOING to have with Jeremy Renner. And he is going to leave her when he finds out she knew that their child would die but chose to have the child anyway. The big ""Sixth Sense"" surprise is that they were not memories, they were premonitions. So, are we to believe that Louise could see that she was going to have a child that would die but couldn't predict an ALIEN INVASION? And how did she know the last words of the General's wife. Did she also become psychic? The movie isn't about aliens at all, it's about what you would do if you could see the future. By the way, if she could see the future, does that mean she could not choose NOT to have the baby. And if the aliens can see the future, how did they not know about the explosives planted in their ship. The whole movie is a pretentious and utterly confused piece of garbage."

I wouldn't be surprised in the least to hear that studio employees were paid to write positive things about this movie.Aliens make their way to our planet because they need our help 3,000 years from now? Sounds pretty important huh? Seems like the fact that they can travel light years across the universe would mean they were far more intelligent than us lowly humans right? Well....if that's what you thought...think again! LOL! These aliens can't figure out a way to communicate until the heroine beats her chest and says, "" Me Tarzan, you Jane!"" Of course I'm kidding but sadly....it's essentially what the character ""Louise"" does. She writes her name on a white board and suddenly these aliens know what to do...what? Are you kidding? Based on what? If they had a Rosetta Stone or an alphabet book, fine. Let the viewer in on that little nugget of info. I could've rolled with that. But no, the viewer is expected to believe in the impossible right from the very start of this movie. For one, wouldn't an intelligent species use a universal language like mathematics to communicate with us? If the aliens decided to initiate first contact, wouldn't they be more prepared to communicate? I mean, if I planned to go to China, I'd start learning some of the language before I went....and I'm a lowly plumber and I know that! And...oh wait...did I forget to mention that knowing their language allows you to see the future? Do I need to repeat that?

Adams, Whittaker, and Renner do a great job. Don't go into this expecting an action sci-fi. It's far from it. It's a thinking man's sci-fi and you need to follow it. It has to do with linguistics, math, and something I don't want to give away. Watch this when you feel like thinking a bit and want to relax at the same time.

Normally, you know, the tears come at a sad scene, or a particularly uplifting and gratifying scene; this film, by the stars above and fires below, ARRIVAL, completely blew me away. It puts even Interstellar to shame. I'm left with a vague feeling of astonishment that is strangely coupled with a sensation of enlightenment. For not only did ARRIVAL storm my mind like the tornado that whisked Dorothy away, but ARRIVAL also taught me some things about linguistics, temporality, international relations, and the importance of one's own child and the special moments that you, as a parent, spend with him or her.The essence to all mediums of art - whether film, anime, literature, etc. - is to further our understanding of what makes us human. This is what defines us, what distinguishes us from the lesser animal. ARRIVAL is a story involving aliens. I've seen/read quite a few stories with aliens - but ARRIVAL trumps them all in terms of, simply, its call to humanity. It is a very realistic film; the chaos that ensues after the 12 UFOs suddenly appear throughout the globe is probably what will happen if a similar event occurs in our own world. What should happen if two sentient races of such disparity happen to meet? The first step is communication. ARRIVAL is a story of humans' attempt to communicate with, and ultimately understand, some aliens."

Whom ever decided that aliens resembling giant octopuses could build a craft of such dimensions and then fly it needs their heads see'ing to. And why did it just concentrate on the language deciphering? Was totally boring. A real let down. Please don't make a Sequel !

" The Beauty of Human Life
",0.5859,-0.4953,2017-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Arrival is one of the most brilliantly written films that I have ever seen. When I initially saw the trailer for this film, I assumed that it would be a pointless sci-fi movie about aliens invading Earth, humanity's struggle for survival, and the realization that we are not alone in the universe. However, I found that Arrival actually focuses more on the beauty of human life than it does on the struggle to communicate with aliens. The writer of Arrival did a beautiful job of making the audience believe that Louise was currently suffering from the loss of her daughter when the movie began. But it is not until the end of the movie that viewers realize that Louise's daughter has not even been born yet. I have not had a movie surprise me in a long time as much as Arrival has. At the end of the movie, Louise is given the ability to see into future. Because of this, she foresees that she and Ian fall in love and have a baby girl together. But Louise also sees that their daughter, Hannah would die of cancer, and Ian would end up leaving her from grief. In the last moments of the movie, Louise is faced with the question of having Hannah, knowing that Hannah would ultimately die from cancer, or finding a way to not have Hannah and spare herself from future pain. Louise asks Ian, ""If you could see your whole life ahead of you, would you change things?"" Ian replied, ""Maybe I'd say what I felt more often."" The movie leads you to believe that Louise decides to have Hannah, even though she knows that Hannah will be taken from her. This is what is so beautiful about this movie to me. Life is short and busy. We as humans become consumed by work and stress and we take the time we have with one another for granted. We do not know when death will part us from loved ones. But Louise is given the gift/curse of seeing the future and knowing the pain she will endure by losing her daughter. But because of what she knows is coming, she is able to make the most of the short time she has with Hannah. She saw her daughter was worth having even if she could only hold her for a short time. The beauty of human life is that it is short. But with the time we have we can hold the ones we love. We feel pain, excitement, sadness, loss, remorse, happiness, longing, and joy. These are all things that make us alive. The tragedy of human life is that we miss all these things and we wish our lives away until one day we look back and realize that we didn't make the most of the time we had."

Wait for when you are ready for a deeper, more meaningful sci-fi experience before watching this film. It's really very good."

It can be different based (environment) and it looks and sounds, communicate very different. The challenge. That's what the movie is about. It's a story with 2 tracks. The one: Arrival how can we communicate? The other is jumping (mentally) back and forth in time. (her gift) What did the Chinese general say to her? Just the phone call he heard and she repeated it back in time. Like she ""remembered"" what to say.A clever movie I must say. On a higher scale than Independence day for instance. That was, we are attacked and go to war and we win. Hooray. This was on a subtle way a great movie.Like to see more of this concept movies. 2001 and 2010 where in the top off my list, but this is my #1 now. Enjoyed it a lot."
" Beautiful, although some may not see it that way
",0.5994,0.9548,2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"I'm shocked to see how much hatred there is towards this movie in the reviews section when the general rating is actually pretty good and not only on this website. Maybe this is the type of film that you either hate or you either love. I love it, so it's really hard for me to even thought about bashing it so much. What bothers me about all the bad reviews is that most of them try to destroy the film and the experience of watching it without even given true and valuable reasons of why it is in fact so ""terrible"". Most of the reviewers seem to have a problem with the representation of the aliens, with how long it was, how slow it was, how many holes it has. There are a lot of complaints about the inaccuracy of linguistics of people that probably have never even study linguistics. I have. I happen to have a major in linguistics. And I think is beautiful to come across a movie that deals with something so relevant to our species as it is language. Every interaction scene with the aliens felt incredibly powerful to me. Conveying a message is not just based on sharing the same semantic and lexical structures. Is about movement, expressions, is about contact, whether this could be achieved psychically or by other means. Emotional contact is extremely important in language. Those scenes were my favorites. The relevance of the moment, of giving yourself to the moment. This movie deals with fear, with confusion, with pain. But it is no a simplistic fear to the unknown, it is now a simplistic fear to get hurt. It is about us, about who we are and how we can understand that through the understanding of others. Maybe this is not a movie for people that believe science is the core of society or for people that believe in the idea of aliens with extremely advanced technology that can only come to earth to show off what they have. It's not a movie with actions sequences and spaceships flying around. And I love it, I love it precisely because of that. I guess is a movie for people that believes in love and hope as powerful entities, beyond the idea of scientific power. It's about feelings, it's about humanity. It's not perfect. I agree that secondary roles felt at times irrelevant and yes, I would have love to see more about the language and how they manage to understand these creatures. But this movie does not pretend to give an explanation to every single detail, for a lot of you that may seem as a weakness in the script, a mistake, for me, that feels like it was done on purpose. There are a lot of unanswered questions, but you know what, I rather give my own answers to those questions and feel the experience. It is an experience. It's so sad to realize that so many people didn't get that. Anyway, watch it, feel it. Enjoy it. If you don't like it, that's OK. But there is no need for the hatred. I personally describe it as a beautiful and transcendent film."
" PLEASE do not waste your time like I did

I love all genres of movies from romantic, comedy, melodrama, black comedies, thrillers, action and horror. So I tell you that I have a very open mind when it comes to movies. I am unsure what the ratings are about here and Rotten Tomatoes but how people have fallen for this sleeper sleeper is a serious mystery. The movie itself to deem itself art worthy by presenting a movie that attempts to awaken man's conscious by presenting how horrible decisions and heated actions can be prevented, if we only open our eyes. OK that's my attempt to be mature about this. The truth is the movie is boring and there is no serious plot twist or climax. Its a failed attempt at even a movie because you have gigantic squids that arrive on earth and we humans spend the entire time of the movie trying to understand their message to us. The bottom line basically is the linguist tries to decipher the language and alphabet of the squids, you eventually find out that you can see into the future as you learn and decipher their language and alphabet. And this is the gift that they brought to earth and outta nowhere, swoosh, they disappear. Yes that is it! Hello aliens or giant squids... why are you here? Oh I think I deciphered some of their messages! Now I can see into the future and this was a gift they wanted to present to us before disappearing again and being able to decipher it prevented an attack on the giant squids. Why or what or any logical common sense is thrown out the window to pull the raw emotions of the audience so they can want to believe. This is the first ever review I have completed because I disliked this movie so much that I felt I was obligated to inform people to save their money and more importantly their time!"

I hooted with laughter at both of those films at the time, but after seeing Arrival they suddenly appear stately and meaningful. And at least I didn't haven't to squint in the dimness of it all. The over-use of TV news and gasp TV news seen on laptops to tell the story in here grated with me, it always looks like a lazy script when they fall back on that old fashioned and hackneyed trick. Now add incredibly old fashioned and hackneyed art-house ""music"" comprising random burps farts and groans to this mix.The plot appears as dim and grey as the film: 12 gargantuan alien stone peanuts float down on Earth causing consternation among all the ants in God's garden, turn into gargantuan mushroom caps and after the phoning to a Chinese general of his wife's dying words start gargantuanly fizzing away in mid-air - apparently job done. Er.I'll try again. Expert linguist Amy Adams put in a good performance as usual, but what to make of her deathly serious demeanour for the entire film is the big question. She didn't even smile at Jeremy Renner playing a brainy physicist press-ganged into playing a spare tool. We're told that successful communication with the aliens could take years to accomplish and we can also guess there's years of boredom ahead, when Adams segues into a higher state of consciousness and finds out in seconds they want to help us now as they want something from humanity way in the future. Er.As bonkers as The Fountain and as gungho as ID. The use of flashback memories brimming over with loss and longing to a heart tugging string quartet is the big similarity to the Fountain though, and it works fine again. If you're looking for lightheartedness you won't find it here, or a meaningful examination of the political motives of alien and Man either. Just another arty excuse to explore the overwhelming emotions we all have and can froth to, as we've all lost someone or something in our lives. Including these 116 linear minutes I knew I'd never get back before the film had even started."

" Vaults Villeneuve Into Upper Echelon Of Directors
",0.0,0.9935,2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"I'm always impressed by movies that ""go big"" in terms of scope. I have a lot of respect for filmmakers that just ""go for it"" and try to make as nuanced of a film as possible in multiple different ways. The problem, however, is that it is a bit of a slippery slope. If done masterfully (usually from a superb director and featuring top-notch acting), you have an all-time classic. If all the concepts aren't grasped, though, you have a muddled mess that doesn't succeed at much while failing at a lot. Fortunately, ""Arrival"" is a prime example of the former, as director Dennis Villeneuve vaults himself into the ranks of Nolan, Eastwood, Spielberg, etc. with this effort.For a basic plot summary (no major spoilers), ""Arrival"" is the story of Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), who is recruited to a site (one of 12) of an alien ""first contact"" of sorts featuring odd cylindrical objects. Louise is an expert linguist, and the government hopes she can break the ice and decode the alien symbology. Paired with scientist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), the pair get to work decoding both the language and the science of this new species. Along the way, they discover that the aliens may be trying to do more than just communicate.""Arrival"" is one of the best films I have ever seen...bar none! It combines incredible acting, compelling visuals, and a plot that will stimulate you mentally all the way through. I liken it to a mix of two Nolan films (Interstellar & The Prestige) and Villeneuve's previous work ""Enemy"". There is not one boring scene in the film and each scene builds into the next towards a conclusion that will leave you quite speechless with wonder.I could write for paragraph after paragraph about the intricacies of ""Arrival"", but I won't because it is also one of those films where you DO NOT want to be spoiled going in. I won't go so far as to call it a ""twist ending"" movie, but just the entire concept of the piece is best enjoyed with an open mind.I really hope that ""Arrival"" garners either its own award nominations, or at the very least for Villeneuve, as it truly deserves them. Yes, technically it falls under the ""science fiction"" genre (that usually gets shut out come award season), but this movie is oh so much more! It can be enjoyed by everyone and easily crosses all genre/appeal lines. I may have just seen the movie of the year!"
" Not quite my taste
",0.0,0.9785,2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I really wanted to love Arrival. I'm a fan of so called ""smart"" sci-fi, stuff that manages to bend out of this world stuff with beauty. Arrival was one of those movies that seemed to tick all the boxes (female led, prestige cast and crew) but I found myself a bit let down. The movie is about Louise Banks, a university professor of languages who we first meet in the opening frames of the movie as her she takes care of and raises her young daughter, only to lose her when she is still very young. We then see Louise at her job when 12 alien space ships land at an assortment of random locations around the world. Because of some earlier work she did translating for the military, Louise ends up getting assigned a job helping the army translate and talk to the aliens (quickly dubbed heptapods). Louise and her partner Ian end up becoming close to the two heptapods that try to communicate with them, and they struggle to figure out what to say and how to say it before the trigger happy government attacks the aliens and starts a war they might not win. There's a lot to admire about Arrival. Amy Adams is great here as Louise (sadly snubbed for an Oscar despite the film receiving multiple nominations). The tech work is also very good. This isn't a movie that goes for intensely gorgeous visuals, but there is still eye-candy in the form of the written version of the alien language. The central story and the ""twist"" at the centre of it is really great too, and it's only something that will enrich the film in multiple viewings. And yet despite the intimate story there was something about the film that just didn't work for me, primarily the nitty gritty details of the script. Despite the elegant structure and ideas there's some dialogue that's too quippy and on the nose and there's this whole section in the middle that is just five minutes of information dropping voice-over over montage. It's a weirdly lazy technique for a film that sweats the details. There's also a relationship that ends up being central to the ending and the plot that I never quite bought and doesn't feel organic at all. Your mileage may vary. While I never quite succeeded in feeling that emotional connection that would have elevated the film from good to excellent I can see from the ratings and reviews that others just don't have that problem."

" Ending ruins smart sci-fi movie
",-0.0516,0.9095,2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Most of this opinion 'review' will contain major spoilers about the ending.This is the kind of sci-fi I really like: Intelligent, challenging, with an exploration of big themes on humanity via a sci-fi element or a tweak to reality.The themes are about language changing the way people think, rather than vice-versa, and it's about a very special tool/weapon that aliens bring to humanity. The story is about a language expert brought to try to communicate with the aliens via their very challenging alien form of language.At first her methods look really sloppy and dumb, as she assumes that pointing to herself with a name card will communicate anything concrete and unambiguous, and that aliens have names. But it improves greatly after that.The majority of the movie is very interesting and well done, including the cinematography, sound and effects. It's the ending that ruins everything.She discovers that their weapon is really the gift of their language, which constructs sentences and concepts instantly without regard for the sequence of events. Thus, by really learning and practicing this language, the human mind gets re-wired and can actually rise above time and see the future. They give this to humanity in a way that will bring them together and cooperate, because they saw a future where the humans will help them in return. And then they leave with their mission accomplished.Which is all very well and interesting, except that what do you think the military and governments that were all ready to kill each other throughout this movie, will do with the super-weapon of seeing the future? And what would the military do with people who can or have developed this ability? Which is why the whole ending stinks and reeks of bleeding-heart, simplistic, childish naivete.A belligerent Chinese general changes his mind just because she told him his wife's dying words, when obviously the only thing he would have assumed would be that someone bugged the room he was in. And even if he believed that she did it because she saw the future, his first priority would be to kill such a dangerous threat! The movie hints that perhaps she is the only one that developed this ability because of her gift with languages and she used it for the good of mankind. Which is impossible to believe. As if the governments wouldn't put thousands of people on it to try to acquire the gift and use it for themselves. And even if they didn't succeed, obviously they wouldn't let her go free, and rival governments would want to kidnap or kill her. But no, this movie wants you to believe that suddenly humanity became peaceful just because someone can see the future. What an unfortunately silly ending."

" Better than Interstellar
",0.4404,0.3955,2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,"So many people are totally missing the point. Guys, this movie is not about language, its about time and how we perceive it.Imagine a being living in a fifth dimension where all of ""time"" is laid out in front of them. It is very hard for us humans to grasp this concept, and we will never do because our brains and bodies are made for a 4 dimensional space/time. In the same way we are superior to 2 or 3 dimensional beings (if they exist), yet we cannot actually make them truly understand our 4D world.This is what the aliens are doing, trying to make us understand that time is a construct. Their language evolved in a way that does not include past, present and future because to them its all the same (presumably, there is no way of knowing for sure). This is backed up by science.I really do not understand how a movie like Interstellar can get a lot of praise for totally defecating on science (sending a human into a black hole and them living to tell about it, yeah right!) while this one is totally misunderstood. Poor Villeneuve has every right to hate clueless people like JJ and Nolan, and their fans."
" good not great
",-0.1012,0.9594,2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I was pretty turned off on this movie right out of the gate. It starts like a student film. With a really amateurish juxtaposition of someone 'saying' their emotions. If you have ever been to a student film fest you know what I mean. It was only missing a segment of sloppily putting makeup on to really nail that vibe. Then it gets better, mostly because Forest Whitaker shows up. Amy Adams does her usual great job. As does Jeremy Renner. And the story itself is very good. However the execution was just so gosh dang twee and precious. If you take away the foreboding alien ship and its occupants you have a pile of breathy flashbacks and washed out visuals. Don't get me wrong, I am not expecting every sci-fi film to be Rogue One. However the great core ideas of this story are underutilized. While this could have been a fascinating movie, it is instead boring. I could take the slow pace and precious presentation, if there was something in the way of character development. But beyond Amy Adams character everyone else are just cardboard cutouts that provide utilitarian roles. Even Renner and Whitaker. Maybe in 10-15 years someone will remake this into a decent film?I wonder if the director likes science fiction at all, or is just under contract."
" A very short review of ""Arrival"" (2016)
",0.0,0.9355,2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"""Arrival"" (2016) is an unusually smart and thought-provoking science fiction film. It isn't really intended by its creators as a ""twist movie,"" but it does include an unexpected component that should surprise and challenge the viewer. (I don't want to say more about it, for fear of spoilers.)Amy Adams actually is a terrific actress, and she seems to do well in understated roles that require her to be thoughtful and deliberate. (Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are both quite good too, even if they seem confined to roles here that don't require much range.)One caveat — this isn't a standard science fiction thriller. (Although ""Arrival"" has some decent suspense, I'm inclined to think that this shouldn't be considered a thriller at all.) I do think that viewers expecting a more mainstream film will be disappointed with this story conclusion's more subdued and unconventional payoff.

There were people running around and being violent and aliens talking about weapons and an explosion and everything was frantic and I just did not feel like it was my cup of tea and that other similar movies have been made.I could not have been more wrong and I am so glad I read a review on IMDb that changed my mind and made me want to watch it because that is so not what it is like. This is not just another movie about aliens. It is so much more than that. It is absolutely stunning. Mysterious and heartbreaking and everything comes around at the end. I honestly don't understand why try to pass the movie as something it is not.There are very suspenseful scenes indeed where you can feel the sense of urgency and it is totally justified but ultimately the vibe of the film is awe-striking and somewhat dreamy, which has a reason why and is made clear as the movie comes to a closure.The close-ups are incredible, moving, and the soundtrack blew me away. Oh my gosh. It gave an entire new dimension to the movie and completely involved me and intensified the alien atmosphere.There is only one scene that I did not like because it felt like it did not belong, and the slow pace was a struggle sometimes, even if it was part of the movie's charm, but overall this was an absolutely incredible work of art and I hope you will watch it. If you stick to the story and pay attention, it will stay with you and you will want to discuss it after sitting on it. I know I do!"
" High-Tech Aliens Who Can't Think Straight?
",-0.1695,-0.9706,2017-02-26 00:00:00,5,"The story was weak, the acting uninspired. Aliens as advanced as the seven-footed critters floating in mist would have learned Earth languages long ago and communicated in the usual high-tech ways.The writer gave the inappropriate names Abbott and Costello to the two aliens, missing a great chance to call them Kang and Kodos. But why would two experts in language and math fearful of planetary invasion and mankind's destruction select those names? They were in an ominous and terrifying situation and the aliens didn't look comical.And the humans' method of 'teaching' the aliens English was laughable, with little chalkboards held up so the eyeless near-octopi could read them.The dialogue wasn't interesting. The emotional interaction between Louise and Ian, the linguist and mathematician, couldn't be very meaningful or touching, because so little was said or done. More character development was needed to make us feel for them. Why did they finally get married?--Oh, yes, Louise was clairvoyant! The whole story was nonsense. The two language experts apparently learned the aliens' language to a certain extent, but no explanation was given as to the details of how, or what the symbols meant. Once you get used to the special effects, floating monolith, floating heptapods, and that happens quickly, it's just another ordinary sci-fi yarn. I'd like to blame the actors for their sometimes-insipid performances, but they weren't given much to work with. Not worth a second viewing."

The ""twist"" basically invalidates the main character's reason for having the personality that she has throughout the movie. Arrival also makes the mistake of making this big science fiction first contact movie too much about the personal problems of the main character instead of making it about the subject matter at hand. Because in the end, with all of the time that was was put into so many flashbacks, it doesn't tie strongly enough into the issue of the aliens arriving on earth. Now I understand that the film makers might think that it does. But to me it's just a long drawn out sidetrack that is detracting from more interesting things that the movie could be showing. Now from a purely technical standpoint Arrival is first rate. It looks and sounds good, but Amy Adams character doesn't add up. Jeremy Renner's character is really the only spark of life and personality in the movie but he doesn't get much of a chance to do anything with it. I had high hopes for Arrival but, nope."

The positive was the acting of Amy Adams and Forest Whitaker,Jeremy Rener was not bad but don't like him as scientist(not nerdy-look).The end is original-for Oscar but for me the end is not enough.And the filming crew did splendid work."
" A bleak look at our own failings as a species contained within the wonder of meeting a new one...
",-0.4939,-0.9576,2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"(SOME MAY FEEL CONTAINS SPOILERS)I feel compelled to write a review after observing all the 1* reviews this film is receiving. Trust me I understand that everyone has an opinion but to just nonchalantly give some a low mark just cause it wasn't your cup of tea is childish, and would mean many(who may enjoy this) would miss it.I thought the film humanised a very 'alien' concept, so much to say as it was focused on one woman's goal to peacefully interact with something not of this world, to learn and understand, to interact and grow. Something many lack within our own species.Many have pointed to the small group of Military personnel who try and attack the vessel as silly,and with no basis, but our race over history doesn't need much of a motive to fire the first shot. Only a fear and insecurity, which can indeed build over a small group over a few months.That's what I think the problem people have, the film doesn't hold your hand and walk you through, it's theme is of meeting another species who doesn't see time like us, and this is how I felt as a viewer, that time wasn't linear, that questions of 'how did Louise crack this language/sound in such a short time?' just don't matter, you're looking for logic in something completely illogical. For me it left me pondering my own existence, if with the knowledge the main character held, would I make the same life choices, is the journey, the experience more than the destination. It had me thinking of personal interactions with people from a different country, religious view, sexually, it turned the camera away from the 'aliens' and solely put in our own downfalls as a species. For that reason I believe it's a must watch.In summary, if you're looking for a Sci-fi film with a slower pace, emphasis on small pieces of dialogue, drawn out shots, touching musical score and subtle but powerful performance from Amy Adams then take two hours to watch Arrival and many more to digest it's content."
" The answer lies within
",-0.4215,0.8737,2017-02-25 00:00:00,9,"I love the way Denis Villeneuve tackles well-worn genres and stands them on their head. Now I expect that everything he does will be exciting and different: ""Polytechnique"", ""Prisoners"", ""Enemy"" and now ""Arrival"".I was not so keen on ""Sicario""; it didn't quite get over the bar for me – and Villeneuve set the bar. However ""Arrival"" does, and then some.Here he has taken on the aliens visiting earth with a message classic, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" – with a touch of old H.G's ""War of the Worlds"" thrown in, and taken the whole thing to a new level.It's not just special effects; they're good, but they are not the whole show.When alien spacecraft arrive at many locations on Earth, linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is brought in by the military to try and communicate with them.The film is absorbing as Louise and a team of scientists slowly interpret the alien's language while also attempting to build trust. All the incidental detail seems pretty much the way you would expect humans to approach an alien arrival with some advocating a peaceful approach and others a preemptive first strike.What really makes this film hit home is it's emotional depth. Louise has had troubling experiences and these become bound up in her relationship with the aliens.""Arrival"" has that same insightful quality that was at the heart of Zemeckis' ""Contact"" and Nolan's ""Interstellar"" and also to a degree in Glazer's ""Under the Skin""; they seem to say that the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe is found within oneself.The sense of spirituality in these films separates them by light years from most special effects laden sci-fi films. Jóhann Jóhannsson's rather impartial score also heightens the atmosphere of ""Arrival"".It's probably wrong to pigeonhole ""Arrival"" as straight science fiction; one feels that Villeneuve and the filmmakers were striving for something far more profound – I think they succeeded."

",0.0,-0.7761,2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"Great concept, but a complete butcher job in terms of execution. This film is bland with some interesting ideas laid out between more boring drivel. The aliens have a unique way of communicating which is barely enough to keep one interested. Thirty minutes in I was not remotely engaged. Once we meet the aliens I'm thinking OK it's about to get good. After some interesting linguistics, the movie reverts back to poor dialog and more boredom. Even the climax moment falls flat. Amy Adams is unbelievably dull and I find it hard that her character could draw a circle let alone interpret them. For most of the film her heavy breathing and deadpan delivery are nearly unwatchable. Jeremy Renner adds more of the same. These two have the chemistry of cement drying.The only redeeming factors in the film? The linguistic differences between the human and alien mind. This along with the alien understanding of time and how it relates to the climax of the film are intriguing. Too bad the characters and writing suck. Everything about this film was done poorly. It will leave you feeling nothing--unemotional. If you're into linguistics and the substance of time, you'll find a few interesting moments to think about later. So much potential, literally wasted by a sub par script and uninspired acting. It's too bad--I was hoping for a fully engaging cerebral experience and walked away disappointed."

I get that the writer tried to include quantum theories of time past and present as all available simultaneously (John Archibald Wheeler's ideas.

No bombardment of FX. Yay.It had perhaps three ""aha"" moments which I thought were pretty clever, but for a movie which seemed to be about twists and revelations, they gave away too much in hints and foreshadowing. In fact, they gave it all away. Perhaps it was just too predictable. The final 15 minutes could have been omitted completely. Sure, not every movie is made for geniuses, but don't try to make smart movies for the dumbest of people, please.And China as the main protagonist until the American woman somehow changes his heart? Please. This would have been so much better if the clichés had been... well... not such clichés... Hollywood needs to get past America somehow, and until they do their movies will always leave a sour taste in the most discerning mouths. Perhaps Trump will cure them of their pride."

" Loved it, and SPOILER
",0.5994,0.9819,2017-02-24 00:00:00,9,"My review actually discusses a HUGE spoiler, so please do not read if you haven't seen the movie!One of the reasons I don't like that IMDb took away the message boards is that I can't discuss this movie, which I loved. In my mind, Louise now has a chance to save her marriage, and not hurt the relationship between her daughter and the daughter's father, because now she knows Ian's reaction. So, in this new future, Louise can keep the secret of Hanna's death, and let it all play out with Ian beside her, and with Hannah. It's bittersweet, but a good concept. By becoming fluent in the language of the aliens, she sees life and time as they do. Kind of reminds me of the tralfamadorians from Vonnegut's ""Slaughterhouse Five"". But, this is a different story with a similar concept, and it allows our hero (Louise) to actually change the outcome of her life, and make it better. Even though it means keeping a terrible secret from her future husband.I kept hoping that the technology of the aliens could save her daughter, but I guess that is just not in the cards in the story. I didn't appreciate the little Hollywood digs at Fox news, having a ""Rush Limbaugh"" type screaming on his radio show, and having a crooked mouthed Greta Van Susterin idiot calling for war. But being from Hollywood, of course you're gonna have to take a swat or two at conservatives. Also, the way the Corporal (Forrest Whittaker) dismisses this giant revelation that Louse shares about the gift is totally unbelievable. Just because you are in the military does not mean you are a fool.Overall, loved this movie!! Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did."

" It was a perfect contact, but troubled at the communication.
",-0.3919,0.9883,2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"The film was decent. Nowadays there are lots of altered versions coming that you won't easily say those are the remakes or reboots or spin- offs or whatever they call them in these days. Like 'Premotheus' to 'Alien', this film can remind you a few titles from the past, but 'Contact' is what the majority of us believes it got inspired.The eight Oscars nominees for the film is insane. I know some people liked it, and the film was good, that does not mean it is an Oscar product. I'm okay with the technical side recognition as it deserved that. So visually it was very good, but not a special effects extravaganza. Just a simple sci-fi drama, with a few thrills, particularly towards the end.When the unexpected visitors from the outer-space land their ships in the twelve different locations on the earth, the humans patiently try to communicate with them to learn their intentions. This story focused on the American soil, where experts are brought in to decode the alien language. How the rest of tale develops was told in the remaining parts.To me it smells like a trilogy. If not, it should be. I enjoyed it, mainly because of being a drama. Sci-fi is always associated with action, adventure and thriller, but this drama was something fresh as per todays computer graphics dominated cinema world. This is particularly for the family and older people like the grownups. Like I said the youngsters love action and violence. So it is a one time viewable film and you will get everything in that attempt itself.7/10"
" Angry with 2016 garbage message movies
",-0.5106,0.997,2017-02-24 00:00:00,4,"Now, this is supposed to be a deep and meaningful movie for us humans. This is supposed to teach us people.. life and connection/communication between us. You know what? I am really angry right now and not because of this masochistic movie( i'll explain this later) but, because of the huge amount of public acceptance this film has gotten. I challenge each one of you that find this movie thought-provoking(in a positive way) and motivational to oppose the facts that my mind conceived. And which are those? First of all, this woman and only her acquires somehow the power to see through time. Now, as i understand aliens are granting this power to her. But why? Is this a tool she needs to understand humanity better, or to find her purpose? I really don't get it. Even if this is true, i mean, that this ability helps her, how does it help the audience, us, to build an emotion for our life purpose. What i find, is a masochistic way of thinking, where i know the pain and i am feeling it but i embrace it because i want to live it for real. The last sentence mirrors the protagonist's choice, to accept the future that she already knows is painful and not only for her. But, even if someone says that everyone know the pains and sorrows of life but still we wanna live, then i'd say OK, but why is this some kind of a gift. Seeing the future and accepting it doesn't make me any better. I don't feel better, i just feel bounded to something, imprisoned. This is lack of freedom and it doesn't motivate me to live. Moreover, in one of the positive reviews of the movie that i read at screenrant.com, the author claims that what i previously described as masochistic is freedom of choice. He says that the protagonist knows what's gonna happen to her daughter and to her but she is able to choose either she wants it or not. And i have to ask you, dear author, in what category we put the protagonist if she chooses not to give life to her daughter. It is not freedom, this is just fake freedom because it is pushing you to become either a ""murderer""(even if not a true murderer you have to live with this burden for ever) or a masochist(i explained that before). To be quite frank the decision she took in the movie, the masochistic one, is the worst and most selfish, because apart from everything else it shows that she doesn't even care about her husband's and daughter's will and opinion, so free will for her and no will for the others. Because of these, i don't see how this ability can be a gift for a human and moreover how can this hypothetical scenario can help us, as humanity, to truly love our lives and others' rather than being selfish deep thinkers who want to live their lives. As for the second part of the meaning ""Arrival"" is endowed with, which is peace and connection between people, i have to say that it is as shallow as shallowness or simply dumb. Why? Because of the reason that people come together in this movie, which is for no reason. But, please, explain me the reason that they and us, the audience, must feel connected and in peace. Is it because the protagonist in the movie tells china president, or something, the last words of his wife? Even if this is enough to bring people together in the movie, it is not in real life, so please ""sci-fi industry"" either deliver us more obvious and definite messages or just stay on star wars...."
" Fantastic but not a 10
",0.3182,0.953,2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"I really loved this film. It has an emotional impact that is rare in SF films these days. Contrast this with the awful ""Passengers"" and you can see how big of swing there is in writing quality in this genre.Others have written eloquently on the quality of the music, cinematography, acting, story, and direction. I can't add anymore to those accolades.*** SPOILERS FOLLOW ****But here are a few reasons why it is only an 8 in my book.1. This is not quite as good as Interstellar or Inception, which are the 10-star gold standard by which I measure other modern SF films).Why? a.) The score for Arrival is quite good but it is not of the Hans Zimmer caliber we hear in Interstellar or Inception. b.) The story, while very strong, still has a bit of the clichéd ""Get your act together humans and work together or else"" kind of feel. The Nolan films were completely unique and free of clichéd SF story lines.2. The flashback editing is, in many places, a cheat. The entire film is actually a flashback starting from just a few minutes in but once in the main flashback time-line there are combinations of flash-forwards and flashback. It's easiest to visualize the time-lines as ""Now"" at the opening and closing of the movie with flashbacks from that time-line being the scenes where Hannah and Louise are having conversations about this and that. Meanwhile, the main story-line of dealing with aliens is actually a flashback at least 25 years in the past from the ""Now"" where the movie begins and ends. In that time-line the narrative is continuously interrupted by flashbacks from the ""Now"" time-line and then eventually we begin to see flash-forwards from the 25 year in the past time-line of the Arrival of the aliens. Some fans of Arrival categorize all the flashbacks from the ""Now"" time-line as actually being the ""memories of future events"" (flash-forwards from the 25 year in the past time-line) and I tend to think that this is because the director makes very little visual distinction between what is a flash- back and what is a ""future memory"" flash-forward. We eventually DO see Louise having flash-forward memories late in the film after her brain is ""rewired"" by the alien language. This is purposefully (and I think unnecessarily) confusing for the viewer. The flashbacks of Louise's interactions with Hannah start long before Louise meets the aliens and they are much more obviously flashbacks from the opening ""Now"" time-line. It is only much later in the film that we begin to realize that the director is inter-cutting FLASH-FORWARDS (e.g. Louise has a premonition of a girl with a caterpillar, poking a stick into a creek, picking up a stone, etc.). In those scenes we sense that Louise is only getting fuzzy glimpses of future events - which are completely different from the crystal clear conversations such as we have seen earlier in the film (discussions of ""win/win"" term definitions, drawings by the young Hannah, why daddy left mommy, etc.). By mixing narrative flashbacks, intended as clues for the viewer (and not something that Louise is actually experiencing as future memories) it muddies the narrative - probably on purpose - to keep the viewer off-balance. Villeneuve could have, for example, made the future memory sequences desaturated and diffuse to make it obvious that they were different from the flashbacks. He chose not to hence, why I think it's a cheat. 3. There was never enough sense that Louise's study of the language was beginning to rewire her brain, as was implied that different languages might. Although we see the fruits of her labor, we never get a sense sense that Louise is living, eating, breathing, and dreaming in the heptapod language prior to starting to see the future (the aforementioned glimpses of the girl with the caterpillar and the stone in the creek). This would have helped us buy that she would eventually start having premonitions about the future.I completely agree with other fans that the film is a thinking-person's movie and enjoyable for many reasons, not the least of which is because the twist, if you can call it that, is not sudden but a slowly dawning one. What I think I most enjoyed about the ending is that it is so bitter sweet. The heroine is successful in one way but meets with profound sadness in another. She unites the world but ends up alone in the end.BONUS CONJECTURE:Learning a language that allows you to see glimpses of your own future would probably cause a human to go insane. What is now and what is in the future would become intermingled leaving the person who learned the language, a quivering shell of a human being.The Heptapods know this. It is their weapon for conquering earth. They teach one very smart human who then deploys the weapon in the classroom and in a book (as we see happen at the end of the film). Engaged and intelligent humans learn the alien language and then slowly begin to go insane as they all start seeing their own future. This leaves only dolts and morons who could never learn the language, as the remaining population. Much easier to occupy a planet of idiot sheep than one composed of a certain percentage of thinking individuals who might fight backDiscuss."

" Interesting or Boring, Depending on a Viewer's Taste
",0.1027,0.9935,2017-02-23 00:00:00,7,"Having read many good and bad reviews of this film, I am not going to go into too many descriptive details as to why I liked this movie, or give away anything too specific as to its plot or conclusion. Instead, I'm going to simply warn those away who might find this film a big yawn. If you are someone who wants cowboys and Indians in space, light sabers, funny looking aliens who happen to speak English, clearly defined good or evil adversaries shooting at one another and blowing things up, then this film will offer you nothing. Clearly, many viewers either felt this movie was a drag or saw themselves as being intellectually superior to its creators. There were complaints of plot holes, clichés, slow pacing and my favorite, pretentiousness, an overused word that often just means the subject was too deep to trouble one's brain over. Some people just want to be entertained, and that's fine, and others don't want to be lectured to, and I get that, too. There is an attempt in this movie to offer some kind of hope that the divided nations of this world might work together someday for a common cause. Some reviewers seem to hate this kind of wishful thinking, finding such ideas trite, and I even read some political rants blasting the film for its liberal appeal and/or its sentimental, romantic sub-plot. These are all valid criticisms, but I don't happen to share them. For my money, this good-looking, atmospheric bit of science fiction story-telling beats most of the big special effects blockbusters of the past thirty years by miles. It reminded me of previous attempts at using science fiction to ponder big ideas, like the definitive film in this genre, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), and later, THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH (1976), CONTACT and GATTACA, (both 1997), DISTRICT 9 (2009), CLOUD ATLAS (2012) and INTERSTELLAR (2014), all varied attempts to get at something deeper than flying saucers and silly monsters. Some of these movies had bigger special effects, faster pacing or greater mass appeal. There is a dreariness to the design of ARRIVAL, but this wet, misty grayness perfectly fit the story. What really boosted this movie to a higher level was the fine acting by Amy Adams, Forest Whitaker and the rest of the cast. Yes, ARRIVAL is a bit slow moving, and although the musical score is beautiful, it was a little too present and insistent for my taste. Those were my main criticisms. I also wish the film makers had taken a cue from Hitchcock and sprinkled the script with a good dose of humor. But being a serious attempt at getting at some fundamental human questions, which have never been simple - how we communicate with those who don't speak - or think in - our own language, how we relate to time, our past and our future, how we overcome our deepest most common fears in order to avert human disasters - well these things probably left little room for jokes or sight gags. Those of you who have seen this film and liked it, I urge you to read the ""Trivia"" section on ARRIVAL, which includes a lot of clues and information as to how the writers and the rest of the creative team packed the script with references to other stories, movies, characters and their names, and even vintage television. This section enriched my understanding of this work."
" Slow, and really, they cracked the language code that fast?
",0.0,0.9306,2017-02-23 00:00:00,5,"***SPOILERS SPOILERS***Thank goodness I watched this at home and could take a break after the first hour--very slow moving, like your average glacier.A major portion of the movie focuses on the effort to learn to communicate with the aliens who have landed on various parts of Earth. Within what appear to be weeks or months--let's assume months, even though it's never made clear--our heroine, language expert Dr. Louise Banks, has figured out how to communicate with the aliens, who seem to communicate with a few vague sounds and a lot of dynamic visual symbols. Louise and the aliens go from exchanging a few simple symbols (the written word for human, the alien expression for who they are, etc.). A man provides a demonstration of ""walking."" And the next thing we know, Louise is talking to the aliens in short sentences, which the aliens more or less understand. And we're not just talking ""Boy eat apple""-type sentences. No, we're talking abstract concepts like ""what is your purpose,"" ""weapons,"" and so on. I simply could not believe that they could crack the language code so quickly. Sorry.Also, another key plot point of the movie is what appear to be Louise's flashbacks. We come to understand what these are by the end of the movie, but my, wasn't it convenient who and what she did and did not remember? And the timing of the flashbacks was peculiar. I could not buy that at some point during the entire ""mission,"" she did not look at the other character and say, ""Wait, I know you!"" Very inconsistent and unbelievable.While watching this movie I had a distinct feeling that it was based on a book. (It is in fact based on a short story.) Some stories are ""mind"" stories, internally focused as much as anything else, with much or most of the story impact deriving from the state of the protagonist as he/she is perceiving and interacting with external situations. Also, some stories rely on a certain unique written style to enhance the story impact. All of this was my sense about ""Arrival""--that as a written story, it might have been quite intriguing from a mental/psychological and stylistic POV, but trying to transfer something like that to a visual medium like the big screen might have caused it to lose some of that impact. (I have not yet read the short story, so I could be wrong.) Anyway, JMO."
" A stone-cold masterpiece.

Profound. ‪""Arrival"" is a sardonic satire of humanity and our inability to comprehend the language of symbols and art, or more aptly put, what is unknown...This world is sadly not yet ready for the almighty ""Arrival,"" though it couldn't come at a more relevant time than right now. It's undoubtedly one of the most meticulously crafted and well-directed films I've seen in my entire life. Not a single frame is gone to waste. I felt callbacks of the world-renowned Kubrick upon watching the genius unfold before me. Everything connects so wonderfully together that I am truly floored at what I just had the pleasure of experiencing. This movie has the potential to completely change the outlook of humanity and all the limitations inherent in our thinking. I can understand people being confused by it, however, as I was a little foggy as well initially (fog is utilized in this film for a reason). After subsequent meditation and analysis of the film's core themes and symbolism, I thought I had a pretty firm grasp on what the movie was trying to say, and I declared it as my number two of 2016. Clearly I was wrong, as watching this movie a second time clearly solidified in my mind that this movie is nothing but pure, unadulterated genius. My head is still spinning from how well the narrative illustrates the message of the film in and of itself: utilizing symbols (a universal language) to communicate ideas and unify humanity in working as a collective whole to make legitimate progress and live up to our species' highest potential. This reflects the need to piece this movie's narrative together and communicate with others about what it's saying in order to attain enlightenment. The film is seemingly too alien and complicated for some to fully comprehend on their own terms.We follow a professional linguist, named Louise, who is an incredibly intuitive and open-minded thinker, unlike her peers. The ones in charge (gov't, newspeople, etc.) are so cleverly subverted, illustrating how little they actually know in working with the unknown and how to approach foreign life, as a result of being trapped within the confines of their own restrictive bubbles. I feel like this is indicative of not understanding the movie (or any great works of art, really) and dismissing it on impulse, rather than thinking it out thoroughly. Essentially, at its core, this movie is trying to say to live in the moment, work together, and have an open-mind on what is unknown. It's the only way to make genuine progress, as collectivism is key in trying to decipher meaning, both in art and in the real world. If you can't appreciate the sheer brilliance of this movie, then perhaps another viewing is what will do it. I knew the first time it was insanely deep, but not to the extent I do now having seen it again. Do not be bound by time, watch this movie over and over until it fully clicks. It's unquestionably worth it in the long run, as I can feel the influence of this movie glistening within the corridors my soul. It is, without a doubt in mind, a modern day masterpiece. I'm calling it now, this film is destined to go down in the books and will be praised for the remainder of our existence. Watch it and study.https://letterboxd.com/extremewaffle"

Flaws in logic and plot, make it a head scratcher, but it is family friendly. Acting is OK, special effects are average for today's CGI. I'm glad I waited for home viewing."
" Most thought provoking Sci-Fi Movie in years!!!!
",-0.5017,0.9639,2017-02-22 00:00:00,10,"What makes a good Sci-Fi movie? In my opinion a good Sci-Fi movie must leave the viewer totally astonished and wondering how you would handle a similar situation? Arrival ask a simple fundamental question, if you could see the story of your life before you have lived it would you change things? Imagine knowing something awful would happen to someone you love in the future, would you change things knowing that you would also be missing out on the happiest part of your life? If Arrival tells us anything its life is about the journey not the destination!!!!!! Coming to this answer takes some aliens a linguist and a different understanding of time in a movie that should have Best Picture written all over it!"
" When Aliens are Bad at Communicating
",-0.5423,-0.8752,2017-02-22 00:00:00,5,"I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. Oh, I get the movie, but what I do not understand is how this movie was so highly acclaimed. Was it because we had an alien movie devoid of mass destruction? Surely we've seen that before.Some aliens that look like giant hands in which they use their fingers as feet have parked their hover crafts in various places throughout Earth. Of course, the U.S. was one of their parking spots (you can't leave us out). The military engages these visitors and wants to know their purpose but they can't communicate with them. In steps Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a professor and language expert (which is weird because the aliens make animal-like noises yet the U.S. grabbed a human language expert instead of an animal biologist or even an animal trainer). The bulk of the movie is then spent trying to establish communications with these odd creatures.The film is so pretentious and esoteric. We have to watch the movie interminably drag on with Louise trying to forge a bond with the extra-terrestrials. While the cliché military does its cliché job of following cliché directives, the sensitive and astute Louise is there to make a break through that no one else can.These beings are so advanced and so intelligent yet they can't clearly communicate their demands. Arrival moves so slow and intertwines exposition in there that leaves you wondering what--if anything--it has to do with the main story. I finished watching the movie feeling completely vacant and void of any emotion about it besides indifference at best and a mild disgust at worst. Arrival did nothing for me. It wasn't thought provoking, it wasn't innovative, it wasn't even entertaining. Yes, it took itself very seriously and I don't know why. I think the movie Abyss and E.T. did far better jobs of bringing us aliens to teach us lessons."
" Overrated. Theme similar to Contact.
",0.0,0.9784,2017-02-22 00:00:00,5,"This movie was more about the central human character & her life as it was for the key character in the film Contact. The first 5 minutes were terrible & boring & made no sense to the audience until the end. The movie should have started with the nearly empty classroom scene & placed the first 5 minutes farther into the film. The beginning of any film or novel should grip the attention of the audience or reader. This Director clearly failed to attend basic Directing 101 class.However, the key characters interaction with the aliens & overcoming the language barrier was quite unique & would appeal to a non scifi audience.The space crafts were so bizarrely oriented & crude interiors that they bordered on absurd. The premise that the aliens were here just for the topic of the future life of the key human character & her premonition skills was ridiculous. As was the insane notion that they would send 12 ships to earth just to chat about the future life & premonition skills of the female language expert or just to relay the message they would be back in 3000 years.This is the third scifi film which has wasted a unique alien plot & effects by focusing on the life of the key human. This one inserts scenes from her future life without any prelude depiction of what was going on. They were irritating interruptions. Almost nothing was revealed about the aliens even after she broke the language barrier. She did not even accomplish the minimum of her intended job duties with the aliens. You would also think they would have studied one of our languages before visiting us. The military's lack of site control & security measures was truly unrealistic from reality.Nor did anyone seem to comprehend the aliens had saved her life when a group of soldiers went off the range to kill the aliens. Nor did she thank them. One alien was dying as a result.The music, sounds & background vocalizations are absolutely horrible. It sounds like someone killing a cow. This is the worst I have ever heard on any film ever. It is quite distracting & quite awful. I can't imagine what they were thinking.The heavy breathing & her overacting when they first entered the craft was really annoying. Her constant near fainting was also way overdone as were her habitual hesitations to every question & task. All I could think at those scenes was coward & the military should have replaced her. Especially with her obsession with one word such as human, instead of moving on to something else. The choice of words was also quite bizarre. It didn't demonstrate her supposed language skills. She also should have had pictures such as the earth & galaxy & other pertinent subjects to identify. Their progress was also way too slow.Too many missed opportunities wasted on the key character's personal life which was the central plot in conjunction with her language skills. The language barrier story was unique & interesting to watch although her choice of words to teach the aliens were less than preferable. But her personal life should have been jettisoned from the film entirely & replaced with details about the aliens, their home & intentions.IRL; We need to get off these narcissistic ideas that we are great & the center of importance in the universe or the idea that aliens have any interest in helping us. Their only interest is in collecting our water resources, plant & animal life, ores & minerals and using us for laborers or experiments. They are not here to save us so we need to stop deluding ourselves with false impressions of our own importance. We cant even get along with other countries or have a common language with our neighbors. We are in for a rude awakening when we discover just how unimportant & chaotic our planet's divided population truly is in the universe.This movie reminds me of the art critics who rave accolades over a pile of garbage like made by Homer Simpson and destroy excellent movies like Oblivion. Non science fiction fans or critics or awards should not be judging scifi films. Nor should studios get involved with film titles & details like they did with Robinson Crusoe on Mars. An excellent realistic film forced to carry a bad title & no marketing promotion.The language barrier theme is good enough to hold your attention so the movie is watchable without violence or battles but lacks any technology or special effects, even on the space crafts. Basically an egg shaped rock with a square tunnel drilled lengthwise & nothing else inside or outside which sits ungainly on the end. The aliens are each a giant Octopus missing one leg. Non scifi fans will like it better than true scifi fans. Anyone who needs battles, violence, special effects, technology & terror to gratify themselves need not bother to watch this film. There is none. It is a lot like the film Contact which focused on the human characters life."
" flawed film still worth seeing
",0.2263,0.9798,2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"I went into this film expecting something along the lines of Contact meets Close Encounters meets Independence Day, and instead found something very different. Now that I've seen it, the film it reminds me of most is Sixth Sense, where the last few minutes entirely re-maps what you think you've just seen. Arrival has plenty of flaws-- the Jeremy Renner character is woefully underdeveloped (and what exactly does his team DO?), the Forrest Whitaker character doesn't seem to serve much purpose, and as many other reviewers have noted, the method used to learn to communicate with the aliens is just silly--although to give them a little bit of credit, they do give the impression that what we are shown is only the tip of the iceberg of the round-the-clock work that was going on.But if you can let all that go, this film isn't really about aliens at all. It's a meditation on grief and pain and the limitations of human knowledge. If you knew how much pain was in your future, could you bear to face it? If you knew how something would end, would you still go through it? It's heartbreakingly poignant.Also want to add that I am not much of an Amy Adams fan, primarily (and oddly) because of her lightweight voice. It suited the princess role in Enchanted perfectly, but in every other role I've seen her in since, she's seemed miscast. So I was not expecting to appreciate her in this film. But by the end she had won me over. I can't think of another actress who could have played this role.So, yeah, it's flawed. There are tank-sized plot holes (as there were in Sixth Sense), and either they ignored huge swaths of what would really happen in an alien invasion, or (to give the film-makers the benefit of the doubt) they chose to leave that stuff off-screen. But it's still worth seeing: fabulous mood-building, solid acting, great soundtrack, thought-provoking and touching story."

Think of the star who speaks with a British accent even if born in New Jersey. The point becomes affectation instead of film making. It is a bit like when we all grokked stuff without even knowing what that term really meant. We were brilliant enough to understand things simply by saying we understood them intuitively. Of course, we really did not understand them, or we could have been articulate about it. Ditto this film."

At times, you have to turn on the closed caption to read what they say. The actors, too often, speak in low tones. When in the helicopter, initially, you struggle to understand their speech. There is a scene where a Rush Limbaugh-like man acts like a foolish idiot, thus mocking him and his followers. If I ever want to be constipated again, I might consider watching the movie again, but I'm sure I'll vomit. So, no thanks. No second viewing."

" Great Film, But Too Much Drama For My Taste
",0.3716,0.9746,2017-02-21 00:00:00,7,"When twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors.Everything about this film is great: the look, the science, the acting, the sound. I especially loved how much linguistics played a role in the story, and how it was explained the various parts of language in thought, as well as the advantages of a written versus spoken communication.I also thought the idea of the non-linear use of time was very clever, and fairly well-executed. I actually figured out the twist about halfway through, but that didn't make it any less interesting or intriguing. Certain aspects call to mind causality, and put them into question: could the Chinese general say and do things in the future that would assist in the past? Under a strict timeline, no. But yet, for the film, it works.Which then raises the question: if the timeline is not linear, not causal, how can Louise access the future at all? Would their not be an infinite number of possible futures? By knowing of her daughter's illness, does not that very awareness open the door for her to choose not to have children and avoid all her visions becoming reality? Or is she doomed to ""choose"" a path that is the only one fate allows her to take? So why do I only give the film a 7 rather than the higher number most people feel it deserves? Simply put, I found the drama a bit heavy-handed. As a science fiction film, it is great, but really diminished by the emotional aspects attached. And while those may be important to certain points the film is trying to make, it still seems like too much focus is put on them. This really brought me out of my enjoyment."
" Not For Everyone...
",0.0,0.9921,2017-02-21 00:00:00,9,"I hear and see a lot of mixed reviews on this movie so I thought I would put my two cents in.Let's start off by saying this movie is not for everyone. There are two types of Sci-Fi movies, those that are more strait-forward and conventional (e.g., Star Wars) and those that are a bit more out of the box (e.g., Interstellar, Moon, Inception). Arrival is most definitely the latter. I went in with very little knowledge of the movie, which may have helped, but more importantly this is a movie you have to watch with an open mind. Things will not make sense until the end so it requires a bit of patience on the side of the viewer. That patience, however, is paid off well at the end with one of the most well- thought of and memorable endings I have witnessed. The viewer is required to pay attention to a lot of details and connect the dots, however if you enjoy movies that get the gears in your head going and enjoy a good mental puzzle, you will enjoy this movie. If you like to watch movies and ""shut off your brain"", you are probably better off sticking to movies like Star Wars.It has been two days since I watched the movie and I am still reflecting on it and on my life as a result, Amazing!"

These pods have broken the laws of physics and contain squids. These squids have come to give them a gift. This gift is their language and the main character goes back and forth from the ship to the research base, it sucked. I'm going to use an old expression used for games.

The thing with this film is to treat it as a meditative medium on notions such as past, present and future (time and space)where they seem to merge, where one is to appreciate the present and let go of the future, on our bonds that unite us or divide us as humans etc. In this regard I found it spiritual and serene. Apparently the director goes for this approach because even with some tension that arises during the film, this is dealt deftly and 'outside' the canvas so that any excitement is squashed before our mind registers what is going on. I did get frustrated sometimes especially in the first half with the dialogue which is very absent and sometimes unintelligible and not revealing and the silence that permeates the film, minimal soundscore, characters are not developed and seem to be in a permanent state of suspension. But then I reckoned this is that type of film, where one has to let go any preconceptions and just absorb with what is going on on screen . That way I enjoyed it and kept me thinking afterwards"

If you are a die hard si fi fan you probably won't love this just because this is more of a si fi/mystery/drama mix. What I loved about this film was the mystery and creativity. This wasn't your standard alien movie and there was a lot of depth to it. The cinematography was incredible, I mean absolute eye candy. The score was beautiful and intricate. And Amy Adams performance was truly show stopping. Not to mention the incredible plot twist. The only thing I didn't like about this was that it was a little slow, but after the first 20-30 minutes the movie really takes off and draws you in. This movie was a showstopper, I highly recommend it."
" Thoughtful and moving
",0.3818,0.9892,2017-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Arrival is a thought-provoking science fiction movie. The plot revolves around alien ships that look like eggs that appear over 12 countries and open themselves for interaction with each country. Amy Adams is the linguistic professor who teams up with a physicist played by Jeremy Renner to try to communicate with the ship that hovers over America.The Director Villeneuve builds tension using pressure between the countries, each trying to break through and find out why the aliens are here. There are very clever usages of time-like flashbacks that give some clues, but what does it mean? There was excellent chemistry between Adams and Renner. Forest Whitaker plays the Colonel in charge and he does an OK job. The most interesting part is how each race learns to communicate with each other. The scenes inside the egg ship are really well done from a CGI and story viewpoint. This movie will keep you guessing until the end, and even then, you might be left wondering if you got everything. And if you like those kinds of movies, this one will touch you deeply from the human standpoint. Director Villeneuve also made Enemy and Prisoners - I recommend both highly. I also recommend Arrival as an excellent example of a movie where plot and acting skills are so key to the success and your experience. Enjoy Arrival!"
" Frustrating
",-0.4404,0.9675,2017-02-20 00:00:00,5,"Arrival reminded me of Contact with Jodie Foster. Two very similar films in both storyline and a feeling of ""is that it?"" at the end.The film could have been so much more but chose to end with nothing more than a ""let's all work together message"" which I found deeply frustrating. The film is well made and well acted but surely a better ending could be found than the one chosen. Decent scifi films have been thin on the ground of late and this one does little to alter that. The story is that aliens want our help in the distant future and need us pulling together now to be able to provide that help later. Later never comes to this film though.I'll go so far as to suggest that this film ought to have been in two parts with the second part concentrating on what happens when the aliens return for our help in the future. That would have made a cracking story rather than the feeling of seeing only the first half.They could have done so much more but chose to settle for half the story."
" Problematic, modestly clever sci-fi
",0.0258,0.5695,2017-02-20 00:00:00,5,"After I finished watching this, it took a little while to realize how conflicted I felt.The movie held my attention, even though there was much more slow motion than there needed to be, and certain sequences were really dragged out much more than needed.The central premise, once you look past the aliens and the peculiar visual elements, is that how we perceive language is fundamental to our understanding of existence.The elimination of time seems to be a problem, and it allows us to understand that the flashbacks we are presented with are actually glimpses of the future. This is pretty clever, but it doesn't stand up to scrutiny. If that's the case, why does she see the future at the beginning before she learns to ""time travel?"" The argument could be made that her learning it later explains this. However, in that case, why is the rest of the story told in linear time? Even more troubling is the value of the circular time approach. If you can perceive all of your life simultaneously, there are no surprises. It raises a problem of free will not existing. It's a remarkably bleak existence, and the movie treats is as though this is some sort of step forward for mankind.I actually feel like this is vaguely Lovecraftian - mankind being given knowledge that we shouldn't have that ruins our lives."

This movie is by far the stupidest, most boring piece of dribble I have EVER seen! Right off the bat, it makes no sense, as they state that there is a glass wall separating the people who approach the aliens, thus being sealed off, and yet they need to wear special suits that isolates them from any possible contaminants. Then, you've got these squid-like beings spouting what appears to be circular ink blots, as this is their language, and the main character's job is to decipher it. So, basically we have these highly advanced aliens visit earth, and they don't figure out our language first? And, for some reason, we have a few soldiers who want to blow the thing up. Uh yeah, right, that'll work! These things are the size of your average city, and you're going to blow it up with a few explosives planted on it? And why blow it up in the first place? Gee, I don't know, but maybe, just maybe that will do nothing more than upset the aliens! Towards the end of the movie it comes down to some sort of time travel thing, or being able to see into the future, or what ever nonsense you want to call it, and the ships all disappear, saying that they will need us in 3000 years. WHAT?!??! Seriously, how are people voting this as the best movie ever? It's boring, stupid, confusing, senseless, and the so-called ""twist"" is just plain idiotic! If possible, I would have given this thing zero stars!"
" Arrival is a thing of beauty.
",0.5859,0.9973,2017-02-20 00:00:00,10,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Arrival is a 2016 American science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve and adapted by Eric Heisserer from the 1998 short story, ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang. It stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner,and Forest Whitaker. Amy Adams plays the role of Louise Banks- a linguist who teaches at a College. One day, twelve giant spacecrafts appear in random locations across the world spreading panic and chaos everywhere. Louise is recruited by US Army for her linguistic skills along with mathematician and theoretical physicist Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) - to attempt to decode and translate the language that the creatures inside the spacecrafts are using in order to prevent a global war. Arrival focuses on the struggle to communicate with the creatures (dubbed ""Heptapods""), and what the aftermath of this could lead to should it not go to plan. The film dives into the philosophy of language and human interaction and how it can be used to communicate with extra terrestrial beings in case of first contact. Arrival is a film that is more than just about language. It shows how divided we are as a species as each nation and culture interprets the alien's language in different meanings. And from this lack of clear understanding it creates fear and paranoia that could lead to global war. But Arrival shows that despite the mystery that surrounds the unknown, the future can be just as hopeful and bright as it might be scary and we should approach it with confidence. ] Amy Adams as Louise Banks is superb and plays the role perfectly. Her performance is truly Oscar worthy in this film. As the LA Times rightly puts it, ""Arrival is really Adams's film, a showcase for her ability to quietly and effectively meld intelligence, empathy and reserve."" It was really surprising to see her snubbed form Oscar nominations. Renner is also solid, and accompanies Adams nicely, even if he can't help but feel woefully overshadowed. Arrival is nearly perfect in all technical aspects too. Music by Jóhann Jóhannsson is terrific and fits perfectly in the films environment. The cinematography (by Bradford Young) is breathtaking and really mesmerizes the viewer successfully acting as a perfect match to the tone of each sequence. The large pitch black objects hovering over the cities feel instantly dark and threatening, and the brief sights of the creatures we're given reveal something wholly original. In terms of technicalities and aesthetic, Arrival is a thing of beauty. Rating: 5/5Best quote: ""Despite knowing the journey and where it leads. I embrace it. And I welcome every moment of it."" - Dr. Louise Banks"

First part of the movie was very cool and exciting. You have your weird genius protagonist convincingly portrayed by the amazing Amy Adams.

She appears to have no friends --- she wound up alone in her campus the next day of the ""arrival"", with a puzzled look that no one else is around. Clearly, none of her colleagues or students texted her: GIRL, ALIENS ARE HERE. DO NOT GO TO SCHOOL. But that was just a fun and flippant observation from me and my sister so whatever.When we saw the spacecraft, I remember myself being awed and extremely impressed. It looks to me like this giant metal leech --- very menacing and has this particular quiet sinister in it (much like real life leeches, of which I am very fearful of thus the mental effect of the spacecraft's shape to me). The movie also has one of the best shots, not only from the movie but from all the alien- invasion movies I've seen so far: that dramatic aerial shot of the wide American rural fields towards the spacecraft, made even more dramatic by those freaky rolling clouds and chilling af musical accompaniment. The aliens look cool as well; I never thought tame giant squids could be potent replacement for the usual aggressive lizard-like aliens in movies. So everything was going great and exciting, our lead is able to befriend the aliens and has made them respond to her in their own language through this ink-like substance. So yey that's so cool they're so cute was mostly my reaction. HOWEVER as the story progressed and the characters are still trying to figure out the aliens' language a month after the initial back-and-forth communication, I felt that the movie was losing its charm swiftly thanks to Amy's character having to deal with her dead daughter's memories. At first we'd think they're only flashbacks and you somehow empathize with the mother's grief. But in the end it was revealed that they were actually memories from the future. Like girl, why didn't you freak out from these recurring freaky 'memories'? Aren't you supposed to call your mom or any friend that something this freaky is happening to you? Sheesh. And to think she would pass out almost every time she has these visions. Girl was def not freaked out about it. So that part of the story was really emotionally vexing for me and it was already taking away so much emphasis from the other themes that the movie has introduced and needs to address more such as learning the Heptapod's language, the different ways nations are dealing with the arrival, or even why Jeremy Renner's character, oh scratch that, all characters there were rendered almost useless. And that conversation with the Chinese General part... we were definitely one of those who left the cinema pondering about it, clueless af it felt hilarious. The reviews I saw for this film were almost polar opposites. You either deem it as extraordinary and mind-blowing or boring and unsatisfying. Well, if you have read this long review of mine in its entirety, you know where I stand.thefleamarcat.com"
" Arrrighty Arrival!
",0.0,0.8622,2017-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Here comes a puntapod arriving to your viewing eyes, as I review the sci-fi flick ""Arrival"". Please don't run away, I pun in peace. Acclaimed Director Denis Villeneuve's ""Arrival"" stars the astounding Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks, an expert linguist professor who is called in by the U.S. Government when semi-oval saucers arrive in several locations throughout the globe, including Montana in the U.S. Her duty is to try to decipher communication from the arriving heptapods, not an easy task. They should have just called Trump to deport the illegal alien heptapods, problem solved. Anyyyways, off the politics. Dr. Banks is paired up in this mission with Dr. Ian Donnelly, an expert physicist, played well by Jeremy Renner. This is not your simple alien story, there is a twist thrown in by the brainy humanoid movie director Villeneuve that will throw you for a loop. You can take it to the bank that Adams was robbed of a Best Actress Oscar nomination in her performance as Banks. Eric Heisserer's screenplay of ""Arrival"" was earthly sound, even though it had a tad too much of the scientific jargon; but I guess that comes with the sci-fi territory. If you still have not arrived to the viewing landscape of ""Arrival"", I suggest you do so now. **** Good"

Please watch it to see for your self because it is a good movie if you're willing you pay attention.Good:1. Both the cinematography and visuals are beautiful and astonishing.2. Amy Adams portrays her character very well and does a good job to make you feel sympathy for her.3. Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whitaker were good in the performances, even if their roles seemed pointless.4. The story is very interesting and the ending is surprising.5. If the underlying message of this movie is what I think it is then I think it's very special and and very could message to send, particularly in the state of the world right now. Alas, I doubt this was intentional but I can still hope.Bad:1. The ending was very ambiguous and more would have been desired. It could be actually be perfect, making this point invalid if my theory is true, however I doubt it is, therefore I must say that more could have been desired.2. Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whitaker's characters were pointless and had no reason to exist other than to have Amy Adams have interaction with humans.3. The tagline of the movie was 'Why are they here?'. This was an interesting question but they just sweep aside the answer like it's not important and that really annoyed me.7/10"
" 'Arrival' Is a Masterclass in Filmmaking With Amy Adams Magnified
",0.0,0.9907,2017-02-19 00:00:00,9,"The science fiction genre has evolved into some of the most prolific imagery and storytelling of the silver screen. Denis Villeneuve's splendid ""Arrival"" has the foreign director taking on uncharted territory and putting forth his finest film of his career yet.Starring Academy Award nominee Amy Adams, ""Arrival"" tells the story of unidentified spacecrafts that enter the earth's atmosphere. Just hovering over the ground in dozens of locations around the world, it is up to a linguist and a scientist to break the language barrier and find out if their intentions are honorable or hostile.Natural comparisons will emerge to Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar,"" and while that film's ambition was generally accepted and positive, ""Arrival"" taps into something Nolan's film only hoped to achieve. The exquisite class in which Villeneuve's film exists is such a daunting and audacious triumph. Eric Heisserer's script may at first feel familiar, perhaps too much so, as the first half of the film seems like the same foundation we saw with Alfonso Cuaron's ""Gravity."" When the story is turned on itself in a soft and credible fashion, ""Arrival"" opens itself up as one of the year's most brilliant feats.With performances that have spanned a vast net of quirky and strong supporting players (i.e. ""Junebug"" and ""The Fighter""), Amy Adams has emerged as a fully realized leading lady. While some will attest her previous lead roles in ""Enchanted"" and to a lesser extent ""American Hustle"" as proof that she's already mounted this campaign, discovering what she does here will make you change your perception. She is a talented artist, sensitive and endowed with the tools of a legendary actress. It is a beautiful work.Co-stars Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are served well in their minimal roles. As the slick but engaged scientist, Renner approaches his role with the utmost candor. Whitaker, as an army leader, is blunt, honest and frank – everything you would want in anyone playing a character such as this.Cinematographer Bradford Young is utterly suave in his usage with the lens. Already capturing our hearts with his works on ""Selma"" and ""A Most Violent Year,"" Young's glossy and poised framework is not only exciting, but visually moving.For the third year in a row, composer Johann Johansson raises the bar for nearly all creators of the musical language. ""The Theory of Everything"" and ""Sicario"" were just the beginning for him. He mounts an orchestra of vast sensations. The sentiment of each scene is built within Johansson's response to the words on screen. He not only has respect for the visual works being created, he compliments the details in which the expressions and languages endure. It's another Oscar-worthy work that will undoubtedly bring him another nomination.""Arrival"" is a film that can seem bigger than itself. Perhaps it's even ""too smart."" However, movies should challenge the viewer. The stamina of a film rests on its tenacity and persistence to dare the viewer to explore new thoughts and feelings. ""Arrival"" achieves just that. It is a film that should be noted in multiple Oscar categories and revered by all except the most impudent viewer. This film is not to be missed.GRADE: (★★★★)"
" Like the acting, but the logic is off
",0.1901,0.9515,2017-02-19 00:00:00,6,"I like the acting part of the movie a lot. It is very well paced and details have been perfectly addressed. But, I am a little disappointed by the plot line of this movie. I was expecting something more bold - the Aliens just came here to show some calligraphy of languages? OK, yes, the language is the key to open the possibility to bend the time axis psychologically. But, does this imply that the setting here is that everything is predetermined? ... I would really wish this movie can go deeper about their setting of the world."
" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.3141,2017-02-19 00:00:00,1,Most boring movie I have ever watched...it just drags on and on. There really was no point and nothing to keep you interested in the story line. My husband insisted we watch until the end thinking at some point it would get good or make some sense...never did. Not a movie I would recommend to anyone.

Well, although it is very well acted, I must say that the time line is very confusing and it is easy to be totally lost. Also, I would think that an advanced alien society would have some means of communication with the human race and not need to wait on an interpreter to find out what they want to say. Not sure I am that happy spending money to see it on big screen. Scenery is very well done. But I don't think this movie deserves a 8.1/10 rating."

To pass, and the pace is great, Arrival is a spectacular and very clever film, it's my favorite movie of 2016. Note 9.9"
" I am literally worse off for seeing this
",-0.4767,0.9761,2017-02-19 00:00:00,1,"This was literally the weakest film I have ever seen, and I joined IMDb just to write this review. Arrival is an insult to any smart moviegoer, and a good example of the results and high ratings you will get by simply throwing a ton of money at a thin plot and disgusting script. So, this is business and movies make money - well done then.But I'd rather see something memorable.Arrival is basically a terrible remake of the brilliant Contact (1997).This is not even in the realm of sci-fi, as the science is never attempted to be explained (thanks in part to the useless ""theoretical physicist"" character played by Renner) - Arrival becomes just another fantasy flick.The cliché 'narrow minded grunt army corporal' (Whitaker) picks Adams as the foremost expert on language to communicate with the aliens, berates her when she doesn't understand the aliens - then almost immediately questions her tactics. Whitaker, y u do dis movie?There is even the bit when a rogue attacks the peaceful aliens - a la 'Contact'. After which, the operation is called off and the area evacuated - though Adams is able to thwart the high security by running across a field to access the craft again.Booming ""alien"" noises (War of the Worlds, 2005) for nothing more than jump-scare value and play no part whatsoever in communication.On arrival to the forward base, Renner and Adams are told they will be heading up their respective emergency departments, then are immediately taken into the craft for the first 'session' - with not so much as a quick briefing on the situation!Adams: ""What do the aliens look like?"" Whitaker: ""You'll see.""Really?Along with a multitude of sensors, they literally take a canary into the craft visits (once used in coal mines as an early warning system - ceased in 1986).Renner's character is goofy and boring (he's supposed to be a top theoretical physicist). I was excited when he was introduced to the movie - But disappointingly, is used solely as Adams' love interest - but not until right at he end - and nothing else at all. There are friendly ships and aliens that defy all known physics and that is the best the movie can do.The only thing I found OK was that they did not use the cliché movie alien form.Cheers."
" Feeling a Part of Something outside Ourselves
",0.128,0.9886,2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Boy, did I need to see this! 2016 was a tough year for many reasons, both generally and personally. It's not often I watch a movie twice in a row, but after seeing 'Arrival' the first time the other night, I couldn't wait to put it on again. I've always been a huge Amy Adams fan—two of my favorite movies of hers being 'Enchanted' and 'Julie & Julia.' She's one of those rare actors who can exhibit both vulnerability and strength at the same time and break your heart in the process. And as a professor of linguistics trying to solve an impossible mystery, she is at the top of her game.I won't recount the story here—you can watch the trailer for that. But I will point out a few things I felt made this film—nominated for eight Academy Awards at the time of this writing—brilliant. First off, the writing. The story by Ted Chiang is filled with a profound sense of human longing—a longing to connect with something bigger. Many people interpret this as a search for God in our lives, and I happen to believe that. But I think, in general, people want to feel a part of something outside ourselves. Something that gives life meaning and us a purpose. The screenplay, based on that story, captures this feeling beautifully and reinforces it throughout so that by the time you ARRIVE at the end, you can SEE.The direction and cinematography were perfect for this kind of storytelling. Everything that happens is seen through Louise's eyes, and we unravel the mystery with her. As if things weren't difficult enough trying to decipher an alien language, she is always surrounded by strangers—army personnel and CIA operatives—whose purpose she can't fathom and who seem to be in opposition to what she's trying to accomplish. Inside the massive floating spacecraft, we lose our sense of direction. And the playing with time itself throughout is hypnotic.Of course, any good movie has lots of conflict, which in this case is presented in the form of people's paranoia about the aliens. The armies of the world all want to know what the aliens' purpose is in coming here and, judging from their actions, they are all on a hair trigger. The director Denis Villeneuve captures this intense struggle with simplicity and clarity. And to balance things out—because not everyone in the military can be bad—we have the character of Colonel Weber, who is just trying to understand. Oh, and that soundtrack! Pay attention to the horns every time we see the aliens.In the wrong hands, 'Arrival' could have turned into 'Independence Day.' Thank goodness cooler heads prevailed! No doubt, I will see it again."
" Probably the best sci-fi movie of the year....
",0.6369,0.9883,2017-02-19 00:00:00,9,"While the highest grossing sci-fi and overall movie of last year remains Rogue One, the one that's getting a lot of awards and acclaim is Arrival. Directed by a Canadian whose most known work before this was Prisoners with Hugh Jackman and Jake Gylenhall which was a hit in the fall of 2013 and a cult movie. Made on a moderate budget of $47 million, this sci-fi thriller is worth a buy on Blu- Ray with awesome CGI, great casting, and some cool music. Amy Adams shines as the main character while Jeremy Renner is her co-star in a movie that kinda meanders a bit on pacing yet gets interesting towards the end. The Blu-Ray's sound mix is pretty good and very loud; the abundance of special features consisting of featurettes makes up for the lack of a director's commentary, although the lack of a DVD is now common among newer movies that come with a digital HD file which requires payment via Itunes or Ultraviolet. If this movie wins Best Picture, it will mark the first time since Lord of the Rings 3 that a sci-fi fantasy film has won the award. See it once, or even twice!!!"
" The Wheels Come Off
",0.0,-0.7479,2017-02-19 00:00:00,4,"The movie takes two interesting ideas, the nonlinear nature of time and the relationship between linguistics and psychology, and creates a steaming pot of gobble-de-goop. There are loose ends, logical inconsistencies, and an irritating aura of pretentious blather that apparently is suppose to inspire a sense of shock and awe. It felt like the director was out of his depth and was simply incapable of pulling it all together in the end. Maybe he didn't care and we were suppose to be fascinated by the mystery of it all. But when the director himself doesn't seem to get it, with all due respect (I did like Sicario), you end up with a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury and signifying nothing. Predestination explored the time travel paradox. Ex Machina explored Artificial Intelligence and consciousness. Both films masterfully came together in the end and blew my mind. With Arrival, instead of OMG, it was WTF."
" Love a movie that makes you think and contemplate...

Makes you think for sure...would you live life differently if you knew the price you would pay for the greater good of the world...heartbreaking and yet still came away wondering, given today's climate of the world...what would it take for the world to finally come together, to work together and see the wisdom of doing such a thing.I don't know that Amy Adams deserves an Oscar but the writer of this film certainly does and I, for one, and pulling for Eric Heisserer who adapted the book ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang. The use of the cephalopod for the aliens...anyone who knows the intelligence of the octopus will enjoy this reference for sure.

",0.5859,0.9926,2017-02-19 00:00:00,9,"Throw away all your preconceptions of alien movies, sci-fi and just absorb this movie when you go see it. The script was inspired, the directing like done by a maestro and the performances by Amy Adams, Jeremy Brenner and Forest Whitaker, flawless.I've watched just about all the alien movies of significance in over 50 years and this one is unlike any of them. It is simply thought provoking. It does not make special effects the centre of attention, but instead those complement well a journey your mind must take. It brings out the human flaws, also the beauty of the human mind and greatness of having an open one, the fearless desire for understanding beyond. The writer was not beneath using a tiny bit of humour to break tension and suspense and I like that. What you will get out of this movie may vary from one person to another but what I got out of it was a sense of hope and peace despite the always looming dangers of man's imperfections.If good movies are suppose to instill strong feelings and make us think, then this one is definitely a good movie."

Arrival is not a perfect movie and it has its share of flaws, but it's great from an emotional point of view, because of the characters and the awesome soundtrack and last but definitely not least, because it's a movie about HOPE."

",0.0,0.9717,2017-02-18 00:00:00,10,"A lot of the reviews I've read regarding this brilliant movie, even the positive, seem to missing a major point. Amy Adams ""memories"" are not memories of the past but of what's to come. By learning the alien language, Amy's character has learned to view her life in a circular manner. She no longer experiences her thought's as we would in a linear fashion, but is now able to relive and experience the emotions involved before they physically occur. Amy did not have a daughter before the alien arrival, but after. She now has the ability to transcend time and see what is to come. Maybe watching this film again knowing this, you will see how truly amazing this movie really is. Hope this helps."

",0.0,0.9925,2017-02-18 00:00:00,9,"I think an 8,3 would be fine as a grade, but since there are so many disappointed people giving the movie a one (you've got to be kidding me, not even the Twilight saga has that score), I've bumped the grade up a bit to compensate.As an English teacher, I'll grant everyone that the language learning should have been done differently... The director steals from us much of the language learning process.However, if you can stand the low pace (do not expect action or a fast movie), it's very interesting and enjoyable to watch.You'd have to buy the linguistic theory the movie is based on... If you are a hardcore hard-sci-fi fan, you might find that some aspects the movie sounds more ""magical"" than sci-fi. Not the movie's fault, that's what happens in the original short story.As for the people that complain about what the aliens are... dammit, cephalopoda are some of the smartest creatures on Earth. It has to be either insects or cephalopoda... because mammals are pretty rare (a weird evolutionary occurrence). So, the aliens were pretty interesting.I hope you enjoy it. But it's not crap at all. Some people just didn't like it. It's certainly better than all the Twilight saga, all the Star Wars prequels and Prometheus. That's easy, though. It's pretty good. However, if you don't like the conclusion... you don't like it. Again, not the movie's fault."
" The Arrival of boredom

An absolute slug-fest of a movie which draws you to flashbacks and flash-forwards of Louise's life. Meanwhile an above-average smart scientist (Ian) does nothing except express faces of awe and finally admits that he's fallen for Louise. Meanwhile the Aliens arrive on some vessel that defies every law of physics and space, they also pretty much happen to be Squid that make noises which are a cross between a Whale and a mating Lion. Louise and Ian proceed to make 54 trips back and forth to the Vessel whilst communicating to these animals via an iPad, at the same time, the World Powers are just waiting on developments from these 2 douchebags else they will send in their tanks.The part that really annoyed me was that these Aliens had the knowledge to see future in 3,000 years, however neither of the 2 clown squids foresaw the future that a C4 bomb would be planted by some crazed soldier that would result in the death of one of them. It was the most unrealistic design of aliens, I think the producer was craving some Calamari when he thought of this."
" 'If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?'
",0.0,0.7679,2017-02-18 00:00:00,10,"ARRIVAL is a refreshing science fiction story that allows the audience to approach the concept of alien visits as something of value rather than the beginning of the end. No comic book antics in this sensitive film based on Ted Chiang's story 'Story of Your Life' and adapted with great skill by screenplay author Eric Heisserer. This is a film that asks us to ask questions about our place in the universe and in the cycle of life using the visitation of extraterrestrials as the stimulus. Denis Villeneuve directs with consummate skill.The dialogue of the film has many rare insights – words that come form the characters such as 'Language is the foundation of civilization. It is the glue that holds a people together. It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict' and 'But now I'm not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrived.'The story line as action is simple – a factor that enhances the importance of the message of the film. Twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world. Linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors with the assistance of theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They join the Army team led by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) in Montana – one of the twelve areas where the craft have landed. Banks job is to try to learn the aliens' language and enable communication with them. Through regular meetings with two of the aliens she starts to compile a record of the aliens' ""language"" - a series of drawn symbols. The important question is - are they friend or foe? Other nations with alien landings are starting to view them as a threat, making it a race against time as war with the aliens could erupt at any moment.With extraordinary cinematography by Bradford Young and a pitch perfect atmospheric musical score by Jóhann Jóhannsson (with a little help from Antonín Dvořák!) and first class acting by both Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, this is a film that should be marked as a 'must see' experience – for many many reasons – especially at this point in our earthbound history."
" The Beauty of Language
",0.5859,0.97,2017-02-18 00:00:00,9,"My sole complaint is an unnecessary montage sequence. That's about it. Villeneuve spreads his resume as a master of science fiction and drama, cementing his auteur status. This IS NOT an alien invasion movie. This is a movie about language and globalism, hidden by the focus of giant spacecrafts that suddenly appear in the sky. That sounds confusing, but once you see this movie, you'll get it. Amy Adams stars in an Oscar-worthy performance as a linguist tasked by an army colonel (Forest Whitaker) with trying to communicate with the visitors, invaders, scientists, whatever they are alongside a physicist (Jeremy Renner). From a cinematic standpoint, this film is beautiful. Beautifully shot, with a great production design, visual effects, and a haunting yet at times beautiful score. This film questions our place in the world yet alone questioning what it truly means to be human. It also questions what we do with power. If we have the power to change something, do we do it. I cannot wait to see what Villeneuve does with Blade Runner and Dune in the not to distant future."
" Emotion and Science
",0.0,0.9989,2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"There are now two upcoming directors which I closely follow: Damien Chazelle and Denis Villeneuve. Of Villeneuve I saw Incendies (9), Prisoners (8.5) and Sicario (8), which are phenomenal movies. I love his style, his movies are dark, slow and intense, not to mention very good. So I was pumped to see this movie, but after a very disappointing summer (and year thus far) what could I expect? Much.I thanked God for this movie that came after a sh!t summer. A breath of fresh air, which is weird as the movie is so dark and slow. Let's start with the story: so a handful of alien ships land on earth with no one having any idea of what they came for or, more importantly, how to communicate. So they find the linguist Louise Banks (Adams) to try and figure out how to speak with the alien visitors.The acting is amazing, well, Amy Adams is amazing and was absolutely robbed of her Oscar nomination (wake up people). She's so subtly very emotional, she doesn't say much but it's all there. You really feel for her, you believe she is figuring out this way of communicating with aliens. Renner is kind of acting besides her, I mean he's fine but just that. People like to talk about Whitaker in this film, but he didn't do anything, so calm down.Yes, the script is amazing, clever and surprisingly emotional. The approach that it takes to find a linguist is very realistic and clever. But it is the structure that is important. (If you haven't seen the movie now is the time to go see it you worthless scum.) It takes you by surprise as the whole movie you are trying to figure out what the flashbacks have to do with the story, or to understand the emotions of Banks. The ending is not only humane and beautiful, really beautiful, it's also very smart. The whole movie, and the entirety of what she feels and through her we feel makes sense. The choice she makes is one of love, pure love, in an otherwise very scientific movie. Which is what I loved too, it's all very grounded. The characters are not black and white, they're complex, all of them. But it's the method of figuring out how to communicate with these beings that have nothing in common with the human race that is so interesting and very well handled and thought out. It's suspenseful, clever and the cinematography is amazing. Every movie of Villeneuve looks just gorgeous. The moment you see the ship, just cinema gold.

My intelligence was insulted by the superior yet inept communications of the aliens. Why did no one think to show these guys a video? Really? a dry erase board? That's the best communication idea we have to share with an advanced alien race? This film doesn't have any deep meaning behind it, there's no 'leave it up to the viewer' interpretation. There's nothing that isn't completely pedantic, spelled out and spoon fed to the masses and nothing that brilliant or that isn't predictable either. I don't know why this film is so popular. There's nothing enlightening about language in this film. Inglorious Basterds had more incite to language and communication that this film. I honestly don't see any draw here. Is this for people that don't normally like SciFi? That have no concept of what a believable alien contact film might be like? Close Encounters is more plausible than this horrible representation. I can't imagine anyone would actually want to sit through this film more than once. It could have easily been edited down by 30 minutes and still conveyed its (weak) message.

In addition to the extremely lame level of politics, no depth whatsoever there, *but the real bullshit was about to strike*) And then when the REVELATION happened.. and oh my god, what a ridiculous lazy bullshit revelation it was!! ; The whole part of the Chinese general and the issue with the top secret number of his, and those Chinese words that no body understood and was like ""meh...not important we just need to forward the plot"" and the extremely ""Convenient"" way the plot uses it to solve the problem destroys any tension the series tried to build up. *FACEPALM* That moment is where Arrival went full retard and insults the intelligence.By the ending of the movie i was disappointed how they completely ignored to provide any answers or any world building to the whole story. Apparently the movie was busy trying to look mysterious and cool, Yeah.... Thanks for Nothing!Some good points: * The movie first hour was a successful mystery which makes the viewer question what was happening and was something original focusing on the language instead of brainless action. * Unlike many modern Sci-fi, Arrival doesn't have bad acting and directing, on the contrary it was good. * The sounds (mixing and editing) were very good. * While it was a unique film compared to most modern Sci-Fi it still failed hard with serious issues, it's similar to a superior title ""District 9"" which i think handled the Alien on earth issue much better with more depth and meaning, also being more enjoyable and with a more unique and ambitious approach.Side Note: I could've went with depth on explanations about the issues but i wanted to avoid spoilers."

I'd hoped for something more like Contact rather than ID4 and was prepared to be captivated by something less crash bang wallop but unfortunately the film was just a little too slow and a little too tedious.I liked the set up of the aliens showing up, the gravity in the ship and the complications with the language but the need for some of the countries to attack felt rushed and more as a device to generate some drama rather than being considered.This was none more demonstrated that the soldiers going rogue. I think in the situation shown in the film, the quality of all personnel on the project would be the best that we could offer. The idea that you'd have a bunch of grunts easily seduced by some webcast to effectively mutiny against their own felt way, way off base. Furthermore the lack of repercussion given to the action rather than a cursory 'some guys went mad' line was just odd.Really, some soldiers decided to plant their own device and endanger our interactions with an alien species and it was just pied off with a line of dialogue, just felt lazy and treated the audience with utter contempt. It really felt like 'oh we need some drama and a ticking clock device. It doesn't make much sense but just put it in anyway'.People simply dismissing it as 'people are crazy' is not a good excuse in my mind. That means a director could introduce a random character in any film to carry out a random action and then have it validated by people saying 'oh people are stupid, didn't you know'.For all the praise that the film is getting, it really was just very average in my opinion."

This is a masterpiece that bright minded people will realize. In every way you look throughout the movie you'll feel a balanced Art behind, The elegance of the story telling is just wonderful. Denis Villeneuve gives a lesson to many other directors that big bold budgeted movies and extravagant ideas are not necessarily essential for a good movie, The movie is deconstructed in a way the mixes reality scenes with past dreams, once sober and once high, It flows between the past and present and that's the beauty of the movie. Human behavior in times of distress is also a major element that pushes the story forward and gives it more meaning. The writer did a great job a by implementing philosophical theories about the subconscious, that made it deep enough to have this amount of brightness. It was visually satisfying and pleasurable to watch, I'm definitely looking forward Denis's next masterpiece."
" Amy Adams provides a stand out performance in this enthralling, grounded sci-fi thriller
",0.1027,0.997,2017-02-15 00:00:00,10,"A beautifully balanced story and a compelling cast, 'Arrival' is a modern sci-fi triumph. It is particularly refreshing in the stance that it is not heavily dependent on special effects or futuristic, bombastic violence, nor too complicated in its thematic approach. Moreover, one may say it is ""down to Earth"", and consistently thrilling, packed with twists and shocks that are not only exhilarating, but also plausible.Amy Adams' character, Dr Louise Banks, is central to the plot, following her inner struggle with an unfamiliar life which she keeps seeing in her mind, and her linguistic talents enlisted by the military after 12 extra-terrestrial spacecraft arrive unexpectedly in different locations across the planet, with her job being to decipher the alien language. The events unfold delightfully, weaving the sci-fi aspect in with the realism seamlessly using flashbacks and visions to deepen the impact of the burden that Banks is undertaking. The distinction between the present and the visions is presented terrifically, subtly hinting at the eventual reveal that ties the whole narrative together, which in itself is magnificent and sincerely awe-inspiring.Director Denis Villeneuve could not have picked a better leading female than Amy Adams, who appropriates the clash between her duties and personal issues with assured naturalism. The audience is very much endorsed in Bank's story, to the point where the aliens themselves are never shown in their full profile until she herself sees them. Most importantly, the film focuses much more on her than it does on the extra-terrestrials, and Adams embraces this wonderfully with her remarkable acting, demonstrating an exterior calmness juxtaposed by a tormented and scarred interior. But as a result of this personal connection, Villeneuve has exceeded expectations in terms of dramatic effect, producing a film that is strangely more relatable than most sci-fi films previously.In addition, the science behind the story is intelligently constructed, leaving few questions out in the open that cannot feasibly be resolved by the explanations given. 'Arrival' is continuously complex yet coherent, primarily due to the strong storytelling provoked by Villeneuve's expressive and mysterious style, seen as well in his former works 'Sicario' and 'Prisoners', which in combination with Eric Heisserer's fluent screenplay (adapted from Ted Chiang's short story 'Story of Your Life') successfully forms an atmospheric and efficacious cinematic experience, making the film believable over anything else, an aspect that the likes of 'Interstellar' ultimately couldn't master.However, most vitally, 'Arrival' doesn't just deal with the influence of aliens on the world, but rather the impact of humanity. It's this precise balance that makes 'Arrival' an absolutely exceptional display; another fascinating film by Villeneuve and one of the greatest sci-fi films of the modern era."

" Great movie; explanation below for those who misunderstand it
",0.3818,0.9649,2017-02-15 00:00:00,10,"I think it's telling that the people who like this movie, really like this movie and those that don't, really don't. From the reviews on this site of those who didn't like the movie, it appears that these people didn't pick up on the plot details and the implications of the plot structure which is the whole point of the story. The movie moves along deceptively slowly; I say ""deceptively"" because the viewer needs to pay attention. There's actually a lot going on and for those mistaking the movie for being slow, will miss out on an intellectual and emotional ride that makes the thoughtful viewer reflect upon their own decisions and relationships.Although I doubt that those who have watched it and thought little of the movie will likely stop and reconsider, never mind go back and read a positive review explaining why the movie's great, I nevertheless feel compelled to explain some of what it is that these negative reviewers missed:{It should go without saying that spoilers abound:}The structure of the movie is jarring at first with scenes of the daughter interspersed with Louise (the main character)'s first contact with the aliens. This structure is intentional and follows the source material faithfully. It's done in both the movie and its source material short story, to highlight that contact with the aliens have affected Louise's thought process so much so that she is in fact (major spoiler and plot point here) ""remembering the future"". What the audience thought at first as a depiction of Louise's past experience with the death of her daughter possibly colouring her interaction with the aliens, is in fact, we find out near the end, instead a memory of her inevitable future. And this answers a number of questions many misunderstanding reviewers point out in disgust, one of which being why the aliens, being obviously more technologically advanced than we are, don't just communicate in our language; in fact this is a major plot point - the reason for the aliens being here on earth is to force humans to learn their language. The entire point of their visit, to spell it out for the clueless, is that by forcing us to learn their language, it forces us to see the universe from their perspective, which ultimately gives humans a similar ability that the aliens have to see into the future. It is their gift to humanity and since Louise immersed herself in their language and therefore gained their ability to see into the future, as demonstrated by the flash-forwards we see from the beginning of the movie, they have succeeded in what they came to earth to achieve. Having achieved what they came here to do, is the reason they leave at the end.The above points brought about some heady realizations and questions for me such as:Knowing that my child would die at a very young age, and with all the growing pains, difficulty of raising a child and aggravation as depicted in the movie (and let's face it, in real life), would I make the decision to have her in the first place? How much do we love our children and would it have been better that they never been born? Is it selfish to have this child knowing she will die before 'full potential' or is this in itself what is selfish, to not have her solely because of my own inevitable heartache?Being bilingual, I have experienced how different languages affect my fundamental thinking. What they implied in the movie that learning and thinking in a different language gives a person a different perspective and even forces a person to think a certain way, from experience, is a real thing. The science fiction part of that is of course, thinking in this new alien language can cause anyone to be able to see the future. Really knowing a different language and how that changes your thought process is an interesting concept that single-lingual people may not realize exists. And maybe for some multi-lingual people, also brings to consciousness that a different language can shape how you view the world. And isn't that part of what makes stories great, the ability to make you experience and realize things that you wouldn't otherwise get to experience?There are other realizations and heady questions arising from this movie. If only people realized these points instead of dismissing liking this movie as a case of pretentiousness of reviewers and intellectuals."

This movie breaks all the rules, and it works beyond belief. First off the movie is about deciphering language, and its extremely tense and interesting. Perhaps the biggest rule it breaks is that it shows you what is going to happen, and then you watch it happen. This movie pulls that off in a way I have never seen and keeps the tension and emotion throughout this process. This is a movie I could go on and on about but this is just a movie that needs to be seen and felt rather than read about. Overall, not only one of the the best movies of the year, this is quite possible THE BEST movie of the year. Clear your schedule and watch this today. I give this an A+."
" Totally stupid.
",-0.5709,-0.5946,2017-02-14 00:00:00,1,"This movie starts out strong and gets dumber and dumber. The science fiction bits are either too magical or too trivial. The characters behave like unrealistic archetypes, apparently because the writers can't think of any realistic way to generate conflict. And the climax and resolution feel like they realized they just have to make something up and jam it in.Much of the movie is empty emo-candy in the same way that Transformers is empty eye-candy. Apparently some people like that nonsense, especially other reviewers.This is an awful movie that's dressed up just enough with good acting and effects so that dumb people are tricked into thinking they've seen a good movie."

Where is the respect with the audience??? who pays that bill... completely empty dialogues, a ET looks like a octopus.... A ship like a cocoon...a nervous army officer... screaming...making scenes.. A complete disaster. The actors involved in this project, Jeremy Rnner, Amy Adams, Forest Whitaker, big stars....on a empty movie. I don't understand why Denis Villeneuve, after great movies, Sicario (2015), Enemy (2013), Prisoners (2013), enter on a fail project like that... I really do not understand. After all, that is a slow movie... very very slow..... Finally, the 8,1 rate.....what ???????"

There were times when the sensation of confusion was such that people at the movies stopped eating popcorn at the same time and there was a dead silence.The plot, totally original never before seen, filled my expectations, moreover, exceeded them, was very credible, as that at any moment could happen an alien visit, and are we really prepared for it?Perhaps the government should think about educating children from an early age so they are prepared for what could happen in a few years, perhaps. Likewise even in the universities would have to teach to the professionals how to deal in a future with a similar situation, just in case it happened."

",0.8271,0.9939,2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"What am I talking about? When you speak very well of a movie, in the end, it seems worse. I was thinking that it was going to happen to me. But no, I thought it was a great movie. At times he reminded me of Terrence Malick or Stanley Kubrick and I must say that for good, since I am not devoted to them. It's a science fiction movie but with a message. Tardas to catch it, for the assembly that has, but this so well carried, that does not bother you.The picture is too dark, so much so that sometimes you do not see the actors face, but still, it fits the movie very well and helps you tell the story.The effects are obviously very well done. This time it can not be said to be a special effects movie, for bad, but rather the other way around.He has his message pacifist, but it is so well told, that you do not mind the message whether you are a supporter of it or not.It is on the edge between the absurd and the great in many moments, but it is so well carried that it surpasses itself and never falls into the absurd.The truth is that I think the direction is good in some aspects, so I have already told. But I also have to say, I do not know why he makes those planes so ugly many times. Why take the actors by the back or side? They are not seen. But it also has a very bearable pace. Counting all the philosophy that it puts to the film, that is difficult.Although I do not like the voice in the movies, I prefer to be told visually, but I have to say, it is very good. I love the hairdresser, of her, as she can show that she is very aware of the work and does not mind that she is undone what has been done in her hair.It has a very good music, to get me to look at the music during the film, is that they have done well. I got into the movie a lot and helped take the film tempo."
" Form over substance to the max
",0.0,0.9608,2017-02-14 00:00:00,3,"I won't try getting the score down as fast as possible so therefore 3/10, the music was quite good, although it didn't match the story. But 8.1?? For this movie?? I love going to IMDb the minute I've watched a movie I hated. And the same pattern emerges every time. You have these 10/10 reviews which read like wannabee magazine reviews and you have the 1/10 honest ones.The 10/10 reviews are either 1. Villeneuve fanboys -""Another masterful piece""-, 2. People who want to be movie reviewers at some magazine or 3. People who are afraid they didn't get the movie and talk in clichés on how ""moving"" and ""emotional"" it was. We can't do anything about point 1 and 2. But to the point 3 people I'd like to say: Don't be afraid, there was nothing to get here. It's pretentious (just like Villeneuve's Sicario) in a way that a lot of people get distracted by form while the substance is totally lacking.In Sicario we discover that the Americans with their war on drugs are actually a huge part of the problem. Really? Wow, that's news to me. In Arrival we're distracted by a loose connection between time, language, personal life and working together as humanity. In this movie, the Americans are the peace keepers of the world, and good old China and Russia are brainless military guys who want to blow up the poor aliens.There's a lot of visiting the aliens and interpreting their splashy new ink language. When I heard the aliens for the first time, I'd hire some whale researcher instead of a language professor who only speaks some Chinese at most. But she deciphers the alien language in a miraculously short amount of time and understands that they're bringing some kind of knowledge, and in return we should help them in 3000 years. With what? We will never know. The male scientist doesn't help us either, he's doing really nothing but staring at computer models without getting to a conclusion so he starts staring at our female professor. Guess what happens in the end!The music was good, but it was distracting as well. The first 30 minutes I thought something evil would happen. Maybe that was the point, but the anti-climax of the entire movie was even worse because of this.My biggest question after reading all these IMDb comments was: Are these 10/10 comments trolls trying to boost the movie's rating? Because I just can't believe how you fill all these plot holes by yourself?"
" Terrific! In the vein of films like Contact
",0.7088,0.9253,2017-02-13 00:00:00,9,"*SPOLIERS* *SPOLIERS* *SPOLIERS* *SPOLIERS*Really a wonderful look into linguistics and how our native language affects and (as the film argues) limits our worldview. Also conceptually reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five. Beautifully shot, and an example of the fact that aliens probably wouldn't all land in NYC or LA or Paris or Giza. The Montana location is truly stunning. The acting is great, and the story moves along quite well for an alien sci-fi film with minimal action. The thoughtfulness that went into the design of the aliens and their society is refreshing (especially as compared to the highly sexualized anthropomorphised aliens in too much fictional media). But it is really the conceptual complexity that left a mark on me. Films that provoke such deep critical thinking are rare, and this stands out. It's also lovely to find one that has big-budget VFX and production value."

" No CGI overkill, just some fine acting and directing
",-0.1027,-0.1074,2017-02-13 00:00:00,9,"Denis Villeneuve is without a doubt an upcoming director and I can't wait to see Blade Runner 2049. Prisoners, Sicario and now Arrival (haven't seen Enemy yet, or some of his earlier work). Denis knows how to capture the tension. It is almost the strongest point of all of his films. Minimal use of computer generated images, and main focus on story, characters, acting and thrilling scenes. Back on IMDb board, I have noticed a lot of people calling Arrival a boring movie. So many hypocrites these days. People trying to point out every possible flaw to look and sound smarter while at the same time hailing far worse movies. Calling it boring and slow while at the same time complaining no originality in Hollywood, only giant CGI laser explosions extravaganza. Go watch Independence Day. In Arrival there is no action, no explosions, just some amazing acting performances combined with good directing, editing and cinematography. There was not a single moment I felt bored."
" Not so great after all
",-0.544,-0.9259,2017-02-13 00:00:00,1,"I was initially very excited about this movie. It started with good opening, pleasant music and intriguing story line. But as the film continues story line starts to fade into prolonged cut scenes and dramatic music as if it was forced to have emotional impact. Film offers very little explanation to the actual story and instead focuses on the philosophic and emotional side and results in lack of sense and conclusion. It is known that many science fiction films tend to be liberate with scientific facts, but this title defies most of the physical laws known to man to such irritable extent. The idea that this picture sells was completely misunderstood by me as a final audience and I was left with a mixed feeling whether this was a waste of time."
" One of the finest sci-fi pictures of the past decade
",0.0,0.2203,2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"Anyone who may be somewhat hesitant to let themselves get too hyped- up about the upcoming sequel to Ridley Scott's sci-fi masterpiece Blade Runner (1982) can now at least be assured that the movie is in the safest hands possible after viewing director Denis Villeneuve's Arrival, one of the most intelligent and thoughtful first contact pictures in recent memory. Arrival's November release date goes some way to indicate the kind of audience the film is going for: just in time for awards season and about as far removed from the CGI-laden destruction-athons that litter the summer as you can get. No monuments are blown to smithereens here, nor does the American President deliver a stirring speech to a chest-thumping crowd. Villeneuve's concerns lie with the necessity to communicate and the strength to be had in unity.Adapted from Ted Chiang's short story Story of Your Life, Arrival begins by establishing the mindset of its heroine Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguist who is in mourning over the loss of her daughter to cancer. During one of her lectures, she is asked to turn on the news, where it is being reported that twelve alien spacecrafts have touched down at seemingly random locations around the world. One of the giant, egg-shaped ships touches down close by in Montana, while others hover mysteriously in the likes of Australia, China and Russia. They don't emit any gas or toxins, and their purpose and intent are frustratingly unclear. Naturally, all hell breaks loose across the globe with looting, violence and plummeting stocks leading the media to dub this an 'alien crisis', and Russia and China becoming increasingly nervous.Having participated in a Farsi translation a couple of years earlier, Louise is brought in by U.S. Army Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to help communicate with the alien beings, along with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). A base has been set up at the Montana location, and Louise quickly establishes contact with the two giant creatures, who Ian dubs Abbott and Costello. They communicate by ejecting a substance from their tentacles, which manifest in circular symbols, each slightly differing from one another. With Weber and CGI Agent Halpern (Michael Stuhlbarg) insisting that time it of the utmost importance, Louise must decipher the alien language and establish the reason for their arrival as other countries do the same, and before an over- eager China strike first without knowing the extra- terrestrials true intentions.Time and non-linearity are central to the film's themes, and Arrival's careful pace and fractured narrative will certainly frustrate anyone hoping to see a traditional alien invasion picture. Screenwriter Eric Heisserer and Villeneuve have much bigger ideas than to have both sides simply blow each other up. The film shares more in common with Contact (1997) and Interstellar (2014); more philosophical and contemplative works of science-fiction that raise the big questions. But this is not two hours of chin-stroking, as Villeneuve repeats his Sicario trick of building a tense atmosphere full of dread and trepidation. The first glimpse of the alien ship is an otherwordly experience, as Johann Johannsson's score blares out horns and deep rumbles, like the song of a whale from another planet. It's all anchored by Adams' terrific, restrained performance, as she channels pain and frustration through her tough, closed-off exterior. One of the finest sci-fi pictures of the past decade, and one that cuts to the very fabric of what it means to be human. The Replicants are surely in safe hands."
" High-level, quality Sci-fi
",0.0,0.9534,2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"This is a beautifully shot movie. The score is perfect as it in itself sounds other-worldly. I wouldn't say there are stand out performances, but they were all solid for the most part. I was impressed with the alien language aspect and the visuals of the creatures and ships. Yes, there is a twist, but it's presented in a realistic way rather than trying to trick you. Forest Whitaker I think was trying to do a Boston accent, but it was hard to tell since he would abandon it altogether from time to time. A great overall message, especially for the current climate. It poses far-reaching questions but leaves room for personal ones as well."
" Beautifully made
",0.5719,0.8326,2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"Arrival is a fantastically smart Sci-Fi film that takes the run-of- the-mill 'Aliens land on Earth' plot and flip it on its head. Amy Adams delivered a masterful performance as a brilliant linguist with what seem like flashbacks of her dying daughter. She is chosen by the US Government to decipher an unknown alien language alongside a physicist named Ian so they can communicate with the one of 12 alien spaceships to figure out their purpose on Earth. As tensions rise around the globe, Louise and Ian are put under tremendous stress to find out why the aliens came to Earth.The setting in Montana gives a stunningly beautiful backdrop for this incredible yet perplexing spacecraft. The environmental CGI is stunning yet just subtle enough to be believable and not distracting from the emotion and story line and the aliens are beautiful and surreal. Their squid like bodies and the way they write is scary and thrilling to watch. Louise's daughters story is heart wrenching as the flashbacks to watch the cut scenes are soft and feel as if you are stepping into a memory rather than seeing what's going to happen in the future. The score is beautiful also. The soft horns really set the mood and filter emotions to you through sound along with the visuals. It is perfectly balanced to enhance the film and to not be overbearing and distracting. The story is so well thought out and unique that every moment captures the audience's attention and keeps them on the edge of their seat wondering what turn is going to be taken next. It keeps you confused and disoriented along with Louise as she tries to fit the puzzle pieces together until it delivers one mind bending yet brilliant plot twist at the end, throwing a wrench into reality itself. There were a few parts that quite seriously irritated me though. Like the fact that a government official thought that a linguist could decipher and alien language from a short recording of a few weird noises. Sorry but not even the US government could be that naive. Also, the bombing of the spaceship literally made no sense to me. There were a couple of others but despite these perplexing events this movie is an incredible watch and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."

" This film made me rethink life, it made me more conscious about life decisions
",0.0,0.9879,2017-02-12 00:00:00,10,"This is my first review here on IMDb, which I hope says a lot, when I made a profile just to write my opinion on this movie. I enjoy movies, I am not someone who is familiar with all the best directors and so on. My review will be based on my opinion, my actual experience watching this movie. Are you a person who likes to think? Simple question, which is hard to know the answer to. If you are curious about whether there is a bigger meaning to life, curious about the very fundamental questions in life in general, or eager to learn if we are alone in this universe, this movie is for you.I know this is only a movie. A well thought through, excellent filmed, perfectly directed, mind-bending, life changing film. This film will not only have you drop a few tears in the end (I have experienced this during max a couple of movies, like We Are Marshall, Interstellar and maybe The Shawshank Redemption), it will have you focus on the important things in life. What is the most important thing in life for most of us? What will we look back at when we are old and memories are all we have left? Like we all (most of us) know, life can, and will be tough to us. We will face challenges that can be hard to deal with, we will experience tragedy, disease, death of a loved one, loneliness, depression and regrets. We think of the future as a period of time where things will hopefully be perfect. We think of it as a period consisting of months, maybe even years where we are completely happy with everything in our lives. In the end though, this is not the truth of what is going to be our future. We life through life day by day, and every day we make choices which help form our next day. That happy, stress-less period of time we think of as our future, is not the future, it is our hope for a better everyday. I do not mean to be harsh here, this is a wonderful thing. It means we stand to make thousands and thousands of choices which can help us achieve our goals, find someone we love, care for our family and do the right things. We know that we will experience some of the things i mentioned above. But we still want to experience it. That's what life is, right? A circle, filled with occasions, good and bad, and choices, hard and easy ones. If we choose to live on for longer than our own human lives, then we can also do so, by letting our sons and daughters carry on our good knowledge, emotions and decisions. This movie emphases all of this. Does it seem irrelevant to write all this? Maybe it is, who am I to say what you think. But this is what I had in my head after watching this movie. Watch it, you will not regret it if you are a ""thinking"" person."
" Alternative view of the world
",0.0,0.991,2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"I like it for the fact that it is using language as a backdrop. I am entertaining myself the concept of understanding of the fourth dimension, which is essentially time itself, will make us capable of maneuvering it. But still, this is an interesting concept itself. Superb acting from the leads and I like the character that she is portraying. After knowing the truth, or you can say the future, she doesn't choose to experiment what will happen if she deliberately tries to change it. Like what other films have been doing, they will try to test the limit of knowing the future. But in this one, she chooses to just embrace it, acknowledging that it is her fate. You might say that she doesn't choose to take hold of her life, but I would contend that with she chooses to enjoy the life as it is. Enjoying every moment there is with the loved one, even when she knows that her husband will leave her and her daughter will die. But that's how everyone's life will end up being, we either leave or die. It is a poignant view of the world, but this might be the best choice after all. She made a choice and she honors it."
" more a curiosity than a drama
",0.0,0.4994,2017-02-12 00:00:00,4,"A complex, and familiar, alien contact science fiction drama that loses much of its punch being crammed into a two hour format. The result is a confusing storyline that rushes to an even more confusing climax and hammy finale. The considerable talent of Amy Adams is wasted, as are those of her supporting cast. Including the aliens. In addition, the big screen production values do not translate well to the small screen. This would have been a much more entertaining and powerful project as a limited run series on one of the subscription services. All that considered, I cannot recommend paying the considerable price of admission at Amazon, or anywhere else really."

In my mind I'd give 9 but I have other of movies I enjoyed more so I don't give 9, but to me this is a very high 8, almost a 9!As for movies like Gravity, I see that many didn't get this movie. To like or dislike a movie is one thing, but if you don't get what a movie is all about you should try to understand that and then re-watch it.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!Amy Adams gives an awesome performance as well as Jeremy Renner. The whole movie is centered on Louise. It takes almost the whole movie to get that she's able to perceive time in a non linear way and that at the end she's the one instrumental to unite Earth.To people saying they didn't get the purpose of the aliens, I don't understand if you watched the movie or not. The point for the aliens was for the world to get together in unity as humans and put aside the differences, it's not that different than Star Trek in that sense (if you don't know what I mean with that, I'm sorry for you, and I suggest to go and watch everything about Star Trek and you'll get what I mean!).If you like movies were you don't completely understand what's going on, this is the one. If you expect some kind of huge CGI movie, don't watch this, but if you like to be surprised and if you have PATIENCE (a lot of reviewer said they died of boredom!) and an open mind (some reviewer seems only able to watch movies where everything is what it seems, and this is NOT like that at all!) you can get this movie and enjoy it!"

There's nothing like the moment when you see the plot developing before its developed, making intelligent connections without being spoon fed. This is a great movie, but for one massive flaw in the plot......SPOILER........why couldn't Abbot and Costello already speak English?, they knew they were going to learn it, that was he whole point of this suicidal visit?...they knew how it was going to pan out for them, why not save them selves time (& life) by conversing in English in the first instance,help the characters out by identifying the dangers on the other side of the glass, adding to the extra layer of intrigue in how A&C knew to speak in the first place.

Mainly because of the reason that it is super-predictable and after first minutes the spectator can easily predict the ending. Despite this fact it is worth of seeing.I have few questions which were not answered in the conclusion of the movie (mentioned below). I admit that the idea of living the life that you know how will end up sounds romantic. But truly, when you know that your husband will separate from you because of your secrets and your first child will die, why not to have more kids and share the truth from the very beginning?Louise could give a birth to Hannah, but she could have 1,2,3... more kids just to be sure that one of them will survive and to be honest to her husband and not to die like an abandoned old woman."

" A great film but viewers should be cautious
",0.2382,0.9955,2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Arrival will be noted as the film of the decade,, ending with a 'shocking twist' that is sure to leave many of the audience shocked. I thought that the film was great, with the exception of some loopholes that are ultimately inevitable in a film of this genre and theme. This film had a great emotional narrative running along the lines of the science fiction line. The acting were brilliant, from Amy Adams to Jeremy Renner all did a fantastic job complimenting each other. I thought that the deep humming music choice was great and set a intense and mysterious undertone. In the first half of the film our main character is attempting to decipher alien language and it was a very intriguing but ambitious attempt from a movie to try and capture this, as well as very ambitious for the characters in the movie. It was a great insight into language and linguistics, however after one point of the film the gears shifts and now the film enters a position where they deal with time, and specifically how time is nonlinear. This is of course the climax of the film however it is also when the steady pacing of the film becomes quite wonky until eventually imploding into one giant release of sorts.Upon understanding that the aliens language and thought of time is nonlinear Amy Adams' character starts to be able to see into the future and we understand that the opening scene of the film depicting her and her daughter were actually from the future. Now this is off putting in some ways, because if you really look into this idea you would find yourself asking the question ""why doesn't she just immediately understand everything?"" and of course the means in which her character stops the other countries to call off their attacks on the 'pods' is extremely sketchy and odd. This film's slower paced first half definitely was an intriguing story while the second half does bring up some questions and plot holes. A friend of mine found this immensely off putting and decided that this completely ruins the film. However as a film I believe that the execution of such complex and theoretical ideas is a good one, the attempt to do so in a narrative fashion is a commendable one, as I have told this friend, ""how else do you expect them to depict a story about nonlinear time within a medium that is one-wayed and linear. Perhaps we are just not ready to take in theories as such that are just not able to be fully grasped by the likes of human as of yet. One thing that I anticipate will be of significance is this influx of positive reviews, this is because this film does a thing that many films are guilty for, they do a big twist ending with a mass implosion and resolution which masks the idea that this is a great film because of this 'wow factor'. In conclusion I would like to recommend this film but do be cautious in terms of falling into this trap and really think about the film as a whole rather than its surprise ending especially when viewing this particular film."
" Ignore the one-star reviews if you're looking for some depth
",-0.3612,0.9735,2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"I'm truly surprised by the number of negative reviews. I felt compelled to create an IMDb account and add my 2 cents to counter the apparent fecal storm in the reviews section.The average moviegoer has been conditioned to expect a certain type of content (look up ""Pavlov's Dogs""). When they don't get it, they are confused. They feel cheated and stupid.Arrival is a movie that indeed delivers on so many different levels. It deals with the practical aspects of extraterrestrial contact. How would one approach an alien and how would one engage in a dialogue with them? Through the protagonist's eyes we can learn about the beauty of the ""human experience."" The audience gets to analyze the situation at hand as the movie progresses. But if you are one of those people that always expects aliens to land on the White House lawn (where such things usually land) and if you expect an instant violent encounter with numerous lasers and explosions, you're out of luck. Please stop expecting this type of content. Arrival is not categorized as an action movie!Why not learn about the Fermi Paradox or the Arecibo message? The movie is so much more than ""some chick translating stuff for two hours."" If you want action and guns, go see something else. If you're looking for intellectual stimulation and if you enjoy a good balance between character development and an eloquently designed story-line, this movie might just be for you.TL;DR: This movie is for smart hombres. If you like building walls, maybe sit this one out."
" Great movie, pointless reviews
",0.6249,0.9304,2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Wow, the reviews on this one.. :) The first on list described the movie as nothing short of a brilliant piece of art, cleverly woven together into pure geniusness. Obviously, people are really trying to sink the ratings as then comes, I'm not exaggerating, 50 rants, 98% of which are undoubtedly written by men, expecting to see Predator, dumping their girlfriends not to ""drown in cheese"", boooooooooooooredom, non- scientific hypothesis, etc, etc, etc. I'm not saying this actually is brilliant art, though I liked it, just suggesting that if under siege or hang over III is all meta you can muster, maybe you should stick this one out : we _do_ understand, you didn't get the movie, you had no interest in it whatsoever to begin with - we don't also need all your texts moping on and on and on and o-o-o-on about it, do we? Movie's great, the story line has an intimate connectedness with the main character that I thought really worked throughout the movie, it maybe even leaves you with something to think about leaving the theater."
" Humanity looking forwards.
",0.0,0.9147,2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"When I watched this the first time I sought the original story. It was part of a short story collection by Ted Chiang called 'Stories of Your Life and Others'. It was the third story and as I write this I have just started it. The first story involves the building of the 'tower of Babylon' and how in ancient times man built a tower that reached Heaven so they could meet Yahweh (God). The second is about people being given an experimental drug that repairs damaged brains, the more damaged the better the outcome, leading to someone becoming 'superintelligent' and what he does with this. The stories lead to positive outcomes for humanity, as does this film. It is a 'soft' sci-fi film that deals with a first contact scenario. As usual the military are heavily involved from the start with their blinkered outlook and paranoid conclusions. It is up to linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to bring understanding and humanity to the fore. I am looking forward to the end of the original story as I am sure you will enjoy this version."

This film was an absolute masterpiece. Throughout the film it hints at the true plot but never quite let's you grasp it until the end which is perfect and heartbreaking in a way. Masterfully written and directed with wonderful turns by the actors this movie won't let you down and kept me thinking long after I watched it. I think the problem with moviegoers these days is that they have been led down a path of microwaved super hero movies loaded with horrible CGI, so they just don't know any better. So when a movie comes along that requires someone to actually watch it you end up with a bunch of clueless people asking ""hey where's Iron Man"". If you enjoy watching original movies with great acting and an actual plot line watch this film you will truly enjoy it."
" Well-crafted and executed
",0.0,0.2444,2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"As often happens, I feel at pains to respond to all the negative reviews I'm reading here...I should first point out that I read the Ted Chiang book that contains the source short story this movie was based upon. The book comes highly recommended, and Chiang doesn't consider himself a science fiction writer.All the elements in the movie are almost exactly the same as in the book. I say this, so as to highlight what some deem as poor alien design. It's always a tricky thing to pull off, especially since there are no confirmed sightings of actual aliens. In my mind, anything goes, but in this case the Heptapods were on the page before the screenplay was written.Again, the dialog, ""Do you want to make a baby?"" is straight from the book. It's explained that this comes after two years of marriage, so it's not intended as a lame pickup line.Someone even had issue with a lack of apparent government involvement. Seriously, do we need another movie with the president making all the actual decisions on screen. Government interaction is implied by means of common sense. We really don't need to see what 11 governments are up to directly. That would be boring.I guess these things were lost in the movie. I tend to enjoy movies that leave some of the story unexplained in detail. Books get away with this with prose and narration, and movies often don't have enough screen time to go into the same level of detail. I tend to turn off my common sense radar for movies like this. First and foremost, it's intended to be entertainment. And, if you're busy sighing and complaining about these elements, you're missing the point of the story."
" Why has film got a 8.1 rating.

We get to understand how hard it must be to communicate with a Alien race and really nothing else, well nothing new anyways. The film is nice to watch, has special effect but which film doesn't nowadays. Possibly the premise of the film is to show the world how we humans are not just to one another but to all creatures. But we've been like this for thousands of years so that's not anything new. It was very fortunate that the film introduce the concept of nonlinear time as a gift to humanity so now we can go on living as we do. doing all the things we do but doing it indefinitely. Does that seem like real fun, I don't think so."
" May be frustrating for scientists, engineers, or linguists. 1997 ""Contact"" a much better film.
",0.0,0.9927,2017-02-11 00:00:00,4,"I just watched ""The Arrival"" with super-high expectations, but I must say I was disappointed. It's a step in the right direction for sure, an examination of extra-terrestrial life as being curious and peaceful rather than hostile... but the whole deal with all the different languages made me frustrated and unsettled. Not to mention, Hollywood has a tough time getting away from military depictions of human reason; namely... ""if we don't understand it, we must attack it"". This is just stupid, humans know when we are outclassed technologically and if not threatened with extreme force, we would never initiate the first attack.To think that a SUPER ADVANCED alien civilization would travel the cosmos and contact us is not a super far-fetched idea. Not likely that any of us will live to see that time, and most likely, we will be in space discovering other species first...Here is my problem with the movie: Are we really to believe that a super-advanced species made such a long trip to contact us, but left the problem of communication to the responsibility of the lesser- developed primitive species? This super advanced alien race with all of its technology was unable to observe and study us before making contact? If the goal of this alien race TRULY was to help humans rather then total annihilation, then wouldn't it make sense that the more advanced culture make an effort to find a means of communicating with the less advanced one?Later on in the movie, the main actress was communicating to the aliens with English, then subsequently reading the alien language and understanding the messages, after only being able to study the language for a couple of days or so. Meh... Wasn't really an alien movie as much as it was a romance flick with an emphasis on communication...MORE FRUSTRATIONS:The ""written language"" of the aliens was EXTREMELY INEFFICIENT. Much like Mandarin, it had a unique and overly-complex symbol for every new word. Any advanced alien civilization would have a base alphabet of simple symbols, which in combination with one other, make words. This is the most practical way to convey information as it does not compound exponentially and does not require each individual to memorize thousands of unique shapes (like obsolete Mandarin). Any idiot can make something that's complex. It takes a genius to make something simple. I would hope to give the aliens the benefit of the doubt with their advanced technology and assume that they are not ""idiots"".I liked the 1999's ""Contact"" version of the alien language better. It introduced an unprecedented and innovative twist on written language, building up information on a 3-dimensional medium rather than what we are used to, writing and messages being passed on a 2- dimensional medium.This was an exciting and alternative twist on alien communication which actually made sense and had practicality. Technically you could pack much more information in a 3-dimensional space versus a 2- dimensional plane, so the writers got it JUST right.The ""Arrival"" writers are either lazy or incapable of thinking about things holistically and with a scientific principle. Their version of ""alien language"" had no clever or innovative twist, but rather opted out for some elaborately-drawn shapes which have no business being used as language. Just a bunch of fancy ring-shaped splashes of ink, with an excess of detail to each shape which would distract from the message and promote miscommunication. A lazy design, to be sure, done by some low-level intern who did their best to create something which appears completely foreign to us... but what they ended up with is something which would never realistically be used.The movie was better than most blockbusters representing alien visits, but we still have a long way to go before making movies which both entertain the masses and satisfy the more practical viewers who desire realism."
" Quite possibly the dumbest movie ever
",-0.552,0.9409,2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"The entire premise of this movie is idiotic. The aliens, fine, great, I can watch this. But as soon as you threw in what is essentially time travel the entire movies premise completely falls apart. Why? 1. The Aliens come all the way to earth because they will need our help in the future so they give us the ability to 'think' like them to see time as a whole.If that's the case, then you'd think the aliens would have 3000 years to figure out how to handle whatever it was they needed help with wouldn't you? 2. The entire premise of the movie is figuring out how to communicate with them. That said, if they aliens could think into the future they'd already know how to speak English before they got here as they could have just jump their minds into the future and already known how to speak it. Dumb.I could go on and on but this movie speaks for itself. I want the 2 hours of my life I spent watching this piece of garbage back."

The message is hard to understand at first. It makes you keep thinking, and thinking again. Then you may end up not fully understand as well.I am sure that is not a watch and forget movie for a quick entertainment, but will let you something in your mind, to think, to talk about it, to discuss with your fellow nerds. Highly recommended."
" Odd but Fascinating Circularity
",0.6249,0.9703,2017-02-11 00:00:00,6,"I believe ""Arrival"" attracts a very specific portion of public; the group I have in mind comprehends sci-fi fans, of course, but also includes ""skeptical"" viewers. By that I mean those who are vaguely interested in the indefinite flavor of Curiosity which derives from mysterious or catastrophic movies.The movie, being meant for these two categories, presents a bipartite content : partially, it portrays the classic elements of science fiction (meeting with the Unknown, interaction with it, subsequent change in the protagonist's life). Furthermore, ""Arrival"" presents wider themes: Love, Destiny, Acceptance. This hybrid nature catches the attention of both kinds of typical viewers, but for different reasons; sci-fi fans might be on the search for intergalactic conflicts, time travel, display of alien technology. The neutral viewers, instead, are presumably interested in witnessing hypothetical apocalyptic scenarios and the personal development of the characters. Well, they both get a taste of what they seek. ""Arrival"" is in fact a rich plate which satiates every kind of appetite and leaves no complaints behind.The true question however is : is this fictional hunger fully and completely satisfied? The answer is a matter of opinions; mine is negative. The picturesque alien race isn't clearly and exhaustively described or disclosed, as well as their final inscrutable purposes; I believe others in the audience share my same desire to know more of these mighty ""heptapods"". But I guess that was the goal of the authors; if so, mission accomplished."
" another encounter of the third kind
",0.5267,0.9931,2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Almost every season of American cinema in this period brings about at least one big sci-fi production. While in recent years the themes dealt with space exploration within Earth orbit ( 'Gravity' in 2013 directed by Alfonso Cuaron Sandra Bullock and starring George Clooney ) or the planets of our solar system (Ridley Scott's 'The Martian' with Matt Damon last year), 'Arrival' this year returns (as 'Interstellar' by Christopher Nolan, also starring Matt Damon in the title role of 2014) to one of the themes of most popular in the classical literature and film of the genre and namely contact with extra terrestrial civilizations and possible visits and even invasion of our planet by representatives of civilizations more advanced than ours. What can bring new another movie in a genre so popular and populated with significant creations, with branches in all genres from science fiction and apocalyptic visions to technological sparkling comedies and fairy tales that turn extra-terrestrial beings in friendly issues and the films in family-friendly productions? 'Arrival' managed to generate interest because it follows two of the basic rules of success in this sub-genre of science fiction. The first is that a film of 'first contact' must have the focus or pay significant space to humans and their real problems, must have heroes in flesh and blood, with whom viewers can identify. Dennis Villeneuve's film has as the main heroine Louise Banks, a beautiful woman but passed beyond the first youth who has just gone through the terrible trauma of losing a child to an incurable disease. The beginning of the film looks more like the beginning of a psychological drama about post-trauma recovery, and this is what this film is actually in some way. But of course, Louise Banks is a doctor in linguistics and because of this expertise is involved in trying to communicate with the passengers of the 12 spacecraft suddenly appeared in sight of earthlings. Intervenes here second compulsory element in the success of the genre which requires the contact between civilizations to combine in suitable doses the mystery and anguish human contact with the unknown and an explanation which has sufficient scientific logic (or humor or poetry, in other films ) to satisfy curiosity but also to stay with the audience after the film. Here lies the secret of the interest and success of the film.From here starts but actually the most difficult part. For us, people (scientists or movie viewers), imagination is the only tool that we have at hand to imagine how the inhabitants of other planets physically look. Dreams and nightmares may take the forms, but the filmmakers have a duty to bring the extra-terrestrial on-screen, to shape dreams and imagination. Many movie genre filmmakers often failed, because when dreams becomes concrete substance, interest and expectations often melt into disappointment. You can not say that in 'Arrival' this issue is resolved, rather it is avoided or marginalized in style. Extra-terrestrial in Villeneuve's film are seven-legged creatures looking like octopuses, but to relieve the feeling of revulsion or physical danger there always is a screen between them and people. Viewers' attention is directed to the central theme of the film which is the possibility or impossibility of dialogue between civilizations that can be very different in their biological characteristics and stages of development and therefore use highly specific media each.The main question the heroes in 'Arrival' are faced with is related to the intentions of the extra-terrestrials. To judge them in the image, likeness and intentions of humanity can be a fatal mistake. But ignorance can be fatal and potential hazards are present. Why did the extra-terrestrials come on our planet? What are their intentions? Cooperation or exploration, or conversely, the monopolization of resources (which ones?) on our planet and maybe annihilation? How can be established communication with them, how can their messages be translated when the bases are unknown language they use and even fundamental pillars of their way of thinking are different? I will not give too much detail because I do not want to take away from the joy of watching a film that I recommend to everyone. Of course, the lead heroine plays a key role in the solution of the problem and the answer will come in the end and is related to her biography and traumas that had she went through.The film is based on a story by writer Ted Chiang, winner of the Nebula Award, one of the most important distinctions of genre, in 2000. The text addresses many aspects of the theory of language, perception of time and determinism underlying human communication, and develops a principle known in linguistics and epistemology as the 'Sapir-Whorf hypothesis' or 'relativity language', after which language determines or at least influences the way of thinking, knowledge, and the decision-making of those who use it. Screenwriter Eric Heisserer and director Dennis Villeneuve found screen equivalents to some of the ideas of the story and added further elements, some more successful (i.e. the very credible 'international' response the arrival of extra-terrestrials) other less to my taste (resolving at the last moment the inter-civilization the crisis that is on the brink of armed conflict seemed too 'Hollywood-ish'). The film's graphics solutions for the relations between civilizations at first contact are well suited and exceptionally aesthetic. There are too many details in this film about extra-terrestrial technology, and about the secrets that they want to transmit to mankind, and all these make this movie worth seeing."
" A good'ish SCI-FI movie, was a bit disappointed.
",-0.4767,0.8808,2017-02-10 00:00:00,8,"I really like Denis Villeneuve as an director and he has done some movies I loved: Prisoners, Enemy. So I was really hyped to see him direct a serious sci-fi movie, but I was a bit disappointed with the end product.SPOILERS!!!!Positives: The acting by the two main leads were really good. Amy Adams is always great and I was surprised how good Jeremy Renner was. It's a really well shot movie with striking visuals (one poor cgi shot) and images that won't at least leave my head in a while. Soundtrack was also really good.Negatives: ""How about we just talk to them before we start throwing math problems at them?"" When I heard that line in the first act of the movie I was like OH NO! That's precisely what you should do when you are trying to communicate with an alien civilization. Use a common language: MATH! Start with the prime numbers and build from there. Use simple calculus with pictures: one line plus one line equals 2 lines. But that's just my personal gripe with the movie, but it buggered me so much because I was expecting a hard science fiction movie. The 2nd biggest problem I had was the stereotypical military guys who are just basically shoot first think later type's and are unwilling to listen reason. ""Let's not communicate with the other landing sites"",""Radio silence!"",""Let's not share our information because nobody shares theirs!"" Like WTF?! are these people in kindergarten or what?Overall Arrival is an enjoyable watch with your typical Hollywood contrivance that left me wanting something more serious on the science front."

The suspense for me felt high throughout, probably as a result of said atmospheric music and all of the smoke on screen. But nothing really happened in the film that I can remember.I wanted to like this, but I can't possibly think of a reason to watch it again or recommend it and now I'm just filling the minimum 10 lines of text so that the last few minutes haven't been even more time wasted.

This move is about one particular character and its tough choices. Its highly focused inside, not outside. Its highly emotional. It would be better if you have a child, if not try imagine how it'll be to have one. How would you fill to your son/daughter.If you have problems putting Sci-Fi title near one of sentences above - you could dislike this film. If you think some of the sentences above are boring - you could dislike this film. Like a tone of people with 1 star. I have read 9 pages of frustration and almost every review you could sort to one of the categories: 1. It's not an action. Where are my booms and shooting? - It's not about shooting, you can get it right from the trailer. 2. Its boring. Someones drama is not a valid Sci- Fi move for me. - OK, it happens. Pass by. 3. It has numerous mistakes. - This guys just missed some plot twist while going pee may be. 4. It's no technically accurate. - If it would be absolutely technically accurate then we would have the alien tech, and it'll be documentary film - not a Sci-Fi.If you are OK with my 5 prerequisites then with a high probability you will love this film very much, as i do.

First impressions is key and this movie starts with scene that you might find unimportant. But hold your breath, every single scene is interconnected. It's so damn brilliant!! The moral lesson of the movie is something else, in fact, it's everyone's dream.The acting is beyond perfect, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whitaker is breathtaking. They've done a really really well job which makes you immerse in the experience. I've watched so many movies and I was almost convinced that modern movies are terrible. Until I watched this movie. This is the best movie I watched since 2015. Period.For those who rated this movie have something in common, THEY DIDN'T WATCH IT TILL THE END. If you sit in a place where there are people who aren't really fans of movies or science fiction. And they start commenting on every single detail, it will ruin the movie. I believe you guys should watch the movie again, and ALONE. Focus on the meaning behind it. Stop arguing whether Aliens should look like a certain figure, or whether the physics are possible. Writers aren't scientists, but they are good at speaking to our souls. If you are smart enough, you will be able to detect the message."
" Fantastic movie!
",0.5983,0.7619,2017-02-10 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie where you have to use your brain and think. It's quite clear from seeing the bad reviews left by some people here that using ones brain is something not everyone is equally good at. Some people have a very short attention span, and they want to see things blown up instantly. It doesn't matter how huge the plot holes are, as long as there's mindless action all the time, they are happy and will give the movie 10. I can tell you this, this is not an action packed action movie filled with plot holes. It's a scifi thriller playing mind games with you. Once you get it, you'll love this movie. Too bad a lot of people who just didn't get it are spoiling the ratings by giving a low score. Disregard them. Because someone didn't get the movie doesn't mean that you won't. It's like asking a blind person how it looks. He'll say it doesn't look great. Don't take his word for it! Have a look for yourself. This movie is not like independence day, which is quite predictable. The stupid aliens arrive with their technology which is 1000 times more advanced than ours, yet we manage to defeat them easily..This movie reflects a more realistic scenario on things would ACTUALLY play out if we met a species that is so much more advanced than us, and so fundamentally different in every way. How would we communicate? How would communication work? Just look at how easily we misunderstand each other. How can we expect to make any sense of an alien race? This movie is brilliantly thought out. You have to pay close attention at all times, as it gives you small clues that you'll need to put it all together towards the end. Then it'll make sense, and you will be left astonished by this movie! One of the best movies so far this year. Highly recommended! If you like scifi movies that are not shallow, this is the movie for you!"
" Hollywood CAN do good Science Fiction after all.
",0.4404,0.9698,2017-02-10 00:00:00,10,"After the last big Sci-Fi movie with a lot of hype around it, i almost lost hope i would ever see Hollywood master the genre. Interstellar was big, flashy, bombastic, but terrible Science Fiction. Big chunky robots with CRT-monitors in their belly extending their blocky arms to handle the joystick of a spacecraft: It was exemplary of Hollywood's total incompetence when it came to Science Fiction.Now comes Arrival, and it does everything oh so right, that i expected to go oh so wrong once again.The movie sacrifices none of the human element a big production needs, but excels at a premise that does not require writers struggling to understand Machine Intelligence or actors losing themselves in techno-babble.The star for once, and this is Arrival's greatest trick, is not the computer, not the scientist, but... a linguist.While so many other movies failed ultimately exploring the world, the technology they propose, Arrival faces no such struggle because the scenario is now, the alien elements truly alien, not human-made, and the star something writers feel much more at home with: Language.This movie demonstrates how self-aware the makers were of the trouble Science Fiction was in, and elegantly solves the classic Hollywood problems with a brilliant script. Note needs to be made of two more things: First, the visual design of spaceships and aliens. Not revolutionary in idea, but so clean and haunting in execution, every shot exactly as it must be, that these invaders will stay in memory for some time to come. Secondly, the lead actress, Amy Adams. At no point does she appear a superhuman hero destined to save the world (although she quite definitely is). The subtle ways she manages to show fear and flaws deserves recognition.Arrival is the best science fiction to come out of Hollywood in some time, and i could not be more glad at how positively the genre was boosted by this achievement."
" An inspiring and thought-provoking sci-fi
",0.4215,0.9983,2017-02-10 00:00:00,8,"""If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?"". You may have come across this question before but never has it been so relevant as in Denis Villeneuve's latest sci-fi film, an exciting picture that explores a wide variety of topics including time-travel, extra-terrestrial life and linguistics. Arrival aims to inspire and challenge the audience and it does so very well.Eric Heisserer had been trying for years to adapt the Nubella winner novella ""Story of your life"" by Ted Chiang. As of 2012, he had almost given up and the screenplay found its way in ""The Black List"", a collection of the best unproduced screenplays. Fortunately for all of us, Denis Villeneuve got an interest in it and the result was one of the best director/writer pairings of the year. The main character is Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguistics professor who is hired by the US military who are trying to translate the language of some unidentifiable beings that have apparently come from another place in the universe in twelve mysterious spacecrafts.Political tension grows all over the planet as the aliens' purpose is unknown and their only way of communicating is an incomprehensible writing. Teamed up with physics professor Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Louise must find a way to decipher the bewildering writing before the situation gets out of hand as nations all over the world start to face the spacecrafts with hostility.Denis Villeneuve proves again that he is one of the most exciting directors working now in Hollywood. The directing is top-notch and combined with Bradford Young's cinematography and Jóhann Jóhannsson's score we have an excellently paced, visually stunning and deeply affecting feature. To top it all, Amy Adams gives an extraordinary performance. The absence of her name in the Best Leading actress Oscar nominations is probably the single most shocking snub of the year. She is absolutely stunning in this one. I could almost feel nausea myself when I first saw her in that suit. The reason why Arrival works is that it tackles so many matters without offering a specific take on them. Everything is left to the audience. How should humanity tackle a possible alien approach? How important is language in our way of perceiving our nature? What would we change if we knew the future? I don't even dare to put myself in Louise's place. I can't tell if she made the right or wrong decision and the film won't tell you either. What else is remarkable about Arrival is how thoroughly it was researched scientifically. Several scientists, especially linguists, were approached to give their consult and this is what gives the film a realistic tone and solid background. If there is one thing that I didn't like was the confrontation with the ""Bootstrap Paradox"". This is when a future and a present action are both caused by one another without a logical explanation of how this cycle started. It's actually common among sci-fi films that deal with time travel, but it always feels irritating to me. Interstellar, Minority Report and Donnie Darko are just some of the titles. The paradox even has its own film titled Predestination. Fortunately, it's not so important in the plot of this film.In summary, Arrival is an outstanding picture and I was delighted to know that it was nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cinematography. I repeat it's a shame Amy Adams was snubbed. It's good to know that films like these are produced in Hollywood and can't wait to see Villeneuve's next feature, the long-awaited Blade Runner sequel. He has showcased better than ever what he is capable of with Arrival and I really hope he continues to do what he knows best.More reviews on https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com/"
" Easy review
",0.4404,-0.1546,2017-02-10 00:00:00,6,"I watched this movie last month.The reason I chose Arrival was because of Amy Adams.The story begins with Amy Adams character working as a linguistics professor in a university.Then, UFOs arrive at the Earth.After that, she was approached by a high-ranking army officer.The US government wanted her to communicate with the aliens. The cast of this movie is okay.The cinematography is quite interesting.The editing is rather confusing for me because of the flashbacks.The special effects didn't impress me.I found the movie a little bit slow.In conclusion, I think this movie is more drama than sci-fi.This movie is quite plodding and didn't hold my attention."

" Most Boring Movie Ever!
",-0.4376,0.3751,2017-02-09 00:00:00,2,"Just finished Arrival last night and as a fan of Close Encounters of a Third Kind and other similar type films I can say Arrival was and will be a waste of most people's time. I understood the ending and everything that led up to it, it in no way deserved the production money it took to make this bore fest. And forget about the bad writing, lack of excitement or suspense, what a waste of talent! Good and great actors at least the main three characters just wasted on a slow uneventful overrated film. Where this overall 8 plus stars rating comes from I am clueless. Don't waste money or time on this one, its a bought movie in my collection I will never watch again. Watch a good film like Close Encounters, much older but light years better. What a huge disappointment this film is."
" Save your precious time, don't watch it again
",0.7845,0.9741,2017-02-09 00:00:00,6,"Indeed, is a Great UFO movie and gain world wide attention. But i rather watch the movie ""Sign"" again than watch this movie again. OK, let get summary about this movie. For me i watch completely finish i still confuse the flash back and the future scene. Really confusing, i not sure she single or divorce . Still i have no clue. I know she a Professor of language. Something like that and acknowledge by High ranking military forces. She a well known master of language previous help USA military forces decipher some unknown language before. So she and a handsome guy from Marval avenger act as ""Hawkeye"" team up mission finding clue ""What the purpose this 12 UFO on this earth?"" OK, so why i give bad rating because no worth value watching again. Wasting time, it is better watch new movie. I think this movie boost it movie rating because that guy who act as ""Hawkeye"". Lastly, this movie taught people that human being love ""MISUNDERSTANDING""."
" Heard it was good, it was.
",0.4404,0.9887,2017-02-08 00:00:00,9,"I was aware of the hype around this film with the Oscar nods(or lack of in Any Adams case). Films in the past have let me down on this but Arrival didn't. A different kind of 'Extra-terrestrial' film in my eyes but I may have been blinded by a feeling this would end up like some sort of poor mans Independence Day. Not a huge amount of what I'd call 'guns and glory' action but it still felt really exciting. This was tempered excellently with the slower moving, subdued and sad scenes. The storyline was well crafted, kept me really engaged throughout and the crescendo was really clever and thought provoking. Rightly so Amy Adams has had some plaudits as she was excellent throughout but I loved Jeremy Renners contribution and thought it played a huge part in making Adams character. Has to be said I love Forest Whitaker as I've had a soft spot for him ever since Blood Sport!! This film is more than worth a watch and I would struggle to see how anyone wouldn't enjoy it!!"
" A funny movie, then sleepy movie
",0.4404,0.9703,2017-02-08 00:00:00,1,"Definitely over-hyped. There are just too many holes in this movie to list them here. I think the best part of the movie, because it made me laugh out loud, is when Amy Adams says referring to the ink stains on the glass ""Those are their names, they have names""...HA!HA! And they proceed to name them Abbot and Costello!! HA!! Later on in the movie, the subtitles have the aliens referring themselves as Abbott and Costello too!! HA!! After that I fell asleep, twice, trying to watch this snooze fest. I think this movie is useful in that sense though, if you're having trouble sleeping at home, rent it or buy the DVD. Then if you have friends that suffer from insomnia, recommend this movie to them for sure."
" Very emotional film: Wouldn't call it Sci-Fi
",0.2247,0.5074,2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"How do I start a review of this film? This film really hit me, in all likelihood because I've recently suffered a loss of a loved one.The whole premise of this film is about changing the way you perceive and think: From the attitude towards 'aliens' to our concept of time.If you struggle with movies in which you have to think to watch or want a fast paced alien movie, this isn't your film. This is a far more emotionally deep story about a woman who realizes that the aliens she has been brought to communicate with have been showing her glimpses of her future, not her past.Even in the beginning, you can sort of have an idea that something isn't following a time-line, and that is a constant in the film: Which, I would argue loses viewers because it IS confusing. The short story followed a much more linear concept of time despite the fact the story-line is about following none linear time.OK, quick lesson on time: We are taught from day one, that time begins and ends. We are born, we grow, we live, we die. That is linear time. None linear time concepts follow a theory that time is occurring simultaneously on different planes. Meaning, 1988 and 2088 are occurring along with right now, 2017. Ever have dejavu? The concept of this by theorists is that, with none linear time, these different time periods can eventually 'catch up' up to each other, thus crossing over at a split second in time, causing you to feel like ""I've done this before'.That's just one theory.This is a risky film---this and Interstellar are working on intense theories and concepts that most people likely chose not to pursue in education--and trying to condense that knowledge in a 5 minute crash course of a Hollywood film can get lost--and it does in Arrival. The actual science is theory, aside from the linguistic aspects, and furthermore, there IS a pacing issue. It does get VERY slow--for a reason mind you--but I found this to start getting a bit tiresome. It was almost as if something had been edited out in post production.This is more of an emotional drama about living life, and experiencing all of it: The joy, the heartache, the love, the loss-- -and if you knew your life in advance, would you still choose to follow that same path.I really liked this movie, despite how emotional it made me. If you've recently suffered a loss of a dear loved one, you might want to put this film on hold---it does hit you hard."
" The Arrival is an entertaining well made film, until you get to the ending.
",0.6124,0.9297,2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,"The First thing that i like in the movie is that i like the depiction of the aliens. How they tried to interact with them using a certain language. I was trying to imagine that perhaps if this scenario happens in real life we would be facing similar problems. I also like the mystery in trying to understand their language and i felt that part was executed well and the cast were outstanding.What i don't like however is that on paper the story is very thin and it lacks substance. What i like most about the film about the aliens weren't as fleshed out as i would like to know more about them and their predicament after 3000 years as they said. Near the end, it feels like it was rushed and that the time-travelling part was quite out of place. It felt like it was a cheap way of using deus ex machina in order to put the protagonists role in the story..I enjoyed the movie for the most part. The problem is that i don't think this movie gives much depth or lesson to begin nor does the interesting portrayal of the aliens redeem the terrible excuse of the ending this movie has."
" 8.1? maybe -8.1
",0.0,0.9219,2017-02-08 00:00:00,1,"This movie was beyond awful. I never seen a SF movie as laughable as this. How is this movie rated as 8.1 is beyond me. How some people find this movie good is also beyond me. Some many plot holes in this one and ludicrous situations. The aliens looking like two giant black squids! Really? If there were higher beings in the universe they would for sure be a form of pure energy communicating through telepathy, not looking like a stupid and inconfortable squid. Also this movie is very boring, I found it very hard not to be distracted and pause it to fetch some food or water some plants in the meantime. Thanks god I watched at home and didn't pay for it. The end as well was very unsatisfactory and didn't explain the plot. The aliens came and went without any real explanations as why."

Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good.

" Boooooring!!!
",0.0,-0.3242,2017-02-07 00:00:00,1,"Tried to watch this movie 3 times now. Fell asleep every single time. The pace is ssssssoooooo sssslllooooooooowwwwwwww... The music finally puts you to sleep.I don't understand the hype and the good reviews.. I fell for it and went to the movies to see it because critics were promising this was the next Contact, which is one of my favourite movies of all time... ...not even close!The promise if the movie is that Aliens come to Earth to teach us their language (but somehow they can read ours, even though they don't say so). Supposedly, by learning their language, humans will be able to predict the future... OK, but it's pointless, because even though Louise, the main character, can predict the future, she cannot save her marriage or her dying daughter that doesn't exist yet... ugh... and the worst part is that from the moment when you realize that the visions she's having are from the future, about halfway thru the movie, the whole rest of the movie is pointless. When you get to the end, when they ACTUALLY tell you she can see the future, you're like ""That's it? I already knew that"". The end.huh?"
" This movie will blow your mind...
",0.0,0.9629,2017-02-07 00:00:00,10,"...If you go in with the right mindset. A friend with similar taste to mine recommended the movie. Did not see a trailer. Did not read up on it. Simply downloaded it after reading the brief synopsis at the top of the IMDb page and that was it.The movie had me gripped from start to finish. PLEASE DO NOT read or let alone believe all the super negative and near insulting bad reviews on IMDb. I stopped reading them very quickly as the movie is by no means perfect, but that's only when you look at the smallest details. Don't even remember the last when I wrote a review on IMDb, but after seeing so much negative nonsense in the reviews here, I felt compelled to write my own.The acting, the pace, the visual design and the climax unfolding already way before the film ends was amazing. Normally you get the ""aha"" moment at the very end leaving you with the credits to reflect on it.. This movie slowly started to unfold in a nice pace and then as you get the ""aha"" moment it plays out beautifully right to the very end. Definitely one of the most original and highly unusual sci-fi movies I've ever watched since Interstellar."
" For the first time in a very long time I am wholly satisfied
",0.4215,0.9855,2017-02-07 00:00:00,9,"For me, this film is so groundbreaking and profoundly moving that it doesn't require a lengthy review. Indeed, for me, no review could really do it justice. Suffice it to say that when a film is as brilliantly crafted as Arrival, it articulates itself so acutely that it renders potential reviewers capable of little more than diluting its purity and thus, ultimately doing it a disservice. In my humble opinion Arrival hits the spot on a multiplicity of levels. Examining as it does an experience of alien/human interaction in a fashion that is; innovative, plausible, thought provoking, inspiring and completely moving. Nothing is perfect, and Arrival certainly avails itself of the proverbial 'poetic license' but believe me, as a viewer you won't care one iota about that. We are, after all, talking science fiction here.... how true to life, accurately scientific and technically robust can a film grounded in beguiling fantasy really be? Take it for what it is, Sci Fi at its very, very best and you most certainly won't be disappointed. A sci fi masterpiece to top all others this century so far....."

The only good thing this movie has done is confirmed our decisions that several of the 'professional' critics (and those offering Oscar recommendations) about whom we were skeptical are, indeed, either incompetent or taking backhanders from someone or some place, and have blacklisted them. How anyone with wide-ranging movie experience and even average intelligence can think this is a good movie beats us. Books can do leaps forward and backward in time easily, movies have to be more adept....the efforts on this movie are abject failures, and only add to confusion in what is a poorly and boringly slowly presented plot. Far too many leaps of faith. Even the cinematography is poor.Oscar nominations (among others) for cinematography and film editing. What???"

Why? **SPOILER** First, there is this ARRIVAL of the aliens and Louise Banks was one of the best translator or whatever they need. Then so many thing happens like there is first you think it's flashback but it's not I will tell that later. The mystery here is what is that flashback, who is the father the daughter(Hannah) saying. But even it's not the end, I could tell it's Ian Donnelly so that breaks the mystery(- points there). The butterfly effect doesn't apply :), how the hell she knows what to say to General Shang if she doesn't know it after all. She just gain the information after going to the future. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN IF SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY? Then the mystery of there is Daughter that first you think it's flashback that was later it was the future that she was seeing that was not necessary need to be hidden all the time if the mystery was who is the father? And there are questions un-answered, why the alien visits the earth if they just want to tell that Louise has the gift or whatever, seriously? And Forest Whitaker as cast is a bait!!!!"

" Astounding film
",0.4215,0.9665,2017-02-06 00:00:00,9,"The film was amazing, seeing it in theaters made the sounds even better and gets the audience so immersed in it. It was very clever to put the end of the film at the beginning, that was something I personally could never had guessed without the foreshadowing of the child's art. The message it imposes is also very meaningful and really says something about society. I would say this is one of the best films of the year. The coloring was decent, it had a tone of light blue and grey which is fine, not really my style but it fits the movie. The realistic aspects such as chaos within cities and countries communicating was very well done. The only thing is that there was no president in the film at all which could be seen as a good thing as the cliché presidents are usually very cheesy and stereotypical. Overall, amazing movie and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good film."
" Worth a watch,many things wrong with it, interesting concept but not a decent story.

There is an emotional engagement so they at least got that right and that's what the went for.Feels.The cinematography isn't decent. The sci-fi part is less than mediocre.This movie tried to be something that its not but it mostly failed to deliver. You can detect the ideological bias too so -1 for bringing politics to the game.I can even imagine what would happen if they treated other countries like they treated china and Russian in this one. I believe fiction needs no limitations and Im just holding them to their own standards for the fun of it.

I don't watch many movies anymore, cause every time i do i regret it. This movie was one more in the pile. Now this was a really bad movie. After watching the thing for two hours, i am still wondering if there was a story somewhere in there. Believe me, there was not.Even if you bypass the pointless story, the terrible acting, the non existing special effects, etc. the worst part for me is that, since the whole movie is about the language and communicating with the aliens, so we can find out why they ""arrived"", they are advanced technologically enough to get here, but not enough to speak our language and yet, we manage eventually to speak theirs. Take that you alien freaks!Don't waste your time with this snore-fest."
" A political vessel.
",0.0,-0.975,2017-02-06 00:00:00,2,This movie was made to pander to the marxist influenced mindset where the world is upside down. They have entered the space ship and are now walking on the walls and seeing things differently then normal sane people. Their twisted beliefs explain why they are so easily triggered and aggressive in their response to communication.They believe that words and imagination are as real as actions carried out. A verbal insult can therefore be met with punch to the face because in their mind a word is equivalent to a physical action.They also have twisted the idea of inciting riots and aggression and flipped it on its head. Rhetoric to incite a riot traditionally means that you incite your own supporters to riot and perform aggressive acts. In the marxist mindset the definition is the opposite and they will riot against you for holding a speech and then put the blame on you for inciting their riot.Because of their twisted idea of reality they find it completely plausible that a group of soldiers would carry out a terrorist attack against something that is harmless because that is exactly what they would do in response to being vocally triggered.
" Great philosophy, good sci-fi, atrocious drama
",0.7906,0.9926,2017-02-06 00:00:00,7,"Some language professor named Louise is visited by some military guy after 12 alien spaceships arrive and hover a couple of yards above ground on different places around the world like Montana, Russia, China, Venezuela.He presents her with some recording of the alien language and asks her what she makes of it. Of course she doesn't make anything of it. He leaves planning to visit some other professor. Eventually she's hired for the gig of deciphering the alien language together with with scientist Ian.Up the spaceship they go toward something like a large window. On the other side is fog/mist. Eventually 2 aliens appear. Humans call them heptopods for their seven legs. After the aliens warm up to our team, they release some foggy black ink that turns into shapes. The humans conclude it's their actual language not the sounds they make. The shapes are mostly rings with various blots in different places and eventually the humans more or less figure out the what they mean.At first the humans from the 12 countries are working together. But since all these countries are run by neocon nutjobs who are ready to wage war at any moment, things get more complicated. Info is leaked to the media about what happens during the encounters with the aliens.At some point the aliens appear to write the word ""weapon."" That makes China go crazy and cooperation between the countries is stopped altogether. The US military too takes more aggressive steps. That's when our team goes rogue and give the aliens one more chance. The alien releases a bunch of these ink circles and Louise has to figure out what it means. All throughout the movie she's been having dreams/visions of her daughter and those will be key to figuring out what's going on.Arrival starts and ends with some preposterous pompous music. Fortunately, throughout the movie we are spared that stuff. The movie looks rather ugly, a very misguided choice by the director. The spaceship is utterly unremarkable inside and out and everything is rather colorless. The aliens too aren't particularly interesting although more about their presence is revealed later on. Unfortunately, the movie centers on this lame and dull woman. Ian's contributions aren't clear. His job is to be the woman's sidekick, the best a male character can hope for in Hollywood these days. Even Forest Whitaker who is a compelling actor isn't allowed to do much.Initially, Arrival is very exciting, up to the point where they meet the aliens. Our main characters aren't in charge, no one is, because what is going on is so much larger than any one person or group of persons. But eventually the excitement subsides as the woman's visions that don't make much sense to us yet, or aren't all that relevant after all, take precedence. Those visions for some reason are filmed in richer color and given a better look.But it's the story here that shines. The symbol for ""weapon"" will turn out to have another meaning as well. And the movie makes clear how easy it is to start wars, for something as simple as an equivocation on a word. Time is also a main issue here as the aliens, unlike humans, aren't stuck in the arrow of time but have greater freedom in time. This freedom is granted to them by their language.In the end we learn why the aliens arrive, what they say and mean, what Louise's visions are all about, and how what initially looked like catastrophe--the imminent military response by the world powers--was averted. It's meaningful and insightful stuff. However, I'm not thrilled by how it was presented in some overly-dramatic fashion. In some way the audience is also cheated because in the end the story wasn't told entirely linearly, but that was probably necessitated by the story itself. Still, I think it could have been directed/edited in a different, more interesting way. The story is smarter than most these days, but the tone of the movie is a bit arrogant. The movie thinks it's even smarter than it really is.Arrival is strong movie with a rich intriguing story. It's enlightening but not entirely satisfying. I can't get rid of the feeling that a much better movie could have been made with this material."
" Delightfully deep and powerful
",0.7579,0.9728,2017-02-06 00:00:00,9,"Arrival is another great film by Villeneuve, who seems unable to put a foot wrong so far. It has a suspenseful score akin to Sicario that creates a tense and highly strung tone. Amy Adams showcases some incredible acting that helps bring to light its interesting and questioning time-line. Playing with concepts of the effect of language on the mind, this film is emotionally charged, as well as influential on its take on language, time, and the inevitability of ones actions. Arrival is a fantastic film, enabling a shroud of intrigue and excitement with the perfect close. It is disappointing to see such a talented actress as Adams still not rewarded for her performances, that are unquestionably getting better as the years progress."

It was supposed to be a science fiction movie but it was mostly emotional crap; filled with worn out ideas mixed into a potpourri from other recent, alien visitation, movies. Acting was too dull from the main character, too frigid, too slow; Louise Banks character should have been played by someone more dynamic; or maybe the two main roles should have been switched. Just a little change in the storyline could have turned this movie into something worth moviegoers time; if inspiration from other moves was to be taken then maybe Contact (1997) should have been used."

I know I would be left clueless at the end of the movie and I indeed was...I didn't get the relationship with the daughter and how it helped the movie. I thought the flashback scenes would give some clue to what was going on with the aliens because the other scenes didn't. The acting is foolproof but the story made absolutely no sense.We get that the aliens weren't violent in nature but how exactly did they help humanity? And how will humanity help them in 3000 years. Certainly, the almost two-hour long movie didn't answer that question.I didn't expect much from this movie but I watched it nonetheless to prove that it was no good."

It was with great anticipation then that I watched Arrival hoping it would live up to its hype. Boy was I disappointed.My reaction after the movie finished was... wtf was that! What it is, in fact, is a series of translation sessions, twixt alien and human, all drawn out to excruciatingly boring lengths.There is very little suspense, practically zero action, and even less in the way of an interesting story line. Essentially, the movie consists of a face to face between 2 giant squids (the aliens) and two humans, one a language expert and the other, I don't even remember why he was there... perhaps as the obligatory romantic interest.In the end, we discover that time is circular, or was it back to front? I'm not really sure, but it was a very long and boring exercise just to reach that rather strange anti-climax.Everybody sees different things in movies and opinions are always subjective. For me, Arrival was just one huge let down."
" Reflection inducing, but screenplay and science are weak.
",-0.5927,0.9932,2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Checking first 4 or 5 pages with reviews I've only found ones with a rating of 9 or 10 and 5 or below. That's ambivalent..I've rated the movie with a 7, because of it's reflection inducing values, very nice special effects, not bad music and acting. But the screenplay and directing are this movies weak sides. The scriptwriter is supposed to make sure everything makes sense, is reliable, logical and error free. A director is responsible for controlling all of that and suggesting some changes for the better, but they both failed completely.The first problem is the incoherence between the suggested high level of intelligence and development of the alien race and what we see in the script. The aliens arrive, but they're like children - unprepared, not knowing what to do, not knowing how to communicate, with no initiative. Humans which are supposed to be a less developed race have to teach them communication, just like dealing with some autistic children. Of course it even takes time before they start to understand the difference between ""human"" and an individual name.From the other side we have humans which choose just two people - one quite random scientist, who's in the middle of his 40s instead of some experienced expert and one linguist. No one else is needed. Well, they theoretically have some ""teams"", but obviously these teams don't do anything at all. And this best linguist also doesn't know how to start a conversation. She even teaches in school, but she can't figure out that it might be a good idea to for example link images with words to teach these aliens instead of writing them words and trying to explain what you mean by chaotic other words and gestures. It's good these aliens are at least available to see, which really isn't that obvious.The aliens can open the hatch only once per 18 hours even though they possess an advanced technology and it seems the area where they stand is sealed, so there's no real reason for this interval.The aliens have chosen to land on 12 different locations even though their aim was to simply transfer their language thus allowing humans (or some of them) to perceive time differently which is supposed to help them and earn their help in the future, but hey.. why did they needed to land on these 12 locations instead of one? There's no answer for this. The same as why can't they help themselves if they have 3 thousand years for that? Are humans more capable of developing some helping skills during this time than they are? Doesn't seem to have sense.Then we have the political motive. We can see China and Russia as these primitives who can't be patient enough to conduct any peace talks, but want to use force since practically the beginning. And I could even agree with that a bit, because in general the more liberal and democratic a society is, the more likely it is to use peaceful and rational approach and the more autocratic and conservative a society is the more likely it is to use violence and coercion to solve it's problems. But still it's quite ""propagandish"".And they don't even have the The whole parenthood motive is very weak and seems to be added just for inducing people's emotions and thus making the movie's rating better. And does this scientist guy really seem like a person who abandons his family ""only"" because he knows that his daughter will die in the future?But the worst of all is this destiny motive. The movie clearly indicated that you cannot change your future, regardless of whether you know it or not. Destiny can be somewhat understood as long as you don't assume you know your future, because hey.. from the future perspective everything you've done in your past could only go one way. Life is not a PC game, where you can make a save, then try out a couple of future outcomes and go on with the most preferred. But it gets complicated once you assume you know the future. The theory that you would still be incapable of changing it is one of the most laughable science assumptions. The aliens can't prevent their future problems, the min character can't choose to have a healthy child by prenatal diagnosis.. hell, these highly developed aliens don't even have a prescription for cell regeneration (and thus preventing aging and most of the diseases) even though scientists all agree that it should easily be achievable to crack it before one millennium, maybe in few centuries. If it's written in their bubble-language that ten years from now you will choose to go right at the crossroads, you'll have to go right even if you'll know it and you'd prefer to go left. It reduces life to a massive puppet show.Okay, there was more I noticed during the watching session, but now it's all I remember. It's definitely very far away from a ""sci-fi masterpiece"" some call it (I really pity for their lack of analytical thinking and scientific knowledge), but from the other side it's not as bad as some no-life haters say and it should be able to induce some more thoughts than usual in most of the viewers, which is good."
" A psychological drama in disguise
",-0.25,0.9728,2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"Remember Lucy? That film made by a French director about a girl who took a brain-enhancing drug which gave her abilities beyond logical comprehension. Well, if you do then Arrival, made by another French director, might be something you're prepared for.Is it completely true? Both yes and no. Yes, because this film tries to take a different path unfolding a rather exploited premise, breaking both the clichés and the barriers of plausibility. No, because this time action is not the means by which the film talks to its audience. Not the main means at least.It's hard to discuss the film's details without crossing onto the land of spoilers, and you definitely don't want this film to be spoiled for you. But one thing is for sure: if you don't mind some suspension of disbelief and if you perceive cinema not just as a carrier of logically-grounded and scientifically-proved statements but rather as a conduit for emotions, then Arrival is a kind of a movie you might not wanna miss.At the center of this intertwined whirlwind of human feelings and grand scientific revelations is a figure of Louise Baker (played by Amy Adams), a top-level linguist summoned to establish contact with a group of aliens. Mrs Adams, along with her co-star Jeremy Renner who played Ian Donnelly, a physicist and Louise's colleague, are no strangers to the films featuring extraterrestrial creatures. Yet it's not the sci-fi that has the most value in Arrival. It's the whole gamut of our very human emotions, from fear, anger and desperation to hope, happiness and love. And while there are some nice visuals to please our eyes in this film, and some intellectual claims and assumptions to make our brains engaged, it's the feelings, and how painfully exposed emotion-wise Amy Adams goes to convey them, are what you keep thinking about and sensing once the film is over. And that, in our utterly material world, is an achievement of its own accord.I still can't get over the obvious parallels with Lucy, something that you'll probably be thinking about as well once you've seen the films. Yet Lucy, albeit so action-packed and fast-paced, felt incredibly hollow inside, so hollow that the absurdity of its premise becomes first apparent and then abhorrent. Here, however, the absurdity is just a single step you only have to take once, in a leap of faith, to reach the connection with what's happening on screen. Just like Louise, who reaches out to the alien creatures to be able to communicate with them in their strange language, this film talks to us and induces thoughts and emotions both familiar and so irrelevant to what's seemingly being discussed. What do we make of our lives? Do we regret our mistakes? Would we change something if we knew what it's gonna end with? Would we wanna keep living at all? There are no correct answers to those questions, neither in this film nor anywhere else, but sometimes even simply asking could make a change. After all, some things are just a reflection of how we see and treat them."
" An inspired, visionary, and emotional appeal to knowledge and humanity
",0.802,0.9319,2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie has done something that rarely happens to me. It has left me emotional on many levels, it has inspired vision, and is very thought provoking. As someone who speaks more than one language fluently, I do understand the difficulty, both, in mastering different meanings, and how one misspoken word can potentially cause conflict.I've always had a love for science-fiction, especially Star Trek, so the entire concept of mutual understanding, working together, and even the concept that time is not linear, was nothing new to me. In a time and age where it seems that 'racism' is common place again, and in a time, that seems to seed diversity more than unity, this movie touches on something that is very, very true. The fact that only if we all realize that there is only ONE RACE on this world, when we start working together, only then will we truly start making progress. That is where this movie conveys its powerful message.Whether the alien species shown in this movie recognizes our potential, our creativity, and above all else the one trait that all of us have in common, curiosity, or whether they just found the one other planet close by that has intelligent life, is kept in the dark. It is not important. What we have here is a linguist and a scientist who both try to establish a dialogue, constantly fighting the fear and instinct to lash out by their own, and other country's governments and military. We understand the importance to not surrender to fear, distrust, and paranoia, which is something that plays an all too real role in our time and age.The conclusion that a single gesture to reach out can change the course of history, and that even cultures that are diverse to the superficial view, have a common ground; basic interaction, personal needs, wishes, and desires, and that those are far more important than any political agenda. The moment we realize that talking to one another, and more importantly listening, is the solution to conflict, a global peace will be possible.This is a movie about science, knowledge, and understanding. If you don't find that appealing, the entire message may be lost on you anyway, but you would also miss one of the greatest science-fiction movies of all time."
" Best of 2017
",0.6369,0.967,2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"Firstly, to put your mind at ease, I won't be analyzing the plot, thus avoiding the use of spoilers. This decade, Villeneuve has crafted some fantastic works of art in the form of 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and now this science fiction gem, and here's hoping his career further develops with more movie masterpieces coming our way. In a world where mysteries remain and the possibility of extraterrestrial life still stands unanswered, 'Arrival' approaches this with it's cliché-free take on the genre.One scene in particular features a cloud that took my breath away. Sure, the extraterrestrial vehicle was amazing, but that cloud... As a photojournalist of nearly fifty years, I was stunned at the lifelike character of the cloud and suspected it was real, though I knew that was impossible; you can't cue Mother Nature when it's time to roll. I wanted to praise the CGI team for the effect, but Shawn Levy confirmed it was natural. They had set up to shoot this wide shot, worried about impending rain, or too much wind, or the lighting being too dark for the right effect, but the cloud wanted to become a star that day, and it rolled into frame with absolute perfection. This scene alone is worth a nod to Bradford Young for best cinematography."

I am wondering how manipulated this score is in real...In global this movie is bad, very bad : Worst script ever, not even high FX special effects but for the most : a dozen things in this movie are totally laughable. SPOILER ALERT : 1. why would a highly evolved species come to earth, travel to in time, to 'tell' us : we need you ?!...Abott is dying :-). Uh, couldn't they have help themselves ?! Come on. 2. those species would have figured out to speak with us before they came, don't they ?! 3. Why would they need our help if they already knew we would have helped them in the future? Or am i missing the point ? So why come back as everything was fine? 4. Follow me : Amy has lost her child right (wheter it's a dream or not, that's not important). The child she had with Jeremy right? So she knew him, right? OK, the army comes and get her to help and she sees her husband in the helicopter...and...does not recognizes him...WHY? It's a joke, that's why. 5. When the squids would need are help, in heavens sake why would they hang their vessel so high that the marines have to use a lift ! 6. Why would the Squids make it that hard to get in the vessel when they need help ? Make it easy and put the damn thing on the ground no ?! Oh yes i see...when the screenwriters would have placed it on the ground the one and only cgi-fx special effect was gone... 7. They had problems to get in the vessel...an hour later we see are dearest Amy get in by a shuttle...those squids are really enjoying this :-) 8. Why does the door have to open every 18 hours ? why why why. It'a a joke ! 9. In the end you can see the vessel can go horizontal... if they would have done that in the first place, Amy and co would have no problem to step in. 10. The Squids leave...yes they leave without anything...just like that... 11. I could go on for an hour writing down the stupidity of this movie. It's a shame and i can not believe this score. In my opinion this score is....you know what i mean. Thnx for reading."

Yeegads, the movie is a confusing mess and the message just doesn't get across. The movie is full of tired clichés: the misunderstood aliens who want to help mankind, the aggressive stupid military (anxious to fight a species with interstellar travel capability),the lower ranking GI who is allowed access to the most important scientific and diplomatic site in world history, etc. I love sci-fi but Arrival is a huge disappointment.

Aesthetically it's stunning, the acting is first class and I found the aliens and their technology intriguing. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are both excellent, with solid support from Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg. On the downside the story is a touch pretentious, yearning to be taken seriously. Through terminal illnesses and mathematical and linguistic conundrums it paints itself as something profound and new but in truth is lacking any originality or depth. Disappointingly there's also the usual clichéd sci-fi tropes thrown in, such as Russia and China being portrayed as insensitive and overly aggressive, the disillusioned rogue soldier who attempts to sabotage our heroes' world saving plans, shots of rioting breaking out on news channels around the globe. Yawn.It's a decent film, and worth a viewing if you have any interest in sci-fi, but one I doubt warrants repeated viewing."
" Special Science Fiction

Only at the end did I realize those ""memories"" are had been from the future. Background music is another advantage of this movie while the color is a little dim for me.

There is art in every aspect. Cinematography - the pictures are amazing, on big as well as small screens. The mood is transported in so many shots. Cast - Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams are simply great and play believable parts. Especially the sensitivity in Adam's character is very convincing.The plot itself is well paced. There is no crazy action sequence, not crazy shooting or any wild and typical sci-fi element which is can be off putting to non-genre fans. I enjoyed the movie greatly because and foremost of its witty and smart writing.

" Really???

Upset I spent money to purchase instead of waiting for it to come on cable, Netflix or regular TV. In reflection this was like a soulless failed M.Knight S. like imitation film lacking charm or style. The movie falls flat and is actually a failure with an 8.2 rating? Captain Marks whom u will see little of is the only person of interest and that is because when u see his face u instantly know he is going to do something...eventually. Again the film fails, had they only shown more of Captain Marks and managed to have scripted and built a little suspense in his role around his actions. They could have cut many of the scenes with Amy Adams and made that happen. Towards the end of the film it is over the top obvious that u have not seen the husband so u know who the husband will be as the film has bored u so long, has to be near its end and it is too late to introduce a new character. A slow slightly boring movie doesn't bother me if overall it has a great story. I have not acted since 7th grade when I faltered over memorizing my lines after a star turn in the 6th grade when a 3 person classroom play was accidentally aired locally by a group testing new equipment but if I had been inserted in the movie and acted badly stumbling over my lines, it would have added some drama and interest. All the immensely competent actors in this film looked and sounded they were all on a lot of Prozac! The dullness of the movie is related to both directional and screenplay issues. Amy Adams tries to create a mood and aura with her acting but she is just a person too much in their own head and not fully interacting with anyone around her. Too bad they put everyone else in the same head space. I believe the reviewers that actually watched the movie not just the trailers had to rate it highly on what could and should have been, not what the movie actually was!"

Also, The dialogues are quite lame, and rather forced, especially the captain's. it is as if the director / script forced conflicts when they were not natural. The good: Never the less what I thought during the movie as a wrong casting choice proved a very right choice at the end. the movie tricked me very well and props for that. The Idea and story are great and once the movie is over you think and try to understand all you have seen. and then everything fits.

" Lets communicate E.T.
",0.0,0.9963,2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"""Remember what happened to the aborigines. A more advanced race nearly wiped them out.""Science fiction is a genre that leaves room for ideological visions and fictional future scenarios. A technological fantasy story, as it were. In ""Arrival"" this is more applicable on a human level. In this case it's the effort of humanity to communicate with an alien civilization. That's fiction enough already. We're not even capable of communicating with each other as humans in a decent manner. Let alone with an alien race that speaks with the use of primal sounds. It's like having a conversation with a group of surreal musicians who produce ingenious sound effects with polyphonic synthesizers. ""Arrival"" isn't overloaded with graphical masterpieces what an average person would expect to see in a SF. No huge spaceships propelling through galaxies. There are no enormous space wars taking place with massive laser battles. No, just 12 black spacecraft, looking like huge black cashew nuts, floating seemingly motionless a few meters above the earth's surface, spread all over our globe. The central theme is the almost impossible task to establish a communication between humans and aliens. This mission is being led by the linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) together with the mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). For them it's a real challenge to fathom the semantics used by these aliens and to interpret the sprayed circles (with extraterrestrial ink), produced by the tentacles of the octopus-like aliens. And next to that, her work is also hampered by recurring memories of her deceased daughter.You could conclude very quickly that this would constitute a slow and über-serious science fiction. A film to which literary scholars would respond rather enthusiastically. But believe me, ""Arrival"" is so ingeniously constructed and compelling that your attention won't slack for a moment. Even if a Masai warrior would perform a ""jumping dance"" next to your couch. First there's the melodramatic beginning with a brief, modest overview of Louise's life and where fate hits merciless hard. Then we move on to the section where the visitors are introduced and Louise's help is asked so she would give these, as immigrants considered newcomers, an integration course. The fact that only the US apparently are open to a dialogue while other countries, such as China and Russia, would rather shoot these coffee beans to smithereens, is in my opinion a romanticizing of our current global situation.The emphasis is on the educational aspect with Louise and Donnelly working against the clock and trying to start a dialogue. Meanwhile we see flashbacks about Louise's daughter. A major event that runs like a thread through the film. However, when the disclosure becomes clear, the message behind the whole turns out to be much larger than the seemingly simplistic story-line. When the true reason for the alien is revealed and the implications get clearer, the film takes on a whole different meaning. ""Arrival"" is a SF with a philosophical slant that'll give you food for thought. Ultimately communicating is the central message in itself. And this on all areas. Hats off to those aliens. They made this miserable long trip just to point this out to us humans. Way to go.""Arrival"" isn't an action packed Sci-fi full of impressive CGI. But on the other hand, the shown images are incredibly beautiful. The concise fictional elements look minimalistic and at the same time amazing. Such as the entering of the spacecraft with it's tilting, confusing gravity. The mood of this film is immersive. And this also thanks to the supporting soundtrack. Add to that the rather superb performances and a thoughtful script, and you'll get a great movie. ""Arrival"" is not an exceptional SF, but still manages to impress thanks to a masterful concept. Villeneuve-worthy in other words.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

All in all, disappointing. That's all I have to say but since I'm being forced to write 10 lines of text let me remark that the lake front home of Amy Adams's character (honestly I can't remember her character's name or be bothered to look it up) was pretty nice.

We have been led to believe that whatever exists beyond the atmosphere, kills. that is exactly why the movie-fed world needs a shock such as this.I loved how easily the movie fooled me by making me believe that any flashback has to be 'back'.

Joe type scenario, watch it again from a different perspective. Arrival had 2 important messages for me and I hope others see the same after viewing it.1. Mankind is too quick to declare war on anything they feel threatens them WITHOUT making the effort to fully understand the situation. Look at our current leaders of the first world nations - the USA, China, Russia, the UK...all of them are full of s*#t, threatening and bullying those they deem lesser than themselves. There has never been a more USELESS organization than the United Nations (Palestine, Syria, Rwanda..the list goes on where these countries are at the mercy of the these so-called world leaders who couldn't give a flying f&#k!) which basically looks and acts like a front that has no substance and takes their orders from the very sources committing these atrocities. 2. While we don't officially have the tech to fly through time in either direction (by the time you read this review, opinion may have revised), the second theme is just as important as the first: learn from the past to prevent errors from happening in the present in order to protect our collective future!We don't have an infinite amount of time so we need to act, however this doesn't mean be an a$$hole and pillage/steal/threaten/destroy in order to come out top dog / ahead of the competition. If everyone works towards bettering themselves, alone, instead of uniting to better humanity, 99% of the world and her beauty is lost to us.

I was just bored.And when it was over I was annoyed that I had persevered with it though I really knew at about half way that it wasn't going to amount to much. I will never understand why people rate films highly based solely on a twist at the end, when there is little or no tension, little or no atmosphere building throughout.I think people value a twist too highly.This movie also exhibits one of my other great hates. It lacks accountability in that it's just make it up as you go along. Things don't tie together properly and even where they do, so what!!! Lots of stuff is unexplained like how they manage to decipher the language. The aliens are stereotypical squid like blobs which also drives me nuts.The music is lauded as atmospheric but it's nothing original. Think of War Of The Worlds. My over riding thought when it was over was, it had nothing to do with aliens and all to do with communication. What was the point of the aliens??? They may as well have left them out.

",0.0,0.1655,2017-02-03 00:00:00,5,"I like a good sci-fi flick, but sadly this movie just wasn't such a thing, it left me wondering where the story was and why it was jumping all over the place, from past to present to future back to present and then the future etc etc etc.After a brief glimpse into the main characters personal life, we are then suddenly hauled off to a military with her where we are informed that 12 giant levitating teaspoons, operated by squid like aliens, have arrived from space (no mensioning where from), then from here its just a huge mess of confusion, from inside the base to inside this giant teaspoon, back and forth, trying to decode the aliens language, which is just a bunch of flowery looking circles, diving between the characters present time, with some past, and future, then back to the present etc etc, its just a messed up story line, filled with everyone falling over themselves trying to figure out what each of these funny looking circles is saying, and after all this craziness, including somehow managing to stop various nations from blowing these creatures to smithereens all from one simple phone call, the aliens have just one simple message for humankind, apparently they suggest that we all be nice to each other and all get along (thanks alien dudes, that's a great (BLEEP) message for us, there goes weapons and arms sales).I saw the movie had some great actors and actresses in it, bad sadly I felt it was a waste of talent for them, as the movie looked like it was just slapped together during a coffee break."
" Entertaining but not great
",-0.5409,0.9581,2017-02-03 00:00:00,5,"Very good, its entertaining. Its not the Tour de Force I expected from reviews, but excellent in presenting a different idea or alternative way of living. I give it a 7 of 10 instead of higher, because its too disconnected in its resolution as far as the protagonist is concerned. And its too big of a reach. What she remembers is the issue here. The malleability of time, is what downgrades this a few notches. It leaves way too much to be desired. Adans, Renner, and Whittaker put forward some very good acting. The effects themselves though, are more believable than the premise. Sci fi has been somewhat dumbed down over recent decades. But this one meets the criteria of making you think. Which is what has always been a sign of a good movie to me, sci fi or not."
" Thoughtful and Beautiful
",0.7579,0.9934,2017-02-03 00:00:00,9,"Science fiction films tend to stratify into 3 categories, in my mind. The most commercially successful are really just adventure films set in a science fiction universe. These focus on action and fantasy, with futuristic or high-concept elements. They leverage classic story archetypes and superlative visuals to produce enjoyable escapism. Star Wars is the exemplar of this sub-genre, and although Star Trek aspires to greater scientific rigor, it belongs here too.The second set similarly uses science as a backdrop for noir. These are the darker films, the dystopian adventures. They may not be as hopeful or as fun, but they tend to be more pointed. These films typically propound on a ""what if"" premise, plumbing the dingy depths of possibility. The best are often imaginative, twisted interrogations of human nature or society. This is Blade Runner, The Matrix, Dark City.Finally, there are what I like to call ""thinking"" films. They are headier, and explore ideas that fundamentally change reality or alter our perception of it. They eschew spectacle and adrenaline to allow the audience to dive deep on a single premise. These films are typically smaller in focus, slower, often centering around the journey of a single character. Usually less accessible movies, Hamlet might opine that these ""pleased not the million, (but) 'twas caviar to the general"". I would count 2001, Interstellar, K-PAX and others as ""thinking"" sci-fi. Arrival fits securely in this group.Arrival is a big budget take on a small story, focusing almost myopically on Louise, a linguistics expert who is conscripted to help communicate with extra-terrestrial beings who arrive suddenly above the Earth. Her journey of consciousness as she learns to comprehend the aliens serves as the plot, using the events of the story more as context than narrative. Director Denis Villeneuve deftly uses arresting visuals and frank, realistic sensibilities to relate a story that might otherwise be esoteric. It's fantastic elements are believable because of his steady hand, and even the few quibbles i had in hindsight melted away while watching the screen.Arrival is an experience. It is thoughtful and beautiful, and has lingered in my thoughts since viewing."
" A great movie tainted by a single, poor plot choice
",0.25,-0.9096,2017-02-03 00:00:00,4,"As stated in this title, this movie was entertaining for the most part, but the sum was tainted by one major, glaring flaw. The dramatic tension relied upon humanity's warmongering nature and stupidity overwhelming their senses enough to a completely self- destructive degree. Humanity considering attacking a superior force out of fear is plausible, but not after several months of peaceful coexistence - that is plenty of time for those lingering fears to vanish. Even the sensationalist media couldn't drive an ""alien invader"" narrative that long without any real evidence to suggest that to be the case. With that in mind, their attempts at dramatic tension not only fell flat, but it detracted from what is otherwise a great film. I really enjoyed everything else in the movie and would have given it a 9/10 happily, but that one suspension-of-disbelief destroying trait (which was probably only injected into the movie for the sake of poorly trying to keep the lowest common denominator interested) detracted from the movie enough to drop it down to a generous 4/10."
" A stellar story of alien visitation, language barriers, scientists and human grief
",-0.4939,0.9706,2017-02-03 00:00:00,10,"Based on Ted Chiand's brilliant science fiction short story 'The Story of Your Life' and directed by Denis Villeneuve, it is no wonder this movie turned out to be good. Villeneuve is a master of puzzles and ambiguity, as his previous movie 'Enemy' demonstrated, and he is no stranger to intense atmosphere either, as seen in 'Sicario'. 'Arrival' has a bit of both, and it also brings warm humanity into the mix. Paradoxical as it is in a movie about alien visitation, 'Arrival' is a story about human emotions at its heart. It is a story of love and grief and letting go and I'm not ashamed to say that it brought me to tears.The movie is largely carried by three things: Amy Adams' moving acting performance, the central mystery of the story that slowly unravels, and the otherworldly atmosphere that comes from the unnatural design of the monolithic spaceships and the disturbing yet beautiful musical score. Quite like 'Contact' - another one of my favorite science fiction movies - the movie is not an action adventure but focuses on actual science, hypothetical as it may be, and like in 'Contact', the science makes way for the emotional content and the protagonist's character arc.The short story 'The Story of Your Life' is mainly focused on the alien language and the science of linguistics. The movie follows suit, though it adds some things to spice it up a bit. But the linguistics are central to the story, and they are fascinating. The aliens have a writing system that does not correspond to the sounds they make but is an entirely self-contained language. They use a single symbol to represent several words and even several phrases, piling layers of meaning onto the symbol until it is nearly impossible for humans to distinguish all that the symbol contains. This is so delightfully alien and yet so frighteningly plausible that the thought makes me squirm.By the way: the film's title refers to more than just the arrival of the aliens."
" Missed Opportunity
",0.1531,0.9372,2017-02-03 00:00:00,7,"I was excited to see the film, hoping that finally a movie would explore just how rich the possibilities of communication are. But nope, we again and again get a very anthropomorphized bred of aliens.It bothers me that they have too much in common with humans. Their primary medium of perception is visual perception apparently; they not only use visually perceivable system of communication, but also react to external stimuli by visual observation (doing nothing but looking at the humans as they arrive on the ship).Their language is of course easily translatable to human languages within a few months. Just try to translate the communication system of bats or dolphins; you cannot. Alien communication should be even harder as we do not even share basic genetic familiarities with them. The only reason we cannot understand dolphins, but we can somehow teach gorillas sign-language, is that both humans and gorillas have a lot in common in how they conceive reality. Our concept formation processes are similar, hence the availability of a translation between our systems of communication. This should not work for aliens.Other than the issue of communication, the movie itself is just another example of a typical Hollywood flick. The Americans are the good guys, and the Chinese, the Russians and some other Muslim countries are bad guys. The main characters end up romantically involved just like in any other movie.There is one good thing that Villeneuve does exceptionally well, and it's that he can show the paranoia, the pessimism, the capacity of destruction that lie within humanity. Incendies and Sicario were good movies in this aspect; they weren't filled with naive optimism, but a realist pessimism. Arrival does it well too. It's right in saying that the biggest obstacle of humanity is humanity itself.Lastly, there's the aspect of being able to perceive time non-linearly. Yes, language is more than just naming objects. It's the bedrock of culture, and science for that matter as well. But it's not a magical potion that gives you superpowers. I hated that aspect of Interstellar, but as most scientists found the movie okay, I just said maybe I am scientifically illiterate. But I know that in this movie, science-fiction becomes a fantasy."

The film basically ends where its starts.The alien ""squids"" have the ability and intelligence to travel halfway around the universe/Galaxy (we never know) and can predict the future, transcend space and time, but some how, they are unable to communicate with us primitive humans, except through some bizarre form of symbols which they spray into a glass panel, and the US linguist, Louise, is somehow able to translate this within an amazingly short period of time (how, we never know)Ian, the theoretical physicist, is a total waste of space and contributes nothing to the film apart from being Louise's future breeding partner for producing a child. Yes, its that pathetic and emotionless.The ""film"" attempts to convey meaning and emotion with Louise having constant flashes of a daughter she is yet to have. But this is nothing more then pretentious rubbish and is just plain boring!!The characters in the film are uninteresting. Never did i feel a connection or interest. They are just dull as cardboard.In the end the aliens leave.... that's it, and the credits roll. No answers, no resolutions, NOTHING!I have no idea how this ""film"" has such a high approval rate or what the appeal is.On a scientific level, it offers nothing. Story line, it goes nowhere.

I liked the story. And you need to stick to the entire movie to completely understand when this film is all about. This film reminded me of ""Interstellar"". The signs actually symbols time loop. When ever Amy asks anything to the aliens they reply with a circle sign. At the end of the movie it means a snake eating itself symbol.... a time loop. All the time the aliens were trying to say what the gift they want to give the human race. Which is power to see future.At start of the movie we see the future first where Amy's kid had cancer. After the aliens gave Amy the power to see future she saw what the message she told China president/official in phone. She sees glimpse of her future. She also sees that she wrote a book where she explained all the meaning of those signs. This way she knows what the signs actually meant in present.This a huge time loop puzzle film. I think I will have to watch it again from start to solve all the puzzle.Honestly I love to watch science fiction movies which challenge me to understand the plot. Films like Inception, Inderstellar, Predestination and this are such kind of film which is not for everybody to understand.Please Do not stop making such movies.Thanks."

Despite the many books and films touching that thematic, it's so overwhelming that the movie goers have an endless interest in it. However, Arrival succeeded to kill even that interest. The movie is simply boring. For minutes you should watch just a dark screen on which nothing goes on. And the dialogues are as interesting as a lesson on the dialects of the wooden frogs. But how this move got its high rating? Most of those ratings are coming from the young viewers. They have never seen the great movies of the 50s, and 60s, and 70s, so they have nothing to compare to. Any drivel that has a killer or a thousand of car crashes gets their high approval rating. Too bad that the movie industry is dying against our eyes."

Jut try to read all the questions that other people raised in their reviews.I really liked that person review and his/her question are valid.So many things in the movie make ZERO sense, just a few examples:The colonel expects the linguist to decipher some alien language that sounds like gwowodkgjdkgrowlhwkas on the spot from a dicta phone.Most important event in humankind and all decisions are taken by some random soldiers in the camp. President of the US or any politicians are never shown and take no role whatsoever in the story.Some ""rogue"" soldier (god knows how) gets his hands on explosives, avoids all controls, and expects to destroy with a few C4 charges a huge spaceship which defies the laws of physics.The way they ""decipher"" the alien random scrabbling are just completely arbitrary and laughable (aka there is no explanation on how anything is deciphered) but magically after a few months they have a full vocabulary with which they can have a conversation. In real history many real human languages based on actual letters (not random stains in the air) were a completely unintelligible until the Rosetta Stone was found with a key to understand them.The alien presence on earth is just nonsensical. They arrive, say that they have bought some ""gift"" to humanity because in 3000 years they will need help in return (for what?) and then they disappear in thin air without having accomplished anything.The attack by the Chinese general (again, no government exists, it seems that soldier can just do what the heck the want) is stopped by some phone call whose contents nobody bothers to explain.most of the movie is just going back and forth from the ship, zzzzzzzzzzThe physicist is practically useless.

" Review -Arrival (2016)
",0.0,-0.8074,2017-02-02 00:00:00,5,"You will be disappointed if you think its just another alien movie. If you need an action alien film, watch ""Independence Day"".The movie starts with a mother, Louise, and her loss of losing a young daughter. It was sad. Then it jumps to the arrival of stone like structures appearing around the globe, hovering 20 feet above the ground. Louise is a doctor in linguistics and is called to serve her country by communicating and understanding aliens. Louise is teamed up with Ian the scientist to explore the reasons for the arrival of alien ships.The movie goes on with the world threatened by aliens and different nation's different approach to the threat handling. During all the chaos, word spreads that the aliens are here to deliver / sell a weapon, which spikes greed in all the countries for it and creates more instability.Louise however, studies the language and comes to the conclusion that the aliens are here to give them a gift. The gift of their language which will help them foresee the future as they advance. Louise's understanding of language opens the future to her. She sees, how she could prevent the war on aliens and help mankind. And she handles it well.Now comes the twist. Remember when I wrote that the movie starts with Louise and her loss of daughter, well that part was actually future. Louise never had a daughter before arrival of the aliens. But learning their language cleared the future and she knew what would happen and how her daughter will get sick of an incurable disease in the future.The interesting part is that she still chooses to marry Ian and have a daughter because she loved her so much in her visions.The aliens left earth by disappearing after the gift. The question is, why were they here to give us the gift of future vision? Maybe because they had already seen the destruction of earth because of all the war and hate. And now they wanted us to see it and stop it from happening.In my opinion, the movie was good but it could be complicated for some people. But do watch it and comment."

Perhaps a bit light on the plot as well, but interestingly made and engaging.My only criticism is way the aliens are conceived. Could definitely be more imaginative. I can understand taking cues from around us to create a creature, such as in Alien, but this was a bit too obvious, in my opinion.If you are looking for laser blasters and light sabres, stay away.

The Martian (2015) wouldn't have made it hasn't it been by the Chinese (divine) intervention. Now Arrival (2016) at the end they just get rid of the aliens and start praising China. China was the main issue all along the movie. How China was moving it's forces to stop the aliens. How China was reacting. And at the end, it was a call to China what stopped the war. Maybe the fact that China is buying half of Hollywood is just a coincidence. If the Sci-Fi movies are going to drift toward China propaganda I do not see a very bright future for the genre. Unless they rely on Chinese people to watch them. But with China restrictions on what can you watch and what can you not, I sincerely wouldn't go down that road. The music gets annoying at the end. Too many violins. And too many flashbacks to actually nothing. Probably the book the movie is based upon, ""Story of Your Life"" would make it more understandable. The movie is full of clues. But they point to nothing. It is just an exercise on flashback technique. Watching your lawn grow it is quite more exciting. And less expensive."

" Great potential, but still falls short
",0.3716,0.8322,2017-02-02 00:00:00,5,"When I first saw the trailer for Arrival, I was very excited - it's not that often we get to see some serious SF movies, not packed with action. I was excited to see how a brilliant director such as Villeneuve would approach the genre. The thing I hold against many SF movies including aliens is the lack of their background story. Who are they? Where exactly do they come from? How did they get to evolve into beings that they are now? What is their tech based on? Do they have art? What do they eat?Unfortunately, Arrival didn't answer those questions. All that we know is that the aliens will require our help in three thousand years and they've come to make sure we are ready by then. That is, in itself, very interesting and I liked it. However, it left me thirsty for more background to the story. Science fiction is not just science trying to be plausible. It is also fiction - and I love it because of that. I will most likely not meet an alien any time soon and it's movies such as this one that I hope will tell me a complete story of what might happen and who exactly the aliens are.That being said, I wish the movie contained extra 10-15 minutes of various explanations and that's what it would have made it a 10/10 movie for me. I understand not all viewers feel the same and require a backstory, but I do. Without a backstory, I feel almost cheated. As if the storytellers say ""we didn't put extra creative effort into bringing you something that would complete the story and blow your mind."""
" Ambiguous, unfulfilled, riddled with idealistic/philosophical messages, and tries too hard to be thought-provoking.
",-0.4939,0.8184,2017-02-01 00:00:00,6,"If you didn't like Villeneuve's critically acclaimed Enemy, chances are you didn't like Arrival either. For something packaged as a Sci-fi blockbuster, Arrival is really good at building up the audience's expectation for a satisfying climax using established alien-invasion tropes. However, the movie then proceeds to completely shatter this expectation with an anti-climactic and overtly philosophical ending.The recent trend toward a more realistic, darker and philosophical take of the Sci-fi genre is welcoming, but this doesn't mean philosophical abstractions and not-so-obvious political and social commentaries are good substitutes for a fulfilling story. Unfortunately, this is exactly what Arrival is. The movie's premise is good, the mysterious atmosphere in its first half is fantastic, but a climax composed mostly of rather forced philosophical messages simply left me disappointed. Similarly, I imagine some Sci-fi fans who went into the theatre expecting to be entertained and thrilled came out confused and unfulfilled."

But if you are going to build a movie like this and advertise it as an action movie then at least have action that makes sense.I kept waiting for this movie to get going. It was so predictable I thought I must be watching a different movie then everybody else was talking about which got a high rating on rotten tomatoes.

" One of the best sci-fi movies ever.
",0.6369,0.9751,2017-02-01 00:00:00,9,"Science Fiction movies are so diverse. There are successful ones like the Star Wars series that I don't even regard as Science Fiction as it's more a fantasy. The science part of Science Fiction is overlooked far too much in Star Wars. I understand that when you go to see a movie you need to suspend disbelief but many ask you to believe in new laws of physics that make zero sense or forget evolution and allow aliens to look like humans. Then there are movies like ""The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951)"" and ""Interstellar"" that I regard as brilliant.Arrival is most definitely in the latter group. Early on it is difficult to grasp where it's going but it gathers momentum quickly and the story is not only beautifully told, it's also thoroughly satisfying. It's clever Science Fiction. The aliens themselves were a great choice. Despite their appearance, animals on earth that are similar have complex nervous systems and behaviors, excellent vision, high intelligence and communicate with each other. Communication is the key to this movie as is linguist, Louise Banks played by Amy Adams. The plot revolves around her being recruited to interpret the alien's language. Amy Adams carries the movie. Much is asked of her and she delivers. I'm shocked that she didn't get a best actress Oscar nomination.""Arrival"" is beautiful, complex, and cerebral. One of the best Science Fiction movies ever."
" must see
",0.0,0.9983,2017-02-01 00:00:00,9,"Henny's Movie Review: Arrival (NO SPOILERS)In two words: MUST SEE.Arrival was truly a welcome change in a time where mindless action movies reigned supreme. It is a good drama/scifi/mystery movie that will keep your attention from beginning to end (something most movies these days are struggling with). So why are you even reading this review? Really, go and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed, especially since ""they have arrived"".The following will dissect the movie: Arrival, discuss the current movie industry and the art of film making. Don't worry I'll keep it all as concise as possible, however I do need to discuss all of the aforementioned topics since it is all related to the movie. The review will be divided into the following point:First I'll give my opinion/dissatisfaction of the movie industry (i.e., Hollywood). - Second, I'll talk about movie as a visual medium - And third I'll review the movie (certain parts of the review are intertwined with the first and second points) this time I'll keep it a bit superficial to prevent spoilers.Movies these days are often catered to the common denominator with studio executives, more often than not, deciding which path to take. This is understandable since it will most likely lead to more profit. However, depending on the choices made, these decisions can also ruin a movie. Furthermore, it is restricting the director and the rest of the cast and crew creatively. This is something that is happening too often in Hollywood (e.g., suicide squad, fan4stic), resulting in mindless action movies or movies that are afraid to take the extra step. Movies have become safe and this can be traced back to how they treat the intelligence of the audience. I often say that it is important to treat your audience as smart people whom understand more than less. This will lead to better stories and positively affect the progression of a movie (e.g., less explaining). With all that said Arrival doesn't suffer from studio interferences and most importantly treats the audience as intelligent people (more on this later in the review). I do have to admit though that I do like simple movies, they are harmless fun. Movies are a visual medium that uses images to convey a story. Even though, this is basic knowledge we still have many movies that spend hours and hours on explaining things. This shouldn't be necessary if the movie uses the visual medium properly. I'm not saying that we can cut all the dialogues out of a movie; however I'm saying that if you treat your audience as intelligent people you won't need certain dialogues. Sometimes a simple, better yet, a good impactful image can say more than a thousand words. This is something that immediately jumps to my mind when I was watching Arrival. The dialogues are short and most of the events are conveyed through visuals (e.g., facial expressions, surroundings) and atmosphere. It is one thing to tell a story but when we watch a movie we want to see it.Thank you for listening to the ramblings of an old man. Without further ado let's talk about Arrival.Arrival is a movie directed by Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners) starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. It is a well put together circa 2 hour movie that effectively uses imagery and atmosphere to convey the story and keep you intrigued.The story (no spoilers): Arrival tells a story about a linguistics professor Louise Banks, played by Amy Adams, whom is tasked to interpret an alien language when twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world. The story has a very good progression, there are no moments within the movie that dragged and throughout the narrative the movie knows where to put the focus. The atmosphere is very good and more importantly constant. It doesn't jump all over the place.Characters: The movie has two main characters namely Professor Louise Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly (played by Jeremy Renner). Louise is the main protagonist/lead character and we discover everything together with her. Her development throughout this movie is interestingly confusing. Ian is there to support Louise with scientific questions and discoveries. His role is quite minor but important to an extent. I know this is all quite vague but the reason for this is to prevent spoilers.Cinematography: The cinematography of Arrival isn't that spectacular. It has a grey/greenish color with a serious vibe throughout the movie. The alien spacecraft is interesting, but most of the time the movie takes place in an army base.Three-Act-Structure: - Beginning, Strong with a good setup for things to come. - Middle, Good continuation of what was setup with a short moment for everything to sink in. - End, Strong ending.Music: It did a good job to set to mood but other than that it isn't really noteworthy (shame).Summary/conclusion: As you can tell I really liked this movie. It was something I really needed especially since I've seen many B quality movies lately (also talking about you INFERNO). Arrival doesn't hold your hand throughout the movie and it assumes you have a basic understanding of science. I liked this because other movies would've used a part of the movie to explain every scientific theory. I would love to go into more detail about this movie especially the pros and cons, but that would spoil the movie. So I apologies for this superficial review and I promise I'll do better next time. The movie is called Arrival and it truly has. Finally a must watch movie has arrived.I give this movie a: 8.5"
" A lovely film which might only attract sci fi fans, but it has drawbacks
",0.4854,0.9825,2017-02-01 00:00:00,5,"I loved Amy Adams, and she did not overact as she often does, she played this one to perfection. However, call me dumb but I gave this a 5 which is a big break from most people reviewing the film. Why? Well firstly, once again, no matter how lovely the soundtrack, it should NEVER drown out or distract from the dialogue, yet in this movie it did several times. The dialogue and the pictures are what carry the story and if you miss what they're saying you miss part of the story. It's become de rigeur for directors to supposedly enhance their films recently with great scores, but this trend of drowning out dialogue needs to stop because it is spoiling films. Secondly, although a great story might always leave something to you to figure out, it should never leave out too much. For me Arrival left out quite a lot to the point that at first watching I have no idea of the timeline of the story. Did she have and lose her child before this alien occurrence? Did she have and lose her child after it? If she lost it afterwards she must have been seeing into the future when she was reflecting on times with her daughter during the same period she was helping to decode the aliens' language. What? I'm left with feeling there were great parts of the story, with some great cinematography, and some excellent score, but the overall experience was ruined for me by the odd parts of the story that didn't make sense, and the drowning out of dialogue by violins. This could have been a great film, but wasn't."

" The movie is unable to stick with the story
",0.0,-0.987,2017-02-01 00:00:00,1,"It is rare that movies get me furious but this one really did. I ask myself, how did anyone approve of the script for the movie? So let me explain why you should not watch this movie.Alien spaceships land on planet earth and everyone freaks out. Everyone on planet earth except for the sensible protagonists wants to blow them up because they are afraid. However, as our sensible lead characters are sensible they try to communicate with the aliens. This is trickier than expected as the aliens show no effort on their part to learn earths languages. Nevertheless, this gives the movie a plot. Study the course Alien language part 1 before the planet blows up.So what makes this all so bad? A part from everyone starting to behave erratic and wanting to fire rockets at an alien race which is probably 1000 years ahead in development than you. Well, 75% into the movie, the writers did not know how to create tension or how to write a basic story. So in order to end the movie they chose to introduce a so called 'plot device'. The female protagonist apparently learns to see into the future when she learned the grammar of the alien language. All the problems of the movie then goes away as she sees what she has to do. That plot device is what 10 year old's write in their short stories to tell a story. That and along with ""everything was a dream"". This movie waste your time and the writers should be fired for incompetence."
" Very Disappointed
",-0.5256,-0.87,2017-02-01 00:00:00,2,"My adult techie, Star Trek kids loved this movie and encouraged my wife and I to watch it. Both of us were disappointed and had trouble understanding why they liked it so much.This movie is kind of like a boring Close Encounters. I kept having problems with suspending disbelief with things like the fact that these incredibly advanced aliens had no clue about how to communicate with humans and left the translation attempts entirely on us. With their technology, they hadn't listened to any of our radio broadcasts or deep space probes? And they can't figure out how to squirt ink patterns in human language even after being tutored?? Or that the alien's ""written"" language is so readily and quickly deciphered by the experts? The plot develops slowly and ultimately doesn't make a lot of sense in terms of time travel/displacement, with the heroine's ""prior"" loss of her child from cancer emerging as the primary underlying theme. Meanwhile, the world is reacting to these non-threatening aliens like the Zombie Apocalypse? Total worldwide diplomatic breakdowns over the misinterpretation of a single word?? Can you imagine how differently Steven Spielberg would have done this? Other complaints are: The military aspects seem wrong. While Amy Adams seems OK in her role, Jeremy Renner seems totally miscast, a wise-guy in a role that should be sensitive and romantic. I hated the music which seems sappy, trite, and out-of-place and is always reminding you of itself. What's wrong with NOT having orchestra music to help you with your emotions? And the last-second ""save"" in the climax scene with Amy on the sat phone in the decontamination room just doesn't make much sense from a dramatic, let alone technical standpoint. I've seen and read enough sci-fi about time-travel/shifting to know that this is an especially tricky concept to deal with both logically, scientifically, and philosophically, but this film misses the mark on all 3."

There are many, many great Sci-Fi novels written by very good writers, but Hollywood never selects these. Instead, Hollywood selects the worst and cheapest scripts which enable them to highlight the confused and dopa mine deficient minds of the Ashkenazim. This story is only worth TV time, and that's only if you have absolutely nothing else to do. As predictable as all Hollywood Sci-Fi, a white is pre-selected by aliens upon their visit. Why Hollywood's version of Aliens always select those people dependent on Antidepressants, who knows. The aliens stay isolated so Hollywood saves money on Alien gear. No high tech sci-fi gear to marvel at in this script, not even a cool space ship or talking computer. This movie isn't even NetFlix quality."

""Arrival"" initially gave me the impression that I was about to watch an interesting and thoughtful sci-fi thriller. But as things progressed, especially after the appearance of the aliens, I realized this was not to be the case. Eventually, the film devolved into a series of confused and confusing scenes that despite their stylish look seemed to add up to very little, until the whole thing eventually collapsed into a vast pool of anticlimax. Needless to say, Amy Adams was, as usual, likable throughout despite what was going on all around her. A huge disappointment."
" Good but lazy
",-0.3182,0.9668,2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"I strongly recommend reading the book first, you will loose nothing, just the opposite. It would help you understand what is going on. Movie touches the subject of ""First contact"" and how it would change everything. It strongly points that with no common physcical or cultural background we would have a very tough time establishing any communication. It is some of the best hardcore science fiction in years but I can't get rid off the feeling that creators of this movie got lazy or out off budget at some point. ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang was a short story in itself, but they managed to butcher it down even more! For what? It is still slow and almost meditative movie, what did they achieve by making it much more primitive story? They knew they were making slow science fiction movie and yet they cut all the interesting science and conversations from the book. The character of Jeremy Renner is more like a furniture in this version etc. Also I don't understand the deviation from the original story. They did not make it any stronger or action packed, they just made no sens. Movie is slow paced and focused on attentive audience, great soundtrack and very strong emotional story of main character going through some major revelations and transformations of her personality. Pepsi generation will say it's boring and makes no sens. I would say they are dumb."

They are blurry, barely visible octopuses. How cool is that? Blurry octopuses. Freakin octopuses.Snorefest with no other interest than a good kip. 3 things I ask of a sci-fi movie with aliens, even if it is a TV B movie:1) please if you touch a topic don't leave story holes the size of Arizona;2) please let me clearly see at least 1 alien;3) please no more octopuses.This film sports a couple of blurry, uninteresting, unoriginal black octopuses spitting ink, while the story-line has holes the size of Canada. Thank you, that is material for a $40m+ budget movie, yeah? Where the hell did they spend all that money, 3/4 of the movie is talking people trying to TELL you what apparently somewhere is going on. Are chatterboxes that expensive?All the rest is simply a rip off of Epoch without even the pro of being original. Oh, yes. The film is also trying to be deep and philosophical about time and values in life. Falling horribly short, perfect stuff for illiterates. Pure senseless garbage.

Not since The Lobster (2015) have I been so fully immersed in a film from every aspect it presents itself in. From the cinematography, editing, sound effects, and production design, to the satisfyingly accurate adaptation of the short story by Ted Chiang onto the big screen, Arrival delivers a truly captivating and mesmerizing display of the art that is story-telling.The only thing that saddens me is knowing that the bar has now been set so high, that it would take a lot for me to feel this enthralled by a movie ever again."

Amy Adams role is superb along with a amazing cast (except...) still not understanding why she didn't get the Oscar nomination but ah well! Jeremy Renner doesn't really stand out in the role he plays but doesn't really impact the movie! If you are readying this and are into special effects at the start of he movie it looks like the effects are very good but nearing the end they do get a lot worse (understandable why no Oscar nomination) but once again these small flaws of the movie have no impact on the solid story line!

" Interesting Plot, But Bogged Down in Feels
",0.2144,0.0713,2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"I really got into the basic plot of the movie and the part that language plays in it. It asked a lot of great questions at the beginning and figuring out how to communicate was well done, which earned all of the 6 stars I gave it.What bogged me down was some of the melodrama that just has to be included in movies these days. I find it hard to believe that there would be such a rush with regard to aliens that have done pretty much nothing upon arrival. They didn't attack anyone. They didn't even really try to communicate in any way. They just sat there and let us come to them. I didn't understand all the stress and I certainly didn't get the whole bomb plot or responses from China and Russia.The reveal at the end was pretty interesting too, but, once again, got bogged down with the feels as so many movies do. Imo, the language plot was good enough. We didn't need the added commentary on ""life"" etc., and that was a boring distraction for me.Overall, I was disappointed what with all the hype."
" Amazing Film that may lead to future sequels
",0.5859,0.9977,2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"After watching this movie, it really made me look life differently. It captured very beautiful moments, moments of the protagonists past/future. & Although it left me very confused at times, the story slowly let me in and answered mostly all of my questions. But there is one question that is still on my mind which is when the Alien tells Dr.Louise Banks(Amy Adams) that in about 3000 years into the future, they will need humanities help. It is very unclear what it is that they will need help with, but I really hope they come up with a sequel, possibly in the future set in the year 5016. Im not sure if the director Denis Villeneuve is steering towards that direction but it will surely draw a big crowd considering the success of this film! ACTORS/CHARACTERS I just wanna point out that this is Amy Adams very best performance thus far! She was phenomenal, and as for her character I thought they nailed it on the spot. I think they certainly choose the right kind of background for her character because it's very different aside from other sci-fi films.As for Jeremy Renner, he was great also, he was also the lead role in the movie HurtLocker, which was also an amazing film. His character is also very great and creates a great supporting character for the story. And honestly, the other actors were pretty solid as for acting, but there was some issues i had. One being the logic of the other characters in this movie. For example, the country leaders. They were by far the most delusional people in this movie. Lets be honest here, what can you do to an alien space craft? I doubt they can even make a scratch on UFO, come on its an Alien spaceship that is far more technical than anything we have today, so its best not to tick them off unless they show aggression... which they didn't. But, it is just a movie. OVERALL Its just an amazing movie I just kind of wished it was a bit longer and had a bit more settings, but despite the little tiny problems in this movie. I would give this a 10/10 considering that I went in with no expectations."

Than there's the problem of communication with the rest of the world,but that might not be too far from reality (its a dumb world we live in).It's kinda childish in my opinion.The ending is something special.On one hand,it's really powerful and interesting (it gave me the chills), but on the other,it's too unrealistic and that magical moment where Louise gets the knowledge from the alien really doesn't cut it for me,since it's a plausible situation in the future (until that moment) and a big problem if it does actually happen. Overall,even with some errors and a bunch of clichés, Arrival really got my attention and the acting of Amy Adams(at least should have got a nomination),as well as the plot,is really something special."
" Best fiction movie
",0.6369,0.939,2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"Last night I saw Arrival at TIFF and my mind was blown. This is by far Villeneuve's biggest film he has tackled yet with so many strong universal themes but yet also feels very emotional and intimate from the perspective of Amy Adams's character. Arrival is unlike any movie I've ever seen. It's about love, loss, tolerance, language and non-linear time, wrapped in a science fiction story about our first encounter with extraterrestrials. This movie is the best movie.Louise is lecturing at a university; twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear across the planet. U.S. Army Colonel Weber asks her to join a team, with physicist Ian Donnelly, to decipher their language and find out why they have come to Earth. The team is brought to a U.S. military camp in Montana near one of the spacecraft. They call two alien which is nicknames them Abbott and Costello. Louise discovers that they have a written language of complicated circular symbols, and begins to learn the symbols that correspond to a basic vocabulary. As she becomes more proficient, she starts to see and dream vivid images of herself with her daughter. When Louise is able to ask what the aliens want, they answer: ""offer weapon"". A similar translation ""use weapon"" is received by one of the other sites. Fear of a potential threat from the aliens leads other nations to close down communications on the project, and some prepare their military for attack. However, Louise thinks that the symbol interpreted as ""weapon"" might have an alternative translation, such as ""tool"" or ""technology"".Rogue soldiers plant explosives in the spacecraft. Unaware, Louise and Ian re-enter to communicate with Abbott and Costello again. The aliens give them a much larger and more complex message. Abbott ejects Ian and Louise from the craft as the explosion occurs, which leaves them unconscious.After Lan and Louise wake up, Ian works out that the symbols relate to the concept of time, and that it is one-twelfth of the whole ""gift""; they conclude that the aliens must want nations to cooperate.Louise rushes back to the spacecraft, which sends down a shuttle to take her inside. She meets Costello, who communicates that Abbott is dying. Louise asks about her visions of a daughter, and Costello explains that she is seeing the future, revealing to her that her ""visions"" were not flashbacks but flash forwards. Costello also communicates that they have come to help humanity by sharing their language, which is the ""weapon"" or ""tool"" because it changes the mind's perception of time. The aliens know that 3000 years into the future they will need humanity's help in return. They ask her to use her ""weapon"" - her ability to see into the future.Louise returns as the camp is being evacuated. Louise use her future power to know Shang's wife last words and she use to that to stop Shang's military power (China power). The planned Chinese attack is called off and the other nations resume contact with each other, as the spacecraft disappear from Earth.When packing to leave the camp, Ian admits his love for Louise. They discuss life choices, and whether they would change them if they knew the future. Louise foresees that Ian will father her daughter Hannah, whose name is an intentional palindrome, and leave her after discovering that she knew their daughter would die before adulthood. Despite also seeing that Ian will leave her when she eventually reveals their daughter's future, when Ian asks her if she wants to have a baby, Louise agrees."
" smart sci-fi

Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) asks her for translation help and she convinces him to join his contact group. She is paired up with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They are one of twelve teams around the world in contact with a separate spaceship. The aliens use a circular smoke-like writing system. Eventually, China leads several teams to confront the aliens.This is a change from the action-oriented sci-fi movies. It asks questions and challenges the audience. It's a mystery sci-fi. It is smart although I wonder if it could be even smarter. The reveal is nicely done. I want the writing system to be more profound and more easily connected in some way. The obvious comparison is the message in Contact and solving that message was a great revelation. This film is more murky and mysterious. The general sense is understandable but there needs to be an ah-ha moment in the audience translating the alien language. I can't give away any of it. Amy Adams does some good work. It's a beautiful film both visually and thematically. It's another solid film form Villeneuve."

" A movie about communication (and how the lack of it causes us problems)
",-0.3182,0.5182,2017-01-30 00:00:00,9,"A movie about communication (and how the lack of it causes us problems). A movie about how we interpret the other (the foreigner, the unknown, the visitor) based on our own language. Obviously this is how we establish contact, how we socialize. Languages offer us a way to make ourselves understood. The problem is that there is much more than we can express with our language systems. Moreover, when we try to understand the unknown through our language, we run the risk of misinterpreting the other.'Arrival' offers a reflection on the importance of immersing ourselves in the culture of the other when we want to understand it. It also allows us to question how our ability to think is limited by our language, our vocabulary, our communication tools. In addition, it brings the reflection about how today, more than ever, dialogues are extremely fundamental. A dialogue, when effective, allows us, in addition to getting out of our arrogant and strongly cemented ignorance, to reconcile the differences that characterize us as humans.Although I thought the movie was amazing and beautifully conceived, (and here I put a SPOILER ALERT) I disliked the way it painted China (and Russia to some extent) as a naive and inconsequential governance, performing acts that need to be corrected by the US. Beyond the philosophical conclusions of the film, the political outcome would be that the US would remain better prepared keep its leadership. Paradoxically, I thought that, given the character of the language that demanded translation, the Chinese would be far more successful in deciphering it than the Americans. Chinese ideograms and the way they embody concepts in their symbols are much closer to the language of visitors than our Western system. But finally, I'll leave such technical analyzes to those who really understand the subject."
" Best part is... it makes you want to read the book
",0.6705,0.9783,2017-01-30 00:00:00,9,"Every field of study needs its limelight in Hollywood, and this time it's linguistics. This film, directed by a French-Canadian, composed by an Icelander, and based on a Hugo award winning novella by Ted Chiang (a Chinese-American) depicts the complicated and geopolitically unstable circumstances that would arise if extra-terrestrial lifeforms suddenly appeared on our planet. At least, that's what it seems like on the surface. Underneath the typical Hollywood plot is a story with gripping philosophical and linguistic inquiries into the nature of reality. We find ourselves fascinated with each new discovery uncovered by the protagonist, an inquisitive linguist played by Amy Adams, as she begins to grasp the new Alien language. Included in her realizations are an unearthly way of perceiving time and a paradoxical new perspective on the issue of determinism vs. free will. Amazingly, the film never goes into annoying explication, despite the highly technical nature of the setting and the complexity of the plot line. The film always gives a strong taste without revealing too much. To some this might be annoying and confusing, to others (like myself) it might spur a relentless curiosity. After the film had ended I found an online copy of the book from which it's based. I would highly recommend others do the same. Though the visuals, effects, and cinematography of the film are enchanting, and overall it is masterfully made, the philosophical themes are far more engrossing in the novella. Ted Chiang has an incredible aptitude for conveying mind- blowing scientific, linguistic, and philosophical wonders in a few short sentences. Not to mention, the story of Louise's relation to her daughter is far more personalized as we get to see things from her mind's eye. The difference between the book and the film is seen most clearly in the titles. In ""The Story of your Life,"" the alien encounter is only a back drop to the story of Louise's daughter. Whereas, in ""Arrival,"" global turmoil and creepy alien encounters play front-and-center."

So if you like the other kind, slow paced, low-key, intellectual... then go watch Contact.Arrival draws a lot from Contact : themes, pace, plot elements. Both are stories where the big alien encounter mostly serves as a device to explore the psyche and emotions of a single human : the female lead role.At times, Contact managed to make you ponder about science and faith. In the end, Arrival, with more sets and more CGI, and a gripping dark atmosphere, will mostly make you think about its plot holes and shortcuts."

A lot of people talk about ""Independence Day"", but it was SO disappointing, one minute serious, the next minute, childish humor. And the original ""War of the Worlds"" - the Tom Cruise remake was pretty frightening too, but a little too much of the screaming little girl and disgruntled son. This movie was SO BAD, I had to take an ADDERAL to stay awake, and I NEVER fall asleep at the movies. There's NOTHING HERE, folks, no matter WHAT the king says he's wearing. I read 13 pages of the reviews here, and the ones who gave it a good rating were AS BORING AS THIS MOVIE. ""Look how intelligent I am, I really understood what the message was. I could be the next Elbert!"" Uh, no, no, and DEFINITELY NO. I sure do wish Roger were here, he would have warned me. If you really feel you must see it, WAIT UNTIL ITS ON T.V. AND SAVE YOUR MONEY.(And time, because you'll turn it off, pretty darn quick.) I wish I could have. Linda😀💩💩💩👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
" Intriguing Sci-fi movie, loved it!
",0.636,0.9718,2017-01-29 00:00:00,10,"I chose to watch this movie because of the review rating (8.2/10) and the actors. I'm so glad I did! This movie is slow but slow in a way that is thought provoking. I can understand how there are some reviews about it being boring, but really it's not. It was refreshing to not see a cheesy alien movie...which I was expecting. There is no unnecessary fighting, over the top special effects, or sex. I suggest watching this movie if you enjoy a story that takes time but always keeps you thinking of what's to come. There are so many things to reflect on in this movie. Plus, the actors were great! I'm very impressed with the variety of roles Amy can play. If you're looking for thought provoking sci-fi, this is a great one!"
" Let curiosity take control and enjoy this sci-fi masterpiece
",0.8074,0.9969,2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"'Arrival' was truly a wild ride. Honestly, I feel this will be a film to be remembered within the genre for years to come. While some fans of the genre may feel that Sci-Fi films should be filled with alien blasting action or deep adventure, 'Arrival' thrives off of the desire to understand and an all-around curiosity for not only what an alien species could do if they were to interact with human civilization but what human nature could do given if this situation were to happen. As an audience member, I found myself curious as to what was going to happen next within the story from start to finish. Although moving at what could be seen as a slow pace, it had this creative ""edge-of-your-seat"" feel to it as I anticipated anything to happen at any moment. If you are to view this film, I will warn you, curiosity and confusion can/will occur, but it only compliments the creativity within this film... Production wise, director Denis Villeneuve executes with suave perfection. With every passing moment, you can feel his influence in what he wanted each actor and actress to express with every movement and reaction. From as little as a simple gesture to the biggest line execution. A special nod goes to Bradford Young for the cinematography within this piece. There were scenes and moments within this films that looked utterly beautiful that blended so well with the vibe of the film. Leaving myself, personally, with stills and movie moments I will never forget as they were so interesting and creative to watch unfold.With the Sci-Fi Drama 'Arrival', expect curiosity to take over. It is a story to remember and debate/discuss with your friends for hours on end. A strong recommendation here from Oberrated and yet another worthy Oscar nomination.-- Oberrated.com --"
" When bored writers spend hours sipping coffee
",-0.2732,-0.8037,2017-01-29 00:00:00,1,"When you combine The Sixth Sense, Prometheus, A Beautiful Mind and Independence Day with coffee cup stains you arrive at err umm 'Arrival'! With a plot as solid as a soap bubble, we can but wonder, how it got nominated to the Oscars. The number of coffee cup stains you see on the screen is the number of movies it has derived inspiration from.Except for one scene that shows gravity drag, there was nothing impressive about the film (not a spoiler, it's on the trailers). If shivering can qualify as acting and a didgeridoo sounds alien, we can't help, but judge the imagination of the Director. After half a century, Hollywood has finally gotten bored of portraying Russia as it's arch enemy and have elevated China to this post. This movie would have been complete if they had thrown in some robots and zombies."
" Thought Provoking!!
",-0.3365,0.9729,2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"Wow! So far the Oscar movies are absolutely terrific and ARRIVAL is just as so. It deals with one of the most run-of-the-mill situations that has been portrayed several times in Hollywood-'The Arrival of extra terrestrials on earth.' However this approach is like nothing we've seen before. It is above the typical idea of extinction of the human race. It has a much more radical perspective (when I say this, I refer to the way they dealt with the situation, it was very human like)Each and every aspect of the movie is perfect right from the story to the acting. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner were brilliant as the leads. All the scenes were directed with a purpose that is easily understood. In each clip the audience is able to feel exactly what the director wanted to show. You are able to relate to the character's emotions and actions. As for the story we see that more than it just being scientific, a philosophical outlook is also shown. The soundtrack is a great asset of the movie. It amplifies the feels of each situation for the audience. Especially in the ending, surely it'll stay in your head a while. This movie is a must see. Everything you could possibly expect from it, it delivers on and does much more than that. SPOILERS: The only questionable scene of the movie was the part where they show Louise teaching the language of the aliens to a class. Now imagine a world where everyone knew the future, that would be madness. Certainly someone would want to change what they see, and that could only lead to chaos."
" Definitely NOT for everyone
",0.4019,0.1485,2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"Before I saw this film, I was baffled by how polarizing the user reviews were. Tens and ones, but very few in between. After seeing the film, I absolutely get it. Start by asking yourself if you enjoy the following movies. Sphere(1998). 2001: A Space Odyssey. Solaris(2002). If your answer is no to any of these, particularly those last two, do yourself a favor and watch something else. It would be insulting to call this the thinking person's movie, because I can think of a number of highly intelligent people that would not like this movie at all. It would be closer to say it is the extremely patient, thinking person's movie. The pacing reminded me of 2001, though it is not quite that slow. There is very nearly zero action in it, but a whole lot of highly thought provoking concepts that build over the course of the movie. For myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but I also understand the hate if you went and saw it, expecting something like Independence Day. In this movie, the battlefield takes place in the mind, and the heroes are the linguists and the mathematicians."
" Excellent and thought provoking
",0.4404,0.7222,2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"A film about aliens that deals with humanity . Taking on a very different approach to the usual sci-fi arrival themed alien movies where aliens are only after our resources and planet , Arrival explores multiple unseen aspects of what aliens might be like from appearance and origin to alteria motives hidden to us due to our humanity . Despite falling to the usual Hollywood theme of vilainizing foreign powers like China and Russia and portraying again the Americans as the only rational thinking country of the planet earth (Donald Trump seriously ? ) this movie is by far one of the best sci-fi thrillers/drama to date . Using hard science to back up its theories and understandings that we have acquired recently as a species about how space , time and the understanding of these variables tie together with the way we perceive the world , the movie stands apart from Alien invasion and VFX overload movies and delivers suspense and drama in a league of its own . Some call it slow going , however time is relevant."
" Yes
",0.4019,0.8845,2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"Arrival, like almost every single other film Director Denis Villeneuve, is a masterpiece. An incredibly intelligent script from screenwriter Eric Heiserrer gifts audience members a great take on a less-than-imaginative premise that could've been bland if handled incorrectly.Villeneuve is an astounding director, bringing us a tense and haunting atmosphere and squeezing captivating performances from actors Amy Adans and Jeremy Renner.A great score and masterful cinematography help round out the film.Renner said in an interview with Total Film that he believes Villeneuve to be a combination of Spielberg and Kubrick. I can't help but agree.This was, without a doubt, my favorite film of 2016.10/10"

",-0.5106,-0.3064,2017-01-28 00:00:00,3,"The content is actually sorta fine, but the horrible dialog where everyone just whispers and speaks 3 word sentences is just awful.It is a cool scientific-style subject which was neutered by over dramatization using impossible-to-guess secrets, whispers and unintelligible mumbling. Also, there is a disconnect between the music, which is too loud, and the whispered dialog. Impossible to watch in an apartment without waking up the neighbor.They could have done so much more with this movie instead of keeping everyone guessing for a reveal that never arrived.Thumbs down to the director."
" At a loss for words!
",-0.3802,0.988,2017-01-28 00:00:00,2,"Can't be any spoilers here, I couldn't watch it long enough to tell anyone what happens. I am at a loss here. I read the reviews and it is remarkable to see that people either hated this film and referred to it as a snooze-fest, or praised all the nuances from Amy Adams' acting to the musical score, to the message for humanity. Reminds me of the hype (I was a teenager at the time) for 2001 A Space Odyssey. I saw that and would have left after 20 minutes, but the friend I was with kept saying, no, let's wait, something has to happen soon. What a waste of time! I have never been so bored sitting through a movie. These days I don't have to - I can watch a lot on the internet and turn it off, or try again if I want to. This movie compares to 2001 - at least the first 45 minutes. I couldn't get past that, although I did try. Listening to Amy Adams hyperventilate in a dark tunnel for 10 minutes (at least it seemed that long) was like watching the spaceship from all angles just floating in space for what seemed like an eternity in 2001. I am not a fan of action movies, but total lack of anything is the opposite extreme, and just as bad. People loved to say I just didn't understand it. But who cares? It's like watching a mediocre golf match. It may be a pleasure to play and enjoy the weather, but not to watch unless you are in love with one of the players. Same here. Not a pleasure. A waste of film, time, actors, and anything else used to make the film. But then, that seems to be in these days. Don't get me started on LaLaLand . . . 'How do these movies get nominated for best picture?"

The director thought so as well, so he added the Cancer child, seeing in the future, and a bunch of other crap that really did not fit and mashed them all together to make this 2 hour snooze fest.I am Louise, she writes on a board with a magic marker for the alien to see, next time she writes i am Human on the board.. Ian was feeling left out so he joined in as well.. ""This is Ian i am walking now"" LOL cringe worthy script. Do yourself a favor skip this and watch CONTACT if you have not already,"

This film should, hands down, win the Oscar for Best Picture award (Please note that at this point in time, the results for the 2017 Oscars is not out yet). The film is constantly engaging and there is never a moment where I felt the film was draggy or boring. The plot twists come naturally and serve as a gimmick for the plot instead of a key element in the plot. I love the 'Memento' editing style of the film as it leaves room for the audiences to connect the dots. I never thought that Hollywood could handle an alien invasion film in this manner. All in all, it is definitely a film worth spending your money on to watch in the cinema.10/10"
" A tiny Rough Draft turned into a 2 Hour Movie
",0.0,0.9839,2017-01-28 00:00:00,1,"I looked forward to this movie after seeing the trailers. It looked like it would be filled with mystery and intrigue. What would the hidden plot be? What magical or devastating interactions were going to take place? Yes - that is what the trailers presented to us, but that is not what the film delivered. Not by a mile.I am afraid I have to agree with all the other 1 star ratings here. This was a bore fest at best. It was as if someone wrote a single paragraph rough draft of a possible plot line, and then without any creativity or imagination, the film makers somehow stretched it in to a 2 hour movie.Two hours to present something as simple as ""Gee - what if this happened?"" - ""Yeah - that would be nice I guess."" And presented poorly.In the hands of the right director with some vision and passion, and with good writers that could better develop scenes and backgrounds, this might have been a pretty good movie. Instead, it drags on with very little to capture the audience, and the ending - if you even understand it - is a major ""That was it??"" moment.What a shame."

The alien talk about humanity and help but doesn't explain them at all. I hate this movie for this, it's incomplete and waste of time.Also this movie showed unrealistic technology and development. They started understanding the alien language and developed a software to write the same in just a few days with hi-tech interface. Tech people are definitely going to stay the movie makers were idiots.The aliens wanted to give a weapon/technology and asked for human help in 3000 years. but didn't explain anything about that, total WASTE. The movie was missing logic everywhere, Louis can see the future in the movie but it has no good explanation in that regard.I want my refund, I have wasted my sweet 2 hours in this movie. I have no idea why this movie has a 8.2 rating on IMDb. it doesn't deserve more than 5 out of 10.Also, the movie showed Pakistan is helping USA, Pakistan cannot help themselves how come they can help the United States. A totally annoying part that was.I am not going to watch any movie from these movie producers and the story writer, i want to save my time.

" Don't hesitate--see this movie
",0.0,0.976,2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"I knew nothing about this film aside that involved aliens per the poster and trailer. I ended up seeing this movie for one reason (well two actually) only--the leads in the film. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are fast becoming my favorite performers of their generation. They are--surprising. Surprising in depth, surprising in how relate-able they are, surprising in how normal yet attractive they are.. and there are no disappointments here. They deliver......okay, enough with fawning over the leads.So the film--if you liked (or loved) Contact, you will LOVE LOVE LOVE this film. The story was clearly something that would appeal to me--I love a good scifi film and its my favorite genre. But this movie sidesteps the flaw that tends to grate on your nerves in the film (and book) Contact---the foibles of humanity coming to the surface when faced with contact with an EBE. Its not ignored in the film, its just a minor plot point rather than the point. Which is just fine with me because the main plot is fantastic.If you are into the Aliens/Prometheus version of scifi they you will probably be disappointed. No action, no scary space monsters picking off humans, no gore and no murder mayhem. In fact, after watching this film only one word seemed to capture it in my head. SMART. Its just a smart movie. The plot is really creative and I left the film feeling just like I did when I was a kid after seeing a good scifi film---I just wished that what I had just seen was really true. I will be seeing this movie again--its that good."
" The Day the Movie Stood Still
",0.0,0.9871,2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Or, Alive on Arrival.The first half of this movie wasn't bad, per se, but it did frustrate me. It showed, once again, how dumb we are. Humans with all its war, ego, greed, miscommunications, short-tempers and small-mindedness. To only take in the first half of this story is proving my point, including my own shortcomings. As a matter of fact, I kept wondering how on Earth did this get nominated for Best Picture?Isn't it obvious by now? Yeah, stick it through to the second half. Some people I know who have seen this state they didn't understand it. Didn't catch the answer to the one question this movie pounds into our head: ""Why are they here?"" I do not follow. I don't understand, even with the complexity the second half throws at us, the mission is actually pretty clear.Basically, the movie is about the military attempting to communicate with an alien race of 12 ships that hover over random spots. In comes (the fantastic performance by Amy Adams who plays) Louise and Ian (the normal, expected and welcomed acting job of Jeremy Renner) who work as a linguist and scientist duo to communicate with the aliens. It's not a quick process, especially when they have to deal with different gravity, beings, barriers and, of course, languages. But the military and governments are impatient. I suspect some movie watchers are, as well.Like I made evident, stick with it. It becomes clear and amazing. With as much dirt as they throw at the human race, the movie reveals itself as an eye-opener. I have given too much away. My point is: watch this to the end and let the script tell you a marvelous story. It's slow, unabashedly at times. Maybe a little too realistic. But, it gave me hope that my own secret sci-fi fantasies could come true. Hint: Voyager.***Final thoughts: It's not a movie I would watch repeatedly. In fact, I have no idea (currently, but maybe they do.) when I will see this again. That said, I am super glad I did see it and wish this could really happen. We need this. WE REALLY DO."

They definitely got the right people to play the characters. Amy Adams really performed her character as if she was her character. As you are watching it you are trying to figure it out with the characters and once the end comes then you just sit there for three minutes with your jaw hanging open while you are trying to figure it out. This movie is nominated for Best Picture and it really deserves it. This is the only movie worth the Best Picture in my opinion. This movie is definitely a must see. It is definitely worth the ten stars.
" Really overrated...

The whole thing takes an eternity to build up as much as the lead actress which I found terrible. Her incapability to say more than two meaningful words up until the middle/upper-middle part of the movie really kills to whole dynamic of the movie.Many scenes did not make sense like the ability for the undersea creatures to understand Latin characters, suddenly, out of nowhere, like as if these experts and military really needed Amy Adams to have figured that out, using a few-two baby insignificant words. They had all sorts of complex equations but it never really crossed their minds that they could grasp ""Human"", really? And, I'm not even sure the scene which follows after this specific sequence needs a comment.Well, people might ask why I call them undersea, it's because they are a crossroads joke between Octupus, a cuttlefish throwing nasty black ink all over the place and a crab. For that matter, the analogy makes even more sense since these things seemed to be based in an aquarium protected by a sealed glass wall, floating and making some weird crustacean noises [...] I'm not really sure how the real aliens in the out there feel about this caricature. Additionally, the main action scenes are fundamentally slow and boring.I did not really understand the connection between Amy Adams' life with her daughter and the undersea creatures. The movie consistently tried to drive that focus in parallel with the main plot but I found it to be entirely unnecessary and perhaps used as a filling for the complete lack of interest that the main story is supposed to drive.Seriously, if you're not into Hume or Niesztze type movies, you might probably want to skip this whole thing all together. These kinds of movies are for scholars and researchers, and, while I myself have reached far in studies, I don't watch movies to the same thing I do in university, hence why I failed to take any pleasure in this.

" The Hateful 8 (I mean 7) out of 10
",-0.4939,0.983,2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Arrival wasn't what I was expecting and I understand how some people are rating it as a dud, but even though it played at quite a slow pace it was still engaging throughout and reminded me of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other similar films.The aliens invading earth scenario was a side-show to the past/future/present life of the lead character played by Amy Adams, which was a cheap trick actually to make a sedate film seem more interesting, and only really served to give the film more punch than similarly fantastical moral-dilemma films like Tree of Life or The Fountain, which failed even more than Arrival did. Arrival was much better than those, but not a sci-fi film in the traditional sense of the word.Arrival is, however, a film you can watch a second or third time from an entirely different perspective because of what you didn't know at the beginning or during the film itself, and with retrospect it enables you to appreciate the acting and aspects of the film you'd overlooked before.Even with retrospect, Arrival isn't a fantastic film because there isn't enough going on and there are too many repeat build-up scenes which makes it plod, but it's still a good watch for the patient viewer who likes to think about their material after the final curtain closes.The haters are out in force though so this review is going to get '0 out of 10 people found this useful', I suspect. Then again, I think Solaris is a wonderful film, so what do I know?"
" Sobs of sadness...for a lost opportunity
",-0.4588,-0.575,2017-01-27 00:00:00,3,"I don't understand - how hard was it to consult an actual linguist? You know, before making a sci-fi movie about one? How hard was it to show the script to some producers and curators of actual sci fi to make sure you don't look like a total dolt? I am glad to see many folks who hated this movie have placed it alongside Inception as over-hyped pseudo-intellectual garbage, and called it out on its needless reliance on cheap, Lifetime-esque human drama in the same vein as Interstellar. I'll hatefully add A.I. to that list, because it's the first sci-fi movie I remember to feature such blatant maudlinism in a cheap attempt to make a festering pile of vomit seem as profound as an actual, non- metaphorical festering vomit pile on a sheet of acid. ""Who is this child?"" indeed.Now that I think of it, the plot device rendering AI's ending so particularly odious - thus imbuing it with the emotional equivalent of claws on a chalkboard - was so laughably implausible by even a (non-American) grade school attendee's standards that it could safely be called ""magic"". In AI's case, it was magic math. And here too, we have the kernel of a decent sci-fi concept wrapped in a greasy wad of inconsistencies, and globbed together with scum-globs of scientific incompetence. Falls apart on every layer like a moldy onion, and tries to make you pay for it with tears. I give three stars for ""Abbott"" and his alien buddies. They did alright, considering the sheer stupidity they were up against, both in the actual movie and behind its creative process."

",0.0,-0.9169,2017-01-27 00:00:00,4,"I really expected this will be some masterpiece after seeing trailers, reading some announcements. And I really like intelligent Sci-Fi. Only that it is very rare achievement, and sadly this one is just not Sci-Fi at all in fact. There is nothing from Sci in it. Could write here long list of nonsense, may say even lazy writing. Will just discuss few: that invitation of Louise by Colonel was total non realistic, even for Hollywood standards. Then, that climbing up in alien (apropo - why was it big thing when Louise called them first ""aliens"" ?) ship and whole solution to welcome humans there was pathetic. Of course, all it was just setup for later explosion scene - practically only action part of movie, but left me total cold, because it was so unreal and forced.They should explain, give background for many things - at least give 1-2 minutes about people who placed explosive there. And no way that Louise and Donnelly did not notice in 4 minutes those big red LED downcounters. Then came that ""use weapons"" nonsense part, what should be some climax - but it was too early, and my first thought was that Louise would not say it to military people (in real World, events) - especially not because was not sure that it is proper translation. That is indeed the weakest part of movie - just forced, not good written. And whole idea about different sense of time, seeing the future is utter crap. I'm sorry, but that is not possible, and more important, they should not go in whole dying child thing there - which mother would not try anything to save her child ? This was just too extreme case. Was the point in that even she knew the outcome, she went in ""let's make child"" thing ? - my God, this was even so primitive ...Much better movie could be made with just this as main theme: Girl can see the future and dying kid, abandoning husband, just meets him on work, and they make family, but then the classic question: is future determined ahead (fate) or we can do something to change it ? And of course, normal mother would do everything to save her child. Now, that would be something, even if maybe seen already. This was just attempt to make something new - new type of encounter, aliens. Most of things were just to impress viewer on emotional base, but it just worked not in my case, and may say not by most of viewers. Too bad for director and really good main actors."
" Kangaroo
",0.0,0.9967,2017-01-26 00:00:00,9,"""Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating,"" scoffs Jim Carrey's lovelorn protagonist in 2004's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. He'd get right along with Amy Adams' linguistics specialist, Dr. Louise Brooks, from Denis Villeneuve's Arrival. Like Eternal Sunshine, it's a elegant, grounded but stylized portrait of grief and profound communication breakdowns amidst an almost-plausible science-fiction landscape. However, Villeneuve's film also makes its mark as one of the most haunting, introspective, and tautly, fiendishly clever films of the last several years. Like most of the best sci-fi, Arrival is not really 'about' the aliens it introduces (don't worry, that's not a spoiler), but rather what they draw out in the humans whose lives they enigmatically appear in sans explanation. Their monolithic, oblong spaceships peppering the planet not only contribute to the pantheon of evocative sci-fi imagery, but also serve as handy ciphers for social commentary. To many, they're instantly a threat, or superfluous beyond their potential for extraterrestrial weaponization (or both), and there's a chortle to be had in how unsurprising it is the film plays out amidst the cradle of stifling U.S. military bureaucracy. But screenwriter Eric Heisserer also neatly weaves in the story of Dr. Brooks, anchoring the macro conflict on her own personal interactions with the aliens as a focal point and refuge from her own almost vegetative loneliness and grief. He and Villeneuve allow Brooks' own drama to teasingly dance amidst the global histrionics, with the key conflict not being the extraterrestrials demanding to be taken to our leader, but our wishing we shared the vocabulary to express such sentiments beyond the mysterious Rorschach test ink blots they spew, like union negotiations told through smoke rings. Fittingly, in a film revolving around communication, Villeneuve is coy about showing his film's thematic and narrative hand too early. Planting firmly in the Close Encounters of the Third Kind school of mature, muted sci-fi, Villeneuve practically cackles with delight in exploiting every (good) trick in nonlinear storytelling book, using masterful editing to unspool wrinkles of story that carry unexpected waves of devastation and devastating hope. Here, Heisserer's screenplay is clever to a fault in its lean simplicity, finding power and poignancy in stark images (Brooks reveals that the Chinese military have been teaching the aliens to communicate through mah-jong, thereby establishing an inherently adversarial dynamic), with even certain lines that initially play as clunky instead proving to be red herrings, retroactively revealed as urgent clues and secret foreshadowing. It's unquestionably a slow-burner, with Villeneuve's pacing remaining firmly steady throughout, which, at times, grates against the brewing sociopolitical state of emergency, and a clinical feel that at times verges on excessively emotionally sterile. Still, the film's masterfully precise technical prowess alone makes the film worth viewing in cinemas. Bradford Young's dreamily gliding cinematography, composer Jóhann Jóhannsson's whimsically, playfully twinkling score, and some of the most unerringly spot-on sound editing in recent memory (to say nothing of the gorgeous scenic filming locations) all conflate to establish a blanket of eerie serenity amidst the global chaos. It's a fishbowl feeling that Villeneuve stirs from restlessness into deliberate claustrophobia in the final act, but, by gosh, if an audience is to be trapped in a fishbowl, it may as well be a fishbowl as beautiful as this. Many leading actors working amidst such old-school sci-fi would have succumbed to the temptation to punch up the disquieting calmness with heavy-handed scene- stealing. Thankfully, Amy Adams is a far wiser and intuitive performer than that. Her work here is exceptional in its quietness, her subtle ebb of emotions throughout seeping into the viewer like a gentle rain flecked with the lightning surges of her perilously fleeting interactions with her daughter. She abjectly avoids any Oscar- baiting melodrama in favour of simply embodying Brooks like a comfortable slipper, making it one of the most affecting and truthful performances of a woman in pain we've seen in some time. Conversely, Jeremy Renner gives a sturdy performance throughout, but he's so bland and indistinct that his casting as a character too easily regulated to expositional fountain is instantly forgettable. Nonetheless, Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg each excel at no-nonsense resonance as the commander and PR exec of the governing military, their strained and often contradictory grimness exposing the lion's share of social commentary. ""What is your purpose here?"" is the guiding question for Brooks and her team. Arrival's is far less reticent. It's a story about a mother and her daughter. It's a story about a planet learning to listen. And it's a story about how time and love are the only truly reliable concepts, but not necessarily in that order. Like its depicted otherworldly visitors, Arrival is distinctly odd and discomfortingly tranquil, but stirringly mesmerizing, supremely clever, and surprisingly rewarding. Most of all, it's unassumingly unforgettable, and primed to take its place amidst the great science- fiction of the era. -9/10"

Not so much.Good acting, good cinematography but not anything we haven't seen before. Alien pods, world chaos, military intervention and a code breaker who let's us all know the ET's come in peace. Where have I seen that before?? Oh, yes, the gazillion Sci-fi films before this one.Oh yes and Adams can also break through time, saving the world from another major world war by whispering in some Chinese diplomats ear.Well we already know time is non-linear so no big revelation there and the idea that Adams (who plays a professor in the film) has all this high level top secret military clearance is a stretch.It's not a horrible film yet it's not a great film. I felt entertained yet somewhat unfulfilled. Wishy-washy at best.I wouldn't recommend it to friends unless there is nothing else worth watching. So it's a good filler film if you're bored and have nothing better to do."

I have to say that I think this is a much more realistic portrayal of what would happen if an intelligent species showed up here. The concepts here are thought provoking and so intelligently written I just can't stop my mind from playing the ""What if"" game. You know... what if that happened and you could really do that and then this.... As a Spiritual person and an eclectic Pagan I am really excited by the trend in movies to show how connected the universe really is! This flick makes you take a look around and step up to the universe's calling to do better in the world. To prove that as a species, we are capable of learning that the universe is connected and we have to be good to each other, our planet, and beyond! I hope everyone watches this movie!"

Makes a lovely stab at realism. Keeps us in suspense and entertained all the way. Is Different. Is simple but yet complex and makes us think. Has no hero per say, but warms to humanity in a way that only few films can. Its a study of mind and heart. But most of all, its tense; It flips through time like no other film I have seen but maintains interweaving effortlessly. The script is brilliant, the acting is brilliant, the music is brilliant, and the story more than satisfies. I think this is a masterpiece."
" Totally Unbelievable and Unconvincing. Stay Away!
",0.3367,0.9368,2017-01-26 00:00:00,3,"Like many others here, I was expecting so much more from ""Arrival"", particularly with Amy Adams in the lead. She is usually a very fine actress and I don't blame her for the stupid piece of work that this movie turned out to be. She would have had little if any influence over what finally appeared on screen. And Forest Whitaker, whose presence here seems quite unnecessary, hasn't really done anything good since I saw him first in ""The Crying Game"" all those years ago.Now, let me state that I am quite a fan of sci-fi movies. ""Contact"" with the wonderful Jodie Foster was much better than this load of sh*t and even Close Encounters, for its time, was a much better movie. As Alien movies go, nothing even comes close to the first ""Alien"" from 1979 (all of the sequels to that one were crap, as sequels almost invariably are).""Arrival"" just annoyed me. I'm not stupid and I think I understand the circular concept of time thing here which could be the only even remotely plausible explanation for how Louise suddenly, and quite inexplicably, figured out all on her own how to communicate with the OOMOTs (Octopuses/Octopii Minus One Tentacle) as I choose to call the aliens here.I quite agree with others about the utter implausibility of much of this movie. The sudden and inexplicable ability to understand and communicate with the OOMOTs, the decisions possibly about the future of mankind being made by one General after a phone call with the Secretary Of Defence (that's Defense for you Americans out there), what was the favour that the OOMOTs were going to ask for in 3000 years and who was going to be tasked to remember the commitment if given.Sorry, ""Arrival"" was just stupid and a huge disappointment. I was left thinking much the same as I thought after ""Birdman"" (also a seven character title). WTF is all the fuss about? How can anyone find this crap convincing or satisfying?I'm just glad that I bought ""Arrival"" on a cheap DVD in Thailand rather than paying good money to see it in a cinema or buy it on a proper DVD or Blu-ray.Stay away from this one people and watch something worthwhile instead. Almost anything is better.JMV"

Indeed it. I have to realize that the film is well directed. The soundtrack is perfect, almost alienating ?! The flaw script sometimes, but it does not disturb. And Amy Adams fit, beautiful and enthralling (and this comes from someone who has never convinced on). I'm not going to dwell much on the plot: the aliens arrive and we try to communicate with them. It 'a simple idea, but I bet that the film failed because the original idea is so trivial to us a b-movie; No. Succeeded because it involves the viewer, drags him into a story in time and space, the humanity island, upsets him trying to approach a philosophical inquiry to the dimension of language, attracts the mystery, fills him full circle of the film as if writing they were the same eptapodi."

This is truly one of those films where one regrets the loss of an hour and a half of one's life to watch such dross. The story, such as it was, could be scribbled on the side of a fag packet for all the depth that it had. As for the rave reviews Amy Adams is getting, I can only ask ""why""?

" Great movie about being human (contains spoilers)
",0.6249,0.9906,2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"It's been a long time since I've walked out of a theater thinking my life has been enriched, and since I've been so in awe of the subtlety and beauty presented on the screen. ""Arrival"" had that effect for me.This is a captivating movie about first contact with aliens and how humans handle our fear of the unknown and go about establishing communication. It's a huge concept, and yes, it's been explored before. I think ""Childhood's End"" by Arthur C. Clarke is the prototype most other stories follow to some degree.It's completely serious even though life is funny: ""Trust me, you can understand communication and still end up single."" There are so many clichés involved with ""first contact"" by now that it's hard to avoid all of them. This film has a few. But one of the things I like is that when the aliens leave, it's not in a flash of light and thunder, nor a streak of stars, nor any other display of massive power -- they just fade into clouds and mist. These aliens don't need to impress us with pyrotechnics.Another thing I like is the low-key approach that Amy Adams' character uses to establish communication. There are no hysterics, just quiet competence mixed with brilliant insight. The first word she uses in reaching out is ""human."" And that leads to the real surprise -- when it turns out that the aliens are just a side story! This is really a story about time, and our perception of time as we sort out the sequence of events in the film. But most of all, it's a story about the strength of a mother's desire for and love of her child -- and the decision to have the child even when she knows the child will not live a normal life. It's about what it means to be human and why humanity survives: To be human is to love and to love our kids. Any parent will get this."

Would they enlist an entourage comprised of a Linguistcs expert & a physicist, or would they push Trump into the vessel as a peace offering? Only the United States can save the world. *note no question mark at end of sentence* Forrest Whitaker is taking jobs away from Laurence Fishburne? Could a moment of world peace and unity sustain for 3,000 years? If languages can give us the ability to see through time, but you cannot alter or avoid an event on your time-line... wait, doesn't the ability to foresee the future already affect your decisions in the past? What happens to people who learn the language-of-Circles, but they are also clinically absentminded and forgetful to begin with? Will they then never have trouble finding their keys and never lose their wallets? Can the Language-of-Circles help cure Dementia and some of the symptoms to Alzheimers disease?Wouldn't the ability to look into the future completely destroy the gaming industry and wipe out casinos and lotteries around the world? Does Linguistics icon Noam Chomsky approve of the movie ARRIVAL? Would Terrence Malick (director of TREE OF LIFE & THE THIN REDLINE) watch this film and say to himself, ""damn, this is like one of my movies!""

The cast with the Hollywood darling Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker seems to be promising. The sci- fi theme first encounter with aliens is highly attractive. Unfortunately the (short) story is awful; maybe adequate for a short but never for a feature. The unknown Eric Heisserer wrote the screenplay of ""Arrival"" with 1h 56 min running time based on the awarded short ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang. The result is one of the most boring and pretentious movies ever made. It is funny to see Amy Adams' character pointing herself out and telling ""Human"" to the visitors in her first contact. On the next one, she does exactly the same gesture and tells ""Louise"" to the same visitors. They might have understood very well what she is trying to say. It is also hilarious her behavior toward the army, as if she were a general. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""A Chegada"" (""The Arrival"")"

",0.0,0.9805,2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"The thing interests me most was the symbolic meaning of communication between aliens and the linguist. The communication of different races. I guess that is the intriguing part of sci-fi to me. With the current political and culture clashing of the world, it serves as a refuge of writers - artists even who holds the romanticised view of the world - harmony between races and cultures. The duration of the plot could be seen as a journey of humanity develops a common language of unity. (this could be linked to the circle shape of the alien language)The screenplay explores the grant concepts as individual life, in this case the main character's life - a middle aged American woman and expands towards the life of a human being. From a perspective of an alien entity, it offers an observation of standing outside the circle (it is called in the movie 'non-linear') hence evoke viewers to stand at a philosophical point for the delivery of the essence of the movie, of the plot of the novel even, raising the question: would you still go through life if you've seen it from start to finish.The delivery of the images reminds me of how Terrence Malik does it in 'Into the Wonder' with a clever handling of memory flashbacks of the main character. Denis Villenueve is new to me and a happy finding. I like the way he deals with delivery so will go to see his upcoming films.Amy Adam is always earthy, I guess this is why she charms her fans. She excellently portraits American scholars and the spirit of them. Her earthy charm steals the show.Brilliant introduction of the novelist Ted Chiang, despite the numerous awards he receives out of his eight novels he managed to deliver us a story line and not losing the spirit of sci-fi."
" One of the big disappointments this year.
",-0.4588,0.9915,2017-01-24 00:00:00,4,"Straight to the point, its boring as Shiite, i swear more than half of the people left the theater 30 minutes before it ends and i was just sitting there waiting for that amazing moment that will justify the ticket price but no it did not come.With all these positive reviews, i was expecting a masterpiece similar to maybe Space Odyssey, Alien or at least to be as good as cloverfield lane but Jesus in my opinion that movie was really really awful.The whole story revolve around the arrival of Aliens to planet earth, and how humanity will be going to react against what it might seems a threat, a good idea for a movie sure, but executed in the most irritated way possible. You think that maybe the movie will talk about interesting stuff such as u know , the advanced technology part, from where they came, how do they live, how do they breed or at least their intentions but no,the whole two hours were about establishing a communication method between humans and the Aliens and that's it. On top of that, by the end ,the whole plot wont make any sense, its very much like trying to communicate physics with a Chinese person that he knows only Chinese and u know only English with no possible way to use signals or anything and somehow make it work.The casting was average at best, except for Amy Adams where she managed to stand out among the average lot.The special effects were good at some parts, there were few clever camera angles but nothing really that can be labeled ""impressive"".Nothing memorable in the sound department, many other movies even video games had a better scores and sound effects.In short,do yourself a favor and don't waste your money, its not about the movie being slow paced or having no explosions or any clichés like that no, its just does not make any sense and boring to a painful level."

You can imagine as you're watching it all the people who are frustrated with things like conceptual/hypothetical thinking just squirming in their seats when forced to deal with their own shallow incompetence. The ""Duh, I don't get it, it's got no plot derrrr""...""I don't understand this mumbo-jumbo liberal stuff!"" people with the inability to follow a movie unless it's spelled out for them every 5 minutes, is especially interesting for a movie like this because well, those would be the folks wanting to ""blow it up"" cause of they fear and want to kill things I can't understand or control. Basically, Trump voters...you know, Morons.People who can't follow this movie without a seeing eye dog and find it ""boring"" are those who probably don't read anything other than twitter feeds and chain restaurant drive through menus. I know it's frustrating because of the lack of ""spolsions"" or gratuitous T&A shots, but it's a sci-fi drama folks. Please do us all a favor and stick to the remedial level Fast and Furious, Ron Burgundy, or Kung Fu Panda flicks when you decide to choose a movie to watch so we don't have to sort through every other review being a 1-star rated 3rd grade hill billy comment that includes the one word you use often that you think makes you appear intelligent but you either spell it incorrectly, or use it wrong.That said; they did need to better explain and tie up the lose ends. I know they kind of left it open to interpretation and the film probably ran longer than they wanted but leaving it hang was kind of frustrating. What ""unstoppable"" disease killed her daughter, what was the help humans would give to the Heptapods? Why were the Heptapods ultimately there for? Was it solely to give them the gift of non- linear time so they can help them as well? Other than that, I enjoyed the basic story line and the direction for the most part, as well as the acting.

They have the technology to come a gazillion light years to visit and have likely done this countless times, and we have to be the ones to make the relationship work. This movie needs a counselor.As for the aliens, was there anyone who helped draw up this script that thought outside the box of creative thought. Just another alien movie where the writers drew too heavily on what WE know. An alien movie should start from what we don't know and the questions we have about what we don't know. Or, better yet, take a look at some drawings of 3 year-olds. They are more creative than this. Throw in the usual protagonist and antagonist plot and we discover what again? Nothing, except Hollywood scripts of this kind always have to highlight the evils of humanity and those damn reminders on how government can really screw up anything!I'm going to watch E.T. next time I need my alien fix.

",0.0,0.9843,2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Not to be confused with 'The Arrival' with a young Charlie Sheen, although both of these films involve visitors from another planet, the simply titled 'Arrival' takes the alien invasion genre into paths that we've never traveled down before. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Enemy, Prisoners, Sicario), instead of giant cities falling to the ground and millions of people disintegrating into thin air by a laser beam, 'Arrival' follows the path of two people who want to find a way to communicate with the new aliens that have seemed to land at twelve different locations on planet Earth. Set in present day, multiple giant alien spacecrafts land on Earth, where the governments around the globe put their best and brightest on the job to try and communicate with the new visitors.Stateside we have Louise (Amy Adams) and brilliant mathematician Ian (Jeremy Renner) teaming up with the army led by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to actually go inside the spaceship and try and communicate with the aliens by trying to learn their language and writing. Of course, the ultimate goal of almost everyone on Earth is to find out two questions from the aliens, which are ""Why they are here and What do they want?"" Over the course of several months, Ian and Louise communicate with basic language skills with the aliens in order to try and figure out why these twelve spaceships have landed on Earth.Villeneuve always gives an honest look at how we might react to this, by sprinkling the backgrounds with news pundits covering looting and politicians giving their two cents in. The real underlying story is with Louise and the loss of her young daughter to cancer, which we find out in the first scene of the film. Her coping and flashbacks to her daughter play a key role in moving on with life and trying to find an answer as to ""Why"". The film goes down a brilliant rabbit hole as to why the visitors are here on Earth and what their intentions are.There is a mix of senses that Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer incorporate throughout 'Arrival' that plays to your pleasures and fears on a very emotional level. You won't see burned buildings or people running and screaming or even the White House being blown to bits here. Instead, you will get an excellent and very original take on the alien invasion that has a ton of heart and soul with some grounded, yet excellent performances by everyone involved. This is one of the top sci-fi films in a long time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Where did the explosives come from that they used to blow up the ship? Why did they let Louise and Ian go up in the ship as the timer was counting down from 10 minutes? Didn't the two of them see that there was a bunch of explosives everywhere during their last session with the aliens? Just standing around when the bomb blows up.3. What the frack could Louise have said to the Chinese General to make him stop his attack? Aside from this, it was the longest 2 1/2 hours I've ever sat through.

Here are the top three things I enjoyed about the movie:Amy Adams. She delivers a beautiful performance as a passionate linguistics professor, who is recruited to communicate with the alien species. Adams delivers an endearing and realistic performance. My second favorite part of this film is the science behind the story. Arrival explores the sciences of language and communication and sheds light on a subject that is often remiss, and yet, is essential to humanity. And finally, the concept of time and how it is portrayed in the film. The film's unclear time line (that becomes perfectly clear by the end) beautifully demonstrates the complexity of time and questions our perceived conceived ideas of its functions."

",0.6249,-0.875,2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Facing the arrival of 12 alien ships to different parts of the world, the American army claims the linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams), so that she can understand their language and discover why they have arrived on Earth and if they pose a threat. During her foray into the military camp and her various contacts with the aliens, Banks will have as main companion the scientist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Reener); also during his stay, Banks suffers different flashbacks in which he recalls harsh moments with his deceased daughter. However, while the US military is patient with the ship in its territory, China and Russia are in very close positions to attack the ships that are in their countries, at the risk of a possible counteroffensive by the aliens to with the planet.With this movie, Villeneuve takes his first contact with science fiction before the great challenge that is in filming: the sequel to Blade Runner. In the first half of the film, we can say that he has done it sublime, photography and sound effects during the first incursion to the alien ship, the Canadian director takes us to a stage of tension and intrigue. A disturbing staging with Kubrick echoes that becomes risky due to its temporal phenomena reminiscent of the end of Interstellar, which may cause many viewers not to find a logical solution at the end of the film. This film is strange, poetic and incites to the reflection, a tape of little action, minimalist and with great atmosphere."
" I don't like paradox cop outs for endings
",-0.2057,0.9794,2017-01-21 00:00:00,5,"The movie is great at keeping your attention to the screen but that doesn't make this a great movie. There's just too many plot drivers which run on ""for the sake of it"".Yes OK she is learning their language and so unlocks the ability to access the past, present and future memories at will but hang on an entire team of people are deciphering and learning that language too. I'll have to watch the movie again but doesn't she start having the visions with very little understanding of the language? I just generally have an issue with paradoxes when they are used to end a movie which is on a difficult position of resolving the issue they currently face.In arrival the future chat with General Shang is on the basis of her having already made the call and told him his wife's dying words. Time being non linear or not you cannot gain information that you have 0 access to so that you can give that information conveniently to yourself.The daughter. This is such a sensitive topic but ultimately one thing I am certain of is that she has no right of withholding her knowledge about their, not hers only, their daughter from Ian. Plus it looks like knowing fully how he will react when she, and I'm assuming this is why they are apart, tells him about the disease after the daughter is born she is probably going to do that anyway too.Overall this movie is not smart it is just great at keeping a mystery not worth knowing."
" A movie with no ending.
",-0.296,0.9763,2017-01-21 00:00:00,5,"This movie starts out great. Aliens arrive, and we have to talk with them. You really feel drawn into the struggle to reach an understanding, ala ""Contact"".But there are some glaring places where suspension of disbelief falls apart.Other countries start to somehow ""feel threatened"" and given an ultimatum to the aliens before they start shooting. But there is no good reason given for why other countries would feel this way. There is some mention in the translation of ""weapon"", but the aliens have done nothing aggressive that we are shown. So it is hard to believe that suddenly anyone would be keen on blowing the aliens out of the sky when they have done nothing aggressive and no one can understand them yet.It's also hard to believe that such an incredibly advanced civilization would have difficulty communicating with humans. It should have been incredibly easy to settle upon agreed symbols for YES and NO within the first couple of days. These are pretty, dare I say, ""universal"" concepts. So once you have yes and no down, getting to some basic intentions of the aliens, like showing them an animated cartoon of one of the alien ships blowing away Earth ala The Death Star should have been pretty easy to get a yes or no answer to from the aliens.But, we can overlook these things as ""just the way they are in this movie"".But then just past the half way point we finally get the idea that the understanding the language alters your perception of time. It dawns on the viewer that Louise's flashbacks are actually flash-forwards.But then...nothing is done with that fodder, other than a reveal that Louise uses her future knowledge to get information from the Chinese general to stop their attack in the present.But it's not made clear what would have compelled the General to give her the information in the future in the first place. He just whips out his cell phone and gives her his private number but says he doesn't know why.Huh? And then the entire purpose of a sci-fi movie - some kind of resolution between the humans and the aliens - is waved away. We are given this snippet that the aliens will need human help 3000 years from now, and then they leave.Huh? That's it? We don't learn any awesome insightful stuff from the aliens? We just get a time language? It was a huge letdown.I was expecting some scene like the father-daughter scene from Contact where we are given some kind of vision of the future, that there are lots of species out there and this has gone on for billions of years, etc. etc.Arrival gives you none of that.I think the move really set out to be an anti-nationalist global Kumbaya with global military leaders being mindless thugs ready to blast the aliens for no good reason. That's about all it really does well."

I would never watch this movie ever again.

So often Aliens are portrait as menacing, killing, and total destructive way. This movie saw a more considered way. It was beautifully done. The deeper meanings, connections, peace, patience and oneness, was not only thought provoking but touching. If your expecting a guns blazing alien war film, this is not it. Try not to over think the film as you watch and guess where it's going but let it take you on the journey. The only recent sci-fi I could compare it too is interstellar though this is better. The acting and cinematography is excellent as is the soundtrack. If we ever encounter another life form, this is how I would hope it to turn out"
" Not a particularly good sci-fi
",-0.3865,0.5285,2017-01-21 00:00:00,5,"Well, the film wasn't that bad. It was however pretentious but it lacked the human drama, ethical decisions or any deeper meaning for that matter. It was slow paced, shallow, illogical and it finally ended up nowhere. Its major merit is that there aren't many Sci-fi films and I enjoy the genre. Wasn't a complete disaster but it is irritating that it is trying so hard, and there is no smart trick in the plot. It is exploiting the different time lines theme and this is almost always a trap for lots of reasons - basic or no scientific knowledge and understanding, bad adaptation or screenplay. This is usually insulting the intelligence of the audience, but I guess the high rating says a lot about this audience."

But, scenario became a little fuzzy and unrealistic in the second half.The scenario problems:1- Each sapient species has to have a grasping hand or something similar to build tools. So, the creatures in the movie should have evolved with grasping hands or something equal to that. The octopus like arms wouldn't work. Also, they need to have large brain relative to their body mass.2- A creature having faster than light technology is like, cave men versus 21. century tanks. So, armies in the world should be more careful than the movie. 3- Understanding of a language can't make you see the future and past together. It's not a problem of understanding, it's a problem of the physics.Movie started good, but it could be more realistic ending."

As usual the USA is the only country in the world with any brains, the other countries trying to figure out the aliens have no idea, they portray the Aussies as a bit unintelligent lets say.

If you look deep you may notice some protest, even rebel against the reign of positive sciences in every walk of life, and a yearning for place among world's elites. Because this movie exactly depicts this: promotion of a handful of highly educated, highly skilled linguists -Louise being one of them- to top positions in world affairs as only they can make use of a sophisticated language with weapon-like power. Now, this cheesy plot feels like a sure way to a disastrous movie, but here it isn't, thanks to masterful directing and monumental performance of Amy Adams.

" Clear and beautiful interpretation with extra terrestrials
",0.7579,0.999,2017-01-21 00:00:00,9,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.In some movies (often high rated ones) there is a sense and/or something in the beginning that gives away that this motion picture probably in the view of the majority will hit the rate far up and deliver an extraordinary experience for the viewer. Arrival is one of them. As soon as the melancholic, sad, professional and heavy violin starts off to a voice telling its truth in an almost grieving way, I thought and felt; OK...I got it... here they start off with great expectations. This is going to be one of those....Arrival is the movie about extra terrestrial contact through 12 enormous air crafts from the universe making it's way to earth. Displaying a interpreters' work in speaking with them. This is intact. This is interesting. This is tense. And for them that are interested in an innovative experience. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) travels through emotional and logic senses trying to solve the language to get to the point: What is your purpose here? A beautiful, thoughtful and slow paced motion picture about contact and visitation of another life form from... somewhere. Made with such grace and deep feeling that it up rises a different new type of era in the ""science fiction"" genre... or...how long will it be science fiction? Just the scene with the explosion done in some kind of caring harmony is telling the tale of what I mean.The production has blended heavy and sentimental every day drama with near and authentic emotion together with a high sensitivity and social description; the explained is on edge and almost done to perfection.After less than half the movie, I thought that maybe it could be the daughter reincarnated/continued into an extra terrestrial that came to Louise in Costello. I was wrong... or...wait....was I?Halfway through Arrival, one thing came to my mind frequently. If this movie has the authentic and serious way of wanting to convey the both excitement, entertainment and the continuing on the path of making the film near to grasp, the picture should have a solid ending.The way Arrival contemplates the special ""sixth sense and wonderful talents/gifts"" of human beings is remarkable and astonishing! What is out there for us to learn? Is life so much more than our body here and now?Denis Villeneuve, Eric Heisserer and Ted Chiang has taken a different and innovative turn of events in telling this unique (and at the same time ""good old genre"") story. Done with a sense of realism, drama and a vast tension that is all over the screen, through the audio field and in the experience. Entertaining to a high degree. Some great dialogue throughout Arrival: Louise Banks: How about if we just talk to them before we start throwing math problems at them?Ian Donnelly: It is a good story. Louise Banks: Thanks! It is not true, but it proves my point.Louise Banks: What should we call them? Ian Donnelly: How about Abbott and Costello?About the dialogue, I really want to give a little pun for the story, for you all to discover; Sheena Easton, is the arrival of your future past for your eyes only?I immediately was hooked by Arrival, both for the product itself and also (as written about before in my reviews) because the story and meaning itself went straight to my heart and mind.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Audio; those dark and bass oriented sounds that almost could be as vast alarms and growling sirens brings another huge dimension to the movie; very good done and great collected! The audio is very close and done with more than excellent precision; close your eyes and listen to all the little sounds and effects about 27 minutes into Arrival; amazing! Visual: top notch. All those colours! Look at the innocent and clear white and orange as the team is leaving and entering the ""ship"". A feast for your eyes (or is it pun intended; ""A feast for sore eyes... for your eyes only?"")! The environments inside the ""aircraft"" is fresh, simple and very tasteful... almost artistic. Strong, authentic and straight forward and honest dialogue. - The actors : Golden Globe nominations. Further questions? - Entertainment : Wow. That is a word I said out loud as the team entered the vessel; the artificial ""flash light"" is thrown up and lands on the wall as it is the floor. Then there is weightlessness and hefty breathing... what is happening? Recommendation? Yes. Why and how? Clear your senses and be opened minded. Arrival has arrived and with the arrival arrives a different kind of twist on the whole ""they're here"" topic. This is well done. This is a film for those who appreciate extra terrestrial movies, and with that a slow paced and thoughtful one. Otherwise; look for something else. - Age : 118,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 9 Brilliant and admirable 8 Excellent movie and a solid production)"
" Existential sci-fi film about humanity and time
",0.0,0.9652,2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"This is one of those films that I have a lot of appreciation for but probably wouldn't watch again. It's a artistic, existential and symbolic film that doesn't try to go in a pretentious direction. Instead most of the cryptic messages and symbols can be understood after some deep thinking. This isn't a sci-fi action movie or a sci-fi film with a lot of tension and thrills. Instead it's a very quite and slow paced sci-fi film that focuses in on humanity, universal language and the concept of time. So yeah I have respect for the director Denis Villeneuve to make a symbolic and artistic film that doesn't get pretentious or overly ambiguous. Overall, this is a impactful film that will keep the audiences thinking about existence, time and the importance of love and relationships because it's fleeting.8/10"
" This film divides the audience more than most
",0.0,0.9457,2017-01-20 00:00:00,2,"You will notice the reviews here are very divided - either you like it because it is so 'amazing' or you hate it because it is *not* a sci-fi movie as it was made out to be (as seen in the synopsis of IMDb). The so-called 'surprising end' that was mentioned by many reviewers was a downer to me. The ending twist (without giving away too much here) was essentially a personal dilemma regarding having a child or not. As you may expect - I was going for a sci-fi, looking for aliens and was confronted in the end with an apparently 'confusing tale'. I was totally disappointed. I really think that the synopsis from the film maker (and IMDb) should be more honest. They should sell the film as an personal drama with an ethical bend (because this is what it is). The so-called sci-fi elements in the film were completely incidental (and was 'light-weight' for sci-fi fans). The story could have easily been replaced by a woman touching an electrical cable and completely 'rewired' her visions about herself and her future (instead of trying to speak to the aliens, and then being re-wired by the contact). If you saw the film and came away thinking ... ""What was that?"", then I would advise you read this article - use Google search for 'How the short story that inspired Arrival helps us interpret the film's major twist' by the Verge. The give-away of the whole film why it is *not* a sci-fi movie was the reply that Amy Adams gave to her daughter - ""I made a mistake."" If you are a sci-fi fan, save your money. Go somewhere else. If you are just looking for a twist, perhaps this film will do it."
" For those who don't understand the movie
",0.0,0.9906,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"I've read some negative reviews below and they just don't understand. They're criticizing the way Amy Adams tries to communicate and how our government reacted etc and the movie's point is that the aliens did that on purpose to unite the humanity. That obviously is necessary for humanity to help them in 3,000 years.The plot is something scientific community was theorizing for many years and people who are not familiar with the concept may have issues comprehending it. I suggest watching it again. This is actually becoming popular movie plot as movies like Interstellar, About Time, and few others dabbled on but Arrival is the best adaptation of it.One complaint I have about most science fiction movies that feature aliens is that they always assume the aliens have similar intelligence as ourselves. All aliens are just more advanced version of humans. Just look at our own planet, we have thousands of levels of intelligence from a chicken to a dolphin to a monkey to humans. One thing people need to understand is that suppose we someday venture into space and find an alien race with a dog's intelligence. That would be marvelous discovery but that alien race will not understand our behaviors or motives. So if an advance alien race who can travel space and time visits us, what makes you think you can understand their motives? The directing and acting were superb. I'm glad they didn't turn it into an action flick as this movie will be remembered for a long time."

The best movies are based on books and Arrival is no exception. By attacking basic thought processes about communication, language, and dealing with the unknown, Arrival forces the viewer to visit some of the things we do that are so basic that we've forgotten the details about how they work and how flawed they can be. This is a thinker's movie; one I'll have to watch several times to fully wrap my brain around the details.While some of the world's responses to the visitors seems a bit over the top, it isn't detrimental since it serves to keep an otherwise deep story line moving along."
" Clichéd and Neurotic waste of a good premise
",-0.3182,-0.9592,2017-01-20 00:00:00,3,"Arrival is a film with a great premise, aliens arrive at Earth but how do we communicate with someone entirely different, not only in language, but in the way they are in the world? For this reason, a linguist is brought in and we follow along while she attempts to communicate.All of this is entertaining and thought provoking.Then the second half of the film happens and it turns to tripe and neurotic mess in no time.The film loses sight completely and turns into a garbled mess of clichéd ""one world"" signaling, supernatural ""chosen one foresight"", attempts at emotional allegory through confusion and flashbacks/foresight add to the feeling of neuroticism and solipsism.The protagonist goes from interesting character to narcissist neurotical and along with it the film loses its plot entirely. In fact there is no plot in the second half of the film, just an exercise in melancholia nonsense.Overall a bad film which suffers from ""too clever for my own good"" syndrome, you wish some studio exec with his mind on the money would have told the director to drop the signaling and focus on story and character development.It is a great surprise as to how this film has been receiving such a high rating. I attribute it to the same phenomenon which made people rave about Inception, the fear of appearing dumb, if you don't understand that which can't be understood, or The Emperor's New Clothes.Waste of time and particularly waste of time for Sci-Fi fans."
" Sad reminder of the lack of true classics in this generation
",-0.3818,-0.9563,2017-01-20 00:00:00,2,"What's good about this movie: The strongest point of this movie is the well-developed emotional arch for the female lead, which makes a rather nonsensical plot line somewhat relatable at least on the emotional level. Now on to the bad: The idea of friendly and benevolent alien face off with idiotic, paranoid and violent human is nothing new. Also, as some may have already mentioned, many of the plot details are laughable at best and rather insultingly nonsensical at worst. Crossing of barrier of space-time continuum, traveling billions light years to earth, an alien technology so advanced that they can defy the law of gravity and suspend aircrafts the size of a big island in midair, yet somehow, all the greatest minds and biggest decision makers on earth believe that such advanced being can be deterred by bullets, bombs and explosives. More unbelievably, even with the tightest security control, some idiotic crew members somehow managed to sneak in a c4 explosive and hopefully blow the aliens away with a single C4. Near the end, soldiers can just ride up in 4x4s like whole bunch of cow boys and spray bullets at the alien air crafts while the Colonel sit in the room like a dumb ass without any control over the situation. The whole movie is a smear campaign of China and Russia. It just feeds right into American's fear of the rising Chinese power. Somehow Chinese are scarier than the aliens, even though they are just fellow human beings. Communicating with Chinese or Russian somehow proved to be more difficult than communicating with aliens. What a load of bullock. Yeah, China is going to destroy earth, but alien saves the day. The fear and alienation of Chinese presented in this movie borderline racism. But don't worry, one single phone call to the Chinese General and some whisper of his wife's dying words will change everything and finally we accomplished the ever elusive world peace! Hurray! Except the two main leads: The scientist guy and the linguistics girl, every single human character in this movie come off like stupid arrogant ass and a disaster waiting to happen. Nobody seems to possess a single ounce of sense. And why bring a bird into the aircraft? If you want to test the air, shouldn't you let the bird in ""before"" human?"
" 9/10
",0.0,0.9965,2017-01-20 00:00:00,9,"Professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is one of the most brilliant linguists in the world. When aliens start appearing on the Earth in twelve random places she is tasked by the US Government to enter start communicating with them and eventually interpret their language. ""Arrival"" is one of the best motion pictures of recent times and continues to strike on the trend of very good and scientifically inspired sci-fi films we have had in recent times from ""Gravity"" to ""Interstellar"" and ""The Martian"". This films adds to that very good pantheon of modern Sci-Fi and it just might be one of the best we've had yet. Director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Bradford Young have been quoted saying that the look and feel they wanted to achieve for this film was a ""dirty Sci-Fi"", I think the end result is a triumph for what they set out to do, this film has a unique aesthetic to it, a brilliant one, the choices of editing and photography are incredibly coherent to the structure of the story, there is a whole visual language that is carefully crafted around the emotional and story beats of the film, it carries the audience through the picture and guides emotion masterfully and the best part is that is doesn't call attention to itself. The array of perfect choices that Villeneuve made here is more and more stunning the more I think of it. The visual grammar he establishes is pure genius, the choice to shoot almost always on the ground, the eye level shot looking up to introduce set-pieces, the use of shallow focus to reflect a key element of the plot, there is a slew of stylistic choices that are carried out with pitch perfect execution by Young and combine in making an almost flawless visual piece that is as beautiful as it is emotionally charged. There is a key distinction from the start to let the audience follow and experience only one clear point of view and that makes for another incredible decision that supports the story and the character development magnificently. After ""Prisoners"" and ""Sicario"" and now this we might just be experiencing the dawn of a new 'master of suspense'. That is how I would define Villenueve at the moment, his pictures are a masterclass in the building of tension and ""Arrival"" is the best example of that yet. Right from the beginning I always felt a sense of urgency to the story. With small touches and attention to details in every shot, he manages to build and build anxiety on the viewer, there is always this overlying sense of danger that manages to be established early on and never leave. Once again this all just a complex puzzle of stylistic choices in editing and photography that manages to pay off to incredible results. Every choice seems to be the right one, every shot has an aim to say something. Yet, the suspense is supported by fantastic art direction, production design. From the military base camp which has a clear structure and organization to the Alien ships, everything has been thought out extensively and presented to the audience clearly. Moreover, the weight that is conveyed to the aliens and the ships is vital to the success of the film. They feel alive and present, there was never a false beat with them and their presence loomed all over the film. Sound Design and music too are brilliant, both technically faultless and artistically inspired, bringing to life the emotion of the film just as beautifully as the rest of the departments. The film is also incredibly smart too, it trusts the audience and manages to open up a conversation that is as complex and multifaceted as it is fascinating and absorbing. This film stays with you, it is one of those pictures that affected me physically in the theater and after it. That is probably due to how much emotion and theme are vitally interconnected to plot and content. Every element the film needs for it to work is set-up early on, the audience is constantly entrusted with information and the film climaxes in a resolution that is as unpredictable as it is beautiful and moving and it never screams at you what is going on, thanks to a brilliant set-up you manage to think about what happens, slowly absorb it as the film is playing. Amy Adams has probably had one of the best series of performances an actress could have ever asked for. After ""Nocturnal Animals"" she gives us another portrait of character that is bewildering. Her work is constantly challenging and without spoiling everything she handles the differences in her character with a cunning ability. Jeremy Renner here probably deserves the most overlook performance of the year award, he is on the same level of Adams here and plays his quirky, sympathetic character with genuine depth and gives the audience a secondary lead instead of just a throw away supporting character he might have been. I think that there are a couple of faults the film has, but honestly I am still uncertain about them and have (and desperately want) to see the film a second time to see if some details passed over me. ""Arrival"" is a engrossing experience of emotion, spectacle and intelligence, a deeply moving picture that has me still thinking and one of which's images and concepts won't leave my head anytime soon."
" slow and boring
",-0.3182,-0.168,2017-01-19 00:00:00,3,"Went to see Arrival and could not wait to arrive at my home. The first hour is all chopped up, maybe filmed that way or just bad editing. Jeremy Renner was not bad for the little lines he had, Amy Adams who had the leading roll was very flaky and maybe belongs on TV than silver screen. This is a first Contact movie and there are many better ""First Contact"" Alien movies. The scrip was a very recycled one at best. My question is, who decided this was the Sci-Fi movie to dump millions into? Out of all the Sci-fi scrip this was the one; did that person even like Sci-fi? Chopped apart and boring. Maybe Hollywood should look at the Crowd funded movie Iron-Sky; that was a fun cult movie done for just a few Million, out of 10 I rated that movie 7.5 Arrival I rated just a 3--chopped apart and boring.

" Interesting, but too reminiscent of other recent sci-fi's
",0.2144,0.9985,2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"""Arrival"" begins as countless sci-fi stories begin: a few alien space-ships land (or, in this case ""float"") on Earth and people freak out to understand their intentions. In ""Indipendence Day"" their intentions were bad; in ""District 9"" the aliens become the victims. Here a simple story as this one evolves into something I could call Nietzschean, not to spoil with specifics to future viewers, growing into something I was not prepared for at the beginning. But at the same time this clever story shows some inevitable similarities to other hit sci-fi's of the past few years, first of all ""Interstellar"" by Christopher Nolan. While the first 3/4s of the film work magnificently, the ending feels more like a b-movie finale, with its race against time and predictable solution, although the final speech may bring less philosophically learned audiences food for the mind. It is not clear what the final encounter with the aliens means, though, and I fear that the scene was written that way to justify a sequel in a few years, but maybe it's just me.Denis Villeneuve's ""Sicario"" was a 2015 hit movie first of all because of its brilliant visual style. ""Arrival"" is no less so, with more beautiful landscapes and ingenious shots, especially inside the aliens' den. Johann Johannsson is also back for the score, which is true to his minimal style and really manages to enhance the power of some of the best scenes in the central part of the film; I actually didn't really like the use of the very well-known ""On the Nature of Daylight"" at the beginning and end of the movie though, as it feels like a cheap move to trigger an emotional response on the audience with such easy means. The simple design of the aliens and their space-ships is a true winner, being simultaneously mysterious, ominous and intriguing; the language used by the creatures is the greatest value of the whole movie, a true stroke of genius both in its design and in its broader meaning.It seems like Amy Adams's star has no intention to burn out, as we saw the actress star in two well-praised 2016 movies: ""Arrival"" and ""Nocturnal Animals"" by Tom Ford. While I personally don't like her too much, I must admit she's a true force of nature when it comes to explore emotional acting: in both films her characters undergo intense moments and she acts them out surehandedly and with a magnetic touch, helped by the two visual-heavy directors, who love to linger a lot on her face. Renner's Ian Donnelly is a funny guy, a lot similar in his behavior to the more famous role of his, Hawkeye. As a whole he doesn't do too much, but may be better this way. Whitaker is a great actor and, although his role is not the biggest ever, he stands well between the other mains."

This is not just another ""first encounter"" alien sci-fi flick. The story is beautifully layered and works with making the viewer feel rather than flat out throw something in your face to make a point. Do not expect and just take it at face value. I absolutely loved it and would watch it again. People who dislike it probably wanted more action, but I think it is so refreshing for such a ""big"" subject to be delivered so gently. In truth nobody knows how an alien introduction would go because we humans live in our own world with our own logic and this movie makes that point perfectly. So the critical remarks on how believable the plot is really make no sense to me. I'd say this was pure perfection 10/10."

There just wasn't much to the film in both location filming and special effects.It seems to me the production company may have been trying to do a number on the IRS come tax time. There were only five basic locations: Amy Adam's home in the film, the college where she teaches, the army base, the field where the alien spacecraft was and a very nondescript spaceship interior.As for the film...in other times it would be a B sci-fi movie. But these days, the millennials are making into a mind bending sci-fi masterpiece, which it isn't.We are supposed to buy that technically advanced giant squid-like creatures not only build huge spacecraft and travel all over the galaxy, but they can foretell the future as well. And apparently one of their visions told them to come to the Earth...more specifically 12 of them come to Earth, hovering peacefully over various nations.Yet, with this on their minds, if they have any, and all their evolutionary and inter galactic knowledge they don't have a simple tourist English phrase book among them...they can't communicate with anyone. That is until Adams comes along. She's a linguist recruited by the army to translate a single grunt sound that came from the aliens. Good luck on that.The aliens hold an open house for the earthlings hoping that someone will talk to them. Adams rises into the ship and meets the space aliens who appear behind a glass barrier (we assume their atmosphere is different from earth's). The outer space cephalopods seem to be dancing around similar as marionettes would do...except no strings are visible. It's really out of the campy 1950s movie scene.Nothing much is explained in the film which leaves the audience to figure out how Adams finally communicates with the visitors. At the end you are left with questions and no definite answers."
" One of the worst movies I've seen
",-0.6249,0.8648,2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,"There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said in the myriad of other 1 and 2 star reviews. This movie is quite simply a complete and total waste of 2 hours. I'm an avid moviegoer, and I particularly like movies that exercise your brain as well as entertain, but this completely uninteresting, boring movie just puts you to sleep. I'd liken it to an extremely pretentious, ridiculously overpriced piece of abstract art in a gallery, to which everyone ascribes their own motivations to the artist, but in actuality was just a bunch of cockroaches walking through spilled paint and on to a canvas that was laying on the floor. If you want to watch a couple semi-visible squid-like finger puppets stand in fog for 2 hours while painting circular ink blots in the air, then ignore what I've said, this is the movie for you.Now as to the absurd IMDb rating, I'm convinced that IMDb ratings have recently started being greatly inflated by some overseas company that's paid by the studios to submit very high IMDb ratings through bogus accounts, much like those companies that advertise on TV that they'll create your company's Facebook page for you, then fill it with positive reviews. Obviously that's completely dishonest, but for the moment it's legal. I reached this conclusion after recently watching another highly overrated steaming pile of feces (Nocturnal Animals), ironically also starring Amy Adams, who I happen to like. In both cases, the average rating of people who wrote out a review was substantially lower and much more realistic than the IMDb rating. With Nocturnal Animals I was so shocked that the rating could be so high while noticing so many horrible reviews, that I went through all of the reviews (there were 163 at the time) and calculated the average rating. It was a very mediocre 6.3, which is a number you'd associate with a so-so movie that you may or may not like, whereas the IMDb rating for it was (at the time) 7.8, a number you'd associate with a very good movie that most people would enjoy watching. I haven't taken the time to calculate the average reviewer's rating for Arrival, it's simply not worth wasting even more of my life, but again, having looked through 3 or 4 pages of the most recent reviews, it's painfully obvious that the average reviewer's rating is WELL below the absolutely ridiculous IMDb rating of 8.3, and probably in the neighborhood of 5.5 to 6.5, much like Nocturnal Animals."
" Well made, but...
",0.2732,0.8556,2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"Arrival is centered around a very interesting concept. How would you communicate with an alien species? How can a scientist approach this contact effort when faced with the impatience and the dictation of topics by the politicians and the general public? The film deals with the issue patiently and semi-scientifically, albeit in rather naive fashion (Amy Adams is the second linguist working on the project, and no one so far had thought of trying drawing/writing? Com' on). The side story with the daughter looks like the most overused cliché in cinema (you can guess ""dead kid trauma"" from the first scene) but turns out to have a bit of a twist which makes it clever. The aliens themselves are interestingly Cthulhoid (just in appearance!), the other countries' attitude towards the aliens does not really drift towards wrong- cause- they're-not-Muricans territory, and all in all the film has no major weaknesses - except for the main plot resolution, which is that the aliens' gift is their language. Which could be a good idea, if understanding their language didn't provide a way to...see the future. Yep. Apparently with amazing accuracy over incredible time periods. How is this a thing? I don't know. But science fiction films which try to focus on matters that regard actual science and more or less realistic issues should probably avoid this sort of interstellar-y mumbo jumbo."
" Boring and very dull
",-0.6478,-0.9723,2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,"Cannot understand how this can get rated so high. I really looked forward to this film as it looked different from the mainstream.For a film to be a science fiction film it should contain some element of science. This had virtually none.The first 10 minutes of the film set the tone for the rest of it. It was so depressing dull an confusing I thought I was watching the wrong film.Then they just pop into existence.And everyone panics and starts robbing stores etc etc.Then the American military step in to persuade a translator into service. Yeah this is a very realistic, apparently they have none of their own.The method of attempting communication was not very scientific.Me human you are ? on a wipe board..... Give me a break. Then it gets even worse. Apparenty they military cannot even position the lift directly under a great big hole. They have to lift them up then move to whole lift to where the entrance is. Why not just put it underneath?Why do they keep ferrying equipment back and to ? They must have cameras etc and power supplies that can last more than a few days.The protection against contamination was not realistic. They had to move up to a kilometer in contaminated suits to get back to decontamination. Err I think that would have been a bit too late. Also why a second mask inside a hazmat suit ? What military don't have suits with built in communication.!!!As the film progressed it degenerated into the GOOD west and the BAD East. It then got even worse because security was SO poor some solders managed to back a few pound of C4 on board.Yes we all understand that Americans are stupid but really 10 pounds of C4 vs a ship that has a probable mass of a million tons. Like trying to damage Empire State with a matchstick.Then the peak of the film where it explains everything is in a 30 second clip. Miss this and you will be lost, don't even blink.This film had a lot a promise but unfortunately it turned out to be a dud.2 hours of my life wasted."

He's been scored on films by Scorsesse, French auteur Anne Fontaine Les Innocentes, Stranger than Fiction, in Disconnect, and of course in Arrival.As another friendly reviewer, this times on Amazon, aptly writes: ""if you are prone to melancholia it will definitely ping at your emotions"".Photography and music work together to make it a haunting masterpiece. It does have some funny moments, emotions are there, specially in the end, there is a lot to think and mull over afterwards.

It didn't. The ending was vague, confusing and by the time it came, I was thinking of other things.If you are expecting a superior plot, this is not for you. if you expecting exciting special effects, this is not for you.

It isn't even in the same league as the very average Contact. Which at least on first watching holds your interest, but doesn't stand up to repeated viewing.The science aspects in the film are laughable. I have no idea why it has such high praise or has such a high IMDb rating. Amy Adams is quite good. I don't think I have seen her in a ""bad movie"" up until this. Not that the movie is terrible, it isn't (well not most of it anyway). The special effects (other than alien design) were acceptable, but that isn't my gripe.The movie is full of clichés. Such as angry generals who want to blow everything up and only one person can stop them. Well actually that's basically the entire main plot. The aliens are laughable. I've seen more convincing ones in 1950 B movies. Seriously they're just large Octopi.The entire movies message is that if peaceful aliens arrive on Earth we should be ""nice"" to them. This is where the overdone angry army officials come in. You would think, in real life, many of these generals would've already seen this type of film and wouldn't be so eager to blow everything up. I mean lets be honest, if aliens have the technology to travel across vast regions of space, manipulate gravity and even time. It's safe to assume they probably have the capabilities to withstand any primitive attack of the type humans currently have the ability to throw at them. For me this is where the entire movie falls down. It's comparable to the supposedly all powerful alien football in ID2, which isn't capable of stopping the nasty aliens from wiping out it's entire species..... It makes no sense and overall ruins the movie.I don't even want to get into the ridiculousness of the stuff about language and how difficult it is for the humans and aliens to communicate. If the aliens can see through time, isn't it safe to assume they would have learned human language before even setting off on their mammoth trek through/across space/dimensions? ""I know lets just turn up on another planet and see what happens?"". Were they drunk or summin? If they were that would at least make some sense but then after sobering up why still hang around for a few more months? The science, as mentioned, also makes no sense. Nor do the decisions the aliens make. Apparently the aliens written and vocal language do not correlate. Well this then raises the question of how they managed to build ships that can presumably cross dimensions. You cannot communicate rapidly or in-depth by sign language alone! How the hell do they communicate mathematics? I kinda feel that other reviewers of this movie have completely let me down. Which makes me even more disappointed at how ""average"" the movie actually is. I was expecting more."

When I left the cinema I couldn't help but feel like someone had just conned me.The basis of this film is great. An alien species arrive on earth and the various governments deal with it their own way. A linguist and a physician get called out to the landing area of one of the spaceships and are asked to communicate with the aliens. Up to this point I was on the edge of my seat.Then the director decides its time to throw it all away. He gives some really poor explanation on how the aliens communicate, and the protagonist through a series of moments of heavy breathing (literally) and flashbacks somehow understands it all.There is no science fiction in this, not one bit. It is pure fantasy and honestly a waste of talent and potential. Throughout almost the whole film it felt like the ball was on the goal line, and you are waiting there for someone to just tap it in.

" Great visuals but the story is punching above its weight
",0.3716,0.9666,2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"Arrival – NO SPOILERS I watched this last night and has taken me a while to makes sense of my thoughts on it. I have steered away from other reviews for fear of spoilers etc so this is a completely objective and personal review of which I'm sure will have a much divided backlash. OK, so lets start with the good : The film itself as a visual product is stunning, no doubt about it, when you have 2 hours set effectively set between a military camp and a huge floating pebble, the visual hook has got to be there, and it was! These visuals compliment the cast, well.Amy Adams perfectly! She really flexed her acting muscles here imo and proved herself an incredibly competent actress and thought she was brilliantly cast for the role and may be the best performance I've seen from her. Her character embodies so many emotions throughout the film and Adams really brings this to life, you believe what shes feeling...grief,excitement,confusion etc. I do however feel the rest of the 'known' actors were sort of thrown in just to rack up a celebrity endorsement. Unfortunately, aside from the great visuals and Amy Adams performance there really wasn't anything else holding this film together. I understood the messages the film was trying to get out there, but when the film finished I found myself not pondering the message the film tried to convey , but ratherwhat was the point in making such a visually impressive film wrapped around such a weak plot/screenplay. The music score I found very odd, in that I like music to dictate the pace of the film and emphasize the tone and emotion of scenes, but with Arrival, it was all just very low and dull which really didn't seem to do anything in terms of highlighting the mood of certain scenes and actually making 'breakthroughs' and pivotal moments seem to come out of leftfield with no sense of tension of build-up. The aliens – I just found them very underwhelming ,and not sure how these giant floating squid like things could build those ships., so assume they just have an unfathomable level of intelligence and technology.which then makes me question how they don't have a way/device of translating with humans? I admire the plot being its own thing and quite unique but imo it was punching way above its weight and as such left me frustrated with the plot holes and issues I had with the consistency of the unfolding story , but that would mean going into spoiler territory and I wont do that!I With that said, there's not really anything else to comment on To sum up, this film is what I would expect if Shyamalan was to tackle a 'Sci Fi' film, and I found It delivered far less than what the first 15mins or so promised. This was a 2 hour journey explaining in a very complicated way the reason behind the alien's arrival and also to show how humanity reacts to something that isn't understood. I will give this a 6/10 , and it's the cinematography and Amy Adams performance that's got it up there."
" Stunning but with a huge screech
",0.5789,0.5151,2017-01-18 00:00:00,5,"Let me say up front that for the reason I will lay out in time I would have given this film a flat out 10 stars without hesitation. It's with a heavy heart that I halve that score in grief for what else this film could have been.That said this film will remain a modern classic, up there with the likes of The Matrix, Inception, Contact, ex machia... any of that ilk. It has everything in stunning filming, thought provoking ideas and philosophies. It asks questions without being rude enough to answer them for you.You'll want to see it again... Despite my misgivings I will want to see it again.So when flying saucers land in several major cities on Earth the audience is drawn into the immediate concern about how the various nations will respond... Nothing wrong with that until...Until Hollywood decides that the good old US of burgermunching A is not only going to be the most peaceful, the most rational nation in this regard. Not to mention the only nation on the globe that has a single clue what to do next and how to work it all out.Whereas the other nations, especially china and Russia decide to go all psycho and declare star wars.Some historical context in case you're reading this in 2018... Obama has just left office and obviously Trump hasn't got us all killed yet.At the time of it's release no nation on earth was doing more to promote bloodshed, violence, anger and malice than the USA not to mention a complete lack of tact, imagination and communication skills... China and Russia on the other hand...The message that ""It's OK, the USA has this, the Earth is safe"" was layered like thick strawberry jam over every single frame of this erstwhile Sci-Fi masterpiece. All it needed was a marching band and pom poms.I'm not stupid, I am well aware that nations and even military's have their say in global movie making but can't they keep that sort of nonsense for Stalone & Schwarzenegger movies?So my message to Hollywood for this is simple...How dare you?

It's the classic trope where extra-terrestrials land publicly and first contact is made. You brace yourself for a disaster since army men put themselves in charge as usual (a major reason why, in real life, aliens avoid Earth like the measles.) And where many writers failed to conclude their own take in a fulfilling manner, Arrival delivers the goods with a clever, emotional, yet simple narrative that explains all what we saw and still leaves a lot to our imagination.The film thus owes most to its story. It does complement it with great visuals, and decent acting. On the other hand, it does suffer from being unnecessarily slow. Your patience will be tested at times, and is required for you to enjoy your candy at the end. As I said, it makes me want to read the source material much more than it calls for a future rewatch."

This is not a movie you watch once and completely understand. But it is entertaining. Twelve alien spacecrafts arrive on Earth and experts are called in to make contact. The two experts on which the story focuses are interesting. Their path to understanding the aliens keeps you watching while at the same time you cant help feeling some parts are missing.

But to be honest every Agathe Christie movie has me more captivated in solving the puzzle (of the crime) or watching an Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot in doing so as our heroes in Arrival trying to decipher the messages of the aliens. Arrival is sci-fi of the kind that is more about a political correct agenda (don't fear the alien, this ingredient they took from District 9) as real sci-fi or even entertainment - I would prefer almost every sci-fi B-movie from the 50s with laser guns and stuff to this one who tries to be something like 2001 but fails heavy like Interstellar. To put it simply - the writers of Arrival are not in the league of Phillip K. Dick or Isaac Asimov and the like. This is ""sci-fi"" for the political correct audience (almost no violence and in the end all humans wonderously get into some human-world-brotherhood, as if all the conflicts and crimes just would disappear because of some aliens arrival) and like p.c it is: mostly boring. On top some of the talk about the difficulties to talk to aliens is almost zero science or at least only on a very basic level which everyone with some brains could tell you without studying anything. Alone the assumption of our heroes, that the aliens don't expect that the first of all questions of the humans to them will be something like ""what do you want or what do you intend to do?"" is so dumb - I mean those guys know humans have had no contact to other ""outsiders"" before and they travel the space so they are not dumb like apes - they will approach humans like apes and will know what kind of confusion etc. they had produced with their landings. And the regular cliché that the U.S. military or CIA or whatever organization of the government has no own specialists regarding communication with foreign cultures etc. is super-dumb. Another p.c. stuff: almost every movie nowadays has a woman as hero to save the world or to boss around etc. pp., I just wait for the first African-American transgender woman to save or conquer the world or Ethan Hunt returns after an operation as a woman ;) But the worst is that the makers of Arrival have imo forgotten the main reason why you make movies: entertainment. And no, I don't need action to be entertained, I watched Polanskis Carnage and I was Extremely entertained without one explosion or shot done. All the real classics and masterpieces of sci-fi like 1984, Dark Star, Logans Run, Soylent Green and the many others raise big questions in science and philosophy etc. but they also ENTERTAIN great. Arrival is everything but big in entertaining - e.g. Oblivion with Cruise is a masterpiece compared to Arrival. This I say with a heavy heart because I especially like Amy Adams as an actress (this is one positive aspect of the movie, her performance ofc is good). What else left to say!? I just hope that in the next movie of Ridleys Alien-saga the aliens and humans don't have something like cuddly or encounter groups to solve their ""communication"" problems :DNote: If I would be a producer or writer I would make a persiflage-movie about the p.c.-movment with a hero like an African-American homosexual transgender of Jewish origin who is mentally challenged and sits in a wheelchair but is the best and most lethal special commando of the USA (with Trump as President) - the story would be executed in the tradition of Naked Gun with a good shot of Rambo brutality."
" Loopholes aside this is an astonishing personal drama... with aliens
",0.0,0.9902,2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"""Arrival"" is the kind of movie I wanted to watch with as little information as possible. The trailer intrigued me and roused my interest: a story of aliens finally making first contact, and our inability to understand them. How that could sustain itself for a 2-hour run time was beyond me, but this (I'm thrilled to say) is a movie full of beauty that just about left me spellbound.Our heroine is Louise (Amy Adams in what has got to be one of her best roles), a linguist who teaches at a college and lives alone in a glass house overlooking a lake. We learn about her daughter, a smart young girl who died of cancer at a young age. It's a heartbreaking opening to the film, a set up to a story that has more emotion than the sci- fi genre would have you believe. Suddenly, large orbs appear all over the world. It makes the news and interrupts the class with a barrage of phone calls and texts. No one can verify them as man-made, and the locations around the planet seem strategic. This is indeed first contact. People are glued to the TV and buildings are evacuated. I wonder what would happen if aliens ever were to touch down on earth. I would assume this is as accurate as I would imagine.Louise is contacted almost immediately by a Colonel (Forest Whitaker), who confirms contact has been made with the alien beings, and yet no promising communication can be made. He asks her to decipher an audio clip that sounds as much like a language as a whale's call. It's impossible. Louise confirms that the only way to actually learn would be to have a face-to-face encounter; to teach them the rudimentary words and go from there... You start with the word for ""human"" and end with the answer to the complex question ""what are your intentions here on earth?""The spaceship is one of the many striking aspects of the film, first revealed in a grand shot in the wilderness of Montana. Fog spills over green hills, and there on the horizon is a black mass 1,000 feet in the air, hovering just above the ground. A military base is set up nearby, and work is quickly underway. The entrance to the ship is a 10-foot hole that opens at the base every 18 hours. A cherry picker raises the crew inside the chasm, and a change in gravity allows them to literally walk up the walls to a meeting chamber. I wonder how they first made this discovery, or who was the first to agree to venture inside the menacing ship.There is a twist of sorts at the climax of the film that leaves you reeling over the images and moments leading up to it. It still has me scratching my head by the complexity of it, and left me somber at it's implications. This is a deus ex machina to end all deus ex machinas, and yet I was moved by the way it worked out (rather than feeling cheated). The climax ends in a way that could only happen through specific series of events, and if you think too hard about what is happening you will only hurt yourself. How badly I want to ask you questions about the movie, the ending, the aliens (10-foot tall beings that look like upright squid), and the expansive questions of fate and choice. This is a brilliant movie directed by Denis Villeneuve (he made one of the decade's best movies last year with 'Sicario') and the talent displayed is bar-none some of the best filmmaking around right now. The score by Jóhann Jóhannsson is surely an Oscar-contender for it's ease in slipping back and forth between sounds of horror and orchestral moments of harmony. For a film this complex, giving a concise review is hard. It's better to just advise you to see this movie as soon as possible, and perhaps plan ahead to see it twice."
" A true science fiction masterpiece

People who are looking for another ""Independence Day"" disaster movie, should just skip it altogether, since I can see that many negative reviews come from that type of audience. Don't get me wrong - I myself sometimes like to just be entertained - but this film demands that you ""boost your CPU"" a little bit.The people who think it was boring - clearly did not understand it, either on the intellectual or the emotional level. Yes, the story has several plot holes and several unrealistic moments (hence the vote 9/10), but those do not change the essence, nor the point of this film.The point of the film are not aliens per se, that is just the setting. It is a film about us and our decisions in life. About trying to perceive time and reality in a different way. We as a species are locked into a certain way of perceiving things, hence that is where our way of thinking comes from. It is a very difficult task to imagine and portray a different kind of logic and perception in a two hour movie, and I think that Denis Villeneuve does that very well.There are certain aspects of the movie that may have been done a little more convincing (such as the diplomatic part, military protocol, etc.), but that does not change the fact that if you follow the story carefully and think about it - you will get some wonderful ideas out of it.Anyone who likes true, smart stories - should definitely watch this in a cinema (or wait for the bluray)."

There is very little redeeming about this movie. The dialogue is forgettable. There are no special effects to speak of. The aliens look like finger puppets. Literally. And, if the big reveal at the end truly wows you, then ... you are probably too simple to have read this far in my review.Nothing to see here. Move along.Apparently, I need more lines of text to tell you that this is a boring, bleak movie. It took me more than one attempt to finish it, and I got absolutely nothing out of it.

I SWEAR if I didn't know it was aliens in that giant semi- gravity stone tube, I would have thought I am listening to some sort of whales hunt. Half an hour later you sit in front of the screen even more dazed and disoriented than before. The only new twist is the womb-like feeling Amy Adams finds herself in, her bouncing hair and that creepy white mist which seems to transport people and dissolve matter at the same time. By the end of the movie you begin to question every choice you have made in your life, including why you decided it was a good idea to see a movie where a semi-linguist, semi-fortune teller and a semi-scientist try to decipher a mysterious alien language, because 3,000 years later the alien whales will need some human help.

Whatever score you might grant this film it's worth seeing.

Most films of this genre always assume that Aliens will be able to understand us and we them.Spoiler Alert !!! My issue with the film is that the plot is just too weak and convenient. The question would be why would an advanced Alien race really care if the countries of the world get on or not, and why would they want to give us a gift? Ahhh OK lets just say that they will need our help 3000 years in the future so that's why they are ding us a favour now, so we will happily repay it one day. Also if they can travel around time and space with relative ease then why cant they sort out there own problem in 3000 years?To summarise, great idea and a promising start, still interesting after 20 mins, then it starts to get over complicated and in parts very boring. Acting good but some characters seem unnecessary and just tacked on to get the A-list count up.

" Marvellous movie
",0.0,0.9961,2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Arrival might be the best work by Denis Villenueve (Sicario, Incendies, Prisoners) and the smartest piece of sci-fi since Alfonso Cuaron's 2013 film Gravity. Based on a short story ""Story of My Life"" by Ted Chiang, the film's an introspective piece of work which'll not only get the viewers talking about it but will also get their emotions reeling. It's so unlike any sci-fi movie ever done before as it sheds the weight of war and thrill and focuses purely on inability to communicate properly with the extraterrestrial and one's perception.Unlike some of the previous works by Villenueve, Arrival reflects on the better side of humanity by interplaying the relationships between the two species. Yet it's still full of mystery and marvel as the intentions are truly left unclear until the end. The flashes of scenes is brilliantly edited in the present context of the movie, and makes the screenplay very emotive and reflective. It compounds views on what one's actions can lead to. The smartest decision by Villenueve might be the trade off between heavy reliance on special effects and focus on emotions and perception. This not only propels the message behind the screenplay, but the subtle effects also complements the ambiance.The cinematography is simply beautiful. And if the movie does not get an Academy award nomination (or a win) for it, I shall forever resent them. It's beautifully done and features references to classics like 2001: The Space Odyssey and the Day the Earth Stood Still. The score only aims to complement the movie more. The art direction is greatly done as well, as the empty vast space inside the supposed shuttle only goes on to elevate the mystery of the movie even more.But the true hero of the movie's not the brilliant screenplay nor the cinematography but it's Amy Adams. The movie quintessentially work on the basis of her performance. Adams sheds her usual demeanor for a very subdued performance here and it simply works wonder. Playing a linguist tasked with deciphering the ambiguous language from scratch while fighting her own fears. She's phenomenal here, her body language, her countenance, it only makes the movie more compelling than it already is. I would go so far as to exclaim it the best performance she has given since Doubt.The movie's not without its flaws though, running at a length of about 120 minutes the screenplay can get lax by the end. Whitaker, who's a wonderful actor is entirely wasted here as his character falls behind the scene for a big length of the time. Renner fails to contribute anything to the movie as well and could've been easily swapped out by anyone and it wouldn't matter.Anyway, the movie's an intellectual piece of work, which will not only work your emotions but also get you thinking, carried by a brilliant performance by Adams and marvelous technical work, Arrival's a must watch for not just sci-fi fans but any moviegoer. 9/10"
" Alieni ex machina
",0.0,0.9378,2017-01-16 00:00:00,1,"You can remove the aliens altogether and the story would be equally absurd, although it seems the direction prefers to employ them in order to bypass logic/common sense, especially regarding the concept of time. Time is just 'consequential change', and in measuring it we rely upon the regularity of a repeated process, as recorded in our memory. So how does learning a language factor in here? You neither perceive/experience phenomena/events nor foresee them through language, but through senses and intelligence. How would learning a spoken/written language boost your brain processing power to the scale of calculating an infinite multitude of future scenarios (basically chaos), or boost your memory so you can read all this info from a screenful of circles (so that you could then foresee what the dying wife of a Chinese general would tell him on her deathbed in one specific scenario)? Thus the movie results in a chain of suspensions of disbelief, fully removing the sci from sci-fi... Either that, or it's all happening inside the protagonist's head as a dream, hallucination or some type of seizure causing all the incoherence (judging from the coffee bean ships with fish-tank squids squirting semantics through coffee mug stains, it's probably happening in a coffee shop). Unfortunately the message trying to be conveyed is lost in pseudoscience - and the protagonist's choice doesn't follow the movie's logic either. If she can foresee the future, why not choose the best one out of the infinite possible scenarios of if-thens that are unlocked for her from alieni ex machina, surely there would be some better future in an infinity of if-thens than just the set-in-stone one she keeps hallucinating of.Alternate gist of it in sci-fi terms: Space-faring squids infect human patient zero with a brain virus which she proceeds to spread all over the planet in order to make humans ready for when they'll need our 'help' after the Earth has performed 3k helices around the Sun from the start of infection. The virus enters victims through an undisclosed procedure, as the movie starts with patient zero already experiencing the virus' effects (probably through some type of focused radiation at extraplanetary distance), and works by implanting directives as personal memories to the CNS and achieving the zombiefication of the victim who, due to a clever subroutine of the virus, now believes these directives to be his/her own choice (as he/she now 'remembers the future' from interpreting coffee mug stains which he/she believes to be language symbols of a space-faring species). The intricacies of this long processing of humans are probably stuff for a sequel and the stepping stone to their Arrival."
" A heartwarming and emotional Sci-Fi Drama
",0.5719,0.967,2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"Scripted by Eric Heisserer based on Story of Your Life, by short-fiction writer Ted Chiang, Arrival is more or less the anti-Independence Day.Arrival boldly snubs the standard alien- invasion vernacular of contemporary movies to explore a mood and language of its own. It may be a touch too subdued for the mainstream, but the movie has brains and originality. Adams gives her best performance as a lonely woman who has to make a decision that will haunt her – though perhaps in a good way – for the rest of her life. Although Arrival is about first contact with extraterrestrials, it says more about the human experience than the creatures from another world. This is a singularly powerful movie, without question one of 2016's best. I go with 4.5/ 5 for Denis Villenueve's another Directorial masterpiece."

""Should I make a sci-fi movie about aliens making contact, or should I make a movie about a woman that can see into the future? Hey, how about I combine the two, to mess with the audience lol?!""Seriously, each of these two components would have each made for a brilliant movie, but combining the two was just too convoluted, and in my opinion, a joke. How can all these other reviewers call this brilliant? It was a mind game of constant convolution with sub par action, all star cast with monotonic dialogue that bores the viewer. The entire cast was lacking in any adrenaline, and instead acted as if the coffee machine was down throughout the entire filming and they were struggling to act. Very monotonic and too slow paced. There is zero climax in this film to the point where I was borderline ready to fall asleep.Sure the visuals 'at times' where stunning, and the score was appropriate, but everything else flopped in my opinion. And the back and forth between the flashbacks/flashforwards was very tiring with 'way' too many plot holes. For example, if you know you will give birth to your daughter that will die (because you can see the future), and lose your husband over it (who happens to be a top scientist), don't have a child, and stay married, so these two genius can prepare the rest of mankind for the future 3000 year alien rendezvous that will occur. That seems much more 'brilliant' than any other aspect in this film, and had that been the case, then maybe it would in fact have been a brilliant film.

The idea is kind of like Independence Day, where ships appear over 12 points on earth and each ship has a team of experts dealing with it. The US team made up of Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, are the focus of the movie. I have no problem with the idea behind the movie, in fact, I came in hoping that it wouldn't be a rip-off of the idea (ships appearing over metropolitan areas is not a new concept in science fiction). Many movies (and authors) have different takes on this. Regardless, the interaction with the aliens is good. The way it's done is pretty good. But, there really is not build up, and no denouement, it's just flat, all the way through. There is a bit of something, but frankly, not enough to really interest me to see it again. I kept hoping, since this is a movie that, I'm assuming, they want to win some sort of award. Denis Villeneuve did Sicario, which was excellent. Loved that movie and a couple of his others. Amy Adams, I like. Jeremy Renner, Forrest Whittaker, Mark O'Brien (whom I've been a fan of since he was on Republic of Doyle), overall a great cast. But, like I said, the movie falls flat."

The story could be fun, the reviews looked fine.The first 2 minutes into the movie, you start already to get doubts it will be good. It's all so tiny, only a couple characters, no big multinational companies involved. No people running around with a purpose.Now once they get at the banana looking spaceship after a couple minutes. The producers run out of money already, You end up with a lady who has a paranormal mind, can suddenly talk with the aliens.The aliens prepared for millions of years to meet this hot lady to tell her sweet stories, and then leave.PS: When Amy and that other guy are in the field looking at the spaceship, you can see the mountains in the far distance. You would expect millions of people to come take a look, but they all prolly stayed at home to watch CNN get to brainwashed."
" this movie was dope!
",0.0,0.9462,2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"i've watched this 5 times already this weekend...really love the sag screeners!!! hoping this would have had a sequel set up but it was just as good though. i had to watch it again to try to understand what the hell just happened. if you liked how pulp fiction turned you upside down or how the matrix made you rethink reality - this does the same thing. the ads didn't lie, i went in skeptical but it really does make you rethink the entire movie & timeline. so that's why i've watched 5 times now. i think i've figured it out. i won't reveal it but if i'm saying its good enough to watch 5 times then it should be a great ride for the general public. acting is on point. i like how they have enough familiar faces that trail their own new characters."
" very weak sci-fi offering
",-0.4927,0.1273,2017-01-15 00:00:00,3,"When there's a consensus that something is really good, I can usually find the good in it. That is not the case with this clunker. I do not know what this movie is about. I mean, what it's ABOUT. Time? Well, it talks about time. It took up some of my precious time. I know they want me to think it's profound. But I just didn't see any THERE there. It's supposed to be about the arrival of aliens. I think this is also reaching towards being about memory. Yet it doesn't have anything important to say about that either. It does do one thing that I hate 99% of the time, and maybe this is what the movie is really about: flashbacks. Since this is the cheapest trick in TV - and even some movie franchises are built around them, maybe the idea here was just to make a movie about that and write a story about an alien landing around it. Nothing really happens in this barely moving movie anyway. What a clunker!"
" Obsession for Extra-terrestrials
",-0.34,0.9979,2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Short version, okay to wait for renting it, does not demand the big screen....and yes the film is not an action flick, but nice enough to see and then think/talk about it with friends/family. A fine Friday night before dinner film.... The less you know about it, probably the better.Longer review, mild spoilers included...My 8th grade boys and I enjoyed this (but the same week, they were buzzing more about the TV show ""People of Earth"" for what it's worth.) Having recently read a book by Steven Johnson arguing on behalf of the more intricate stories in TV shows as a sign of growing intelligence or something like that, it was interesting to see this film, heralded as a smart sci-fi film, but with such a slim story line.Of course the story line does get a bit curved or warped if you will, and there is a whiff of romance. But I almost felt like this could have been an excellent Twilight Zone (a moment of silence for the failed efforts to revive that classic show).I did find myself wondering about the 12 different locations (Sudan, Pakistan made the cut along with the US, the UK, Russia and China, so was North Korea left off the list...was it targeted at the top 10 war-torn, or war-friendly??). I also wondered if each arrival came with two 7-footers (not the NBA type).But the spare story-telling might have been intentional, the vague swirling images of our visitors....and the stellar, scene-stealing soundtrack all could help make less more. Surely the romance tried that inverse relationship, that definitely felt like a jig-saw puzzle missing a lot of pieces. Heck, even when the team visited with Abbott and Costello, they didn't use the whole time allotted? That part bugged me (but of course I also wondered if the aliens were initially communicating to the canary in the dilithium crystal mine).In hindsight, or is it foresight, could the linguistic relativity have also given Amy Adams' character other flash-forward-backward visions. Opened up new stories to tell. Or made for some 2001 homage montage.Anyways, the austere atmosphere for everything about the film worked okay, and I almost would like to see a mash-up of an old Obsession TV commercial with the alien interactions. Cloud chamber chic! Because of the more subtle nature of the film, if you didn't catch it on the big screen, I think that is fine (or if you want to save a couple of months worth of Netflix charges....) It was somewhat exciting to see the first shots approaching the alien ships, and the interaction (which you may have seen a little of in previews).Lastly, and perhaps most importantly I went looking just now for how quickly people could translate such a truly foreign language, and came across this article that I enjoyed, and you might as well.Hmmm, not allowing the link so it's at slate.com wit Betty Birner, a linguist, from 11/22/16.Actually she dismisses the ""linguistic relativity"" that I had heard about before, and also it has the name of the theory that I didn't quite catch in the film : Sapir-Whorf.Lastly I saw some comments in the chat area, and I do think that this T2 film argues for determinism, and that always gives me the free-willies."
" Beautiful movie with a heart
",0.5994,0.7809,2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,"The Arrival has no shooting and explosions, the soul of the movie is beyond that in my opinion. Rarely have I seen a movie that resonates so deeply with longings and wishes of my soul. I am a huge fan of science fiction, especially Star Trek. I prefer it to Star Wars because Star Trek is about the human condition. If you know what I am talking about, I am sure you are going to love The Arrival."
" A movie for language nerds, by language nerds. Non-nerds who think should enjoy, too.
",0.4939,-0.0544,2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"The movie opens with a university linguistics professor having some apparent dream sequences, followed by her arrival to teach an unusually thinly-attended History of Romance Languages class. We quickly learn that her language abilities range much wider, from South Asian languages to those of China (though there were snickers heard in the largely Cantonese-And-Mandarin- speaking audience I was with). What she gets pulled into is, of course, farther-ranging still.At the very start of the movie, it's strongly implied that the professor, Dr Louise Banks, has never been married, and conversation with the other lead character, Dr Ian Donnelly, self-deprecatingly furthers the impression. Yet a major theme of the movie is grief over loss; we see her daughter grow up and die from a rare disease as a young woman; the experience drives Dr Banks and her husband apart. The grief is searingly portrayed; it is impossible to witness it without taking it as an authentic and major part of the character's life history. It shapes Dr Banks in very real, important ways that are essential to her character's actions and motivations in the movie. To dismiss Hannah as ""dream sequences"" is disrespect bordering on sacrilege.Did any reviews you've read mention that the aliens think very differently than we do, and that their language, their entire basis for reasoning is based on their seeing time very differently than we do? This is another key to the story, for the clues dropped throughout the film, for the aliens' being very much in the here-and-now while having a very *different* concept of the meaning of ""now"".I read linguistics at university, and one of my favourite professors started every lecture (reportedly over his entire career with the declaration that ""a *language* is the *definition* of a specific *culture*, at a specific *place*, at a specific *time.* Change the culture, the place, or the time, and the language *must* change; *when* the language changes, that is *irrefutable proof* that at least one of the others has as well."" (His emphasis.) Stick *that* in your pipe and smoke it while you're watching this, along with the question of the natures of time and of perception, and of how people in power have historically reacted to things they don't understand and aren't in control of.The climax is a bit of a deus ex machina, and there are a few questions any hard-SF fan will quibble over, but this WILL blow your mind if you let it. Do see the film, and ponder."
" Close Encounter of the Interstellar Kind
",0.5267,0.9906,2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Arrival is one of the front-runners in this current award season and the hype is deserved. This is brainy sci-fi for intelligent audiences, which means it is not a bravura shoot-em-up- with-laser-beams in the vein of Star Wars or Independence Day. I would say it is in the territory of Contact, but thankfully without the kitsch sentimentalism. This is Close Encounter of the Interstellar Kind. Linguistic professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is called upon by the military led by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) when a dozen shell-shaped spaceships appear at different locations on Earth. Together with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), she is tasked with interpreting what the aliens want.That's it, saying anything more of the plot would ruin a profoundly unique and I dare say, spiritual experience. This is based on a simple ""what if"" scenario, teased out into a larger tapestry and then hitting the climatic note with such panache that you walked out of the cinema hall more in touch with life. Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer have adapted Ted Chiang's multiple award-winning short story, Story of Your Life, superbly. We are lulled into a state of awe, then once we are entranced by the strangeness of it all we are entrusted with multiple conceptions of what is right and normal. Villeneuve's storytelling is hinged on open-ended dialogue, quiet but tense scenes, dream- like cinematography and intensity exuding from characters in stressful situations. Not once does the story talk down to you, explaining difficult concepts through simplistic expositions. The narrative respects you enough to connect the dots (or circles) yourself. The story isn't just a clever intellectual exercise, it also carries great emotional heft. It accomplishes it through Amy Adams' excellent performance. Her deep emotions of love and loss boiling just beneath her melancholic exterior is a beauty to behold. Louise Banks is our anchor in this strange world and it is through her we not only learn what the aliens want, but we also enter into her mind-space and see her life as a mother. Despite some minor missteps, Arrival has so much verve that most people will just dismiss them. The whole exercise is stimulating, intelligent and thoughtful, with something wise to say about the human condition. We won't get many films of this caliber in a year so it would be wise not to miss it. Villeneuve has reached a new epoch in filmmaking with this and I can't wait to see what he does with Blade Runner 2049."
" Huge Human Slap (Not only for philosophy junkies).
",0.4404,0.9505,2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"Humankind feels threaten by the sudden invasion of alien ships. Following the unexpected personal journey of Amy Adams' character and how her passion for linguistics can be the world's only hope. A powerful science fiction which might be hard to dig if loose focus (which is very unlikely to happen). In spite of it's low pace, I felt intrigued from beginning to end. The first half of the movie uses a high doze of suspense with the unknown of the alien's intentions. Once you get passed the tension, you start experiencing the magic of the discoveries and new fears of our little human friends facing something way out of their league. Even though the film is thought provoking all the way to the credits, some things didn't fully clicked in. At moments you can feel overwhelmed with the amount of information. But once I left the theater, it all made sense. I loved that after feeling of ""It was right there the whole time!""... when it really kicks in, as in this case. Even though it has been sold as an ""Alien movie"" I don't thing it belongs there; this is something else. An outstanding accomplishment of director Villeneuve, who manages to make a film around written language through mesmerizing photography and powerful performances. Slapping us all humans without compromising the characters' transformation and story."
" What Is Your Purpose On Earth? Very meta sci-fi; Adams excels
",0.5423,-0.1531,2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"ARRIVAL (2016) ***1/2 Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg. Intriguing alien invasion sci-fi drama with bereaved linguist Adams enlisted to decipher the indistinguishable language of the ambiguous creatures who have come to Earth with unknown reasons and instead discovering even more than she has bargained for. Based on Ted Chiang's story ""Story of Your Life"" the script by Eric Heisserer explores some very meta ideas (""What is your purpose on Earth?"" to begin with) while director Denis Villeneuve balances the near documentary-like aesthetic employed thru out. A chill-inducing production design by Patrice Vermette also underscores the prickling sensations of the unknown. Kudos to the nicknames of Abbott & Costello given to the alien duo."
" Sci Fi At Its Best
",0.6369,0.984,2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"""There are days that define your story beyond your life""Holy crap. This is probably Denis's best and most emotionally powerful film. Within the first three minutes I was on the verge of tears. Every performance in this film was fantastic. The cinematography, like usual for Denis Villeneuve, is amazing and probably the best of year. The score is very unique and goes back and forth from being mysterious to somber. The visual effects, while scarce, are used effectively. And since this is a film that focuses on story more than insane effects, the fact that they are well done adds to the story. The story is unbelievably gripping, but the first half of the film contains some of the most amazing atmosphere and build up I have ever seen in any sci-fi film. Now some people have complained about the last third, but I won't get into that mostly because I feel like I need to rewatch it to fully understand what I saw. But to be honest, I had no problem with the third act.But the thing that I love about this movie most is that this is a story of trying to understand what is unknown or hard to understand rather than trying to push it away or destroy it. Even with current events it came out at a perfect time. It shows that there are people who don't want to understand the unknown and that there are some who will do everything they can to understand. It shows both the care and carelessness of humanity. And it shows that life is somewhat of a gift and we shouldn't waste it trying to push away, but embrace. And that might sound really pretentious but it really struck a cord with me. I would say everyone should watch this movie, even if some parts of it I don't fully understand. But like the main character I feel compelled to return to find out more, to figure out..... Man that sounded really cheesy.100/100"
" I shouldn't have liked it, but I did.
",-0.1695,0.3689,2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"So much going against it, mainly there was not much to it. For a very long time, there's no ticking clock. No tension. No threat.I went in trying to pay attention because of the mixed reviews and that many said they were confused. I generally wasn't confused although it tried very hard to be such. The ""loose"" chronology was apparently verified by experts, but was sometimes hard to swallow.The opening was effective on trying establish sympathy for Amy Adams character. But it took me out of such when she didn't age, although the daughter's life probably covered 15 years, at least. Then, of course, we find out that the birth of the daughter had not happened.Although I enjoyed Adams performance, it really turned out there was nothing to the character. The supposed sympathy card about the daughter was the cheat and it never happened. Sure, she was a brave scientist, but not much else.Found it jarring that the arrival and lead up to the meeting of the aliens was slow and methodical but then once they met them, we quickly cut to the post-op of that meeting. The tension and anxiety was evident but then the twisting of gravity (because the ship was tall and thin) was just a device and not really interesting.And there was not much to the rest of the film, where most of the tension (albeit manufactured) of the piece exists. The soldiers get paranoid. The Chinese get paranoid. Although probably plausible in the real world, I just had a tough time with it in the context of a film.But the concept was very interesting. Shades of Slaughterhouse 5. I had also seen another very interesting time movie called ""Predestination,"" but had a serious paradox. The paradox questions came up with Arrival. Why was she having dreams about a daughter that she never had? Why was she having visions of a meeting with the Chinese general she never had? But I bought it.But it dropped the ball on what ""gift"" the aliens supposedly gave Earth. And was the daughter what would save the aliens in the future?"
" It Finally Arrived
",0.0,0.9845,2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"By now Denis Villeneuve has proved he's master of visually striking and atmospheric films. And 'Arrival' is visually stunning film, and it has a substance. The atmosphere screams upcoming doom and every scene is built up like some big disaster is going to happen soon. It raises many philosophical questions and also tries to answer them (how good are the answers depends everyone's own personal beliefs and philosophy) Many call 'Arrival' thinking man's sci-fi. Within two months I've seen it twice. 'Arrival' is kind of film that makes you think over it (if you like to analyze the meaning of art and life) and it holds up the second viewing. Although the plot twist is already known, but 'Arrival' is built up with edge of your seat suspense and atmosphere, that it doesn't ruin the experience of the second viewing. Describing the plot is quite pointless here as it will ruin the surprise and twist moments of the film, but all the plot elements are glued together masterfully, that the cracks are not visible. One can say that second viewing is even necessary.Three main actors did terrific job so Amy Adams and Forest Whitaker both deserve an Oscar for their efforts.By far the best science fiction film in recent years. Although the ending seems little sappy the film is one big whole and much greater then the sum of it's parts. I will definitely watch this film a third and a fourth and a fifth time, I am sure about that."
" A masterwork from the greatest working director, Denis Villeneuve!
",0.6696,0.969,2017-01-12 00:00:00,10,"""The Arrival"", directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring Amy Adams, is certainly one of the best films of the year and one of the finest films ever made about the events surrounding first contact with extra-terrestrials. First, Ill state the obvious. As with any Villeneuve film, the photography, score and performances were spot-on. I think this movie accurately depicts how different world powers would approach this situation and executes that perfectly. Amy Adams is more than deserving of an Oscar for her performance and I can honestly say that after viewing this movie only once, I already want to see it again. This film explores several concepts including, the power of language and communication, the theory of time and what it means to leave behind a carbon footprint on this Earth. I can safely say that this is Mr. Villeneuve's finest work yet and one of my all time favorites. This movie is a timeless masterpiece that will resonate with it's audience and have you thinking for a while after."
" Arrival is like Contact
",0.3612,0.9612,2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,"This movie Arrival has the feeling of Contact because both movies have a main character that is a middle aged female. In both movies there are a lot of flashbacks and memories and an interplay between now, past and future. The dark oval shaped space crafts looked like the Evil eye in Lord of the Rings, Mordor. And I thought this movie had elements of ET - like the way the base camp was set up and the plastic like uniforms the team had to wear when visiting the alien creatures. At first I thought this was a pretty original idea for a movie, but when I watched the movie further, I noticed that so many Hollywood movies had already experimented and displayed almost all of the parts of the science fiction story line and plot. Mixing in components of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 2001: A Space Odyssey. I guess it costs the directors and film sponsors lots of money to make a movie like this, a couple of million, and the movie needs to be a success in order for it to break even financially. I can sense that Arrival stayed within the status quo of what a Hollywood audience would consider safe. It did not come up with anything evil or scary instead it stayed within the comfort-level of the general film population. What I would have liked to have seen is some brand new original ideas regarding aliens, and the idea that these aliens have a different technique of writing is not different enough in my mind. To me, it means that aliens and humans are more the same then different in their ways of thinking, communicating and processing information. A more original idea would have been something along the lines of a non-verbal but pure sensory communication. Something that could not be data analyzed within the house-hold computer."
" Review of Arrival:
",0.0,-0.9325,2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,A linguist finds herself alienated and separated from her husband after the death of her daughter in an accident. Haunted by the memories of what has gone before everything starts to change for her after the arrival of twelve cone shaped alien spacecraft on the planet. Shortly afterwards she finds herself reunited with her ex as they are both chosen to act as the translators with the alien race. The aliens play with the former memories she has of her daughter as they start the communication process and the critical point of the film is when they enable her to have a vision of a future conversation she could have with a Chinese general in order to change the future time line. The film ends with the linguist reuniting with her ex through them both hoping for another daughter.I will add the rider that some of my companions thought that the linguist has never had a daughter and has never been married and that the death of the daughter we see is part of her visions regarding the death of a daughter which she will have in the future. Although this particular interpretation was far too complex for me it just goes to show how confusing some parts of the film actually were.
" Awful, Terrible, Waste of Time and Money
",-0.836,-0.8454,2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"Just another pseudo intellectual film. Bird man, Enemy and Arrival all the same. I may exclude Bird man out of this though. Arrival is truly a terrible awful film with a blunt ending. There is nothing special about this film. It assumes that there is no Free will and everything is predetermined and nothing can be altered. The film is simply about Aliens in a pebble kind of a craft land on earth and try to teach their language to humans just so that they (aliens) can be helped 3000 years later. Terrible imagination.We as humans are yet to understand ""TIME"" We have no idea what it is. This film makes preposterous postulations about time. There are 2 good things in this film. Camera, especially when moves with the copter. That girl, Amy Adams she looks nice, good performance. Forest Whitaker the over acting dude, even though over acts or over reacts still I like him but this film wasted him or the director wasted him. Terrible movie which wasted my money and my precious ""TIME"" Wish I had the power to predict crap.Ask your friends to give one star and let us bring down the unacceptable rating for this film."

I really wanted to like this film but could never get into the right mood of suspense and excitement. Instead I found ridiculously pretentious and boring right from the start. I could feel that many people in the theater felt the same, lots of sighs and laughter in the wrong places. The story is very vague in many places and is often cut off in a very irritating way. The film is obviously aiming for something of higher quality than for example Independence day but falls flat because it lacks both substance and feeling. This is not even close to a masterpiece like 2001. The film tries to communicate some message about communication, world peace, time, meaning of life, and how it's all connected or something but ends up a mess. The two main characters were very cliché and kept irritating me throughout the film. They were the two chosen one's who understand everything no one else does and ends up saving the world."

The researchers try to find out how the aliens communicate with them. The kind of talking and writing of the aliens seems to be untranslatable. And I think - from what is shown to the cinema audience - it is impossible to make progress of translation in such a short time. The complexity of the alien talking seems to be so high that human being would need hundreds of years to get a clue how to do it. But the plot has to go on, and so arbitrary action takes place. The movie lost my interest and somehow it ended. I cannot remember anymore how. After two weeks I forgot most of the plot already..."

" Good as a brainless sci-fi flick, but letdown if you're expecting more
",0.2382,-0.4781,2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Arrival, both in pre-release hype and in cinematic progression, builds up its viewers to expect greatness characteristic of select great mainstream 21st century directors like Christopher Nolan and Terrence Malick. At times, even, Arrival's voice overs are reminiscent of Malick's style, or its suspenseful build-up similar to that of Inception or other Nolan pieces. Yet sadly, in the end, Arrival falls far short of those expecting greater things from the movie, devolving into a cheap and corny love story and a complex problem resolved by a silly temporal paradox rather than a more thoughtful/complex solution. The acting quality helps ground this movie in some regards, with good performances from Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner (Forest Whittaker's role is okay, but his fluctuant, sometimes present, sometimes absent accent is a faint scar on a movie supposedly hinging on language and linguistics). If you can release your mind entirely to accept total fluidity of time, then the resolution of the movie - ""past Amy Adams"" at a discrete time learning the solution to the ""Chinese problem"" from ""future Amy Adams"" - then the plot resolution may be at least plausible, but even then it seems horribly cheap and unsatisfactory as a solution for such a complex matter as preventing war with aliens. Moreover, from a language and linguistics perspective, the movie is similarly disappointing, creating what is touted as an immensely complex alien language that - while represented by different symbols that we are familiar with (much like Chinese or Sanskrit, for example), is in fact no more complex in meaning than the languages of Earth (it perhaps has even less depth of language than the massive vocabulary of classical Chinese). And while I, as a former language and linguistics major, correspond to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis that language directly influences the way an individual thinks (of course, in far more words than this), the idea that Amy Adams learns to read the future from a mere few months of exposure to an alien language - which she at that time still barely understands - is such a bastardization of this hypothesis that it really does the hypothesis intellectual harm. Long story short, if you plan to watch this movie, watch it as a sci-fi flick...expecting more, particularly on an intellectual level, will leave you sorely disappointed."

I was waiting to see something with a sense during the endless film but I can't. Just when the octopus appears I opened my eyes with some expectations. But no. A lovely lady understood in a short time (and also the octopus) what to say and how. An advanced civilization need for a primitive one (us, of course) how to survive in a 3000 years (!) and that's why they were here. Well...in the end of the day it's an emotional sci-fi film.I don't understood the message of the film and what the writer/director wanted to say.

It was intriguing, therefore, to discover that he has branched out into Sci-Fi here with Arrival, in which 12 alien spacecraft descend on Earth and station themselves at random locations across the globe. True to form, however, Villeneuve delivers one of the most intelligent, creative and insightful Sci-Fi movies of recent times.In Arrival, a language expert, Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) must analyse and decipher what the aliens are saying. As she spends more time with the aliens, she is haunted by the memories of what happened to her daughter, Hannah, which is revealed in a heartbreaking opening sequence accompanied by Banks' narration as she explains that ""there are days that define your story beyond your life"".This notion of the predetermined, as well as the recurrence of Hannah, becomes a metaphor for one of the key questions of this story; would you do anything to change your life when you know what is going to happen? Villeneuve manages to enhance this notion further with superb use of imagery. The spacecrafts are colossal, frightening, looming structures that hover above the ground yet are almost featureless beyond their unusual lens-like shape. The aliens are huge; so big in fact that we only ever see their bottom halves. Both designs serve as a reminder that there is a much bigger force at play affecting our lives. Meanwhile, Villeneuve creates an element of mystery behind these shapes and designs; what is inside these strange, hovering objects? What do the aliens look like in their entirety? In providing the audience with visual reminders of the unknown, Villeneuve also manages to imply that whilst our stories may be 'defined', we don't necessarily know how or why.If there is one flaw with Arrival, it is a minor one in that as it reaches its conclusion, we discover the real reason why the aliens have come to Earth. Whilst the build up to this point is intelligently and exquisitely formulated, the basis of their purpose feels surprisingly weak and short-sighted. Ironically, despite the film being so adept at developing the theme of life being already defined, it perhaps needed to be another 10 minutes or so longer so that the audience could obtain some degree of closure on the impact of the aliens' invasion.Otherwise, Arrival is a majestic, beautifully created piece of cinema that is steeped in melancholy and flows with a real elegance. There are plenty of comparisons to be made to this, including Interstellar and Inception (the spacecraft tunnel scenes are very much reminiscent of the latter), and also Gareth Edwards' Monsters. However, Arrival feels that bit more taut, succinct and complete, almost effortless in its delivery and more profound with its message.For the full review and other movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"
" Monumentally Stupid
",-0.5267,-0.9562,2017-01-08 00:00:00,4,"I don't normally write reviews but after seeing so many reviews praising this ridiculous film I just had to say something. It is not a spoiler to say this is an alien contact film. I am an SF fan of 50 years standing. I have read thousands of SF books and seen most SF films. I am a fan. So when I see something as idiotic as this I leave the cinema full of regret at the wasted opportunity. It's hard to talk about the film without giving away key plot points so I'll be general. Amy Adams first attempts at communication are laughable. Let's just say the method used would never, ever be the first choice of anyone with half a brain. We also get the oft repeated cliché about certain aspects of the military. Perhaps it is true that the military are that stupid but I prefer to think not. Good acting cannot save silly ideas and the premise of this movie was just that. Silly. But worse the pseudo science was also dumb. The fundamental appeal of SF for me has always been ideas. The science doesn't have to be perfect but it has to be a little believable. This movie was not . . intelligent."
" A Sci-Fi Drama that will blown you away.
",0.0,0.9726,2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Damn, the storytelling of this movie is so powerful and so emotional, it messes your mind (a lot, in a great way). This is a grown-up science fiction drama movie that sustains fear and tension while affecting the love and loss aspect itself. A powerhouse performance by Adams but I would give the spotlight to Villeneuve, Chiang, Heisserer, and Young. IMO, Arrival already surpass Interstellar as my top choice in sci-fi drama genre. The last 20 minutes and the revelation of this movie leave me breathless, I can't stop saying ""no way, that can't be like that, no no no"" until the credits came up. One of the best ending of all time. Do not seek for spoiler(s), it will ruin the cinematic experience from this masterpiece."
" Creative and Impactful Diversion of Science Fiction
",0.4404,0.9705,2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"A rare type of Spielberg-Nolan style science-fiction drama full of metaphors that is steep in its specific themes told in a sense of realism. The film is an unusual discovery, it starts emotionally, moves in a deliberate pacing, slowly builds up a puzzle of complex paradox and ends up stunningly impactful, amplifying the questions of existential dilemma. It does not need any action sequences, it is all about life, language and unity that bring to the twisted concept of the overall plot development with several hints throughout the entire story, further surprising audiences to view it from different fascinating ways. Amy Adams gains respects for her brilliant performance as a believable thinker and expert communicator while her emotions are handled well in order to engage the entire structure of the film. The theme song ""On the Nature of Daylight"" in both the opening and ending of the movie, as well as scores composed by Johann Johannsson enhance the the atmosphere of the film especially the thrilling suspense of invasions, the horror moments during the contact and the emotional depth on life perception. The arrival of the extra terrestrial amazes viewers on how creatively a science fiction may diverge from its generic aspects and link to life - telling us that life is a journey without destination and to live as if the answer is, even if you have known everything about the future."
" Beyond Sci Fi
",0.0,0.5023,2017-01-06 00:00:00,9,"It is not about the plot but it is the message that it deliver. Too many problems in communication between the human nowadays. How can we influence with the way we communicate.I love the way it link daily conversation (between Hannah and Louise) to the part of communicating with aliens. Everything it is tightly attached to address one key message: the way we communicate will affect our lives.Wonderful movies, spectacular Amy Adam. This movie reminds me of some one shot manga call Omoide Emanon which is about 3 billions year -old girl and her memories keep passing on through different generations."
" Recommended
",0.2023,0.9848,2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"I would say Arrival is one of the most over-rated movies of 2016. Arrival starts with an overwhelming thrust but you will loose your focus eventually with the run time. If you are a big fan of drama, surely you will like the slow story building but I am pretty uncertain whether you would like the sudden cliché ending/death of the movie, along with your dateless patience. Loopholes are also pretty obvious, though not a big problem to follow the story line.Arrival might remind you of 2001:Space Odyssey with a heavy flavor of Kubrick style. However, in my point of view, Arrival is crudely made with lack of sophistication.Now lets say some good words.Amy Adams was extraordinary, and incredible. I kept wondering on her effort and aptness throughout the movie. Well deserved performance for Academy Award! Soundtracks are well produced, especially the starting and the ending one. I bet you will keep listening the tracks for hours. Hats off to Mr. Richter! Overall: Recommended, and 7/10."
" Not A Masterpiece, An Achievement
",-0.5096,0.9988,2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Arrival was one of my most anticipated movies of 2016 I loved all the trailers for this film and the talent behind it made me even more excited to see the final product and I can safely say that I was blown away by the final product. This is a slow burning, thought provoking and incredibly intriguing Sci Fi masterpiece that I think in future years will become a classic. Amy Adams gives one of the greatest performances of her entire career in this film, she perfect embodies someone who is determined in her pursuit but damaged by her experiences and it's a performance that will hopefully give her an Oscar. Jeremy Renner was just perfect casting for this film he was incredibly convincing in this film and his chemistry with Adams was fantastic. Forrest Whitaker was great in this film and it was nice to see a different type of role from him. The slow pacing of this film worked perfectly it helped to build up the slow burning suspense and gave the characters more time to be developed better. The special effects in this film are also fantastic mainly because they are used sparingly as it is clear that the focus is more on the characters. Denis Villeneuve did such an amazing job directing this film he really sucked you into the situation and made it seem more life like. This film asks a lot of questions about humanity and how it interacts and these questions are incredibly intriguing and thought provoking it forces the audience to think on real life and accurate the events of this film are to real life. The whole mystery of why the aliens are here is done perfectly you're more that likely to change your mind at least once and when a mystery like that is built up for so long it's hard to make the eventual discovery satisfying but in this case it was, the eventual reveal makes you look at this film in an entirely different way, the film also doesn't feel the need to answer every question it asks leaving certain things ambiguous that allows the viewer to think on their own answers. Arrival is a film that trusts the intelligence and patience of its audience, it is complex and thought provoking but is never boring or dull. This is not only the greatest film of 2016 but it's possibly one of the greatest I've ever seen. I truly believe that in the future this film will become a classic. 100%/A+"
" Science fiction does not consist only of special effects.
",0.4019,0.9582,2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"First of all i saw a lot of people bored during the movie but they came for 'the action', 'the peew-peew' or 'the boom'. This masterpiece (yes i said masterpiece) is all about a mind-blowing story. If you do not want to think, go and watch another 'peew-peew' based movie. It is a SMART movie.At the beginning the story goes a little bit slow but it must be that way. After one point you start to understand everything and at this point you start to get excited. It's just like a puzzle whenever you can solve puzzles, then everything begins to flourish.Give it a try and think while you watch."
" Am I the only person who found this movie confusing?
",-0.2263,0.3662,2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"I found this movie confusing, and that spoiled it. From the beginning I presumed that all the main character's vivid memories of a daughter who eventually dies as images of the past. Rather like the main character in Gravity, a woman psychologically hobbled by the loss of a young daughter. When I left the theatre, I was still not sure if what the clues I saw in the movie were telling me were what the filmmaker wanted me to take away. Many people have said they found this movie human, emotional and moving. Was all it was trying to tell me that the aliens' gift to some people was to see their future? This confusion spoiled the movie for me. Too bad, as acting performances were very good, and technically the movie was very good."
" This soup needs more salt, and more soup. Contains spoilers!
",0.0,-0.9525,2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"Despite the almost universal appreciation of Arrival as a smart and thought-provoking sci-fi film, actual scientists and hardcore nerds will find it clumsy and lightweight. The plot seems deliberately unscientific, from the non-taxonomic name given by scientists to the aliens, to the lack of biologists in any of the assigned teams (!!!), it becomes clear that the writers put science to one side, and concentrated on the fiction, rehashing first-contact plots from great films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Signs, The Abyss and Contact (they are all shamelessly plundered in Arrival!) Adams' turn as linguist Dr. Banks is up to her typically high standard, but against the improbable and sanguine plot, her character flounders. The concept that she alone, among hundreds of scientists, could initiate communication just by her skills as a linguist is farcical. All other scientists are portrayed as clueless, terrified idiots. Renner, as a theoretical scientist of an undisclosed and apparently useless field provides some much needed mirth, but his character contributes nothing to the plot save some future DNA. But Arrival really falls apart for sci-fi fans as soon as it is revealed that the aliens experience non-linear time, and pass the technique of doing so on to Dr. Banks. At this juncture an inquiring mind should consider the magnitude of the concept of a creature that can exist in non-linear time - they are essentially omniscient and immortal, being able to access any point in their lifetime at will. They can also change their past and future, essentially being able to create parallel universes at will. Banks proves that this is the case by accessing information from General Chang's wife, suggesting that Banks can access her past and change it (she previously did not have the info on Chang's wife's dying words, at least not in the linear time-going-forward presentation of the movie). With the power of time travel and multiverse-hopping at her fingertips, surely Banks would teach the technique to her future daughter, allowing her to never have to access the part of their lives where she dies of cancer and Banks' life falls apart. Why would Banks persist in re-living her tragic future instead of changing her past and living a parallel life in a parallel universe? Sentimentality over her daughter would likely become less significant once Banks had simultaneously lived a billion different lives with a billion different daughters in parallel universes. Perhaps that dehumanization would have been a good subject to focus on - we might see Banks allowed to change her tragic future, but deciding to keep it. But that didn't happen in this film. Banks would also have had these abilities for her whole life, not just from the moment (in linear time) that the aliens arrive. Thus she would have been aware of their language and writing without all that torturous study and work. The aliens, whatever their agenda in visiting Earth in the 21st Century, would also have known that Banks would be their contact, so why send eleven other ships across the globe, terrifying the planet and risking war? And why did it take so long for them to start 'writing' and communicating with the US team? The potential sci-fi generated from the concept of non-linear time is genuinely mind-blowing, and is not even touched-on in Arrival. The movie relies on the emotional subplot of Banks' 'future' memories and undisclosed 'future' relationship with Donnelly (Renner) - but the alien visit and subsequent time-skipping-ability don't provide a very interesting counterpoint to this. Essentially this is a story about a woman dealing with the tragic death of her daughter... oh yeah, then some aliens help her to save the world from the Chinese. Look back to the movie 'Signs' - similar concept, a family struggling to come to terms with the death of the mother amid an alien invasion. In Signs, the invasion scenario drives the plot forward, allowing the characters to develop and an interesting story arc to grow. In Arrival the contact scenario nearly starts and then stops a war, but has little impact on the characters other than the omniscience thing, which is rather wasted on visual rhymes and whimsical sentimentality. Arrival is vapid sci-fi, and there's a place for that in cinema, but when the plot (and marketing) of a film hangs on the science of linguistics, concepts of time and existence and is delivered with full-force tepid brown- graded realism - that science better be excellent. In my view, the Jurassic Park homage during the helicopter scene was a disservice to a film with a superior vapid sci-fi concept."
" ""Arrival""- A masterpiece of the Science Fiction genre. One of the best films of 2016.
",0.8519,0.999,2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Every so often, you encounter one of those rare films that reminds you of the sheer magic and emotion that films are capable of crafting and creating. And 2016's magnificent Science Fiction drama ""Arrival"" is most certainly one of those rare treats. An emotional tale directed by Denis Villeneuve, ""Arrival"" is an absolutely stunning exploration of the unknown- whether it be what lays beyond our stars, or what lurks deep inside of our own heart.Linguist expert Louise Banks (Amy Adams) awakens one day to discover along with the rest of humanity that extraterrestrial crafts have begun to land all over the world, hovering ominously just off the ground, seemingly in waiting for something. Soon enough, she is whisked away to Montana with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), in the hopes that the two can help the military to start communication with the beings on-board. Through hard work and perseverance, eventually a dialog is established with the extraterrestrial ""heptapods."" However, Louise's own emotional conflict and the growing paranoia of the world at large- fueled by an increasing media circus- threatens to destroy all of the work done to create a peaceful communication between the two races.The film is at its core a very character-centered drama set to the backdrop of a classic sci-fi alien story. However, the extraterrestrial beings here don't threaten to destroy the planet... their presence makes humanity threaten to destroy itself out of fear. It's quite clever and consistently enthralling. Much of the film's runtime is devoted simply to seeing the alien beings trying to communicate their points to our human leads with their wildly different way of ""speaking."" But it's constantly intriguing and will grab your attention instantly, never letting go. It's fascinating. Most science fiction films would rather spend their time blowing up landmarks while broad archetypal characters spout one-liners and pretentious techno- babble. ""Arrival"" instead spends its time blowing our minds over and over with its very real drama and shockingly realistic portrayal of ""first contact.""The performances, and indeed the exceptional writing courtesy Eric Heisserer are what makes the film however. This is a movie all about character and emotion, and Amy Adams rises to the occasion with one of the greatest performances of her career. She injects such a pure, pained and sympathetic soul into Louise, and you'll be behind her completely throughout the entire film. She's one of the most compelling characters of the year, and I honestly hope Adams receives the recognition she deserves for her turn as their character. Renner is an exceptional supporting lead, and continues to stretch his acting chops, much as he has many times in the past few years. As much as I adore him in his more action-oriented roles, it's just so refreshing seeing him challenged in a more complex and realistic performance. I also highly admired Forest Whitaker as a senior military official who serves as our third and final lead, and he gives a good sense of both authority and sympathy in a role that could have otherwise come across as flat.Denis Villeneuve solidifies his position as perhaps one of the most important and invaluable filmmakers working today with his excellent and expert guidance of the story. In every way his work is a revelation, and when combining efforts with the stunning cinematography of Bradford Young, Villeneuve crafts one of the most beautiful films of the year in virtually every sense- aesthetically and emotionally. His sense of scope, scale, composition and flow is just wonderful, and each and every choice he makes is carefully calculated to serve story and character in the best of ways.In the end, ""Arrival"" emerges as not only a fantastic and stunning work on its own, but easily claims its position as one of the greatest films of 2016. It's an immense achievement in storytelling and drama, and its expert exploration of the science-fiction genre puts it on the same league as classics like ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Yes, it is that good, and I can only hope that the minor degree of backlash from people who have found it ""boring"" or ""confusing"" does not dissuade others from going in with an open mind. Because this film is pure cinematic magic in any and every sense.""Arrival"" easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10."
" Slow and Boring
",-0.3182,0.6073,2017-01-02 00:00:00,1,"The show just lumbered along and along, we were sure it was going to get better but it never did. This whole docile quiet act that the aliens had for the entire movie was stupid as was the fact that some idiot would go against them and they would do nothing. The fact that they looked like they had no agility in their ""hands"" but they built these awesome advanced ships but they look like Octopi. Then the whole thing with Amy Adams just figuring out these circles in just a few weeks time and by the end she is basically communicating without assistance like yeah right. Then the worst part, you are actually happy for five minutes when she convinces the world what she knows and you expect some kind of cool climax with the aliens and they just fly away. Shoot to the scene where Amy Adams has some kind of flashback about her family and the movie is over. We want our money and 2 hours back."
" There is nothing going on in the movie.
",0.0,0.4866,2017-01-02 00:00:00,1,"I just came home from this movie and I still cant get the sensation of how bad the movie was out of my head.THERE NOTHING HAPPENING IN THIS MOVIE: aliens come and then aliens go away no explanations why! The end... Booooring!!! A 2 hour long movie that can be described in 2 sentences. There is no action no drama.. no nothing. When I viewed the trailer I had the impression it was a junk of a movie and didn't want to see it, but after a month my sister-in-law said she really wanted to see it, so I checked IMDb score, which is inexplicably high. So I thought to myself: ""Maybe I am wrong, maybe it will be a good movie"". And I went. BIG MISTAKE...I don't understand why it has 8.3 score O_o Please save your money and stay home!"
" Boring
",-0.3182,0.9469,2017-01-02 00:00:00,4,Movie didn't achieve that purpose whom were everyone expecting. Shallow story. Characters missing that certain something. Not as intriguing as it could be. A good selection of actors. More elaborate story should have been. In my opinion even District 9 had a better story line connected to creatures. It could have been much better and more interesting regarding characters and their past. The film would not be so boring that we all are displayed side creatures their actual intent of arrival in the country and their origin.In my opinion movie had scored such a success only because of the experienced actors who had with their great acting pull out the movie from debacle.
" Pretentious, depressing and boooooooooooring
",-0.3818,0.9581,2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"I love cinema and I love movies. But, boy! that one was hard to take. I don't usually write negative reviews, because I like to spend my time and my words on the movies that I love and not on the movies that I hated. But since this movie has such a high score on IMDb (more than 8!) and some people are calling that crap ""a masterpiece"" I felt forced to write something about it. Science-fiction movies are not my favorite, but if they are amazing, I can really love them. I loved Blade Runner, Alien, Matrix, and Interstellar, to name a few. Those movies are masterpieces!Arrival is pretentious, depressing and super boring, and, as somebody said over here, it has more holes than a Swiss cheese. The script has many flaws, and nobody seems to notice that. We are not stupid, you know? The ""aliens"" (those ridiculous giant squids with elephant skin) say that they need the humans every 3,000 years. Why? Nobody bothers to explain that. Then, a professor who speaks many languages is supposed to translate the ""language"" of these aliens that sounds, as somebody also said over here, something like ""jfhjkdfgkdkjhakjagfjgfhj"". So ridiculous!All the characters -with the exception of the one of Louise- are completely empty. And we only feel for her because in the beginning her daughter dies, but she becomes quite annoying with her suffering face and her mascara on her eyelashes (who would bother to paint her eyelashes on a moment like that?). Who are the other characters? a bunch of ""nobodies"", and we really don't feel for them. In a moment I thought: if the aliens kill all these people, who is going to care? The future-husband: is he a physicist? his role is completely superfluous. Then: the ""bad guys"" are, of course, China, Russia and other anti-American countries, who decide to cut off the communication and attack the aliens. Boooooooh!Some people say that this movies is deep and ""intellectual"". Well, if you want deep and intellectual, go read some philosophy books, and don't waste your time on a stupid pseudo- intellectual-pseudo-moral-and-pseudo-science-fiction movie. Arrival is so boring that I got really distracted by Amy's ugly and pointy nose. I almost fell asleep and I never ever fall asleep in movies. So, at the end, what did these aliens do? They almost caused the Earth's destruction and ""blessed"" Louise by making her learn their language, which makes her see the future -like a curse-, and know the horrible death of her daughter as a teenager. Such a treat! I would give ""Arrival"" a 2, but since the music was good I give it a 3. If this movie wins any award at the Golden Globes or at the Oscars, we can say that Americans finally lost their sense of good cinema and art. Greetings from Madrid!"
" Failed to meet expectations
",-0.5106,0.8888,2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"I was so excited to see the Arrival when it started to show in theaters. After a long wait I got excitedly took a seat in the cinema. But the film was filled with confusion from the beginning. Then I continued to watch with patience, thinking that my time cycle would be within in time.There was still no excitement when the first half of movie was over, but there were many question marks and a boring stasis. Unfortunately, this situation continued in the second half, even when the movie was over, we were left alone with many questions.The questions that asked in the movie and the rationale in the fiction were nice, but the gaps in the script were extremely making me uncomfortable. It will be a disappointment if you watch Arrival with an expectation of full satisfaction as in Nolan movies, but if you do not question every detail, you can still enjoy it.Unfortunately this situation is the one that disturb me the most in movies. Apart from fiction and script, the music and visuals were beautiful. I am giving #6/10 point by being so generous."
