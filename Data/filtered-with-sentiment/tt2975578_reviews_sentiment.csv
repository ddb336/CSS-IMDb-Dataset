" Best Than The First (my opinion)
",0.6369,-0.1779,2021-02-08 00:00:00,8,"This one felt like it should have been the first film, it was much more expecting and more wide spread around the city. The fear was even more heightened, and I could watch this over and over."
" This movie delivers everything is says it will.
",0.0,0.9837,2021-02-04 00:00:00,9,"Great movie overall. You're getting exactly what it promises on the box. At least one million times better than the first one.
Suspenseful, interesting, thought-provoking, and overall thrilling. Exactly as violent as you'd expect with some beauty and mercy interspersed throughout. I liked a lot of things about this movie, and every character was easy to root for.
Definitely see this movie, if it seems at all like something you might enjoy. This delivers!"
" More action than horror
",-0.6077,-0.5267,2021-01-24 00:00:00,7,"An okay follow up to the first movie with more of an action / chase vibe than its predecessor. The movie allows us to view The Purge in a more visceral way, but looses the tension of the initial movie."
" Better than the first, but still not great
",-0.5409,0.9437,2021-01-19 00:00:00,7,"Although it's not as bad as its predecessor, nor is it terrible, The Purge: Anarchy is a dark and overserious little thriller- that is able to tap some of the potential of its interesting concept- but not all of it. First off, and this really goes without saying, but Frank Grillo is an awesome lead in this movie. From generic characters aside, he fully embraces his revenge-filled role and actually gives the audience something to root for, and even something to care about. The worst part of this film is easily the beginning, a stretched out and pointless backstory for our troubled and poorly written characters, and it's just not fun to watch. Not to mention the overserious tones of drama arched over those scenes, as well as a few others throughout, find the film hard to take seriously. It sounds weird to say, but maybe when making these films, don't try to be so serious, because it just ends up feeling gruelling and dull, rather than the fun it can be. The cinematography is still annoying, and there is a few weaker moments post exposition. However, there is quite a few cool little action scenes with Grillo that truly do make the film a lot better. In the end, The Purge: Anarchy is one of those rare sequels that improves upon the original. It's far from perfect, with more capable hands behind the screen it could have been something more, but in the end, it's a fine film, and we may just have to leave it at that.
My Rating: 7/10"

The problem is: this feels much more like an action movie than a horror movie, which makes this movie obnoxious. There are also time conveniences here."

" The Purge: Anarchy
",0.0,-0.9995,2020-11-07 00:00:00,5,"The first Purge film worked well as a home invasion movie and set up the scary concept that would almost inevitably lead to a sequel, and that came the following year, to extend the story. Basically, in 2017, the 28th amendment of the U.S. Constitution is approved, establishing one night a year, 7pm March 21 to 7am March 22, ""The Purge"", in which all crime, including murder, theft, arson and rape is permitted, and all police, fire, and medical emergency services are unavailable for 12 hours. The only rules of the Purge are that high level government officials are not to be disturbed, and high grade weapons, such as explosives, grenades, bazookas, rocket launchers and so on, are forbidden. Those who violate these rules will be publicly executed by hanging. The Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting and a stronger economy. It is intended for catharsis (releasing rage), but in reality, it is a method of artificial population control, as unemployed and poor people are usually the main targets. In 2023, American citizens are preparing for the sixth annual Purge. There are also those who protest against the Purge, including a resistance group led by Carmelo Johns (Michael Kenneth Williams) and his partner Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge), the Stranger from the first film. They successfully hijack government feeds to denounce the New Founding Fathers and their actions. In Los Angeles, working-class waitress Eva Sanchez (Carmen Ejogo), her daughter Cali (ZoÃ« Soul) and Eva's terminally ill father Rico (John Beasley) are preparing to barricade themselves into their apartment. As the Purge alarm sounds, Rico has slipped out and left a note for his family, he has sold himself as a Purge offering in exchange for $100,000 to be paid to Eva and Cali; they are distraught by this. Estranged married couple Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) are driving through the city, when their car breaks down, not long before the Purge is due to begin. Meanwhile, an off-duty Los Angeles Police Department sergeant, Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), plots to kill Warren Grass (Brandon Keener), who whilst drink driving killed his son, and was acquitted on legal technicalities. Despite pleas from his ex-wife Janice (Chad Morgan) to abandon his plans, Barnes drives out into the streets with an armoured car and several weapons, posing as a vigilante. The Purge commences; Shane and Liz try to find a safe hiding place, and Eva and Cali are attacked by their lustful and insulted superintendent Diego (Bruce Almighty's Noel Gugliemi). The women are saved when Diego is gunned down by a paramilitary platoon, who take them to their leader Big Daddy (Jack Conley). Leo passes and rescues the women after killing the troops and wounding Big Daddy. Then they find Shane and Liz hiding in Leo's car. Big Daddy fires at them and damages the car, forcing the group to run. As they navigate the hostile streets, they find evidence that the anti-Purge group are gaining the upper hand against the Purgers. They take guns from an abandoned truck and head to the subways, only to find a pyrotechnic Purging gang that has invaded the tunnel. Shane is wounded, but the group manages to escape after he and Liz destroy the gang's vehicle and blow the propane tank, killing the entire gang. The group returns to the streets, but Eva unknowingly signals a traffic camera to identify them to paramilitary troops who pick up where they are heading. The group reach the apartment of Eva's co-worker Tanya (Final Destination 2's Justina Machado), but there is no car. Tanya's family takes them in, offering dinner and medicine. However, Tanya's sister Lorraine (Roberta Valderrama) proceeds to murder her sister for sleeping with her husband. The group leaves the family to their fate, only to be captured by the masked gang who ambushed Shane and Liz earlier. The gang reveals they do not want to kill them, but to sell them off at an auction, where upper-class Purgers can bid on them for human hunting. The group are taken to a theatre, but Leo subdues and kills a Purger, taking his weapon and night-vision glasses, using the devices to overpower and kill several other attackers. During the chaos, Shane is shot and killed by security forces, and the anti-Purge group enter the compound to kill the security forces and remaining Purgers. Liz chooses to stay with the resistance fighters to retaliate against Shane's murderers, while Leo, Eva, and Cali leave. The three carjack the head Purger, holding him at gunpoint, to drive away. They stop at the home of Warren Grass, five minutes before the end of the Purge. Leo tells the story of his son's death, and ventures into the house despite Eva and Cali's pleas, threatening Warren and his wife. Later, Leo exits the house covered in blood, only to be shot by Big Daddy, who reveal that too few of the lower class are being eliminated during the Purge, which was the original intentions of the New Found Father when the Purge was conceived. Just as Big Daddy is about to kill Leo, Warren appears and kills Big Daddy with a single shot from a handgun, revealing that Leo chose to forgive and spare him. Big Daddy's squad appears while Eva, Cali, and Warren prepare to defend themselves. But the siren blare to signal the end of the Purge, and Warren drives Eva, Cali, and Leo to the hospital as news and police helicopters fly over the city. Also starring Castulo Guerra as Barney, Get Out's LaKeith Stanfield as Young Ghoul Face, and Niko Nicotera as Roddy. This sequel definitely makes the most of being on the outside this time, the political and ethical issues come into play again, the survival of the fittest premise is much more brutal, expect to see a good few things blowing up and bloody kills, it is not that scary, but it is a tense and exciting enough dystopian action horror thriller. Worth watching!"
" Actually thought this was a good sequel
",0.4404,0.9581,2020-11-01 00:00:00,7,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by this purge sequel. I took so long to watch it because of how many there now is, so I thought to stop after the first. But I finally jumped on and I thought it was quite good.Some good action scenes, likeable characters and overall just interesting. Don't get me wrong, it's not a film you'll watch and shout and scream about it to your mates, but it's a good evening watch.Few things that annoyed me. The wife of the couple was incredibly annoying throughout, if you watch you'll know why (don't want to say any spoilers). The film follows the same group through the whole night, which is fine, but you know what the ending is going to be, so can feel dragged out at times. But overall it's decent, like I said before it's a fun, almost mindless watch. If you haven't seen it, but seen the first I recommend."
" This could happened!

Frank Grillo makes all the differences in this movie. He is a actor that you want more of.

" Great story and ""test"" of viewers morality
",0.6249,0.9627,2020-10-24 00:00:00,8,"I loved this movie. It has storyline that is easy to follow, simple and somewhat predictable, but so well made. Characters connect to audience and you can feel what/how they feel. Cast is great, they all did their role well. Main character is fantastic. You can feel his dilemas. What I liked the most about this movie (and all other parts of this francise) is the moral questions we ask ourselves while watching this movie/s.It is one of those movies you'll gladly watch again on TV.
P.S. modern day society differes from midevial ages only by few things. We don't throw sh%=Ã· through the window anymore, we refridgeratos and can fly. Other than that, we are just as sick and perverted as midevial crowd was."

" Higher budget, higher quality?
",0.0,0.5439,2020-07-25 00:00:00,6,"This review contains spoilers.The Purge: Anarchy is the sequel to the The Purge. It is directed by James DeMonaco and stars new cast of characters that try to survive the purge. The story follows multiple perspectives, from a cop out for revenge, a couple that is stranded, to a mother and daughter deep in the city. These plot lines converge and lead to the cop protecting the others.The Purge: Anarchy has a higher budget which it uses to employ more extras and effects. There is absolutely a more grander feel to this movie and it can be felt that a city has gone crazy. That is all that is positive about this movie.The problems with the writing in the first movie remain except that it is only exacerbated with the budget. More ludicrous events will take place on the screen to increase the body count. There is a scene midway through the movie where it explains that the government is seeking out poor areas to increase the deaths caused by the purge. This event is hard to believe as the survivors and even people in the city can film them. It is difficult to believe that the government could be sending full military armed forces to kill poor citizens. Even upon losing a truck, no one suspects or even brings up the overkill the government is doing to the population. The same plot holes such as vacation outside of the United States are not even hand waved here. None of the movie's internal logic makes sense, especially with gangs kidnapping people for the rich to have a gladiator game. These are interesting scenes, but are not fulfilling.The other parts of this movie such as directing, editing, and acting range from bland to decent. Frank Grillo as the police officer is the standout performance here. The rest of the movie's mentioned components are not great.The audience that would like this movie most is one that is willing to heavily suspend their disbelief. A large suspension is needed to simply enjoy the action which is decently shot and choreographed here. My only wish for this movie is that there should have been more commentary. Much of the backstory and politics of this alternate United States is not told through the characters. It is only given by narration. With a lot of tweaks, this series could have been better but now it is only mindless entertainment.I do not recommend The Purge: Anarchy.Grade: D"

" For the $ake of ca$h
",0.0,-0.4226,2020-07-07 00:00:00,2,"Basically, TP:A shows that a) the plot still doesn't work overall and b) DeMonaco blew it again.Thanks to the financial success of the first ""Purge"", Hollywood logic dictates that at least one sequel has to follow. The basic recipe is the same, only the location has changed. Unchanged were the plot holes, lame acting and the lack of feasability; added was a slight depth of the background of the ""Purge"" (but only a little bit, as more might have overtaxed the director).Only watch TP:A if there's nothing better to do or on the telly."
" A worthy sequel
",0.4404,0.9524,2020-07-04 00:00:00,8,"Much better could ever expect! Originally saw in the theater I just wasn't reviewing then, happily enjoying this glorious action/thriller with lots of great madness and creepy gestures. James DeManco's Purge films might not be appreciated much but Anarchy, Election Year and his writing for The Negotiator is so damn good! Such a great concept that is perfectly executed in this adaptation."

" Good sequel
",0.4404,0.906,2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,This film captures the idea of the purge in a perfect way. Instead of focusing on a family that stays at home during the purge like in the first one it focuses on what's going on outside on the streets. The movie pays off with creepy purgers good acting sequences and a good plot!

" Serviceable
",0.0,0.9793,2020-05-23 00:00:00,5,"I feel like this film cuts corners. So in the title is the word Anarchy and the film gives us the perfect backdrop to show us that. I expected to see carnage everywhere but I guess the budget didn't allow for it. On the characters, there aren't any above generic tropes e.g the tough guy etc. That said, it's not horrible I just feel corners are cut and there needs to be better acting. It was quite humerus seeing the NEED for night vision goggles perfectly redundant as our hero seems to know to leap a wall and take people out before getting them. I think this is a serviceable film at best."
" Great

And that's also why it's so exciting.No way that this would ever happen or even remotely be possible to work. Even if it were to work, every reasonable human being would determine that the majority is good and that it's 12 hours of mayhem and civil war that bears no resemblance to any kind of democratic rule whatsoever and must be put to a halt immediately due to its sheer unethical nature.Murder, mayhem, bullets, blood...Forget about making sense of it. The characters are relatable. We want them to survive. They cross paths by accident, finding themselves in the middle of all of it partially by choice and partially by accident.Yes, it was a fun movie to watch, with a strong ending. Impossible in reality. Suspension of disbelief reigns supreme. Good movie. Great entertainment. And don't worry, in hindsight you really do get to conclude it's all fake, but thinking comes later, watching comes first."
" Decent sequel set in a dystopian nearly future with energetic action, shootouts, extreme violence and high body-count

",0.3182,0.9894,2019-09-19 00:00:00,7,"Given the success that the Purge made in 2013, a sequel was obvious and it was made in no time just released a year later. Having enjoyed the original film for what it was but seeing its flaws and having that film feel as if it was rushed, this sequel feels bigger, better looking (nicer camera work, overall better visuals) and somewhat more intrigued.Even with a lesser known cast it doesn't matter too much since the premise of its selling is the concept. And even with that, Frank Grillo is a very solid lead choice here, along with Carmen Ejogo and the daughter portrayed good sympathetic and likeable characters.Anarchy does feel more realistic and we see more of the city and the action is just as good if not better. Where as the original was more of a home invasion film."

" Average: 5.0
",0.0,-0.826,2019-07-29 00:00:00,5,"The Purge (both Anarchy and its prequel) had so much potential. The premise was excellent, seeming ripe for making a thriller filled to the brim with commntary on classism, distribution of wealth, and the effectiveness of law enforcement. Unfortunately, writer/director James DeMonaco seems content to just go straight for the violence, and leave the messages out to dry. While the first Purge film was a relatively straightforward home-invasion movie, Anarchy is an action-thriller, with bigger scale, a bigger cast, and bigger ideas. The scale part actually works pretty well, showing how society in general reacts to twelve hours of lawlessness. And though it makes for some truly disturbing imagery, as before, the violence and gore still end up taking the stage. And that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, except that, as in the first film, DeMonaco seems to be a tad timid when it comes to showing truly horrific acts. Take out most of the obscenities, and this film would have had a chance of being PG-13. If the events depicted in Anarchy really happened, people would do far worse than just kill each other, But no, DeMonaco seems content to just stick with highly standard action and horror fare, rather than truly pushing the envelope. Which is a shame, really, because that push could have been all that was needed to help this series realize its full potential."
" Believable dialogue and believable storyline (just)
",0.0,0.7437,2019-07-14 00:00:00,8,"As has already been suggested by others, this is better than the original, The Purge (2013) and indeed makes the earlier film superfluous. It was more a home invasion film, anyway, whereas this really does grasp the mettle and run with the (however silly) original concept of mass killing for the good of all. Here though the odd notion is not only questioned as it is gleefully pursued but it is evident there are more dubious forces at work. Beautifully shot with some great night scenes and almost constant action with the story moving forward on various levels, this is a much underrated film, unfairly stuck with the poor reputation of the original. Believable dialogue and believable storyline (just)."

This does not prevent most science fiction creators today from imagining the apocalypse or post-apocalyptic worlds, societies dominated by violence or under the dictatorship of various kinds. Science-fiction has become almost synonymous with dystopia. The action movies series 'The Purge' belongs to this category. The first movie in the series came out on screen in 2013. The action of the second movie in the series, 'The Purge: Anarchy', which I saw now, made in 2014, takes place in the America of 2023. The nightmare described in the film is generated by ... elected politicians.2023. Crime has been reduced to almost zero, unemployment is lower than ever. America seems to have solved its problems of law and order. The price? One night a year, for 12 hours, crimes of any kind are legal. The wealthy are barricaded in well-guarded houses, they even organize bloody orgies in which the victims belong to the categories who can not afford shelter and defense. Criminals kill each other or exercise their thirst for violence on victims selected among those who can be found in the streets. Most of the population supports this policy, legislated by politicians and encouraged by the government. The slogan of this 'renewal'? 'America Reborn'. The film's heroes, a few people surprised by the yearly Purge on the streets, or who are thrown by circumstances in the midst of violence, will try to survive the night.James De Monaco, the creator of the series (three feature films and now also a television series) and the director of the film, wanted to create a good action thriller whose story is taking place in the near future. He has succeeded well, the story in this second film in the series has logic, editing is alert and the action scenes bind well. The actors team does not include any famous names, which has reduced costs and made the movie profitable since its first week, but all actors are well-chosen and act professionally. Beyond the pleasure of watching a well-done action movie, the idea of the movie is interesting and the questions put in the subtext are as real as possible. Can more violence solve the problem of violence? (a current question in an America where the right of every citizen to wear weapons is guaranteed by the Constitution). Can the lack of law and order, for a limited period of time, solve the endemic problem of law and order? Of course, what's happening in the movie is a metaphor, but the questions are as actual as possible. This good dystopian action movie succeeds to be more than it aimed to be."
" Decent sequel...
",0.0,0.9708,2019-01-23 00:00:00,6,"""The Purge: Anarchy"" is a Thriller - Horror movie and the sequel of ""The Purge"" in which we watch three groups of people trying to survive the purge night in Los Angeles. There is a couple whose car broke down and they have to survive by themselves during the night, a police officer who wants to take revenge for his son death and a mother with her daughter who left their home after an attack.Since I had already watched the first movie I had high hopes and expectations from this movie and I have to admit that it reached its potential. It wasn't as good as the first movie but still, I think that it was a nice movie which had an interesting plot like the first and some very good interpretations. About the direction which was made again by James DeMonaco, I believe that he did a great job for one more time and presented us a nice film. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Frank Grillo who played as Police Sergeant made a very good interpretation and Carmen Ejogo who played as Eva Sanchez made an equally good one.In conclusion, I have to say that ""The Purge: Anarchy"" is a good movie to watch, it reached its potential and despite that, it isn't as good as the first movie, it's a decent sequel to watch. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because once more I am sure that you are going to enjoy it. If you have already watched the first movie then you definitely have to watch this movie too."

The political aspects of the film, i.e. ""class warfare"" that was touched on in the first film becomes a powerful theme in this one.

" The Purge Anarchy steps outside onto city streets and lets chaos ensue.
",-0.5719,-0.5952,2018-10-09 00:00:00,7,"Forget about its predecessor which was a forgettable home invasion thriller. This sequel is a perfect example in realising a concept. ""Purging"" is an intriguing idea, one that means something different to various socioeconomic groups in America. Of course entirely fictional (at least for now...), this film illustrates the possibilities and consequences of the existence of such a law. Three groups of strangers coincidentally join together in an attempt to survive the night of the annual ""Purge"". DeMonaco fully conceptualises the ""Purge"" and thoroughly explores various backgrounds. The perspective of those in poverty who just want to survive, the view of the wealthy who pay for martyrs and specific individuals who purge for personal gains. The ""cleanse your body"" ethos that surrounds this law masquerades its true intentions of culling the population. Governmental agents sent specifically to target buildings in areas of low economic wealth. Intriguing yet intimidating. I'm just glad it only took one sequel to showcase the daunting politics of the ""Purge"". The strikingly vivid chaos ranges from dark alleyways littered with traps to quiet neighbourhoods that gradually become polluted with the piercing sound of gunfire. For some reason unbeknown to me, everyone who is purging suddenly become maniacal and insane, even going so far as to wearing masks (which is pointless if you're allowed to murder by law?). Unfortunately this aspect isn't explored as thoroughly. The acting was pretty good, particularly from Grillo who exhumes anger and rage. A few plot conveniences here and there, the most noticeable being saved at the last minute in the hunting room. Really? Seemed like a cheap way out to me. But it remains enjoyable throughout, exploring political and social commentaries that may just be apt for today's society, whilst containing plenty of violence and a few jump scares. A sequel that improves almost entirely on its predecessor. The real question is: ""would you purge?""."
" The Purge: Anarchy - Spoiler Free Review
",0.5106,-0.9552,2018-09-17 00:00:00,7,"Back in 2013 when 'The Purge' was released, I saw it and my immediate thought was simply ""Wow, this is a piece of ****"", so when I heard they were making a sequel, I did what any rational person would do and skipped it. Then last week, with two hours to burn between seeing 'The Nun' and 'The Meg' I walked into 'The First Purge'...my thoughts while sitting there was something along the line that I now literally know what castration must feel like and right there and then I called that it would be the worst film I see in 2018. But, I'm a bit of a masochist, and therefore, yesterday, I decided to watch the other Purge sequels... I'm actually in shock to be saying this, but this movie was freaking awesome! We follow three groups of characters: a couple who recently broke up and who get stuck outside when their car breaks down, a police officer out for revenge against the man who accidentally killed his son the previous year and a mother and daughter, just doing whatever they can to survive the night. Ultimately the three groups band together to survive the annual Purge. Frank Grillo stars as the police officer who becomes the leader of the group and he is simply awesome in this part. Grillo's character asks the classic question of what we would do to someone who hurt our family, and brings a true depth to this character, while still being a tough as hell and just an overall fun character. The other characters are likeable too, unlike just about everyone in 'The First Purge', these characters are all quite sympathetic and all have defining character traits that makes you want to see them survive. This alone already puts this high above the other entries I'd seen previously. The plot is handled much differently too, while the original mostly stayed in one location and ultimately just became another home invasion film, this one takes you out into the action and offers a hard look at a crumbling society. The assassins, especially those hunting the young couple, is creepy as hell. There are lots of slow moments with them kinda just standing still and staring, and these scenes are actually spine tingling. The political commentary here is done much better too, even if it more or less gives the same message as the other entries, it's better balanced and doesn't come across as just plain racist (like 'The First Purge'). Overall, you don't have to be a fan of the original to like this sequel, hell skip the original completely and start with this film, because this is purging done right."
" Bad logic
",-0.5423,-0.3291,2018-09-16 00:00:00,5,"The idea of the film is definitely good, but I think the method of directing suffers a lot of weakness.
The film discusses the human being in the industrial community, and turning it into a tool of balance and pleasure by the wealthy, and the resulting natural reaction is the inevitable revolution to realize the meaning of human existence. 
But the severity of the violence destroyed the rational and humane meaning .. the film was greatly disrupted, and this is the main reason for the low evaluation. but in general, a film remains with a good idea. It is the ultimate rebellion against ""politics, economy and enterprise ""
addition to the traditional idea of the American cinema, revenge, emotions and the triumph of lasting goodness in the end.
The film could have been a much better, but there's a lot of arbitrary and bad logic in the cinematic processing."

But I was a bit afraid watching the sequel, as sequels usually are less good. What an error! The Purge Anarchy is a good movie, one of the best thrillers I saw lately. It introduced Frank Grillo, a charismatic superhero, a character between Clint Eastwood's a d Keanu Reeves' similar roles. The brother of John Wick, for instance. He could and should play main roles in big budget revenge movies, he has the presence, the charisma and the skills to do that.
You should watch it, even if you didn't see the first part. It's one of the rare recent watchable action thrillers."
" Anarchic purge
",0.0,0.8501,2018-08-08 00:00:00,6,"Am another person who didn't care at all for 'The Purge' from 2013. It wasn't completely unwatchable with a couple of reasonable performances and decent production values but was so tension and suspense-free and full of irritating characters, illogical character behaviours, a dull pace, a cheesy script and tired clichÃ©s.Had seen and heard numerous times people saying that 'The Purge: Anarchy' was a much better film. Will admit that due to disliking 'The Purge' so much, part of me was very unsure as to whether to watch 'The Purge: Anarchy' and very nearly didn't watch it. To be fair though, decided to watch it and found it not to be a waste of time at all, it is a second film that stands well on its own and doesn't try to be more of the same and instead be different from the predecessor. Am in complete agreement with those saying that this is the far superior film, while thinking that it was still flawed and not too great.'The Purge: Anarchy' has a lot of good things. The story execution is much better this time round, it's more eventful, is tighter paced, is intriguing and has some creepy atmosphere and suspense. The acting is also better, with a formidable Frank Grillo leading the cast with aplomb.Less irritating characters here too, generally the characters are easier to relate to and are not as shallow, their behaviour also makes more sense and induces less face palms. There are unsettling moments here, some fun ones and some intriguing ones. It's assuredly directed and the slick and gritty visual look remains, its effort to be larger in scale in terms of ideas and narrative and have more going on is laudable.However, 'The Purge: Anarchy' is still heavily flawed. The dialogue is still enough to make one cringe and just sounds so fatigued, stilted and without any imagination. The social commentary and rich vs poor aspects are dealt with in a heavy-handed way and the effects are shoddy and do look fake.Character development is very flimsy and 'The Purge: Anarchy' still has a few characters that frustrate (especially the annoying Cali, with Zoe Soul giving the only ""bad"" performance), not much imaginative or surprising and the clichÃ©s every bit as tired. There are some parts that feel like they're stretched out too far, the ending doesn't finish the film with a bang as much as one would hope.Reading those criticisms, one would think that 'The Purge: Anarchy' is a bad film. Unlike 'The Purge', it is not. It's problematic and is not a great film, but overall it's decent enough and has a good deal in its favour with things that were bad previously corrected. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
" The Purge world is expanded in this more action oriented (and less horror focused) sequel
",-0.5279,-0.2456,2018-08-03 00:00:00,7,"America. 2023. Unemployment is below 5%. 
Crime is virtually non-existent while every year fewer and fewer people live below the poverty line. 
All thanks to... The Purge: Anarchy.As with the first film, ""The Purge: Anarchy"" has an irresistible set-up with one day a year where all criminal activity, including murder, is legal, all done in the name of some sort of societal catharsis that has given the nation record low unemployment and record economic growth. Just as with the first film, there's no way anyone can watch this movie without wondering what they would do during one of these horrible annual purges. Would you hunker down and protect your family and property? Would you go wild in the streets? Would you enact revenge over a petty grievance? However, also as with the first film, the story that ends up on screen is a disappointingly routine and does not live up to the film's killer premiss. The first film ended up a well done home invasion/siege film with horror tinges. This sequel opens up the world of The Purge by following a group of disparate characters who find themselves out in the open in a big city the night of a Purge. The general story is that a single mother and teen daughter find themselves out on the street after being attacked by their landlord and then nearly kidnapped by a mysterious organized forced when they're saved by a muscle car-driving Frank Grillo, who's out looking for some of his own personal revenge. Grillo also finds himself protecting another young couple who's car broke down on their way home (never mind why anyone would go to the store right before The Purge is about to begin, although this film is not the type of movie where you poke holes in logic because it's way too easy and ruins the fun). If the first film was basically a horror version of ""Assault on Precinct 13"" this sequel is a horror version of ""The Warriors,"" with our band of heroes having to bop their way through vicious roving gangs in a series of exciting incidents to survive. ""Judgement Night"" might also be an apt comparison and there's a dash of ""The Running Man"" in there too with some dystopian government conspiracy elements thrown in. This sequel delves a bit more into the subtext of The Purge by playing up the class warfare elements of the concept. One character fighting against The Purge says ""Change only comes when their blood spills"" referring to hunting down the wealthy who think their money and power can protect them from the anarchy in the streets. This widening of the world of The Purge makes it superior to the original. While the worldbuilding is interesting, most of the film is unfortunately a series of action set-pieces that end with Grillo telling everyone to ""Keep moving!"" I wish the film had contained more scenes like one where the group takes refuge in a friend's apartment in what starts as a friendly dinner party and provides them with a rare moment of calm. That's when writer/director James DeMonaco masterfully builds tension that climaxes when one of the apartment residents pulls a gun and the seemingly normal dinner party goes berserk. This scene is a microcosm of the entire world of The Purge and is wonderfully executed by DeMonaco. If only the rest of the film were this good. Still, although the story is disappointingly routine action film, it's well executed and never boring. DeMonaco fills the screen with memorably frightening visuals, whether it's the many masked killers roaming the street or a haunting image of a woman drenched in blood eerily standing motionless on a street corner, he captures glimpses a frightening world of lawless anarchy that does not seem all that far removed from our reality (if only the main story was as horrific). And I love the sirens sound effects announcing the start of The Purge are wonderfully frightening, partially because of the excellent sound design, but also because of the great build-up to the lawless purge, sounding as if they're biblical horns announcing the end of times. This sequel also has a cool cameo by a character from the first film, which connects the two seemingly disparate stories. Overall, while I still feel that the final product doesn't live up to the brilliant premiss, ""The Purge: Anarchy"" is entertaining, fast paced, and never boring. Just go into this film expecting more of an action film and less of a horror film."

Frank Grillo comes in and does an awesome job, turning the franchise away from horror and more into a straight up action thriller.

" Oh Say, can you see by the dawn's early light, all the innocent people we purged!
",0.4003,-0.9439,2018-04-28 00:00:00,6,"With ""The Purge"" in 2013, writer/director James DeMonaco introduced one of the most original and disturbingly realistic premises for a dystopian Sci-Fi/thriller flick in many years. However, for some inexplicable reason, DeMonaco took all the great potential and wasted it on making yet another mundane and run-of-the-mill slasher/vigilante thriller. Literally everyone could see that the concept of ""The Purge"" (all types of crime are legalized during a 12-hour period across the USA in a not-so-distant future) offers endless possibilities, and apparently DeMonaco realized it too in the meantime, since the first numberless sequel is better, more disturbing and a lot more varied in terms of purging types & participants. Whereas in the first film, only one wealthy family got targeted by a violent gang in their heavily secured house, there are various storylines in ""Anarchy"". Here we see how the purge is used as an excuse to extract personal vengeance, how rich families literally buy poor people to feast their murder lusts upon, how family feuds are resolved, how the government organizes a secretive sort of mass-cleansing and how street gangs (with awesome masks) chase and round up victims for pretentious snobs. That last storyline reminded me of one of the oldest cult premises in cinema history, and a personal favorite classic of mine, namely ""The Most Dangerous Game"". There's still a lot of efficient satire and social criticism in DeMonaco's script, notably regarding America's culture of violence and the pro-weapon attitude. Contrary to most horror films and thrillers nowadays, ""The Purge: Anarchy"" has a cast full of amiable and realistic characters, and the performances (Frank Grillo, ZoÃ« Soul, Kiele Sanchez...) are more than adequate."

You could feel that the first movie did not execute the brainstorming idea that was behind it, but this one, this one deserves all the glory and pushes the concept to live to it's potential. Here, the story expands, the idea expands, the producer opens our eyes to the city in the Purge night where it all happens. You can feel the fear, the agony, the momentum, the drama and all ""what if it really happened"" thoughts while watching the movie.

",0.5399,0.9386,2017-08-05 00:00:00,6,"I just watched The Purge Anarchy right after watching the first sequel made in 2013 and i was shocked by the amount of improvement. This part contains more action, some thrilling even though you can predict a lot of things but you'll enjoy it. I think i will watch The Purge Election year soon.. hope it will be better than it's precedents."
" Decent story, ugly political correctness
",-0.5106,0.9166,2017-06-29 00:00:00,2,"An interesting plot but with some generic characters - an ex-military machismo super soldier, the ""profound"" young adult, and a young couple whose car breaks down (not kidding). While the acting wasn't superb, it wasn't the worst, and definitely far from the worst for a sequel. The movie is mildly suspenseful but some of the character motivations and connections come across weak.What really takes away from it all is the obscene political correctness. The anti-purge heroes are all black, everyone bad is old and white, and everyone poor or struggling is black/latino. The purge is created to wipe out the poor (read Black) population to transfer wealth back to the top (?) What is a novel idea for a thriller, tries too hard to come out of the racial mess looking clean. Its OK to make some of the white characters poor, its OK to make some of the elitists black!"
" Ugly distortion the real & important meaning of 'anarchy'
",-0.3612,-0.9857,2017-06-03 00:00:00,2,"Only saw trailer, considering to watch it, but that was enough. In what sick world are any resources at all devoted to make this pernicious junk? Worse still to probably not even be aware that it is being used to obscure and twist the legitimate meaning of the word anarchy in the minds of the people as an important political option. Disgusting, reprehensible ignorance - I don't even care what Hollywood twist might be done in the fuller plot - the very scenario does the damage. The 'artists' who perpetrate such shameful crap should stay out of the public domain and concentrate on not being part of the problem."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",0.0,-0.9687,2017-03-26 00:00:00,8,"When I saw the trailer for the first Purge movie, I thought it was a wildly innovative idea and I absolutely loved it! I was so excited to see the film, unfortunately it amounted to little more than a slasher movie. The story had all the potential in the world, but they really didn't go into it, they just wanted to show off the violence and hatred people had towards one another. I was hoping they would correct this in the sequel and boy did they ever! Anarchy isn't about some family hunkered down in their home, fighting off attackers. In the second installment of the Purge, we learn a lot more about it. The pro and anti-purge factions that exist, the professional companies that make a fortune off that one night, the way the rich purge, and the main story which centers around what happens on the streets when two families are trapped outside on purge night. Two families are easy pickings until they find Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), a man on a mission that he can only complete on Purge night. Barnes however is a man of conscience and won't complete his mission until he begrudgingly gets the families to safety, which means a wild trek through the city. The Purge: Anarchy is a wild ride through a city of ordinary people turned into killers, with home made weapons, booby-traps, and pure anarchy, just as the title promises. If you're looking for action and violence, there are a million places to turn, that's not what the appeal of this movie is. It's the idea, that crime virtually is nonexistent, except for this one night, where society turns on each other. Where almost everyone's craziest fantasy becomes reality and just how some people react. What will each character turn into when they are allowed to do whatever they want? How does society feel about this law and is the benefit worth the cost? This story has just so many directions it can go in, that why I'm not surprised to hear they're working on a fourth film. The Purge series may just be a series of action/slasher films, but this one idea puts a whole new spin on them and makes you see things through a whole different set of eyes and I for one think it's ingenious."
" Entertaining and Dark!
",0.4926,-0.9818,2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"This film is a sequel to the film, ""The Purge,"" about a 12 hour holiday one night a year where all crimes are legal even murder in a futuristic world. Set in Los Angeles, California, there are a few people who get stranded and in trouble. Frank Grillo comes to their rescue. I saw an edited version of the film on television. They didn't show the gruesome crimes like murder especially white wealthy families killing somebody. The one scene in the mansion surrounded by plastic and people with sharp knives around him was horrifying enough for the imagination. There is also a purge auction where the bidders pay to kill their prey. Santa Barbara's Judith McConnell plays the auctioneer. It is creepy to watch them watching a real hunger games like pursuit. In only 12 hours, the Purge goes on and it's creepy in itself. Killing for sport one night a year to let people vent their frustrations. I got mad at Eva and her daughter for having lights and the television on in their apartment. You don't want to cause attention and be seen as a possible target. The Purge has its own rules and traditions which includes killing a person like a sacrifice. It's a frightening world to live in the purge. It still is entertaining."

",0.0,0.9674,2017-02-21 00:00:00,9,"This is an amazing film. It just might be my favorite horror movie of the past couple of years. The acting is overall good, for a low budget film like this one. The movie is a thrill ride from beginning to end. The characters are set up nicely and I cared about them. The villains are effective and scary. There is a interesting political view that the film gives us as we progress further into the movie. The film has a good music score from Nathan Whitehead. His score fits into the movie pretty well."
" Better than its predecessor
",0.4404,0.9793,2017-01-31 00:00:00,6,"The good thing about THE PURGE: ANARCHY is that it's a step up in terms of quality from its predecessor; the first film was just another home invasion thriller, one quite well made but let down by its own predictability. ANARCHY is still predictable, but the chase/journey narrative structure means that it's a faster-paced production as a whole, one that never becomes boring.The film's protagonist is played by Frank Grillo, a guy who never impressed me in support in the past but who does a fine job as a tough guy here. He reminded me a lot of The Punisher in terms of his dark appearance and tough-guy presence. The supporting cast are less interesting, and some of the female characters are still annoyingly weak and given to screaming at every little thing.Still, the journey through dark and violent streets is an often exciting one and there's a wealth of gritty action to enjoy. Often the action is a little too CGI-enhanced for my liking, but at least the film never slows down, building to an appropriately thrilling climax. Watch out for Michael Kenneth Williams in another weird cameo. ANARCHY manages to be creepy enough in the early scenes and exciting enough in the later ones to be an effective Hollywood thriller."
