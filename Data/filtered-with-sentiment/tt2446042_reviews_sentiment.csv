" Disturbing camerawork
",-0.5106,0.1666,2021-02-25 00:00:00,3,"I watched this movie yesterday. I don't know why I finished it, I guess boredom. One thing that's really annoying is how they zoom in on the action and cut ultrashort frames together to create a sense of adrenaline/rush. Maybe Liam is too slow, I don't know but this kind of editing to me is a coverup for not being able to shoot proper action scenes. They probably think our brain will make something useful out of it.
Definitely not worth a watch."
" Terrific visual and story
",0.4767,0.9501,2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Liam Neeson is back and better than before. He returned to his role as part of his intelligence team and this time there's more emotion and more thought into the script. Masterful editing, brilliant action and and intense storyline. The detective is particular fantastic. Ignore the criticism who say this was made by idiots and awful, it's far from and to be honest other than a few eye brow raising moments this movie is a brilliant action thriller with a very interesting character."
" Cheesy action flick with one big issue
",0.0,-0.7335,2021-02-14 00:00:00,5,"This is a cheesy action flick, but IMO the one thing that completely ruins the movie is the camera work and the cuts once every 2 seconds. It just ruins the whole watching experience. This is how NOT to make an action movie if you want the audience to actually enjoy it and want to watch it multiple times."

" ""It ends here"" thank you
",0.3612,-0.8807,2021-01-12 00:00:00,1,"Taken 3 is the worst action movie that I have seen in years, the camera between the action scenes is terrible, you just can't understand what is happening, and about the plot, awful and forgettable"
" The franchise, and Neeson, are looking a little tired.
",-0.3832,-0.9658,2021-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Liam Neeson certainly looks very convincing as a tough, hard-as-nails kinda guy. That face. That gruff, angry manner. But it's pretty clear now in Taken 3 that Neeson (in his early '60s) isn't really a great ACTION-hero anymore. The fight scenes are all done in great close up with lots of cuts...trying to hide the fact that Neeson can't move like he needs to. When his character is running from the police early in the film...we see 1 second of him running, then cut, then a shot of him from the waist up, then a longer shot of running but from behind, where a stuntman can do it for him. I have no issues with Neeson...he's been such a reliable actor for so many years. But in this film, he seems tired, and the film does a bit too.At least no one gets Taken...not really. The film is set in Los Angeles...so we've gone from the first film, set all over Europe, to the 2nd, set primarily in Istanbul to now...set in Neeson's back yard. Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is framed for murder, so of course he must escape the cops and solve the crime himself. The body count continues to be high...but it's a PG-13 film, so there's nothing too graphic. It all seems clean and almost anti-septic. These are action films for folks who like ""Matlock.""Maggie Grace is back again...still acting like a high school girl (although I guess she's in college now), even though the actress is north of 30. She just isn't pulling it off. Her character is quite annoying...seemingly incapable of making ordinary life decisions. Her dad tells her it might be too hard for her to own a puppy, for goodness sake. That's how little confidence he has in her!! Famke Janssen returns as Mills' ex-wife, but her character continues to be underwritten. It's clear she's made a mistake divorcing Mills. That's the only thing her character ever seems to do...make us realize these two really belong together.Early on, the plot actually takes a surprising turn (shocker!)...but for the most part, this is pretty cookie cutter. Again, bullets never hit Neeson, and he seldom misses. You just never really feel like he's in peril. The film generates the least tension of the 3. Although there's nothing incompetent about it, really...it's just not particularly good in any given area either. I give it three stars because it is diverting...but that's the best you can say. If you're looking for an action film...I suggest you keep looking. Any DIE HARD film (except the last one) is better."
" A mixture of familiar tropes that ultimately turns out to be a mediocre action flick
",0.0,0.365,2020-11-11 00:00:00,4,"The third and final Taken movie does feel like an improvement in comparison with the laughable second part of the trilogy, but it is still plagued by many of the same problems that had come to light in the previous two installments, ultimately turning out to be just another mediocre action flick.The plot does succeed in being more interesting than the one in the second movie, but it generally feels all too familiar to come anywhere near the relative originality of the basic idea that had started the franchise. As far as its credibility is concerned, it goes without saying that a believable story is not something that one should expect from any of the three Taken movies.This time, Liam Neeson's character, a former CIA agent named Bryan Mills, discovers that his ex-wife Lenore was murdered in his apartment and quickly finds himself running away from hundreds of police officers as the prime suspect. His methods of escaping the chasers become increasingly unrealistic, allowing him to emerge unscathed from two car crashes that are immediately followed by massive explosions. Finally, he prevents a private jet from taking off by driving a Porsche 911 into it at high speed.With all the Albanian mobsters killed in the first two movies, the murder of Lenore eventually turns out to be the work of her new husband Stuart and a bunch of Russian rowdies. Of course, the villains make for a group of stereotypical and bland figures, ultimately giving me the impression that I have seen them in dozens of other films. The police officers and detectives are just as unoriginal. One of the detectives, Garcia, turns out to be comically similar to the character played by Gary Oldman in Léon, thus serving as the embodiment of Luc Besson's total lack of interest in developing the characters.Although the performances do appear to be much better than the ones in the second movie, they eventually prove to be rather unspectacular. Forest Whitaker does try his best as the leading detective and his performance turns out to be quite good. On the other hand, Dougray Scott is abysmal as Stuart, with his character being just as comical as the Russian ones.There are many chase and fight sequences, but not one of them turns out to be particularly exciting. Furthermore, a lot of camera shaking makes for a pretty lame stylistic device. Even though Taken 3 does appear to be at a higher stylistic level than Taken 2, it is still rather unremarkable in terms of its visual appearance, with many of its action sequences turning out to be nothing more than re-creations of various ideas from a handful of action blockbusters and crime series that were released over the last two decades."
" A heaping load of crap
",-0.3818,-0.9922,2020-10-11 00:00:00,1,"Is it too much to ask that a movie involving humans make any sense?Bryan Mills (Neeson, who was 62 years old when this was made) has been framed for a murder. He doesn't like that. It could mean a life sentence, I suppose. So what does he do?
1) Mills happens upon and lingers too long at the crime scene, so (as Megaton required) the cops can confront him. Mills supposedly overcomes two highly trained police officers with guns aimed on him, and surprises and beats the two cops unconscious, so that he can escape out the window. Yay! I wonder what the court sentence for that little piece of mischief might be?
2) Mills drops out the window about 30 feet bouncing off a lidded dumpster. No injury whatsoever. Remember, 62 years old. Unscathed.
3) It's not close to a clean escape. Cops are swarming and squad cars are everywhere. Mills gets into an extended footrace with an obviously in shape cop looking about 25 yrs old. It is easily seen that Neeson can hardly run; he's OLD for goshsakes! His full run oldster strides are laughable. But, this old man somehow keeps his young pursuer at bay, even though in every shot, the younger man gets through every obstacle, climbing fences, jumping walls, etc.
much faster than Mills. Again, fleeing like this is a crime.
4) Mills enters a random house, runs past some people having dinner, and finally enters the garage, with the cops in close pursuit. He ducks under a car and, as luck would have it, there are loose boards there that he lifts up, miraculously exposing a chute to a river underneath the garage! So he drops into the chute, after somehow replacing the boards with no footholds whatsoever. The police arrive about one second later and are baffled. Breaking and entering is a yet another crime.
5) At some point Mills gets captured. While being taken to jail in a huge police convoy, of course he overcomes his captors, and while forcing the hands of the cop who is driving, he causes huge crashes, endangering the lives of police officers, civilians, and possibly killing multiple individuals. Tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars of property damage. I'm pretty sure that's a staggering list of crimes.I kinda lost interest after that and start cleaning around the house, so I can't give you much more other than Mills kicked ass on the Russian bad guys in completely unrealistic ways, at one point holding one up to shield himself against the hail of bullets from a machine gun, dropping a chandelier onto his enemy with one bullet while not looking because he was hiding behind a corner...And the stupidity goes on and on and on.Watch this at your own risk. It's a personal insult to each and every viewer.Oh, wait. At the end the policeman (Forest Whittaker) in charge of the investigation/capture of Mills just shakes Mills hand let's him walk away! Like it's all good!Shall we count the crimes Mills committed trying to prove his innocence?"
" My recommendation
",0.0,-0.5318,2020-09-24 00:00:00,7,"As the title suggests..Bryan Mills still have his ""particular set of skills""..only this time he use them for personal reasons......seriously..i've watched countless movies wich have had sequels,interquels,prequels and such..and this movie aint any different. Story is predictible (but decent) acting is exellent (even though i've never liked Famke Jannson),and we get to see the main caracter do what he/she do best...wich should be the main (if not only) reason to to watch this..way to low ratings (possibly due to high expectations,but i dont know)..my
recommendation: watch it for what it is...entertainment (as all movies are supposed to be)..."
" Weakest in the franchise
",-0.5106,-0.4973,2020-08-30 00:00:00,6,"For me, this part was weakest one in this franchise. First of all, whenever there is murder the suspense must be good which was not in this part. The story was also very old fashioned. Liam Neeson's acting was not good as compared to previous parts. There were very less action scenes, which are needed in this type of film. Overall, you may enjoy the film but it may not satisfy you."
" Garbage
",0.0,-0.6124,2020-08-29 00:00:00,1,"Absolute dumpster-fire of an action movie and a complete waste of Liam Neeson's talents. Olivier Megaton should be banned from movie-making, his films are headache-inducing trash with no redeeming qualities."

The rest of the movie has Bryan trying to figure out who killed his wife (even though you will know who killed Lenore in the first half of the movie). The plot is a cliche and the villain is one-dimensional. I would recommend that you avoid watching this movie."
" Good end to the trilogy
",0.4404,0.9822,2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"Really great film with a great story, good to see Liam Neeson not being able to save everyone in this action packed thriller, really good story line with a cat and mouse story with Liam trying to clear his name. Forrest Whitaker plays a great cop as well."

" Utterly pointless
",0.0,-0.9777,2020-03-29 00:00:00,3,The Taken series go from bad to worst with the third film being even more forced than the second.Taken 3 sees Bryan Mills getting framed for murder and has to go on the run whilst trying to prove his innocence. So it is basically The Fugitive made by hacks.Olivier Megaton is one of the worst action directors currently working in mainstream cinema and proven by his work on the Taken films. His approach for Taken 3 was to make a third rate Bourne knockoff and having his action sequence edited to hell. He doesn't even include anything as incredibly hilarious and stupid as Kim throwing grenades in Istanbul.Even though Taken 2 was a forced sequel at least it tried to be connected to the first film. Taken 3 had a stock plot that could have been applied to any film. So it can't even satisfy a completist or fan of the previous film (and they have properly seen the film already).This was a film that was only made for the money and give everyone involved a nice paycheck.
" Disappointed
",-0.4767,-0.8712,2020-03-29 00:00:00,6,"Disappointed. It felt low budget, the car chases were shot so all you could see were tires, quick shots of the cars with jerky camera work. One scene where Liam was escaping the police he caused a trailer to flip end over end crushing several cars on the freeway. Am I to believe Liams character would have killed or injured these innocent people just to escape police custody? There's more scenes like that, it just doesn't add up. The writers and director let the actors and viewers down with this dud"
" What a great film!
",0.6588,0.9623,2020-03-16 00:00:00,5,"I personally think this is a great film. The action sequences, they say dull, are personally thrilling and Neeson acts awesome as well. 8/10 stars. Again, great blockbuster movie"
" Hugely entertaining action romp
",0.4927,0.9681,2020-02-27 00:00:00,9,"The secret to some of these high profile movies such as Taken 3 and the reason they work so well is the casting. From the tall and surprisingly lean Liam Neeson with his gungho mates and perceptive daughter, to the exquisitely evil bad guys, and even regarding the highly intelligent cop Forest Whittaker, all are perfect matches for the characters they play. There's some interesting colloquial details too, from hot bagels to a chess piece. It's the action that's supreme however, with Liam hurtling over fences and roofs, blowing up carparks and causing mayhem on the freeway that is priceless. Some great race the clock sequences and the odd twist as well. I took a point off for the script's dance around the fact of a divorce, and remarriage, and yet Liam still comes up the favourite rose in the x's eyes. I just didn't believe it. Taken 3 is in the top tier of recent action movies in my book, and certainly another example of wonderful action movies featuring Liam Neeson in recent times."
" Taken

The plot of this film is basically the plot of The Fugitive. This film is so bad it's good and that's why I give this film 6/10."

" Brian Mills Has Ran Its Course
",0.0,-0.6093,2019-10-16 00:00:00,6,"Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen, and Maggie Rose comes back one more time for another movie in the Taken franchise known as ""Taken 3"".They co-star with Forest Whitaker and Dougray Scott as the LAPD Detective and Brian Mill's ex-wife Lennie's present husband respectively. In it,we get to see how Lennie was killed and how Brian Mills and the LAPD goes into a race as to who will solve the case first. Apparently,Brian had to solve the case himself after he became the primary suspect in the case. As expected,we know that the least suspicious character in the movie is ultimately the most guilty one.The movie evidently had a lot of action scenes that were interesting and entertaining as they are either highly implausible and extremely unrealistic. In fact,there were action sequences wherein Brian has become somewhat a superhero in evading accidents and death. We also get to see how Brian is able to beat the LAPD department in solving the case and capturing the guilty criminal who is responsible for Lennie's death.As we see this movie,it was clear that the character of Brian Mills has ran its course. Good thing that they ended the franchise here. If another film was made,it would definitely be a disaster."
" This is not a 'Taken' story
",0.0,-0.1531,2019-10-09 00:00:00,5,"The director either rushed this, or he did not focus on the theme. The meaning of Taken according to books about this film series, and the series themselves movies 1 and 2 means that a person or person(s) are kidnapped for trafficking. In this film, a business deal goes awry and causes an organized group of hitmen whom are ex-military to attack the family of the main character in the storyline.The plot of Taken 3, brings this rating up from 3 to 5 stars in that it had a very realistic story which could actually happen today if things go awry with a business deal effecting mercenaries from an ex military group, Russian Spetsnaz.Therefore I would like to give this a 5 out of 10 stars, and think it should have been named a title based on criminality in money transactions. This was a Spetsnaz movie, and not a trafficking taken movie."

" Before Watching: Taken 3 (2014)
",0.0,0.4872,2019-07-18 00:00:00,6,"""Taken 3"" (2014) is the third and last installment of the Taken-franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Much of what should be anticipated of Taken 3 can be estimated from Taken 2. If you liked that movie, you might like this one. If you didn't, you will not. Taken 3's plot does not derive any of its content from the previous two movies, but has its own storyline in a spin-off like style. The tone is less of a hitman-movie, but more of a crime thriller/spy movie. The plot gets pretty complex as it goes on, but is still decently constructed as a whole. It does require attention.Unfortunately, the fallacies are more prevalent as well as more frequently occurring compared to Taken 2 and especially Taken. Some plot devices do feel very cheap and the characters feels flat and one-dimensional. If you are however looking merely for cheap entertainment, these flaws will not be as bothersome.The severity of the violence lies a notch above Taken 2 in intensity, but still with a big step until Taken. A bit more blood is prevalent, and some deaths might be quite upsetting. All in all, Taken 3 does not feel like a subtraction to the Taken-franchise, but it is certainly not a strong addition either. It just is.My personal grade: a meagre 6/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

The daughter, father and mother had all been taken. Who's next? The family car? The pet goldfish? The last slice of bread in the kitchen? Nope. Bryan Mills' innocence. Not nearly as exciting as the slice of bread, right? Well, that's the general feeling this film exudes. That, and the consistent explosive wave of stupidity that looms over this family. Urgh. Mummy Mills comes over Daddy Mills' place for bagels but winds up dead (lucky Janssen...), to which the latter is framed for murder. He must find out who actually committed the crime before the police take him down. I don't know what's more sad.The fact that this series actually has a third instalment, or the fact that they never got to eat those fresh warm bagels. Aside from the odd scene that strangely captivated me with its butchered script, particularly between Bryan and Kim, there's nothing to recommend here. Megaton is back in mega fashion to ensure that the infrequent action sequences and overall direction have more jump cuts than a skipping rope competition. Neeson climbing over that infamous fence had approximately twelve jump cuts in three seconds. That's just insane! My eyes were staring blankly at the screen for the most part.Cars explode upon touch. No one can drive. And gosh darn it, Whitaker's character (with his elastic band fetish) devoured fresh bagels without Neeson. Rude! Fight scenes were cumbersome. The passage of time wasnseemingly lost in this story, I mean at one point we're on an idyllic beach for some obligatory waterboarding. Oh, and the mandatory phone call! This time, Bryan telling his daughter that her mum is dead. On the frickin' phone! C'mon. That is not the Bryan Mills from the first Taken who massaged his daughter's feelings. This is an enraged, insensitive and hungry Mills. Hungry for some bagels! It finalises in a shootout with a Russian in his unflattering pants, and for the life of me I have no idea why.This cash grab of a sequel marks an almighty low point in Neeson's filmography. No fault of his own though, as he is as watchable as ever (despite the carefree performance). But damn, this film just does not need to exist. Heck, its predecessor didn't either! Predictable, pointless and painfully nauseating. Atleast it isn't damaging European tourism this time. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have some bagels and forget about this film once again..."

" Liam Neeson saves this movie from a plot that is unbelievably messy.
",-0.4201,-0.9367,2019-05-13 00:00:00,5,"Bryan Mills is back for the final time and this installment could have been the epic conclusion to the Taken Trilogy, but after starting off promising with an interesting new meaning to the word ""taken"", it falls flat on it's stupid face.Lenore being murdered was a great idea as it takes the film's title and puts it in a new context. Bryan Mills has had his wife ""taken"" from him, within death. Then you get to the rest of the movie, which is really messily done, the camera angles are really odd, the fight scenes are hard to follow (The Bourne movies did it better, just saying.) but at least all the dynamics between Bryan and his daughter Kim are really nice to see.Forrest Whittaker is introduced in this movie and he always delivers. His chemistry with Liam Neeson is fantastic. But the thing that really lets this film down is the twist reveal that it was actually Kim's step-dad now played by Dougray Scott that killed Lenore... that is completely stupid. It's like his character is so inconsistent with the character they established in the first movie, who has nothing against Bryan, but in this one, he hates him for no good reason. Messed up and stupid.This movie was a disappointing ending to the trilogy that in the end felt rushed, messy, dull and inconsistent with the first two. Maybe just the one film was all it had to be in the end, even the rebooted TV show failed. But on the whole, Liam Neeson really makes these movies entertaining.

" the most extreme action of the 3 sequels, with so much stunts

Although few seconds are so extreme to be considered unreal or scifi, it is so short that it did not damage movie genre's reputation. This sequel is with more action than 1st & 2nd, but less brutal and cold than 2nd. Meaning it just has all the elements to be considered better than 2nd (which is too brutal and cold), but difficult to decide is it better than 1st. There are at least 3 good actors I recognized from other good movies I liked like from Transporter and few others. This is about extreme father-daughter relationship, the father who would do anything for his daughter, just the most extreme of the 3. Liked the stunts! Somewhat similar to Commuter (2018) movie."
" The worst in the franchise
",-0.6249,-0.9554,2019-02-25 00:00:00,3,"This review contain spoilers.Taken 3 premiered in 2014 and is the sequel to Taken 2. The movie is directed by Olivier Megaton and written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. The movie stars Liam Neeson in the leading role once again with Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace reposing their supporting roles. Bryan is setup for a crime and Bryan must evade law enforcement and clear his name.Taken 3 is a mess of a movie. Despite most of the production returning, the movie feels much worse in quality than the last movie. The second movie was already suffering from problems in the plot. This was made much worse in the third installment. So many plot points feel incredibly contrived and implausible. This hurt so much of the movie that it became laughable to watch. I could not believe much of the insanity put on display here. Bryan Mills became superhuman in his ability to predict human actions. Somehow he is able to get his daughter to one specific location with a special drink. The police are also given the motivation to hunt Bryan Mills even when it seemed implausible. The movie is filled with these writing contrivances that make
it difficult to enjoy the movie.The editing and direction are terrible in this movie. Olivier Megaton should have improved from the second film but this is not the case. The action has gotten much worse as the movie relies too much on quick cuts. These cuts made it hard to follow the action that is really not that impressive. The movie is a hollow shell of its much better early installments. I wish I that the action was directed in a more competent manner, but it is not. The movie could have easily redeemed itself to be watchable this way.Taken 3 destroys it's earlier legacy. Bryan Mills becomes a joke in this movie where his hyper-competency is so exaggerated that it resembles a parody of the earlier movies. This was entertaining at first but became tiresome as the movie went on. Even Lenore's death is not handled with much tact other than to contrive a reason for Bryan to be hunted. This is one of the worst reasons to have a character die. The movie tries to wrap up the series but it feels incredibly forced.I highly recommend not watching 'Taken 3.'Grade: F"

" Very thrilling and violent picture with a sensational Liam Neeson as relentless avenger father
",-0.1458,-0.9607,2019-01-17 00:00:00,6,"Spectacular and moving following starred by the retired CIA operative Mills (Liam Neeson) with plenty of action-packed , thrills , suspense , violence and high body-count . This is a nice sequel released six years after the first , here Liam Neeson returns as ex-covert operative Bryan Mills, whose long awaited reconciliation with his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen married to financer Stuart St. John : Dougray Scott ) is tragically cut short when she is brutally murdered . Consumed with rage, and framed for the crime, he goes on the run to evade the relentless pursuit of the CIA, FBI and the police (law enforcement : Forest Whitaker , Don Harvey , Dylan Bruno) . For one last time, Mills must use his ""particular set of skills,"" to track down the real killers, exact his unique brand of justice, and protect the only thing that matters to him now - his daughter. Meanwhile , his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is pregnant and really affected for the killing . Shortly after , Mills is rescuing his daughter from the vicious killers . Then , Bryan enlists his daughter to help him and attempts to clear his name and he swears revenge and retaliation against the murdererers . He confronts his nasty enemies in order to find it out and is forced to once again take up violent means to survive . Mills takes the law on his own hands and acting as a merciless revenger . As he faces off a feared villian called Oleg Malinkov (Sam Spruell) , an ex-soldier who was in the Russian army when they invaded Afghanistan . First, they took his daughter. Now, they're coming for him. It Ends Here. They want revenge, They chose the wrong guy. This time, they come for him.
Nail-biting and extremely violent film with a phenomenal Liam Neeson as an implacable avenger daddy .This stirring film contains intrigue , thrills, chills, frenetic action, shootouts , long run time car pursuits , car crashes , and violent fights . From start to finish the noisy action and fast movement are unstopped . Liam Neeson acting as hard-rock , two-fisted retired agent is top-notch , doing all his own fight sequences for the movie , he is the wronged father who must lay his life on the line to protect his intimate family against time and an army of ominous Russian mobsters . Being well accompanied by Maggie Grace as daughter and Famke Janssen in a brief acting as his ex-wife , repeating efficiently their previous roles . Secondary cast is frankly good, such as : Forest Whitaker , Dougray Scott , Sam Spruell , Don Harvey ,David Warshofsky , Jon Gries , and Leland Orser , among others . Nice cinematography by cameraman Eric Kress , using Steadicam and zooms with numerous locations from Los Angeles . The musician Nathaniel Mechaly creates a thrilling , moving soundtrack fitting to frantic action . Lavishly produced by the successful French producer and director Luc Besson from his production company Eurocorps . The trilogy is formed by ¨Taken 1¨ (2008) by Pierre Morel with Maggie Grace , Xander Berkeley , Holy Valance , Katie Cassidy ; in which a gang of human traffickers abduct Kim who barely has time to call her dad and give him information about an Albanese kidnapper and then Bryan seeks vendetta . ¨Taken 2¨ (2012) by Oliver Megathon with D.B. Sweeney ,Luke Grimes , Jon Gries , Rade Serbedzija , set in Istanbul in which Bryan and Lenore are abducted by the Albanian father of a kidnapper Mills killed while rescuing his daughter. And this final ""Taken 3"" movie in the trilogy, at least this is what is expected at the time of production and release . This trilogy was shot as an R-rated film, but edited down to a PG-13 for its theatrical reléase .The flick was compellingly directed by Oliver Meghaton who had previously directed other nice action films, such as ¨Taken 2¨, ¨Transporter 3¨ with Jason Statham , ¨The red siren¨ with Asia Argento and ¨Colombiana¨ with Zoe Saldana , also produced by Luc Besson . Megaton was formerly a graffiti artist and took his name from his birthday : the 6th of August 1965 is the 20th anniversary of the dropping of the Hiroshima A-bomb . Rating : 6.5/10 . Better than average sequel , well worth seeing . The picture will appeal to explosive action fans and Liam Neeson fans ."

What makes nr 3 special is the good acting performance by Forrest Whitaker and the frenetic, full blown action style by director Olivier Megaton.Taken 3 is the best of the series, with a gory bad guy and terrific action."
" An Emotive Action Thriller
",0.1027,-0.681,2019-01-15 00:00:00,8,"25 January 2015. Taken 3 has some resemblance to The Bourne Supremacy (2004). What makes this movie more than the usual action thriller is the lasting emotional torment of death of a close one. The chase scenes are both action-packed and intriguing but at the same time designed to avoid the technical difficulty of realism. The other problem with this movie is its descent into the more stereotypical good and bad guy motif making the rampage much more black and white, minimizing the cerebral ethical dilemma and the fighting scenes don't quite of the crispness of earlier Taken movies. Of note, Forrest Whitaker gets a nice role with law enforcement actually presented in much more intelligent terms than usual. So for as much that typically the same, there is also the enhancements in script that makes this movie above average. This third movie of the Taken series, if not better than, is at least equal to the quality of its predecessors."
" An easy spot of the culprit in this mindless mayhem
",-0.1217,-0.9485,2019-01-07 00:00:00,3,"""Taken 3"" joins a long list of the modern generation of almost constant action films. These simple plot films amount to little more than 90 minutes or so of mayhem. The script is so weak that I could guess the main culprit a few minutes into this film. There is so little new in any of these modern mayhem movies. Hollywood seems to stamp them out for a segment of the public that apparently thrives on portrayals of violence and destruction.When quality actors such as Liam Neeson stoop to doing these mindless, no-talent-required types of films, it says something about the condition of Hollywood. There are so few dramas, quality mysteries, comedies and other good stories for movie making into the 21st century. And, apparently a shortage of talented writers to create quality works. One wonders if society isn't beginning to morph into some sort of zombies from watching this stuff.The only challenge one can see in these films is an apparent effort to outdo other films in the frequency, variety and volume of accidents, killings, and destruction. In this film, the CGI of the freeway collisions is so obvious that it borders on poorly made sci-fi. And the acting? What acting? The mayhem doesn't slow down enough for anyone to do any acting. What little there is of it is poor at best. That goes for Neeson and everyone. Even Forest Whitaker, who has some deliberate moments on the screen, seems wooden and canned.Why did I bother to sit through this film to the end. Well, I bought it by mistake out of a store discount bin. I thought I was buying the original ""Taken."" I had seen it in the theater when it came out in 2008. At the big discount price, I thought I'd watch it again. This second sequel is so poor that I don't think I'll bother to watch ""Taken 2."" This series seems to be going the way of the vast majority of movies that have sequels made. The first sequel - second edition, is much less of a film than the original. After that, further sequels drop fast in quality and audience favor.I would note that the PG-13 rating for films like this speaks a lot about the changing mindset of society. And, Hollywood is doing its part to help us become more and more attuned to violence, and even tolerant of it."
" Seriously, another one?!
",-0.2481,-0.6367,2019-01-06 00:00:00,2,"Seriously, another one?! The first Taken was entertaining but quite unoriginal and predictable. Despite this lack of originality, we got Taken 2, with pretty much the same plot. Now we have Taken 3, with the same plot.Who the hell keeps watching this crap that they keep making sequels?Make it stop. Please."
" Good Thriller !
",0.5562,0.9793,2019-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Once again I am wondering for low ratings to such good thriller 'Taken 3 'as the movie is watchable . I agreed that there are some unrealistic situations as one can't trust, but thrill, tension and suspense are major part of the movie and will carry you within high voltage voyage of breathe holding actions. Moreover there are also one or two twists at the end. As me Taken is best, Taken 2 is average and Taken 3 is good. It is also appreciable thing that the main actor Liam Nelson is doing all his stunts own. Technology war is playing a big role in the movie. Intelligent hero with intelligent cops and clever villain are entertaining you till last. Leave aside unbelievable situations and enjoy thrill only you will definitely got a good movie not disappointing you.
Firstly I though there is a link of first two parts (Albanian brothers), but later found this is alike from it and we can hop that for Taken 4 to complete Albanian brothers revenge story.
I recommend for thrill & suspense. Go and watch. Not consider low ratings."

" ""Taken Out.""
",0.0,-0.9873,2018-12-11 00:00:00,1,"The third installment in the Taken franchise was a mistake. It's a bloated thriller film that attempts a different style to the usual premise but fails to otherwise convince audiences to find enjoyment. In this story, the protagonist of the previous films is challenged to prove his innocence upon the mysterious murder of his former spouse. But he's also tasked to uncover the true murderer, those potentially connected, and either evade or fight his way through hordes of hunters.It was a seemingly intriguing idea that was ruined by horrific pacing, ridiculous editing, recycled occurrences, humdrum outcomes, expendable villains, and weak storytelling. It's a boring thriller that wastes time being a tedious drama than an action film the series was known for. Even with some middling character development, if viewers are familiar with the film's predecessors, it's not enough to redeem its deeply flawed experience.It's the final Taken film with innovation taken out."
" I'M GOING OFF THE GRID
",0.0,-0.9585,2018-11-26 00:00:00,6,"They didn't remake the same film again, but used the same characters. I am not sure who was ""taken"" in this one. Now after the second film, I thought Bryan (Liam Neeson) and Lenore (Famke Janssen) were a sure thing to get back together, but apparently he didn't get so much as ""thank you"" nookie from it. What does a guy got to do? She is still with the guy we hate (Dougray Scott).In this film Bryan is accused of murder and must go after the real killers while the LAPD led by Forest Whitaker are hot on his tail. Oh yea, the Russians are involved too, which are more formidable than Albanians in LA. I wasn't sure why Kim (Maggie Grace) would say ""Dad is predictable,"" apparently she was in a coma for the first two features. Unfortunately the film is like a combination of Colombo and Scooby-Doo. There are not enough suspects developed to make it overly interesting, and the entertainment is watching all the collateral damage caused by Liam only to be later ignored by the LAPD. We have digressed to car chase scenes and car crashes for excitement.This was not a great script. I think most fans of the series could have come up with something better. Admittedly I was bit disappointed, yet still entertained. It was like kissing your sister.Guide: 1 f-bomb with Russian accent. No sex or nudity."

And what was the point of finding the one responsible for his ex's murder (with the price of his friend's life), only for letting him go with just a warning?Next time you wanna hire all those actors and spend all that money, call me and I would write a much, much better story for you.

" Well Made Very Solid Sequel That Delivers!
",0.5081,0.9514,2018-10-22 00:00:00,7,"OK, let's get the negatives away straight off, if you have seen the original and the sequel that was kind of a remake, you know what to expect. The movie producers need to keep to the basic ""Taken"" framework and tag on a plot that has new elements while retaining the core of the series. Sequels are really mostly just for fans anyway, and Liam Neeson does action as well as anyone since Clint Eastwood years ago, so this movie appeals to fans Of the ""Taken"" franchise and to those who follow Neeson's action career. So to judge films like ""Taken 3"" on any level other than as a entertaining action shoot em up is pointless and just silly. On the level of a action sequel this film delivers the goods it is none stop from the start with all the high end goodies of thrilling car chases, last gasp escapes, riveting shoot-em' up's all wrapped up in a glossy stylised soup, that while providing nothing new, is still very entertaining for action film fan's. Pretension and all the pseudo intellectual pretense we leave to the Oscar voters, film fan's often just want a empty shallow piece of entertainment and escapism that delivers the good's. ""Taken 3"" succeeds very well in its goals, call it a guilty pleasure but i enjoyed this second ( Cinema First) viewing very much.

Also the plot is just a bad version of the fugitive, also THIS DID NOT HAVE TO EXIST, HE HAD A ROCK SOLID ALABI. Actually. If he had just gone with the cops that tried to arrest him at his house they would have found out that he was getting bagels when his wife was murdered.

Brian showed little to no emotion over the death of his wife, which for me was very disappointing. Liam Neeson gives another awesome performance as Mills but for me i could tell he kind of looked bored throughout the movie. He didn't really give much else to Brian that he has already done; which for me was disappointing.Personally this film wasn't bad its just i would have liked to see more emotion towards the death of Lorrie.

" The worst movie I have every seen
",-0.6249,-0.2158,2018-02-22 00:00:00,2,"Although I've watched ""Did You Hear About the Morgans"" and ""The Room"", Taken 3 is the upmost worst movie I've ever seen. Worst of all, I paid for it.
I am not really sure, but I think it had to be a PG13 screening. There was no blood whatsoever. First scene - someone gets knive slaughtered in the bedroom. Sheets clean, floor clean, even the freaking knive was clean as like it just came out of the dishwasher. This no-blood-technique goes on. People die during that movie out of nothing, they just seem to fall asleep or jump against walls and then fall asleep.
There was one hilariously stupid scene, in which the main character looked at his 1980'-like cell phone to see a map with GPS coordinates on where his daughter is right now. Wow. Wow. This was so up-to-date. If 1977's Star Wars wanted to be as up-to-date as Taken 3, the space ships would had been built of wood. Graphics and movement remind me of the 1980's Pac-man game.
I know this is a movie, but Liam Neeson seemed to be god-like and kind of supernatural - waaay too much in my opinion.
I really enjoyed Taken I. Taken II was a waste of time, but Taken III - just don't watch it, don't pay for it, don't buy dvds, blurays, don't waste your time.BTW If you are a fan of Family Guy, you should watch this Taken spoof episode - Family Guy - Leggo My Meg-O 2012."

However, Taken 3 I find an extremely distracting film. The editing is so shockingly poor that I could barely make out what was going on.

" Good thing the series ended here
",0.4404,-0.9921,2018-01-30 00:00:00,2,"Moderately enjoyed the first 'Taken', while finding a fair share of faults, finding it overall an above average film that could have done more with promising potential. Was underwhelmed by 'Taken 2', which had good things but was essentially a very tired and even more ridiculous rehash with lazy stereotypes and a lack of suspense.Was worried that 'Taken 3' would be a sequel too far and that it wasn't needed, even if it still had enough to make it semi-watchable. Seeing it, 'Taken 3' not only was not necessary, even if not quite among the worst sequels ever (definitely to me one of the most pointless), and indicative of that it was a good thing it was the last 'Taken' film (from my underwhelming) but it also has very little to recommend it. It makes all the mistakes pretty much of 'Taken 2' and amplifies them and makes more on the way. The only halfway decent thing about 'Taken 3' is Liam Neeson, who at least tries and is charismatic and brooding enough. Even though one can tell still that even he knew that the film was not good and shouldn't have been made. The rest of the cast are all indifferent and are not engaging at all. They are saddled with characters that don't even have enough to them to be half-formed and are again lazy stereotypes. Direction is complete and utter chaos, and one misses the rawness and slickness of the previous two films visually. 'Taken 3' looks as though it was made on the cheap, especially with some of the worst editing seen in recent memory, editing that gave me a headache which is not good for my epilepsy. The script is filled to the brim with cheese, ham and confusion.Even the action is a failure, it is chaotically edited and photographed, gratuitously violent, unexciting and go well overboard on the ridiculousness. The pace is generally far too rushed, especially in the latter stages which affects the coherence of the story. Speaking of the story, that was one of the film's biggest issues, it may not be as much of a rehash but it is still even more fatigued than 'Taken 2' (which was as tired as it comes), even more far-fetched, even less suspenseful and thrilling and makes the further mistake of being incoherent.On the whole, very poor and that it was the last of the series was something of a relief. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

",-0.5023,-0.9931,2017-12-07 00:00:00,6,"After all the excitement of the first two films one might think the Bryon Mills and those close to him deserved a break but inevitably they are caught up in further mayhem. Bryon's ex-wife is murdered in his apartment and moments after he finds her the police arrive and assume he is the killer. Bryon manages to escape from their custody and sets about finding the real killers. The police are one step behind him and as he closes in on the killers he finds himself targeted by them too if that wasn't enough he is concerned that they may also target his daughter.If you just want lots of mindless action then you could do a lot worse than this; there are numerous fight scenes, shootouts, car chases and explosions. Despite that there isn't the sense of threat that one might expect Bryon gets out of apparently unsurvivable incidents more than once; at one point he crashes his car down an elevator shaft and somehow survives. There are some twists which aren't bad. The ending is a little cliché Mills may have proved his innocence in the murder of his wife but would he really be allowed to walk free after kidnapping police officers and causing serious, possibly fatal, mayhem on the freeway?! The silliness is somewhat salvaged by Liam Neeson's fine performance as Mills. The rest of the cast is solid enough. Overall this isn't a must see but if you want some brain in neutral action you could do worse."
" HOw to say Don't waste a minute in 5 lines
",0.3252,-0.4412,2017-09-07 00:00:00,3,"don't waste a minute watching beyond insulting even for a ""popcorn"" flick Seriously missed the mark - it almost made the Cop a bad guy for being so stupid - ""let the system decide"" omg please please watch the first one and maybe even the second but I watched the 3rd install in 15 minutes - and missed nothing - oh and yes I love Liam movies"
" slow in parts, entertaining overall
",0.4404,0.3972,2017-08-28 00:00:00,6,"The movie drags in certain parts, and many of the violent scenes are unrealistic, but it is an entertaining flick overall, so I awarded 7. I find Forest Whitaker to be VERY hard to take, with his weird wandering eye! Simply cannot get used to this; it is a major distraction to every part he plays. He is the actor chosen, unhappily, to portray Idi Amin in the movie bio. Very distracting! Liam Neeson was his usual self, though looking a bit raggy and haggard. There were some lapses in the actions of the character he plays in this film, but what the heck! It's Hollywood! Go with the flow and relax!"
" Plot had Great Potential, Fails to Deliver,
",0.3182,0.9447,2017-08-08 00:00:00,5,"Taken 3 is a mediocre movie with an average plot and a cast that look more inspired to get their pay check than to be in this. It certainly has its moments, there are some stellar action sequences and some really tense scenes that make for a pleasant viewing that is certainly not boring. It is a pleasure as always to see Liam Nesson naturally slip back in to Bryan Mills' shoes, he has a very effortless screen presence. When I first saw the trailer, I was delighted to see this movie taking a different approach and doing something very unlike the last two films. However, this plot is in no way as engaging or gripping as the previous two, it was a lot more predictable and felt like any other action. While the first Taken was breaking boundaries, this movie played it safe.There is also some very cringe worthy dialogue throughout that took me out of it on a regular basis. No matter how absurd the characters situation is, everything they say in response should still feel realistic, there were far too many ""action movie lines"" that no one would ever say in real life. No one's heart seemed to be in this, and that was it's downfall. Reasonably well executed, Taken 3 falls flat in far too many other areas for me to possibly recommend it. After being framed for a murder he did not commit, Bryan Mills sets out to find the real killer while on the run from the law. Best Performance: Forest Whitaker"
" Taken, the end ?
",0.0,0.6542,2017-06-28 00:00:00,6,"The last episode of the saga ""Taken"" directed by Olivier Megaton who also realized the second film. I liked the early pursuit race, even if it was rather simple, it made the movie cool from the start. I've been waiting since the beginning of the saga for an adventure with Bryan's mates, unfortunately, it is only 30 minutes from the end and it takes too much direction of an Impossible Mission Force ... One of my regrets is that at times it's not credible, either for the car scene, even if we have an explanation or even the plane at the end, It's too much. Not bad to conclude (I hope) the saga, a 6/10. Taken, the end ?"
" Better than given credit for
",0.6705,0.9664,2017-05-21 00:00:00,8,"OK, so I've read many of the reviews of this movie and wanted to put my view forward, as I feel it has taken (no pun intended) something of a bashing ! Basically, I found it to be a good, enjoyable action movie – so there were no Albanians, and no-one was taken – so what ??? Why are people so hung up on these points ? The return of most of the original characters was a big plus, a familiarity, and a new plot which was plausible, lots of action and Neeson doing what he does best, with the involvement and interaction of his special group. As for a poor sequel – go back through 50 years of the industry – what sequels are even as good as the original – Jaws, Star Wars, Rocky, First Blood, Die Hard to name but a few. Yet I still think we are left with an entertaining action movie, and if you are prepared to sit back and enjoy the fantasy, as all movies are, rather than sit there with a pen and paper trying to find any holes and irregularities, that you could find with any movie, then this is what it is all about. Maybe not a typical Taken movie in the same sense that the first 2 were, but none-the-less, entertainment, action, and for me, it hit the right note."
" Ten Stars
",0.0,0.6364,2017-05-05 00:00:00,10,"Beautifully shot and amazingly mind stimulating. Never a dull moment. This movie touches on a subject many are afraid to talk about. A topic that should be at top of the list of importance not only in America, but, unfortunately everywhere. Doesn't hide behind smoke screens, yet, has the effect of exposing the truth without having to guide you to it. Taken is a movie that everyone should see with an open eye."
" rich third movie
",0.5574,-0.6652,2017-03-19 00:00:00,5,"you're getting the point of view here from someone who have not seen the previous two movies, but just by the family guy spoof realized some of the trademark bits has been repeated. some of the camera work, for example when they were in the diner, made it appear as if they were under surveillance. but not just a third movie action piece, some really thoughtful and some moving family moments and intense dialogue between the two guys. the violence almost reminds of a video game and its kind of scary finding yourself grown quite used to it as it has increased in movies through the decades. the role reminds a bit of the classic dark passage."
" Out With A Whimper
",0.0,0.9191,2017-03-02 00:00:00,3,"Despite the fact that I was wary about seeing this movie based on word-of-mouth and reviews, I decided to give it a try because its immediate predecessor—Taken 2—had still held my interest. Though I wasn't expecting anything like the spectacular original, I was hoping that ""Taken 3"" would bring closure (as advertised) to such an interesting concept.For a basic plot summary (minor spoilersnothing not seen in the trailer), ""Taken 3"" sees Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) trying to reconcile his relationship with ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), what with Kim (Maggie Grace) now being off on her own at college. When a meeting between the ex-lovers ends up with ""Lenny"" dead, however, Bryan is framed for the murder and must flee. On his tail is Detective Frank Dotzler (Forest Whitaker).The main, glaring problem with this film is as simple as it is obvious: In this trilogy, there really was only one excellent story to tell. In the first Taken, a unique plot is bolstered by very well- created characters. That EXACT same tact is used to create a carbon-copy sequel with ""Taken 2"". That flick still manages to be mildly entertaining because the characters are so strong. However, that well couldn't be gone back to a third time and have been believe-able. So, it goes off course and manages to get even worse. One could argue that only a exercise in screen writing perfection could have made this enjoyable. It was just running on fumes.Perhaps the most disappointing part of the experience, though, is that the trailer/advertising for the film depicts much more background on the Bryan Mills character. That is why I thought the movie might have some redeeming value, but it was not to be. That was obviously a ruse, as it doesn't come up in the film at all.It is also a bit disheartening to see the main actors of the piece try so hard but have so little to work with. The entire project is beneath Whitaker, Neeson is just a carbon-copy, and Grace absolutely acts her heart out in and provides really the only great scenes of the whole experience. I'm surprised she has not received more major roles in Hollywood after this franchise & LOST, as she is a great actress.Overall, ""Taken 3"" managed to suck every last penny out of a franchise built on a single story. In the future, when I recommend ""Taken"" to people, I probably won't even mention the two sequels (if maybe just to discourage their being watched). They just do not serve a purpose besides butts in theater seats."
" Great movie
",0.6249,-0.0523,2017-02-21 00:00:00,10,Great movie to end the trilogy. Full of action and suspense best watch on a night with popcorn after a long miserable day of injustice. I feel a bit sad that there won't be anymore but who knows what the future holds. I liked how it tied in elements from the first movie that gives a bit of a twist on who not to trust.
