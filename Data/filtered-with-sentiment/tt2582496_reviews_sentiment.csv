" Immy's review : Unique coming of age tale
",0.0,0.9983,2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,"Me, Earl and the Dying girl is a colourful, quirky teen movie about the subsequent friendship between awkward high schooler Greg, and a girl diagnosed with leukaemia, Rachel. The movie beautifully portrays the ample friendship between the two, and the realistic inner turmoil, confusion and self loathing attitude that many high schoolers feel. What I love about this movie is how different it is to other teen movies ; The film takes a different angle with the main leads typical teenage problems and puts them into perspective amidst Rachel's far worse troubles. The film doesn't glamorise Greg's problems or character, but instead conveys what he's doing wrong in how he's approaching life. His sensitive and overthinking nature, including his constant fear about what others think about him, is presented as something to challenge, not to embrace. What's also worth noting is the film leaves out the romance and portrays their friendship as simply platonic (Finally!). The movie had a superbly kinetic and eccentric direction, with bold editing and lively cinematography, creating a truly unique and charming production. Me, Earl and the Dying girl possessed a rare, true to life atmosphere, boasting a realistic depiction of high school and friendships, and the typical human emotions teenagers experience. All of the characters were individually significant and helped contribute something to Greg's character. I especially loved Earl with his pleasing personality and humour, whilst shining a light on Greg's mindset. What was truly astounding about this movie was that it retained its charming yet powerful demeanour from start to finish, and our attention to the characters never falters. If anything, we only become more and more engaged as we uncover further truths about each character, and start to possess the bigger picture. The ending was incredibly powerful ; It left me feeling surreal and detached, showing just how extraordinary this movie is. Overall, an incredibly well rounded and unique coming of age film with sharp and charming screenplay, some heart wrenching scenes and superb direction. Highly recommend!"
" Solid teen coming of age drama that does not rely on being mawkishly sentimental
",0.4404,0.9263,2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"In Pittsburgh, high school kid Greg (Thomas Mann) is made by his mum (Connie Britten) to call in on classmate Rachel (Olivia Cooke) who has cancer. A strong friendship develops between the two that helps them both and makes Greg more mature, less the self-absorbed loner that he had been.Less mawkish and clawingly sentimental than some other similar themed films as THE FAULT IN OUR STARS (2014). This adaptation by Jesse Andrews of his own book makes for a strong and enjoyable film ithat avoids the desperation to pull on the heartstrings. Well acted throughout, you feel the journey and development of these young people. In the process Alfonso Gomez-Rajon's direction makes some wonderful hommages to cinema, especially Michael Powell/Emeric Pressburger and Werner Herzog. R.J. Cyler as Greg's urban sidekick mate Earl gives Greg a taste of reality throughout and provides a good counter balance to Rachel and Greg."
" By far my favorite movie
",0.4588,0.8741,2020-07-31 00:00:00,10,This movie presented the perfect balance of comedy and sadness. It is not your classic romantic comedy but a friendship that changed a few lives for the better.
" Great film
",0.6249,0.9922,2020-07-29 00:00:00,8,"I didn't go into this film with the highest of expectations. I went in thinking this would be a decent if relatively average indie coming of age dramedy. While the film does have tropes that you would find in these movies. Thankfully it manages to be a very good film that I'd even go as far as to say I loved it. I adored the visual presentation of the film. In particular the incorporation of stop motion animation to reflect the characters mindstates. Me and Earl and The Dying Girl does a great job of subverting tropes that you see in films such as A Walk to Remember and The Fault in Our Stars. To create something more mature, funnier and ultimately more powerful.The final 20 minutes of the film are phenomenal. This portion is without a doubt the highlight of the film. It's amazing how many emotions are conveyed with little to no dialogue. I really enjoyed the homages to films such as A Clockwork Orange, Harold and Maude, The 400 Blows, Aguirre The Wrath of God and many others. They were all really funny and charming even if you haven't seen the films in question. Though it's an added bonus if you have.I had some problems with this. The film does try a bit too hard to be quirky at points. The last act before the final 20 minutes does drag a bit. I also would've liked if the character of Earl got more development. Though otherwise Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is an excellent coming of age film that I'd highly recommend."

" A quirky, impressive film that leaves you smiling
",0.743,0.9244,2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"Very rarely do you come across a movie that is made far better than the book was written. Infact I usually detest adaptations of books because often times you have writers changing the ending or skipping whole characters and parts unnecessarily to appeal to the mainstream movie audience, using the same repeated tropes. Having read the book by Jesse Andrews, and armed with mild cynicism, I began the movie with low expectations of the movie to surpass the book.And I was very surprised. The movie brings alive the high school story of a boy who is forced to befriend a girl diagnosed with cancer, with superb use of music and camera work. The lead actors, Thomas Mann and Olivia Cooke have given performances far beyond their years. However, the standout from the film has to be the artwork. Nevermind that I wasnt expecting the artwork in the film to blow my mind, it simply left me with my mouth hanging open. It was such a happy surprise, I hate to say it, it leaves you believing in the good things the world can sometimes do. I won't say anymore on this, I just hope you are convinced enough to watch the movie till the end. Please allow the movie's art department to leave you surprised."
" Refreshing

" ""We can't tell anyone we're on drugs.""
",0.0,0.9288,2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,"For a morose subject telegraphed by the title of the movie, this actually did have some hilarious moments, almost always delivered by teenager Greg (Thomas Mann), who turns out to be the 'Me' of the story. Yes, there is a dying girl here, statements made throughout the picture to the contrary, as if setting up the denouement is intended to take some of the edge off things. Earl is Greg's best bud, but they don't act like it much until the friendship is tested by the unraveling of events. In a way, it's a teenage coming of age story without the emphasis on sex, refreshing actually because it explores deeper matters of life and death in a way that isn't too heavy handed. You'll probably want to keep a spare hankie around for the end of the story, which does find a way to be uplifting despite the tragic consequences of Rachel's (Olivia Cooke) illness. Quirky would be one way to describe the picture, but that word gets used a bit much. Let's just say that for it's subject matter, you'll come away with an appreciation for the simple things that bring people together in hope and friendship."

I nearly walked out of the film because I feared my sobs could be heard by those sitting around me, and because of how emotionally, destructively brilliant it is.This was a Mommy-esque experience, a Beasts of the Southern Wild-esque experience, for me.... a depressing, overwhelming, cathartic cinematic expression of the knowledge of the world, knowledge of pain, knowledge of hardships, knowledge of pure human spirit and the highs and lows which it encapsulates.I have nothing more to say for now.I am broken."

The dying girl is the same actress as the girlfriend in Bates Motel tv series, playing a similar role, and is the anchor against which the drama rocks. The characters here are really likeable. The two lead protagonists are humble and yet a source of fantastic creativity, their works bouncing around the film and adding heart and colour to proceedings. It's a highly unusual story, with unexpected rays of sunshine around every corner. I highly recommend Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. It's an easy watch for sure as it is so inspiring, and will be remembered as a classic."

So in conclusion, go read the book it's just like the movie but better"
" Ehhhhhh....
",0.0,-0.1533,2019-03-27 00:00:00,6,"I did not like this film as much as others seemed to. And I think thats partially because I had just read the book beforehand. Which I know you should judge a movie on its own merits...but its kind of hard when the characterizations seemed so off. First of all Greg is awkward sure, but he's not mean. And this version came across a lot meaner. Like, he never says that his mom is making him spend time with her (even though its true) cause he knows that would hurt her feelings, or the cafeteria scene he makes up silly story/joke about how his food is alien barf and how another student is an alien but its super obvious that its clearly joke...he doesnt randomly make fun of another student's walk. There was just little things like those that rubbed me the wrong way. I also felt that Molly Shannon was woefully miscast. She plays it so weirdly like shes trying to come on to these teenagers. Even the scene where she's being interviewed for Greg and Earl's movie is being played for laughs when its meant to be serious. And I feel like the movie missed the point of the book. The book clearly states from the beginning that this isnt some typical sappy story where its going to shed you some insight on how her cancer changed his life...blah blah blah. But the movie sure wanted to go that way.Like, its not a terrible film....just not what I was expecting. I was fine with them cutting out certain aspects of the book/condensing or adding stuff in like the prom. I mean whatever, that are small insignificant things that dont overall change the story. I just feel about 20 min, the movie started to really change direction. Not too mention that some parts feel rushed.Overall, I did like the actors in this (minus Molly Shannon), and I really liked the addition of the stop motion and seeing the fake movies. And there are funny, cute, and some heartwarming moments.I liked it, but didnt love it."

" Sad and awkward meet in one movie.
",-0.5719,0.9843,2019-02-06 00:00:00,8,"This is a comically dark movie. It gets boring sporadically; to clarify, it wasn't as much captivating at the beginning, but became touching in the last scenes. I advise you, not to expect much out of it, so you don't get frustrated, but I can say it's an overall above average movie. This film deals with loss, particularly, losing people to diseases like cancer. The film is an admixture of ludicrousness and melancholy which is super hard to be done, On the positive side, I feel elated now that I've watched this as it had a lot of real-life events going on. The filming photography was marvelous, and the overall visual effect made this amusing to watch (colors, camera angles, editing) not to mention the carved pieces of art. Thomas Mann perfectly played his role by doing a fascinating character with a reluctance to be a real friend with anyone except for Earl he is a socially awkward teenager with a quirky personality; on the other hand, Olivia Cooke was even better; I believe that's due to her wistful facial features I was convinced she is a cancer patient. Furthermore, the movie touches upon many common topics like fitting in school and applying to college, and all the pressure that come with that, like anxiety and self-loathing, but there is a lot to like in the way Mann comes to realize that he is not quite as defeatist as he once thought gives you the sense of self-discovering while being attached to people. Given the key themes of terminal illness and death, I reckon the tenor of the scenario has been clear, it was not to let yourself detached from social life no matter how hard it gets."

" from a few different perspectives
",0.0,0.9944,2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"This is a film that is easily appreciated. To use a very uncommon phase, I do beileve that the film was better than the book. This is in no disregared to the author himself. I really did enjoy the text. In fact, its rare for me to be writting about a film in which I read the book first. I am movie of a movie person, always have been. I don't really feel like you would be writing on here (or reading for that matter) if you weren't. But what do I know.For what I would give about 90%, the film was accurate to the text. And I give my applause to them, because while the book was funny and well timed, it can be hard to recite tine from a book in a film without it feeling incredibly cheesy. Many things just sound better in your head- its a fact. But Thomas Mann had the perfect amount of whit and sarcasm to pull it off. As someone who many have just watched the film, I was convinced that this was the perfect person to comfort a dying girl. Well done.What put the film over the edge of the book would be the ending. Having Rachel die while watching the film, then more or less cutting to the visitation at her house was so beautiful in comparison to the crude ending of the novel where the film os showed to the entire school and Greg and Earl are left feeling completely rejected. I suppose the books can get away with this type of reality in there work, as they are much more complicated and have many more aspects in which to appreciate and notice. This movie was shooting for a good time- as all are, and needed a more sweet ending. They nailed it. Although there is a heart gripping moment that Greg has with his mom that I wished I could have seen, I understand how that may clash with the overall tone of the film. It is, after all, the most lighthearted take of one of most heavy situations. For this instance, I enjoyed what I watched more so than what I read, and that is the truth.I rally hated writing that because I find those comparisons rather annoying, but I also felt like it was worth being said. As an appreciation of the film itself, the style of editing was a great reflection of the style in which Greg and Earl made films themselves. Completely genius. Also stunned on how the soundtrack could seem so fitting for the theme without being overly powerful or overly know. Many film of this sort do try to use smaller artist and many times just miss the mark. Or they may just a song too well know, it which I call them a try hard.I do recommend this film. It timeless in the most casual of ways."

It's a comically dark story with a cast of mostly unknown actors playing a variety of quirky characters. It almost feels like a Wes Anderson movie.

Instead it feels like another derivative independent film with tinges of sadness.Greg (Thomas Mann) and childhood buddy, Earl (RJ Cyler) have made numerous bad parody films with titles such as Death in Tennis, A Sockwork Orange and My Dinner with Andre the Giant.Greg is detached and self absorbed. He refers to Earl as his co-worker rather than best friend, in fact his only friend. Greg's parents force him to be friendly with Rachel (Olivia Cooke) a girl he knew from kindergarten who has been diagnosed with leukemia.The self centered Greg develops a warm relationship with the dying Rachel and he sets about making an original film for her.The film is a little too knowing, trying too hard to be eccentric. The characters of Earl and Rachel are actually not well developed. It is all about Greg and he is not that interesting. While Earl and his brother come across as horrible black stereotypes."

" Fun, Emotional, with Very Pure Performances,
",0.5994,0.9972,2018-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a great movie with a well written plot and a stellar cast. It is a film that manages to balance emotional, heavy themes with very subtle, but also side slittingly hilarious comedy. The many film parodies Earl and Greg make are a delight, just as much as the scenes with Rachel that nearly had me in tears. However, I will say that the film is not as special as it thinks it is, there is an air of confidence throughout that they are doing something unlike any other film, but I can think of several other movies (The Way Way Back, Rushmore) that created a very likewise vibe. As well as that, it constantly refers to what is going to happen at the end in a way that they clearly thought they were being clever, but I did not care for it. The cast is all around brilliant, Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke are all the stars in their titular roles, and the likes of Molly Shannon, Nick Offerman and Jon Bernthal also shine in smaller, but very noticeable parts. Fun and sweet. A very enjoyable hour and a half, I would recommend Me and Earl and the Dying Girl to anyone looking for a good comedy drama. 
A young boy gets involved with a new girl in town, despite her fatal illness. 
Best Performance: Olivia Cooke"
" Ease the pain, then bring it back: Awesome
",0.5106,0.9004,2018-03-14 00:00:00,9,"This film is truly original. I can not stop thinking about it. Everything it shows you is necessary from beginning to end. The narator tells the watcher she doesn't die in the end, and that takes the attention away from the girl and it brings a real ""coming of age"" vibe to the story. This is supported by the great way it shows how you can feel when someone you like touches you and more. 
But then, in the end, she dies anyway. Even though everyone suspected this, it is still a great plot twist and it brings back the pain of losing. This makes the end the pinnacle of the movie, and end this fenomenal scenario. Thank you to everyone credited."

It changes how you feel about a person who's slowly passing away. Each moment of their life is a pain knowing that it's never coming back and probably before anything even comes close would be too late. The decisions one's gotta make, irrespective whether you've been in the life of the person before the news spread or not.

Beautifully directed and acted. It makes you want to keep watching.
However, as the film progresses, it drags, slows, and you only watch because you want to know how it ends.
I doubt anyone expects this to be a laugh a minute film, but there is little light to the shade here.
I can't say this was the best way to spend 105 minutes although some people obviously find this film moving, but not me. So I suggest that you only watch this film if you like a film that is slow, artistic and very drawn out."
" Uniquely normal and different

The way it is scripted is slightly different. It is based on a debut novel of Jesse Andrews with the same name.Greg (Thomas Mann) is a loner in high school. He is forced by his parents to meet a childhood friend Rachel (Olivia Cooke) who has been diagnosed with cancer. At first neither of two are interested in each other, but Greg's quirkiness interests Rachel and they meet regularly. Grey introduces her to his friend Earl (RJ Cyler) with whom he is making parodies of famous films. Earl convinces Greg to spend more time with Rachel. Grey , unknowingly sacrifices his life, his studies, his work, because he wants to make a film for Rachel. When Rachel's opts out of chemotherapy, Greg is devastated and argues with her and fights with Earl.who thinks Greg is very insensitive person. When Rachel - in the final stage of cancer and admitted to hospital -depresses Grey more. In the end Greg visits Rachel to show the film he made for her. While watching the film Rachel falls in a coma and dies after few hours. Greg reads a letter written by Rachel. He realizes that like him Rachel too was in LOVE. Greg pens down a book about his LOVE and along with the video mails it to his college.The film reflects a deeper complexities of feelings among two people in LOVE - who meet each other, exchange and talk to each other - but face an ordeal to cognizant & accept their LOVE feeling...Director Alfanso who was an assistant to Martin Scorsese wanted to show his style of film-making sensibilities reflecting the loss he faced in life of his father through this filmHe does a commendable job directing this unique interesting film. Thomas Mann and Olivia Cooke have acted well along with Rj Cyler, whose role as Earl is a bit curtailed in the movie. The movie grabbed several awards and nominations in many festivals. The songs of the movie are heart-warming. It is a good watch for people who are not in touch with their own sense of inner LOVE and unaware of their feelings of LOVE for others.I would go with 6.25"
" Most Beautiful Movie I've Ever Seen, Not to Mention Hilarious
",0.4469,0.9969,2018-01-14 00:00:00,10,"It's rare that I give a movie a 10 out of 10. Yet, I had good reason. This movie was hands down the most beautifully developed and heart-wrenchingly performed movie I've ever seen. It really made me realize that there are still good people, and people who appreciate good people, out there. Though it's a movie, movies like this can only be based on real life experiences that really rip your heart apart. Greg is so quirky and awkward, but in a rare and hilarious way, and Earl just adds to the hilarity. His pure genuineness, kindness, and 'over-the-top humility,' as Rachel put it, come packaged in that awkward casing; deep down you knew those former qualities were always there, but they truly emerge and blossom as you see him give of himself to Rachel day in and day out. He almost sacrificed his senior year and future for her. That is true friendship and love at its finest.Though Greg started spiraling (understandably) when he found out Rachel was stopping treatment, he showed his true colors when he brought the corsage to the hospital to give to his date. My heart was very satisfied when I heard that ambulance as he got out of the limo. He proved to be a real gentleman and good person, which are rare commodities nowadays. I think the beauty of the movie truly hit me at the end of the movie when they revealed quirky and artistic things about Rachel even after her death. (On a side note, I knew that I couldn't believe Greg when he said she wouldn't die That was the only thing he said in that movie that didn't sound genuine.) As Greg walked through the room, perusing her shelves of concave book art, and as I watched him trace the squirrel's path from wall tree to wall tree, hearing him describe the story behind her ashes being thrown in the park behind her house, I couldn't help but fall in love with her character and the movie as a whole. The ending was frustrating and painful and deeply heart-wrenching, but piercingly beautiful. I would watch this 1,000 times more. I don't know if I even want to watch another movie like it because I'll always have this profound, magnificent.movie to compare it to. I am deeply wonderfully satisfied."
" Realistic, sometimes poignant, and mostly-fun film
",0.0,0.9934,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is a solid coming-of-age film - it's charming and funny and definitely not as depressing as the title may have you believe. It's a simple concept - the not-quite nerdy, not-quite cool high-schooler, Greg (Mann), is forced by his mum to hang out with a classmate who has just being diagnosed with leukaemia, Rachel (Cooke). It's starts off as an awkward friendship, but slowly turns into genuine friendship.Earl (Cyler) is great as Greg's only friend (or ""co-worker"" as he calls him) and lots of the film's fun comes from the parodies they make together of classic films - such as 'Senior Citizen Cane', 'The Seven Seals', 'A Sockwork Orange', 'Eyes Wide Butt' & my favourite, 'Grumpy Cul-de-Sacs'! - most featuring clever animation and hilarious ultra-low-budget imitations. Earl acts as Greg's conscience when he turns into a shellfish teenager and forgets about Rachel's actual problems. The parents (Shannon, Offerman & Britton) all have some great scenes.The film's score, by Brian Eno, is fantastic and really adds to the emotion, especially towards the end. The finale is handled well and shows impact we can have others' lives by just being there for them. Sure, it's sad in parts, but it's realistic and it is nice to watch how Greg and Rachel handle the situation mostly with good-humour. The funny moments outweigh the sad ones and make this an enjoyable film."
" Delightfully grounding
",0.5719,0.8689,2017-09-30 00:00:00,9,"If Wes Anderson had written and directed his high-school years - only with slightly more clichés than he'd be comfortable with - I'd like to imagine that 'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' would be the final product. The character of Greg embodies a delightfully grounding balance of cynicism, pragmatism and child-like imagination that ultimately produces an immensely satisfying and perplexing lens through which to view the world."
" Gem bordering on little masterpiece
",0.5868,0.9742,2017-09-23 00:00:00,10,"Well, I can't believe that a film managed to engage me this much. I always hope and yet never expect movies to be that good. There's so much try-hard rubbish now.Somehow, this managed to remain exceptional, despite being a 'coming of age' movie. Completely lacking sentimentalism, perfectly cast, excellent acting.The first couple of minutes left me wondering if it was going to be stupid, but this was a really wonderful, clever work that never felt immature or cutesy."
" A decent film with a good message
",0.4404,0.7585,2017-08-26 00:00:00,3,"Based on a best selling book this film followed suit, and did quite well through word of mouth.I enjoyed it, I thought the difficult subject matter was dealt with well, and that the young cast did well in their roles.It wasn't as an original premise as it would like to make itself out to be, with 'Now is good' and 'Fault in our Stars' covering similar ground, but it was a decent enough film."
" How a Book to Movie Remake Should Be
",0.0,0.9738,2017-07-01 00:00:00,10,"In this era of every movie being based on a book, Me and Earl and The Dying Girl proves that maybe the movie can be better than the book. Jesse Andrews, the author of the book, sets up the story perfectly for a film adaptation, to the point where it almost seems as if this was his true intent with the story. This film is beautiful, it plays with stop motion, shaped frames, camera angles and drawing in a way that no other film has done in recent years. The handmade aesthetic of the film is perfect for the main character Greg as his mind sees the world through film. This is a movie for everyone, film fanatics will appreciate the many references and homages to past films and people looking for a teen, cancer romance will find this is the perfect story, feel good and heart breaking. This film is often compared to The Fault in Our Stars, for a good reason, the stories are very similar, however Me and Earl seems to be what TFIOS could have been. This film stands alone, an audience doesn't need to read the book to understand and fall in love/hate with the characters. The acting and direction is stunning, with the three leading teens stealing the show. This is truly a spectacle of what teen flicks could be if we don't settle for the mediocre films being produced today."
" A movie about movies shows us how movies should be made
",0.0,0.9887,2017-06-16 00:00:00,9,"This is my first movie review ever. I'm not quite sure why I'm writing this but as I write this I think its because I feel a bit like Greg (who writes about stuff too, sort of like this). Don't worry that's not a spoiler that is literally the first minute of the film. And the rest of the many wonderful minutes that follow that first minute are probably also what compelled me to write this review. Please watch this movie. It is artistic, subtle, wholesome, well enacted, extremely well conceptualized and just a good movie. And so well written (hats off Jesse Andrews). Cinematography is innovative. Stunning. There's this one scene where the camera tilts and tilts back. Not sure why but I loved it so much.I may not remember this movie next month and I may not feel the way I do right now a month in, but right now this movie has me on the feels train heading to 'Feelistan'. 10/10. Did I give it 9 stars? I lied."
" It has the classic indie vibe that you expect
",0.0,0.9624,2017-06-05 00:00:00,9,"If you watched the trailer for this movie, you will probably expect the classic indie drama with romantic spice on the top of it. Well, yes this is that kind of movie. You will find the typical stereotypes in every young-adult movie; The awkward protagonist with a somewhat comical relieve best friend and of course the girl which the whole story resolves throughout the movie. Even though the concept seems predictable and recycled, it doesn't make it not enjoyable. The directing and editing of this movie are some work of art, the pacing flows smoothly every bits of the frame is really enjoyable. It has great soundtrack despite they aren't used often and the timing is perfect. The acting is relatively great despite some minor characters. In the end, this is not a flick for you to watch if you are expecting some Oscar level piece or some life transcending movie experience. But if you want to just chill and feel some good vibe to waste your time alone or with some friends (I prefer alone) This one will definitely be a classic."
" Both hilarious and heartbreaking
",-0.0772,0.9641,2017-05-30 00:00:00,8,"I very much enjoyed this film. It is full of humor, relatable characters, and heartfelt moments. The tribute/parody films made by the characters were hilarious and definitely spoke to my inner film nerd. The film transitions from being very lighthearted to a more serious tone in the later part of the movie. However, this change was gradual and came across naturally. This film is cleaver with its use of humor and tasteful with its use of sorrow. It doesn't come across as sappy or cheesy when the emotional moments occur. Overall, I highly recommend this film for anyone looking to laugh and/or cry.8/10...but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Once"
" Overdramatic teenager goes through a tough time
",-0.128,0.9554,2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"What do you do when a friend is dying? We focus on that terrifying moment and forget about everything that's going on around us. In a way, that's the central theme of this movie. How can we remain empathetic when we're suffering too? Having a teenager go through this is a great choice. Especially one that's weird, dramatic and awkward. It helped make moments that would make you cringe feel meh. A few of those moments missed the mark, but the rest were pretty effective. I enjoyed this movie because it felt real, and even though it can tough at times it's definitely worth your time."
" 20th Century Fox reaches forward into the 21st Century in its pursuit of Spoiler Alerts . . .

When Fox starts its classic movie channel to compete against Arch-Rival Ted Turner and CNN's current old movie recycling center, expect to see loads of similar Renamings from the folks who invented Fake News and Alternative Facts. For instance, SHOOTING THE BREEZE is a much more indefinite approach to the War to End Racist Southern Dudes' Black Slavery than GONE WITH THE WIND (four words which suggest gloom and doom). Similarly, TITANIC has become a buzzword for terrible tragedy, so expect Fox to screen History's second-most popular bladder-buster as SHOOTING FOR A TRANS-ATLANT!C CROSSING RECORD. John Steinbeck's indictment of the Rich People Party's Government Of-, By-, and For the Fat Cat One Per Centers--GRAPES OF WRATH--won't sit well with Fox's target audience (most of whom possess brains held hostage by Stockholm Syndrome), so Fox will try to maintain ratings by offering it as a more Panglossian-sounding SHOOTS OF GRASS. And surely THE SMITH WHO SHOD LIBERTY VALANCE will be less of a Dead-Giveaway than is the original title of this James Stewart\Marion Morrison Oater."
" Living and Dying
",0.0,0.6447,2017-03-13 00:00:00,7,"Life changes for a philosophical high school student when his mother guilts him into keeping a classmate dying of leukemia company in this quirky comedy starring Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke as the three title characters. The trajectory of the film is not hard to predict with Mann (the 'Me' in the title) coming to truly appreciate his new friend and reevaluate the way he has pigeonholed all of his peers over the years. And yet, the film remains thoroughly encapsulating thanks to witty, observant narration from Mann and a fun subplot in which Mann and Cyler ""swede"" classic films, 'Be Kind Rewind' style. There are some well done moose and chipmunk claymation scenes too that reflect how Mann feels about the girl who he has a crush on taunting him. It is Mann's highly calculated approach to surviving the high school experience that stands out the most though with his attempts to befriend everyone and every clique at his school to avoid developing enemies. He makes for a fascinating character too with his reluctance to call anyone a true friend out of fear of rejection. The final few scenes of the film go a little overboard in his painting Man as a generous, giving and selfless soul behind his detached exterior, but there is a lot to like in the way Mann comes to realise that he is not quite as cynical as he once thought. Given the key themes of death and dying, the movie makes a sharp argument for never letting oneself get too detached in life no matter how hard some things may be to endure."
" Empty
",-0.2023,-0.9759,2017-03-06 00:00:00,2,"I prepared myself with tissues considering the subject matter. I did cry, but not because the film was good. It wasn't good, it was very bad. It tried too hard to be quirky, and at times it reminded me of the film, Juno. Kids with snappy one liners-- saying things that young people don't say. The girl dying from cancer had a Mom who was drunk,and overly inappropriate with the girl's male friends. That was about it. She also had a weird sad face. Somewhere between drunk, and constipated. The young man wasn't likable, in fact his emotionless quips were slightly psychotic. And his parents were so odd, and one dimensional. The Dad, he always plays the same type of character in all his films, Nick somebody-- aka. Ron Swanson in a caftan. No one stood out too me at all. I don't remember their names, or what they said, or did. The ending was particularly creepy -- the boy sneaking into the dead girl's room and looking at her things, and trying to find meaning in it. It was empty."

" Emotional, but not manipulative
",0.0772,0.9722,2017-02-03 00:00:00,8,"If I had to pick a single genre of Hollywood movies to save from a global catastrophe, I'd go with the coming of age films. Because it's probably the only type of films in which it's not just about business and grossing revenues. Such movies are also a way to establish a communication between generations, to talk to our youth and both teach them something and explain that the world around isn't as cold and ugly as they might think. Not every film succeeds at that cultural mission, but at least most sincerely try. Which, in the modern world where kids are especially estranged from their parents, is a big deal indeed.Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is another step forward in this intergenerational dialogue. But, unlike some parents who honestly believe that since they are not young themselves then their kids' issues are nothing but some laughable nonsense, this film never ridicules its heroes.Nor does it oversweeten things. MaEatDG might sound similar to The Fault In Our Stars because it revolves around the topic of cancer, but, besides that, those films have nothing in common. And it's a good thing, because the last thing TFiOS had was sincerity. Instead, that movie glamorized cancer and that feeling of being terminally ill as if it's some sexy little perk that only makes you more appealing or interesting. However, death is definitely no fun, and fighting death might be an even less of it, which is the dark part of the picture MaEatDG didn't shy away from showing. Showing without making things pretty or convenient, and showing without intentionally making them too ugly to squeeze yet another tear of forcibly induced sympathy. Nah, unlike John Green, Jesse Andrews, on whose novel this film is based upon, decided to use more delicate colors and emotional intonations to make the story of Greg and Rachel both believable and relatable.One needs a big talent to make a gripping story about the things that happen to people routinely. And let's be sincere: just like becoming an adult, death is something most of us have a first-hand knowledge about. So I'm genuinely amazed how Alfonso Gomez-Rejon managed to pull off a movie so deep and touching about the issues so familiar and maybe even banal: finding your true self, establishing a real cost of friendship, learning to love others and yourself, fighting for personal liberty of creativity and choice. When we grow older, we tend to lose those memories of the time when we were still in the making as humans. And if this film manages to remind someone on the older side how it is to be that ball of clay, still unsure which shape to take, and maybe show someone on the younger side that the life is beautiful enough to find courage to explore it, then Hollywood hasn't been completely in vain."
" 'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is a believable film with wonderful portrayed characters and with great things to say about illness, social life and creativity. 10/10
",0.8271,0.9996,2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"Tiltle: Me and Earl and the Dying Girl (2015) – No Spoilers!Characters and acting: One of the biggest pro's I can give this this movie is that all of the characters felt real in their motivations, reactions, emotions and the way they delivered their lines. The main character is portrayed by Thomas Mann. I haven't seen him in any other films, but judging by his age, he has a great career to look forward to. His chemistry with Rachel (played by Olivia Cooke) is spectacular. Not only is the build up done so well, but the way they deliver lines at each other and how the create inside jokes is a pleasure to witness on screen. I could talk for ages about the great actors in this movie, but the best way to describe them is 'real'.Story and Dialogue: The story is surprisingly simple, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the execution of it has been done with care. Thankfully the filmmakers knew about the fact that you have probably heard this story numerous times, so they found a believable way to sort of make fun of it without taking away from the tone. The dialogue is often so fun and relate able. It is filled with clever jokes or comments about high school, life or sickness. This is the type of movie where you want to grab your phone or your notes every few minutes to write down that awesome quote.Editing and Pacing: In these types of movies I'm always kind of nervous if there isn't a long middle-part where the pace hugely goes down. The length is as perfect as it can be. If it was longer it could have become boring and if it was shorter it would have been too rushed. In the terms of editing it has definitely some stand-out moments, there are some really fun stop-motion segments or creative filmmaking bits (keeping things vague because of spoilers).Cinematography and Effects: The cinematography in this film is just lovely to watch. Not only are there some really neat camera tricks but it makes use of the entire screen instead of just the middle. Aside from that, the colors and the symmetry in the short look awesome, it actually manages to make high school look beautiful. Also a lot of repetition is found between several shots with different meanings, you can really see that the filmmakers put effort in making a film with usage of visual ques to tell a story.Rewatchability: In a lot of movies like this I feel like there normally isn't much rewatchability value. Once you finally know what's going to happen it could make your second viewing less interesting. I feel like the value in this film is much greater though, mostly because of the combination of great characters mixed with genuine dialogue. I was so invested in the characters that I would mind seeing them a second, third or perhaps even a fourth time. In terms of foreshadowing, there is quite a lot of it, some of it in some small character moments that you wouldn't even notice when paying not enough attention. This would definitely make your second watching worth wile.Deeper Meaning or Motives/Themes: This movie has quite a lot to say about dealing with illness (obviously), finding your place in school or in your social life, having friends, showing yourself and being who you are and showing your creativity.Tone: The tone of the movie is so interesting. I should say it's a drama, but on the other hand, this movie is funny as hell, but I also wouldn't consider this a comedy. It's like a drama with great comedic elements. Aside from that the tone is really consistent and it didn't do anything that took me out of the movie, I stayed invested throughout the entire film.Personal Response: With the smart and fun dialogue this movie grabbed me pretty quick. Then after a while I became invested in the characters. After like half an hour I was wondering if they would go the easy way with the story. Then the movie surprisingly took a few turns that I didn't expect and it kept me interested in the story. Something really interesting that this movie did to me which had never occurred to me before was that I felt the emotion several minutes after the movie had ended. Normally there are certain scenes that give you the feels, but this time I felt it after and it still kept me engaged. When a movie can accomplish something like that, it earns my deepest respect. Conclusion: 'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' is a believable film with wonderful portrayed characters and with great things to say about illness, social life and creativity. 10/10"
" Paper-thin and pandering
",0.0,-0.9168,2017-01-25 00:00:00,2,"Ugh. I'm not opposed to films that have an offbeat sense of humour, but stylistically this did very little for me. The distractingly showy direction is just one of the facets through which Me and Earl and the Dying Girl expresses its inflated self-importance. In reality, it is absolutely unremarkable and significantly less intelligent than it assumes itself to be.I'm not sure how much of the overwhelming praise for this film originates from the gimmick of referencing classic cinema. This is likely recognition-humour in its most irritating manifestation. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon invites the audience to engage in a circle jerk of ego-stroking – a showcase of how well-read and cineliterate we all are (All the while never choosing a film not already archived by Criterion).*It doesn't help that the main character is just as self-obsessed and detestable as the film itself. 'I know you're really bracing for this sweet girl, that you probably like a lot, to die', he says in the terribly self-aware narration, yet the film does so little to endear us to Rachel. This is an odd choice, considering any emotional punch depends upon this attachment. The titular Earl, too, is entirely one-dimensional. The secondary characters appear to exist only in the presence of the protagonist. Rather than give these characters any depth, we instead get to watch Greg be entitled for an hour and 45 minutes.The end product provokes little other than indifference. I don't care about the cut- outs masquerading as characters, and I really don't care about Greg and his problems. Even dealing with such a heavy topic, the film is so wrapped in cliché and so smugly post-modern at the expense of any sense of realistic grounding that any gravity evaporates – kudos to Gomez-Rejon on this one, it's genuinely an achievement to provoke so little sympathy for a character with cancer.*Gomez-Rejon, to Martin Scorsese: ""You turned me onto film history as a kid. This was a way to continue that tradition, by talking about movies that a younger generation could go out and find, and not necessarily the popular ones."" Ugh."

I laughed, I cried, I cheered. It also took me back to the days I was in High-School. The creativity and complexity of each character keep you locked in. I found myself truly caring about each individual character, and even saw some of myself, friends, and family members in them.The style and tone of the movie make it wonderful to view. Many unique camera angles and intimate shots. I just loved the overall feel during the movie, and was left with a feeling of peace once it was finished. I truly enjoyed and highly recommend."
