",0.0,0.9711,2021-02-24 00:00:00,7,"This is movie is not very great but it's not bad either it's just average especially for a sequel. The choreography is decent but I expected far better from yuen woo ping( the fight choreographer of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Matrix, Fearless and many more) and the performances and script are disappointing compared to the other movies but still not bad. Overall this movie isn't bad but there are movies far better than it like ""Iron Monkey"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" which have both amazing choreography and great performances."

" Not all that great as a movie in my opinion, but some good fight scenes still
",-0.1771,0.807,2020-09-13 00:00:00,6,"At this point the ""plot"" doesn't really make sense so this is just a succession of fight scenes, some of them being extremely well done. The style is quite different considering Yuen Woo Ping took over Sammo Hung as fight director and while both equally great, the change is pretty obvious. There are still some memorable moments; the Thai fighter and Mike Tyson scenes immediately become classic fights. As with the previous one, they really should have gotten some white actors who can actually act..."
" Boring and no charisma
",-0.5423,-0.0547,2020-09-10 00:00:00,2,A lot of boring fights that never ends and no actual story. Only tje figth with Tyson is a bit entertaining. Watch Boyka movies instead.
" Some good fight scenes, OK script
",0.4995,0.7906,2020-08-02 00:00:00,5,"Mike Tyson wishes he was that good again, but the movie wouldn't be any good with out him. Sure Yip Man was a real martial arts master, but by the time they finished Part 2, I was sure that there was nothing else to his life.Yet, writers make up crap and will turn reality in to fantasy.There isn't much more to the script to be thrilled. The fight scenes have tons of cuts and slow motion to make things look exciting, but the choreographing is over dubbed. They really put too much in to the editing rather than having real fights."
" This IMO May Be The Best Of The Three ...

Sure it has the usual coterie of fights and so forth, but it also shows a different side to IP's character, when he interacts with his wife. Make's him totally real and believable as a human being. Both the fights in the elevator - and one at the end, to determine WHO is thee best are amazing. Don't miss this movie if you want to spend a great 90 minutes or so of action and entertainment."

" More Yip Man
",0.0,0.9624,2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,"I do wonder if Yip Man 4 will actually be the last. After the ""initial"" trilogy (not even sure that was planned), the prequel (Zero), some spinoffs (mostly inoffical as far as I know) and last years fourth installment ... I mean who knows, right? I have not seen last years movie, but I will do so for sure. Big fan of Donnie Yens and I reckon anyone who likes Martial Arts knows what I mean.Having said all that, we continue the path of Bruce Lees teacher. Though Bruce Lee had a different name ... one that is being used here, when we see him (the actor portraying him that is of course) at the beginning of this movie visiting Yip Man. You may see a similarity in his looks - the casting was quite spot on here. But the movie once again does not revolve around the teachings of Bruce Lee. This is just a short episode, before we get to the meat of things. A group of bad guys trying to take over a school. Their leader? Mike Tyson - a mixed bag of beans I think is what some would call it.Which brings us to the fights. As can be expected very well made and thought out. So far this was my personal favorite ... even if the Sammo Hung fight in part 2 may be my personal favorite when it comes to fights overall. The story here I think worked best. Straight forward and quite the nice pace to it too. Everything is subjective of course as you know"
" TWO TITANS FACE OFF
",0.0,-0.9907,2020-06-06 00:00:00,9,"The Ip Man series continues with this film which was promoted as having one major item folks would want to see: Donnie Yen vs Mike Tyson. It didn't matter that Tyson has a small role here, that was something people were interested in seeing. Fortunately the fight sequence between the two delivers the goods and last more than a minute or two and Tyson holds up his performance quite well. But on to the story.The year is now 1959 and Ip Man's school is well established. So much so that a cocky young fighter comes in wanting to be trained. Demonstrating his speed and agility, Ip Man does nothing more than open the door for him and watch him walk out. The student's name is Bruce Lee.Ip Man's song Ip Ching gets into a fight at school and both boys parents are called in. Only the Ips show and they then invite the other young boy, Cheung Fung, to their home for dinner. When he shows them his Wing Chun abilities they ask who his teacher is to which the boy replies his father Cheung Tin-chi. Tin-chi drives a rickshaw and is saving money to open his own school while raising his son on his own. He picks up the boy and thanks them for taking care of his son.Tin-chi is also making extra money on the side fighting in underground fights organized by Ma King-sang, a triad leader who works for Frank (Tyson). What he doesn't know is that Frank is also a developer with his eyes set on the piece of land where Ip Man and Tin-chi's sons attend school. Ma sends his men there to disrupt the school but Ip Man comes along and prevents them from doing so. He and his students then become protectors of the school.When Tin Ngo-san, Ma's mentor, learns of his behavior he goes to confront him with Ip Man. Humiliated in front of his men he attempts to stab Tin but Ip Man prevents him from killing him. Ip Man's friend Fat Po the police officer shows and breaks things up. Seeking revenge Ma hires Tin-chi to kill Tin Ngo-san. In desperate need of money to open his school he takes the job and beats Ngo-san within an inch of his life.Ip Man goes to visit Tin having been called to do so. When he arrives he learns that the call never came from him, instead it was a ruse to get him away from the school where Ma and his gang have kidnapped a bunch of the children including Ip Chin and Cheung Fung. Ip Man goes to the docks where Ma told him to only to find him threatening to kill his son and sell the rest into slavery. Cheung Tin-chi also shows but Ma gives him his son and tells him to leave. Ma's men attack and Ip does well against them, doing more so when Tin-chi returns to help. All seems lost when Fat Po and his men arrive to break things up.At home Ip Man learns that his long loving wife has been diagnosed with cancer. Returning home after getting her medicine Ip is attacked by a Thai boxer hired by Frank to take him out. Instead Ip takes on the boxer and finished the fight in quick time. Fat Po tells him the man was sent by Frank and Ip decides to confront Frank in his office. Frank gives him a chance. If he can remain standing after fighting him for three minutes he will back off of the school. The clock starts, the two spar back and forth and when the timer rings, Ip Man has survived and Frank honors his promise.All would seem to end her but it doesn't. Cheung Tin-chi has opened his school but still needs students. To gain attention for his form of Wing Chun he challenges Ip Man to a match. With his wife so close to death Ip Man turns down the match, instead learning how to dance like his wife always wanted and taught by young dance instructor Bruce Lee.When she learns that Ip Man turned down the match to spend time with her, his wife contacts Cheung Tin-chi and she request a rematch. He agrees and the two face off for the match that so many were waiting to see.It seems that these movies always follow a pattern of culminating in a final fight and that's fine. With each film they attempt to outdo the previous film and they have achieved that. This time around it also led to a sequel of sorts involving Cheung Tin-chi in a film of his own.One again the combination of history and story meld here quite well, perhaps not quite as well as in the previous two efforts. This time around it feels less about the personal story of Ip Man and more about what was transpiring in Hong Kong at the time. It still makes for an entertaining film that holds your interest from start to finish. It also finally brings Bruce Lee into the story, returning to him at the end and what was meant by the open door.Made in 2015, seven years after the first film, Donnie Yen shows no signs of aging. He moves with the same speed here that he did then. Some will claim that this is due to stunt men but my guess is that most of what you see on screen is indeed Yen. My biggest wish would be to see him making more mainstream movies here in the states but he seems content to make movies in China. In the end it doesn't matter as no matter where he makes film they are always enjoyable and worth watching."
" So-so finale
",0.0,0.229,2020-06-03 00:00:00,6,"Unlike the previous Ip Man instalments, the story of this film felt a little too contrived. While the previous films had a grounded historical feel, this one was more like a typical melodramatic Asian movie plot with one-dimensional gangster villains, a feel-good story arc and some cheap ""think of the children!"" elements. To be honest, it was not bad. It just did not fit in well with its predecessors."
" Awesome fights with some poignant drama albeit a messy plot
",-0.0258,0.9889,2020-05-30 00:00:00,7,"When I first watched this movie, I remember not liking it and feeling rather disappointed with it which is the opposite of how I felt when I watched IP Man 2. However, after re-watching this movie I came out rather appreciating it and enjoying it way more than I expected.Sammo Hung who was the action director of the first two IP Man film does not return for the third one. Instead, IP Man 3 has Woo-Ping Yuen as the new action director who has a lot of martial art movies to his belt such as Kung fu Hustle and Kill Bill so the action was still in safe hands. One of the things I felt about IP Man 2 that was rather off-putting was the very cartoony style of fighting and overuse of wire works. I can safely say that in IP Man 3 it returns to the more grounded and realistic style of the first movie.This movie also expands upon the use of environments for the action scenes. Ip Man fights a dozen men on a stair, fights in a construction area and fights a Muay Thai boxer in a claustrophobic elevator. Rather than just be open areas like the first movie, this movie incorporates different environments to create very unique fight scenes. For example, IP Man uses the hand rails during the stair fight or having him protect his wife during the conflict within the small area of the elevator. It's very creative and also very exhilarating fight scenes. One of the biggest advertisement for this movie was IP Man's fight against Frank played by Mike Tyson and despite being just 3 minutes, the fight is still really amazing. While in IP Man 1 he was invincible and there was no threat in the fights and in IP Man 2 where he actually fought physically struggling fights, IP Man 3 does something different. IP Man is still rather invincible in the fights but its the meaning to these fights that are the real suspense. It's a very interesting way of keeping IP Man as the all-mighty superhero but still, make it seem like he is genuinely in trouble in these fights.There is also a very interesting rival and antagonist for IP Man in Zhang Jin as Cheung Tin-chi who is also a Wing Chun user. It's not like a lot of the movies in which the antagonist is like the main character but evil, Cheung Tin has a lot of depth to him. He will protect innocent people like IP Man and has someone he cares about but is a lot more aggressive compared to IP Man. Zhang Jin and the action director manages to show this contrast by having IP Man fight with more elegance whereas Cheung Tin with more ferocity even though they use the same fighting style. Cheung Tin is also very sympathetic in that he doesn't get the same respect and recognition as IP Man even when he does a good deed and it plays a part in his jealousy towards IP Man which eventually builds up to an awesome climax fight scene. He is a very interesting character and it is no surprise that he eventually gets his own spinoff movie.Ip Man himself still manages to get his own character arc in this movie in which the major focus is his relationship with his wife Cheung Wing-sing (Lynn Hung). IP Man throughout the first two movies was mostly calm, modest and restraint but in this movie, we get to see more emotions from him as he has a vastly different struggle compared to the previous two movies. In IP Man 1 he struggled with surviving WWII and in the second movie, he struggled with adapting and physically struggled in fights. In IP Man 3 the struggle is mostly dealing with his fame and his wife's cancer. Unlike the second film where there is a problem, he can fight directly, in IP Man 3 the problem can't be solved by fighting. It gives IP Man a unique character arc in which he doesn't come out by the end of the movie better than before but gaining a new perspective and lesson on what is most important in life. It's why I really enjoyed the second half of this movie with its more emotional scenes which is praise given to Donnie Yen for giving a great performance in these heart wrenching moments.While the second half was great, the first half is not so much. The first half is about dealing with a triad gang working for the antagonist Frank played by Mike Tyson. Firstly, Mike Tyson is not an actor and it really shows in his really cheesy performance. It's even more gear grinding when they make him speak Cantonese and it is just really bad. Secondly, his character is never really explored even though he is the main antagonist for the first half. They don't explain his origins or his motivations whatsoever. It gets really dumb when this whole gang fiasco gets magically resolved somehow by IP Man engaging in a fistfight with Frank which contrasts the whole theme of the second half. It doesn't make any sense but it all just gets resolved and brushed under the rug with no one ever talking about it at all in the second half.There is also this plot thread about Tsui Lik (Louis Cheung) who is a student of IP Man who has feelings for this school teacher which amounts to nothing. It doesn't add anything to the overall narrative but somehow was put in the movie to just pad time. His relationship with IP Man isn't even explored. The plot is stitched together poorly with a bunch of different plot lines somehow all connecting. Cheung's jealously, Triad leader being a student of some martial art master, police corruption, foreigners being in control, Frank in general, Ip Man's wife, Tsui Lik crush are all stitched together in the first half to create a very messy plot which just doesn't work. Thankfully the second half is more focused and consistent.I also have a little nitpick with how unconnected this movie feels to its prequels. Ip Man's friend and previously bandit but now fisherman friend is nowhere to be seen or mentioned at all in this movie even though it is still set in Hong Kong. There are returning characters such as Fat Po (Kent Cheng ) who has relative importance and Master Law (Lo Mang) who is just a cameo. However, everyone else feels completely different such as the reporters and Tin Ngo-san (Bryan Leung) who is a martial art master with a great and long friendship with IP Man but who wasn't in previous movies so it just feels really weird. IP Man 2 showed how difficult it is to be martial art master in Hong Kong but I guess its all easier now or something since Cheung Tin seems to be able to start one with ease. One of the things I loved from the second movie was his relationship with Leung, his first student, but sadly he is nowhere to be seen or mentioned and is instead replaced with a forgettable character Tsui Lik who does nothing for the movie. Bruce Lee (Danny Chan) is in the movie but mostly as a cameo for how Ip Man ends up teaching him rather than exploring their relationship which is a shame.Overall, I still enjoyed this movie a lot. A majority of the problem with this movie is, unfortunately, all in the first 50 minutes but the second half is masterfully done that I almost forgive it. Even in the messy first half, the fights are still exciting and thrilling to watch. This is a good martial art movie and was a very satisfying conclusion to the IP Man saga before they decided to make one more. I enjoyed it more than I expected and the fact it took risk is something I can appreciate. It's not as bad as many say it is and I think there is a lot of good in it."
" This movie has touched my heart Another great movie in ip man series probably a lil bit greater.
",0.765,0.9896,2020-05-18 00:00:00,9,"I've been watching many Chinese action movies since my childhood nd obviously just like the others my favorite Chinese action hero is Jackie Chan but now I can say not only Jackie Chan! Donnie yen just looking better nd better in every ip man movie it seems like Donnie isn't playing the role he's master Ip man in fact everyone did good job. I remember while I was watching the movie I just cried a lil bit although I'm not a very sensitive guy. Over all I can say with a good story, some great action and emotional scenes it's a award winning movie nd I ❤ this."
" Masterpiece as the first one
",0.6249,0.9611,2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed the third Ip's man movie. This one is better than the second one and more original, touching, and with great additions like Mike Tyson. Acting, choreographies and music as always amazing."
" At least the action is still good
",0.4404,0.9707,2020-04-30 00:00:00,6,"The first and second Ip Man movies certainly weren't masterpieces, but they did have solid/followable plots with a satisfying, logical progression, all supporting very good action scenes.This third instalment maintains the very good action scenes but takes a bit of a nosedive when it comes to plot, having about 2-3 movie's worth of narrative crammed into the one movie. I didn't buy the rivalry between Ip Man and the main villain. Also, it was unclear why in one scene near the end Ip Man seemed okay with using deadly weapons, despite refraining from using them in the series up until that point. But like I said, the action is still a good deal of fun, and I am looking forward to seeing how the series concludes in Ip Man 4."
" Not as good as the first two, but still pretty good
",0.125,0.8075,2020-04-21 00:00:00,6,"Due to it's very unfocused plot, this is not as good as either of the first two.However, it has a lot of brilliant dramatic moments that are better than many scenes from the previous movies.Donnie Yen's still a badass, the action is still great and it gave us Donnie Yen vs. Mike Tyson, which is just too awesome to dislike."
" Something different...
",0.0,-0.5267,2020-04-20 00:00:00,7,"""Yip Man 3"" is a Biography - Drama movie and the third movie of the Yip Man saga in which we watch Ip Man defending some locals from a gangster group which want to take a local school by force.If you have already watched the two previous Yip Man movies then I believe that you will be disappointed by it. In my opinion ""Yip Man 3"" is a very good movie with many hidden details laying all over it but it's very different from the previous two movies and this is its disadvantage. Many people expected it to be just another Yip Man movie in which there will by many fights and nothing more. Well, this movie is something more than this and it would be better for you to be prepared for it before watching it."
" Great martial arts film although the plot could have been tighter.
",0.6249,-0.1932,2020-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Another great martial arts movie with a plot that focuses on the politics of the time. The plot isn't as tight as it could have been with 2 villains and a very emotional sub-plot, but the fight scenes are great and the style of combat is entertaining to watch. Not as funny as the others and having Mike Tyson in it was a bit odd, as is their general attitude and culture surrounding martial arts."
" Xiaolongbao! Writing was like mixing wonton soup with soursop
",0.4199,0.7184,2020-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Was this 2 movies mashed together as one, or did Mike Tyson pay big bucks last minute to be added to the script? The story just didn't make sense. Nevertheless and as always, excellent choreography, directing and acting. I just wish the writing was tighter without the plot and technical issues."
" Max Zhang Steals The Show
",-0.5106,0.9807,2020-02-16 00:00:00,6,"What elevates this film from being a rather lackluster sequel to a watchable one is the other Wing Chun master played by Max Zhang. His character is interesting and is given some depth, not to mention that he is great in the fight sequences. The story this time around is far from the best but Donnie still plays his role well and the fights are not too bad though far from Yuen Woo Ping's best work. All in all you should watch this one if you are a Wing Chun film fan and to witness Max Zhang's cool character.It gets 6 out of 10 Wing Chun Masters from me!"
" Definitely some potential
",0.4019,0.9943,2020-02-02 00:00:00,6,"I find this movie frustrating because in some aspects I find it very pleasant, but some potential stays untapped.
First of all, the evolution of the story is all over the place. I don't understand the point with this school and the focus put on the gangsta squad. Sure, the character of Cheung-tin-chi had to be introduced, but there are so many better ways to introduce and develop such a character. The clash between traditional and less conventional kung fu are interesting, as well as the one about the time Ip man spends training and sharing with his family. But all these storylines make it impossible to develop properly these ideas and it leaves a bitter taste at the end.
Added to that, they have that habit to attack one character at the time in the fight scenes with larger groups. How do you want to take the characters seriously in a dangerous situation when they could have been taken down 10 times during the fight scenes, hadn't the ennemies been so kind. That's a recurrent flaws in action movies, but one I definitely wish to see less in the future.
The films focuses more on the family of Ip man and that's fine, although this topic isn't developed as much as it could. I enjoyed this approach to the character.
Cheung Tin Chi is an interesting ""villain"" and could have been more developed. Glad they decided to make a film about him though. This is clearly the most interesting opponent to ip man so far.
One-to-one fight scenes are good, well choregraphed and well directed. Actors are in general good and convincing. I also like the visuals of this movie. They are usually sober, but beautiful and there is a lot of work with the colors that you see on screen. Nice job on that one.
So, this is definitely not the best of the ip man, but it is far form being a catastrophy. It's a decent sequel."

",0.6369,0.7688,2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,The best story with more of an emotional edge as well as some phenomenal fight scenes including the iconic elevator scene. Possibly a new entrant into my top 10 films of all time!

" A bit dull and running out of ideas
",-0.4019,0.9879,2019-04-11 00:00:00,5,"For me, the first Ip Man movie is probably the best martial arts film of the modern age. The production design, the cinematography, the acting, and the absolutely stunning choreography by Samo Hung is just mind blowingly good.The seque -l Ip Man 2 was a good time but just not ""quite"" as good.This third sequel takes a bit of a turn for the worse. It's kind of dull tbh and felt a bit stock and forced.I am loath to say this, but the choreography is nowhere near as good as the previous two films. Samo Hung did not return to choreograph this film and so the job fell to legendary martial arts coordinator Yuen Woo Ping, but compared to the other Ip Man films his style of choreography seems dated and much less dynamic. It's even cheesy in places with some unrealistic wire work clogging up the flow. I say all this as a life long fan of Yuen Woo Ping, but the truth is that it's just not as good as either the previous Ip man films or Yuen's past films of his own that he has directed and choreographed.It's not absolutely awful though. It still looks quite pretty and it's cool seeing Mike Tyson in a role, but you can tell that this film was made out of demand and that they were running out of ideas by now.Worth a watch for sure, but it's a by the numbers Kung-Fu film compared to the others."

" ""The world doesn't belong to the rich, or even the powerful, but to those of pure heart.""
",0.4939,-0.9655,2019-02-14 00:00:00,7,"I've seen the first two 'Ip Man' films with Donnie Chen in the title role, so with that said, this story felt like more of the same. What I mean is, there's an antagonist set up to challenge the Wing Chun master, and the fighting eventually involves a street brawl in which Ip Man takes on a veritable crowd of martial artists without too much of a problem. That takes realism right out of the story for me, as the mechanics of something like that are well nigh impossible. Interestingly, Ip Man has two principle foes in the story, a thug who terrorizes the local school with his band of rowdies, and an aspiring Wing Chun master who wants to prove his superiority over Ip Man. The first is dispatched rather handily by his own boss, portrayed by former boxer Mike Tyson in a role in which he seems a bit out of his element. What's somewhat different in this story is the focus on Ip Man's personal life and relationship with his wife and son. When he learns of Madame Ip's (Lynn Xiong ) cancer, Ip Man retreats from his duties at the school and spends more quality time with her, ignoring a challenge match with Cheung Tin-chi (Jin Zhang). The most impressive physical confrontation in the picture for me was the broad-knife fight between Ip man and Cheung, brought on by Madame Ip's secretly placed message to Cheung's son. It was convincingly well choreographed and looked incredibly dangerous, if in fact real weapons were being used. The picture ends on a somber note with the death of Madame Ip succumbing to her disease, thereby inserting some pathos to the career of the man recognized as the Master of Wing Chun style."
" A selective story
",0.0,0.9721,2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,"This review contains spoilers.Ip Man 3 is a biographical martial arts movie. The movie is the sequel to Ip Man 2. The movie reprises Donnie Yen as in the role of Ip Man and continues looking at the life of Ip Man. The movie introduces Ip Man's rivals as well as Ip Man's future pupil in Bruce Lee. The movie looks at Ip Man as he lives in Hong Kong.The third movie takes after the second movie in many ways. The movie does not have that tight survival focus that the first movie did. Much like the second movie the focus is more on Ip Man and his expansion of Wing Chun. This movie feels more like an episode of Ip Man's life rather than a full fledged movie. This is not a bad thing as the movie has many good qualities.The fights in this movie are great to watch. One of the highlights is a fight between Ip Man and Frank played by Mike Tyson. The fight is impressive and interesting to watch. The only disappointment is seeing no resolution to the fight. The movie's fights in general are impressive to watch. This is a running theme across all of the movies as all of them are choreographed well and have interesting qualities in all of the fight scenes. All of the scenes have a beautiful quality to them.The main problem with this movie is that much of the plot feels contrived. Watching this movie's story feels like the filmmakers had run out of ideas while also needing to satisfy a western andience. Ip Man gets into many conflicts that the movie simply throws at him. He is able to overcome all of these except for the death of his wife. This was the only well executed part of the story. The other plot areas feel as if they were dropped onto Ip Man.This movie absolutely suffers from pacing. None of the story areas, except for Ip Man's wife felt like they fit into the story well. It seemed more like the movie needed to fulfill requirements rather than craft an artwork. This is something that the other movies did better.I would still recommend 'Ip Man 3'.Grade: B"
" the story of IP man continues
",0.0,0.9399,2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that just because someone choses not to fight doesn't mean that aren't more than willing to come out of retirement in order to help the people important to them. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.

" good movie and action scenes
",0.4404,0.9285,2017-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Ip Man 3 is the third movie about Ip Man, who is interpreted by Donnie Yen. I really enjoyed the movie because it is not only action and fights, rather it also focuses on Ip Man's private life with his family and wife in particular. Furthermore, I also liked how the fight scenes were made, above all the one Wing Chun v Wing Chun. So, in the third movie we see that Ip Man can fight and win against other Chinese martial arts such as Wing Chun, Thai box and box.I would have given 10, but I expected a better use of Mike Tyson. I think he should have been given more space and a better fight against Donnie Yen. In fact, their fight only lasts 3 minutes and after it, he is not seen anymore in the movie.In conclusion, I really loved this movie and I hope they will continue to make movies about Ip Man."
" Overall good series but with some mistakes...
",0.2382,0.8374,2017-03-13 00:00:00,9,"Ip man 3 was overall a good movie and was also a continuity to the previous series. In Ip man (2008) he was wealthy and had a good reputation in Foshan but after the Japanese overtook Foshan Ip man lost everything except his family and reputation. After defeating Japanese general he flee to Hongkong to start a new life by starting a school. In Ip man 2 (2010) he still faced hardships but continued his struggle to live on and build up his reputation in Hongkong among other masters. After defeating the western boxer he earned the respect of other masters. In Ip man 3 (2015) he was showed living a good life as he lived in Foshan. But still each and every place has a hero and a villain. And this time he has to face gangsters to save the school from being overtook by them. And a western was behind it with whom Ip man settled score himself.But there are some blunders made by film-makers. First, Ip Ching (Ip man's second son) was born in Foshan too in 1936, not in Hongkong in 1950. Second, Ip Ching was not even shown/introduced in Ip man 3 like he was never even born. Third, Ip man was in police as described in his bio but not according to the movie. There might be some other mistakes too but i just figured these out.I am not criticizing. I you people think so then i apologize."
" Old Clichés Seen Through a Modern Lens
",0.0,-0.9328,2017-02-01 00:00:00,5,"This will be a short review, because it's easy to summarize the good and no-so-good aspects of this movie.The acting is good ⎯ better than typical Hollywood fare. The cinematography is excellent.The plot is quite predictable. That's not a major gripe, since I mostly watch martial arts movies for the skill of the fighters and cleverness of the choreography. It's like a kind of violent ballet when done well. But this plot lazily borrows from movies from decades ago and doesn't improve on them.Speaking of fighting, the fight choreography is okay. I expected better. The one-on-one sequences in the second half of the movie are very good. However, the multi-person fights aren't so great. You get a lot of the cliché of a group of bad guys attacking mostly one at a time with the others busting a move in the background while waiting their turn. Plus, the fighting concepts themselves are a bit repetitious. I have definitely seen far more imagination given to fight sequences and especially use of the set during the fight. The same things have been done better in other movies. Another issue with this movie was its inaccurate depiction of certain aspects of the period. The biggest problem was that they've taken modern views, concerns, and male-female interactions and injected them into a movie set in a much different time. Younger people may not pick up on this much, if at all, but when you're aware of the social mores of the day the mistakes stand out like a fart at a funeral. So, what you have is a well-filmed movie with so-so fighting, predictable plot, and unrealistic characterizations. It could have been much better ⎯ like the first Ip Man movie, for example."
" Nope Man
",0.0,0.3729,2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"The movie would have been great with a re-ordered story. Having the main villain, Tyson, give up 3/4 through the movie rendered the remaining 1/4 moot.Yes, the movie is really about a guy cherishing his loved ones. Tyson gave up because he cherished his daughter and wife more than he wanted land and fortune. That was symbolized by the balloon. ""We can get another balloon"" is Tyson saying ""I can buy other land"". His family was more important to him than continuing the war with a guy who was his equal.But that should have been the end of the movie.Because the main villain was dispatched early, the fight with the other master seemed meaningless. It was like a second movie."
