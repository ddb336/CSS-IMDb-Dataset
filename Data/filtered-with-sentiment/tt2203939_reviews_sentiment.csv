" ""9 to 5"" on steroids! An extreme chick flick!
",0.0,0.4558,2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,"The latest in a series of 'women getting even with their chauvinistic boss, husband who dumped them, or cheating husband' films. A number of reviews mention the likeness of this film to ""The First Wives Club"", of 18 years previous to this film. Again, there are 3 women who band together to get revenge against badly behaving men. But I didn't happen to see any reviews that mentioned it's likeness to the the grandmother of these types of films: 1980's ""9 to 5"". Again , we had 3 women who banded together to punish a man behaving badly toward them. In that case, it was their chauvinistic boss. In the present film, it is a cheating husband. For much of the film, it's knockout girlfriend Cameron Diaz and beautiful wife Leslie Mann as an unlikely 40sh buddy pair. Eventually, they are joined by newest girlfriend: 20sh beautiful Kate Upton, who takes the place of Dolly Parson, in ""9 to 5"", in the sense of one notable physical asset, although she hardly takes her place as a personality and actress. ............I noticed that, of these 3 films, '9 to 5"" has the highest mean reviewer rating, although the fewest reviews(probably because it is much older), while the present film has the lowest mean reviewer rating, but the most reviews. From my rather brief scanning of the written reviews, each of these films has probably a sizable majority of 8,9, and especially 10 ratings, and many of the 7s said they loved it. On the other hand, there were also quite a few 1s and 2s for the present film, and ""The First Wives Club"" film. In contrast, there was only the occasional 1 or 2 rating for ""9 to 5"", thus explaining it's higher mean reviewer rating. In regard to the present film, clearly, the vast majority either loved it or hated it, with few in the middle. I would love to know the sex ratios of those who gave it a 1 or 2, vs. of those who gave it a 8, 9, or 10! Despite being a man, I fall in the latter group, with a more qualified opinion than the most enthusiastic writers. I hope some other men also fall into this category........... Some object to the excesses the women went to to punish the cheating man. But, at least they are more imaginative than conking him with a frying pan, or arranging for his imminent death. I will say that I don't think of myself as a male chauvinist, I haven't dumped my wife for a younger model (But perhaps that's only because my only wife is 21 years younger than I?), and I haven't cheated on my wife of 32 years.(Thus, I must be a rather dull fellow, eh?). Thus, I can laugh at abuse heaped on these stereotypes without feeling guilty."
" A wine and popcorn type of movie

This is a 2014 film that I am still scrolling back to watch in 2021. This is just how women should unite but I will settle for the revenge on the screen and loads of laughter!!

" Nice to watch but superficial humor
",0.5499,0.9637,2020-11-14 00:00:00,6,"A funny, entertaining, but completely exaggerated and not to be taken very seriously comedy. Perfect for an evening with lots of beer and wine and friends. superficial humor but nice to look at"
" Bemused?
",0.0,0.6428,2020-11-13 00:00:00,3,I often complain European comedies are under rated on IMDB by US reviewers. We have a sly and wry humour that is often under appreciated elsewhere. This film is an example of the reverse happening - I just don't get how we are expected to like or believe in any of these characters. I understand we suspend disbelief blah blah.. but I have never even seen a human being the shape of Nicki Minaj let alone seen characters like she and Cameron Diaz play working in an office like that. I hate them all too much to bear watching a moment longer.

There are so many funny lines and my family are on stitches!Lesley Mann is amazing in this! I fee that some reviewers take her character's situation so literally and like real life, and yes, we all know that cheating happens, but this is a feel good film, and her goofiness is what makes it incredible!And maybe Kate Upton's acting could be a little better, but people really need to lighten up and see this movie as the hilarious chick flick it really is!"
" Brilliant chick flick feel good comedy
",0.8481,0.9722,2020-04-16 00:00:00,10,I absolutely loved this movie! It's a classic chick flick feel good comedy with tons of funny scenes. I have watched this movie tons of times and enjoy it every time! Definitely give it a watch! Brilliant actresses too.
" Hillarious
",0.0,0.8176,2020-02-16 00:00:00,7,"The Other Woman is surprisingly humorous, ironic and entertaining. A unique concept to see a group of women team up against a habitual cheater. Funny film from start to finish and some good chemistry that really shows. 7/10"
" Dreadful
",-0.4404,0.9249,2020-02-04 00:00:00,1,"I expected a lot more from this film as it sounded like it could be fun especially with Cameron Diaz starring in it.I usually like her films.
To start with the film looked promising at first' a naive woman dating a man who is a serial cheater.She finds him out when she decides to turn up at his house hoping to give him a nice surprise but instead is greeted by a woman at the door who tells him she is his wife.
Okay so far so good but then suddenly the film takes a drastic turn for the worse.
The wife Kate turns up at Carly(Cameron Diaz) work place and starts to act over emotional causing a spectacle of herself.This is i believe supposed to be a funny scene but instead is so over the top and to say over acted would be an understatement .At this point it looks like Cameron Diaz was desperately trying to save the film as she is still giving a realistic performance.
But the film gets worse as the next scene is when the wife Kate goes out for a heart to heart drink with Carly only to get legless and again act well over the top.The Kate character is so annoying and irritating that it becomes of no surprise that the husband was cheating on her.The actress plays the character with far too much over confidence that you feel like you are being forced into finding her character funny.And i for one did not.And her painfully thin figure was painful to see.I saw other reviews that criticized the Amber character of being too chubby Really? i know whose figure i would prefer to have.Hollywood anything under a size 8 is not attractive.
I could go on about this film but what is the point its cliched in girl power and not in a good way.
Towards the end of the film the cheating husband Mark walks into a glass room that literally shatters all over the place.How is this even possible ?wouldnt this glass have been health and safety checked so that this wasnt possible.
If you are into over the top acted cliche comedies then this may be for you otherwise avoid like i wished i had"
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.6592,2019-12-27 00:00:00,8,"It was the day after Christmas, and I wanted something light and funny. This was perfect for that. The hubby didn't like it, but oh well."
" The Ultimate Break Up Movie!!
",0.0,0.9594,2019-12-23 00:00:00,10,"This review is long overdue. When I was going threw a break up, I remember coming across this movie, and I was at all time low. This movie made me laugh and help me understand that there is nothing wrong with me, that sometimes it is the other person.Now every time I'm at a low I pop this movie in and helps me out of my depression.All three stars shine and give the most believable performances. This is why I LOVE this movie. It's the acting and the emotions displayed by Cameron, Kate and Leslie this keep watching it over again for years to come.I 100% recommend this movie to ANYONE who is going through a breakup or even at a low in their life. This movie will make you laugh and feel good about yourself cause no one should have the power to tear you down!"
" I love this movie!
",0.6696,0.8313,2019-12-21 00:00:00,9,This film deserves way higher than a 6! This is such a fun girls movie. Maybe the best girl power movie I've seen
" Genuinely funny
",0.4404,0.4587,2019-12-10 00:00:00,10,"I went in with extremely low expectations, and was blown away.Leslie Mann is on fire in this thing, carrying it emotionally and doing her finest comedic work as well, and Cameron Diaz is legit one of the top people in the comedy game!Funnier (and better) than Devil Wears Prada, and almost on par with Bridesmaids, THIS is one of the funniest female driven comedies of all time, and I will gladly die on that hill."
" YES!!!!!
",0.0,0.93,2019-11-16 00:00:00,7,"Here is some great comedy. You have Kate Upton, Cameron Diaz, and that other weird motherly lady. Together in a movie, they are perfect.I like the bond the woman shared. It starts as conflict, but eventually it becomes forced, before becoming casual and friendly. They are all after the same guy, and who doesn't like a player. A great revenge comedy with three hot blondes.7 stars"

" A ""Chick Flick"" with Substance
",0.0,0.9959,2019-06-07 00:00:00,9,"This movie is different from the rest, and even my husband likes it and laughs a ton throughout when, let's face it, guys aren't usually much for these types. But the point is, it's a movie that already has a different plot and little twists that others with the same theme do not and the best part is that it has substance.It's a great message of women supporting women and how much it means to have true friends and it really makes you want to strive to have those kinds of relationships. The comedy is pretty darn good, with original jokes and good comedic timing by all, especially as the film draws to a close. It's so funny I usually have to grab whoever's next to me in preparation for the laughs. The acting is also really good, the setting perfect, and Don Johnson absolutely the best!
A solid 9/10 for me!"
" Silly and strong
",0.5267,0.8761,2019-05-24 00:00:00,10,"Great laughs and a great concept. Too often the cuckold lashes out at the equally ignorant mistress. It's refreshing to see the women band together and form such a strong bond. The villain really is a super-creep too, so you don't really form a bond to him. Cameron Diaz is strong and plays the alpha well, which I found surprising. Leslie Mann is perfection, per usual. The only bad part of the movie is Nicki Minaj but her part is extremely small. Overall, a fun way to spend a few hours and a great message for women who are afraid to leave a bad relationship. There is life after heartbreak!"
" Somebody Made Money Off This Fiasco

" Garbage
",0.0,-0.4907,2019-05-06 00:00:00,1,"Witless, unfunny and badly acted, I can't think of a worse move in 2014. The plot seems to pander to the lowest common denominator and the humor is childish and immature. Leslie Mann's character is intensely irritating and I hope Nicki Minaj and Kate Upton stick to their other jobs in future - neither was any good. The only funny part was Don Johnson still trying to act the tough guy - unintentionally hilarious. Overall though, this movie is an absolute stinker."
" hard to admire, unenjoyable
",0.4019,-0.9476,2019-02-13 00:00:00,6,"A misguided and horrible excuse for a female empowerment film, The Other Woman is a comedy that makes women look terrible and is absolutely miserable to watch, with horrendous performances, painfully unfunny attempts at humor, and poor writing."
" Pathetic
",-0.5719,0.4767,2019-01-11 00:00:00,1,"If a movie was made about a husband and two other guys with whom his wife had been sleeping with, who then team up, become the best of buddies, and go around high fiving each other as they proceed to play vengeful childish pranks on this now unsuspecting woman by giving her an overdose of laxatives, dipping her toothbrush in a toilet, forcing her to get molested by a transexual, and secretly getting her to injest testosterone causing her to grow facial hair, I'd say to myself ""what a bunch of pathetic losers"".The same applies here.Just how any of this movie was even remotely funny is beyond me."

The three women form a sisterhood making me feel like I was watching a ""Sex in the City"" episode. Together they conspire to ""hurt"" Mark.The movie is a chick flick. Cameron Diaz is not the spry Charlies' Angel anymore. Leslie Mann plays an unrealistic character that was fun to watch. And Kate Upton ran in slow motion in a white bikini. This was a fun formulaic film that is not deep. Good sound track helped in the enjoyment.Parental Guide: No nudity. 2 mouthed f-bombs. Sex talk"

The movie itself, not so much... Leslie Mann as the deceived wife is extremely annoying and gross; up to the point that I thought the movie was going to be about her realization of how unpleasantness is not the best way to keep your husband's love. A number of dubiously original or amusing gags ensue to her discovery of 'the other woman' - aka Cameron Diaz in a refreshingly mature and sedated role-; including dipping the husband's toothbrush in urine and mixing his food with copious amounts of estrogen AND a laxative; which in my book classifies at attempt poisoning and not just an amusing way of getting payback. It takes a really bad movie to make a feminist like me kinda empathize with a cheating man; this one achieved it!"

Involuntarily alter his body by overdosing his drinks with female hormones.Dilute his shampoo with hair removing cream, causing him to lose his hair.Flush his toothbrush in the toilet...Pour dangerous amounts of laxative into his drink at a restaurant.Have a drag queen sexually assault him without consent.All the while, the women are portrayed as strong supportive characters, with a cringey slow-motion beach shot where they all hold each other as if to say 'yeah girl power! we're all in this cruel vendetta until the end!'.After the slew of assaults upon his person, they climax by confronting him, causing him to have a nervous breakdown, and they literally stand around watching as he breaks his nose and then trips into a glass pane that shatters and cuts him up. They literally just stand there watching. Nobody offers to check if he's okay or call an ambulance. I guess that's okay because he's a man.The worse thing about this movie is that it is NOT a good portrayal of women, and there is something seriously wrong with society if we do find this funny."

I didn't want to think to hard, needed an escape and wanted something without violence. Must be why they continue to make these silly movies.Cameron Diaz discovers that the man she's been dating is married and teams up with his wife (Leslie Mann) and another mistress (Kate Upton) to destroy his career and teach him a humiliating lesson in fidelity.Oh, and where has Don Johnson been hiding?

" Hilarious comedy
",0.6369,0.6542,2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,This is one of the funniest films ever. Leslie Mann is a comedy genius and is at her best here as the insecure wife who finds out that her husband is enjoying affairs. Cameron Diaz is very good as a woman who finds out that she's one of his mistresses.The reason I'm not giving it a 10 is that the first several minutes are bad. The opening song is so bad that it's painful to listen to. What looks like it's going to be a sex scene turns out not to happen. The first conversations (between the man and Diaz's character and between him and his wife) are boring.Don't let the bad start put you off - it gets really good as soon as the wife and Diaz's character meet.

The wife finds out and the two start on a tempestuous relationship.I watched this with my girlfriend and was prepared to catch a sneaky nap. But I enjoyed it greatly. I find that some films with similar plots to this tend to be man-hating revenge flick with some awful jokes squeezed in.This is a much more rounded affair. The female characters are flawed, but non-typical. I found a lot of the jokes worked and the physical humour landed well. This came to a satisfying conclusion and I was rooting for the women all the way through."

Every cliché in the book from the bloody annoying largest dog they could find to any opportunity to do some kind of faux girlie intoxicated squabble involving lots of garbled script. the sole thing that kept me from turning it off was to see what kind of clichéd comeuppance the two-timing husband was going to get. It certainly didn't disappoint, the ending was predictably bland. All the girls having seen off the scheming husband end up in clover one way or the other, the antihero presumably on skid row. I don't blame the acting, except Niki Minaj.....what was all that about, why was she even in this film...the guilty party was the director who's supposed to be in charge....dreadful."
