" Stereotype after stereotype to make dumb people even dumber
",-0.8555,-0.8166,2020-11-30 00:00:00,2,"When you though you had seen all Hollywood stupid movies, then we got this. The big mystery is how they got so many famous actors to be part of this crap of script.
Not a drama, not a comedy, not an action movie. Just stupidity."
" A film with potential that doesn't quite achieve what it could have
",0.0,-0.5859,2020-09-07 00:00:00,5,"Richie Lanz (Bill Murray) is an agent for musical talent. Based in LA, he has fallen on hard times. He decides to take one act he has, who is also his PA (Zooey Deschanel) on a USO tour of Afghanistan. When she runs away after the first night with all his money and his passport he is left stranded. He becomes involved with gun running to make a quick buck and receives unlikely help from a prostitute (Kate Hudson). One day he hears the singing voice of a young Pashtun tribal woman (Leem Labany) and convinces her to go to Kabul with him to appear in the TV talent show, 'Afghan Star'.Using the real life story of Setara Hussainzada who became a sensation and pariah in Afghanistan after appearing on the Afghan equivalent of 'America/Britain's Got Talent', 'Afghan Star' as the basis this story, it fictionalises the story to be about a creeper who Murray seems to be unable to levitate to any higher level in what seems a less loveable rogue than in some of his better films. The chemistry between him and Kate Hudson's happy hooker character is also lacking. The film has potential, but sadly that all the elements fail to work can only be laid at director Barry Levinson's feet."
" Forget the negative reviews, and judge for yourself. You won't regret it.
",-0.5053,0.9562,2020-08-02 00:00:00,8,"Do what I do: forget the reviews and see a real good Bill Murray movie. I can not speak for Murray, but I feel I know why he thought this was worth doing, and if you are a true fan of Bill Murray's work, I promise you you won't be disappointed. It's not Stripes. It's not Groundhog Day. It's not Lost in Translation. But it takes you to a very controversial world ( for Americans) and gives you a Bill Murray (and Levinson) perspective which includes a very subtle humor and some realistic yet unstated commentary on another culture that we usually see only in caricature."
" Acting Is Great, But LOL Afghans Are Aryan People
",0.81,0.976,2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"Hollywood is so clueless about the world is a joke. Afghans are the original ARYAN people, not the racism aryan idiots but the original Aryan people. So why the hell would you cast Arab actors for AFGHANS LOL!!
Hollywood is sometimes an imbecilic mixed up mess of a joke. Nothing more hilarious in this movie then seeing Moroccan actors in an Arab village pretending they are in the mountains of central Asia. LOL!
The actors are great, the actress is amazing, great cast."
" A Hidden Classic To Be
",0.0,0.9337,2020-04-16 00:00:00,10,The music. The Story. The Comedy. The Truth. How have I not heard of this before. This movie is easily a hidden classic. The Stars in here. And they were Excellent. Bill was at his best. Bruce was classic. Just watch it.
" very funny and witty. Also, eye-opener to someone thats never served in the military.
",0.4927,0.9382,2020-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Classic Bill Murray. Awesome eye-opener to the daily life of an ancient proud people, their lack of freedom, and absence of liberties in this part of the Middle East. By the way, this allegedly takes place directly adjacent to the poppy fields in the region, which happens to be guarded by the CIA, and the locals alliance to US Troops guarding said fields. Kate Hudson's character wants to give up prostitution to become a real estate agent. The Code of Ethics for both professions is identical, as well as the CIA's and tribal members."
" Deep Sleeper ...
",0.0,0.9964,2020-03-09 00:00:00,10,"Know that I am a Bill Murray fan. From the moment he stepped into the national consciousness during his days on SNL to his first motion picture Meatballs to Where the Buffalo Roam, Caddyshack & his first *serious role* in Somerset Maugham's Razor's Edge ... through *Lost*, *The Life* & *Monuments*. Somehow this one never made my radar until I stumbled on it watching cable. Given Murray's rebellious nature and Hollywood's predominate non secular inclinations ... it's easy to see how this was released with little to no marketing fanfare. It is Murray playing Murray with his authentic dry, sardonic wit and style. It is also one of the first movies out of Hollywood that has delivered on its attempt to humanize Mid Eastern stereotypes in way that is simultaneously humorous and hopeful. As in Groundhog Day, his character's evolution begins with cynicism and indignation but through the story it finds heart and a raison d'etre. Kate Hudson is fabulous as his muse and *business partner* showing depth in her performance as a vehicle to illustrate Western dogmatic values regarding women as carefully balanced against Mid Eastern traditions as the basis of the conflict. I give it 10 because of the brilliant handling of deep subject matter and Murray's ability to humorously make the point that our values are simply different in a way that deserves close examination. As for Bruce Willis ... whom I've followed with interest since he stormed into the national consciousness on Moonlighting ... this was another smoothly cool character ... and his evolution too is worth following and reaches it's pinnacle when Murray asks him, ""Brian, you don't want to be the guy that left the Alamo ..."". There are so many great scenes and quote-worthy moments in this flick that you just have to see it to fully appreciate. Lastly ... the use of popular music ... from 2 of Cat Steven/Yusef Islam's best to Dylan's *Knocking on Heaven's Door* and even The Animal's *Don't let Me Be Misunderstood* ... all deftly inserted to align with the emotion of the scenes they are used in. Frankly this one is way underrated IMHO and I suspect it, like GHD will be a sleeper that ultimately transcends and catapults from cult to *classic* movie status. At least that is my hope ... there is a moral foundation that makes it worthwhile."
" Rock The Kasbah
",0.0,0.9385,2020-01-24 00:00:00,10,"Classic Bill Murray! He boast about his ability to find talent but is blown away when he finally does find it in Afghanistan. I loved this film! We need that ""Peace Train!"""
" A great, funny, smart and heartfelt film.
",0.9217,0.6249,2020-01-17 00:00:00,10,"This was an enjoyable film with Murray in a role as an optimistic, indomitable loser. The other characters added a lot of life to what was ultimately a fun film."
" Inspired by a true story
",0.7184,0.9072,2019-10-06 00:00:00,8,"Richie Lanz is a talent manager on hard times. When offered a USO tour to Afghanistan he takes it, but once there his talent steals his money, passport, and plane ticket home. While waiting for a new passport to be issued he is offered a lot of money for a day trip to a village to seal a deal. There he hears a woman singing.
While Richie spends the first half of the movie putting himself and talent through whatever it takes to make money. But when the time comes that he can save himself or live up to a deal made his altruism shines through.
While the story itself is complete fiction, it is inspired by and dedicated to a woman who sings on Afghanistan Star after the ban on Western music in Iran after the 1979."
" Not the worst Bill Murray film
",0.5096,0.628,2019-09-27 00:00:00,5,One of the worser but not horrible Bill Murray film. It had some laughs and boring plot but was watchable.
" Patronizing and Offensive
",-0.4588,-0.411,2019-04-15 00:00:00,1,"Here we we have the almighty white patriarch Bill Murray ready to correct people in their foreign land because if it's not the American way, than it's the wrong way. This makes ""Rock the Kasbah"" neither woken or progressive but offensive and tone deaf. Murray stars here as Richie Lanz, a conniving music agent from Los Angeles always on the lookout for new talent and rising stars even though he's past his prime. He cons a no-talent wannabe singer into having her pay him upfront even though she has a snowball's chance in microwave to ever be a successful singer. Following him on his journey is his assistant/girlfriend Ronnie (Zooey Deschanel) who's been gracious enough to work for him in hopes that her singing career could come into fruition. So he takes her on a trip to Kabul, Afghanistan to sing her heart out to the American troops, she ends up fearing the country (Islamophobia anyone?) she bails out on him in addition of stealing his wallet and his passports and leaving him in the lurch. But has turned a new leaf? Not in the least! In fact his predatory ways flourish as he tries to con a talented young Afghan girl named Salima (Leem Lubany) who has an angelic voice. He tries to get her to audition for ""Afghan Star"" (like Afghanistan's version of ""American Idol""). Only one problem, woman are forbidden from singing and she would bring shame from her family if she auditioned.I have always been a big fan of Bill Murray and even though he he doesn't always play likable characters, he has succeeded over the years adding charm and comedy levels to his roles giving them a spin with some sympathy to go along. Sadly ""Rock the Kasbah"" Lanz lacks in charm or likability but the fault mostly stems from the script by Mitch Glazer. Sure they seem to heavily support patriarchy by having Lanz painted as a white saviour as he selfishly patronizes these countrymen that their way is the wrong way and in an unnatural way, they listen to him. Speaking of Glazer, his script was inspired by a 2009 documentary ""Afghan Star"" about a real woman who appeared on that show and bravely broke barriers much to the chagrin of fans and conservative Muslims who have given her death threats and evicted her from her apartment. What Glazer and director Barry Levinson don't know was that women have auditioned for ""Afghan Star"" since its first airing in 2005 and so their arguments made about this movie is not completely justified. this was all just a ploy to make Lanz this holier than thou saviour who can save humanity by defying their rules and regulations just so that he can make a fortune off of this girl's angelic voice. Over the past few years Afghan women have made the efforts to overcome the hurdles regarding bigotry and sexism in their country and they never depended on a guy like Lanz to help them in their quests. But for the sake of entertainment manipulation, they inject a caricature like Lanz to be the patron saint for the greater good (which I say with the best of sarcasm). Salima is depicted here not as a character, but as a vocal piece for Lanz to speak out on moral justices in a country he doesn't even live in.If you want to understand the fundamentals of tone deaf, look no forward, this movie wrote the book on it. We have the cliched moronic weapons dealers (Scott Caan and Danny McBride). And of course the prostitute with the caring nature (Kate Hudson) who aren't the the ones put to the blame for why this film is so bad. They're just examples of how Americans regard themselves as they're always in the right when in reality it's not entirely true. All we see here Americans trying to one-up each other which is self-righteous and greedy. The movie is so convoluted in its patriarchy it's hard to be taken seriously. Hollywood needs to stop catering to American values and further examine the bigger picture by adding realism instead of phony American bias."
" How can do many good cast members make such a stinker?
",0.1027,0.6124,2019-04-13 00:00:00,2,"They should have called it the ""No Laugh Insult Fest"" , but they would have to add ""that peters out halfway through because everyone, including the cast and crew became overwhelmed with boredom.The writer and director of Rock the Kasbah parodies and insults every group in a avidly laughless way, while swerving away from any opportunity for character development. He reserves the particularly infantile, rascist parodies for locals in foreign countries. It's safe to assume that box office for Rock The Kasbah correlates pretty closely to the number of Confederate flag bumper stickers in cineplex parking lot.If you are a fan of Bill Murray, Zooey Deschanel, or Kate Hudson, don't see this movie. It will make you sad that they made such a stinker."
" It doesn't go anywhere
",0.0,-0.6122,2018-11-20 00:00:00,4,So boring and really not much happens. Not funny either
" Comedy, Music, War, Hope and Dreams
",0.4939,0.9118,2018-09-14 00:00:00,8,"I found this movie to be entertaining as well as inspirational. Bill Murray is good at his usual tongue in cheek dialog as a lying bull shirting motivational con man agent. Zooey Deschanel is gorgeous even when air sick and pill faced, and Kate Hudson is luscious many times over. Bruce Willis is good as a grizzled mercenary talking his memoirs during some of the road trips. Then there is Leem Lubany as Salima. It is difficult to imagine how hard it would be to live in a country or religious society where women are oppressed, not even allowed to pursue a dream under threat of death. It was inspiring to see her get to do it. It was great when Murray confessed all of his lies and Willis went along to help save the day. Was the story believable? Not really unless the stars are aligned perfectly or it is the hand of fate taking control in mysterious ways. 
But, that is why we have movies and books, they are better than real life. I rate it an 8/10 for the above reasons."
" All Talk, No Rock!
",-0.3595,0.8035,2017-09-18 00:00:00,3,"Barry Levinson is at his most underwhelming mode in 'Rock the Kasbah'. This Comedy is devoid of any big laughs & remains consistently dull. Only The Mighty Bill Murray keeps you going.'Rock the Kasbah' Synopsis: A down-on-his-luck music manager discovers a teenage girl with an extraordinary voice while on a music tour in Afghanistan and takes her to Kabul to compete on the popular television show, Afghan Star.'Rock the Kasbah' suffers from poor writing. Mitch Glazer's Screenplay makes no good use of its interesting premise. The Writing has no big laughs in store nor does it engage you. Gevinson's Direction is disappointing too. God Bless Bill Murray, who's game here & the ONLY reason why one would go through 'Rock the Kasbah' entirely. He's watchable & fun to watch, as always.On the whole, 'Rock the Kasbah' belies all the expectations."
" Uneven yet entertaining show
",0.4404,0.9844,2017-08-16 00:00:00,7,"Bill Murray almost always charms on screen with edgy comedic performances. (One exception is the much-touted ""Groundhog Day,"" which this watcher thought was as annoying as a repetitive chorus in a pop song, a repetitive chorus in a pop song, as annoying.) But ""Rock the Kasbah"" is one of Murray's more charming films. In it, he plays a touring music manager who discovers a female daring to vocalize by herself in a cave in Afghanistan -- the law there forbids women from singing, so of course Murray represents her. Alongside this story, which is based on actual events, is a somewhat forced and perfunctory sub-plot involving guns, drugs and extortion; this is contrary to the theme of music saving the world and seems at odds with the theme of gender equality. Otherwise, this movie is a lot of fun. The bonus is Kate Hudson as a hooker who takes a break from her work to assist Murray in representing the Afghan woman. Her best line is ""I fuc* like a mousekateer on crack"" and the vitality she brings to her performance elipses any damage done by the thoroughly vapid Zooey Deschanel. A peace-train-rockin' soundtrack and sharp cinematography help buoy the uneven and interesting story."
