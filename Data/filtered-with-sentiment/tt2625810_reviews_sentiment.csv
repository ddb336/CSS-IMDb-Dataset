" Flawed yet Beautiful in Moments
",0.5994,0.9535,2021-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Its easy to pile on the criticisms for this film. There are too many logical inconsistencies and moments where the viewer is made to suspend disbelief. For example, it always seems to be summer, The summer song birds heard throughout. They make mention of harsh winters, but there is no winter. Also, the timeline of the Rachael Evan Woods pregnancy makes no sense.All that said, the film has its own beauty. Cinematography is visually appealing. The performances by Ellen Page and Evan Wood are compelling. These are lovely and talented actresses. So, there a re a lot of problems here, but there is value in its beauty and escapist allure."
" An AMC Gremlin of a movie. A green one, with no AM Radio or AC.
",-0.296,0.5661,2021-03-26 00:00:00,1,"When Canadians set out to make a feature film, they...just shouldn't. Five minutes into this I was ready to chew off my own foot. Please stick to making snow, drinking keggers, and lumberjacking. These are things you, our plaid-jacketed northern cousins excel at. Look, Hollywood is bad enough cranking out their brainless, politically-correct schlock, so why contribute to that cinematic compost pile? Haven't we enough manure?"
" What a pathetic fim
",-0.5719,-0.956,2021-03-19 00:00:00,3,"What a pair of idiots. I think this film is a metaphor for how thick people are today. They have no forward planning, take everything for granted and waste what time & resources they have on frivolous activities. The should of been hunting, preserving and prepping for survival from the beginning. Never going anywhere alone or with out a weapon. Killing, foraging & gathering what they can, pigs in abundance! Come on! Repairing & securing their home, but no let's waste our time dancing & arguing. If this film is a representation of woke modern women, then what will society become. I'm a woman, & I'm embarrassed."
" Horrible ending
",-0.5423,-0.903,2021-03-18 00:00:00,5,I'm so tired of these stories that end horribly. It's almost as if they realize they don't have much time left and they quickly end it.... In the most ridiculous way possible! I can't stand to watch the entire movie only to have a totally bizarre not well thought out ending like this one!
" Finishes When It Should Begin
",0.0,0.402,2021-03-17 00:00:00,5,"Everyone did very well in making this film and it's a good subject. But, the emotional swings of the girls and silly actions can get a bit annoying. Plus contemporary dancing just ain't my thing. Unfortunately the ending is where I wanted it to begin."
" At Least Dumb and Dumber Was Funny, This Was Just Awful
",-0.7096,-0.8541,2021-03-13 00:00:00,1,"Where do I start? Insipid? Hideous? Laughable? What was the point? Was this a survival flick, or a chicken (sisters) flick? I have no idea, and neither do the writers. Elliot Page had one good movie. Juno. Everything else is trash. She is terrible. Evan Rachel has mad skills, why would she take this role? Absolute clownshow."

" How to not survive
",0.0,-0.8574,2021-02-21 00:00:00,1,"Lets pretend that there is a nationwide power outage.
And you and your 2 teen daughters are living in an rather comfortable villa in the forest.
Now what would be your first instinct? Maybe food, fuel and learning basic survival? Or how to get music for one of the daughters dancing lessons!
I at last tried to watch this movie 3 times....and failed. Only thanks to fast forward could I finish it.
It is so stupid. We've seen what a small catastrophe does to people....and than this movie. Maybe there is a hidden message from the director..if so it was too hidden for me.
What's left from this movie? The have endless food, there is no change in the weather (remember this villa has one big glas front....something you can only do with enough power to heat the house otherwise you are freezing to death.
No power but still enough water for bathing.
And of course after 1 1/2 year the villa just crumbles to dust...so it is very intelligent to use your last fuel to burn the house with every food and tools and than seek shelter in an tree trunk during heavy rain.This is a total waste of time!!!"

" The most stupid survival movie I've ever seen
",-0.5709,0.6302,2021-01-08 00:00:00,1,"I just finished this movie and thought it was downright stupid. I was right, because the top reviews in this review said the same thing.This touching drama is right for you if you wanna see:A man die just because a wound on his legs.A young lady acting like a kid just because her younger sister won't let her use the gas. For what? Some useless entertainment.The same young lady keeps practicing dance for no reason. Yeah you gotta waste your energy on something in the apocapyse right?The 2 sisters argue because one of them ate chocolate without telling the other (lol?)They seem to have unlimited supply of food and clean clean water.They also have unlimited gas supply, that's why they decided to burn their Huge house and lived in a damp tree trunk. Best decision ever.Oh and if you wanna see One Hour of Nell's decision to go with her boyfriend, only to decide to walk back home a day later. Yeah that's one hour of the movie.For some reason the house is so safe, because the only threat is that one shopkeeper.For 20+ years of my life, I've never seen such a boring, bland, and stupid movie like this one."
" Utterly nonsensical
",0.0,0.9553,2021-01-05 00:00:00,4,"This could have been so good if the characters had any common sense!
When they realised after a couple weeks the power wouldn't return (and why did it go off permanently anyway) you would then start shooting wild boar not wait for 15 months and a pregnancy for that thought to occur !
Also what did they survive on up until that point...just a few berries and grains of rice !
As for freaky Stan the rapist how did he get there with no supplies and just a polo shirt when we knew that it was at least a few days walk from the town to the house in the woods !
The ending was pathetic, as was the house construction...how many luxury relative new builds start to leak everywhere and collapse after less than two years !
Surely you would annexe the best section of the house for shelter not burn the entire thing down to go live in a tree !
I was constantly expecting common sense and a good storyline to prevail but then it abruptly ended which to be honest was a blessing !
The writers/director clearly expect the viewers to have little if any intelligence to accept all these bizarre decisions!"
" Don't waste your time
",0.3252,0.8731,2021-01-04 00:00:00,1,"It's an interesting concept of the Apocalyptic genre,
but it doesn't deliver at all after it's interesting start.
You'll wait & wait & wait for some story to develop, but it doesn't.
So do yourself a favor, and don't waste your time!"
" Plot Failure
",-0.5106,-0.128,2020-12-25 00:00:00,2,"The writers tried to make a point about surviving without civilized society, clumsily patched in a haphazard plot around it, and never actually made their point. Instead there's the typically vague ending of a movie which has nowhere to go, because it would either become ridiculous in trying to actually demonstrate their point or more realistically demonstrate its complete failure.Good acting of poor content, and nice but repetitive scenery. I agree with the negative reviews containing spoilers, for the same blindingly obvious reasons explained in detail in those. Save yourself a couple hours and read those instead of watching the movie."
" Every mistake in the book
",-0.34,-0.0772,2020-12-12 00:00:00,2,"Will acted but terribly written.Clearly whoever is responsible for this has zero clues about what it takes to actually survive a s**t hitting the fan scenario like this.
It seems as though they've watched a couple film adaptations of Catherine Cookson novels and thought they'd run with a half baked drama which makes no rational or logical sense.Every mistake was made by both the writers and the characters. The movie's attempts at being emotional fell well short because I was just too annoyed. And why is this a Sci-fi? I don't consider it so by a long shot.The movie could have been better if it had been thought out in a more realistic way than this.101 minutes wasted. Oh well."
" Really??? I just wasted part of my life on this...
",-0.6147,-0.4596,2020-11-04 00:00:00,1,"Wow... my first review. The good, the forest is beautiful. The bad, everything else... most reviews are spot on... these girls would last 3 months tops... im still wondering why they slept with the dead body all night... also did he not know how to make a tourniquet?? The house falls completely apart in a year and a half? The house next door to me has been abandoned for 20 years and is not collapsed... the acting was ok, the writing was horrible. It could have been much better. The ending was dumb. Save time, don't bother watching it."
" Strong Performances, Weaker Story
",0.1027,0.089,2020-10-08 00:00:00,5,"The characters' individual and relational developments are the main ideas of the film. The actresses give their all, moreover. Story-wise, there truly isn't much to admire. The plot, setting, all the writing in fact, seems meant only to give a context for the actors to do their thing with their assigned characters."
" ""Sisters of the Wood""
",0.0,-0.5195,2020-10-03 00:00:00,8,"Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.Trigger Warning: sexual violence.Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood carry most of this ""mysterious dystopia"" movie. I'm sure this story can be used as a parallel of what it is to be a woman in the modern world, but I see it as a survival story. The two aren't necessarily exclusive to another.The ""last person on the planet"" trope is good, but even just the idea of living off-grid is daunting enough to the average person without it being the only option.It's a sister story right alongside ""Frozen"" and ""Kill La Kill"" to me. The family togetherness is a good lesson woven into the story.While I'd prefer zombies, they do a great job of showing the story, the character's emotions and how they're feeling about things at any time.On the frustrating side of it: you get to see people make a lot of mistakes in surviving, which of course progresses the story bit by bit."
" dont watch
",0.0,-0.0849,2020-09-20 00:00:00,3,The movie gives you heaps of ideas as to whats happening and never explains what actually is in the end and in some movies this works but for this it didnt go into depth for any of the ideas and left me feeling like i had an itch that wouldnt go away- a good idea but not portrayed well
" Absolute Waste of Time
",-0.4215,-0.974,2020-09-18 00:00:00,1,"I could sit here and write a whole dissertation of why this movie doesn't even deserve to be watched let alone allowed on any streaming service, but no, that would be giving this movie too much of my attention because it surely has already wasted much of my time.
The decisions they make in the movie and the way they handle the situation is an absolute disaster of a plot. Let alone Half of the dialogue is then screaming each other's name. I have so much more negative stuff to say about this movie but I'm done wasting time on writing this. Don't watch it."
" True to the book = poor movie
",-0.0772,0.9407,2020-09-17 00:00:00,2,"You can't judge this movie without familiarity with its source material.I'm a fan of post-apocalyptic stories, and they don't all have to be Mad Max-esque. So, when I found out about this movie, I decided to read the book first. The movie is very true to the book, in that NOTHING HAPPENS. After finishing the book, I was concerned the movie would not be engaging - and it wasn't. The FF button got used more than once. The movie abbreviated what I thought were some of the more interesting parts of the story, which wasn't a ton to begin with.Performances were fine, but the characters are superficial, so there's only so much that can be done. The cinematography is beautiful, but edited so-so. No aspect, from editing, visuals, or sound could save this movie from being a non-story. TBH, I'm shocked anyone signed on to this project at all.A generous 2/10 since, even if it were to it's detriment, the movie is faithful to the book."
" One of the best!
",0.6696,0.9761,2020-08-31 00:00:00,10,"A lot of times when you find slow moving pictures boring, the criticisms are something like, ""you didn't get it. Go watch Transformers"", or something like that. But usually those slow moving pictures are just that, boring. This one isn't.The narrative of this film is the love between two sisters. That's it. Simple. Doesn't look like it could've cost more than a couple million to make. But it's performed by two of the most talented young actors in the business, Ellen Page and Evan Racheal Wood, who both seem to specialize in creating audience empathy. Particularly, Page. With her petite frame and little girl face, you just don't want nothing bad to happen to her. There's a scene where she wakes up from a bad dream, and you just want to jump in the screen, hold her, stroke her hair, and tell her ""it's alright."" Like a daughter. It's this quality, that I believe is a major key to her success in films like Juno and An American Crime. Wood, seems to have this uncanny ability to get into the heads of the characters she plays. She doesn't seem like she could ever act in front of a blue screen, or that any role could be just a ""job"". She becomes the character, as she did in her breakthrough film, 13. Acting seems to be almost an obsession for her. In this film, her character experiences something fairly horrific, and from what i understand, Wood experienced the same thing in her personal life, which obviously added to the realism of the scene.The movie opens up with them being two regular sisters with a father. Nothing special. Sometimes they get along, sometimes not. Just like normal siblings. But at the end of the day, they still love each other. But their characters arc is something to behold. Moving and real! A must see!"
" Disturbing, tragic, and powerful!
",-0.5848,0.8856,2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,A whirlwind of emotions throughout during a long power outage. Evan Rachel Wood and Ellen Page are magnificent throughout! I can't imagine being out of power for over a hundred days. Into the Forest was beautifully filmed with great touches of madness!
" Good Premise but Poor Execution
",-0.4939,0.5499,2020-08-22 00:00:00,4,"I decided to give this movie a shot because I liked the cast and the whole end of the world survival premise was intriguing, but it's very... Boring? You spend two hours just for almost nothing to happen. There are some powerful and emotional moments, but the impact of these moments is overshadowed by slow pacing and really just general uneventfulness."
" A Feminist Fantasy
",0.0,0.978,2020-08-08 00:00:00,6,"The old society model has failed. Why? Perhaps by the end of this review it will be revealed.What's important to know from the outset is that writer/director Patricia Rozema is a feminist lesbian. So is Ellen Page. The novel, written by Jean Hegland was originally published by a non profit feminist press, Calyx in 1996. Her next novel was also about two young mothers and 'their capacity to love.' Detecting a thread here?That essentially answers the questions that many viewers have been confused and frustrated at, especially the ending. In terms of film making, it does seem ludicrous to have the house burnt down, or the fact that it deteriorated so quickly. There were revealing shots of the growth on the roof throughout the entire film, so having it full of mold was not a surprise though still unrealistic. Burning it when it was full of resources was silly, but that's missing the point.The essence is, at the end, two women set out into the forest, the new world, to begin society anew. They have a baby, a male, whom they can start over with. It does suggest possible incest but I'm assuming that they might come across other women also starting the New World Order somewhere out there. (Actually, the massage scene with a topless Page suggests a possible incestuous future relationship, or perhaps there had already been one. They do sleep together and often act as though they are in a relationship. Reading the novel might reveal more on that or Rozema wrote that in herself).The house being destroyed on purpose is a tearing down of the old society and the old family model. That's the essence of the story. It's about women and their feelings and that they don't need men in order to create a better world. All they need is the sperm, and they got that. The three males in this story were all summarily disposed with after their usefulness was reached. Not deliberately but in terms of what the women (they were supposed to be teenagers), needed in order to start over. That's the film in a nutshell. Not all feminists hate men but plenty do and believe that men are not necessary and with the right type of upbringing (dismantling the old 'patriarchy' model which is clearly responsible for having men be the way they are today), can be altered. That's why the baby is a boy. It's saying that it's the system's fault and in the hands of women, society will be better off. Any research will quickly tell you that many people feel this way, and have done for a long time.As for the film, there is some beautiful photography (male cinematographer) and the two leads are excellent. The rape scene is over the top, but that's part of showing us what men are capable of and why women are better off without them. (Only a tiny percentage of men are physically capable of performing in a violent situation like that but feminists wrongly assume otherwise). Callum Keith Rennie is great too. A shame he wasn't in it longer but he had served his purpose. The other two males turn in average performances. (Mingella is especially dull. Perhaps that was the point.)There is a lot to enjoy in the film but logic does get dispatched with too often for a movie. It's metaphoric which is why it probably reads better in the novel.Back to the first line of this review. Why? It's never stated but no doubt men caused the societal collapse in the first place. After all, the world is a bad place and the patriarchy rules the world, right?"
" Not Worth Your Time
",-0.1695,-0.9656,2020-07-03 00:00:00,2,"So I spent 2 hrs of my life yelling at these stupid people. So many mistakes. Everything all 3 of them did was so dumb.
Some examples:
Single father doesn't really know how to protect his daughters.
Living in a remote place with weird people in town and no security.
Taking unnecessary risks with janky chainsaw and huge tree.
Not having gun ready all the time- you knew that guy in town was trouble!
The worst is the end whereby they get the bright idea of Burning Their Only Shelter down with all their tools, pictures, blankets, etc because of Black Mold.
This movie must have been made when Black Mold became the enemy of the people. Everywhere you read about it. People purchasing homes were petrified of it."
" Don't believe the genre listing...
",0.0,-0.5543,2020-06-30 00:00:00,5,"It's a drama, period. When I write this, it's listed as drama thriller. Seeing it somewhere else and from other reviews, it used to also be listed as sci-fi. It's not. It's drama. No sci-fi, no thriller. As a drama, it's okay, though not the best either. But as I expected sci-fi and thriller as well, I was totally disappointed. And what's with the title anyway? I don't think I have seen anything where the title is the absolute end result of the story instead of the story itself. Yeah, the title represents the final 2 minutes of the film. People may have different opinions about this, but I believe it's misleading."
" Truly an amazing movie
",0.7717,0.9396,2020-06-29 00:00:00,10,I so loved this movie I plan to watch is at least more. Incredibly well written with an excellent cast. Ellen page and Evan Rachael woods play well as sisters. This movie is up there with Maudie in my books

" Great acting really sells this movie
",0.6249,0.6757,2020-06-17 00:00:00,8,"The two lead actresses do some of the best acting that I've ever had the privilege to witness.
The movie is a long slow burn which is generally not my thing, but the two lead actresses drew me in and made me want to find out what happens to them.I think that the ending is ridiculous, but I'm still glad that I spent some time with the two main characters."
" This movie is awful
",-0.4588,-0.3173,2020-06-13 00:00:00,1,So boring. So bad. No plot. How do they not know or even care what is happening to the world throughout the whole movie. Please do not waste your time.
" Predictable
",0.0,-0.6908,2020-06-06 00:00:00,3,If you've read the movie description you can guess most of what's in store. Note that there is a rape scene (again: predictable).

",0.4404,-0.7088,2020-05-12 00:00:00,1,"I hate when I get suckered into seeing a movie because the trailer is full of action and suspense, yet the film drags and all the suspense and actions was all used in the 2min trailer out 80mins worth of film. Both actress gave great performances and also beautiful cinematography throughout the movie, but not enough to get me to watch it all. I only got through 58mins of the movie and had to shut it off, I was board to death!"
" Very exciting and didactic
",0.5413,0.9286,2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"I liked it a lot, because it was exciting and somehow I felt the story very close to myself. These days we never know what can become a true story, so I felt didactic even. The girls were very clever and up to the challenge what was in front of them. The only thing I would be curious about is that, actually what happened out there what caused this whole situation."
" Ok movie
",0.296,-0.2175,2020-05-04 00:00:00,6,"Not good, not bad, just ok. Not enough on how to survive. Too many unanswered questions. Houses don't deteriorate as fast as they portrayed it. If you live as remote as they did, you would be better prepared."
" End of the world film is ordinary and scary as it likely really would be.
",-0.4939,0.9075,2020-04-27 00:00:00,7,"This realistic end-of-the-world story unfolds as it likely really would. Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood play sisters living with their widowed father in the forest when an unexplained power outage occurs that leads to a breakdown in civil order. There are rumors as to what happened or how widespread it is, but it's never fully explained and that is not the focus of the film. The story instead focuses on Page and Woods' characters and how they face the many challenges of living in this new world, which includes grocery store clerks now carrying shotguns, rationing gasoline, and an increasing wariness of people who used to be friends and neighbors (or even relatives). I don't want to spoil any plot points, but what unfolds is what would likely really happen. You'd have to contend with a world without lights, internet, or music. You'd no longer know what's happening outside your village. You'd have to get used to the idea that the world is forever changed and is not going back to how things were before. In many ways, this film felt like the 1983 film ""The Testament,"" which depicted a typical family after a nuclear warhead fell on the United States. Completely unsensational but the ordinariness of the characters and situations make the film far more identifiable of an experience when compared to ""Mad Max"" or ""A Boy and His Dog,"" and consequently more impactful. However, on the downside, the ordinariness of the film also leads to some slow pacing and not always compelling of situations. Still, within the context of this film, it does work and is what makes this end-of-the-world story unique and all the more engaging. FUN FACT! The pig butchering scene was real. Ellen Page learned the process specifically to include in this film."
" A rehabilitating review
",0.0,-0.982,2020-04-10 00:00:00,8,"Given the diametric reviews of this title I decided to write my own as a way of perhaps rehabilitating it somewhat. The ending is hard to understand but only if we fail to follow the film's theme to its logical conclusion. I for one would have strengthened the best section of the house to make it habitable for the long run. There was plenty of good materials after all but I'm looking at it with the eye of a carpenter who's surrounded by the trappings of civilization.The sisters were more than capable of undertaking repairs. They had what appeared to be books on the subject judging from the other dilemmas they solved, food for one. They had become largely dependent on the forest for nutrition, including the curing and preservation of its feral inhabitants. They were handy with an axe and split firewood with expertise, something that only the inexperienced would presume simplistic. It's not hard to believe they would have been able to tackle this problem with the same ingenuity they had shown so far.I believe their decision to burn down the house was symbolic. It was an act of definitive disengagement from society and civilization. This was the theme of the film, the ending made that clear. The house's rapid decline is a bit of a problem but the timeline is immaterial. The film is about the decline of civilization, the final separation from its trappings. The symbolism behind their disappearance into the darkness of the forest is hard to mistake. I can only imagine what I would find if I met them in the distant future or what would become of their descendants.Once I got over the shock of their final action, once I understood their act of defiance and rebellion it all made sense. The sisters were abandoning a society they had been struggling to maintain, one with her ceaseless preparation for exams, the other with endless dance rehearsals. The brutality of the rape was the initial justification followed by the house's gradual collapse, the decision to carry the pregnancy to term and give birth under the protection of the forest in the follow of the tree that would become their home."

" A stunning film on the Apocalypse (without zombies).
",0.3818,-0.8674,2020-03-28 00:00:00,10,"Shunning all green screen superhero action movie razzle dazzle, Rozema gives us the real goods -- what it would be like for the grid to go down and then never come back. Day after day they wait for the lights to come on. Until they don't anymore. The two protagonists (and us) never do find out what caused this apocalypse, even as it slowly but surely encroaches on their isolated world. Akin to Soderberg's Contagion, the suspense is in the relentless, unadorned unfolding of each ordinary moment of the disaster. This is a seriously underrated film."
" Underutilized potential

",-0.4767,-0.9209,2020-02-06 00:00:00,3,"I really love Ellen, and the overall acting was somewhat decent, and so was the forest setting. That stuff they get right, but where this movie fails, is a total lack of logic on the part of the characters. The movie becomes quite boring, as the characters go from one bad decision to another. The father dies from a chainsaw accident, and the girls barely seem to care. They just dig a hole, roll him into it and go on.....They stay in a house with no power, but somehow find just enough food that they look super healthy and fine, but whine about no music?? Instead of fixing the multiple leaks in the house, or EVEN BETTER moving into one of dozens of other abandoned NORMAL houses that are in far better shape, they stay till the house is literally falling apart...supposedly, ...the movie lacks logic. It is the ""how NOT to survive an apocalypse "" movie. It has a few decent scenes, but fails on lack of logic....Sad, what a waste of acting talent."

Great acting from all, just very poor writing and unrealistic actions and reactions.
Ava just cannot live without music! Never mind thinking about anyone else or actually needing the gasoline for staying alive, she's ridiculously angry that it can't be used to power the generator for some music.
Ava's character first criticizing Nell on how stupid she'd be getting pregnant with the boyfriend, but then the story has her adamantly refusing to abort the child from her violent rape! What the heck??
Also, now they have a newborn but they're not going to separate off the dance area of the house from the actually mold-infested section, they're going to completely BURN down the house! Where will they live and how? Totally stupid plot direction."

This movie is beyond unbelievable but it tries to be this heart felt potentially realistic story about two girls surviving against all odds. One likes to dance and is too old for whatever competition she was trying to do (I'm guessing X-Factor). The other one I guess is supposed to be 17 or 18? but she acts like she's a 30yo playing as a 17yo maybe that's because she is. There's not much else to say about this movie. Two spoiled chicks and their exotic house in the woods try to tough it out and bad things happen to them.Golly gee it's the middle of an epidemic and people are desperate for their survival. Let me not set up a defense parameter and run around carefree like no strange people will ever appear at my house.My main question is why does the house have so many leaks in the roof or leaks at all. What does that have to do with the power being out? This is like one of those millionaire log cabins but somehow it turns into 3rd world living quarters after like a week of no electricity.

The point of the movie seems to be this. In a world without technology, women are at the mercy of men who are physically stronger. After rape, theft, and abuse, the women flee into the forest where there are no men. Their chance of survival appears to be slim given their lack of resources or the knowledge and ability to create tools needed for survival. In the end, the sisters are rid of the threat of men, but fleeing into the wild with no tribal support, will most likely not survive."

I loved the simplicity of it, of two siblings who are on polar ends realizing the necessity of coming together and figuring out how they're going to deal with this situation together. ultimately at the end of everything they make the decision that's staying together as sisters is what they need and will help them survive.

",0.4404,-0.8721,2019-10-01 00:00:00,9,"If you didn't care for this, that's good. Because it probably wasn't made with you in mind.But me, I loved it. I've seen reviewers state that this gives women a bad image, and that it gives men an even worse image. I find all of that funny, because I found it to be quite realistic in terms of what two young women would do and experience in the case of a technological meltdown. Honestly, in reality I'm sure things would've been a lot more horrific. These two actresses really showed their talents in this. The emotions surrounding the rape and father's death were so raw and real, it's hard not to be captivated by the intensity.I've read reviews saying that these two young women are weak because they couldn't think practically or logically without dad. I think it was the opposite. These two prevailed and conquered after losing the father. These two barely 20-somethings living in an ultra modern world managed to not only take care of themselves but ration their gasoline, grow and forage for their own food, and take care of one another without killing each other. (Unlike what I could say for some men) The character of Eva even has a child with not so much as an aspirin to soothe the pain. Ask any mother or woman, that scene was hard. Many of these scenes were. But that's life.I've seen many reviewers criticize the decision to burn the house down at the end of the film. After watching this a few times, I notice that they lay things out for us quite neatly. That house was already falling apart at the seams before pops died. The roof was caving in a week after the power went. There would've been mold inside pretty much from the get-go.For a new mom to walk in and see the watered-logged, moldy, mess of a home and say, I can't stay here, is not irrational nor is it post-partum depression. It's her intuition, senses, and knowledge working at full speed. An environment like that would give that baby respiratory problems, if not kill it, relatively swiftly. When it comes to deterring further unwanted guests (looters, squatters, attackers) burning the house down may have been the best idea. Especially when you think about how (even with the rain) it may have created a signal fire, leading to their rescue.The actors in this film did such a phenomenal job. The directing, writing, and cinematography were top notch from the usual BS I see in the theatres. If the people with such negative responses had taken the time to open their minds to what art can be and not have felt personally attacked by a film about women persevering and building by themselves, this may have made it much further. We're just not there yet. But we are close.Be smart, be present, rebuild. Survive."

The plot is focused on just two sisters and how they EMOTIONALLY survive ""the end of the world"" while relying on each other.

" Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood shine in this apocalyptic thriller
",-0.705,0.8006,2019-08-07 00:00:00,7,"While many reviews under this movie are negative, I actually enjoyed this viewing experience.
The two lead actresses, Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood, portray two sisters trying to survive and adapt in an apocalyptic rural America. Both of these actresses provide touching and dedicated performances. After Eva's rape, Wood gives a very raw performance as she tries to cope with the trauma. Both Page and Wood also have good chemistry with each other. They give a believable sisterly bond.
I must admit that this movie was a slow burn and had some pacing issues. Personally, I enjoy a slow burn. However, some of the events in this movie have an odd range from being slow paced to fast paced.
Some of the writing in this movie is also odd. I understand that this movie is based off of a book, so the movie must have tried the best it could to give justice to the book. However, in an apocalyptic world, I did not expect the lead's father to die from an accidental chainsaw wound to the leg. I found that anticlimactic considering this is such a huge turning point for the sisters.
Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I found myself wanting the best for the two sisters. I admit that this movie had flaws and it wasn't the best movie to come from A24, but this is not a bad movie."

" Into the Sisterhood!
",0.0,0.9302,2019-07-12 00:00:00,6,"Into the Forest is another of the fairly plentiful supply of films that feature intriguing set-ups to what you hope will be suspenseful dramatic scenarios, only to wander off into into bland melodramatic outcomes, that are as emotionally unsatisfying, as they are unrealistic.Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood both give terrific performances in writer/director Patricia Rozema's apocalyptic, come survival feature, though I do qualify these comments in respectfully suggesting neither looks like the fresh faced, pretty much virginal young teenager they are supposed to be. Yes, Ellen Page in 2007, really looked the part as Juno. But 8 years later, playing a similarly aged character, I don't think so. Same with Wood even though she's playing a slightly older 18 - 19 year old.They play two yin and yang opposite sisters who are forced to bond and fight for survival after an unknown occurrence causes a total loss of widespread power across North America.The differences are made tellingly explicit in the first act. Wood's Eva, is tall, blond and willowy, with single-minded ambitions to be a professional ballerina. Page's Nell is short, dark and just wants to get good results in her final high school year exams, whilst still enjoying her peers' social scene. They live what looks like a self-sustaining existence with their widowed father, in an isolated, but finely constructed and well stocked house with all mod cons, in a northern Californian forest area.The film looks great, set primarily as it is, against a splendid forest backdrop with the natural majesty of British Columbia subbing more than capably for the redwoods of California. But dramatically things begin to take a turn for the worse, when the storyline appears to take great pains to avoid discussing any specific causes for the blackout. The family travels to town to resupply, a couple of weeks after the disaster. But then we are asked to accept that they essentially don't appear the slightest bit interested in seeking out news of the cataclysmic event that has caused shops to be emptied of their stock, future deliveries of fuel made unsure and widespread complete media blackouts. Dad continues to be phlegmatic about things in general, despite a complete lack of any type of emergency personnel. Nell wants to party with her friends and Eva wants to do well with her ballet auditions. Driving home into a mysterious road block involving enigmatically silent gunmen at the side of the road, piques our interest, but then is never directly narratively followed up.The challenges become predictably more difficult for the siblings after their father dies in a fluke accident and they have to argue and negotiate over how to ration food, protect themselves from invaders, and hold onto their sanity. Unfortunately this all occurs in an increasingly, undramatic fashion with the decisions being made and the resulting aftermaths appearing less and less realistic, let alone sensible.With the benefit of hindsight it is sometimes too easy to be critical. But I believe it is indicative of the narrative deficiencies of this feature that the title ""Into the Forest"" only really references the final few scenes of the movie and is disappointingly, most definitely not evocative of the whole story."

A pair of narcissists that lived in a forest, all their lives, and have learned nothing about survival or that beautiful forest.
The number and frequency of contrivances in this movie destroy any feeling of immersion.
The violence is for emotional shock value and to make you feel sorry for the two sisters. #allMen, who aren't your father, boyfriend or a diversity hire, are beasts, unable to control their base urges once the lights go out. One sister is so smart she could ""run the Universe"" and the other is a fit modern dancer, doing it hard to get to the top, but they somehow end up doing dumb stuff, being weak minded and vulnerable. As I said, contrived to get the feelings and emotions the writer and director are desperately trying to pull from the audience. It's supposed to be an emotional journey ending in an awakening and blossoming of strong femininity but that's not how you'll feel after watching this film.
Two cookie cutter performances going through the motions, happy, sad, angry, scared, crying and concerned looks.

My only criticism of the movie was the overly-realistic rape scene. It is the one scene from the movie that will stick with me...and not for the right reasons. It is a violent and brutal scene that has no consistency with the other parts of the movie. Yes, Ellen Page really butchered a pig but no other scene comes close to it.

The first page of reviews can be summed up as ""they are bad at survival movies."" but I think perhaps people are too used to watching disaster movies and not very good at understanding what they might do themselves. Not to suggest the living situation they're in is typical, but this movie is a far more realistic approach IMO than what we usually see: where day 1 people are murdering each other for any advantage as if they knew the world wouldn't be fixed the next day. I was wondering if the power would come back on in the end, so if a viewer was thinking that then I think the characters might be hoping for the same.The acting was superb. There is no faulting it there from anybody.For the people hating on the house falling apart, it shows us in the first couple minutes that it is decrepit. Tarps on the roof. People see a clean inside and nice tech and assume that the house is built to last, but that roof was obviously pointed out as faulty in the first couple minutes. This, with nearly every other fault I just read I could easily point out scenes that addressed said issues. It's just not that bad at all.The ending is rushed into sillyness, burning the house, while maybe understandable in some sense, was definitely handled ridiculously. Salvaging everything would be the best bet(trips back and forth) and they could have spent more time with that but it wouldn't have had the dramatic ending they were going for. Being unreachable in the woods is definitely ideal. I'm curious if the book fleshed this out more or had the same crazy decision agreed upon.Not much happens, for this type of movie, but perhaps this isn't ""that"" type of movie as much as it seems on the surface. It's about sisters bonding and figuring things out, not dodging Walking Dead style gangs of henchmen.Overall I think it's pretty good."

This flaw of the plot has been pointed out by a lot of reviewers, so here's my addition:
Eva argues for burning down the house by saying people had already been around for some 200,000 years before the last 140 when they could also enjoy electricity.
True. Yet, misleading.
Modern age brought us electricity and other useful stuff like washing machine, insulated windows, dentists, contraceptives, etc. All these things let individualism thrive. And here they are, isolated from other people, with a degrading but still considerable pool of modern products. It was their modern house and the modern resources within that allowed them to survive this far. If they dispose of these, they need to return to the traditional alternative: become part of a tight COMMUNITY! Two is nothing in the face of a harsh winter. Try a hundred.

",0.5423,0.8707,2019-01-30 00:00:00,8,"There's been a lot of indie movies where the power goes out. There's generally a pattern, either beset by problems without or problems within. Here there is a bit of both, and ultimately the film is an ode to survival. It's a very natural film, with a general photographic expertise in regard to the forest. At no point to you feel human behaviour is being exaggerated, that there is a drama being generated for the sake of the audience and to let actors do what they are best at. I won't sugarcoat the pace of this movie, it's slow. Luckily the two leads are up to the challenge given all the restraints and expectations I just mentioned, and, for me at least, it was a very uplifting and hopeful experience. When I rack my brain for those indie movies where the power went out I can't remember the titles, only what generally happened. If this is any help, Into The Forest is a title you'll remember."

Older sister preaches to younger sister about not getting pregnant, making a whole unnecessary story arc about the younger sister having a boyfriend seem relevant. The older sister gets raped, and decides suddenly that having a baby is totally fine in a survival situation. This forces the younger sister to hunt and gather so the older sisters baby can be born healthy.Then the house gets moldy, and the older isters bright idea after birthing a baby is ""let's burn it down, start fresh."" Starting fresh consists of them living in a hollowed our tree. Much like typical pro life propaganda there's NO attention paid to how they'll now care for this baby especially considering they've literally burned down their shelter instead of repair it.The power outage is just the thin veneer of why these girls are living off the land. You never find out why the power isn't out, or how the rest of the world is coping, aside from that one guy that wanders by for a quick rape visit for no apparent reason other than to introduce the pregnancy plot twist. Terrible movie, poor writing, don't waste your time on this one unless you'd like to watch a boring movie about two girls camping, arguing about who ate the last piece of chocolate, pushing out a baby and burning their house down to camp in a tree stump with no plans for the foreseeable future."

No one thought of climbing up on the roof to at least clear all the crap off? How about cleaning the gutters? What happens when gutters are clogged? The water goes under the roof and (wait for it!) it rots the wood and then it caves in! You would think with all their survival books and smarts they would figure out how to cover up the leaks. Yikes!Okay, the roof caved in and it's raining. What, you're going into labor? I've got it! We'll have the baby.....in a tree!!!

I mean they never explain what causes the blackout so why did the locals IMMEDIATELY go into long term survival mode?Their dad hurts himself with a chainsaw - it's an ugly wound, but not immediately life threatening, but he dies in seconds!

FIRST ATTEMPT! Other than this and some berry and herb collecting, they seem to survive for over a year on the food in the house.The house looks amazing, but the roof starts leaking (they make no attempt to fix the leak), and then part of the roof caves in - hmm. They then decide that the house is unsalvageable and USING THEIR PRECIOUS FUEL, burn it down??!!? And go off to live in the woods having shown no sign of any ability to do anything practical like REPAIR THE FRIGGIN ROOF. How exactly do they expect to survive now?

The story is told in just the right rhythm to me, gentle and slow or unnerving and fast. The characters were all very well cast.

I was disappointed that Nell's boyfriend just leaves and doesn't come back with her. Eva was worried about not having food for everyone, but they obviously were able to come up with more food and he could have helped with that.
I'm still getting into the idea of ending a story right in the middle. The viewer is left with a ton of questions. What happened to them in the end? Do they survive? How did the power even go out in the first place? I suppose that is up to the viewer to decide."

We get one here that features a blackout that makes things really quite inconvenient...I thought something would be revealed at the end, something that may have been creepy due to the font they used for the title of this one, but no, another movie where nothing was revealed and there is seemingly no point to the film other than teaching us that if you have no power, your house collapses fairly quickly.The story has a power outage that makes a father and his two daughters feel a bit uneasy at first, but they manage to get into town so the older daughter can dance and the younger one can attend a party and they can get a few supplies. The father does not want to go into town again due to some rather rough looking characters being present, but the younger sister throws a fit making it seem like she is going to be the problem during this apocalypse. Well, the father dies by means of chainsaw leaving the two daughters to fend for themselves and the older daughter wants to use the gas to power up the house almost immediately, because she must dance! Seriously, this is the most mediocre apocalypse ever with the exception of the rape scene. Watching two sisters stumble along during the least threatening apocalypse ever!So the film just has too many flaws as I watch a film like this to see real threats, not a sister want to dance and waste gas, a future house and a super old car, an easily avoidable death by chainsaw, a futuristic house that falls apart fairly quickly. Seriously, dad must have really put off getting a roof on that house for it to totally go kaput that quickly. The only disturbing scene was the rape scene which I could have done without. I would have preferred creepy monsters or something which the font made it seem like this movie would have.So no, not a good movie and yet another unexplained apocalypse. The ending to this one was utter trash as the older sister wants to live in the woods. Great, you didn't want to go hiking with the one guy, but living in a tree stump, that is a good idea. Though that tree stump magically was tougher than their house was! This movie really opened my eyes though, if one wants to dance, one will throw a fit until one gets their way despite the costs of doing so!"

",-0.34,-0.9951,2018-08-05 00:00:00,1,"The movie rather looks like a badly edited mashup from survivor episodes focusing on the boring story of two failing contestants. This introduction should tell enough about the quality of directing and script upfront. The tenuous plot is set up on a power outage that lasts 15+ months. In today's living standards this is as close as you could get to an apocalyptic world but the movie never goes into that avenue. Instead, it uses the power outage as a stage decoration backdrop for the whimsical behaviors of two sisters whose survival instincts and decisions can't match a five year old. The grindingly slow pace and wispy dialog don't help the poor quality of the movie, either. Part of the reason is that there are hardly any subplots that would help to pick up the tempo except for a couple of instances which come out of nowhere and fizzle out quickly. As for the acting, one can speak about some decent efforts from Ellen Page but owing to the dismal script, she, too fails a convincing performance. Finally, the absurdity of the ending is beyond description.The lack of electricity for the collapse of our modern world is a valid reason but the movie makes no attempt to give a rationale for the extended power outage. It's also incomprehensible to see some parts of US with power while other regions are out of it over a year. Finally, our social order and life in big cities are all organized around electrical power. As much implausible as it seems, even a month long outage would take us to a madmax world order since we can't wind back to 1850's at the snap of a finger. In the absence of electrical power, there would be no universities, no hospitals, no dance clubs, no tv stations, no malls but famine, disease, marauding gangs, plundering, killing rampage and anarchy on the streets. Without making a a reference to such a chaotic world, showing the girls continuing their everyday life with the usual concerns of the modern life is naive and pathetic beyond comprehension."

The real story is about the sisters, their love and bond.I'm a man and could understand that was what it wanted to portray. Those who hate it seem to be usual survivalists freaks, you need more guns and ammo. Read a couple of those, one said "" you can't read how to survive from books "", on the contrary you can, what berries, fruits and roots are edible or not. Another said "" didn't understand why they killed that animal "", it was read out to the audience and sister. A certain vitamin deficiency is due to lack of meat and dairy products, they'd been living on rice, beans and berries. If you want Mad Max adventure look elsewhere, you'll hate it.

There was such an amazing connection between the lead actresses, and their dynamic relationship through the movie was incredibly authentic and fascinating. I would agree with some of the negative reviews that some of the choices the sisters made during the movie probably weren't the best, but I think that gives the movie some of its reality. The end, well, this is where it goes a bit wrong for me. The logic explained in the movie is a bit off putting, and I do see it as a waste. I don't want to spoil what happens so that is all I will say about it.

",-0.5106,-0.9558,2018-01-21 00:00:00,2,"I've seen my fair share of dumb apocalypse scenario films, ranging from the far-fetched to the completely implausible, but 'Into the Forest' takes the biscuit. This film is just ludicrous, dreadfully written and featuring characters without a brain cell between them. Anybody with an ounce of common sense would never do what the characters in this film do to survive, in fact they would often do the complete opposite.Why would anybody choose to sleep outside in the rain and freezing cold when they could just sleep inside? Why would anybody in their situation burn their only shelter, and their own home to the ground, and then live inside a tree? And why would anybody desperate to survive waste their valuable time and energy doing bizarre and pointless exercise routines? 'Into the Forest' is one of the dumbest survival films I've ever seen."
" A Tale Of Love And The Will To Survive...
",0.6369,-0.2578,2018-01-10 00:00:00,9,"I might be sticking my neck out and going against the stream; but this grabbed me, held me, and passed before I was ready.
I'd checked out the IMDB reviews before watching this on BBC iPlayer, and almost didn't watch. I'm glad I took the gamble, this was and IS a fantastic story on so many levels. I'm watching it again as soon as I've written this.The performances are true, I totally sympathised with the characters. There's an easy, laconic unraveling of the story. We're definitely made to think. A lot of the clues about the disintegration of society are subtle, every day events. I found it rather pleasing that the Writers/Director (Jean Hegland, Patricia Rozema) give us the credit of being able to think for ourselves without making things too obvious. The house itself becomes a metaphor for society, so we can track it's metamorphosis, degradation and death knowing this is happening to everyone, everywhere.TRYING TO GIVE A BROAD PICTURE WITHOUT SPOILERS (cover your eyes);Nell (Ellen Page) is little sister, cosseted and nurtured by Dad (Kallum Keith Rennie) and much bigger sister Eva (Evan Rachel Wood). She is destined to live a comfortable life, apart from the gap year travelling the world or in The Peace Corp (I made that last bit up, she doesn't, but you get the picture). They live in a gorgeous, all mod cons and tech house in the forest three days walk from town. Not a problem with a 4x4 and plenty of petrol, a big deal without them.
A minor setback becomes an all encompassing disaster; a small power cut drags out becoming a national (and possibly global) emergency, slowly eroding a rural society and its access to all of the modern comforts that were taken for granted like full petrol pumps, the internet and bulging supermarket shelves.
There's an unfortunate accident that leaves both sisters in limbo not really knowing what to do or how to get by. Starvation is a real threat, the girls are totally isolated and just floundering. However Nell starts to rise to the challenge forced by hunger to dig deep and tap into that survival instinct. The one inherited from our ancestors; thousands of generations of hunter gatherer survivors. Slowly the girls learn how to use the forest and realise they're surrounded by an abundance of food and everything they could need, Starvation needn't be an option anymore. The self sufficiency continues, the girls actually start to thrive, although totally isolated, they are almost content. But, as always, it's not to last, dastardly 'modern man' almost destroys the idyll. Although his interference is brief he inadvertently begins the new chapter for humanity, setting in motion events that allow the girls to cut their ties with the past and all of its modern ills, and embrace the new world with a sense of purpose...This is a film for thinkers, not a jack hammering compilation of steam punk violence or fake morality where 'the good guys' always win and the bad guys always die in regret. If you need to be told what to think and want instant gratification, then you might not enjoy Into The Forrest at all. If you have an inquiring mind and like independent non Hollywood style films, then I think you'll like this, a lot. I can't be that wrong, can I?"
" they never went into the forest
",0.0,-0.9888,2017-12-31 00:00:00,2,"After ""It Comes At Night"" had absolutely nothing come at night, i'm getting sick of these moody post-apocalyptic dramas with titles that are completely wrong or misleading as to the actual content of the movie.the movie at the start is about a single father with two young adult daughters, Nell and Eva, living in a house out in the woods on the west coast. Then there's a catastrophic power outage that ends up being far worse than a random outage.
While the concept is broad enough not to be based on anything already written, it reminded me very strongly of the novel by William Forstchen ""One Second After"", about a father and his two young girls living in a small town in the Carolinas when a massive EMP event hits and they have to go months without power.The novel, which supposedly Newt Gingritch said inspired him to talk about the threat of EMP attacks on the US power grid, was incredibly written and dealt with a lot of the dangerous issues to be dealt with without any sort of electricity, including one of his daughters being diabetic and them having to constantly scour and barter for insulin and ice, while maintaining some manner of stability in the community.
This movie does absolutely none of that. The father dies due to an inexplicable accident in which he is apparently wasting gasoline using a chainsaw to cut down a tree for firewood, only to have it come apart and saw his leg and he bleeds out. This leaves the two daughters to survive for many months in their house hidden away in the woods without power.
There's never any real danger. They have a seemingly endless supply of clean water, enough not just to drink but to bathe and shave with regularity, and an even more endless supply of rice and beans that not only lasts them many many months, but lasts them throughout having Nell's boyfriend over for several days as well. 
They somehow continue to maintain the house for over a year, doing nothing but chopping firewood and going on with Nell studying and Eva practicing dancing. The only threat from people in town is when a random shopkeep they'd met earlier shows up to rape Eva and leave.
At the end, suddenly the house is seeing huge pieces collapse due to black mold, and with Eva having a baby, she decides not only can she not live in the moldy house anymore but she wants to use the last of their gasoline to set it on fire and leave.I don't know how to handle a mold outbreak in a house, but in a post-apocalyptic setting where there's been no electricity in virtually the entire country for over a year, and no communication with the outside world beyond rumor, I think ditching and burning down a huge house that has gone 15 months without being raided or even discovered by potential bandits and looters is suicide.
Another reviewer put it simply and truly; they would die very quickly in the real world. Even if we could believe that they had a perfect house with a huge supply of food and water that lasted them 15 months, they'd end up dead within days after scuttling it and going out on their own without any food or supplies or shelter and a newborn baby."
" Ludicrously bad - in a boring way
",-0.7184,-0.9208,2017-12-08 00:00:00,1,"This film should have been titled 'Hanging About in a House for Months With No Electricity'. Only in the final couple of minutes does the story start to do what the title promises, when the girls actually go Into the Forest. Following them in there, tracking their story of survival, might have been interesting. As it is, very little happens in the big modern house in the wood. One of the girls dances a lot, but misses her music. The other thinks about going off with her character-free boyfriend, but changes her mind. There is one nasty, very violent rape, dislocated from the rest of the story. The reason for the apocalyptic power cut is never convincingly explained and while the months tick by (we know this via helpful captions) the women are unchanged - even their hair stays the same, with one of them sporting the same razor-sharp cut after eight months that she had at the beginning. The season does not change either - three months, six months, whatever, it is still May. As for the ending, why would they set fire to the place? What possible reason was there to do that? (I wondered if it was an attempt to imitate the ending in Housekeeping, a brilliant and totally different film). Only two good things in this: the beautiful forest, what little we saw of it; and Evan Rachel Wood's beautiful face."

When you see it, you'll understand. Some may even say it is completely unnecessary. It is depressing and I guess it was supposed to even further challenge the viewer.Whatever the case, the movie itself is pretty slow and some also might say boring. It is a slow burner, so there is that for starters. And there is really not that much going on. It does have some merits, especially in the family dynamic, but overall there is something missing. The actors do try their best, but it just isn't enough to put this in a really good place."

The father dies in a chainsaw accident and the girls are forced to deal with the ongoing power outage.I don't want to give Eva an out and dismiss her actions as simple girlie inferiority. There is an issue with a lack of common sense from Eva. I have issues with other characters as well. I don't buy Eli walking to Boston and leaving Nell for a hope for a job. I do buy one thing and one thing only, the chemistry between Page and Wood. These are two solid actresses and they present good work as these characters. They have nice sibling chemistry and the movie flows well from that spring."

So if you are waiting for something to happen, it does, and life goes on without much fanfare. Good performances, realistic, once you get past the electricity never comes back on, however the entertainment value, at least for me is low.Evan Rachel Wood is actually younger than Ellen Page pushing 30...still playing a teen.Guide: F-word, sex, rape, brief nudity (Evan Rachel Wood, Ellen Page)"

Except no attempt to fix leaks on roof then no attempt to rebuild a new shelter or clean and repair the house. When the boyfriend was there could have had him more involved and trying to help.

" great acting, location, and music
",0.6249,0.9145,2017-08-07 00:00:00,6,"What this is not: a sci-fi thriller. If you go into this expecting that, you're going to be extremely disappointed.This movie is a drama, centered around two sisters isolated after all power goes out. The acting, soundtrack, and location are beautiful. To me, this was very realistic. What do you do when no one has electricity, gas, or communication with the rest of the world? Try to seriously put yourself in their place. I'd like to think I'd go about things a little differently than these two characters did, but we'd probably all act similarly: go about waiting for someone to fix it. When no one fixes it and food starts to run out, try whatever you can to get food and be able to survive another day, in hopes that eventually someone will ""fix it.""I would've appreciated more information about the two sisters history. The film doesn't even convey what age they are. Anywhere from 16-22 seems plausible.Would I watch this again? No. But that's just because of certain violent scenes. I would recommend this film, though. Watching it is not a waste of time, as long as you don't start watching this because you think it's a sci-fi thriller!The music is hauntingly beautiful. Reminiscent of the soundtrack to Gattaca. It was my favorite part.An unrelated note: this is my first review, so I apologize if it was disjointed or just terrible."
" Dark and absurd
",0.0,-0.9528,2017-07-31 00:00:00,1,"I have applied the spoiler warning to be fair, but I haven't revealed anything that isn't in the parental warnings.There is a lot of darkness and sorrow in this film. To quote Ava: ""It just feels like these black waves. And I (sob} swim up to the surface and I think (sob) I'll be OK. I can fight this (sob) and then another black wave comes and I'm just drowning again."" There is a rape in this movie and the woman's face is shown through what seems like a long sequence. I am against actually showing rape in movies. In a similar way, I am also against showing explicit torture of anyone. I believe that both of these are too easily exploited.I question the choice to show a topless woman, who only seconds ago could barely move because she wrenched her back, suddenly rise up in bed and nimbly turn so viewers can see her naked breast while she tries to comfort her distraught sister. Taken together, is this art, or exploitation? Since the nudity is not necessary to advance the story, I lean toward exploitation.Beyond these complaints, there are many stupid things in this movie beginning with the blackout that mysteriously lasts forever. But I also refer to stupid choices. For instance, in the sequence leading to the wrenched back, why did this small girl try to lift a rock that a man twice her size could probably not move. There are many more. They are just absurd.I'm sure we all appreciate graphically showing the pig gutting.I did appreciate Ava's desire to respect the baby's rights."
" Performances: Great, Story: Okay, Climax: WTF? [+46%]
",0.1197,0.9734,2017-07-31 00:00:00,5,"While the title and synopsis suggest a survival drama, this movie in fact gives you very little detail on the actual measures taken to 'survive' in a situation of prolonged power outage. Two sisters, Nell and Eva, are left orphaned after their dad succumbs to the injuries he received from a chainsaw accident, leaving them helpless at their house with no electricity.This is a story that tries to highlight the bond between the two sisters played by Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood who deliver terrific and above-average performances respectively. As such, the film packs an emotional punch but fails terribly as a survival thriller. For instance, one wonders how they look as gleeful and healthy as they are, even after a year of no-power (the reason for which isn't explained clearly either). How were they able to procure clean water? Surely, they must have decided on some constraints in the quantity of food they eat. But this doesn't seem to take any toll on their bodies (not even a minor blemish); Page's cheeks look round and rosy as ever. They must have had to hunt for food on more instances than what's shown in the film. They should have had to fend off more intruders than just the one guy who ends up raping the (supposedly) older sister. There are a plethora of possibilities that could have taken place in the lives of the two sisters. But alas, the director doesn't seem interested in expounding any of it.Logical reasoning does take a backseat too often, in between the highly emotional moments. Like Eva almost springing into a comfortable upright position just after she has gone through a painful delivery. Like Eva deciding to go ahead with childbearing after being raped. Like the posh house that starts falling apart in like a year and half of not-so- great maintenance (so much for modern architecture!). Like using their last available bit of fuel to burn their house down during heavy downpour and deciding to take shelter in a tree stump instead (with an infant, mind you!) while they could have at least used the gasoline to warm themselves later on.Nevertheless, the movie does score high on performances and this is probably why one wouldn't want to write off the film altogether. I just wish the movie probed more into the actualities of survival than staging emotional scenes.Verdict: Writing department needed to do a lot better!"

The dancer dances to a metronome. They argue. They eat berries.A boyfriend appears, and they start an astonishing road trip from west to east coast! Whooo---apocalyptic road trip. No wait. It doesn't happen. Girl goes back to her sister, dude continues on.Then they argue. They eat stuff. And she dances to whiny music. And stuff.I have an idea how to make this a true apocalyptic thriller - JUST FORCE PEOPLE TO WATCH IT AND MOST WILL KILL THEMSELVES.I've been playing whiny songs and dancing pretentiously so I can improve my health and recover the 1 1/2 hours I lost watching this garbage."

I thought she was displaying a case of postpartum psychosis and wondering what is her sister gonna do about that... And what does she do? She agrees that the best option, with her sister's baby just having been born, is to burn the house and go live inside a tree bark while it's raining and doesn't look like it's gonna stop? WTF!?The movie was OK, performances OK, premise OK. What happens to our civilization if (when) we lose power and communications? How do we survive, having lost all our survival skills (or never even being learnt)? The film deals with issues such as human nature, people robbing and raping each other in case of a catastrophe, instead of helping out and joining forces.I feel like the most sensitive topics, like how do you preserve food and how do you grow food and how do you prepare food and how do you survive winters when there's no food around and... basically anything that's about survival has been left out. How do they survive 15 months in the forest? There only so much berries in the forests and they're not even there for the entire year... Though, they did show how they can (cook and sterilize) berries, which is respectable.All in all, the entire film was overshadowed by the ending. They didn't cover much of survival - OK, I can get over it, films don't have to be about what I expect them to be about - but the ending is a complete and absolute sack of... well you know what.

It totally and abruptly jars me from any sort of immersion I may have been having, and that is exactly what happened here with ""Into the Forest(2015)"".The premise is quite interesting, and everyone acting in it do their jobs diligently, and professionally, but somewhere in either the writing, or the directing, or both, something is amiss.It honestly wouldn't have taken much to make this mediocre film into something much more memorable. It's the whole void of logic thing that ruins it.When you watch films like this you are constantly thinking what you would do in the exact same situation, and when the film deviates from what most would do is when that immersion gets lost. Unfortunately this happened way too many times for this movie to be salvageable.Spoilers ahead!.....From the very 1st drops of water falling from the ceiling in the living room any thinking person would be like ""hum, we better see what we can do about that before the roof caves in"". I mean seriously an 8 year old would have the sense that water from the ceiling is bad, and it will only get worse. Apparently these 2 educated, late teen-early 20 somethings didn't have that notion, and guess what happens! This is just one of the many easily foreseeable blunders that plague this movie. There are a couple of times where after we know society is crumbling, and the girls might not be safe, and they have a gun yet they don't keep it with them when they sleep...not even in the same room? Or like when the girls for some ridiculous reason decide to leave the fortification of their home to go into the woods to a hollowed out tree to have the baby. Now in the scene just before they smell smoke from a fire that is not their own...so they know strangers are near, but do they think to bring the gun with them to have this baby? At this point I was like ""Oh come on, gimme a break"".This film just kept rolling them out is this fashion, and although I really wanted to like it, eventually you just hit a point where these faux pas' just can't be forgiven."
" Boring and unrealistic
",-0.3182,-0.8641,2017-05-19 00:00:00,4,"I had to hop on IMDb to validate my hunch this was written/directed by a woman. Lo and behold, it was. This isn't a surprise, as the vibe the movie gave off was very ""feministic"". Filled with disappointing male characters and plenty of completely unrealistic scenarios. For example, you're in survival mode. You're rationing what little food you have. What's the last thing you would do? Contemporary ballet. The same girl that's spending her time dancing decides to argue with her sister about the smallest piece of chocolate she ate without sharing. That sums up the logic of this movie. I'd like to think women aren't really that stupid in real life. Right after this scene, she's saying ""How long is he going to stay? We don't have much food left"". Somehow they manage to have food throughout the entire movie with little to no explanation. Sorry, but you won't be picking blueberries for a year, yet they seem to have an abundance of them like they live next to a blueberry farm. Then, after ~10 months, their roof caves in. On a seemingly recent, well built home, their roof caves in. You can drive out in the country and find dilapidated homes from the 60's with their roof still in tact, and I'm to believe that this upper class home is just going to randomly fall apart? Give me a break. The dancing girl decides to keep her rape baby (what could possibly go wrong?). What's the first thing she does after giving birth? ""I want to burn our house down"". ""How long have humans been around, 200 thousand years? We don't need this place!"" and thus ""Into the Forest"" they go. As if. Btw, despite having a ton of gasoline, let's use ALL of it to burn the house down. That's logical in a survival situation. I'm torn between thinking only a dumb woman could come up with such stupid ideas, or if the movie exemplifies women who come up with such stupid ideas. It's a conundrum, really. P.S. Ellen Page is an annoying, horrible actress."

To summarise what the film lacks: There is no backstory about why the economy is collapsing; the two girls are just victims with no heroics supplied.

It's falls into the category of Hard Science as the situation is near believable. Though you can't help watching it and waiting for the other ball to drop, and it never happens. No zombies, No killer robots from the future, no alien invasion.And without all this Into the Forest was still able to produce a dramatically intense concept of the human condition when the apocalypse happens. who will raise up, who can't, and who will show their true colors. The specific focus is own two sisters who had to learn to fend for themselves without technology after their father dies in an accident and because of the apocalypse they could not get to a doctor in time.A well done tale of true dystopia."
" It would have been better IF...
",0.4404,0.7264,2017-02-09 00:00:00,6,"Unsure of what to expect, I found this movie to be quite enjoyable. However the one issue I have is with their home. Who is living in a home that begins falling in withing two years?The other aspects of survival are important in a situation such as they found themselves in this movie.You need to be able to protect yourself. You need to have others with you. You need to know how to survive.And most important, you need to want to survive.The pregnancy, despite the circumstances gave these characters the will to survive."
" A different sort of chick flick
",0.0,0.8316,2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"Enjoyed it a lot. Slow but convincing; well written, well-made, well-acted.My guess is that 98% of those who hated it simply object to the idea of a post-apocalyptic film that isn't about men saving the day. Hence the broad vein of affront at the decisions the sisters make. The unspoken implication is that a couple of husky young Aryan preppers would have sorted them out.... and (more important) learned them to be good, obedient wives that knowed their place.I'm sure there are any number of films the haters here would hate just as much - but don't feel the need to pan. That's because they haven't gone to watch them by mistake, imagining they're going to be rewarded with another pandering, exploitative affirmation of identities rooted - if we're being honest -in always making the easiest choice."
" Bleak
",0.0,0.8287,2017-02-06 00:00:00,1,"Absolute waste of my life watching this film, it was described as a thriller but it definitely wasn't, most depressing, boring and senseless film I've ever watched! You don't even get to find out why they had a power cut, or if they ever got it back or anything! Just a terrible film, the story lines didn't even make sense and were just ridiculous to the point of annoying. The ending was awful. Bleak is definitely the word I would use for it! So annoyed that I watched it to the end hoping it would get better, just turn it off people honestly. I actually really like Ellen Page as well so I was very disappointed. Only thing I can say is that the scenery was quite nice with the forest surrounding the house"
" A somewhat implausible End of the World movie that struggles with pace
",-0.3612,-0.9703,2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"Another in a seemingly endless string of movies about going into the woods sees a small family unit of dad and two older daughters surviving after a mysterious power outage hits the country.The movie is set in the near future, as we see from somewhat more sophisticated computer interfaces in the home. Strangely, this is where the technology ends, as our trio is left woefully unprepared for when the disaster strikes. They are living at a beautiful forest home, yet have no gas for the jenny and the solar panels do not work.... uh yeah.....The strange disruption of the radio signals is also very unexplained.So with the cause, ramifications, extent, etc of this catastrophe left blank and with that, a lot of suspicion on just how much the director thought this through when there are plenty of real world disasters available (solar flare? magnetic pole flip? Gamma ray burst?) we are left with 'Oh... OK... just a PLOT DEVICE...' to move on with. Which means, the story and the acting and the plot better be freaking GOOD....Instead, we see the small family unit go through classic denial stage, then depression, then motivation stages. There are only two major plot crisis events in the movie, and at times we are left with wondering the ultimate purpose... as the movie starts to seem like a survival instructional video, then slides into a 'sisters 4eva!' girl power movie.Another very strange point... their gorgeous forest bungalow home begins to self destruct for some reason after only 6 months... and is unlivable after 1 1/2 years.... not saying much for modern construction! No explanation for this very weird self destructing house (and those reading who are lazy on cleaning gutters, please rest easy - it takes YEARS of not cleaning them before the roof starts caving in...)I didn't score lower, because, despite the many flaws, the actors themselves are top notch and bring their A game, and the beautiful setting is magic to get absorbed in, you can almost smell the pine."
" Just not good enough..
",-0.3412,0.9878,2017-01-29 00:00:00,4,"(First of all, this is my first review, so please bare with me.)I tried my very best to like this movie, but I just couldn't. Some people might love it, for me it just wasn't good enough. As most movies, it has it's pro's and cons. Let me start off with the pro's: - It has some great cinematics, the location of shooting was wonderful, which made it a pleasure to watch. -The camera-work was pretty on point to, it never really had an awkward point of view and everything was well captured. - Acting was well done.So why did I give it a 4/10? The writing. It ruined what could've been a great movie. The idea was nice, but the result wasn't. The main plot was clear since the start movie, but it had TOO much holes. Why? How? What now? Instead, it started to focus on more unnecessary things. Some scenes were too long without any clear reason or addition, which made the experience a lot more boring. A lot of (small) things just didn't make sense; a lot of weird decisions and actions of the characters. I wasn't pleased with the ending too, it could've made the movie plot a lot better.All in all, bad writing ruined this movie. You might enjoy it more if you're not thinking too realistic, but for me, it just wasn't the case. How hard I even tried."
" Coming of age story of two sisters, their relationship, while the outside world presumably shuts down.
",0.0,0.943,2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Well acted and beautifully shot. I was entertained throughout. Beautiful scenery and lovely trees. Most likely shot in the Pacific Northwest. The only problem I had with the movie was the reviews that it prompted. These are some of the worse nonsensical reviews that I have ever read. I have completely lost my faith in humanity and human intelligence. If you are looking for another superhero movie, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a story of sisters trying to overcome their situation, enjoy. Read a few and decide for yourself. Humanity has no chance.I suppose they could have built a hydro-electric plant."
" Ellen Page wouldn't know a good story if she read it in a book
",-0.3412,-0.5195,2017-01-21 00:00:00,2,"Two great actresses go to a forest to conduct a train wreck. No spoilers. I'm not giving away anything. Watch it if you must. I suggest you delete this from your watch-list.The actors are as great as ever -- the story is a book to burn for warmth. This movie is well acted and gripping in its intensity, but I can only warn other viewers, its third act collapses and the movie ends preposterously. Just inexplicable. It starts to stink pretty early on when it becomes apparent the editing or ad hoc screen writing started to jump around with implausible leaps.It's so bad, you'd rather the ending was ""woke up and it was all a dream."" Again, no spoilers, the plot has nothing to do with a dream or surreal adventure (though I wish it were so.) It's a stinker of a movie."
" How to not survive when the power goes out.
",0.0,0.1415,2017-01-15 00:00:00,1,"At first I thought it was going to be little interesting to see how they all survive, but as the movie goes on you find out the characters are the kind that would not survive any kind of apocalypse in the long term. If that's the point of this movie, then they nailed it. The movie might seem like it has a good ending, but in reality they wouldn't last a week with an infant without a decent shelter. Deciding to burn the house down because of 'black mold' and then living in a tree stump while it's beating down rain (and winter is coming soon) is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. They could have fixed the roof eventually, or at least weatherproofed it. Or they could have just found another house, since they were all abandoned. Instead they decide to live outside with an infant. Just plain stupidity."
" Great Acting, Not So Great Script
",0.8481,0.7718,2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Two young sisters tough out a lengthy power outage in a house deep in the woods. With supplies dwindling, people becoming more feral and desperate, the sisters must make a decision to either ride out the crisis in the relative safety of their home, or make a long, dangerous journey to a place rumored to have some semblance of civilization. ""Into The Forest"" is saved from a failing grade had it not been for the great performances of Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood (playing the sisters); and the fine cinematography by Daniel Grant. Many of the decisions the sisters make will just leave you going ""huh, what the hell?"" For example: Wood dancing every day for months, using up so many calories, calories that cannot easily be replenished as their food supply is decreasinginstead of going into survival mode, she keeps practicing as if the world will be back to normal any day now, despite 4 or 6 months of no power. Oh, well, not every movie can have a great script. My most memorable, movie moment of ""Into The Forest"" is the scene when Wood, after a traumatic event, refuses to take the last aspirin, telling Page to ""save it."" Page insists Wood take the entire tablet, and Wood says she'll just take half. It's a wonderful and painful scene of the love the sisters have for each other, and how much each is willing to sacrifice for the other.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Nature, at its best and worst
",0.0258,0.9878,2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"I was actually not looking forward to this movie at all because I tried to read the book beforehand and couldn't finish it. Not to mention I find director Patricia Rozema a hit or miss director and Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood are far from my favourite actresses. But maybe it's because I went into this with such low expectations that I ended up being completely blown away. Page and Wood play two teenage sisters (despite looking nothing like teenagers or each other), who live in a remote woodland area (which is clearly in B.C. but pretending to be somewhere in the U.S.) with their handy father. They live in a slightly futuristic time where computers are slightly advanced. One day the power goes out which poses a minor inconvenience for them. But then the outage continues and things start to go awry. People get desperate. And this small family has to struggle to come together to survive. The story honestly isn't particularly unique but Rozema, taking her cues from the novel of the same name, puts a surprising twist on certain actions. The characters find hope in dire situations and in each other. And Rozema truly has a breath taking eye for capturing images. There are so many moments that took my breath away because of how beautifully she framed them. Cinematographer Daniel Grant also deserves a shout out for his truly beautiful work. By no means a perfect movie, this one is still worth watching if you keep an open mind."
