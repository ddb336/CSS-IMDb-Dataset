",0.0,0.9633,2021-04-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie is freakin awesome, its honestly one of the best horror movies in years. In a age when everyone uses cgi the void goes old school with their special effects and it looks great. This is what hellraiser was supposed to be i only hope they make a second one. This is a movie you can watch multiple times and love it every single time. Highly recommended to real horror fans."
" Best part of the movie was the trailer.
",0.6369,0.9736,2021-04-01 00:00:00,1,"Don't get me wrong had me interested in the beginning, but as the ""movie"" progressed it started to get off track (like derailed). The plot was all over the place and they never really explained anything in the movie, like why is the one guy mute? Why are they praising this triangle? It's never explained and they call it the abyss, the name of the movie is called THE VOID! (Not mentioned at all). Would not recommend unless you want to be high and have a cheap laugh. Go watch hellraiser or the thing if you want a better movie. Idk who in the right mind would give this movie more then 1 star. There are much better b movies out there."
" Wants to be event Horizon butfalls flat
",0.0,0.966,2021-03-20 00:00:00,4,"This film was clearly inspired by Event Horizon plus a few other films ( The Mist, Sunshine, Hellraiser silent hill), but for me it didnt pull it off and the last minute where husband and wife are in the void some other dimension, wouldve been better a movie to explore and conquer as a film and everything we just watched building upto that point shouldve just been crammed down to the beggining 1/3 of the movie. The white sheet worshippers just made the movie cheesy for me and the father son team, well the dad was so irritating. I agree with Quinosa1984 's review, characters were semi dimensional and not enough about symbols and void, but clearly the film was invented by someone with love some of the old classics"
" Lovecraftian!
",0.0,0.3891,2021-03-05 00:00:00,6,"This homage to HP Lovecraft begins promisingly. Sharply edited images of figures, glimpses of things, and an injured young man taken to an under-staffed hospital. Before long, staff and inmates seem to be transforming into extraordinary creatures.A distinct lack of CGI lends the many grotesque effects on display here a similarity to films like 'The Thing (1982)' and others from that era. They work very well for the most part.The story is at once fascinating and involving, but it's possible it exhausts itself before the film is over - as time rolls on, things remain just as frantic, but become confusing and overtly, well, 'cosmic'. This is fitting in a Lovecraftian kind of way, of course, but in a bid to top the wonderfully revolting creatures and situations we witness along the way, it loses its way a bit toward the end. My score is 6 out of 10."
" Lovecraft meets Body-horror
",0.0,0.9588,2021-02-22 00:00:00,6,"While the pacing and plot are a little messy, I had a good time with this one.
The creature and costume design is excellent, and the over-arching story was definitely interesting.
Aaron Poole did a great job in the lead, and while the rest of the cast did a fairly average job acting, it wasn't bad enough to ruin the movie.Overall, an enjoyable and pretty unique little horror/thriller!
6/10"
" Chaotic, but has it all
",-0.2732,0.4404,2021-02-20 00:00:00,6,"A chaotic but entertaining mix that borrows from 'The Thing', 'Hellraiser', 'In the Mouth of Madness' and a sniff of 'Alien' while still feeling original like a 80/90's gem that was lost and now found."
" At first worth a watch for the comedy value alone, but then it gets very tedious.
",0.34,0.8166,2021-02-03 00:00:00,2,How are people really giving this serious positive reviews? The writing is so inept that you would think it was written by Children. If you don't like watching things for their comedy value give it a miss it won't do your blood pressure any good.
" Bad and worst movie
",-0.8225,-0.8316,2021-01-28 00:00:00,1,Worst of the worst its only waste time really i cant understand who will enjoy it
" B list quality with a better budget
",0.4404,0.9599,2021-01-28 00:00:00,5,"O B-list horror movies are sometimes a better way to go - you're more likely to get stories and directors who care about their projects, rather than a gore-fest money grab like every major horror to come out these days. However, this does not guarantee quality. Often the trade-offs of budget and acting quality are pretty obvious, and these can be as detrimental as a lack of ambition. The Void is a weird mix of both: some decent money was obviously spent with a story in mind, but this falls away in the second half, leaving behind a bang-average film with below average acting. I was pretty invested to begin with, but there's a lot of bark without much bite. Most of the people you meet are pretty inconsequential, and the main characters really can't act much. Visually this actually performs pretty well, some Cronenberg-esque graphics never hurting, but past that, there isn't much to warrant recommending the Void to anyone."
" You'll either love it or hate it
",0.128,0.3776,2021-01-17 00:00:00,8,"This is a ""Marmite"" movie. If you're a fan of 80""s horror, you will ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS FILM. If you're not - you will not enjoy it.It's like Hellraiser, The Thing and Rosemary's baby came together and made a phenomenal tribute to the classic 80's genre. But if you haven't seen or didn't enjoy those films - don't bother watching this.I found this an utterly underrated triumph. I was terrified, bemused, and hugely entertained."
" Classic horror
",-0.5719,-0.7492,2021-01-06 00:00:00,9,Not sure about the plot but if you love classic 80s style horror then this is for you. Unrelenting hard core horror in the vein of Hellraiser.
" OK - Nice Try
",0.694,-0.5724,2021-01-04 00:00:00,5,"Having been on the planet for over 50 years and seen quite a few horror movies I have a good feel for what works and what doesn't.
After watching this film I thought it was a brilliant story but just not executed as well as other top horror films. One of my main gripes was the portrayal of the cop Daniel.
Right from the start I just didn't get the sense that this was a cop - he came across more like a high school kid that had stolen a uniform- the character did not have any strength or toughness or display any sort of in your face resilience except when the script demanded when he would suddenly spit out some aggressive lines which when they came seemed at odds with his character. Much of the time he could not look other characters in the eye - not what you would expect of an experienced lawman.
Top marks go to the practical effects designers - this is always nice to see in films these days. Again this was a little spoilt as much of these effects were in darkness or poorly lit places with fast editing - especially in the first monster reveal.
The film moved at a very good pace and at the end I was not blown away and felt that it was a very average film - just disappointed it could have been so much better - I loved the story as it harked back to many classic films but was sad that it didn't quite reach their heights."
" Excellent Indie Lovecraft Film
",0.5719,0.5145,2021-01-01 00:00:00,9,I cannot sing the praises of this low budget film enough. They did an excellent job with the mounting horror and effects (honestly so gory and believable despite the low budget - we were actually creeped out). One of the best Lovecraftian films I have seen ever. I expect great things in the future for these filmmakers.
" Defying death thru metamorphism older than god
",-0.4215,-0.9765,2020-12-09 00:00:00,8,"A police officer of the town sees a man crawling on the road and takes him to the hospital. In the hospital are there a grandfather with his pregnant granddaughter, Danny the police officers wife Allison, the nurse intern Kim and the two shooter guys and doctor Richard. A nurse Beverly is found poking a patient's eyes with scissors and Danny killed her while she's coming at her. And then she metamorphosed into a creature with tentacles from the mouth. The effects were very impressive. Then the creature attacked the doctor and the shooter guys beheaded the doc before he was possesed as well. And then they put him in the morgue. There were disciples outside waiting encircled the hospital. They were wearing a white gown with a triangle on their faces. They weren't attaching they were preventing them from leaving the hospital. Danny with other 2 guys and the meth head goes out to the patrol car to take ammo and Allison goes alone to the medicine room where she was attacked by doctor Richard. He took him to the endless labyrinths of the basement in the hospital where he practiced how to defy god and avoid death to bring her past daughter back. Danny and others goes down to the basement and it was sheer hell with creatures that the doctor made attacking them. In the surgical room doctor made Allison into the mother creature with tentacles as she also lost his child but Danny found her and as he noticed she was transformed he butchered her with an axe. Then the ritual of the doctor bringing her daughter back started. It turns out he was using the pregnant girls body as the vessel. She gets up from the floor where she was lying in laboring pain and slits her grandfathers throat but Kim the intern could escape. She descends to the ritual and becomes the daughter creature like the father creature while a triangle was glowing with white light in the wall. And Danny managed to throw both of them into the glowing light. The younger shooter guy escaped the basement realm and got back to the hospital and Kim was the only survivor besides him. Danny with his wife Allison was in another dimension looking at a giant pyramid under dark clouds. Overall the non CGI effects were so satisfying and although the son and dad's back story was a bit vague and the opening scene they killed a girl who's probably possessed and couldn't save their family maybe but in the end the whole story of defying death and becoming by becoming a monster has a solid story and the disciples outside gave even a more chilling atmosphere to the film."
" A good modern horror
",-0.2023,-0.4118,2020-11-19 00:00:00,8,"This was a good solid horror, the pacing is fairly straight to the point, but with some things not immediately given away to the audience. The storyline is interesting though some things left open to interpretation.
There's also not much CGI if any, lots of animatronics/prosthetics like proper old skool horrors. As such the gore in this is really quite realistic, it reminded me of The Thing. Not one to watch whilst eating if you've a weak stomach.Overall a quite solid horror, mostly solid acting and just enough backstory for the main character (and others) to not feel too unattached. I'd recommend this."
" The Null and . . .
",0.0,-0.4592,2020-11-19 00:00:00,5,"Having recently watched the low budget horror ""10/31"" and the Lovecraft adaptation ""Colour Out of Space"" on Amazon, the algorithm naturally combined the two for me today and selected ""The Void"". A 2016 crowdfunded film, that whilst not a straight adaptation of Lovecraft, owes much to the old gods style mythos, as well as nods to the body horror of David Cronenberg and John Carpenters ""Prince of Darkness"". It is, unfortunately, not as well done as any of the other movies mentioned.State Trooper Daniel Carter (Aaron Poole) discovers a young man crawling for his life by the roadside. He delivers him to nearest hospital, that is in the process of being closed down following a fire, and where Allison (Kathleen Munroe), his ex-wife, works. The hospital is then surrounded by a number of cloaked figures, each brandishing a knife. As Carter and the skeleton crew look to barricade the doors, it becomes apparent that group aren't trying to get it, but rather keep them inside with the otherworldly evil that is already present.For a low budget film, the performances here's aren't that bad. There are a few recognisable faces, perhaps none more so than Ellen Wong of ""Scott Pilgrim"" fame. The many gory visual effects are mostly done practically, and sometimes work well - the bonded flesh creatures though, that populate much of the ending of the film are a bit of a ill-defined mess. Everything on a technical level is pretty solid though.It's the story where the film lost me. I liked its Macro elements, if you like. The portals, the ancient tentacled evil, the human sacrifice, guilt and shame personified - but its more specific story elements were so ill-defined that they undercut the film. There are several times that it's implied that what we're seeing is someone's delusion, but those are inconsistent with secondary characters present in the scenes. We're never really told what the deal is with The Father and The Son, how they stumbled across what's happening, or what their goal is.What I want is a remake, with a little more funding and a better, more logical version of the story, this one, whilst occasionally promising, doesn't deliver."
" Jon carpenters the thing meets hellraiser
",0.0,0.9873,2020-11-18 00:00:00,9,"Anyone who is a fan off creature films will enjoy this movie. It's shocking it's not got an higher rating. It has the great visuals of the thing (no rubbish CGI here) with a kinda Hellraiser feel to it you will see what I mean if you choose to watch it. It's been on my recommended list from prime for some time but I kept putting of watching it due to the poor score on here, but I'm glad I finally gave it a go. Anyone who enjoys the old school 80s style effects and makeup horror will like this film. don't get me wrong it's no Jon Carpenters the Thing, but that's a masterpiece and one of a kind but I highly recommend this film all the same. The effect are brilliant, the acting is good. The story is pretty weird but I'm fine with that. To sum up ignore the rating score on here and give it a watch."

" Lots of bang for practically no buck!
",-0.3595,0.7743,2020-11-02 00:00:00,8,"With a minute budget of just $82.000 this movie is an awesome tribute to everything John Carpenter, HP Lovecraft and gory creature feature.
By no means very original story-wise, but highly recommendable for independent movie making fun. The practical effects are skillfully achieved, that some big budget studios can take notes on.
There are some problems with the narrative, which can get a bit messy in times during the latter half. But overall;
Great horror flick fun!"
" Zero effort in the script
",0.0,-0.9187,2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Ok, so the practical effects are passable but the camera cuts so much and doesn't ever cut to a wide shot so it's the kind of stuff I could film with a bag of fake blood and a few baguettes.
The SCRIPT. My god it is awful. Some lines really seem like it's just the wrong person saying it (maybe that's the director's fault). And the plot seems to be going somewhere before it goes all occult which is the biggest cop out in all horror writing."
" The last 30 min are a bit weak
",-0.4404,0.9137,2020-10-31 00:00:00,7,"The Void is pretty well made. It's not scary, but it is fun to watch. However, the last half hour could have been much better. Before the last 30 min kick in, this movie was probably an 8/10.Even so, it's still worth a watch if you like lovecraftian horror."
" Bloody, Occult Terror-ride
",-0.4404,0.0387,2020-10-30 00:00:00,7,"On the face of it, just another 80s homage but one that becomes it's own bloody, occult, terror-ride. It has a few issues, including some flat performances, but still well worth your time."
" Worth it
",0.2263,0.8002,2020-10-24 00:00:00,7,"So the bar is pretty low for horror movies theses days, with that in mind, this movie is enjoyable. It starts off at 100 and delivers a solid first half. The last half is a little slow and silly but the first half makes it worth it. I enjoyed it."

One of the best horror films I've ever watched.
An absolute classic."
" A harsh review from a Lovecraft fan.
",-0.1531,-0.9294,2020-10-20 00:00:00,5,"One cannot critique this film without bringing up H.P. Lovecraft. Before I go on I must say I am an avid fan of Lovecraft and have studied all of his work and story telling methods.That being said I would like to say this movie had some of the best practical effects, art direction and visuals I've seen in a very long time. This is truly the movie's saving grace if it has one. I found it heartbreaking that such great effects were, in my opinion, wasted in a poor attempt at capturing Lovecraft's essence.Before I go on, l want to apologize for anyone out there that got a rise out of this movie. I think it's great if you were able to enjoy it. In a way I sort of did, but not in the Lovecraftian sense. Everything I'm about to say is a personal opinion and is often the root of every ""Lovecraftian"" film debate. But hear me out.The fear of the unknown is what makes Lovecraft stories great. Not cults, tentacles, gods, aliens, alternate dimensions, or monsters. Metaphorically speaking, Lovecraft, in terms of story, gives you a Skeleton and the skin. It's up to the reader to imagine the flesh in between. This is the unknown factor. In my opinion, the Void had no skeleton, only flesh and skin. And what do I mean by skeleton? Structure. Rules. Foundation. When a Lovecraft character goes mad, it's almost always because he has a revelation... usually stated in the stories last paragraph. A huge mind-F. A mind-F that makes complete logical sense upon seeing that one final thing. This movie, in my opinion, makes no logical sense. And the last scene was no revelation, just a weird and unusual thing.It's okay to leave us guessing when we get to C, but how have we gotten from A to B? Or maybe we know exactly where we are at at C, and we were confused and speculating from A to B. The fear of the unknown should only fill in one or two letters, never all three. This is what makes Lovecraft's good stories so great. You can't leave us in the dark for A, B, AND C. You have to ground us a little bit in at least one of those letters. I'm hoping my strange analogy is making sense. It's hard to put in words.Let's bring up In the Mountains of Madness (my favorite Lovecraft story). So imagine if those scientist never theorized what all those hieroglyphics were saying, or didn't read the maps. Or the geologist didn't get take his rock samples... you'd have a bunch of explorers going into a cave, finding some dead monsters, monsters come back to life and kill everyone, some guys go looking for them in some ancient ruins and are chased out by a monster blob with eyeballs, then while flying away they notice another ancient ruined city on the horizon. Would you like that story? What makes it a good story is we know about the elder things, the shoggath slaves, the wars, the creation of humans (which is practically irrelevant), this giant and structured mythos of terrifying proportions that make all of mankind seem insignificant. There's structure there. And the fear of the unknown is what that man sees from the plane that drives him mad. Otherwise, we have a fairly good idea of everything going on in that story. Even if the explorers are just theorizing.The Void's story to me feels very random. Let's throw in a cult, tentacles, another dimension... where's the structure? It has some very loose ideas going on as far as plot, but not enough. Maybe if the film was slowed down and longer, then the onion could be peeled a little slower and the mystery behind it all could be revealed in a way that's more developed. Maybe the ideas behind this story need to span more time? Or we could have read aloud some of that little book the father found...Lovecraft's stories stories make sense to me. Even when things are left open to interpretation. This film just didn't make sense to me. It had all the visuals of a Lovecraft story but I just didn't feel connected to it. In Lovecraft's stories I'm always able to connect the dots. The Void to me just didn't even have any dots. It was a jumbled mess of wavy lines.So, that may sound confusing to you reading this... but I hope at least one of you understands what it is I'm trying to say. If you're able to make any kind of logical sense out of this movies plot, that's great and I envy you. Because I really did think it was excellent eye candy. The acting was alright too. The thing is that Lovecraft's stories to me never feel like a jumbled mess. I needed more detail story wise. I believe this could have been achieved while still giving us a healthy fear of the unknown."
" Elixir of Nonsense
",-0.4019,0.0516,2020-10-09 00:00:00,1,"Pure, unadulterated nonsense.Nothing and I do mean nothing makes any sense in this film. Most films you expect to draw nearer to some sort of understanding or conclusion as the film goes on. Not this one. Expect higher and higher levels of nonsense all the way to the finish line. If you're looking for a good story - stay away. Do you get your kicks from blood, gore and totally needless profanity? This may be for you."

Nobody portrayed isolation and losing your mind like that could guy could describe in words.This is by far the most faithful lovecraft inspired film I've seen. The characters are hopeless and are trapped and by the end their losing their minds seeing what they have seen. Knowing what they know.It's also just a call back to horror in general practical effects rubber suits! It's cool and I'm excited to see what these guys come up with next.

",0.0,-0.5732,2020-09-15 00:00:00,6,"This isn't perfect but it's not a bad watch if you are in the mood for a creepy, gory siege flick in a hospital that descends into hell. There's a good mix of entertaining chracters and a few annoying ones. It starts out creepy but descends much further as the movie progresses. The atmosphere is generally maintained well and there are a few scary scenes too. Not fantastic but worth a watch if you enjoy the genre."

" An exciting Lovecraftian story
",0.4939,-0.9681,2020-08-22 00:00:00,6,"This review contains spoilers.The Void is a low budget horror movie with Lovecraftian themes. The story follows a sheriff that discovers a wounded man. The two drive to the local hospital but then discover a mysterious cult surrounds them. The sheriff along with the hospital's patients, nurses, and doctors desperately try to survive against the cosmic horror before them.The Void is an excellent movie with Lovecraftian themes. it is a movie that has a low budget but executes its story and themes well. Audiences should be warned that the story does become wild and strange. This feeds into the theme of cosmic horror well as many horrific occurrences are not explained and not understood. The audience only understands as much as the main characters do and even this is open to the character's dwindling sanity as the horror envelops them. I liked all of the characters and they are well written. The story has enough twists to keep it engaging and to keep the audience guessing.The budget of the movie low. This is evident in most of the movie taking place in one location with confined spaces. This does work to the benefit of the movie as it contributes to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie. The monsters in this movie are not well realized. The monsters are shown too much on the screen where they lose their weight. With the low budget it can be easy to pick apart messy details on the monsters. The monsters do look horrific at first but become static as the screen time goes on.The actors and actresses did a good job in this movie. The only complaint I have is the lack of range. Most of the characters are reacting to horror. The actors and actresses were fine for this purpose but were not fully tested. Likewise, the dialogue was well written.There are some story problems. Since, the movie does not explain actions, some events are open to interpretation. Once it is revealed that the hospital's doctor was behind the events, some of the plot does not make much sense. The doctor was able to reincarnate and serve his eldritch god. He also wanted to bring back his daughter. it seemed as if he could have killed the other characters before the movie started or even have caused character deaths to aid in his plans. This is still open to interpretation and I am glad the movie ended the way it did.I highly recommend The Void. It is a movie with heavy Lovecraftian inspiration. The movie is a must watch for any fan of Lovecraft.Grade: A"

" Lovecraft done well.
",0.2732,0.8268,2020-08-07 00:00:00,7,"Lovecraftian horror is rarely seen done properly in film and is quite a treat for the senses when it is. The Void is (in my opinion) one such film. While watching The Void I kept having flashbacks to films like Hellraiser, The Thing, The Mist, etc. And although it isn't quite up to the standard of those films, it's definitely not far off. The effects are the real stars here, everything is masterfully crafted and the practical element makes for a much more immersive experience, knowing that the actors could actually reach out and touch the monsters really helps sell it, and I think it probably helped the actors too. The film doesn't try to explain itself all that much, only giving you breadcrumbs of a story, which I can see people taking problem with but this is Lovecraft, you're not supposed to understand what's going on, the whole idea is that your brain wouldn't be able to comprehend it and to that end, The Void succeeds also. I will say though, that the editing can be a little jarring at times and certain creative choices, like the flashing lights during the first monster encounter can feel quite egregious and headache inducing. Although certainly a flawed film I feel The Void is a must for lovers of Lovecraftian Horror, Cosmic Horror, Body Horror and 80s Sci-Fi. I'm gonna give it a 7/10"
" ""I see a monster who thinks he's god"".
",0.0,0.9705,2020-08-07 00:00:00,5,"You like John Carpenter, how about Clive Barker, you know you can't go wrong with H.P Lovecraft and Lucio Fulci shouldn't be forgotten. Well, let's chuck 'em in a blender and see what we get; Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski's brooding, traumatic cosmic horror ""THE VOID"". Truly a thing of nightmares. Now was mixing all those together a good idea? In foresight, yeah, why not? The final result, for me at least, was entertaining, yet a disconnected mess. I won't knock its vision, as the twisted practical make-up/special effects were outstanding and a dread-inducing siege atmosphere is laid on thick, but it borrowed heavily upon its influences making it hard not to think of those better films, instead of what was in front of me. I thought with it not making much sense, things just happening with an emphasis on loud sound fx and being light on narrative structure, only magnified its loosely tied throwback ideas. Again, I enjoyed it in parts. Some set-pieces worked better than others. Performances are able, even if there's not much to work off making it hard to connect or feel anything. In the end it looks great, but I just found the plot to meander and none of the nightmarish visuals and pulsating intensity to be unnerving."
" A surprising low budget horror film
",-0.5719,-0.7526,2020-08-06 00:00:00,5,"One night outside a rural town in Canada, a police officer finds an injured man in the road and takes him to a small local hospital which suddenely finds itself under siege from a mysterious hooded cult and a possible creature within the hospital.The plot and many elements in the film are a mash up from a bunch of horror films and especially ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976). Despite some elements lacking in originality, the film handles itself well on a small budget and stands up well against bigger budgeted films, adding a decent sense of tension, even if the climax of the film lacks the clever subtelty and surprises of much of the film."

What The Void does well, is hark back to classic Horror films that you wouldn't be surprised if Carpenter or Cronenberg had made. The Void gets better as it goes on and the special effects are excellent.I'm slightly surprised I'm giving a 7 rating but I guess I enjoyed the special effects and atmosphere despite the plot and acting.

" A surprisingly enjoyable hidden gem
",0.6249,-0.856,2020-06-19 00:00:00,8,"This was definitely an experience to watch. With the brutal opening kill, I thought Vincent and Simon were the villains, but the true villains quickly emerged as the grotesque abominations of this film. The only weak point, in my opinion, was a lack of explanation as to who this cult is, how Dr. Powell gained the knowledge, etc, though it doesn't ruin the movie for me. It almost feels like a video game adaptation of a game I've never played before, but now want to, as it gives off serious Resident Evil, Remnant: From The Ashes, and Bloodborne vibes. Visually horrific in the best way, and with an ominous presentation via the transforming Dr. Powell leading Daniel and the viewer down a dark path, ending in a question that I'm sure most of us have asked ourselves at least once in our lives; how far would we go to bring back the ones we love?"
" Bring your shotgun... locked and loaded!
",0.0,0.9061,2020-06-01 00:00:00,7,"This was quite a surprise. I sat down to ""The Void"" expecting just the usual, low-budget late-night horror flick. Easy to follow, nothing memorable. Just enough to kill the time into the early hours of the morning. Your standard set-up; a cop out on the graveyard shift comes across a man who needs a bit of help. He's been out drinking and god-knows what else, so the cop drives him to the local hospital, which is in transition, and the skeleton staff are currently packing up and getting ready to go. But when he gets there and drops the guy off, the cop finds that the hospital is surrounded by strange, hooded individuals, armed and menacing. As this hospital is out in the middle of nowhere, the pertinent thing to do is to barricade the people who are in the hospital inside and wait for help. This was all standard enough and looked set to be a good killer-outside thriller. But then things get a hell of a lot crazier...There is a certain allure about ""The Void"" that leaves me in no doubt that it is one I will be revisiting in the future, and might just get better. For the moment, it's just missing something. But the gore is great, the action plentiful and the special effects better than expected. The creatures/whatever they are, look fantastic. As a vast amount of reviews have indicated, this is highly evocative of '80s horror, with gore reminiscent of Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" and imagery very much along the lines of ""Hellraiser"" (But ""The Void"" is a superior film to that one). Not to mention John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". All that aside, ""The Void"" does just enough for itself to credit it with being its own film. The acting could have been better and the story does meander a fair bit and, I'm afraid to say, stretches the realm of belief a little too far by the end. Perhaps it was trying too much? Or maybe that's the allure I was talking about. Another viewing will tell."

" A Completely Biased Review
",-0.3384,-0.9869,2020-04-03 00:00:00,8,"All the characters are shoved into a little country hospital, with half of the building burned out from a major fire not too long ago. Outside are crowds of menacing cultists, dressed head-to-toe in white save for a black triangle in front of their faces. Inside dead bodies are piling up as something starts warping their flesh. Later on the weirdness gets dialed up with a portal to another dimension, and funky shenanigans with space and time, all the while littered with unimaginable horrors spawned from the all-encompassing loss of children.The Void is an extremely low budget film, and it some regards it shows. The acting talent across the board isn't exactly stellar, often feeling more like a TV movie on Syfy than a feature-length movie, and the single-location was a sure money-saver as well. There's also a few hiccups where you can tell funding was a problem, as with a police officer getting dragged off by a creature, in front of everyone, but annoyingly off-camera. On the flipside though, there are elements of The Void that don't appear cheap at all. The creature effects are astounding, especially considering they were all practical. Sure there's some quick cuts and dark lighting to conceal the rougher edges, but it actually added to the movie's cosmic horror angle; of creatures so indescribable to look upon.The pacing can feel a little off at times, but I'm not sure that was something easy to avoid. The film starts out fairly action-driven, with a fast pace that draws you in instantly. However, as it approaches the third act, the film slows right down in order to dwell in the atmosphere. The fast pace was unsustainable and ill-suited to the creeping horror the film evolves into, but likewise the slow brood and vaguery would've been too dull for the film's opening moments where the darker elements hadn't even been introduced yet. It felt a little jarring for sure, but it meant the pacing shifted nicely alongside the movie's tone and atmosphere.For me though, The Void gets thumbs up all over just for its story. The plot is a little lacking with a whole heap of unexplained nonsense, but in the wonderful world of cosmic horror, explanations aren't welcome anyway. The big bad vaguely explaining nothing was delectable, the hidden character motivations that never get revealed felt ripped from the pages of Lovecraft, and the threat of horrors beyond is all that was necessary to cause goosebumps. Explaining it like Event Horizon did with the portal to hell would've cheapened the experience. The Void is not hell, it's something else, something more, something far less cliché.In all The Void is far from a perfect movie. It's a low-budget indie affair that does a fantastic job of covering that fact up, beyond the few aspects where it really shows. It's like Event Horizon, Color Out of Space, Prince of Darkness, Silent Hill, The Thing, The Fly, Hellraiser, Beyond the Black Rainbow, or anything written by Lovecraft smooshed into one movie. It's pure nonsense filled with larger-than-life concepts and some incredible practical effects. I give it a solid and completely biased 8/10."

On a large level is this lovecraftian horror movie, the feeling of dread and disempowerment, trying to fight something inevitable, bigger than oneself, something you don't even know or understand.

The practical FX are brilliant and it's a great 80s throwback to gore and darkness.
Where this falls down for me is the acting and editing. I don't want to be spoonfed my plot but this film does ask its audience to trust it at times when a little bit of detail would have been relevant.

" A horror movie that that proudly carves its influences into its claret-clogged chest
",-0.0258,0.3979,2020-01-05 00:00:00,6,"The Void is a Canadian horror movie that is a throwback to the days when splatter auteurs like John Carpenter, George Romero and Lucio Fulci ruled the drive-in. Co-directed by Steven Kostanski and Jeremy Gillespie (who had previously worked for Astron-6 creating comedic horror films such as Manborg, Father's Day and The Editor), the plot follows a small group of people who become trapped in a hospital by a gathering of hooded cultists, and by grotesque creatures. The movie was conceived after Gillespie overheard Guillermo del Toro (whilst working on the unfinished film At the Mountains of Madness) stating that he wanted to do a HP Lovecraft film in a way that hadn't been done before. Gillespie and Kostanski managed to crowdfund $82,510 to create the practical creature effects which are great and the highlight of the movie. The directors' love of old-school, honest-to-goodness, practical FX shines through, underpinning several showstopping outbursts of icky gore (including a scalpel in the eye, and a messy scene where a character gives birth to a monster). This will win the approval of diehard horror fans, but probably not the casual viewer who may find the plot of this sci-fi mystical horror hybrid getting more muddled as it grows more thematically ambitious."

" Ignore the Average Rating , Excellent Film
",0.296,0.9538,2019-12-01 00:00:00,9,"I often look for something, without fully knowing what exactly I'm looking for. Of course, I am talking about movies and that magic thing that some movies have and most others don't. When I watched this movie, I found what I was looking for, at that particular time. When it comes to Lovecraft's influence in movies, there are a lot of really good ones, like The Thing (1982) for example, that only borrow some of the elements from Lovecraft's stories, this is an indirect influence. But some movies(filmmakers) attempt to create that Lovecraft universe, directly, and most of these, sadly, make a poor job of that. This film was a surprising exception to that. And what is more impressive is they managed to make it with a seemingly very low budget. In order not to spoil the film, I won't get into the details. I just wanted to write this review to explain why this film has such an average rating and why you should ignore it. What I've learnt through the years about the average viewer is that they don't like an unsolved mystery or something they don't understand. They are used to Hollywood dumbing down and spelling everything out loud for them. But doesn't that defeat the purpose of a mystery? I believe, your average dumb viewer saw this and didn't understand what was going on. What was the void? Who were these cultist worshiping? Because there was not a cliched Skype call scene in the film to a professor for exposition, they didn't like it. But Lovecraft's horror is based on the fear of unknown and that is what makes it so good and we rarely get real mysteries in movies or TV because of the average viewer. Do you remember that scene in Game of Thrones when Jaqen H'gar changed his face when he first appeared on the show? It was such an uncanny and wonderfully mysterious character, I wish they had left it at that and that character had never appeared again. But later, they even show you how he changes his face, which takes away its mystery. I digress... Anyways, as I said, ignore the ratings and see it without prejudice. I bet, you'll love it."

",0.4019,-0.839,2019-08-10 00:00:00,6,"A decent film with a range of practical effects quite unique and attractive, giving an eighties touch reminiscent of classics like The Thing. It makes good use of such effects to provide a disturbing environment, reminiscent of the genre of cosmic horror and the culture developed through the works of the great horror author Lovecraft. The film shows scenes quite disturbing but attractive to experience thanks to such effects, which are missing in today's horror movies, this was a welcome feature that if not involved, would probably make this film much less enjoyable.But, even though being catalogued as a horror movie is quite smooth and enjoyable, at no time did it manage to create a scene of panic or tension through its duration. Being at times quite easy to see, without any truly terrifying scene; the film itself, manages to enter very well into what we would consider to be bodily horror. Which is a sub-genre that manages to provoke disturbing sensations, but not all movies of this type are capable of creating a truly terrifying atmosphere. However, despite this, the film compensates with a fast development, mysterious and short enough to keep us paying attention.The movie is decent, and a nice example of cosmic terror, though somewhat pretentious. The performances are... Well... they are typical horror movie performances so there's not much to say but they're mediocre. Even so, it is good to see that from time to time, from the pits of horror, a film is born ready to present the fascinating subgenre of Lovecraftian horror, even though it doesn't achieve it completely, it rubs it."

They never explain how, where or why the chaos started, but it really is immaterial. We soon learn what the film is all about and what the 'creature' wants. I didn't quite understand how the hooded figures fit into the story, as they looked similar to the Ku Klux Klan, but their presence is never explained or fully explored.The make-up, visuals and practical effects are incredible!

It could had been such a masterpiece of cosmic horror... ok, in Lovecraftian universe one must not worry about explanations. Things are there because there's a much bigger scheme behind everything, something a tiny puny human mind wouldn't understand and that's the beauty of it. Unfortunately, ""The Void"" is devoid (pun intended) of any explanations and it simply makes a mash up of cool aspects from Lovecraftian literature along with pieces of Hellraiser, Silent Hill and The Thing and the final by-product is messy and boring. To help, acting is not solid. I gave 5 out of 10 due to the practical fx, which are really good.
Other than that, there's no much fun. I would say... avoid The Void... but go ahead and watch it, if you're a die-hard horror fan like me and take your own conclusions."
" The convoluted baby of Hellraiser and The Thing
",0.0,-0.8632,2019-07-13 00:00:00,5,"Before I decided to watch the trailer and come to the conclusion that ""this looks wacky and thrilling, I think I'll watch it"" I should have viewed the two directors previous film work. Canadian filmmakers Jeremy Gillespie & Steven Kostanski have written decent indie horror films, but they have also been part of the art direction on terrible clunkers like the new Robocop, Poltergeist, Total Recall, and Pixels. This isn't to say the film was going to be lousy, but I would have been less disappointed and my anticipation wouldn't have been so high.The plot is convoluted but simplistic at the same time. There isn't a real underlying message or some brilliant story that's being told. A doctor losses his daughter and is looking for a way to resurrect her, how does he do this? Practice some Voodoo/Magic, insert a willing young girl to sacrifice herself to give birth to his daughter. Something happens to the doctor and he comes back looking like one of the cenobites from Hellraiser, his daughter is resurrected out of the young girls stomach and looks like something straight from The Thing. It's a complete mess and absolutely laughable. The rest is about a variety of people stuck inside a hospital and being attacked by this doctor and his deformed minions. Some of them transform into hideous beast after being attacked.Sure, this is a decent throwback to 80s horror and the visuals are semi-appealing, the gore is good, but that's about it. The story is all over the place and there isn't a real point to the film. There is no real reason to watch this film unless you haven't watched Hellraiser or The Thing. The film blatantly copies those two but does nothing to set itself apart from either. It was great to waste time too but it was all underwhelming."

Reading the good reviews will only give you high expectations and make the movie 10 times worse so spare yourself from both."

" Amateur wanna be horror

Garbage
" A film of two halves
",0.0,0.8584,2019-06-16 00:00:00,5,"This is a film which clearly had bold ambitions - going for an epic lovecraftian horror on a relatively low budget. What's sad for me is the film did show some signs of promise and found its groove in the latter stages, but it was spoilt by the frankly atrocious first half of the film.Let's start with the first half (so we can finish with the positives). It just felt too meaningless - all of the characters that were killed off were done so in such an off the cuff, spoof-like way it undermined the film's own intentions to disturb the viewer. And who were the white cloaked beings? Was there ever an explanation of those? Most of the main characters were not likeable (although perhaps in a stupid, comical way) and the actors for the best part weren't all that great either - but could maybe be sympathised with for a lot of the dialogue they were given! The two I thought pulled off their characters pretty well were the doctor and Alison.The second half was more interesting and suspenseful. It slowed down the pace more, gave you more insight into character motivations - and the character/monster terror mix was also done better. The monsters were pretty awesome - and the film is clearly inspired by 'The Thing' and 'Hellraiser' as I could see elements of those throughout. Certainly enjoyed 'the triangle portal' scenes towards the end of the film and that at least gave it a feel of spectacle, though sadly couldn't paper over the cracks of the very poorly executed first half."
" Absolutely amazing
",0.624,-0.7351,2019-06-14 00:00:00,9,"The effects are wonderfull, the timing is perfect. This movie always gives you enought time to feel confortable only to shock you with it's unseteling and disturbing horror effects and atmosphere.
The reason it's not a 10 is the last act wich....is ok but weak in comparassion to the rest."
" Saved by its special effects
",0.6705,0.5399,2019-05-21 00:00:00,7,"It's fair to say that I'm a sucker for what's known in the film industry as 'practical effects' when it comes to my horror films. Give me some stretched latex with pints of red liquid squirting out of a hole in some poor unfortunate's face over a digitally-rendered alien landscape filled with armies of marauding monster-soldiers. In other words... I consider 'The Void' to be 'old school' in terms of its approach to horror.An injured man is escorted to a hospital by the local police department one lonely night. From there everything goes to hell (in more ways than one!) and what follows is a kind of inter-dimensional siege movie where the hospital's occupants fight for survival against various other-worldly foes.I certainly enjoyed it and it's worth a second watch. However, I'm certainly not saying that it's perfect. In face, there are times when it's a complete mess. I say I'd re-watch it and that's totally down to the 'weirdness factor' about it. The film-makers really do throw everything they have into the film and do their best, plus, along with the great monster effects, it's certainly a cut above your average horror B-movie.'The Void's' main problem is that it tries to do too many things at once and therefore comes across as a little 'unfocused.' The humans caught up in this awful nightmare of a situation don't just find themselves up against one enemy (or TYPE of enemy) - they have at least three different threats working to chop them up for lunch. All three antagonists could have been the one and only villain, but trying to squeeze in reason and backstory behind them all really does crowd the proceedings.Plus it is one of those sorts of films that relies a bit on your own interpretation as to what's happening and the conclusions you take away. Don't expect to have everything spoon-fed to you and everything ultimately wrapped-up in a nice, neat little bow when the credits roll. Maybe the producers were hoping for a sequel? I don't know.As far as the performances go, they're okay. Most characters are there to be devoured horribly, so you're hardly going to get to know many of them. The primary character is the local sheriff and a guy who looks like internet 'news' frontman, Alex Jones! They get the most screen time and Kenneth Welsh (who I haven't seen since season 2 of 'Twin Peaks' is pretty reasonable as the crazy surgeon. Otherwise, you won't be remembering many of the names attached to this project.Ultimately, 'The Void' is very much a horror film. If you like your scares rubbery and nicely non-CGI then you could do worse than watching this. There are some genuinely creepy moments, but the story just needed a bit more direction to make it into the true 'cult classic' it should have been."
" The practical effects were pretty good...
",0.4939,0.9202,2019-05-15 00:00:00,5,"The work put into the effects was clearly a labor of love. And disgusting thought processes, but mostly love. Many, perhaps most, scenes were underlit and shot with narrow angles and focus, but that's certainly a function of working with a budget, so quite forgivable.The plot...eesh. One thing I wish all filmmakers would learn, at gunpoint if necessary, is that you simply cannot compensate for an incoherent plot just by saying ""ambiguity"" and leaving it at that. Too often, scripts are badly or hastily written, with little effort to resolve them into a clearer plot, because screenwriters rely on the ""ambiguity"" excuse as a loophole. So let's be clear -- intelligent ""ambiguity"" is as difficult to create as any carefully-explained plot. So when you say ""ambiguity"" and your ambiguity is neither intelligent nor provocative, it's entirely obvious to the audience that you simply failed to put in the hard work of writing good thought-provoking ambiguity.This film is a mess, plot- and character-wise. The unexpected ""twists"" come out of nowhere with neither justification nor reason to buy them. The vague Lovecraftian tropes seem to be thrown in there for the benefit of the effects people mentioned in my first paragraph, because they certainly had no explicable purpose here. The characters border on inane, with bizarre underreactions (when the state trooper was taken, for example, everyone acted as if they'd just seen a particularly puzzling t-shirt slogan, and Carter's bizarre deference to two armed rednecks invading the hospital gives one the impression that Carter wasn't actually a sheriff deputy, just wearing the uniform because he liked how he looked in it or something.) Drawing Allison into the ""void"" with Carter made no sense, or at least wasn't presented in a way that we have any reason to buy it. The doctor's motivations were beyond muddled. Either he's insane and every one of his followers are equally insane, or he's sane and completely manipulative, killing his followers to regain his daughter, which raises the question of why all these people would follow him and why an apparently normal girl would choose to have his child when it was pointedly clear that this was an extremely nasty situation...and neither make much sense with the scant evidence we're given. And so many more problems. It's just messy. The only bit of ambiguity I will allow as acceptable was the very last scene, with the pyramid and the Masonic iconography and such. That's a fair choice to leave obscure so the viewers can draw their own conclusions. The rest? Just plain lazy.At least Knives Chau lived. She was pretty much the main reason I watched. So good going there."

" Homage To Lovecraft!
",0.0,0.9372,2019-04-24 00:00:00,7,"I did not know what to expect when I pick this movie on Netflix. I assumed since it was so new that it was probably an indie flick and didn't expect much out of it. However what I got was a pulse pounding homage to one of my favorite writers of all time HP Lovecraft! Though not billed as a Lovecraft, he was present throughout the entire movie! I don't know how anyone could have written the script for this and not said that they got the idea completely from him! There are far too many similarities oh, I could sit here and almost write my senior thesis just on the similarities between this movie and Lovecraft!This movie was just up and down incredible, the cast was great for being an indie film, The Script was amazing I wish it had gone to a bigger budget studio with an even better cast because I think it could have been spectacular with a bigger budget. As it is it was reminiscent of the 80s Night Flyers, an amazing movie with a couple big stars it just never made it big because it didn't have the big Studio backing the big funding and the huge cast. The cinematography was okay but there were several times where the camera angle was severely lacking. There was a action going on and you could hear it but the camera angle didn't show it it was like the camera angle was trying to catch up with what was going on so I think that could definitely be improved upon. I love the fact that they didn't rely on CGI that everything was done without it actually gave this a more realistic believability! So there's your positive and negatives.Basically an officer of the Peace is about to finish his night and go back to the Sheriff's Office when in front of him he sees a man crawling along the road so he goes and picks him up and takes him to the nearest hospital because the man is injured. This hospital being mostly shut down due to a fire. When he gets there, he finds a grandfather and his pregnant granddaughter, an Asian woman who I'm guessing is a Cena because they said she was not a nurse but she was sent there to box up the files to go to the new hospital, his ex I don't know if she's a wife or not but they apparently had a child together that did not survive childbirth. An older doctor whose daughter had died, and then all of a sudden a father and son Rush In and try to attack the man that the sheriff has just brought in, so the sheriff has to handle them and get them separate, and as he's doing that all of a sudden out of nowhere a state police officer shows up. And there's a lot of holes in the story, we never learn what the father and son we're doing out at the drug house where the guy that the sheriff brought in was found but they pulled this guy in a woman out and they literally beat the woman and then set her on fire. They were trying to do the same to the guy but he got away and that's how they followed him to the hospital. Somehow it's all tied in to what's going on in the hospital, the guy says that the doctor was involved with what was going on in the drug house and I don't want to say too much and add spoilers but you never find out what the father and son had to do with it. And you never find out how the state police officer just happened to find out and get there so quickly! Without giving anything away I will just say that all of a sudden Madness and Mayhem erupts when you find out that outside the hospital is surrounded by people wearing white sheets and hats that look a lot like the KKK but they have a triangle in the face, they will not let anyone leave, and they are tied to experiments that a doctor is doing in the hospital! I think that this is a horror movie that is not for kids for sure, but I think it's a highly recommended horror movie. Very seldom do I give an indie movie over three stars, but this one was so good I had to give it 7!"
" Prometheus 2.0

Well because for some directors and writers is so hard to understand that you NEED a interesting cast in your horror movie! These people are so forgettable and bland that it hurts. The worst part is when they drop some random background to the characters, as if they wanted to show how deep these characters are!! But again, they fail to understand what a character needs: DEVELOPMENT AND PERSONALITY. Nah, here you got almost nothing. Some clichés and that's it.Forgettable and obnoxious as well are the sound design and the cinematography. You got next-level shaky cam (fortunately it's not so often), an AWFUL mixing of sound (you know, turning the music up to 10) and cliched flashed-lightning, as that crap scared people anymore! To be fair, I've seen worse, but this is mediocre at best.Acting and props are good, these are the only good things I can give the movie credit for. Well, maybe also some horror scenes were well directed.But oh boy if we dive into the plot. It's there where the movie sinks and drowns. I have to ask why. Why not sticking to a coherent script, maybe one not too complex or anything but well constructed (like the Thing, one of the movies this one tries to rip off) and work around it? But nooo man, we had to make a convoluted plot about a million things that don't add up and let the characters explaining it to the audience. You got everything: demons, skinless people, hooded guys... I got no idea how or why are they in the movie. To be honest, halfway through the movie I was no idea what the hell was going on. So the hooded guys are (people? demons?) in this cult and prevent the people in the hospital from getting out... except when the movie want them to leave. THEN they dissapear. Magically. I mean, they move faster than a DBZ character. What are they? Which logic do they follow?I got no idea. Then when the movie needs to they enter the hospital and proceed to kill'em all. I laughed when that happened. I ask, why didn't they enter early in the movie? They would've killed them all right away. But the funniest thing is that, at the end of the day, all they got is a knife and later on the movie, one of them ended up squashed like clay! No really, are demons so lame?Then you got the villain. He is the boss of a ""cult""? Religion? I don't know. It's established so quickly and developed so poorly that honestly I don't care. As far as I understand, he lost his daughter and he wants her back. Apparently he knows how: by being a god. Yeah that sounds stupid right? But don't worry, in the movie they make it even more stupid by not explaining HOW he plans to make it. You just got to assume that he can... somehow. He attaches demons to people I guess. Sounds silly right? Well be ready to rack your brain in order to figure it out because is so convoluted that it hurts!And if you wonder what this ""void"" is... let me tell you: some random flashbacks of a cloudy landscape that is supposed to be... heaven? hell? another dimension?That I don't freaking know. In the end the main characters are in the landscape next to a pyramid. What is that pyramid? HA! I wish I could answer that. I was watching Prometheus all over again!! They pull out a sci-fi setting out of nowhere to justify maybe the most important plot point of all!And that's the main problem of the movie. You can't take serious the horror elements because you're constantly trying to make sense out of the confusing plot. And that's what really hurts the movie. 4.5/10 for the effort, the acting and the props."

But the background noise was relatively loud and obnoxious, so there were some parts where the dialogue was drowned out no matter what the volume. Turning it up just made my ears hurt.Lighting: Most of the time it was fine, at least in the boring slow parts. But in the fight scenes suddenly there is no light, or random flashes of light combined with quick cuts and closeups of indeterminate body parts. Couldn't see anything that was happening.Camera work: Standard steady cam for the slow non-action scenes. As soon as the action starts, the camera starts to shake and jump like the camera is on a bungee cord. Random cuts and bad close-up work that tries to camouflage bad special effects and ends up hiding everything.The dialogue: Flat, cheesy, wooden. Half the time the actors sound like they are reading off a page and don't care. The other half of the time they sound like they are reading off a page while a dentist is pulling their teeth out with no anesthetic.The plot: What plot? Completely incoherent, random nonsense, with a couple of god-complex want-to-bring-the-dead-back-and-live-forever cliches thrown in to a blender and chopped up until even the oldest and most overused parts are almost unrecognizable in the alphabet soup they call a plot. The parts that are not cliche are just completely random story fragments whose only purpose seems to be so they can introduce a couple more warm bodies into the mix.The end: I kind of understood the end, even though it didn't really make any sense. Plus a little bit of arbitrary deus ex machina for some of the characters to escape certain doom. I guess it kind of almost deserves half a star for making some attempt, however lousy, to wrap it all up at the end."

Great thudding music that is meant to go with dread. Great eerie feeling of claustrophobia and being surrounded. Lots of the tropes without demon supernatural crap. Hilarious evolution of main character.

But the Lovecraftian concept depicted in The Void is so good that you will be more than tolerant of the mediocre acting that occurs at times throughout the film.
The film has some key scenes that conveys the point that horror is not always about the scares, those scenes show us that beyond eerie, creepy face of the horror genre. For me this film has been the equivalent of Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness, due to this aforementioned effect of it.Well done, well done in deed."
" Not So Great Beginning, A Better Ending
",-0.0893,-0.9988,2019-01-10 00:00:00,6,"9 July 2017. Can a not so great, chaotic movie be redeemed with a somewhat decent ending? While I can't say I'd recommend this movie to spend your time on, it surprisingly almost did the trick. But. A number of commenters associated this movie with John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) and Prince of Darkness (1987). While there are a few monster scenes in The Void that are derivative of the spreading monster in The Thing, The Void doesn't consistently use this monster theme as its primary threat which made The Thing so successful. And while the ominous tone and ambiance of Prince of Darkness are suggested in The Void, its storyline really doesn't carry that heavy cloud of dread because it has too much disjointed supposedly scary fright moments that actually take away from Carpenter's more quiet horror setting that permeates his entire movie. Many commenters also associated this movie with Lovecraft's handiwork, including From Beyond (1986). Like Carpenter's works, From Beyond uses a simple frightening straightforward storyline with a specific sense of dread or goal in mind, whether it's surviving a single monster who can be anything or anybody, or discovery of a singular strange glowing object in a tube, or the singular investigation into a mysterious machine that might open the door to the beyond. But The Void's overall storyline strays far afield from this singular theme and resorts to a series of supposedly horror events, sometimes seemingly unconnected, to maintain and impress its audience. Joe Cappelle's film adaptation of Dean Koontz's Phantoms (1998) is much more haunting and singularly creepy without resorting to a continuing distracting chaos.A few commenters allude to mind control which unfortunately was more implicit in this movie, with a nurse. Yet it falls quite short in taking advantage of this device to enhance the movie's sense of helplessness. Galaxy of Terror (1981) uses mind control as its basis for an ominous dread that drips throughout this movie. Even The Prince of Darkness had its share of mind control with effective success. From Beyond used mind control in a very seductive, alluring erotic way. Some commenters associate this movie with Hell Raiser (1987), yet since then, most of such riveting monsters the audience has seen before in one fashion or another, including Resident Evil: Extinction (2007). For those who have seen a lot of horror shows, such characters at some point become pretty ordinary except as in the case Joss Whedon's script that was thrust magnificently onto the big screen in Cabin in the Woods (2012).There are plenty of commenters who connect this movie with Silent Hill (2006), a mother's search for her daughter. It is this very intimate and strong faithful connection between mother and daughter that that devotion that made Silent Hill so resonate in its appeal and connection to the audience. Unfortunately, what The Void offers it audience is a father-son relationship that begins with them murdering a woman and attempting to kill an unknown man fleeing the scene, not a very sympathetic beginning or attachment appealing experience towards these men. This scene makes them look like the evil incarnate themselves. The movie has a relatively weak deputy who really is inconsistently played by Aaron Poole who is not a very appealing character either. The deputy has no wits to acquiring a sheriff's gun when he could to defend himself, later he stays behind when a group of men go searching the hospital building and briefly wanders off by himself while searching the bowels of the building and then suddenly reappears. Then one moment he indicates they need to go back and the next he's going to go down some stairs further into the building.The use of mysterious clouds is better used in Solaris (1972, 2002). There is a lot of use of darkness and strobelights for the chopping and slashing scene as in Alien (1979). But in The Void the overly alien blob is allowed to be too visible initially. There is no emotional build up, just a collision of attacks on multiple fronts resulting in brain freeze. Then there's the mysterious move of a patrol car which appears to be ""just"" a script ploy where audience knows what's likely to happen there. Another character suddenly comes off as an anxiety ridden control freak which is a problem in of itself. The early scenes are somewhat like watching several domestic violence scenes without being able to do anything about it. It's just well sickeningly screwed. Then there's a rather seemingly sudden personality change to a rather tolerable gruff man who gives up a rifle for an axe? There are some unexplained weird behavior beyond mind control and poor editing that jumps horror scenes from place to place in a rather disjointed fashion as if the director thought it would add to the frantic horror tone, but only succeeds in making the film jumpy and more frustratingly incoherent.What The Void does seem to offer at least is a last third of the movie where it becomes more focused, with a pulsing, directive energy and pursuit of a lost love becoming more tangible and straightforward. Most of the rest of the movie becomes somewhat decent by the end by horror movie standards and perhaps many of the glowing commenters' comments might apply here. Besides Ellen Wong's singular performance, the rest of the actors aren't given that much to play with compared to the other movies already mentioned. By the end of the movie, one might at least arrive at the conclusion that it wasn't a complete waste and some good may have appeared to come of it. A better monster alien will found in Alien: Resurrection (1997) though not everybody enjoyed. There's the lusciously photographed, surrealistic, mind-bending Jennifer Lopez's The Cell (2000). A much creepier movie is Scarlett Johannsen's Under the Skin (2013). And among the best ""in search of"" horror shows is Cuba Gooding Jr's The Devil's Tomb (2009)."

",0.3382,0.8878,2018-12-24 00:00:00,2,"REVIEW - THE VOIDAs an independent impartial reviewer I'm not associated with and studio or publication so I feel I can give a truly unbiased view of the films I watch.Recently there has been a deluge of horror films and like most genre some are great like A Quiet Place and some are quite literally laughable like Hereditary and I'm afraid to say The Void definitely falls into the latter, in fact I will go further to say that this offering, especially after reading some of the recommendations was actually a complete waste of my time, time which could have been better spent watching paint dry..
Basically a cop delivers a patient to a hospital which is closing and things start to happen.No real plot direction, no concept of horror and definitely no idea of even suspense the birth was confusing with the sudden appearance of the same monster that made an appearance earlier from the eyes of another patient, no avoid this like you would Sausage Party, definitely one to miss!Rating 2 out of 10"
" It has great practical effects.... I think... But that's about all it has.
",0.3716,-0.9869,2018-12-20 00:00:00,4,"I love films with Lovecraftian themes, and I love some good body horror. I love practical effects too. But overall... This movie left me cold.This is a kind of standard setup. Agroup of nondescript people find themselves trapped in a nondescript hospital where it turns out horrific bodyhorror transformationd are breaking out. It's just a shame that the filmmakers never really do anything with what they have in terms of story and plot. And while it's refreshing to see practical gore it would also have been great to do something interesting with the effort.I understand the thinking behind most of the decisions. But the characters are frustratingly one note. The worst offender being the asian medical student who can't do... Well... Anything. Except scream and cry for help. But the others aren't that much better. And I know there is a tight line to balance on when it comes to how much of the creatures to show, too much and we loose mystery but too little and we likewise aren't even intrigued to know more. I also understand the desire to not waste time but the result felt so damned rushed.The worst thing is that in the absence of me being invested I just couldn't help thinking of similar scenarios done better. From Robert Rodriguez doing Planet Terror to countless shlockly japanese gorefests. Set in hospitals with Lovecraftian undertones and filled with body horror.It really didnt help that the soundmix was extremely muddled, but I suspect that that was a poor streaming conversion to 2.0 from an original 5.1 by the distributor.In all it felt like a needlessly halfbaked story that I've seen done way better. Barely watchable in places with characters that had no personality or charm.Ifgore is all you want or need, then yes, it has a lot of that. But frankly. You deserve more than simple viscera."
" Strange horror movie will please some ......
",-0.4939,0.8322,2018-11-11 00:00:00,7,"Void is an oddity. I'd best describe it as somewhere between Hellraiser and The Thing, but without the commanding theme of the former, and without the far better special effects of the latter. I'm reminded of the movie The Mist, and perhaps Alien as well. The effects are, well, kind of slapdash, with a lot of slosh and gore, but to my mind rather badly cobbled together, although this situation improves toward the end, and, gratefully, the movie at least delivers a very cinematic close. The acting and script are good, and there are aspects to the horror that certainly have potential, such as the mysterious figures that arrive at various junctures to shepherd the action. And there are various miens to the plot and characters that also have potential, such as characters that morph from bad to good and visa versa, and the different reactions from various unusual players that was also pretty original. The idea for the film is overall sound, but for me its execution (certainly by the mid-point) was just too confused to work properly. The film never seemed to have the time to concentrate on the tension before someone gets it, so to speak. I thought it lost shock potential here and there. It's certainly worth a look, and an important selection for anyone into collecting monster movies. A very hard movie to review. There's a lot going on, but it is definitely a very bloody horror movie, and it will entertain."

",-0.6416,-0.3389,2018-11-04 00:00:00,6,"When you put together a movie on a budget, even a much larger budget than this one has, you have to think of it as a balloon. You want the effects to hold up. You want your actors to do more than just drool. You want the movie to hold together without any obvious weaknesses.
This appears to be a well cast, well acted, well produced bit of horror for a Halloween audience done on a budget, but done in a balanced way. It looks spare rather than cheap. Spare is good. Maximum use is made of power failure, blinking lights, lonely road situations, simple but memorable symbols, such as the triangle. Well Done. Maintains many standard creep style tropes but so what, that's what most horror shows do. The weakness for me was with the script, and it was more that the plot lacked the spare originality of the other parts of the movie. It is worth a creep show date night watch. But you won't be buying the DVD for a second showing. I would say that everyone associated with the movie is worth watching for the chops they showed in this get-together, and hopefully more to come."

If you've seen enough horror movies, you start realizing that the tropes are always the same, you always anticipate the ""scary"" moments and you always get the same old cheap scare tactics. Either flashing lights + screaming, or something, that is supposed to look scary or nasty. 
Well, this movie surprised me really nicely. All I can say is, that it starts strong the foot stays on the pedal all throughout the movie. It is suspenseful and it fills you with dread the way only a Lovecraftian story can. (I'm not saying that the movie is based on the Lovecraft novels, but you definitely get that feeling from it.) 
In a genre that has become full of repetitive disappointing content, you should really give this movie a try."

cheap CGI jumpscares actually I don't think I noticed even one jumpscare. Nice to see something different.The actors were fine in my opinion, I liked the characters (at least in the first half of the movie).
What sucks is the Story and it really sucks, it makes no sense, it was confusing and I, at some point after the first half, didn't care anymore.
Nothing was explained about what's happening through the whole movie but suddenly everyone's acting like I'm supposed to know all the backstories of the characters and how the all weird stuff is working.

I fall almost in between, liking this film more than disliking it, but at the same time it disappointed me as it is yet another horror film that had such potential and did some things so good, but in the end was undermined by a poorly thought out script that took the plot into places that just were not as good as where my mind was thinking it would go. Still, it had a very good atmosphere, good gore effects and the cast was pretty good...it is the shame they felt the need to explain too much and in such a disappointing way as well. The story has two guys killing a girl and setting her on fire and another man they are after getting away. This guy is found by a police officer who takes the guy to a hospital where strange things begin to happen including the place being surrounded by hooded figures with a triangle symbol on the hood. They are quite deadly, but so too, are the people inside as a nurse transforms into a hideous monstrosity! The officer has to figure out what is going on as the head of the hospital who is seemingly killed comes back to taunt the officer and take his wife into the strange depths of the hospital where the bodies of those he has experimented on reside and still live on! It had so much potential, but the script seems to have revolved around the writing of the gore and building a story around it and that story was full of more holes than your typical slice of Swiss cheese! What exactly happened that made the two guys who were on the trail of the one guy go on their rampage? It is never really explained, only that it cost their families and a wound to the younger guy that caused him to be unable to speak. The cult is never fully explained, I did not like how the doctor ended up being in control of everything, I was hoping for a more vague malevolent force instead. Why did the squad car get moved? It seemed kind of pointless unless they were going to ambush them in a much more direct way than appearing in the forest and then one guy attacks. Why did the one nurse go crazy in the first place? Why did the doctor make her go berserk if that is what happened? This is where a more vague force would have worked better tied to the one guy found on the road. Just more stuff like this that just did not work as far as plot. The movie did have a great atmosphere, good visuals and the use of practical special effects was refreshing. I am not in the totally anti computer graphics camp; however, leave it to the big budget movies as they can make it look real and seamless, low budget films they look cheap and ruin the film. This is especially true of blood effects, I do hate computer generated blood with a passion. This one used practical effects and I applaud them for that. I just wish they put as much effort and energy into the script as they did with the effects in this one."

This film is all build up, dropped hints, and dangled carrots. The problem is that it never gets around to just being a damn movie.The premise, which I don't think I could explain if I tried, is clearly overly ambitious for the filmmakers to pull off. It's part ""Hellraiser,"" part ""Re-Animator,"" part ""Event Horizon,"" part, I don't know, ""Halloween II?"" There are people trapped in a hospital, Klu Klux Klan members lurking outside, a devil worshiping doctor, mutant zombie corpses, a woman giving birth, a useless nurse, a Libertarian. Everyone shouts a lot and for a long time the hostages are their own worst problem. Then they go exploring the murky depths of the hospital and boy, does the exposition begin. But the exposition never makes any sense, and to this day I'm still totally in the dark about who all the hooded figures walking around were.I like my horror cerebral if it's done well, but if it's not, then I'd prefer something dumber but actually scary.Grade: C-"

It kicks off a disturbing scenario from the first minute and plummets straight into nightmarish soon enough. I haven't seen this kind of enjoyable and well made practical effects since the 80's The Thing, or perhaps as late as Species. 
No glaring and cheesy CGI is to be seen. What there is of CGI budget is all splurged on gorgeous otherwordly scenes. The main set has the lovely dichotomy you would find in a classy Silent Hill hospital, with juicy decorations from Clive Barker's Hellraiser.

The Thing and The Fly had better effects and this was made in 2016?! i guess they were trying to go for some sort of shock effect with how edgy and gory and shocking their 'creatures' were.

This movie overall feels a little bit amateurish, but in a a good way, the way that means they are more likely to take risks, rather than follow what a studio would like, to get a ""horror lite"" product. The story isnt bad and visuals of the bad guys in cloaks are excellent. The setting is a virtually abandoned hospital. I have to say that with the evil doctor and all, it felt at times like Hellraiser 2 (my fave in that series for dark feels). The monsters were great, creepy and fairly uncompromising, as well as the results of the medical experiments tucked away in the spooky basement. The sotry was very well paced without too many cliches. The evil doctor had a good motivation for being that way, with the inclusion of occult worshipping into the movie. I was very impressed with this and the last scene is fairly spectacular. Well done to the makers of this film for making something quite groovy in horror."

" Totally not a school project
",0.0,0.9692,2018-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Product review  The void is an horror movie that I had discovered through a H.P Lovecraft group page back in november. The person who was talking about it described it as a great lovecraftian film so I was interested. The void is a great horror film that the horror genre was missing in my opinion it has a lovecraft vibe from it, it also has a very interesting story and visuals that keeps the viewer interested in the movie. 
 This movie delivers many strengths from the prosthetics, the scenery ,the story, and the feel of the whole movie. The prosthetics are amazing it gives the movie a classic horror movie vibe. The void creatures in the movie look amazing and the effort that was put in to make these creatures and effects is unbelievable. The first look at these creatures is truly terrifying and the creatures become more and more interesting to look at as the movie progresses. Another big thing that makes this movie great is the scenery and feel. Every scene in this movie things get crazier and crazier especially with the basement scene where they encounter more void creatures, The feeling of this scene is suspenseful and creepy. I would go into more details but I don't want to spoil as much of the movie as I can. 
 The only things I had a problem with is if they went more in depth with the cult and explained what they did in detail to james and what he went through that led to the void. I don't have any problems with this movie other than going a little more into detail. I get it adds to the suspense and mystery but a little more.
 Overall this is one of my favourite movies and I highly recommend it to anyone. If anyone asks for a good horror movie or a good movie I always recommend this. This movie never gets boring for me i've watched it 7 or 6 times now. I give this movie A ++, this movie is also worth purchasing because you can watch it a couple hundred times and it would never gets old."
" I don't care what reservations you have about contemporary horror, you need to see this
",-0.7452,0.9903,2018-03-24 00:00:00,10,"I caught The Void on Netflix, and if you've attempted to watch any of the independent horror films on there, you know that the vast majority are slow, meandering, and a general waste of time. The Void succeeds where these films fail. It doesn't have a long drawn out prologue. It isn't an ugly, desaturated borefest. It doesn't have mopey annoying characters that are a pain to follow. It successfully avoids all the trappings of the modern genre to bring us a film that is a real gem. One of The Void's biggest strengths is the pacing. Aside from a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout for character development, the film throws you into the action and doesn't let up until the finale. It also continually ramps up the stakes, constantly creating new and refreshing scenarios and set pieces. The characters and acting are all very good as well. There's no unjustified assholes or characters that exist solely to be annoying. Everyone feels like a real person being thrown into this situation, so while you don't get a lot of backstory or character development you immediately understand where everyone is coming from and are easily able to relate and empathize with all of them. The practical special-effects are a big selling point with this film. I don't want to give away all the fun, so I'll merely say that they are ambitious and flawlessly executed. I know there is CGI used to touch up some things, remove wires and puppeteers, etc, but when something horrific is happening on screen it's also happening right in front of the actors. That adds so much to the believability and immersion of the film. The filmmakers primary background is in makeup and special effects, working on everything from IT (2017), Crimson Peak, The Shape of Water, and the Hannibal tv series, and they really utilize their full skill set with this film.Because of it's rural setting, isolated location, and lack of cell phones and computers, the film effectively creates a timeless quality, but is likely meant to be a period piece, taking place in the late 1980s. The film draws a great deal of inspiration from the films of that era. Certain moments seem very much like a slasher film while others delve into the pseudo-Lovecraftian cosmic horror of movies like Hellraiser and the Thing. While some of these inspirations are very obvious and transparent they're done very lovingly and always provide a fresh spin on what's being presented. In short, The Void is a great flick. If you're a horror fan, it's a must see, and even if you're not the biggest horror hound, it is an artfully constructed, extremely engaging movie that is still well worth your time."

Is it horror? Yes, Its a horrible film because it tries to be something its not. Is it science fiction? Yes, its scientifically a bad movie!The dialogue (script) is a mess------lots of superfluous use of yelling and the ""F"" word, to no practical benefit. There is gore, but that does not sustain a movie.This movie seems to have been made not for the enjoyment of the movie viewers, but to satisfy the movie makers desires to be seen as in the same company as ""iconic"" horror storytellers from the past------storytellers who are no longer relevant to consumer tastes.I won't name these former icons of horror filmmaking because that is what the makers of ""The Void"" want in comparison of their effort.The Void is aptly titled because their are several voids in the plot. Any reasonable viewer is left wondering, ""What the hell is that included for"", or ""What just happened?'There is absolutely no redeeming quality to this film. Given that, examine the hyperbole and scores used by the paid reviewers and production crew ro celebrate this movie. You will see the corruption that IMDb has fostered.Its alarming that IMDb has allowed paid reviewers or people affiliated with the production to hijack the reviews to promote this movie among others.

It's a loving throwback to horror classics with modern polish, clearly influenced by HP Lovecraft and body horror classics like Hellraiser and The Thing. If you like ""classic"" horror - i.e., horror before CGI and jump scares replaced practical effects and slow dread - you owe it to yourself to watch this movie.It does drag a little bit at the end, but the opening and middle are fantastic. I would have given this movie a 10/10 if the denouement had been done more efficiently. But honestly, it's very watchable right up to the credits.This movie has some of the best damn body horror I have EVER seen, period. I don't know how much of it was accomplished by practical effects, but it does seem like a lot. The acting is mostly good, and the pacing, while slower than most modern horror movies, is brisk enough that I didn't get bored. I really wish horror movies like this were still getting made."
" A breath of fresh air in the ""Body Horror"" genre
",-0.34,0.9909,2018-02-14 00:00:00,8,"If you're reading this and haven't seen this movie yet, stop reading now and watch it before you go any further.---------------------------
The movie starts off with a very effective cold opening that immediately hooks you and makes you want to learn just what the hell is going on. Then, for the next 20 minutes or so, it feels like it's going to be a generic thriller/slasher of some sort, but nothing could be further from the truth and at about the 25 minute mark all hell breaks lose. Right as it looks like the cult leader is going to dispatch the protagonist, they are both catapulted into the realm of ""the void"" in which we see the cop and his ex-wife come face-to-face with the massive pyramid from the visions that have been alluded to in earlier visions/premonitions while the doctor seemingly vanishes and we are left to ponder his fate and the fates of the lead characters; what happens next is left up to our own imaginations. This movie is a fantastic love letter to the practical effect stylings of John Carpenter, David Cronenberg and Clive Barker mixed with H.P. Lovecraft folklore. While the movie is riveting all the way through, as the credits roll, you come to the realization that multiple viewings are going to be mandatory. It's just not possible to comprehend everything that you see after your first watch (hence the Lovecraftian aspect).While this is not a cinematic masterpiece, it is extremely effective by being purposely ambiguous (especially the ending). The viewer is treated as one of the inhabitants of the world that is being portrayed on screen which serves as an impetus to help make a connection with the movie's characters.
Upon watching/reading reviews for this movie it's surprising how many people complain about this. It's saddening that the majority of audiences and critics have been conditioned to need to be spoon fed the backstories of every character and need absolute resolution at the end of every movie so everything gets tied up in a nice, neat bow. Ambiguity isn't a bad thing, quite the opposite! I believe the filmmakers were purposely ambiguous and understand that everyone fears, if you realize it or not, the ""unknown"" which is the one characteristic that is innate to humans and distinguishes us from every other animal on the planet. Our brains are hardwired to recognize patterns in order for us to be able to make sense of the world around us. When that mechanic is subverted we naturally get uncomfortable and uneasy because we can't make sense of what is happening.Another gripe that people are raising is that the whole movie is a series of highly unlikely coincidences that need to be played out exactly how they are in order for the movie to work i.e. the cop having to go to the one hospital where his ex works which is the same place where the doctor/cult leader conducts his ritualistic machinations.At the end of the day, all movies are naturally divisive in nature no matter what the genre. The best ones are thought provoking and stimulate debates/conversations well after they have been seen and this is one of the best examples of that. Everyone is going to have their own interpretations and thoughts about what the movie was actually about and that's ok; that's what great entertainment should do."
" Solid
",0.1531,-0.5372,2018-02-12 00:00:00,7,"The first time I watched the void I walked away from it disappointed and I honestly didn't like it at all. Then I gave it a second chance. During and after that second viewing, I realized that when I first saw it I probably wasn't in the mood for gore, and that it's actually a darn good movie. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely cool, and it'll please most horror fans. Especially after seeing it a second time, I couldn't help but notice the Lovecraftian aspects of ""The Void"". The entire concept of a sane man in an insane world is spot-on with the Lovecraft style, and it's a theme I love. There's a great cast of characters here that'd also be at home in a Lovecraft novel; the star protagonist who feels he's in a dream, and a mix of others who're as lost as he is, and those who know more about the situation but aren't telling, simply because they're too frightened.However, it's within this concept that I feel ""The Void"" didn't quite achieve true greatness. The focus of the story shifts around so much that it's hard to stay frightened. Instead of feeling fear from one perspective (the main character), you're hit with moments of fright here and there, and that's where it falls short. Had the story focused solely on what Officer Carter (Aaron Poole) experiences from start to finish-without taking you out of his emotional perspective-then that Lovecraftian theme of ""sane man dropped into an insane world"" would've been even more frightening. Additionally, if Dr. Powell was properly introduced to us more deliberately, his role later in the film possibly would've been filled with more fright on top of the gore. There were just a few times when I felt like I was watching a Resident Evil film-if only for a moment or two. Those moments during the scary parts of a movie are so precious, and I felt it losing me at some of those points. Still, with all of that said, I feel I'm reflecting on what I saw here more than reviewing. To get back to the point; ""The Void"" is a very solid horror movie that will strike a pleasantly dark and gory chord with most horror fans. There's a great cast of mostly unknown actors and actresses who all do a very good job in their respective roles. Story, acting, setting, cinematography and camerawork-all are executed with a very confident and strong style. ""The Void"" plays-out a lot like a Stephen King movie. If any of this sounds like your bag, then give a chance."
" Some nice practical effects but little else ...
",0.2263,-0.762,2018-02-12 00:00:00,3,"THE VOID is heavy on practical special effects but lacks a strong core with which to build its story around. There is so much going on in the film, and yet it simultaneously feels empty. It plays like a random set of events without a logical centre to hold it all together. Even cerebral horror (which this isn't) needs a clear and cohesive core from which to operate. The big problem is that the film is so derivative. I notice a lot of reviewers mentioning John Carpenter's THE THING, which is rather insulting to John Carpenter. Perhaps this says more about reviewers who have seen anywhere near enough films to be able to write a meaningful review, or who spend too much time watching just one type of film to really get a good grasp of what cinema can do. If anything, THE VOID is much more closely related to something like SPOOKIES (1986) or, JACK BROOKS: MONSTER SLAYER (2007), the ""Pro-Life"" episode of MASTERS OF HORROR than anything Carpenterian. Yes, there's a lot of Clive Barker going on and overdoses of Lovecraftian imagery, which Carpenter likewise employs both in THE THING, PRINCE OF DARKNESS and IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, but THE VOID has more in common with Stewart Gordon and Brian Yuzna's versions of Lovecraft.As well as the aforementioned films, there are clearly nods to HELLRAISER, REANIMATOR, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and PHANTASM. THERE'S EVEN SOME CYBER PUNK THROWN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE. It's just a shame all this doesn't add up to a satisfying movie experience."

" A fitting title
",0.0,0.8778,2018-01-16 00:00:00,5,"(Spoilers ahead) I usually don't watch trailers because they give out the plot so much, but somehow ended up seeing one for ""The Void"". It looked interesting enough and I felt that, for once, I wouldn't get what was going to happen beforehand - I had high hopes about this one. Well, I was disappointed by how of a missed opportunity it turned out to be.There are people stuck in a hospital during the night-shift, pretty much in the middle of nowhere. There's a cult thing going on and creatures right out of a Carpenter meets Clive Barker's story (sadly, without the genius) ... And that's about it. It's hard to say more without literally giving away the whole film - there's just so little happening. It's basically the characters trying to comprehend what is going on around them without ever being too surprised about it.(+)
The theme; it varies from all the found footage + moving into a new (haunted) house pattern we perpetually get in Horror these days. Nice throwback to the 80's/90's.No jump scares but way too loud music during 'scary' scenes, which doesn't let you decide whether you should feel tense or not, it's pretty much thrown at your face and asking you to be.It's nice to see some practical effects. I did like most of the creatures and the scenes involving them were the only decent ones - they could have been lengthier.(-)
The lukewarm acting. The majority of the cast looked like they didn't believe a single thing they were saying, especially Aaron Poole, who sadly happens to be the lead. Nurse Kim, played by Ellen Wong, was the only one who managed to convey a tiny bit of dread in the middle of this bland fest. There was no tension at all and it was hard focusing on the movie all along, I just couldn't feel any sympathy nor empathy for the characters.There were too many stories within the story, with none of them particularly connected (or at least, the connections failed to be clear). As much as I like a movie that leaves you with a bit of questioning when the credit rolls, the unexplained parts felt like plot holes here. What is really that cult about ? There's the triangle/pyramid imagery but then so what ? What about the Doctor ? What about the cop and his ex-wife at the end ? What about the opening scene altogether ? There's too many ""what actually happened ?"" to be satisfied with ""The Void""."
" An unashamed John Carpenter tribute
",0.0,-0.8026,2018-01-16 00:00:00,7,"While I don't like open rip-offs and remakes of previous, better fare, I have no problems with watching films that are heavily derived from their predecessors. The low budget, crowd-funded Canadian indie horror flick THE VOID is such a film, a throwback to 1980s creature cinema which feels heavily indebted to the movies of John Carpenter. It's a siege film in which a bunch of characters holed up in an isolated hospital are assailed by hooded cult members and horrific monsters, and the viewer witnesses bits of the HELLRAISER series as well as PRINCE OF DARKNESS and THE THING as they watch. I'm a huge fan of anything remotely Lovecraftian, and the tentacled horror of THE VOID was right up my street. Sure, the budget is low and they have to cut corners at times, leaving some parts fairly unconvincing, but the prosthetic effects are quite terrifying and the gore scenes hard to stomach. The unknown cast work hard to convince in their roles, and there's enough energy and imagination to make this a lot of fun."

Pros:
I love occult, cthulhu mythos, etc. so I loved the movies themessome of the best practical effects I have seen in a long time, creature design and make-up design is also nicethrowback feeleasy to pick up (honestly thats because the story is quite cliché, but whatever)Cons:
boring characters + dialogue, not bad acting, but none of the characters made me care about them (apart from Kim, a nurse who seems to be the only normal yet interesting)terrible story: we´re talking plotholes, predictable, cliché and overall messy story-telling. the plot is so simple, yet it has no red lining its just people doing stuff, almost as if their only purpose is to encounter disgusting creatures (gross in a good way)no build-up whatsoever, this movie goes real fast! that might sound good, but its actually a terrible decision. without the build-up I honestly dont care if any of these characters die, I dont even know them yet, thus the tension got thrown overboard before it could even beginOverall Id say this movie is poorly done, but if youre looking for a monster movie or simply want a modern movie with great practical effects, this is a good pick!"

Seriously, this film feels like a spiritual cousin to Prince of Darkness by way of Halloween 2, with an army of cultists surrounding an understaffed hospital which becomes a gateway to another dimension.A drug fiend flees a farmhouse, followed by a woman who is shot and killed by Vincent and his son, Simon. The running man is found crawling away and brought to a hospital by Deputy Carter, who is worried about running into his ex-wife Allison, who works there as a nurse.They aren't there for long before another nurse tears her face off and kills a patient, only to be shot dead by Carter, who collapses and has visions. He is told by state trooper Mitchell to leave the scene, but once he walks to his patrol car, he's attacked by robed cultists who have surrounded the building.Meanwhile, Beverly's dead body has transformed into a tentacled otherworldly beast straight out of Carpenter's The Thing. Just then, the father and so from the beginning arrive and a standoff occurs - they want to kill James. At the last moment, Beverly's monstrous form kills the state policeman before being killed.One of the patients is pregnant, so some of the staff go to find supplies while the attending physician, Dr. Powell, reveals that he is the leader of the cult. He begins tormenting Daniel, telling him that he knows all about the visions that he had while unconscious.Powell appears to Allison and explains how he has learned to defy death after losing his daughter, then he removes his face. He then claims that she has something growing inside of her. Meanwhile, deformed corpses in the basement come to life and attack.As the patient is about to give birth, she reveals that she was carrying Dr. Powell's child. And Allison also gives birth to a tentacles creature that is still inside her body, killing her. Daniel attacks her remains with an axe, then walks into a room with a glowing triangle on the wall. There, Powell claims he can give him his child back (he and Allison had lost a baby, which led to their separation) if he dies first.The pregnant woman reappears and stabs Daniel and kneels before a skinless Powell, who recites a ritual that causes her to explode and be reborn as his daughter. The father and son return to save the day, setting everything on fire, but Powell has begun his ascension and is asking Daniel to join him. Simon, the son, escapes with Kim, one of the nurses while Daniel tackles the doctor and sends them back into the void.As the movie closes, we see Daniel and Allison holding hands, somewhere in a netherworld - an ending that is very similar to Fulci's The Beyond.The Void is the first modern horror film to excite me in some time. I've been disappointed by overhyped projects in the past, so I was pleased to discover that this film has its practical effects heart in the bloodiest of places. Several have complained that the film makes no sense, but I see it as the spiritual successor to absolute films such as Inferno and the aforementioned The Beyond and The Prince of Darkness. And it's robed cultists, who silently wait for the command to kill, are the most artistically arresting horror villains in decades."

The characters were weakly written, and the story was just confusing and incoherent, although I love complicated plots, but this one didn't really work for me. It's really slow that I cared for none of the characters and who will survive. The only good parts are the practical effects, lighting and art direction which were pretty good. I'd give it a 6 out of 10."
" Enjoyable if slightly flawed effort
",0.4404,-0.8069,2017-12-19 00:00:00,9,"Arriving at a desolate hospital, the on-duty staff left finds their new charge trying to escape from a horde of cultists trying to keep them contained within the building in order to prepare for a demonic charge to enter our world and forces them to work together to get out alive.This one ended up being quite a fun and enjoyable effort. One of the strongest elements of this one is the rather dark and chilling idea at the core of the film. The film plays incredibly well on the idea of the otherworldly terror creeping into the remote hospital as the escalation of events from the first half gradually start to point to something creepy happening. Those early scenes, from the encounters at the lodge to the arrival at the hospital and the possessed nurse coming to take out the other residents before turning into the start of the weirdness with the deformed monstrosity that erupts and takes out the few members of the group out in the hallways of the hospital. Once it brings in the second group that arrives to hold them inside the building, the frenetic action turns into a solid, chilling story about the building itself and the history of those involved which really gives this a freaky, charged bent that really scores well here. From the underground drug and prostitution ring to the satanic cult with their sacrifices gives this one quite a fine backstory to allow it to start playing around with it's setting. The hospital itself is a fantastically-realized setting with the long, darkened hallways going off endlessly into the distance, the way it plays with the concept of space and time by moving architecture around to odd places or even magically transporting elements into their surroundings which should not be there with the inclusion of the zombies in the basement or the creatures coming to take them into the realms of the other dimensions which turns the final half into a gruesome and utterly dark finale with the rampaging creature deep in the bowels of the hospital. With all the different practical effects for the gore as well as the creatures popping up here, these manage to hold this one up over it's few minor flaws. The main issue here is the fact that it plays way too familiar way too often here, as not only are scenes ripped off wholesale from other films the way it all comes together at times makes it feel as if it's all been done before in other features which strike this as being somewhat problematic. The fact that the pace dies off in order to get the backstory going is another issue, but not nearly as detrimental as the other issue.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and heavy violence against infants."

",-0.5106,-0.6903,2017-11-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie was a aesthetically pleasing stand apart from most modern horror films. The scenery, colors, and tone was just fantastic to watch. It felt like a lovingly made homage to John Carpenter, Clive Barker, and 80's horror. The fantastic practical effects which this screams The Thing. I can see how some don't care for it with the vagueness of the plot and the ending, but it fits with the genre. Cosmic horror is such a genre to find any good contributions to, and this was certainly good pickings with creeping horror and the unfathomable unknown There were instances where a scene was set up like they were going to take the route of a cheap jump scare, My only real gripes with the movie was the dialogue at the start felt a little clunky/exposition heavy especially with the Doctors first conversation with Daniel was a blatant exposition dump, but as the movie continues the dialogue and reactions felt much more natural. Then then the editing with the scene flashing lamp was a little hard to look at, and if it had been cut just a bit different could of been much more effective, and not the fear of having an epileptic fit from the flashing that made it a pain to look at. Otherwise the tone and tension that builds is good. There were so many opportunities for cheap jump scares, in the various scenes felt like a set up for them, but there was no jump which kept the tension strong. The score was low and tense keeping me on the edge of my seat. Over all I'd highly recommend to any fans of 80's horror and Cosmic horror."

This isn't ""The Next Modern (insert good film here)"". It's just a really lazy rehash of better movies with none of the soul and passion behind it.Everything about this film is shallow, uninspired, and tired. The characters are boring and uninteresting, the plot is vague and unoriginal, and the monster designs are forgettable. Yes, there are practical monster effects in this film, but the designs themselves are underwhelming and unoriginal. Side plots are left by the wayside, so don't expect any of your questions to be answered. Plot Time! This movie takes place in a mostly abandoned hospital. There are some cult guys out on the hospital lawn wearing spooky bed sheets. They just kind of stand outside. One of them has a knife and stabs somebody, but that's it. I guess everybody else forgot to bring their knives that day. Oh but don't worry. If cults and monsters aren't scary enough for you, there's plenty of people drama! Mr.CopProtagonist likes to fight a lot with ViolentForNoReasonThugCharacters, and that's half the film's tension and atmosphere. There's also TeenagerGivingBirth and UnderqualifiedIntern to make the half competent actors look good by comparison. To the film's credit, the only two people who survive are the most expendable characters. Can't say I expected that!Unlike good cosmic horror flicks, this film doesn't make you afraid of how small and insignificant your existence is in the universe. Nothing about this film is profound or interesting. It's underwhelming at best. You will walk away feeling as though you gained nothing, and as if your time has been wasted. I hate this movie.

We had a movie night with friends and I made my friends (who doesn't like horror movies) watch this film and after the movie finished I was shocked that it was so so so disappointing. Everyone hated it including me. why? Because there was no topic! I really like bad movies too, this is because even they have a story line. But this one had no purpose, nothing made any sense. There was no character development. Yes it did look like from 80's but just with the looks and the OST. It was so facile. And we all already know that it's become fashionable to make movies in the style of 80's in recent years.It's very good but when it is sustained. It had horror elements but there was no horror.

I watched horror Movies all my Life, And Believe me there's nothing new here that elevates The Void to all these praises other Reviews gives It. Someone wrote It's a modern monster Masterpiece?? wait where? Just because it's the first monster Movie with gore in a long time?! It's a bad cheap ripoff of the thing. It was a really cool poster and premise for the The Void that makes it look interesting, but Believe me there's nothing unique about It. It doesn't come Close to better production like black Rainbow, badabook, it follows, Jane doe, and In b-Level even beyond the gates and wolf cop has better actors and Music going on. I give the Void two stars because I could'NT even finish watching it. badly written, poor dialogue, irritating moronic characters. If there's a modern Classic monster Movie you want look elsewhere like Splinter or the host etc, Ofcoarse I want a proper real scary monster Movie that doesn't rely on cgi and and b cheapness..or is a complete drama with a kind monster.. but anyways..the void dosen't deserve the high scores."

They're showcased front and center, with the confidence of a team that knows their monsters have more weight and impact than the myriad CGI scares that have become the standard in modern horror."" The practical effects are really what sell this film. Yes, it is a good film in its own right, and yes it does capture an 80s feel that people love. But all the buzz was about the practical effects, the praise after release has been the effects, and frankly that is what drew me to see it, too. This may change over time, but in the short term that is what makes this movie memorable."

It was filled with terrible acting, very bad make up effects, it jumped from what movie it was trying to be to some other movie and then back again. The only surprises were because they didn't make any sense and were thrown in just to surprise you. Bad. Really, really bad. Please save your time and your brain. Do not watch. The only thing I liked about it was Aaron Poole as Daniel Carter, and he wasn't very good. Which is odd because he was quite good in ""Strange Empire"" showing that the best of actors can suffer from a bad director.

As it stands, unfortunately, the movie wastes an incredible amount of time trying to develop vaguely drawn characters through completely unnecessary exposition all dialog. Give the audience some credit that we can put things together for ourselves, and even if we don't, the movie works fine (if not better) without a whole lot of insight into these characters' backgrounds and motivations. These two creators are obviously very talented and I would be happy to see them develop their craft and style in further films, but I sincerely hope they learn to play to their strengths and make the narratively spare visual feast this movie clearly wants to be."
" Great low-budget 80's style horror
",0.1027,-0.9269,2017-09-25 00:00:00,7,"Had no real idea what to expect when I picked this up, my decision was based almost solely on the cover and the small synopsis on the back, the same way we used to choose movies back in the day. Well I'm glad I did as this was a very pleasant surprise and although it doesn't break any new ground, it was refreshing to see a new horror done in an old style and still manage to work.The setting is a largely abandoned hospital that has recently suffered a major fire. A highway patrolman finds a man, a drug addict, lying in the road and takes him to the hospital for treatment. The hospital is now only run by a skeleton staff of one doctor, 2 nurses and an intern. There are only a handful of patients. Not long after arriving the police officer notices one of the nurses killing one of the patients and seemingly under some kind of hypnotic state as she has removed the skin from her face. After she lunges at the officer with a pair of scissors, she's shot and killed. A state trooper who was already on the way investigating a previous murder relieves the officer of his gun.Somehow the nurse has reanimated and transformed into a grotesque creature killing the trooper. Meanwhile hooded figures have surrounded the hospital not allowing anyone to leave. 2 armed men show up wanting to get their hands on the man who was recently brought in as he apparently has knowledge of what's going on and they believe he's responsible. With communications between the occupants and the outside world cut and the place surrounded, the small group find themselves in a twisted nightmare and a fight for survival as the mystery of what's going on gets more and more complicated until it's revealed that the doctor has been experimenting on reanimation and has instead found a way to transform people believing that they are a higher and more advanced form of life. The doctor has managed to impregnate one of the patients and the remaining nurse, (ex-wife of the police officer) in an attempt to recover his lost daughter. The police officer, 2 gun-men and the addict venture down into he lower levels to locate the missing nurse and find themselves hallucinating. It's at this point the movie gets a little hard to follow as you don't always know what's real and what isn't. In any event, the doctor, who was actually killed earlier has since brought himself back to life and with all his skin removed and using a hidden sub-basement area for his experiments has been able to open a portal into another dimension which represents itself as a ""plains of hell"" complete with black pyramids. The pregnant patient gives birth to a full sized creature which is supposed to be the reincarnation of the doctors daughter. The police officer who is now wounded and near death anyway, grapples with the doctor and they plunge through the portal and into hell. He then reunites with his ex-wife as they stand holding hands at the base of a huge black pyramid.The movie certainly has a familiar feel to it but that doesn't make it any less fun to watch. Anyone who's seen Re- animator, HellRaiser, From Beyond, John Carpenters - The Thing or even movies such as Xtro will find similarities in The Void, and it's clear that the creators of this have deliberately made it that way as they are obvious fans of trashy creature/gore films. The budget in this certainly wasn't high enough to produce the effects to the same quality as huge production features, so instead they opted for low-light more atmospheric shots, where limitations in design were not going to distract the viewer from the overall effect of what they were trying to achieve. It's sad this this only had a limited run in a handful of cinemas as people have really missed out on seeing what can be done using old-school special effects that still hold up today if you know what you're doing and not rely solely on CGI."
" What could have been an amazing horror film held back by incompetent script
",-0.4588,0.9772,2017-09-13 00:00:00,4,"There are some aspects of The Void that are handled amazingly. The lighting, special effects, and setting work really well to give this film an authentic 80s monster flick in the same genre of John Carpenter's The Thing. The plot itself is nothing terribly original, but it isn't uninteresting either.Where the movie begins to fall short, firstly, is in the script. The dialogue just feels clunky and has little natural flow to it, especially in the first half, where setting up the plot is so important. I found it frustrating to be introduced to all of these characters who talk but they don't really... well, communicate much if anything at all. It gets a bit better once the ball starts rolling but this problem, unfortunately, continues throughout most of the film and is noticeably distracting.Second, the acting is a mixed bag. On the one hand, you have a few strong performances from some supporting characters (the lead is alright, but not amazing), and a few truly laughable ones from other characters. And it's not necessarily the actors' fault. The characters themselves aren't written very well and are mostly forgettable. Third, the cinematography itself is... okay. Just okay. It's average and the editing is again, choppy in places. The directors don't take many risks in this department, which is what's made some other horror movies of the last few years really stand out. Couple this with a score is also up and down in terms of quality and you have a film that's watchable but just enough so that it leaves you wishing you'd gotten more out of it."
" Great Practical FX For 80's Horror Fans
",0.1027,-0.9792,2017-09-13 00:00:00,6,"As a love-story written to the practical FX usage of 80's horror, ""The Void"" is a massive success. As a well-written film, not so much.You'll love this aspect of the film if you wish horror movies today looked more like 80's classics such as ""The Thing"", ""Hellraiser"" or ""From Beyond"". Some clear CGI is used here (the bulk coming towards the end), but the clear focus is on practical, bringing to life some fantastic creatures and well-executed gore/body horror. Also of note is the film's use of color, which contributes a lot to its atmospheric moments.Unfortunately, the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired due to its lack of cohesive story, awkward pacing and under-developed characters. This leads to individual scenes that present moments of atmosphere and horror, but lack punch because they just feel thrown in for the sake of filling time instead of being built up with genuine suspense. The characters' interactions and motivations sometimes come off feeling forced and awkward, despite mostly good acting from a lesser-known cast. This makes it hard to invest emotionally into them and takes you out of the movie pretty early on.Bottom line: ""The Void"" is for horror fans who love the practical FX in 80's horror movies of old. The FX make this movie a respectable effort, but are not enough to merit a high priority watch."
" If you like the think, this is good Yes so good!!
",0.8906,0.9761,2017-09-01 00:00:00,10,"The premise of this movie at first feels like a simple creature feature. It's standard horror fare set in a hospital, but this movie goes a little higher concept in its aspirations. There is a lot here just below the surface. The creature effects were some of the best I've ever seen which is unsurprising when you find out that the two directors were respectively a makeup artist and an art director for many years before. All the effects look like they were done practically and if there is any cgi it's unnoticed except for one unfortunate green screen scene. The action was explosive and cathartic in nature. Mostly this film just gives a sense of dread, a sense of insignificance. It doesn't feel like there is any way that these people will survive what is being thrown at them. I'd call it the best Doom movie we will ever get because it does give a good sense of what our collective imaginations have decided hell is like. The triangles and the cult aspect were also welcome additions and the aesthetics it adds subtly changes your reaction to the film in a way I would not have expected.

" Can be enjoyable, but still feels disappointing
",-0.5187,0.978,2017-09-01 00:00:00,6,"The movie is all right, especially from the perspective of horror media. While nearly all horror films released nowadays seem to rely solely on jump scares to get the audience's interest, this movie had no jump scares and relied mostly on its atmosphere, I appreciate that.The effects were quite well done and the idea behind the narrative was alluring and had some fair potential.With that being said, the story is incredibly unsatisfactory. As the movie ended I felt like I had just finished watching a trailer that's one hour and half long. I'd much rather have had the movie's concept be fleshed out throughout a series than have it become an entire feature, because there was no time for character development and nearly everything of interest in the plot was left unanswered.Sure, the movie kept a spooky climate which is important in anything relating to horror, but spooky climate is not enough to make a horror film a good one.The movie starts at an average speed, and you are given a whole bunch of characters that feel like you might grow to like, the beginning of a plot that seems like will be engaging and a few yet- unanswered-questions that you're sure are going to be answered after a while...But then as the movie goes on you start to realize all of the characters are useless, nearly all of them are dead by the end of the film, they were so meaningful that it would make no difference if they weren't even brought onto the film or had major aspects of them be changed. If their deaths were supposed to affect the audience emotionally, it didn't happen. The characters which seem to have the potential to be quite likable are never developed enough to have you be care about them, you'll just watch them die one by one and not feel bothered at all because these characters weren't given enough attention.And the unanswered questions you'd be expecting to be answered? Majority are never discussed again.There's so many plot twists being thrown at your face and so much new information that after a while you're going to start becoming confused, and believe me, you're going to remain like that until the credits roll around.The plot twists are also just a way to shove more vague information into your face, as most of them go completely neglected or just barely cultivated. You barely get anything on the characters' backstories and their motives. There's about 3 characters whose backstory gets touched on, the protagonist Daniel, the antagonist Richard, and the random dude with a random wound on his neck that just keeps the same facial expression on all the time. Nevertheless, while in one hand those three guys' backstories are actually brought up, the amount of unanswered questions we can make about their past surpasses the number of answers and information we are given by the hundreds. Even Richard's motives and backstory, which were the most developed out of any character, felt incredibly insufficient. So many things went unaddressed, ignored and just given in minor vague details that the entirety of the plot feels incomplete. This movie had potential in its concept, one that I truly wanted to see expand, but clearly having it all fit in 90 minutes wasn't possible,and just like I mentioned before, if this story had been adapted into a series rather than into a movie I'm sure it would be much more likely to engross a wider audience. I don't know, some people seem to enjoy open narratives, but when said narratives as open as the Devil's Sinkhole in Texas I don't quite have that much fun with them."
" Could be a ""Hellraiser"" sequel
",0.0,-0.9805,2017-08-29 00:00:00,6,"""The Void"" is a curious and spirited indie B-movie that definitely features more positive elements than negative ones, but ultimately still can't be labeled as a great new genre effort due to its enormous lack of coherence and structure. This largely crowd- funded film comes from the hands of Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski; - 50% of the wondrous Canadian horror collective Astron- 6. The other 50%, Adam Brooks and Matthew Kennedy made ""The Editor"" separately, so for the sake of horror I hope these guys aren't slowly starting to split up! They're simply better when they are all together, like with ""Father's Day"" or ""Manborg"". I read in many reviews that ""The Void"" is a throwback/tribute to the gooey and unhinged splatter flicks from the 1980s. That's certainly true, but it isn't the film's sole reason for existence. Gillespie and Kostanski also have a story to tell, as well as many themes and minor topics they wish to process into their screenplay. Writing a half-decent or logical summary of the plot would be impossible, but the essence of the film (or, at least, I think it is) handles about a man so devastated over the loss of his only daughter that he tried everything – literally everything – to bring her back. During his desperate search, he stumbled upon unearthly alternatives and created horrifying monsters. These creatures are now terrorizing a handful of people in a nearly abandoned hospital. But, before the night is over, it will become clear that one, or even several, of the group members isn't as innocent as he/she looks. Let's start with all the good things! ""The Void"" has tons of suspense and atmosphere, varying from lightly unsettling to downright petrifying. Notably the images of an isolated hospital besieged by hordes of unknown and creepily masked assailants are uncanny, but so are all the things that lurk in the basement and storage rooms. You can tell that Gillespie and Kostanski are 80s horror junkies because all the make- up effects and monstrous creations are good old-fashioned craftsmanship, accomplished without the help of a computer. It's a bloody splatter feast with flamboyant transformations, and nasty massacres! The plot then unexpectedly heads towards a direction that could easily make it a (superior) sequel in the ""Hellraiser"" franchise, with the hospital setting spontaneously turning into pure hell, characters resembling Cenobites and nightmarish scenery that has Clive Barker written all over it. I really have a lot of sympathy for ""The Void"", and therefore I truly wished that the plot – and particularly the last 40-45 minutes – wasn't so confusing and abstract. Towards the climax the story makes less and less sense, so you automatically start losing interest even though they try to compensate the incoherence via more splatter and scary monsters. Despite largely being a genuine horror delight, you're nevertheless left behind feeling somewhat unsatisfied and disappointed, and personally I found this most unfortunate considering the talent and goodwill of the directors."
" Best horror movie since ""The Thing.""
",0.128,0.9803,2017-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Well, well, well, little Alex. Okay, here's the deal. Massive big budget Hollywood movies are now irrevocably forced to be a formula within a formula, with the big money producers never allowing anything resembling authenticity, originality or innovation to be a part of their investment. They are businessmen and behave like realtors, using risk assessment to make movies. This works incredibly well if you are Michael Bay making the newest Transformer movies. Not so well if you are writing the script for the new Star Wars sequel. It's amazing how much they lose due to loss of vision, passion, integrity and for lack of a better word ""soul"" in their movies. As such, all 100 to 300 million blockbusters should be boycotted (yes, Rogue One I'm talking to you), while all Indie flicks taking a big risk should be supported. And now comes The Void, a movie that would have retained a 9 but instead only gets a 7 due the shameless amalgamation of The Thing (even down to the howling other world shriek/howl of the creature). And yet, I loved this one, as I loved ""Darling,"" another awesome Indie venture. The special effects were both intense and incredible for a low budget, the acting very well done, and the script excellent. I was riveted from the first alien mutation smorgasborg to the the second to last scene. Inexplicably, the director and writers could not come up with a better and more understandable ending (e.g. where is the fiend?). So, are you with me? Abandon the awful superficial banality of Hollywood and spend all your celluloid money on Indie. I'm with you."

" A tribute to John Carpenter, more or less
",0.0,0.9293,2017-08-14 00:00:00,5,"If one were to take the scenario from ""Prince of Darkness"", ""The Thing"" or ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (a group of people trapped in a locale that cannot be escaped with danger both surrounding them and inside with them) and combine it with a dash of ""Phantasm (an older man and a younger man who are trying to stop some kind of evil), a dollop of thrice-removed Lovecraft by way of ""Re-Animator"" and the Cthulhu mythos and a hint of ""Silent Hill"", one might wind up with something like this.Strangely, the film seems to be set in the 80's (antiquated radio, old cars, no cell phones) but there is no mention of the time period.The story itself is told in a pretty straightforward way in something near real-time once we arrive at the hospital. Character relationships are revealed primarily through dialogue and there isn't a whole lot of fat hanging off the affair. Creature effects and some VFX seem to be primarily practical; admirable since computer generated imagery wasn't needed to bring about most of what we see.All in all, it's a solid piece of work, but, being primarily a pastiche and tribute, it's sort of like going to see a tribute band; no matter how good they are, they are dependent on the work of a pioneer in order to have something to recycle.I'd recommend seeing any of the movies I name-checked at the start of this over ""The Void"", but it's not a waste of time."
" Hellraiser Lite
",0.0,-0.9713,2017-08-13 00:00:00,5,"Hellraiser 1 and 2 were probably the 1st movies to scare me as a child. I was around 10 or so when I saw them. Obviously, as I got older, they became cheesy, but the actor for Pinhead started to rub off as more movies were made. This movie reminds me a lot of Hellraiser 2. In fact, toward the end we get a copy of the same escape scene and the defeat of the bad guy was similar as well. But unfortunately, the Void lacks character. Hellraiser gave us an image of what hell might be like, and it provided with the iconic cube which can provide a doorway. There was also the people turned demon cinnamon bites... i mean cinobites who added some depth to the plot as they are the end result of what happens to sadistic people. The problem with the Void is we replaced all those things from Hellraiser with blank slates. There was no character to the void. It is not explained and its imagery was not decisive enough to make heads or tails of it. It looked like something out of Stargate. But the spell was cast by some human turned demon so sci-fi went out the window and although we get to know his background, it is not explained how he became powerful nor why other cooperated with him (though they seemed to suffer from instant insanity but it was very selective). Hence, no depth to the story. Last, we replaced the cinobites with the faceless KKK clansmen.It wasn't terrible, but it could have used a bit more character building and better lore. As it stands now I have no interest in seeing a sequel because I have no idea what this 1st movie was about to begin with."
" Does for horror movies what ""Stranger things"" did for TV series....
",-0.5719,0.9929,2017-08-12 00:00:00,8,"It takes an awful lot of self confidence to try and mesh Stuart Gordon's ""Re-animator"" and ""From Beyond"", John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and ""Assault on Precinct 13"", Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" and even Lucio Fulci's ""the Beyond"" into an original new film. It takes even more skill to actually pull off such a balancing act and to produce an individual film that has its own identity but that is exactly what Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski have achieved.Moments of real tension, black humour and some excellent and gory effects - I love the physicality and sense of weight that you get with mechanical effects as opposed to lifeless CGI - all add up to a terrific movie.The cinematography, shot selection and editing all serve to give the film a sense of forward momentum and atmosphere. The soundtrack is always supportive of the action we are seeing on screen and adds greatly to the waking nightmare atmosphere of the film..Aaron Poole, looking like a more down to earth Aaron Paul but without Mr Paul's rather over wrought performances post ""Breaking Bad"", is a likable main character and Kenneth Walsh delivers a wonderfully creepy performance relishing the dialogue and producing a classically evil ""Mad Doctor"" presence as Dr Powell.A film that is full of surprises and some of the scenes - particularly the ones featuring pregnant women! - are extremely tense. Doesn't opt for clichéd characterisation or a Hollywood style resolution and like films such as ""John Dies at the end"" manages to keep you on the back foot from start to finish. A terrific surprise and strongly recommended for people who love the best of 80's creative horror."
" Not worth your time

It owes a lot to John Carpenter's the Thing but it definitely does not come close to the quality of that movie.I never got a sense that anything was written or acted with any purpose. It was just a lot of ideas thrown around and seeing what they'd end up with. The result was mediocre performances and story that doesn't even even try to make sense.There were a few good things about it as follows: Solid cinematography. There were some nice shots throughout but they didn't help serve a stronger movie. Creature and practical effects were well-done considering the lower budget.I've been watching a lot of these lower budget horror movies and they really need to spend more time writing better dialogue and story. I think these elements can save movie with just okay effects but great effects won't save a movie lacking them."

" Great on a visual level, but tries so hard to be ambiguous that it ends up just lacking in plot
",0.0646,0.9313,2017-08-08 00:00:00,7,"The Void should have been one of those great movies that you accidentally find out about, but unfortunately, it's a disappointment. It's about this small group of people stuck in a hospital with some cult standing outside to kill them of they try to escape and monster they worship inside.It starts off pretty good and pretty intense. I love the way the directors relied on the 80s for a visual styles with a use of a neon lighting, a synthish soundtrack and practical effects with some surprising nightmarish imagery. That alone makes the movie stand out. The acting isn't the best, but it's okay. Scenes are thrilling and the visual style makes it all the more interesting. But they focused on that aspect so much that they forgot to have a good script.The plot is a mess. The writers tried way too hard to make an ambiguous movie, but there is a fine line between ambiguous and just unsatisfying (and almost non- existent). Some random subplots are thrown in to flesh out the characters more, but they only further the confusion because the subplots themselves are not very well explained. The movie would be better off without them. Instead, they could have used that to make the plot a bit less non- sensical. I can't help but think that the script feels like a first draft or something.The whole movie, while an eye candy, is a disappointment because it offers nothing on a storytelling level. If you came for the visuals, watch it. If you came for the plot, skip it."

For me it was great to see that again on screen in this new generation. I feel like we don't get enough of these type of movies taking bold/risky choices like The Void, The Mist, Alien and The Thing instead Hollywood filmmakers rely to much on cgi technology.Good plot and acting my only complaint about The Void was character development with (Daniel Carter)Aaron Poole and (Allison Fraser) portray by Kathleen Munroe they didn't show any signs they had a history in their relationship until further in the movie.

""Perhaps those moviegoers will make an association with the mysterious Bermuda triangle. And afterwards, we'll make up stuff to continue the story. We'll see where we end up."" they thought. Well, ""The Void"" could be the result of this brainstorm session. A horror that reminded me of similar films from the 80's when horror effects were created with grimages and prosthetic.Till halfway it was far from bad. You could cut the tension with a knife. It was all quite mysterious and frightening. The used horror elements looked gory and extremely bloody. In short, it felt like a successful horror experiment. Until it completely derailed and followed a path that was hard to comprehend. A psychedelic trip with images from another dimension or planet, an occult ritual and a demonic creature that explains the ultimate goal. Beats me if you fully understand this explanation, because it's all so far-fetched and confusing.I enjoyed the different creatures that appeared throughout the film. Disgusting and grotesque monsters straight from the museum of oddities. The fans of this kind of practical effects will have fun. (Here is a film about those practical effects) Maybe it differs slightly from this movie, but when I watched this flick, I got a Twin Peaks feeling. A totally different subject, but it was also mysterious and bizarre. Same goes for this bizarre movie. And if they had produced this movie in the 80's, you could be certain this would be the start of a successful series. Well, looking at the movie posters the art-design department has created, they could have covered a few seasons already.""The Void"" is undoubtedly a unique film and something you rarely encounter. This can easily be included in ""The hall of cult movies"". However, it's a barrel filled with insanity that didn't make any sense to me at a given moment. The performances aren't really brilliant, but they were all right for such a low-budget movie. The surrealistic atmosphere is omnipresent in the second half. Some story lines aren't developed in detail and leave you behind with more questions. Eventually I wondered what I've watched after all. I'm afraid this is a movie that will only be appreciated by a limited audience. Most of the viewers will be quite contemptuous about this movie. Well, i consider myself being part of the midfield when it comes to an opinion about this bizarre spectacle.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"
" Great Special Effects, Story Incoherent
",0.7783,-0.9177,2017-07-28 00:00:00,3,"This film receives three stars from me for its special effects, but its story deserves zero. What opened with promise turned into an incoherent muddle, and while I don't mind doing a little or even a lot of work, this story had no real plot whatsoever. One basic question I had was: why was all this happening now, at this point in time? Why did the various events that occurred happen in the sequence they did? And if the person allegedly behind all of this had been planning it, why didn't anyone else notice before? How did all of this link up to that alleged house where people were killed, and why were the father and son involved in that? Why did they burn the young woman in the beginning? What happened to all of the people waiting outside? They couldn't all been crushed during that ludicrous scene near the end, could they? Also, why the three births? What led to the first one, and why her and not someone else?I bet the filmmakers couldn't answer these questions, and if they couldn't, the movie should have been made.The acting was so-so, the atmospherics were a bit ridiculous, and in general, this film fails to rise to the level of horror films of the past. Better to have a coherent, scary story than great special effects with no there there. Literally.(BTW: Not really any spoilers in this review, but I don't want to be blacklisted, so just to be careful, I'm checking that box.)"

" Try again...please

Once at the hospital all kinds of killing occurs for no reason.Let me start by saying that the plot of this movie is excellent. It's exciting and could really end up being an excellent film. Unfortunately for us the execution of the plot was done to the most extreme of awfulness.There are a lot of side stories that are thrown in and never fully explained. As a writer if you feel the need to add a character's backstory then it has to be because it advances the plot. In this case, however, I feel as though the writer just needed extra story to fill the emptiness of this script.I'm not sure if it was the actors' choices, the direction the actors were given, or the script itself, but the acting fell extremely flat. It leaves the viewer literally saying ""What the hell?"" Some of the choices made would never be made by a legitimate dynamic character. For example, when the guy who can't speak just stares at the other guy who is being torn to shreds by some monster. He stares for a good 15 to 20 seconds while holding a flare. Seriously? If you want to make a good film then the actions in the story must be realistic within the world that the writer has created. What I mean by this is that if i created superman to be invulnerable to everything except kryptonite, and I have superman stabbed in the heart with kryptonite, then superman is going to die. If he doesn't die, then you have just destroyed the world that you have put your viewers in. This movie destroyed it's own world many many times.The visual effects are decent. They aren't computer generated to the extreme so that helps invite the viewer into the world. Which is why it is so frustrating when the world is destroyed over and over again either by the actors or by the way the story unfolds. It's extremely disappointing that this plot was executed so poorly. Please do not waste your time on this film unless you absolutely want to waste some time of your life.I implore someone to please take this plot and to try again."
" Unavoidable Theft
",0.0,0.9791,2017-07-25 00:00:00,5,"If this became an indie cult-hit, it would be fitting.It would be enormously impossible to describe this movie without giving away too much. There are at least a dozen movies The Void ""borrowed"" from, but to be positive, on its own, it was well shot, well-acted, had strong characters and great graphics. If you're a weirdo horror fan like me and sometimes like to think outside the triangle, this is for you. Not to mention, if I saw this as a kid – which I tried desperately and secretively to see as much horror as I could tolerate back then – I would have nightmares for the remainder of my days.So. If you're like me and like a progressively gruesome CREEPSHOW, watch this and go in as cold as I did. But, make sure you're a fan of horror. A real fan. You'll thank me following.Now that that's out of the way, let's get into the meat. Fair warning: even though I don't come right out and give spoilers, the following might help you put the pieces together too early. As in, before you see this, read further and you'll know close to what you're getting yourself locked into.(My Dream Soundbite for the Poster): The THING about the PHANTASM CRAZIES is that it could be an ASSAULT ON a PRECINCT as THE MIST of LEGION-proportions envelopes the DEMON KNIGHTBREED OF THE LIVING DEAD HELLBOUND to a HELLRAISER.Have I gone too far to also say: JOHN DIES AT THE END?Actually, the only thing this mostly-John Carpenter'esque film left out was a boogeyman in a William Shatner mask. There's a point when I wondered if it's all homage to numerous other horror movies and genres or if it's simply a rip-off, standing on the shoulders of other geniuses. Either way, I tried to desperately see one singular vision here, something the movie wanted to be other than the MIMIC it was.Again, on its own merit, the directors did a fine job of creating the sets, gore and individual characters, but the movie, like THE ABYSS it promises, seems to collapse in itself with such a bizarre and unsatisfying third act. All the sh|t hit the fan and as expected, sh|t went everywhere.That all said, I would recommend it for, ah-hem, sh|ts and giggles, but only as crazy horror entertainment. Nothing to revisit and Lord-willing, no sequels planned. For a scary, hallucinate ride, it's worth the trip.***Final thoughts: Not the movie's fault, but I, no pun, went in and out of consciousness during the third act. I honestly did feel like I was tripping with how enormously odd it got. But, to be fair to the movie, the next night, tonight, I re-watched it from the beginning. And I will say, watching the whole experience (almost) twice (almost) did clear up a lot of what didn't make sense the first go-around.Not that I would recommend two viewings. One time really should fulfill your addiction."

Cringe and whimper as you witness the dread of something you were never meant to understand, because if you do....the sheer knowledge of it will drive you insane.I noticed something about the negative reviews having something in common: they all want everything spelled out to them. Anyone watching this with no knowledge of H.P. Lovecraft is going to expect everything to make perfect sense. In the world of Lovecraft, KNOWLEDGE OF THIS KIND WILL DRIVE YOU INSANE. So you will have to put up with it as if you are not an omnipotent viewer. You will have to stumble around in the dark like these poor feeble humans.

But this movie sucked.First, it's never explained who the 2 guys were at the beginning of the movie--their backstory is murky at best. Then the cop who, though stabbed and without a few quarts of blood, turns into a feisty Rambo during the rest of the movie. The 2 guys follow the cop out to his car...why? Then they follow him into the basement...why? There are no cellphones. But there's a working phone in one room, but they don't call out for help? Too many subplots. In one scene, there were literally 3 emergencies happening: monsters invading one room, 2 bad guys enter the hospital with guns, and then the pregnant woman gets taken hostage. Oh, and the 2 men and the cop are extremely antagonistic towards each other for no reason. Once in the underground ""chamber"", does our hero cop try and find his way back out, after visiting Hell on Earth? No, he slowly opens doors.This film made very little sense, and I could care less about any of the characters, and the ""Thing-like"" monsters were shrouded too much in darkness and strobe lights.

I was wrong.NO SPOILERS: Storyline goes pretty much like John Carpenter's and Clive Barker's best work mashed together (and perhaps Fulci style surrealism blended in imo) Like assault to precinct 13+The Thing+Hellraiser with some Cthulhu references. The Void does not quite get to the level of those masterpieces mentioned but effort is there. Just learned this was crowd funded project so whatever money they got, they used it well. Acting was acceptable, all the technical stuff professionally made and oh boy the effects: All the practical fx and monsters were truly disturbing and cgi was only used when needed.Even though apparently small budget slightly shines through all the effort, it kinds of adds to it. Like some random flick that you picked up from video rental place randomly that appeared to be good instead of random b shlock. Anyhow, every film student should watch this that it is possible to make decent movie without billion dollar budget.

I say relatively as, though the names are unfamiliar, many of the faces were somewhat familiar.The not so good:The writing and dialogue showed extensive influence from some of the true classics of the creature feature genre(?).The plot is a mess. This film can't seem to decide whether it is a supernatural, sci fi or hallucinogenic horror film and the sub-plots are simply tired.Overall:So long as you keep your expectations in check this is a decent B movie.

" A Film for Fans
",0.0,-0.9757,2017-07-08 00:00:00,6,"To start out, I'll say this- I get SOME of the negative reviews. Does this film answer all of its questions? No. Are there parts of it that ""don't make sense""? Sure. And if you're not someone who's familiar with the weird tales/cosmic horror genre, these things may be sore spots for you. There are no big name actors. There are moments where it falls into the trap of having characters be stupid for the sake of attempts to build tension. Also, the costume/symbol of the cultists had me chuckling at times (and ""triangle man, triangle man"" going through my head).That said, there's a lot to like here. The effects are solid, finding a balance between all-out creature features a la The Thing, and showing you snips of the horror amidst shadows and flickering lights, because sometimes less really is more.The story is an homage to horror greats others have mentioned- John Carpenter, Clive Barker, and, mostly, the great HP Lovecraft. This is one of the few Lovecraftian movies that got the sort of effort put into it it deserves. I'd put it on par with Dagon and say it's almost as good as In the Mouth of Madness.There are multiple ""heroes""; a fact that can be jarring for some. What many don't realize though, is that sort of thing is a staple of the genre. Some of those suited to saving the day, folks that look to be the hero, DIE. Everyone can die. Then, someone else has to step up and try to stem the tide before all hell breaks lose. No one human is anywhere near powerful enough to fight, or even really understand, what they're up against. Ultimately, even in victory, there's great loss- because you can't beat cosmic horror. You can only hope to keep it from eating the world for another day.If you're a fan of Lovecraft, I think you'll enjoy this film. If you're a fan of Carpenter and/or Barker, I'm certain you'll appreciate the effects. It's not The Thing. It's not Hellraiser. It is, however, solid enough that I'd watch it again and show it to fellow cosmic horror fans."

The Silent Hill movies were utter garbage and this film is the first in a very long time that has managed to deliver a solid nightmare experience.First, we start with the weak points and end strong just as the movie did.The writers, fkn kill them.. literally drown them in a bucket of their own puke. There weren't many cringe moments but there were a handful such as that Asian chick's (wake up) ""Or what?"" line that was so out of place. (maybe the director is partly to blame for not recognizing how much certain lines didn't work.) What's crazy is that this movie does NOT seem to lack in creativity, imagination or budget but instead suffers from some bad writing/dialog. BUT STOP, AND TRUST ME. This movie should be watched!!! Why? There are ONLY a handful (as in about 5 lines) that were unforgivable. The rest was quite passable. Now on to the good. The sound work/score very nice work. Camera work, 6 to 8 out of 10 (pretty damn good in most scenes, kinda bad in one or two, awesome where it counts) The acting, pretty good considering the sludge lines the writers gave the actors to work with. The acting, not the best, not great, but not at all bad either.So on to the bottom line: 1. Don't pass this up. 2. The opening was kind of rough but you might not notice if you're not a writer, so jump in as this story does. Stick with it. The opening was kind of slow but the slow pace DID NOT last long 5-15mins (nothing really wrong with the opening and it didn't drag on too long but they could've used their time a little better.) Honestly they could have fared better with actors that have much more exp. in acting.I don't want to spoil it, I had to get some of the bad out, but the bad was not that bad when I consider the whole. my mouth hung open for at least the last half if not 3/4ths of the movie, and in a good way! If you're a fan of Silent Hill (the games, starting from 1) you will totally click with this movie. I feel like it was an Ode to Silent Hill or at the very least, a welcome nod. I just wish they got a deal with Silent Hill/ Konami or someone/studio that would have given them better access to higher quality writers/directors because the actors weren't even that bad.7/10, looking for a scary wtf movie? This is it. I was so scared of ending up with another 'indie waste-of-time' movie but I was so splendidly surprised by this movie that I just had to write this review and add my voice (instead of just thumbing up some other review.). As soon as the movie gets going, which is quite soon enough, it keeps going and doesn't let up, instead, it gets crazier and more nightmarish. Im so impressed that I'd love to see a multi-million dollar reboot. At the same time, the job they did was so satisfactory that all they might be able to improve was a handful of lines and maybe plug in a few semi-big name actors because the effects and everything else was great.TL:DR. 7.5/10 Do Not Miss Out On This One!"

My main complaint is that it piles on too much too quickly. These things need to be paced out. It needs to build atmospheric tension before throwing in the monsters. There is a good dividing line as the group finds the mysterious sub-basements. When the group descends, the movie can go crazier. By the end, the horror pacing gets overloaded and the shock value wears thin.The acting is solid although it could improve with bigger names.

But what we have are a number of twists and turns that lead us from thinking, this movies is about something I've seen before...not it's about something else I've seen before...and so on.There is a backstory that lets us know who the important people are, and there are some people who are expendable and they mostly get expended. The acting is not great, but it is sincere, which is what counts for this kind of movie. The dialogue is B-Movie, but again, that doesn't hurt this because it is a b-movie. The things that are not what they seem are not what they seem not to be, which keeps the story interesting.The biggest problem is that the special effects are very 80's, its not that they don't work, but rather that we are a little beyond them at this point as an audience. Some choppy editing happens to move the special effects along without delivering the money shots we expect from CGI effects.I liked the vein of horror that was mined by this movie, it probably have been done better before, but these days you just don't see it that much, and that is why this one was so much fun."
" Deliriously brilliant horror throwback
",0.0258,-0.9513,2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,"The best horror film of the year so far has arrived in the form of The Void, a genuinely spooky, deliriously gruesome 80's throwback that gets tone, pacing and atmosphere right on the money, hitting that sweet spot that not all homages can fully grasp. It's this year's It Follows, I'll put it that way. Balls out ballistic, atmospherically eerie and gorier than a chainsaw mud wrestling competition for spastics, it starts somewhat reigned in and then amps up to feverish nightmare fuel once it gets going, and boy does it ever get going. When emulating classics from distant eras, it's important that these films find their own specific flavour and unique groove, as well as cleverly wearing influences on their sleeve. There's an obvious adoration for John Carpenter's The Thing running through it like an undercurrent, but the filmmakers find their own otherworldly pulse, and the fabulously icky body horror is subservient to an overarching plot involving forces from another dimension beyond ours, which a few lunatics are foolishly trying to contact. That happens later on though, once that special ripcord within the horror genre is pulled, the one that separates an uneasy opening act, a calm before the storm and the craziness to follow as soon as that first inciting attack occurs. The premise? Solid and simple: a small town cop (Aaron Poole) brings a blood soaked drifter to a nearly shut down county hospital run by a weary skeleton crew. No sooner has he arrived, bad stuff starts happening. Some of the night staff go madly insane and start lobbing their own body parts off, while white cloaked cult weirdos gather outside to prevent anyone from leaving the building. A gruff, shotgun toting badass (Daniel Feathers) breaks in and pretty much violently threatens anything that moves. Corpses come alive and transform into glistening, pulsating piles of aborted pizza pocket waste, and to use the time honoured slogan, 'all hell' quite literally breaks loose. The head doctor (veteran character actor Kenneth Welsh, aka Windom Earle, is devilishly scary) clearly knows more than he lets on, and the new bodies pile up on the rotting older ones as dark forces gather for some kind of birth. The actual how's and whys of the story are left appropriately vague, as is tradition in hectic 80's creature features with a supernatural twist. The term 'void' is never mentioned by anyone, rather hinted at by glimpses of a dreamy, austere parallel dimension that calls to mind everything from Altered States to Beyond The Black Rainbow to The Cell. A buddy of mine referred to the film as ""Carpenter Fanboy Porn"", and while that's definitely one angle you can look at it from, there's more than just that, if you widen your gaze. It's clearly a love letter to the man and his work, but it has its own thing going on as well, and feels at once as fresh as the titles it looks up to must have when they came out, and as lovingly nostalgic as a throwback piece should. The filmmakers have deliberately left it open for a sequel as well. Bring on the franchise, I say, the genre can really use stuff like this to fill the Void."
" Skipped the trailer & Don't expected too much
",0.0,-0.9379,2017-06-09 00:00:00,6,"First of all, The Void gave the audience a dark and thrilling ride by the out of the formula plot, astounding way to build-up tension and unveiled the truth. As a independent horror, The Void did it job by brought back the atmosphere of the iconic 80s horror with decent goods but, unfortunately it contains a few disappointmentsThe movie itself reminded me with Baskin ( a Turkish horror back to 2015 – which i also checked the trailer and to be filled with great excitement ), this movie is in that same expectation. To be honest, I don't like the way they used the clever-shots to ignore the must have/detail gore or bloody scene (pay attention you'll find its). Furthermore, the ending obviously placed more questions to the story line in the end, which is the time all the mysteries and unanswered questions have to be explained: The "" silent boy "" just craw out of that underground killing floor in somehow and stacked the monster behind ??? The remaining members of the cult only show up two for scarification, then leave without reason in the end ???Okay! Open ending, fair acting, creepy moments and mysterious cult but the movie carried some holes in the story- telling and failed to deliver the unique idea to all the highly- expect horror lovers."
" There's a difference between unspoken horror and lazy writing.
",-0.7351,0.8037,2017-06-08 00:00:00,3,"When you create a... conceptual void, no pun intended, around the main mystery of the movie, leaving it to the viewer's imagination - that's one thing. But when you straight out just don't tell us anything, and leave an entire movie up to the viewer's interpretation, why not just let us stare at the blank screen, and imagine our own movie entirely, the one that's better hopefully. The visuals are very interesting and creepy, there's a great practical effects work done here, but they alone can't hold the movie! We don't know anything about the characters at the beginning, and we know next to nothing at the end. The characters themselves have no personality and are reduced to a single characteristic by which they can be recognized - the cop, the nurse, the old guy, the pregnant lady, the angry guy, the young guy, the bad guy. They're all boring and unlikable. I guess this movie is OK if you're stoned and just want some heady visuals, but that's about it."
" Pretty Good Cosmic Horror

Nice throwback to 80's horror movies, too. Cast is full of ""discount"" actors - most notably, discount-Aaron Paul (Aaron Poole) and discount-Malcolm McDowell - with solid performances. Bits and pieces of Carpenter, Fulci, Romero and several others. Great practical effects, terrific creatures design and a satisfying amount of gore."
" A nightmarish surprise
",0.2732,-0.7427,2017-05-30 00:00:00,7,"As much as one might try to watch each movie unconditioned, unprejudiced and ready to judge it for what it is, it's really hard to tackle a title such us the void and not to expect another B horror movie filled with cliché and disastrous acting. Luckily, it takes but a few minutes to realize ""The void"" is something else, a bold take on cult movies with a very limited budget.If there's something ""The void"" stands out for, that's its Lovecraftianish feel. You've got the cult, got the creatures, got the parallel dimension, got the eerie atmosphere that spans through the whole film, with a story that tells you just enough to keep you hooked and, at the same time, unaware of what it's going on. Sure, it's got its holes, and contradictions, and its unexplained events, as is to be expected of any indie flick mimicking a Lovecraft universe, but the film is so well paced and the action so packed, you can't but overlook them and let you drown in the thick nightmare and the gore fest.With acting performance that don't let down (except for a few exceptions -ahem, Ellen Wong-) and a solid music score, ""The void"" won't win big awards or be labeled as movie of the year, but it's probably one of the most pleasant surprises 2017 will bring us, we who long longed for a flick drinking from 80s classics such us The thing or Reanimator."
" Movie Review: The Void (2016), directed by Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski
",0.0,-0.8488,2017-05-29 00:00:00,5,"""That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may die."" – H.P. LovecraftResting in his police car on the side of a dark stretch of road, Deputy Daniel Carter is confronted by a man crawling out of the night's shroud and into the headlight beams. Covered in blood and fading from consciousness, the man is rushed to a nearby hospital. Incidentally, Carter's disaffected wife is a resident doctor at this facility. They soon discover the place is surrounded by innumerable (and menacing) robed figures, trapping the hapless patients and hospital staff within. The confines are no sanctuary, as one of the nurses undergoes a hideous transformation, which includes animalistic savagery. Off to a promising start, The Void layers on character conflict amidst surmounting horrors.Easily the most prominent feature of the film is how great it looks, start to finish. The cinematography effectively harnesses the setting and the practical effects are downright gruesome. Enthusiasts will admire the film's audacity to show monsters with clarity, using low lighting for mood rather than obstruction.Sadly, the excellently produced effects are sparse, mostly partitioned to the cramped ending where majority of the creatures have mere seconds of screen time. Why put forth such effort to construct these creatures when they hardly get a chance to be opposition for the cast? Instead, brushed aside as the film makes a mad dash to its conclusion.Despite its best efforts the film suffers a curious shortage of tension. Undoubtedly the result of my disengagement from the characters. Well acted and decently written, they are regrettably underdeveloped and stereotypical. This problem would be lessened had the story proposed significant ideas; or had the central theme of loss been explored more thoroughly.Where the film stumbles most, by my estimate, is that it neglects fundamental qualities of cosmic horror, the subgenre that it categorizes itself. Instead of evaluating the insignificance of humankind, the depressing realization that morality and ethics amount to nothing because our existence is devoid of purpose, or speculating that humans are the playthings of ancient beings of immeasurable power... what we get out of The Void is a plot surrounding a villain committing questionable acts in order to resurrect a lost loved one. Motivation which has been represented in any number of comic book and fantasy villains, and even various cultural mythologies. This is typically used as an effort to humanize a ""bad guy"" but in this case there is no brevity to his cause, especially when you consider (spoiler) that he does indeed revive his deceased child but seems not to give much mind to the fact that she is now an abominable, mindless beast.Also on the villain's agenda is immortality. It remains unexplained why he retains his identity, with minor physical alterations (by comparison), while those he experimented on are deformed monstrosities that are in perpetual agony. When it comes time to address the mysteries The Void oversimplifies, hinting at the grand manipulation of some Lovecraft inspired astral beings through threadbare dialogue. Adopting elements of the subgenre only because it's the minimum requirement rather than positing anything unique. To clarify, I don't take issue with unresolved questions, as horror often benefits from this strategy. Which questions are answered and the lack of substance therein are the reasons for my dissatisfaction.The promise of '80s style nostalgia and special effects prowess (à la John Carpenter's The Thing) is fulfilled, and yet, it feels empty. Not in the way, I imagine, the filmmakers wanted to reference the title. If The Void were given more time and more brainstorming it could have become something memorable. I cannot deny there is definite skill on display, particularly in the imagery, consistency of tone, and expertly utilized budget. If Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski are inclined to give another go at a similarly styled horror production I expect they will put their experience from this project to greater effect.Verdict: Mild RecommendationFor more horror reviews check out http://unsleepinghorror.com/"
" I love the 80s! - Gordon/Carpenter edition
",0.6696,0.9597,2017-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Films are like food. The great ones are cooked with skill and love, using the right ingredients in correct proportion - so the meal ends up being good and good for you. The junk ones will be mostly fat and salt, deep-fried to a crisp - still tastes great, but you don't wanna make a habit of it. The fu-fu health ones may have fancy ingredients and elaborate technique - but despite the creator's best intentions, they oftentimes just don't taste very good. And so on and so forth.The Void is like some sort of BBQ where the admittedly dank sauce took like 20 ingredients and 10 hours to simmer...only to end up marinating a bunch of cheap, flavorless meat. They grilled it well, too. But that just wasn't enough. And no, there are no veggies on the side. No sides at all, just a big dripping hunk of sauced-up -but still flavorless - meat.Look, these folks clearly watched the hell out of everyone's favorite Stuart Gordon and John Carpenter films. And they tried to do right by them. (It's not like Kung Fury, where the guys stuffed whatever they found in each buffet tray into a blender and dumped a can of mountain dew on top.) There are some lovely nasty moments, and the ""look and feel"" of the genre they nailed perfectly. But the writing really drags it down. Which is sad, because if you are gonna make an 80s horror genre film, the first thing you ought to get right is the script - since that's what made so many of those films memorable in the first place. It's not a total failure, but the humor is sparse and lousy, and the characters are pretty wooden and uninspired. And though there's an explanation of sorts for all the evil goings-on, it all feels pretty lazy and derivative, even for a genre film like this.Watch it if you're really into this sort of thing, or bored."
" Very well put together
",0.3384,0.9465,2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"THE VOID is a film I greatly enjoyed. A group of people are trapped in a hospital, while cult members in white robes wait outside as something evil is about to be unleashed. The story is a bit hard to follow as in terms of what outcome the mad doctor is aiming for, but for a little slice of icky horror, it hits the spot. It is not enough however to preach about practical effects and a cool set up, thankfully the directing is also top notch. The practical effects are fantastic, enhance the film and It has atmosphere as well as gruesome effects and weird monsters. In terms of design and style, it is very much The Thing meets Assault on Precinct 13 meets Hellraiser meets The Beyond. It wears its influences like a badge of honour and is not ashamed of it. Sometimes showing your influences too much can hinder and make it a pale imitation (see LIFE which is basically ALIEN) but this entry is strong enough to hold its own. I really enjoyed all the performances, especially Kenneth Welch who manages a measured and sinister turn. At long last I am a satisfied horror customer. I was looking forward to seeing this one for a while and it didn't disappoint."
" Pleasant surprise
",0.6597,0.9899,2017-05-14 00:00:00,6,"""The Void"" is a pleasant surprise which pays its homage to numerous true horror fans favorites like - what came to my mind first - John Carpenter (""Prince of Darkness""), Howard Philip Lovecraft (cosmic horror), Clive Barker (one name : Channard) and Lucio Fulci (""E tu vivrai nel terrore - L'aldilà""). If you know these references, you know what's ""The Void"" is all about - and sorry then for the mild spoilers. You'll notice also the obvious 80's trend of the above - you'll probably be right. Looks like the filmmakers have some cult / generational references. All in all, good job.Everything's not perfect (the editing is sometimes a bit ""choppy"", some plots unresolved, some blurry motivations and weak characterizations / dialogues) but the project defends itself pretty well for this kind of budget : good production values, decent acting, some wow VFX, no cheap jump scares, generous good ol' latex SFX, some satisfying ending, and a movie which is, above all, a love letter to the genre. ""The Void"" speaks for itself."
" Better than Average Horror Movie

It's hard enough to find horror movies worth watching that I tend to judge them on a scale. In other words, I'm not scoring this movie against something like Moonlight or Hacksaw Ridge or even Logan - I'm judging it against other horror movies, most of which just plain suck, in my opinion. This movie, as simple as it might be, at least has some polish: decent acting, some great special effects (especially considering the budget), and just a great mood throughout. Very Lovecraftian. It reminded me a lot of In the Mouth of Madness, actually. I wouldn't be surprised if the writer/director took some inspiration from that movie."

Effects are physical, not much of modern cgi here, and you get plenty of classic vintage horror stuff with latex monsters and tons of blood spurting everywhere. Maybe it's just me but I simply could not connect with the story (or even care about what was going on) left it on just to go with the flow. It's a bit convoluted in that respect.If you enjoy vintage trash-gore stuff, go for it. If not, just pass and watch something else."

When it first started, I thought ""oh no; not another one."" That thought was immediately replaced by ""this is getting better by the minute""! What starts off as a routine night for a sheriff turns into anything but that. He finds a man crawling on the road. He thinks he's found his local drunk for the evening, but the man turns maniacal. When the sheriff takes him to the local hospital for observation, the situation drastically takes a turn for the worse.""The Void"" reminded me very much of something that would have been done by H. P. Lovecraft. The film isn't another one about a masked killer hacking his way through tons of nubile--not to mention stupid-- teens. The level of horror is constantly on the rise here. The acting was a step WAY beyond what you usually find. Every character was believable, and the ending was in place with the movie.

" Horrifying Brilliant - A MUST for 80s Horror Fans
",-0.5574,0.852,2017-05-12 00:00:00,10,"I am a massive fan of 80s/early 90s horror. I am not a fan of lots of CGI and special effects. I prefer make-up effects, gore, proper aesthetics and animatronics. I like horror films that genuinely scare/horrify me, I don't like films built around boring jump-scares. I hate found footage/torture porn. I love a supernatural element to my horror. I don't need the story to be entirely 'believable' or fully explained if it is supernatural (because surely that's the point of the supernatural bit?!). I must like at least some of the leads/good guys & they must react realistically to what is happening around them, or I will lose interest whilst waiting on the boring idiots to die. I hate a romantic/sexy backdrop to characters stories. I just want the film to get on with the real scary stuff. I hate predictable stories, and love twists in a plot.If you are the same as me, then you will absolutely LOVE The Void. It jumps straight into the horror - no messing about, no elaborate back story or attempt to establish the characters as deep and meaningful. In terms of its genre, it's kind of like a satanic/monster/siege hybrid. It has a really cool 80s feel, a delightfully trashy thrill to it (think Hellraiser/Kruger). It also has bits that genuinely horrified me. It's menu description would read, 'lots of meat with a slightly cheesy topping, and a spicy twist'!! If you just want to watch something for the sheer thrill of it, without having to overanalyse or rationalise, then go for The Void! It held my attention the ENTIRE time, no boring bits, just relentless scares. Also, I am not sure I understand why people seem to think the plot wasn't explained....I thought it was explained in the end. It just leaves you with some questions, but in good way. Do you really want your horror to be tied up neatly in a little bow at the end?? This film is fun, not clever. It never kids on to be anything else than what this is - a good old horror!!! More stuff like this please, horror-writers!"
" Strange and boring. Liked how practical effects were used but terrible direction.
",-0.6486,-0.9908,2017-05-10 00:00:00,3,"The Void tries to play out many nostalgia moments that you can expect in a 1980s horror movie. Although, this film may not be a 1980s movie, but directors Steven Kostanski and Jeremy Gillespie try to bring back the practical monster effects. I feel like if this film was released in that decade, it would fit in easily. Now, I have to say The Void is not as scary or thrilling. It does have some interesting concept ideas that it toys around with that feels like it would fit in with an episode of The Twilight Zone. The Void fails to be entertaining, it lacks scares, thrills, and even the acting was not worth mentioning. The plot follows Deputy Daniel (Aaron Poole) who comes across a wounded strange guy James (Evan Stern). He rushes him to the nearest hospital (which is in the middle of nowhere with no traffic or civilians passing by). They soon to learn, there is a cultist group of people, wearing a white robe and a triangular shaped hood. When a person violently attacks another in the hospital and turning into some monster. Daniel and the hospital staff will have to hold out until morning, as they cant escape but also have to battle the evil within the hospital. The plot was interesting and strange. Like I said earlier about it being an episode from twilight zone. Without giving much away, besides the story involving cultist and them trying to sacrifice to release something beyond our imagination. The film fails at making a good horror film with that idea. Lets start with the acting. None of the cast gave a decent performance. They all gave one dimensional performances. Felt like they were reading directly from the script and giving fake obvious reactions with the mood. It was bad. I do find practical effects to be more scary than having cgi used. Look at John Carpenter's films like The Thing which was excellent. When the directions used plenty of flashy lighting when a monster was revealed or quick editing cuts with the camera to build suspense. It was horrible use for this film. Have to give directors props for drawing inspirations with practical effects. But John Carpenter did it better. At least, John Carpenter was able to build characters with his film and some disturbing scares. Also, that's one thing The Void also failed at is characterization. The script gave brief moments to some characters but it felt flat and dull. We learn David and his wife Allison (Kathleen Munroe) marriage is struggling after they lost their baby. We also learn that one of the hospital staff's is an intern. And a father and a son that may know a little bit about the situation on whats going on with the cultist. The script is still hallow with the characters, that you do not feel the suspense when these characters are facing danger. The Void is a terrible horror film that has a boring direction that tries to use cheap techniques to build thrills and scares. Also lacks in acting and a developed script. I do not recommend this film unless you are bored."
" An interesting look at the Cthulhu type story
",0.4019,-0.3832,2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,Why does everybody automatically think Hell whenever a horror movie shows us alternate realities? The movie is obviously more of an occult type movie dealing in alternate dimensions and their deities. Think Cthulhu. I really liked it. Very H P Lovecraft. The visuals were also well done. It seemed like they even spent decent money on the physical effects.
" Body-Horror at Its Fines, Tension at Its Worst
",-0.7506,-0.9886,2017-05-09 00:00:00,5,"The Void is the latest ""80s"" movie to come out in the 2010s. Films like last year's It Follows and Netflix's Stranger Things have revitalized the visual style and flare made so popular by David Cronenberg and John Carpenter. However, one must wonder if these films are simply paying homage to the throwback 80s horror genres, or merely ripping it off. After viewing The Void, it's easy to see the influences that filmmaking duo Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski have lifted off Carpenter, particularly from The Thing and Assault on Precinct 13. The body-horror, the eerie score, and the claustrophobia are all here, yet it retains a vision that truly belongs to the filmmakers. Unfortunately, that vision is the film's biggest flaw. About 20 minutes in the movie falls off the rails in spectacular fashion; not in the sense of the remarkable, but more in the sense of a catastrophic meltdown.The story starts promisingly enough as the town's local Sheriff discovers who he thinks is just a drunk teenager. He soon finds that the boy is covered in blood, and brings him to the nearest hospital which is in the process of relocating. It is here where things start to get truly bizarre, as the hospital is soon overrun with killer cult members, a couple of gun-totting vigilantes, and a giant tentacle monster that starts growing out of one of the nurse's eyeballs. Truly bizarre stuff. And sadly, this frenetic setup is where The Void peaks. It manages to capture the spark of an intriguing idea, but lets the overt creature designs and horrifically gory images run away with the runtime. In fact, the final ten minutes are so stomach-churningly gruesome, so absurd, that you'll either find yourself laughing your ass off or squinting your eyes as you get queasy. I was doing both. It should be worth commending the filmmakers obvious desire to keep things old school. Aside from a few green screen backgrounds, every tentacle and bloody stump in The Void seems to be a practical effect. This is truly a body-horror fan's dream movie. If only more time could have been spent on the script Gillespie and Kostanski hashed out. Most of, nay, all the characters are caricatures of horror stock types we've all seen before. The heroic cop, the mad scientist, the kooky conspiracy nut, and three, count 'em, three pregnant women all show up here. The flat characterizations would be more forgiving if the plot didn't endlessly set up puzzle pieces that never quite fit together. There are constantly things being brought up that are never explained, and while ambiguity in movies is often a good thing, here it just feels lazy and jarring. The few things that are explained make no sense, with character motivations making complete 180s for the convenience of how to set up the next body-horror stunt or cliché double-cross. The Void is the worst kind of horror movie, one that starts with a dynamite first few minutes and then quickly falls apart. At least a bad movie from the get-go let's you know you're watching a disaster. This one just tricks you it might be something worth your time. Yes, the practical effects are sublime, but it lacks a tautness, and atmosphere without proper tension, especially in horror, sinks the production before it even has time to get off the ground. And after 20 minutes of The Void, all the tension has suddenly evaporated into thin air."
" Similar to Fullmetal alchemist
",0.0,0.1655,2017-05-09 00:00:00,4,I found this movie highly touched by Fullmetal Alchemist anime series. here are some points: 1- The Symbols of transformation circles. 2- The concept of returning people from death. 3- The gate to the other dimension (or whatever is it). one may think of this as a coincidence but the transformation circles shown through the movie assure what i'm saying.
" Could Have Been A Masterpiece...
",0.0,-0.9426,2017-05-08 00:00:00,3,"I had read articles where they were touting a kind of 1980's horror film style resurrection. Now being a horror fan and loving the 1980's films of my youth I have to say that my interest was well and truly hyped up with anticipation. I'd already been quietly surprised by 2014's It Follows, which was okay and had a definite John Carpenter feel at times, though it wasn't as strong as any of Carpenter's films. So when I had the chance to view this film I jumped at the chance. Which was a mistake!This should have a been a much better film and it even had the possibility of being a masterpiece... shame everything went wrong with it. I wanted to give this film a 3.5 rating, which you can't do on IMDb so I had to round it down because it isn't worth 4 stars.The story is of a Doctor who is trying to cheat death by making a deal, not with the devil, but with the Lovecraftian Old Ones, and there are tentacles and monsters aplenty.The thing about the film is that by and large, it's boring and way too shouty, with very little characterisation and even though the actors do their best I just couldn't empathise with any of them (which is really strange as we do actually share the same driving force).I could also understand why the article had said the new set of horror movies felt like 1980's because I could count four, possibly five, film references.Hellraiser: The good Doctor Richard Powell, played well by, though not as menacingly as he should have been, Kenneth Welsh was a cross between Uncle Larry and Pinhead.The Keep: Here it's the ""Anti-God"" symbolism and the atmosphere of the ""Evil"" symbol. In the case of The Keep, it's the nickel crosses which are holding something back. In the case of The Void, it's the... Triangle! We all know what a cross symbolises so that's already in our subconscious mind to be exploited. I know the triangle is meant to represent a pyramid but as a symbol of evil, it doesn't work... I never thought Pythagoras was evil, though I never did love mathematics. Then when we get to the scene where our hero's come across a triangle painted on a door as a warning and the tough guy of the pack has a meltdown, the first thought in my head was, ""Run Away they have triangles."" The Thing: The special effects are very reminiscent of John Carpenter's remake, especially where the creature is breaking free of its human host, though her mouth. It had me thinking of the spider head scene in the thing.Assault On Precinct 13 and/or Prince Of Darkness: There are scenes where groups of the Followers are standing outside the hospital to keep the people captive inside. They way this is filmed is very evocative of these two Carpenter films, though not as menacing are as scary. I put this down to the Followers looking like refugees from a KKK meeting, as they are dressed in white robes with one glaringly obvious difference, a black triangle on the front of their masks. I'm sorry, but as I said before a triangle just doesn't cut it as being eerie enough to invoke fear.The major thing which the above movies have is the atmosphere and I'm sorry to say that's one of the main ingredient's missing in The Void. With Carpenter, the atmosphere was created with lighting and music, which he himself composed. There's very little music in The Void and no atmospherical lighting at all.The other is Style, John Carpenter is a master of style and Michael Mann gave it a good try in The Keep. But, in The Void, there's no style or flair whatsoever. The Directors, Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski, just go from scene to scene. With these elements missing, the movie feels tedious as the viewer isn't drawn into the story, there are no goosebumps forming on the backs of their arms and no shivers down the spine. I found my attention drifting and I looked away from the screen often.I would recommend watching the five other films over this one as they are all superior to The Void."

This was supposed to be a horror movie, but the atmosphere was more gloomy than scary. The plot was quite interesting, but at the same time so underwhelming - at no point did I feel for the main characters and those who survived at the end - least of all. Since I didn't quit in the first 5-10 minutes, then acting wasn't completely awful. And, well, seemed like somebody mixed vodka with LSD to film the last bit when action takes place in the basement, quite enjoyed it actually. The summary - if you are into really scary stuff go watch The Ring, if you are into action go watch Doctor Strange, if you are into sci-fi/mystery - go watch Resident Evil."

In the end, you get nice special effects, true horror, but no idea why anything happens to characters you don't really empathize with. Too bad, it could have been one of the greats.I liked the practical special effects and I kind of enjoyed the main character, a policeman that is neither assertive, nor particularly strong in any area, but somehow encompasses the everyman better than anyone. The rest of the characters are not really developed, and their story or value left to the viewer. As they died one by one I cared less and less and focused on the story, which wasn't there.Bottom line: so many things right and a few important things wrong."

It was written and directed by Steven Kostanski (who also wrote and directed a segment of the 2014 anthology horror flick 'ABCS OF DEATH 2') and Jeremy Gillespie; the duo also co-wrote and co-directed the 2011 indie grindhouse flick 'FATHER'S DAY' (with other filmmakers). It stars Aaron Poole, Kenneth Welsh, Daniel Fathers, Kathleen Munroe, Evan Stern, Stephanie Belding and Ellen Wong. The movie was given a limited indie theatrical and VOD release, and it's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics (who have almost all praised it for it's classic 80s nostalgic feel). I also enjoyed it (for it's classic 80s nostalgic feel).Deputy Daniel Carter (Poole) finds a man, named James (Stern), crawling in the middle of the road, covered in blood. He takes him to the local hospital, where his estranged wife Allison (Munroe) works. After handing the man over to the staff there, Daniel finds a nurse (Belding) in a bizarre trance and murdering a patient. He then shoots her in self defense. As the Deputy goes outside, to call for help, he's attacked by crazy cultists. The cultists then surround the hospital and trap everyone inside. Daniel, and the other people there, soon realize that the cultists are the least of their problems. There are murderous creatures about to attack them as well.The film is a lot of fun for people that love low-budget horror movies, especially the kind that came out in the 1980s. It's got some great gore, some cool 80s style effects and an awesome 80s style soundtrack. The movie is like going back in time to the 1980s, if you remember what horror movies were like then. There's not a lot to the story, or character development, but the film is creepy and disturbing enough.

That is all people seem to respond to extraordinary occurrences like normal people would. So great, people don't go looking where the scary parts are (like looking in the attic because there are noises). But it disintegrates from there. There is no real plot, at least that I can discern. There may be a plot but one that only sedulous-intellectuals can discern. I am not one of them. I'm just an average joe, beer drinking, couch potato.

I find little motivation to rise from my couch of loathing in order to trek to the theater for the present ""scariest movie of the year,"" when all too oft, I have been burned by CGI effects and reliance upon jump-scares narrated by whiny teenage c**ts that I honestly hope will die horrific deaths just to scrub their narcissistic whinging from my head.I frequently fall back on horror gems from yesteryear, from the 80's and 90's, to get my fix. Films that rely on dread, and slow, building tension. Films that use practical effects to their fullest potential, and that brings us here.While the acting in this film is a bit stiff, and the writing could use some work, I am, once again, given hope for the future of horror cinema. While some may say that the previous points detract from the overall experience, I urge them to look to the points at which this film excels. The practical effects are stellar. This film may wear its influences on its sleeve, but I have not seen such grotesque creature designs since the golden days of Carpenter and Cronenburg. The sense of slow-building dread throughout the film, though it leaps right out of the gate, is overwhelming, and a joyously ambiguous ending for our protagonist and an excellent soundtrack by Lustmord and others are just the icing on the cake. This has to be my favorite horror film since 2013's ""Evil Dead"" sequel. I had a Lovcraftian itch scratched that I didn't even know I had.This film is far from perfect, but I eagerly await future offerings from this director.Also, it's good to see that Ellen Wong has been up to something interesting lately."

But those movies are better though, no doubt about that. But The Void is not bad to watch once. Unlike other movies in the same genre this time you get an okay cast and a decent story even though you'll be left with some questions. It's all surreal so it's normal you'll have some questions. The special effects are clearly the best thing of the movie. There are some well done abominations that will give some thrills to the weak of heart. The story-line is okay, it could have been better, so don't expect too much about that. It's more about the gore then about the thrills.

Can I say something negative about The Void, well, no. Maybe for some the story will be a void because it's all about weird things, supernatural stuff, I don't know what to say but pick it up without hesitation.If you are a newbee into the genre this is going to be a hell of a ride because nowadays with all those rather low on gore flicks this will get you. For the old school geeks this is a must. I can't say a thing about the story because I would spoil it. And even if I would I couldn't say what's it all about. It's somewhere between Hellraiser (1987) and The Thing (1982). And all the effects are on-camera, no use of CGI. It's messy, it's weird and it has a lot of gore inside. By all means, this is just a throwback to old school horror. Long time ago I've seen such a joy for the eye. Masterpiece.Gore 3/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"
" Some great visual ideas but hampered a bit by the set-up
",0.3716,0.0026,2017-04-26 00:00:00,6,"A policeman finds an injured man crawling along the side of a road one night. He takes him to the local hospital and before long finds the facility surrounded by ominous cloaked figures. The hospital itself appears to be the focal point for some strange supernatural activities.The Void is a little bit of a mixed bag of a movie. On the one hand it sports very nice practical creature effects of the type you generally don't see any more and avoids the use of cheap CGI. This approach benefits the film a lot and gives it a bit of visual quality. The production values in general, while most probably modest, appear pretty good throughout, which is testament to the care taken here with the visual aesthetics in particular. The influence of John Carpenter films such as The Thing (1982) and Prince of Darkness (1987) is pretty evident, as well as the likes of Hellraiser (1987), so this one is an ode to 80's horror. But that's not a bad thing in my book and I have no issue with the film wearing its influences on its sleeve. Another aspect some have a problem with is the enigmatic nature of the story-line but again I don't personally see this as an issue. Supernatural horror films often play better when ambiguity remains, the unknown after all is one of the scariest things and questions are often more interesting than answers. My criticism of the film doesn't come from any of this, where I found fault was in the over-familiarity of the well-worn story of people trapped in a building under siege by evil forces. It's an idea used so many times that it has become a bit tedious. What you generally end up with, and it happens here, are people wandering around corridors while something nasty tries to get to them. It's not a very dynamic set-up and ultimately weakened the film for me. But there are undoubtedly good things to be found in this one, particularly in terms of creature design and visual ideas. If the general set-up had been more interesting it would have been a lot better but as it is, it's definitely a film that offers a number of good things."

Everything that happened, from the phones ringing to the way the characters responded to each other and to different situations (even the characters themselves) I found irritating. To me, there is nothing likable about the way this movie was directed or written and the concept of the Void feels too way- out, irrelevant, dull and pointless. The creature design is just an overly monstrous hodge-podge of boring features and doesn't do anything interesting. I did not enjoy watching this film at all and found it surprisingly bad. I've given it 4/10 to be generous but I wanted to give it a 3 really.

It also did not succeed in building a true sense of dread as I feel we are left guessing far to long just WTF is going on.Where The Void does succeed is in it's final act. Imagine Carpeter's The Thing & Barker's Hellraiser had a child; yep that's what the last 3rd of the Void is & it is pure horror joy to behold. My advice to fellow fans of 80s horror is be patient with the first 45mins because there is something truly amazing with the following 30mins
" Not Good but Still There's Something Worth Watching
",0.1648,-0.9862,2017-04-21 00:00:00,4,"The Void is not a very good movie, though to be honest the film has every conceivable handicap inherited from the trappings of its genre. It's cheaply made, independently produced, terribly acted and starts with a pretty straightforward slasher plot that pits the occupants of a small town hospital against a swath of knife-wielding wackos. The fact that The Void was also crowdfunded only cements the idea that the film will eventually be the butt of a Mystery Science Theater 3000 (1988-Present) episode; if not forgotten outright.Yet I wouldn't be too quick to dismiss this amateurish ode to Lovecraftian horror. As decidedly terrible as it is, the direction and cinematography hints there's someone at home. The moments of suspense are for the most part genuine, as is the all-permeating feeling of bleakness and dread. There are some truly create set-pieces that effectively hide the cheapness of the movie as well as some literate flourishes akin to Kenneth Anger's celluloid abstractions and H.R. Giger's feral body horror.The sustained doom and gloom of the film is complimented admirably by The Void's ghastly third act, which all but gives up on its mundane plot to give us something new. Well, maybe not new, but definitely something mainstream audiences haven't seen since Silent Hill (2006) and haven't seen done well since Hellraiser (1987). If you can forgive all its faults and brush off the film's additional misplaced pretension you may find something worth salvaging here.But of course for every competent tableaux of occult mythos, spooling across the screen there's about a dozen or so moments of eye-rolling stupidity. The group dynamic between this crop of expendables never seems to coalesce or even make sense. There are a few woeful moments of bad character decisions that never seem practical, expedient or in any way reasonable and, as if to draw attention to it's laziness, one character straight-up idiot lectures every piece of our protagonist's (Poole) backstory like he's his biographer. I mean good God, I've seen bad exposition dumps before but this is Village (2004)-level excruciating.The Void is a bad movie. But it's a bad movie the same way Bad Taste (1987) or The Last House on the Left (1972) are bad movies. There are huge problems that could have been solved with a little more money, little more organization, a little more rewrites etc. Yet when it comes to the composite parts (makeup, lighting, art direction) as well as the film's overall vision, co-directors Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski do seem to be headed in the right direction."

Ignore the usual divs slagging the v effective SFX- the Void is the most effective horror I've seen for years and certainly the the best stab at a HP Lovecraft style story yet.

Without giving too much away (if you do decide to attempt this one), ""The Void"" seemingly draws inspiration from h.P. Lovecraft and John Carpenter style films and often feels quite authentic in it's own right. This is one of the main reasons I finished the film, and is by far the most redeeming quality ""The Void"" has.Unfortunately, that is where the positives end. ""The Void"" starts off interestingly enough, but due to poor writing and major pacing issues, things fall apart quickly. Major plot points are not explained in detail whatsoever, and character development is poorly fleshed out as well. To make things worse, the characters aren't all that interesting anyway, which makes it incredibly hard to care about their motives and fate throughout the film.To sum things up succinctly, this is a poorly made film with some decent cinematography and some unique and shocking imagery. The mise-en-scene qualities of this film are ultimately what kept me watching, but due to poor pacing, bad characters and an absolutely horrible ending, ""The Void"" is something most people can, and will, skip."

Now we all know when you really really want to see a particular film and it ends up dashing all your hopes....well...'The Void' is not one of the films. Whatever hopes you have for this film before viewing it, trust me when I say this ""Your horror film prayers have been answered"". Every aspect of the film was on point. From the acting to cinematography, from story to spectacular practical special effects, all top notch. You may hear people say it's a cross between ""Hellraiser and The Thing""...I think people are saying this because it feels like a throwback, a throwback to a time when horror films gave us nightmares. Horror films of late seem to be somewhat commercial, not much thought in the production of them, the look, style, story. With that said I feel 'The Void' stands on it's own and shouldn't be compared to any other horror film, past, present or future. So if you don't want your date digging their nails into your thighs, wear some thigh pads because it's gonna happen. The Void is a ultra intense, horrific odyssey.

Not the best thing ever, but all together a very solid horror film. There was maybe one actor I didn't like, but that's about it. The way the movie is constantly revealing the subplots and past history is amazing, and practical effects have not been done this good since The Thing. I could understand cosmic/lovecraftian horror not being everyone's bread and butter, but even with that, The void holds up pretty well as a normal horror movie.No jump-scares, Good visuals, Tense at all times.

",0.0,0.9727,2017-04-17 00:00:00,4,"So, i heard about this movie kicking asses at some festivals around the world and saw some reviews that really convinced that this was going to be a hell of a ride into a nice sci-fi horror movie.Not quite like that.OK, it was great to see a movie that relies so much on practical effects. At some points, i really felt like i was watching Hellraiser again, and that was great. It was really good to see some flesh & blood monsters instead of those CGI we get all the time. But, this is one of those movies that leaves with more questions than answers, and not in a good way.Anyone is capable of writing some nonsense plot, if you have no commitment AT ALL with closing the circle properly. Just throw a bunch of mysteries and grab us by curiosity and voilá, you have an audience stuck with you for the next hour and a half or so. But The Void will leave will with that ""what the fuc* did i just watch"" feeling for quite some time.And once i heard there are no plans for a sequel, i got even madder at this. Really, it's too easy to write an absurd plot, if you have no concerns about giving it a proper ending. It really feels like a cheat code to me (anyone remember Lost?).I got the point where i was googling about the ending of this film, and, believe it or not, even the guys who makes a living by explaining films, couldn't tell what the heck was that.So, The Void will give you some nice moments if you've experienced the 80s flicks like Hellraiser, The Thing, etc. It's not a complete disaster taking this under consideration. But that was not enough."

" I could stand to see more like this
",0.4201,-0.6591,2017-04-15 00:00:00,7,"Horror has gotten kinda blase the last decade or so with at best unique takes on things that have already been done. Good ones show up here and there like ""Kill List"" but it's rare. The void is not quite one of those but a solid effort to do so earning it in my mind a general recommendation if not a whole-hearted one.The story is somewhat small stakes. It's not building to anything grand scale just a small town lovecraftian scary freak out session. If you're OK with that then you should watch this. If you dug Midnight Meat Train or In the mouth of madness then you'll enjoy this.The only thing I think it suffers from is the Rubber poop monster disease towards the end. The classic Jaws issue of less is more. They do a good job of keeping everything slightly off screen or dimly lit until the end when you get a couple big rubber suit monsters and I always find that a little disappointing. John Carpenter Shows monsters all throughout 1982's ""The Thing"", but he did an amazing job of keeping you in the uncanny valley unsure of whats puppet, make up and syrup. There's a scene towards the end featuring some kinda weak poop suit monsters and it breaks your immersion. They should have worked harder on making it indescribable and subversive. Other than that I like it and would easily recommend a look for any horror fan in the mood for some lovecraftian ""is it hell or something else?"" viewing."

Then you'll like this one.No, it is not at good as any of those classics, but it is 'that kind of film' and has the feel of a movie that should have been made over 25 years ago. It's pretty much seems to be ""that one 80s-horror movie you always missed out on"". The script is weak from start to finish (nearly non-existent), the acting is OK, the direction and editing are lacking at some points, but the practical effects are nice to look at."

And even after reading the synopsis, I just wasn't overly thrilled. But hey, it was labeled as a horror and thus I gave it a chance.And here is where the blindsiding comes in play. This movie came roaring at me like a freight train. If you enjoy the cosmic dread that H. P. Lovecraft established in his published work, then you will definitely find some enjoyment in ""The Void"". That I guarantee.The acting in the movie was quite good, and I was especially impressed with the performance that Aaron Poole (playing Daniel Carter) put on throughout this movie, because he really carried the movie so nicely. It was a shame that Kenneth Welsh didn't have more screen time in the movie, because he could have borough a lot more to the movie than he was allowed to.""The Void"" is a movie that has good effects, most of which are practical effects. But also with a good touch of CGI effects. And the effects were good and believable, and they added a good layer to the movie.Two things that I didn't really like about the movie was the ending and the disciples. First of all, the disciples; they were there in great number, but they were hardly a part of the movie, and what happened to them all? There were just magically gone all of the sudden. Did the movie makers forget about them? And the ending, well it just didn't sit right with me, and left me with an anti-climatic sensation as the movie credits started to roll.However, all in all, ""The Void"" is an entertaining movie, and definitely a movie well-worth checking out if you are a fan of Lovecraftian works. Especially because of the atmosphere that directors Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski managed to muster with this Lovecraftian-inspired movie of theirs.My rating of ""The Void"" is a score of 6 out of 10 stars."
" Good movie. more series to come, I believe.
",0.4404,0.8209,2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"I believe that this is a great movie. It starts like a classic horror movie but does not move on as one. It has its own style. Contains philosophy, religion and beyond. The more usage of the triangle makes me think more of a certain cult. Obviously, the previous history of time and its being symbolized with a triangle, definitely makes me think of that cult. I think more of the series will come to theaters and even game consoles."
" Hellraiser Hospital
",0.0,-0.9706,2017-04-14 00:00:00,4,"My friend Phil recommended The Void to me, saying that it was 'weird'; he clearly understands what I look for in a film. Phil was spot on: The Void is totally bizarre, but a little bit too strange and inexplicable towards the end even for my particular tastes.The film opens intriguingly, with two armed men chasing a young couple, catching the woman and setting her on fire. The young man escapes and is found by local sheriff Daniel Carter (Aaron Poole), who takes him to a nearby hospital that is in the process of closing down. Before long, the armed men show up, keen to kill their escapee. Meanwhile, members of a strange sect surround the hospital, and a series of horrific events occur inside the building.Influenced by the likes of H.P. Lovecraft and Clive Barker (one character turning into a creature closely resembling a Cenobite), the film has bags of atmosphere and a palpable sense of dread, but with zero explanation for the events that unfold, I eventually lost track of what was going on and, consequently, I lost interest. I'm all for a bit of ambiguity, but this one doesn't offer up even the slightest exposition. Who are the hooded people outside the hospital? No idea! Why are people turning into monsters? No idea! Where does the strange triangular gateway lead to? No idea!4/10 for the practical effects and a reasonable dose of splatter, but way too convoluted and baffling to be all that satisfying."
" Lovecraftian horror done right!
",-0.6114,0.9859,2017-04-13 00:00:00,8,"Make no mistake. This might be an indie production but it is easily among the best of horror films I have seen. It's effective in the places it should be and therefore makes you overlook the few flaws it has. Is it worth mentioning what these flaws are? Well, for me they are very minor as it has more to do with some of the special effects used. Obviously a low budget indie production will come across a few limitations. However for the most part the film never sacrifices to a point that you can tell they had to cut corners. Besides the direction and acting made most horrors seem real and true and that is what counts the most, don't you agree? If you are a horror fan you will very easily recognize the references and tributes to some horror classics like The Thing and works of Stuart Gordon. For me that adds to the joy but The Void makes sure you get more treats throughout. The Void has a considerable fast pace overall but never wavers to halt the film to build up tension and suspense. But when things start happening they come at you in full force with all the blood and gore that you would expect from a cosmic horror. This film is yet another proof how less can be more and that you really should be strategic when to use certain effects or not. It easily can be overkill and if that happens it usually becomes tedious and boring. The Void avoids these trappings and as a result stays compelling throughout. Also because it tries real hard to add other elements to maintain a dark and creepy atmosphere to keep you on your toes. Even if the story itself might be too abstract it will never feel as a bad one. Being abstract is fine as long as you keep pretension in check. Directors Jeremy Gillespie Steven Kostanski are very much on top to not go overboard with being serious and consequence is that The Void mostly is simple fun. So glad that there are still film makers out there who just want their audience to have fun and actually make it worth their time. Go watch this as soon as you can, you won't regret it!"

" Lovecraftian flick with an 80's feel.....
",0.0,-0.1372,2017-04-13 00:00:00,7,"The Void is very much in the Lovecraft tradition, with a very 80's makeover. This is not one for the squeamish. It closely follows the tradition laid down by author H.P. Lovecraft, blending the gruesome and grotesque with a religious, pagan-istic vibe. This film revisits the 80's and early 90's too in terms of the films overall feel. Its fantastical, larger than life horror, with a somewhat overdone, cheesy feel. So whether you like this film, really depends on how you feel about this kind of ""homage"". Personally I like The Void but then I was a teen back in the 80's and grew up with this kind of horror fare. Certainly I felt a twinge of nostalgia, watching this film.I personally rate The Void a seven out of ten.You can make your own mind up on this one."

This only lead to my expectations being extremely low. When I found out they weren't making it a comedy, they dropped even lower. I only made it 19 minutes in, and was legitimately passing out. I admittedly did not make it to seemingly the only good points, that being the practical creature effects. And to be perfectly honest, I am a-OK with that."

" Very good, but derivative
",0.2724,0.9627,2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"The Void is a good movie, I liked it. I feel like it's important to lead with those kind of positive words, because I really did enjoy it but I think a lot of people are going to be put off by my next statement that while a good movie, it's not actually original but completely derivative.The void starts out with a bang, with cultists, people attacked, bodies on fire. They definitely want you to know exactly what kind of movie you're walking into. We spend The bulk of the film at an urgent care emergency room (that is about to get shutdown) leaving us with only a skeleton crew; a doctor and a couple of nurses, and an intern. There are also a couple of patients – one of which is a pregnant teenager accompanied by her grandfather. Our main character, a bland, nondescript cop, bursts in with a suspect in tow and shortly thereafter the mayhem begins. When mysterious strangers appear, and the hospital is surrounded by cultists in white robes, the movie begins in earnest. After the first atrocity appears, it begs the question ""Are the cultists trying to get into the hospital or are they trying to keep the people there from getting out? "" The biggest problem with the void is some sloppy writing in places Too often, I felt like I needed to know more, like I was expected to understand things they hadn't yet explained ""Okay, so they're husband and wife? I thought that might be the case but wasn't sure. Are they estranged or just having problems?"" ""I see, he's the kids father That makes sense, but it would help if I knew that half an hour ago"" Stuff like that leads to confusion and pushes you out of the story. We also really need better characterization – the characters are all stereotypes. The nurse, the cop, the doctor, the teen mother, and the slacker. There just isn't any depth to these characters. I'd like to know more about the teenager, do we think somebody else is the father? Is there a mystery about it or regret? When we discover the identity of the child's father, it feels almost tacked on as an afterthought it doesn't feel like it was scripted. I'd like to know more about the father-son relationship, I'd like to know more about the sheriffs secrets, all of those kind of things could've developed these characters. These characters alone can't carry The film without the added attraction of blood and gore Fortunately for us, there are buckets of blood and piles of gore spread throughout this film. These filmmakers are obviously heavily influenced by David Cronenberg and practical effects showcases like Rob Bottin's work. It's evident in the trailer as well, it's the sort of film to remind you just how effective practical work is. There's a weight there that computer FX just don't quite match in visceral terror. Part of me really wants to watch this over again, in a well lit room with a pad and pencil in one hand and my copy of the Psychotronic Encyclopedia in the other to keep score with. The homages come fast and furious You may remember a few years back when somebody took Quinton Tarantino's work and paired it up side-by-side with the films that they claimed he had ripped off This is very much a similar situation, where the filmmakers have taken the best elements and scenes from their favorite horror films and woven them together into a brilliant yet derivative patchwork of classic horror's greatest hits.There are definite callbacks and homage to Reanimator in our main villain. The discovery of the mysterious staircase that wasn't there before, leading deep into the bowels of the subbasement and beyond – I could swear I'm watching Michele Soavi's The Church. There are moments where blue strobes give me an Aliens feel. The framing of the scene when the monstrosity's leg comes down is pulled straight from Cronenberg's The Fly. The victim racing down the clthe-void-blood-200osing hallway with the monster hot on his heels is absolutely pulled from Hellraiser. The discovery of the failed experiments that come to life and come after you reminded me a great deal of Dr Satan's lair in House of 1000 Corpses (though it's more likely they were referencing what ever Rob Zombie was pulling from himself). There are elements that reminded me a great deal the Blind Dead and some of Fulchi's zombie films The face of one of the creatures towards the end, I'm not even sure WHAT it reminds me of – but it certainly reminds me of something I've seen before! One of the end scenes is straight out of The Beyond – in fact, I think they may have actually pulled it off better than in The Beyond! In the end, it works It works because they're doing it correctly – capturing the feel and the moment rather than the clumsy way too many people try to to homage by naming their characters ""Mr Craven ""or ""Mr Romero ""and slapping up horror posters all over their sets. There is none of that here, but rather respectful re-creations of elements from tried-and-true horror films that work and bring you back to those moments. But as I said, the over reliance on this kind of homage mentality keeps it from being original, and that does limit it. The extreme gore, directly aims it at a specific audience that is probably going to get a lot of these references, but may keep away others that could've used this as a gateway to horror. Ultimately, I suspect this will keep it from becoming a classic though I'm sure it will still eventually end up in my own collection The ultimately, it may keep it from becoming a classic though I suspect it will still eventually end up in my own collection"
" Carpenter Like
",0.3612,0.8455,2017-04-12 00:00:00,5,"With an early nod to Romero's original Night of the Living Dead this movie starts off promising with killer cults and creatures. Police officer Daniel Carter (Aaron Poole) encounters a raving and blood soaked man by the side of the road, but the real fun begins when they arrive at the hospital. It's not safe outside, as the hospital becomes surrounded by an ominously still cloaked cult-like crowd, and it's not safe inside either when members of the hospital staff become inexplicably violent and Thing like creatures begin popping out of bodies. This slimy creation goes deep through the eye sockets and deep into the gross out factor. Lots of exploding creature blood and guts mixed with a healthy dose of oozing pissing creature goop. Eventually the gorefest takes a turn into Hellraiser Like territory, and I half expected the main villain (no spoilers here) to beckon to Carter with promises of ""such sights to show you"".The beginning really did it for me with some great imagery of the cloaked figures, the middle not quite as much though it was still a fun gore fest, and the ending not nearly so.If you grew up on Carpenter, Barker and the like, you'll probably love this in spite of its shortcomings."
" If Hellraiser and Silent Hill had a baby it would be The Void..
",0.0,0.8202,2017-04-11 00:00:00,7,If your a fan of the two aforementioned titles then you will enjoy this movie. It's dark and very bloody. Gore hounds will be pleased and it's got a creepy vibe to boot also. Some might say that the character development coulda been better but I was pleased with the pure horror element it was trying to convey. I won't go into the plot cause going into it I knew nothing and that's sort of what kept me in suspense. A film with a bigger budget would have just had CGI in place of the make up gore effects. What makes Films like 1982's The Thing and 1992's Dead Alive is the fun gooey effects that higher budgeted newer polished horror films seem to lack..sometimes there is a beauty in watching a lower budget well made make up effect horror film like Hellraiser or Videodrome..I hope there's a sequel
" Lovecraftian Horror in the classic style of a John Carpenter creature-feature!
",-0.6114,-0.9826,2017-04-11 00:00:00,7,"I sought out THE VOID after watching a review by a Youtube commentator because it sounded right up my alley. I'm glad to say that the movie didn't disappoint.As a fan of 80's horror, especially practical effect creature features like John Carpenter's classic The Thing, David Cronenberg's equally amazing version of The Fly, and Chuck Russel's The Blob, THE VOID is a fantastic throwback to what many consider to be a golden age of monster movie cinema. Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski are clearly talented visual artists with a passion for the tropes of 80's monster movies and their dedication to staying true to this form is clearly demonstrated in THE VOID.One of the things I most appreciate about this old-school breed of horror film making is that it doesn't resort to cheap jump scares, but rather takes the approach of slowly building a sense of dread and helplessness in the face of paranoia, madness, and the supernatural.Some have complained about the ambiguity of the plot, but the very nature of Lovecraftian horror is built upon ambiguous existential terror and indescribable monstrosities born of madness or forces beyond our comprehension. And sometimes, as in the case of THE VOID, less is more.All in all, if you're a fan of monster movies, 80's horror and practical effects wizardry, you are in for a treat. Is it life-changing or groundbreaking? No. But it expertly surfs a wave of nostalgia while delivering effective chills and haunting visuals."
" Far from perfect but still a great sf/horror flick
",0.8402,0.9907,2017-04-11 00:00:00,7,"A bit of Carpenter and a bit of Cronenberg and you get this movie.Premise is as you can see in the synopsis. While some elements are a bit muddled, like hooded figures that are there just to look menacing, The Void comes together pretty nice in the end.Crazy doctor tries to revive his long dead daughter, steps into some really dark and unknown eldrich horror crap, insanity ensues. Monsters, shooting, stabby, stabby, delimbing, decapitations all around and more. Some small character plots are there, mainly between main cast - the cop and his doctor wife.For an indie horror movie, it keeps you nailed to the screen almost the whole time. Yes, the camera work could be way better, and there are some parts where you just don't get what's happening visually because they didn't film it properly. But those events are few and didn't bother me much when they were on screen.Acting is a bit spotty, but mostly good. Both directors come from varied movie backgrounds and they did mostly well, however the editing and directing could be a shade better. Pacing holds the movie pretty well most of the time, but there are moments where you can see directors either have bitten more than they can chew or were asleep at the wheel. But those were really few and far between to give it more than a slight mention here.Effects were almost all practical and they look great... most of the time. Designs of some monsters are a bit messy, but overall they look and act very satisfactory. I would even dare to say that main villain's final form, in terms of quality, looks a level above this movie entirely.Cast is solid, some had more to do, some less. Everyone performed pretty much equally, so there weren't any breakout performances here.To be real here, The Void is mostly 6/10 but a bit of indie charm and potential it has are good enough for me to give it one more point. Some things story wise are not clear exactly and it actually has room to go to The Void Part 2, maybe even a bit bigger than this movie. Will we ever get it? I don't know, but I can recommend this movie for sure to most viewers."

Why was the cop car moved away from the hospital by an extra 100 feet? He still had the keys on him. The cop chopped up his wife with an ax then it shows him in his same cop uniform while she changed clothes holding his hand in the end. Never shown what happened to the Doctor once he entered the void. Why did anyone else need to go into the basement besides the cop looking for his wife?

The void does have some real levels to it and really immerses you into the threat of imminent danger. It's almost reminiscent of silent hill meets Netflix's stranger things. The only thing that drove me bonkers about this film is it's unapologetic and total lack of explanations on plot and drive. It's like being dropped into hell and the devil forgets to tell you how you died. The whole time i was waiting for that one character who seemingly knows all but for ""reasons"" inconveniently discloses the full story by the time its too late. The void is worth watching for sure but don't expect to understand right away. I will definitely be pondering away and painfully scratching my head on this film for a while. It isn't without it's perks though. For the avid horror and sci fan it contains some real tone and plenty of gore to tide you over"

Let me tell you the trailer is put together much better than the movie itself.The start it felt cheap like a poor mans ""The Thing"" the creature looked stupid more comical than scary the acting was atrocious and unbelievable over usage of ""fuck"" simply made it more unbelievable.The story continued without much reason, people trapped in a hospital with cloaked figures stopping them from leaving, mind you the hospital crew had axes and guns and the cloaked figured had knives but still they could not leave?Then we find out the Old dude who was helping them is behind this again a silly addiction to the story with his boring voice telling why he did it.I couldn't continue with the movie and turned it off at this point as it was putting me to sleep.The creature effects where terrible as I said earlier was nothing to scare you. If you enjoy D grade horror with no story line then please go ahead and watch this.

Holy Molly... when this movie began, and for the first twenty minutes of it, I really thought it was going to be a very low budget B movie... it took a while to take off, and when it finally did I was shocked. Be prepared, the movie makes no sense , it's totally out there , but in a really strange weird horror way. I really liked how they just did whatever they wanted to. This movie was just kind of a big f you to convention. It will make horror movie fans happy. It's just one big bloody mess. With some super crazy philosophy added in."

Not one of my favourite films in this particular genre but I think it definitely hits the mark for die-hard horror enthusiasts. A run-down hospital, fire-axes, & cult-like figures wielding knives - despite its ambition - isn't a bad way to spend 90 minutes."

" A perfect movie for a Lovecraft fan
",0.7184,0.9556,2017-04-10 00:00:00,10,"I found ""The void"" by chance, looking to some trailer on the web. I must say that I didn't know what to expect because the trailer was quite confused but I decided to see it and I am so glad I did. The void is one of the few movies that, in my opinion, succeeds in re- creating a Lovecraft-like story. For example, Stuard Gordon's Dagon was another one, different from this and directly inspired by a Lovecraft story.So, if you like old fashion horror with practical effects and you are a Lovecraft fan this is one must-see movie."

Yes its a small budget and a lot of (for me) unknown actors, but with a better script and effects, it could have been a great movie. The idea is good but they made a mess out of it. Especially the effects where really bad and looked like they were from the 70's. I actually hope someone will make a remake of this film, but with a bigger budget and a better script."
" Horror Worth Watching
",-0.4215,0.9377,2017-04-10 00:00:00,7,"I eagerly waited to see this one but didn't have high expectations. Thankfully, was actually ""better"" than I hoped. If you're a fan of H. P. Lovecraft or mythos themed movies, you'll consider this a decent flick. If that sort of ancient elder evil from outside isn't your sort of thing, steer clear of this one. I'd compare it to ""The Resurrected"" with Chris Sarandon. Both have the same visceral creature effects and outer horror theme. Good acting and production values. Basically the story is about a tiny group of people trapped in a nearly abandoned small town hospital while under siege by cultists. There is actually much more going on with the plot with a couple of twists I didn't see coming and while you never get a tired explanation, you do get just enough to piece together what has been going on in this small town. It is action and gore heavy with good old-school creature effects not CGI. Sadly, I don't think we don't get enough of this kind of modern horror movies. I rather enjoyed this and picked up a copy to keep. It isn't anything stellar, but I was pleased with it and can say it was worth watching."
" Hell Hasn't Been This Much Fun In Ages
",-0.3182,0.9913,2017-04-09 00:00:00,7,"First off, I've seen some negative reviews on here that have truly surprised me. After growing up as a fan of Horror during that wonderful 80's period, I can honestly say The Void felt as comfortable as it does uncomfortable, especially if you're a fan of those movies of that time. Yes there are some very strong Clive Barker influences running throughout the movie (both Hellraiser and Nightbreed for example), but I think that's what kept me hooked throughout. That with a dash of Lovecraftian themed fantasy here and there really gave this movie a lot of (albeit dark) charm. I think the last time I saw something this twisted was probably the Turkish movie 'Baskin', with which it shares a lot of similarities, but The Void tends to push the boundaries a bit further, The landscape and atmosphere are nightmarish, imaginative, and gleefully sinister and foreboding. If they set out to create a true vision of hell then I can safely say that they've achieved that goal and then some.Its only true flaw is probably some moments of shoddy dialogue but they by no means break the movie. I can think of a lot of top box office Horror's that have far worse dialogue in fact.One of the things that I found most pleasing was the return to practical effects, so if you're a fan of movies like Carpenter's 'The Thing' then you're in for a real treat here. I think I only saw one moment of CGI in the entire picture, which was extremely refreshing. Nothing kills horror like bad CGI ('Mama', I'm looking at you) but its obvious from the get go that this is a movie made by people who respect the genre, and want to bring it back to its roots.Ignore the negative reviews. If you're a true fan of the genre then I'm sure you'll find a lot to love about this movie. Its one hell of a trip, literally!"

And even Better, they get straight to the Meat of the Movie: Darkness Tension, Desperation, Madness, ACTION.I won't say anything more because it would be a disservice to the Movie. Just WATCH it...Everyone else is bringing in 'The Thing', but I go a different tack: I saw an hair-raising melding of Hellraiser & Lovecraft.This one will be an underground cult classic!"
" A Return to Practical Effects
",0.0,0.9563,2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"""The Void"" has been compared, quite a bit, to John Carpenter's 1980's remake of ""The Thing"", and understandably so. The use of practical effects in this movie are really its highest selling point. Like ""The Thing"", this film does not shy away from showing you some extremely well crafted and effective monsters. However, to compare this film with ""The Thing"" for reasons outside of practical effects, does not make a lot of sense.In short, ""The Void"", is well worth a watch. If the trailer interested you, the movie will absolutely deliver. In a recent rash of indie horror films, ""The Void"" stands out for several reasons. In many of the recent indie horror films, there is usually something glaring that needs to be overlooked in order to make the film enjoyable. Whether it be poor acting, loose plot lines, or an over abundance of things that attempt to shock, many recent indie horror titles have been held back by mediocrity. ""The Void"" as a sum of its individual parts its a well crafted and enjoyable ride that I would feel comfortable recommending to most horror fans. The special effects are easily its highest selling point, but the film is held together by a decent story line and fair acting. The characters are believable for the most part, and the story does a good job explaining the necessity of the effects.Where the film falters the most however, is in its lack of atmosphere. The film feels as if it should be claustrophobic and isolating, but for some reason, I was unable to connect with these themes. I am usually an advocate for a movie telling less to the audience, in order for the viewer to create some of the more frightening aspects in their mind, bu with this particular film, I was left wanting more exposition. Unlike the original ""Hellraiser"" film, ""The Void"" did not leave the origins of the monsters creation completely unexplained, but the origin story was a little to vague, and it made it difficult to connect as deeply to the conclusion of the film as I may have liked.Overall, ""The Void"" is a good movie to throw on for a horror movie night with some friends who enjoy some good over the top gore and monster effects."
" This one's a keeper!
",0.0,-0.7664,2017-04-09 00:00:00,8,"One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time, a shout back to the Lovecraftian classics of the 80s, Re-Animator, From Beyond, etc. Jeffrey Combs would be right at home in this one.The film begins with a brutal slaying at a remote farmhouse. We then see a small-town sheriff stopping to help a man crawling down the road. The sheriff takes him to the local hospital where his ex-wife works. The hospital is in the process of closing down for removal to new premises so only a skeleton staff remains, including a senior doctor, a couple of nurses and a trainee nurse. A pregnant woman near her due date and her father are sitting in the waiting area. The sheriff brings in the injured man and from that moment the tension mounts as events rapidly unfold, the irruption of the murderers from the beginning being the least worrisome of those events. All involved have no idea of the horrors they are about to face. Except, that is, for one of them.I often recommend movies but few as strongly as I recommend this one. Watch it and you will be able to say to your grandkids that you saw this classic horror film when it was first shown."

The bland music does not help this movie much either. The camera is flat throughout the film and the weird editing is just confusing.This awkward B-movie production doesn't offer anything new. The void felt like a student project. And i was glad when it was finally over."
" A solid throwback to late 70s, early 80s horror and creature features.
",-0.4767,0.9925,2017-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Particularly a love letter to practically all of John Carpenter's filmography; containing elements from films such as ""The Thing"", ""Prince of Darkness"", ""The Fog"", and even a little bit of ""Assault on Precinct 13"". I know the last one is not a horror film, but still a great one by Carpenter regardless.Set sometime in the early 80s and taking place over the course of a single night, we follow a small group of people that are trapped inside a hospital as a strange cult awaits them outside while a creature lurks around inside. This was a relatively thrilling sit that I enjoyed immensely. The story starts off intriguing and had me guessing as to what was going on from there. The pacing kept up the momentum so I felt there was always something interesting happening. The scares and the practical effects were executed very effectively. The characters, while nothing groundbreaking or even all that deep, serve the story decent enough. The direction is always tense and the editing knows how much or little to show at all times. There are some twists and turns that I legitimately didn't see coming, plus the film is mostly very well shot.My problems with the film are honestly pretty minor, to the point where I'm not sure it's worth mentioning. Although the ending did leave me with some questions. And I am only referring to literally the last 20 seconds or so of film; I had no clue what was going on exactly, except pretty cinematography. That was all I could gather really. There are a few things that are left unanswered from the main story actually, but enough was answered that I wasn't too bothered by it. Also, while for the most part the film establishes very good camera work, there are some moments where the scenes were so darkly lit that I couldn't tell what was going on. Not often, but enough to notice. That's all I have on this movie to say, I recommend it to anyone who holds a love for early 80s horror. Especially in regards to John Carpenter. I thought it was fun in terms of the effects work that they put in and creepy in all the right ways. This would be a good film to double feature with John Carpenter's ""The Thing""...more so than ""The Thing"" prequel...ugh. I hate that thing. This is a more appropriate prequel to Carpenter's ""The Thing"" than that monstrosity of film. Anyways, what are you waiting for? Halloween? Go watch it!"
" half the work was done here. guess which half?
",0.0,0.9733,2017-04-08 00:00:00,5,"On the effects and style end, The Void is an example to all of those filmmakers who say ""fix it in post"" and want to only use CGI blood instead of actual syrup mixed with whatever. It's an often grotesque display of what can be done with rubber and latex and some imagination. Is it the *most* imaginative use of practical effects? Perhaps not, but it's a lot of the time in the designs, and that the lighting is often cued to make us see the creatures and monsters and tentacles so that it's just real enough without becoming fake. And there are some unsettling choices in direction and atmosphere - how we first are introduced to the mind-control aspect involving a nurse with a scalpel and a face as revealed to be pretty much (gulp) torn off is exciting and disgusting. These directors weren't lazy when it came to effects, but unfortunately they became lazy when it came time to do the *work* of a movie script.These characters and the plot that are cooked up for The Void are half-baked, and the actors, while not necessarily bad, are not given enough to rise up to a challenge of doing something more than what their one (or simply half) dimensional characters require them to do. The set-up is The Thing with a bit of Night of the Living Dead and then there's I'm sure a butt-load of Lovecraft there too, as a small town cop and a few locals (including the cop's pregnant wife, who we don't find out is so until later on) are trapped in a hospital as strange, white hooded figures (no KKK component with that, by the way, they're more like evil monks one sees in horror with cult scnarios) with some powers that sometimes get sort of explained, and other time (mostly) do not. It's a siege movie where people walk slowly in dark hallways and down to dark cellars, and one of the stakes is that the pregnant girl may give birth at any moment. Plus, there may be a... inter- dimensional portal of some kind? This is a movie made by people who clearly (nakedly) love their influences (and maybe smoked a good amount of weed possibly before the script writing process, maybe during too), but they didn't put in what has to be done to make us care about the characters. This is a story where people keep acting mean and obnoxious to one another because, well, DANGER! But one of the aspects of a movie like Carpenter's The Thing is that we get to know and like the characters, and while they're types the actors do a lot of good work to help flesh out the characters too. In here, the actors often have one expression planted on their faces, and it stays there whether it's panic or mean consternation or... more panic. And while I mention that the movie has some good atmosphere, it's not directed with a distinguishing vision that would set it as something unique: a lot of hand-held when it has to get intense, a music cue that comes in when a character does a surprise move into a room or reveal in a shot (and music that becomes extremely loud and *TELLING YOU THIS IS SCARY TIME*-like during some of the more gruesome scenes).But more than with the characters, I don't think the writers/directors did a good job selling us on what the mythology is supposed to be. There's a lot of symbolism involving these triangles and shots of dark-ominous clouds rolling in the sky, and, obviously, there is some fantastical/outer-space/interdimensional things going on. Although we do eventually get two scenes where separate villainous characters monologue to other characters - one being someone who is curiously strapped down with some scary medical things about to happen, and the reveal is a good troubling sight, while the other fills in only the slightest gaps in logic and this by the climax - I wanted to know more about the rules here. There's mind-control and there's sometimes scenes where this world of 'The Void' or what have you shows characters some of their dreams and tries to trick them with fulfilling their desires, and yet it's also not clear how they can do this and why it's only done to some of the characters. And moreover, if they could do mind-control, why doesn't the ultimate main Bad-Baddie get the pregnant woman to him sooner for what is ultimately an impregnation-incubus sort of plot? This is a lot of style that can often work though mostly in the use of practical effects, and I must emphasize that whoever did the effects deserves a free bar for a year for the amount of work put in here (though some of that reaction may be like a guy coming in from being in the CGI desert for so long, whether some of that is derivative too I'm not sure right after seeing it), and at the same time it's sizzle-no-steak. I didn't go with high or low expectations since I didn't know much about the film, but that's usually a good thing I think: show me what you got and try to impress me with a vision that isn't encumbered by a franchise or a major studio breathing down your necks. The Void has its moments, but a lot of it is humorless and without charm (this really could've used, if one is going to go for the 'but its homaging Carpenter and Romero etc' argument like a Ken Foree or Kurt Russell or something, someone who can make me feel some concern for these people), and at worst it may be all too impressed with its own half-baked imagery and context. 5.5/10"

The strength is in the effects and the photography and sound that create the hellish otherworld.

It's pretty much everything I expected it to be, despite my imagination and build up for a movie makes almost every expectation impossible. However, these two Astron-6 alums managed to make me very proud. The hype is real, for sure. This is one of the best ""midnight movies"" I've seen in quite some time. The cast, the music, the photography and oh boy, the effects are outstanding.. Aaron Poole did a great job as the lead man here, which I totally bought as the overly-confused, but able bodied Sheriff with the best line in the entire film, ""I'm keeping the f*cking gun!"" after cocking the shotgun in true cinematic fashion. Really great faces are seen supporting him, and I truly believe none of the characters were throw ways. Each one of them served an essential purpose in the plot line to answer questions and progress the story.The cinematography was quite stylistic and really used the widescreen aspect to its benefit. This allowed for some really simple, but impressive transitions from scene to scene, that if it wasn't used might come off as sloppy cuts. Really great job! The lighting, especially of the exterior of the hospital was something out of John Carpenter. I loved it! Nice yellows and reds!The effects were something I was anticipating since I found out about this film, and realized it was Steven Kostanski and Jeremy Gillespie from Astron-6. These guys do not f*ck around, and I mean that with the happiest childhood wonder in me. If you get to see some of these guys earlier work like Heart Of Karl or Bio-Cop trailer, you will understand my excitement. They pulled no punches allowing practical effects to shine in this film. Monsters, tentacles, suffering zombies-a-plenty. I was so, so happy seeing these actually on screen. This is how you do horror, ladies and gentlemen. So in closing after my nerdy rant here, The Void lived up to my expectations and hit it out of the park with the effects. I love how questions are answered, but answers are questioned at the end of the film. I can't wait to pick this baby up on DVD when its officially released so I can hear the trials and tribulations that went into making this film. This film makes you really question about going down those extra flight of stairs.So, again... if you're outside a cop car, outnumbered by white- cloaked, triangle cult maniacs and you managed to unlock the shotgun just in time, then the deal is off, cause, ""I'm keeping the f*cking gun!"""
" Derivative, humorless, and definitely not scary.
",0.4639,0.7828,2017-04-08 00:00:00,3,"I imagine this is a B-movie. Now, in the '80s / '90s this would be a hit on VHS. I could see it being rented just for the fun. I hoped this will turn into a comedy... it didn't. However, we're in 2017 and this movie is all over the place. Borrowing from all the genre classics, but still not showing us any originality (so much needed in horror). The triangles and the costumes...is that a reference to Mater Suspiria Vision or the Illuminati? What is absolutely, undeniably apparent is that the makers loved 'The Prince of Darkness' so much, they attempted to recreate (and failed) the dread that only Carpenter can. The acting is pretty dull, here and there some inkling of effort, but below satisfying. The camera work (in a broad sense of the word) and the flickering lights (they often flicker in horror, aren't they?) make some scenes impossible to watch through. We should see the creature being smashed up, aren't we? There's no use masking that with incessant strobe-effects and erratic camera shots. Three stars for attempt."
" A good throwback to the 80s horror movies
",-0.2023,0.9205,2017-04-08 00:00:00,7,"After many recent horror movies, this is one of the best that I have seen in a long, long period.The story of the movie, in my opinion wasn't well developed and we have more questions at the end of the movie, than in the beginning. The movie tries to give us answers about experiments that the doctor do to find some sort of immortality, but we, as spectators, we can't solve the mystery behind it, at least I couldn't solve it. I tried to give myself an interpretation to all that: the main topic is the loss of someone special, like a daughter, and the impossibility for the family to accept the death, so maybe the experiments of the doctor are a metaphor to say that we are available to do everything to take back these people, even lose our sanity. Maybe right now I'm trying to find deeper meanings where there aren't any.I was very happy to finally see practical special effect, with, of course, a little bit of help from the CGI, but it wasn't too invasive, so they have made a good balance between these two elements. Let's say that it was a good celebration to Carpenter's work. Also the tension building is very well studied and you don't even know what to really except and when, also because they didn't put any real jumpscare, with loud sounds or music that start suddenly, a very good point of which many horror director should take example from. I suggest this movie to whoever love the horror genre and miss a little bit of the old 80s and 90s school, you won't be disappointed."
" Two Thirds Good One Third Bad
",-0.1531,-0.9358,2017-04-08 00:00:00,6,"Since giving up my Virgin TV package last year I haven't seen too many horror films recently. I can't say I really miss The Horror Channel because most of the films featured would be fairly boring or composed of torture porn. I decided to treat myself to a modern horror , while being somewhat traditional. THE VOID seemed to be the sort of movie I was after but didn't expect too much Low expectations helped and if nothing else it contains a good opening hook of a man and woman escaping a remote farmhouse being pursued by a couple of gun wielding men. At least there were no horny teenagers or hyperactive zombies involved which showed promise . To give it credit THE VOID is very promising. As the story continues you're aware that it's rather derivative with elements of THE THING , ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 and Cronenberg. It might not be as good as these movies but is better than John Carpenter's PRINCE OF DARKNESS a similarity this film shares, Also in its favour there's plenty of incident and there's never a dull moment , though if you don't like gore you won't like THE VOID Alas at the final third of THE VOID the story takes a nosedive and the audience get a confused and confusing HP Lovecraft rip off . You might be able to work out the villain is a deity type of figure from another dimension but apart from that it's never really revealed what is happening or more importantly why it is happening, This is something of a shame because I did find it an involving story but if you don't have a satisfying end then you ultimately end up with an unsatisfying film"

No shortcuts, no coincidental saves, no stupid character choices, and most importantly the writer/director LOVES the media back.The Void LOVES the genre very much and the homages/influences throughout are handled with love. It takes no time for the action to start and the mystery takes its time unfolding.Trades the jump scares in for a more visceral and cerebral approach, hearkening to a more Lovecraft meets John Carpenter than more modern approach.It's not perfect, but there is a lot to love here and it firmly puts the directors on the must-watch list."

The screenplay is very weak in explaining things and leaves to much open for interpretation of what's going on and how much this is based in reality. It seems to be more concerned of displaying practical make-up and FX instead of going the way of telling a cohesive story which could have made this movie great.Having said that,this is not a bad movie but it relies strongly on you to fill in the blanks that this movie chooses not to explore. Also the scenes with a lot of practical effects feel very staged and with lighting that sometimes really annoyed me (swinging lamp from the ceiling being one of 'm).So,the story,police officer stumbles on what he thinks is a drunk guy in the woods but when he takes 'm to the hospital finds out he was attacked by some cult. Another cop arrives from a related crime scene and things go from bad to all out weird from than on.People go crazy for no appear ant reason and cult members gathering outside the hospital are there to make sure that no one can leave the hospital which is soon to be closed anyway because of a fire some weeks before. Shortly after the attackers of the guy show up and the situation gets more intense between them but also everything happening around them. People start coming back from the dead and transform in to monsters (which is often not shown)and it seems to come from an evil force brought to life by this cult. They team up when the ex girlfriend of the police officer is taken in to the morgue that has changed in to a living nightmare and into a portal beyond death.This movie reminded me of hell raiser and the evil dead remake but than without a good back story or a satisfying point of redemption. I found out this was based of an H.P. Lovecraft but if so I feel they took a lot of Lovecraft main themes out of this.The story as a whole has a nice beginning an end but there is to much set up that eventually leads nowhere that waists a story that could have been good or even great.It was entertaining enough for a one time viewing for me,but for a mainstream audience I think it is way to messy and confusing what it's actually trying to tell.I recommend you check it out some time but don't go running to the theater for this one.The actors were good enough in the role given but I also I found it strange that who I thought was the lead was credited fourth in this movie (at least on IMDb) so I don't know what that is all about.So,you don't have to avoid the void but you can very well put it on hold.Saw Kong skull island before this one,it really surprised me.So,next up...."

You get The Void, one of the most deliciously gory and stomach churning films of recent memory. The movie begins with a deceptively simple set-up, and gets progressively more complex as it goes on. The acting is top-notch, especially that of the supporting cast, and the soundtrack is effective and nicely implemented. The star of the show, however, are the incredibly disturbing and disgusting creature designs. It takes a truly depraved mind to create such abominations, and I enjoyed every single frame that was used to showcase each forsaken vessel of filth. It was a masterclass in practical effects, and anyone who says that the craft is dead would get a run for their money after seeing these atrocities.I have seen some pretty entertaining horror films this year, and this is certainly no exception. It was like watching a nightmare unfold in stunning clarity. Everything from the script, the acting and the SFX culminated into one of the most effective creature features I have seen in some time. Go in expecting to be impressed, and you most likely will be. I will be following this creative duo and anticipate their next feature film with bated breath."

",-0.4404,-0.9422,2017-04-07 00:00:00,1,"I watched this film with an open mind going on the so called fabulous reviews previously, If you don't mind the ham acting and used to the really bad sci-fi made for TV movies, then maybe you might just might like it. I for one thought it was absolutely dreadful, It reminds me of a film were the writers have seen various sci-fi and horror flicks and thought I will take a bit from the thing, some from hell raiser and a bit from john carpenters darkness and mash it all together, in other words how people can say this film apart from the really poor cgi and effects say its great, they need a reality check, avoid this film at all costs absolutely awful."
" This is good stuff
",0.4404,0.7537,2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"I will be very short in here... I am 33 male and big fun of horror movies. Original IT, Conjuring, Thing 1982 etc... Good stuff Except of James Wan we are in short of good ""scary"" stuff this generation so i did see this in low expectacion ( no blame ) and yeah, it is not for everyone. But honestly it is in my top 10 of 2007-2017. Give it a shot people! And that is it, no spoilers no nothing. Just if you are serious about this then just watch it and judge it ( OK it is monster movie ). Bye"
" Gruesome, Gore and Messy Journey to Hell
",-0.7964,-0.998,2017-04-07 00:00:00,5,"Two men called Vincent (Daniel Fathers) and Simon (Mik Byskov) hunt down a couple in a farmhouse. The woman is murdered but the man escapes to the woods. Sheriff Daniel Carter (Aaron Poole) finds the wounded man named James (Evan Stern) on a lonely road and brings him to a hospital. It is the night shift and the hospital has only Dr. Richard Powell (Kenneth Welsh), the nurses Allison (Kathleen Munroe), who is Daniel ex-wife, and Beverly (Stephanie Belding) and the trainee nurse Kim (Ellen Wong). There are also the pregnant teenager Maggie (Grace Munro) and her grandfather Ben (James Millington) at the waiting room. Out of the blue, Beverly attacks and kills a patient. Daniel shoots her and then he faints in the bathroom. The state police officer Mitchell (Art Hindle) arrives at the hospital and takes Daniel's gun and cuffs James to the bed. Daniel goes to his car to report the situation but is attacked by a hooded man and returns wounded to the hospital. He finds that the hospital is under siege of hooded men. When they hear James screaming in his room, Daniel finds that Beverly has turned into a monster and is attacking James. He rescues the man, but Vincent and Simon arrive at the hospital trying to kill James. There is a tense situation and James stabs Dr. Powell in the neck and kills him. They learn that the hooded men are not interested to get in the hospital but not let them go. When Dr. Powell revives and attacks Allison, the survivors learn that there is a cult that changes people and some evil force in the spot. ""The Void"" is a gruesome, gore and messy horror film with a journey to hell of the lead characters. The story is confused and weird about a cult and most of the characters are not well developed. Only Allison and Daniel are charismatic and Vincent and Kim are absolutely unpleasant. The conclusion with Allison and Daniel together in a dark place is senseless. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): Not AvailableNote: Pay attention on the FAKE reviews promoting this flick. Click on the name of the reviewer to see how many reviews he has written in IMDb."
" Fantastic!
",0.5983,0.6942,2017-04-07 00:00:00,6,"I went in with very low expectations of this film. I didn't go by the positives reviews I read because IMDb users are known for posting fake reviews by people who either work directly or indirectly for the film they want to promote to drive ticket revenues, and they come on here and post positive fake reviews, for movies like Don't Breathe and Lights Out, two of the worst films of 2016. But I have to admit, The Void was fantastic. It did for me what horror movies should, it had a great story line and well acted characters who all were pretty smart in fighting creatures. One thing burns me in horror films are stupid characters who act weak and clueless throughout the whole film and gin up a little courage at the end. But not this one, This was written properly and everyone did what they had to do. I highly recommend The Void, its a movie for movie goers and horror buffs. I really enjoyed this film. Check it out!"
" A remarkable throwback creature feature
",0.5574,0.9882,2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"I attended a screening of The Void at the Nevermore film festival in Durham, NC. It was a remarkable throwback to classic John Carpenter-style films. I hesitate to list too many details about it, since the feel of the film is very much like a nightmare that might be spoiled if you go in knowing how it turns out. I can say that the creature designs were some of the best I've seen on film in recent years. The feel of the film reminded me a great deal of Silent Hill, perhaps because it shares a lot of the same influences.My few criticisms have to do with the screenplay. The filmmakers do a good job of leaving some mystery, but there's a bit of exposition I felt like I missed that would explain why some of the people take the actions they do. Even so, that didn't detract from the film enough for me to stop enjoying it. It's a minor miracle how nice the film looks given its low budget. The production design was just outstanding. Considering how ambitious the feature is, I think missing the mark by a bit in certain areas is forgivable."
" The less you know, the better. Just go watch it.
",0.4404,0.8863,2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie at the Festival du film Fantastique (Gerardmer, France). We were watching 6 movies per day for 3 days in a row, ""The Void"" was the last movie we were going to see for the day and I had absolutely no idea what it was about. In fact I thought it was a sci-fi movie when we stepped into the theater, and boy am I glad we did not know more ; we were in for quite a ride.If you plan on watching the movie, I strongly advise you to stop reading/watching any type of review, teaser, trailer or any form of info about it. Not that I am going to spoil anything here, but I believe this movie is enjoyed much better if you know absolutely nothing about it. If you've seen the poster you already know too much. OK you might be wondering ""What if I don't like the genre ? I want to know what this is about !"". It's true that this movie is not for everyone, and I can understand that some people will strongly dislike it. Well, just know that if you appreciate the kind of movies John Carpenter was delivering in the 80's, this is for you. Now go !Personnaly, I absolutely loved The Void, it has been a very long time since I felt so much tension while watching a film. The buildup is very well done. This is no ""jump in your seat"" crap. It is the kind of movie that makes you hold your breath and make your blood pressure go up, the kind that makes you feel like you are in a nightmare. The Void will get the same kind of cult status as movies like Event Horizon or In the Mouth of Madness did."
" Modern horror masterpiece
",0.1027,0.9455,2017-01-30 00:00:00,9,"The premise of this movie at first feels like a simple creature feature. It's standard horror fare set in a hospital, but this movie goes a little higher concept in its aspirations. There is a lot here just below the surface. The creature effects were some of the best I've ever seen which is unsurprising when you find out that the two directors were respectively a makeup artist and an art director for many years before. All the effects look like they were done practically and if there is any cgi it's unnoticed except for one unfortunate green screen scene. The action was explosive and cathartic in nature. Mostly this film just gives a sense of dread, a sense of insignificance. It doesn't feel like there is any way that these people will survive what is being thrown at them. I'd call it the best Doom movie we will ever get because it does give a good sense of what our collective imaginations have decided hell is like. The triangles and the cult aspect were also welcome additions and the aesthetics it adds subtly changes your reaction to the film in a way I would not have expected. This was one of the best theater horror experiences I've ever had and one of the best modern horror movies I've seen."
