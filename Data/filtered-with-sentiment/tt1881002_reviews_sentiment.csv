" Arnold takes on zombies ... but far from as expected.
",0.0,0.5922,2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,"Fantastically unexpected, and beautiful film. In a nutshell, the most unzombie-like zombie movie I've ever seen, showing a whole different side of Arnold's acting prowess. The title role is also played very well, but Arnie takes the cake here."
" Pleasantly surprised!
",0.6476,0.8714,2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a big fan of Arnold, but I heard this was a good movie. First of all, it's not your typical zombie movie. Secondly, Arnold has never done a better acting job. It's a very sad, but well made film. It's very heavy and I really felt for the characters. There are some very good supporting characters in this film as well."
" A meditation upon life
",0.0,0.8744,2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Having begun my own journey of more freely allowing myself to empathize with others, I was surprised at how deeply this movie touched me. More than once I found myself imagining the pain and horror that characters must have felt (the terror of being bitten, the self loathing after an incident with a small creature), as well as the intense desire to live (being with friends). Perhaps with current events (see date stamp for a globally recognizable context), the thought of quarantine and losing loved ones allowed this film to settle into me more than it might have when it was first released. During the viewing, I wondered what it would be like to face, as the necroambulists in this film did, a roughly two-week life expectancy. Thus I itched to hasten to the end of the film to plan my purging of things I do not need and would hate to leave to others to sift were I to die in two weeks; itched to prioritize things I would like to and need to do before I myself face the unexpected. And yet I did not want the film to end; a meditation on life, yes, a meditation on the love we feel for our children, our parents, our friends; an acknowledgement that when we are faced with death, we can love others by doing what is most painful for us. Why it took a film to do this when my context could not, I cannot fully answer. It may be that our isolation from one another made me forget others' value while this film brought that value and brevity and sacredness into my living room.This is a thoughtful, if not completely rewatchable, film which within my context gives me an enormous amount of hope. Hope for me - hope for you."
" Sometimes a bit slow
",0.0,0.5927,2021-01-24 00:00:00,6,But still quite decent and unusual zombie movie. Arnie with some good acting in his old days. And with exception of zombies some parallels to the current COVID-19 pandemics.
" Henry Hobson is the next directing genius
",0.0,0.9928,2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,"He cast the ultimate action hero and made him a sympathetic father in - dare I say it - a tear jerker. But not some manipulative, Hollywood-style Oscar-bait melodrama, either. This is a human-scale family drama with real people, believable motivations and relatable emotions.The performances are flawless, which i attribute to Hobson's steady hand and confidence in the material handed to him by writer John Scott. Arnold could enjoy a decent late career playing dramatic characters. But he doesn't need the money or the work. Everyone else from Abigail Breslin to Joely Richardson to the actors playing the town doctor, the local cops, and the BFF should have their phones ringing off their hooks.The cinematography is breathtaking at times, with some sunsets captured so evocatively they could be wall posters.The musical bed - which prominently features rolling thunder as a repeating theme - is perfectly matched to the almost laconic pacing.There aren't too many movies where, after seeing them, I already look forward to watching them again. But not without first sitting quietly for a spell to think about what I had just seen in the first place.Oh, did anyone else mention it's nominally a zombie movie? Because it's really a civil rights drama, if anything. The zombie virus could be AIDS. Could be Covid. The way the infected are rounded up and regarded as disposable non-humans separated from their loved ones has some strong echoes with what happened with HIV/AIDS in the 80s and has to regrettably made a return with Covid in the 2020s.The 5.6 rating Maggie currently has as of my writing this review is a disgrace. I blame Arnold's half-wit action fans, who probably rent this at Blockbuster figuring they'll watch him blast through zombies for 90s minutes and whip off a few quips along the way. Depressing.As for director Henry Hobson, the last time i saw a movie where I was willing to bet all my money the director was going to be the Next Big Thing was David Fincher's Se7en. I'm betting it all on Hobson this time around."

" Great zombie family drama.
",0.6249,-0.25,2020-12-07 00:00:00,9,"Anyone expecting a zombie flick will be disappointed. This is a family drama set against a budding zombie apocalypse backdrop and is visually impeccable, from the non-verbal communication of the actors and the decor to the camera work, lighting and filters. The dialogues and story are realistic, considering the premise, and are brought across well by understated acting from the entire cast."
" Lifeless
",0.0,-0.9072,2020-11-04 00:00:00,5,"My god this film as a mass of contradictions. Thematically it's so interesting, but in effect it's so dull. Schwarzenegger gives one of the best acting performances of his career, but is still somehow hopelessly miscast.Wade (Arnold Schwarzenegger) rescues his daughter from a city ravaged by a disease that slowly turns the infected into zombies. Unfortunately, Maggie (Abigail Breslin) has already been infected and so now must stay at home, undergoing the gradual two-week incubation period, before succumbing. The longer that Wade keeps her at home, before taking her to an infected site, the greater the risk that she may turn and infect someone else, and the rest of the family, and the local police force, begin to lose their patience with him.Effectively, ""Maggie"" is about dealing with a terminal illness. It's a harsh, dour film, as you might expect given that - and it's Zombie trappings only effectively work to highlight why the other characters are scared about what might happen. Maggie says her goodbyes, and tries to accept the fate that's befallen her but Wade stays in bold defiance, fiercely protecting his daughter despite the risk. Like I say, thematically quite interesting - but plot wise it's slow and serious and very art house in its sensibilities.Which then leads me to the other problem. The massive hunk of Austrian Oak at the films centre. It makes sense that he wanted to do it and it's clear that it spoke to him, perhaps tellingly it spoke to him at a time his marriage was collapsing. To be clear, Arnolds performance here is actually quite good, and understated - but he comes with such a weight of historical characters that you assume (or perhaps I assumed) at some point he'll have to defend his homestead, or that there would be some action of some sort - but that's never coming.Also, I don't really feel like this world was genuine. Even if Covid has taught us that people are perhaps less risk averse than we might have thought, that Maggie is allowed any time at home at all and that the world is continuing on as much as it is, seem unrealistic.As said, thematically interesting - but ultimately a dull affair."

",-0.2732,-0.34,2020-10-17 00:00:00,1,Yawn. I already disliked everyone in the movie except Arnie and he isn't enough to make me want to carry on
" Gone from realistic to unrealistic halfway through the movie
",0.0,0.8932,2020-10-12 00:00:00,4,"This could have been a great film but left me a bit disappointed at the end.
The acting, altough not terrible, isn't great.
The storyline is very realistic and I think we can relate in some ways what they are dealing with so that pulls you in immediately.Where this movie lost me is with the many many unbelievable and plain stupid choices that were made.
For instance, there's a deadly virus going round turning people into zombie-like creatures and this girl clearly caught it but her best friend still hugs her and takes her out? And the parents let her go and encourage her to hook up? That makes absolutely no sense!This is one of the many things that made this story unbelievable in the end. I know people can be very stupid and do stupid things but it was just too much. Such a shame."
" Arnold's most underrated movie to date!! A must see!!
",0.0,0.5846,2020-10-09 00:00:00,9,"Its NOT a horror movie it's a thriller with heart. Arnold gives one of his best performances, look at what the actors and director were trying to do, show how an impossible situation can be so devastating and family can make some decisions damn if you do damn if you dont. Watch it as a excellent acted movie with emotion with drama and tension. It's a great watch!!"
" Atypical Arnie.
",0.0,-0.8964,2020-07-08 00:00:00,6,"Don't go in expecting a zombie action carve up. Instead you get a broodingly sedate and humanely intimate drama with grim epidemic horror shades of an encroaching apocalypse. Not just global, but more so on a personal level. Arnold Schwarzenegger's atypical lamenting performance paints an individual constantly fighting their own heavy conscious and aching heart. Knowing how it's going to end, doesn't make the choices any easier. Saying your goodbyes is just as hard, especially to loved ones and these decisions at that time and place under stressful circumstances can affect more than just one person. While ponderous in its progressively decaying structure. The threat is always there, but the fighting devotion between father and his ailing daughter to see it through stays strong til the foreseeable end. How it does finish is nicely captured with what has gone before it. Abigail Breslin does hold her own with a stout-hearted performance as the virus affected daughter."
" PLEASANTLY SURPRISED
",0.6124,0.9407,2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"While I like the big budget, blood and guts zombie genre as much as anybody, I have grown to really love the smaller more emotionally charged offerings from independent filmmakers.Maggie does not disappoint. Arnold Schwarzenegger is excellent as Maggie's devoted father. You can truly feel his pain at knowing what the future holds. A totally different side of Arnold that I've never seen before. The man can act.Abigail Brezhnev is also excellent. Complete opposite of her character in Zombieland. There's no humor in this story.You would be doing yourself a disservice by not giving this movie a shot."
" Not an action or horror movie
",-0.5719,0.454,2020-04-03 00:00:00,4,"The premise was ok. Good idea to make a zombie film from another point of view. Please don't expect an action flick or horror movie. It's none of those! Good acting from some... but... I'm sorry Ahnuld. I'dd love to hang out with you one night. I'm sure you are friendly, interesting, intelligent,... Lots of talents except from conveying deep emotions. You are great as a terminator, and I get you want to be taken seriously as an actor. I'm pretty sure you take acting classes, and it pays off! But it's like a tinitus. You can teach to controll or ignore it. It's less irritating or out there, but you will always know something's off. Acting drama isn't your greatest talent, sorry man."
" Impressive, slowburning, tranquil and true to life portrait of a father, slowly loosing his daughter to illness. Underrated!
",0.5983,0.9597,2020-03-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie is an impressive portrait of a father (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who has to witness the sickness (virus) of his daughter slowly deteriorating. Impressive. True to life. Bleak. The most serious and best acting performance of Arnold Schwarzenegger in his entire career! And I have watched ALL of Arnold's movies...A word of warning though:This is NOT a typical Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. All you action Schwarzenegger fans please do not watch this movie, because you will be disappointed that you wont get to see action or comedy. This is NOT a straightforward horror zombie movie either. All you diehard zombie fans do not watch this movie either, because you will disappointed as well.This movie is ideally suited for a (smaller) arthouse movie audience, who loves to see a GENUINE portrait of love between a father and his daughter. The fact that his daughter is infected with a zombie virus is NOT the main focus of this movie. And however silly that zombie virus story may sound, this is THE most GENUINE story Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever starred in. SERIOUSLY UNDERRATED!"
" Not really a zombie horror flick
",0.4946,-0.7808,2020-02-06 00:00:00,4,"Arnold vs. The Undead? Well, not exactly. If you remove the zombie virus factor, it's a film about a loving father who's little girl is slowly dying from a terminal illness. I wasn't expecting a typical zombie flick, but it could have been a Lifetime movie. The first half is especially dull, simply consisting of the cast moping over the fact that the girl is dying. There's nothing else to the story at that point. It almost put me to sleep. The film as a whole is overly bleak and dramatic. What saves it from being a complete dud is that the cast and performances are decent. Otherwise, it's a one big yawn."
" Fine One
",0.2023,0.8957,2020-01-16 00:00:00,7,"Finally, Mr. Schwarzenegger got also a zombie/virus movie in his portfolio, and like some other icons of action movies (Stallone, Van Damme), he shows once more that he actually can act and not just beat up some dudes. All in all Maggie is a nice addition to the zombie genre with focus on drama. Also we get some good ideas and a good cinematography. Regarding an over- and misused genre, Maggie indeed is almost a masterpiece, but I dare to say that it is a good one - if you are not only craving for some brains and flesh eating undead."
" Maggie
",0.0,-0.9525,2019-12-07 00:00:00,5,"We are used to seeing Arnie flexing his muscles in action and thriller movies, but this was a dramatic departure for him, to do a scary movie of sorts, it was rated well, and it sounded interesting. Basically, in a post-apocalyptic near future in Midwestern United States, following an outbreak of a disease turning people into cannibalistic zombies, called the Necroambulist virus, society is barely under control. Many victims who have been caught in the pandemic, have been placed in quarantine in a hospital for the infected, those bitten by the zombies. Maggie Vogel (Abigail Breslin) calls her father from a broken city under curfew; she tells him she should not seek her and that she loves him. Despite her warning, Maggie's father Wade (Arnold Schwarzenegger) searches two weeks for her, finding her in a hospital, after she was bitten on the arm. Wade's friend Dr. Vern Kaplan (Jodie Moore) releases Maggie to spend her last days with Wade and her family. Her stepmother Caroline (Joely Richardson) asks Wade to take Maggie's younger half-siblings Bobby and Molly (Aidan and Carsen Flowers) to her sister's house to keep them safe. Maggie withdraws from her family, struggling to cope with her hopeless situation and torn about contacting her friends. Despite having no physical pain, she is terrified and despairs over her deteriorating body. Wade has killed other zombies when they have appeared, with no remorse, but despite concerns from friends, he has no intention of killing his own daughter. Friends tell Wade of their own situations where loved ones became infected, and the authorities are patrolling, looking for any people who are diseased. A doctor warns Wade that Maggie's condition is worsening quickly, leaving him three eventual options: she can be quarantined, which Wade refuses; Wade can administer at home the same euthanasia injection offered in quarantine, which he's warned is painful; or Wade can ""make it quick"" himself. Wade and Maggie make the most of their remaining days, reminiscing about Maggie's deceased mother. Despite Maggie's physical deterioration (she's woken by maggots wriggling in her dying arm) she struggles to maintain normality. Caroline realises in horror that Maggie starts to smell human flesh as food, and Maggie one day confesses to helping a trapped fox in the woods but could not help but attack and eat it. Caroline leaves and urges Wade it's time Maggie is taken away. Two officers arrive and Wade fights one of them before Maggie appears, assuring them she has not yet turned. The sympathetic sheriff leaves Wade with a warning that he'd better decide what to do with her before they next come to check on Maggie. Wade and Maggie have a heart-to-heart, she begs him to promise that he will ""make it stop"" before she grows worse. Later, Wade sits alone with his shotgun, still unable to use it. He pretends to sleep when Maggie approaches, her skin now grey and her eyes blackened. She lingers over, on the edge of self-control, and kisses him on the forearm. It ends when Wade places a shell into the shotgun, and Maggie has walked outside, climbed onto the roof and jumps off, with her final memories rushing through her eyes. Also starring Douglas M. Griffin as Ray, J.D. Evermore as Holt, Rachel Whitman Groves as Bonnie and Bryce Romero as Trent. Schwarzenegger proves himself as a good character with this sensitive, and Breslin does well as a teenage girl trying to be normal but is slowly turning into a ravenous monster, this is definitely different to most other zombie movies, it is not a road movie, a load of blood spattering and trying to find the cure, it is a sombre tone and something that pulls at the heart strings a bit, not a bad horror drama. Worth watching!"
" Unique experience you shouldn't pass up. Not quite horror but lets put it on the watch list anyway.
",0.2749,0.9607,2019-11-20 00:00:00,7,Fresh little genre bender that plods along sweetly with a premise that could so easily have been heavy handed and sickly.Schwarzenegger surprises with a restrained but tender performance as a man who has to make some hard choices.It deftly judges the sweetness and darkness of its plot with a excellent sense of atmosphere in a world giving up hope for itself.
" The 5.6 doesn't do this decent drama movie justice
",0.5267,-0.1658,2019-10-20 00:00:00,7,"First of all, this is not a horror movie. You might not even call it a zombie movie, even though people transform into zombies, urging the autorities to put people in quarantain which is the final stage before simply killing them. It's also not an action movie. IIt's an effective drama, that serves well as a metaphore for children groing up, transforming, and the inability of adults to transform with them. The biggest surprise is Arnold Schwarzenegger who makes you forget his action roots and is a loving father who choses his daughter above everything else. But It's mostly Breslin who sucks the audience into her slow and inevitable transformation, and the emotions that comes with it."

" What did critics know
",-0.296,-0.4975,2019-09-28 00:00:00,6,This movie Maggie is a totally underrated underappreciated film when it comes to the critics. While it is a zombie movie it is also a film about a father and daughter and their struggle through the zombie apocalypse and what exactly happens when dealing with loss. What I love about this movie is that wow yes it is a horror film with zombies the centerpiece of this film is all about the father dealing with the fact that he's going to lose his daughter due to the zombie virus in this case the zombie virus is treated more like AIDS or cancer . The raw emotion to this picture is very overwhelming in fact I found myself being more sympathetic to Arnold Schwarzenegger's character that I was worried about the actual zombies or the horror to the film I think if you're looking for a really great drama with horror elements this would be the feeling for you
" Different kind of zombie movie
",0.0,-0.1669,2019-09-24 00:00:00,7,I liked it! Very touching. And really something different. Is it scary? No it's not. It is very interesting . And it is the most realistic zombie movie i've ever seen. All the others i find it hard to believe that a zombie outbreak can happen. But with Maggie it might ?
" Hard for me to judge, but let me try out...
",-0.0516,0.9741,2019-09-05 00:00:00,6,"I will admit right away i am not ""that huge"" into typical zombie flicks and i am not much into drama even tough a few movies like American History X did had an impact on me.So why did i watch this? Arnold of course. But i knew from the start what it was. I made sure of it and to be in the mood to watch it. I knew it was gonna be slow pace, without action, drama oriented and i wouldn't see Arnold like i am use to see him. So no alcohol involved like i do action movies !With that in mind... i think it was ""fine"". Everybody especially the 2 lead had a geat performance and you can feel their struggle. The problem is , outside of the synopsis of the movie, their ain't much that happen. Wade take his daughter Maggie home to spend some time with her before she turn of this uncurable infection, but even if you can feel the love he has for her, the rest is extremely mundane. He does not spend ""quality time"" that much with her, show her things she always wanted to see or stuff like that.So yes it is emotional at time, but not that much. For instance Maggie's friends have a role in the movie, but it feel so secondary.But as i opened this ""review"" i said its hard for me to judge this movie as its really out of my comfort zone, so i hesitated between a 6 and a 7, and i settled on a 6.4 wich goes down to 6.If you like drama a lot, you may find enjoyement there, but be aware its VERY slow paced. I personally am happy i saw it once, i didn't felt ""bored"" even tough not extremely entertained, but i ain't gonna watch it a second time."
" Arnie flexes his (acting) muscles
",0.0,0.9198,2019-08-26 00:00:00,7,"I've probably seen (and enjoyed!) pretty much every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie since 1984's 'The Terminator' (yes, even finding some enjoyment in his pun-filled 'Mr Freeze' performance in 'Batman and Robin' - I'm that much of an Arnie fan). You could say that I have a preconception or two about what I'm going to get when I see his long name over a film's title. And, because of that, I'm writing this review after my SECOND viewing of 2015's 'Maggie.' The reason being, I only got through about a third of the film on its DVD release. Now I've finally accepted what I'm getting I can sit through the whole thing.I should also mention that I loved zombie movies. Not just because 'The Walking Dead' is so popular (well, maybe not lately, but it was pretty cool in its day!), but all the way back from George A Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' saga. Therefore, I was in cinema heaven when I heard Arnie was going to star in a 'zombie movie.' I could only imagine him kitting himself out with all sorts of 'Commando' style weapons and taking on hordes of flesh-eating ghouls with only his pecs and a witty quip or two for protection. It's fair to say that 'Maggie' is not that kind of zombie film.If you believe the trivia online, Arnie didn't actually take payment for his role in this film and its budget is the lowest he's been associated with since 'The Terminator.' Here, he plays 'Wade Vogal' a loving father whose daughter (Maggie - surprise, surprise!) has recently been bitten by a zombie and therefore only has a few weeks left to live. Yes, apparently people here can last 'weeks' before turning into the undead - eat your heart out '28 Days Later.' And, as the title suggests, Arnie isn't technically the focus of the story. Abigale Breslin plays the titular character and effectively carries the movie. She's the one who is faced with the knowledge that she won't be here in only a couple of weeks, or at least will not be the same person she is now, i.e. will be crazing the flesh of her family and risking their lives if she stays with them.So, 'Maggie' is not really your 'Resident Evil' sort of zombie film. Arnie doesn't so much as kill everything that moves with machine guns, but spends his time brooding over the impending doom that he has no way of stopping when it comes to the fate of his daughter. And, if you've ever thought that the big man's acting ability was limited to playing stone cold cyborgs then 'Maggie' goes some way to prove that he can do more than just look menacing in a leather jacket and sunglasses.So, if - like me - you initially sit down to watch a gung-ho action/horror flick with Arnie mowing down endless legions or walking corpses, then you'll probably do what I did and walk away. However, if you're in the mood for something a lot more subtle and bleak with touching performances then this one might be worth adding to your watchlist. Lately, zombie movies have been done every way possible and, although you can probably find some of the themes touched here in other sources, it's still worth a watch it you're a fan of the genre."

Sadly, MAGGIE is one of the worst films I've seen him in, and that's purely because of the direction and script (or lack thereof) rather than Arnie himself; he's typically good and gives a solid performance in this one.Sadly, the rest is trite, an arthouse drama masquerading as a zombie movie. A grieving father struggles to care for his teenage daughter who is rapidly succumbing to a zombie plague sweeping the nation. There's a lot of dialogue about nothing and small-scale scenes of characters arguing, weeping, and wandering around as aimlessly as the screenplay. Arnie's good, but the rest? A real chore to sit through."

The entire time, this film reminded me of a film titled, Carriers. The acting in Maggie was bad, especially by Schwarzenegger, and I can't honestly name any other actor in the film without referencing the cast list. This film was nothing but a cash grab for Arnold!!Other than the terrible acting, the film was reminiscent of romance drama from the Twilight series. Oh boy!! This was not a very good film at all. Schwarzenegger needs to stick to the Terminator franchise, at least then his accent doesn't take away from the film."

Much of the story of the plague is accessed through the background radio, a shock-jock wants all of the infected killed. We learn that crops are also failing and farmers are advised to burn the diseased crops.We see fields burning and Arnie later burns his own infected crops. The countryside is also desolate. Power cuts occur continuously, things are far worse than the authorities pretend.Maybe not as many Zombies as some would like but the darker aspects of the Zombie Outbreak seem to have been missed by some critics.6.5/10."

I kept thinking that it must surely get better but unfortunately for me it never did. Totally boring clap-trap."
" A movie that from beginning there would only be one ending, Just the way it would in detail. With made it even more painful.
",-0.4927,-0.9659,2019-03-05 00:00:00,9,"This IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE. Was quite obvious from the it wasn't from the trailer. Or reviews. Or from the first five minutes. Seems odd that some people expected a zombie gorefest. I came across it advertised as part of the Horror Channel zombie movie season. Seems an odd selection for them but it probably did not cost them much to show it as it seemed an indie film despite the presence of Schwarzenegger. It slipped under my radar when it was released and having seen it now it's a shame it didn't do more well at the cinema.
As I say in my review it was only going to have one ending overall but you were never quite sure what the ultimate details would be and as such no spoilers here.
But because you knew, one way or another, the fate of Maggie would be this blended in very well in the slow pace. You could feel the emotion in the film in a raw, slow burning pain.
The cast were all very good. Schwarzenegger was excellent in portraying the agony of his character. The horror movie element may draw in people who watch a lot of cheap garbage horror flicks. May even give them on what other genres are out there to watch occasionally.
The 'zombie' element was left not fully explained like the brilliant and bad out there. It gave some side interest but you could have removed it and replaced it with a different and real health issue and the film would be the same.
The portrayal of love, death and emotional grief was what was important for me here. I love zombie movies so don't get me wrong. I tend to avoid, for want of a better term, tearjerkers not because I dislike them I just find hard to watch. So I gave a wry smile when this appeared on Horror Channel. Most of their regular viewer would be baffled (they normally show a lot of new low budget crap but the odd good movie pops up so I keep one eye on it).So i wasnt surprised it was not a horror movie. I was surprised by how very good it was."
" Arnie vs zombies? Actually, not exactly
",0.0,-0.1655,2019-03-04 00:00:00,7,"I wrongly assumed this would be hero Arnie shooting up hordes of the undead but thankfully it is not. To start with this is not a zombie move. The creatures here are people infected with a deadly virus, they are not reanimated corpses. Secondly, the emphasis here is as much on drama - the father/daughter relationship - as it is on horror. While these apocalyptic zombie/infected movies have been done to death at least here we have a different and much welcome twist. The movie may be too slow for some but to me that's one of it's strengths. Arnie and Abigail Breslin put in excellent performances as father and daughter. The rest of the cast are fine too. Pleasently surprised by Maggie."

Impossible to plot spoiler.The zombie effects are minimal. The film is more about living with someone with a contagious terminal disease, although I am not sure why they felt the need to fabricate one.

" Terminator in Zombieland!
",0.0,0.9953,2018-05-04 00:00:00,4,"Maggie is a movie that seems it was made to make you cry more than scream.
In an post-apocalyptical world Abby Breslin is bitten by a zombie and her father (the Governator) has the task of not terminate but stay at his daughter's side while she's slowly transforming into a zombie in a matter of few days.
Maggie isn't an action movie although it has all the elements present in one and not even an horror movie either,only occasionaly.
Instead of just copying A-level Hollywood productions like World War Z this is a very intimistic picture about what happens when you're transforming slowly into a zombie.
It is like John Cassavetes had make a zombie movie with almost all scenes being interiors with plenty of dialogue and family life being looked closely while we see it being turned to pieces.
Focusing not on the flesh-eating creatures but in the effects of being bitten by one is without a doubt smart and original,but unfortunately Maggie fails more than it succeeds. 
First of all we don't see Abby's attack that left her arm bitten.It could've been without a doubt a strong visceral scene by we being introduced to the title character and almost immediately after that she gets violently attacked by a zombie.After the hospital where she's in gives her the permission to just leave the quarantine while she's still human and simply come back to her house and family,waiting that when the stages of the infection gets worse her parents will take her back to the hospital.Really?That is really absurd because she's infected with a zombie virus clearly infectious and they gonna simply let her leave to go home?I'm sorry but that doesn't make any sense but on the one hand I understand the makers of the movie didn't want Abby to spend the entire movie immobile in a hospital bed with daddy Arnold by her side.It woul've been a very boring although realistic movie.
With Abby back home we can see how her disease affects everybody and everything she's next to and that generates genuine human emotions that echoes from the screen.
But also other problem is that the dialogue isn't deep enough as it should've been and the interactions between Arnold (father) and Abby (daughter) aren't as deep and sstisfactory as it should've been.
The incidental silence that permeates the movie is more empty than atmospheric.It just serves to show how minimal the script is really.
Of course Arnold and Abby have their moments (Abby the most in my opinion) but the dialogue and the performances are very restrained and when a movie talks about human drama and someone losing his loved one forever,being restrained is not a good choice for a movie like that.
This movie was a great opportunity for Arnold show his acting skills for drama in a rare role and I really think he's a very talented actor and he gives a good performance in a decent role but it makes you wishing for more as like the movie itself.I even find it surprising a movie that was the opportunity that Arnold waited for years to play a good dramatic role and at the end it was something so restrained for him to play.
For the movie to be better and with more pacing Arnold could've been more intense and obsessed in finding a cure for his daughter throughout the story in a way similar to Denzel Washington in John Q.The movie could've been more intense and more strongly-plotted.And since the zombie action is so minimal why don't give the few of the scenes featuring zombies a little more of depth?The bitting scene that should've been brief and intense;a great opportunity for Abby freak out and give an acting and drama show and also the scenes when she's slowly transforming herself into a zombie also could've been a great opportunity for her to show a great dramatic performance like Jeff Goldblum transforming himself into a giant fly but that isn't shown so we as it should have.
For example one scene that could've been scary is when the half-zombie Abby walks in the woods and eats a live red-fox,but nothing of that is shown,is only mentioned visually and verbally.What a disappointment.That scene could've been effectively revolting and a good moment for Abby to deliver a very good frightening performance.
When it comes to zombies and human drama this movie lacks both.It could've been more unsettling and graphic.
On the paper Maggie could've been a great opportunity to see a zombie movie that is also a metaphor about a disfunctional family and zombie infection serving as a metaphor of epidemics that can happen in the present like venereal diseases or the HIV.
If the makers of the movie had the same cleverness of George A. Romero to make his movies great metaphors it could've been an excellent picture,but unfortunately that is not the case.
Another ironic disappointment is that at the end of the movie we don't even see the transformation completed at all.This is without questioning the time for booing.
The movie's subtleties are in fact its biggest sin.
Maggie talks about plenty of things but rarely shows them so what's the purpose of the movie after all?
By the end Maggie is a movie thats you wanting for more,a lot more,it's pretty boring and could've been better without having commitment with drama.
However still the movie's concept is original and promising and just by that I'll have to give the movie points and it also has Arnold Schwarzenegger in it and it has zombies to...occasionaly.
My Rating 4 out of 10."

" Literally the worst movie I've ever seen
",-0.6249,0.5106,2018-03-29 00:00:00,1,There is no entertainment value in this movie what so ever. Nothing happens until at the very end she jumps off the roof. Amazing ending to cap off a horrible movie.
" A Wasted Opportunity
",-0.1027,0.7763,2018-02-09 00:00:00,3,"This film is bleak and ultimately pretty boring. Unfortunately. Because I like the premise and the take on the zombie genre.The premise is simple: Arnie plays Wade, a farmer/father just trying to look after his daughter after she gets bitten by a zombie and begins the multiple week transformation into a zombie. This creates the chance for the nuance of the zombie genre to really flex its metaphorical undertones and really have a slow paced and personal look at the ramifications of dehumanising someone into a monster. I dig the hell out of that. Zombies are more than just flesh eating creatures and this takes a dig at trying to explore how transformations destroy relationships, the community, and even the person dealing with their inevitable loss of personhood. It becomes a story analogous to knowing your loved one will die of a terminal illness in two weeks and the hardship that causes.Unfortunately this brilliant idea gets bogged down in utterly dull banality. It's. Just. So. Dull. It took me I think 15 minutes before the thought occurred to me: this must be a first time director. And it is! The pacing is so off. I decided to watch it because it was only an hour and a half (and not including credits it's less than that) so figured hey, nice quick movie to enjoy at the end of the day. Nah. What ensues is a director more focused on silent inconsistently shaky shots of characters (mostly Arnie) brooding and having some kind of internal struggle over some super important element of the story but after the hundredth artsy cut away shot or silent 20 second scene it feels like this just didn't have enough content for a full length film. It's soooo sllooowwww. I checked MULTIPLE TIMES to see how much time I had left until the end because I just wanted this to be over but I'd invested too much time to give up on it. I wanted it to redeem itself. I wanted it to lift itself up out of the bland drudge through the slow decay of Abigail Breslin's character (the titular Maggie) into something more poignant, or at least... interesting. But it doesn't. Any tension by the end and replaced with frustration. You know where this is going the moment it starts.The characters aren't interesting. Arnie plays a father figure. That's... about it. What does he like? He likes keeping his daughter around. There's a scene where they actually seem to bond with each other and are a proper father/daughter duo. The rest I don't care. All the other characters? Well I have the cast list open in a separate tab in case I feel like checking names because I don't know a single one. I can't think of any defining traits about these people besides the archetypes they're meant to fit into for the sake of narrative elements. There's the... (switches tab) step-mother? Oh I thought she was her aunt. Caroline. Who... is just present for someone to be uncomfortable about the whole situation. There's the two cops (who Arnie clumsily reveals he is close friends with through heavy handed expositionary dialogue) who warn Arnie that they'll intervene if Maggie goes too far. They're interchangeable nobodies who exist to serve a single purpose and I feel no reason why who they are affects the plot in any way.The cinematography, much like my experience for an hour and a half, is bleak. The colour grading is overdone. It doesn't so much set the tone as demand you feel sad. We get it dude, you were a scene kid when a teenager. You're very excited to show us your latest film school project. It genuinely just feels like if someone slowed down a heavy metal music video but then removed all the music, sporadically added dialogue, then slowed it down way too much. It hurts me. It hurts me so bad.This movie is meant to have a soul. It really should and I know it wants to be a deep examination of a little girl losing her humanity before her eyes and the pain it's causing her father but he just comes off as distant and flat. This was a good draft that just never got rewritten to really hit the nail of all the ideas it was going for on the head."
" I loved it!
",0.636,0.9921,2017-11-21 00:00:00,10,"I just re-watched it and it's still one of the best horror/drama films of the decade. This is about that Maggie (Abigail Breslin) was bitten by a zombie, she gradually becomes into a zombie, Arnold cares for her until she must eventually be quarantined. It didn't deserve all the hate while people were expecting an action flick with Arnold or a full gory zombie film like 'World War Z'. It's okay if a lot people found it boring because it is a slow-burn movie, but I enjoyed it the way it is. Arnold was terrific and he gave one of his finest performances ever. I love how he played a dramatic character. Abigail Breslin was also fantastic too. It's well acted, written, directed. The cinematography and color-grading were all that great. Maggie is beautifully shot, emotional, touching, sad movie about love and loss.9.5/10"
" A pleasant surprise
",0.6597,0.825,2017-10-20 00:00:00,7,"Picking this movie, I was thinking ""oh here's the Terminator fighting zombies"". Figured it to be a silly action movie. And it wasn't! As said by one reviewer, this is ""a unique voice in a crowded genre"". Make no mistake, it's a zombie movie... But not the sort we're used to. And it makes a very good mark simply by treating the zombies as people. This turn of events may sound silly to readers, but the movie is worth it, in every way. We dread the necroambulants, as much as we care for them. Kudos to Arnold Schwarzenegger, who displays a fine range of fine acting here. This might be his greatest role yet, very distant from his one liners packed with action. He shows a sensibility that was unknown to me until this movie. Congratulations. Abigail Breslin shows herself very far from Little Miss Sunshine and gives a soaring performance. As Maggie, she conveyed both the horror and dread of being a zombie AND the pain of being terminally ill. The cinematography is sharp, and it rolls smoothly with the soundtrack to deliver an atmosphere of both pain and fear throughout the movie. I enjoyed this very much and was fairly surprised by it."
" Tiresome forlorn drama about life after the 'zombie apocalypse' with Schwarzenegger & Abigail Breslin
",0.0,-0.954,2017-10-15 00:00:00,4,"RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Henry Hobson, ""Maggie"" stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a father in the Midwest who must deal with his teen daughter (Abigail Breslin) after she becomes infected by an outbreak that slowly morphs people into cannibalistic zombies. He has up to eight weeks to (1.) take her to a fatal quarantine, (2.) give her poison, (3.) shoot her in the head or (4.) allow her to become a zombie and threaten everyone around him. Joely Richardson plays the concerned stepmother, Rachel Whitman Groves a neighbor with the same problem and Raeden Greer a friend of Maggie's (Breslin).This is a low-key horror drama rather than a horror thriller, like most zombie-oriented flicks. The story presumably takes place several months after the events of ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) and near the beginning of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), not that ""Maggie"" is connected to George Romero's classic zombie movies. I wonder if the story takes place during that general timeframe because the phones and vehicles seem to indicate this, not that it really matters.""Maggie"" takes the material dead seriously with a downbeat tone akin to ""Stake Land"" (2010), but without the action/adventure. I could take the one-note maudlin air IF there were enough interesting things to maintain one's attention, but the movie is burdened by frustrating characters and miscellaneous illogic or unconvincing things that needed worked out of the script. I'm not going to say more because I don't want to ruin the movie for potential viewers. Let's just say that the father's a clueless doofus and the stepmother, doctor and cops are all wise.Abigail Breslin was 18 during shooting and is one of the cutest girls to walk the face of the earth, but don't expect any of that here.

The film is set after a pandemic where an infection turns people into flesh-eating zombies. The government knows how the virus works and after being infected there is only a certain amount of time before the victim turns ravenous for human flesh. Before that time comes the infected are collected by the government or local law enforcement and put into quarantine and then terminated.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Abigail Breslin play father (Wade) and daughter (Maggie) caught up in the horrific situation of the daughter being infected. Both give outstanding, heartfelt performances which are beautifully captured and portrayed by first- time director Henry Hobson. There's nothing messy or out of place in this film, no boring lulls or unnecessary anything. It is extremely well-written and scripted. It comes across as natural. It's not really enjoyable per se as it is sad and the ending is of course is inevitable. But it is a pleasure to witness Arnold Schwarzenegger and Abigail Breslin give such wonderful performances."

I've heard many criticism about the movie being slow, but it has to be slow to give time to those fine details that only come through the fine print. And they do come through.I'm still stunned - something that not many movies managed to achieve. And this movie definitely deserves some serious awards, terrible shame that it didn't get in front of the mainstream audience.It is a unique addition to the zombie genre, making it believable and realistic.Powerful and horroristic.

It's a post zombie apocalypse dream world where you can call, get gas, go out at night, where human held the pandemic with measures such as quarantine sounds realistic.. The fact that an infected needs several weeks to mutated helps. The movie demands to the viewer a lot, it demands to dig inside your very own soul. What would you do ? Kill you own child, send him/her to a purgatory called quarantine, set him/her free. I do not know myself, but I wonder in each and every frames of the movie what would I do.I liked when the movie focused in the loneliness of the infected. They are scared as the non-infected are scared. They are afraid and the deportation reminds the darkest time of our own history. The concentration camp so called quarantine.It reminds me also how I was afraid of the people with AID in the beginning of the pandemic back to the eighties. I like it a lot."
" A very tragic and different take on the zombie horror genre
",-0.7902,-0.9732,2017-06-08 00:00:00,8,"Farmer Wade Vogel (a fine and affecting performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger) discovers that his teenage daughter Maggie (a touching and credible portrayal by Abigail Breslin) has been infected with a lethal virus that slowly transforms people into zombies. Wade decides to stay with Maggie to the bitter end knowing full well in advance that at some point he will have to make a difficult decision concerning Maggie's ultimate fate.Director Henry Hobson maintains a leisurely pace throughout and ably crafts a bleak and brooding somber tone rife with despair and melancholy about the unfortunate frailty and fleeting nature of basic human existence. John Scott 3's thoughtful and reflective script refreshingly eschews the usual formulaic end-of-the-world apocalyptic scenario in favor of offering instead a sad and subdued dramatic meditation on life, death, and mortality. Moreover, this film further works as a deeply moving ode to a father's unwavering love for and protective loyalty to his beloved daughter. Breslin and Schwarzenegger do sterling work in their demanding roles; they receive sturdy support from Joely Richardson as Maggie's distraught and frightened stepmother Caroline, Douglas M. Griffin as sympathetic sheriff Ray, J.D. Evermore as mean deputy Holt, Jodie Moore as the amiable and helpful Dr. Vern Kaplan, Bryce Romero as the doomed Trent, and Raedon Greer as Maggie's perky gal pal Allie. Lukas Ettlin's stark widescreen cinematography provides an appropriately grim and grayish look. David Wingo's moody score does the mournful trick. A quietly potent and heartrending film."

" The exact opposite of Commando
",0.0,-0.9823,2017-05-19 00:00:00,5,"This script is OK at times - and I do give high praise for getting this film made. Look - I have no idea what went into the production of this story, but Maggie could have been an instant classic if they made two simple decisions: fix the incoherent premise and then have an ending where Arnold at least tries to save the day! The rules of this story are that a zombie apocalypse has taken place and if kids are bitten the local government allows their parents to take them home until the transformation happens. When the transformation happens, the parents must bring the kids to the quarantine area to be exterminated. Now - what kind of a government would realistically do this? But, for the sake of zombie-lore and dramatic tension let's say the government does allow this to happen. There is no cure. The kids they get bit. The kid will meet a tragic fate. Everyone is miserable. The end. I understand that the story is about loss and saying goodbye - but there was no conflict going on. Arnold did not try to find a cure. He barely fought to save his daughter. Arnold did not get aggressive. There are streaks of brilliance in the story - such as when Arnold sees a girl zombie and stares at the destruction his own family will soon endure. There is good acting, good cinematography - but the problem with the film is that the character's never change and there is no real conflict that drives the plot forward. Arnold should have fought to save his child - perhaps he falls short - but that is a story audiences can get behind. For a film to be a tragedy a character has to sow the seeds of their own destruction. Without that arc - than the movie is just a downer. Like watching someone get hit by a car. It's sad. But its' not tragic. This movie is sad - but it could have been a tragic masterpiece."
" A Dufferent Kind of Arnold
",0.0,-0.9871,2017-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Freshman director Henry Hobson and ""Terminator"" star Arnold Schwarzenegger have made what qualifies as literally the most interesting but least violent zombie movie in cinematic history. Usually, when you think of a zombie thriller with a star of Schwarzenegger's stature, you imagine lots of blood, gore, and flesh-feasting with Arnie decimating the opposition. Such is not the case with ""Maggie,"" a low-budget but high-minded meditation on zombies from the perspective of a grieving middle-aged father whose daughter has become infected with the Necroambulis Virus Epidemic ravaging the country. The Department of Agriculture warns farmers that they must burn their crops because the crops may be infected with the virus. Refreshing is the adjective that best describes this offbeat, 95-minute, PG-13 rated opus. Essentially, ""Maggie"" deals with an America caught up in zombie apocalypse. Nobody knows exactly how to treat the infected, but they sure don't waste time obliterating those that have turned. Bearded farmer Wade Vogel (Arnold Schwarzenegger) searches for his missing 16-year old daughter, Maggie (Abigail Breslin of ""Zombieland""), and finds her in an urban hospital where she is being treated for an infection. Indeed, a zombie bit her, but the time that it takes for zombie victims to transform into flesh-eater has been changed for dramatic purposes. After he reunites with his daughter, Vogel is allowed to take her home. A doctor warns Wade that he can take his daughter home, but he must take her in for examination if any changes occur. Not long after Wade brings Maggie back home to his wife, Caroline (Joely Richardson of ""Snowden""), so they can spend time with her.One of the problems working against ""Maggie"" is its predictable plot. Wade does everything that he can to shield his daughter from the authorities. If anybody is going to kill her, Wade wants to be the one to delivers the fatal blow. Gradually, Maggie disintegrates. At one point, she chops off a broken finger on a cutting board and throws the digit into the garbage disposal to be ground up. Maggie visits a high school friend who is suffering from an infection. Once humans change, they have to be put in quarantine and a lethal drug must be administered to kill them. Basically, we know that nothing short of a miracle will save Maggie, and ""Maggie"" turns into a tragic film with no relief in sight. Brawny Arnold cannot save his daughter from her fate, but he protects her up to her end. ""Maggie"" shows Arnold Schwarzenegger as we have never seen him. He emerges as a flesh and blood individual who has no power over his daughter's illness and eventual transformation into a zombie. Nevertheless, if zombie movies turn you off because of all their blood and gore, ""Maggie"" may change your mind about this sub-genre."
" Abigail Breslin's on the turn......
",0.0,-0.9928,2017-04-11 00:00:00,2,"During an outbreak of a disease in America's Midwest, a father Wade Vogel (Arnold Schwarzenegger)takes care of his daughter Maggie Vogel (Abigail Breslin) after she has been bitten by one of the infected. The disease slowly turns the infected into cannibalistic zombies and Wade stays by his daughter's side until the inevitable happens...As a rule of thumb, zombie films generally fall along the same sort of narrative lines; you will usually get the living trying to survive against the dead OR the living trying to find a cure for the outbreak (invariably both of these elements are sometimes melded together). However, Maggie is a different beast and is very much less clichéd in its narrative approach to a zombie apocalypse - it has more of a human drama feel to it rather than a race-against-time or a battle against zombies type feel to it. In some ways, this is good as the different angle to a familiar story does at least set it apart from the crowd, but that's really where the praise ends with this film...For a start, the whole story is quite far-fetched and rather hard to believe; we're expected to believe that the authorities would allow the infected to spend their final days with their families putting other non-infected neighbours or families at risk?? Why would this be allowed? Although the infected are effectively supposed to be under house arrest and heavy restrictions are supposedly put on where they can go and what they can do there is never any evidence that this is actually being policed properly?? It's a touching way to set the story up, but it's rather ludicrous and is something that I couldn't buy for one second...Even if you can suspend disbelief for the story then I'll think you'll have a much harder time forgiving the unbelievable tedium that is served up in this film. When I say that nothing happens throughout its 90 odd minute running time I'm not exaggerating - the film slowly shows Maggie getting more and more ill and there is one incident where she nearly gets attacked by the infected and one other occasion when she hangs out with other infected people, but other than these moments there's nothing memorable about this film. Some of the problems lie with the far-fetched script, but director Henry Hobson is also partly to blame for his rather lacklustre and lethargic direction (he seems to use mood music to manipulate the audience into feeling sad rather than achieving this by developing the characters and the story enough to make us give a damn). The only real hook with this film is waiting around to see if Maggie turns, but the film doesn't deliver in this respect either; given the way the story has been set up I didn't expect Maggie to turn on her family (and nor would I have wanted her to as it would have certainly cheapened the film), but still I wish that the film would have had more depth and perhaps explored Maggie's own struggles and her family's struggles trying to deal with her life-changing transformation.Despite the narrative offering a different outlook on coping with a zombie apocalypse, the filmmakers constantly shoot themselves in the foot by giving me a dull story with dull characters where virtually nothing happens and the cherry on the cake here is that there is no dramatic pay-off meaning that the film really is a waste of 90 minutes. It's only a relatively good performance from Abigail Breslin which is preventing the film from getting the minimum score."
" Didn't expect too much! But...
",0.0,0.9932,2017-03-10 00:00:00,7,"OK, to make a long Story short, I actually didn't expect any Thing from this film. It sounded like a really fuc.... B-Movie.... but....No, it is not!!! Arnie Acts in this film like never seen before, yeah, it is quite unusual, but hell yeah, I like that. Of Course, nothing to do here, the film is more quiet and about the relationship between him and the Family, but hell yeah, Arnie managed it real good. I was very impressed seeing him as a loving Father without seeing him killing all the bad guys at once. No, I actually has been very impressed, Arnie Acts like a real father and I saw tears... yes, unbelievable, but it really fits into it This film is like a B-Movie, but I really like the way how it goes and wow, Arnie is great in the role of an old loving Father.Like this very very much! Not to see every night, but I think it is a real good one.Sorry for my English, I'm from Germany! Many Greetings!"
" A Poignant Family Drama
",0.0,0.6277,2017-02-20 00:00:00,8,"You see, the thing about zombies is, they're incredible boring. I'm pretty sure that's why George Romero always chose to marry the ""ghouls"" in his stories with political commentary. I had to learn this lesson myself with my own horror-thriller trilogy. You cannot expect readers to embrace three novels—nearly three hundred thousand words—if all they have to look forward to is a bunch of drooling braineaters on the loose.'Maggie' is not a zombie movie—not in the normal sense. Yes, there are zombies in it —in particular, the title character, played by Abigail Breslin. But these are not the undead we are used to. They are victims of a plague that has swept the planet and has made ordinary people sick—SLOWLY. They may no longer eat, but they can still talk and think and love. They don't shuffle, and neither do they move ultra-fast as in World War Z.' They are simply people who are dying.Against this backdrop you have a father, played beautifully and with quiet strength by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is determined to keep his daughter not only alive, but SAFE for as long as possible. In doing so, he drives away his wife and their two small children, manages to earn the scorn of the police and quite possibly risks his own life. Because when the day comes that Maggie ""turns""—and that day will come—he will be forced to either take her to a quarantine facility, where they will end her life with a death cocktail, or deal with her in his own way at home.If there's one lesson that 'Maggie' teaches us, it's that family and friends matter— especially in times of crisis. This movie didn't have to be about zombies. Wade and his daughter could have ended up exactly in the same situation as a result of worldwide famine, cataclysmic climate change or End Times. It doesn't matter. For me, the poignancy is most present in those quiet moments when Wade and his daughter are sharing a memory or a laugh. It's when he desperately tries to get her to eat something to keep up her strength. And it's when she's starting to turn and he exhorts her to fight and stay human.'Maggie' bombed at the box office. As of this writing (July 2015), it has earned only $187,112 domestic, according to BoxOfficeMojo. And that's a shame. I think perhaps LionsGate may not have known how best to market this film. I sympathize, though. As soon as you say ""zombie"" and Arnold Schwarzenegger, audiences are going to have certain expectations. I wouldn't be surprised if they were thinking guns, brains, and lots and lots of blood. Too bad. This movie is not that.I'm really hoping 'Maggie' does well on video. It deserves an audience—the RIGHT audience."
" Hasta la vista, zombie!
",0.0,0.9683,2017-01-10 00:00:00,6,"Arnold Schwarzenegger and zombies. Can it get any cooler? Yes it can. It can turn out to became the greatest performance of the action giant throughout his decades long career in thoughtful drama concentrated on human relationships and dealing with personal tragedies.Lately I'm not a huge fan of zombie (infection) movie fan, because most of the recent work have had nothing new to add to the genre. Actually neither has 'Maggie', it tries, but fails to put something really fresh on to the table. But it does something the very first time - and that is bringing Arnie and zombies together. And Austrian Oak showed us that he can dig very deep to create an emotional character. And that what we see on the screen - not Arnold, but a character Wade Vogel played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. He and Abigail Breslin (who also turns in amazing performance) has a nice warm chemistry between them. That warmth really shines through the depressive tone of the film.'Maggie' is a grim and gloomy looking character study. It movies slowly and it's rather static. It has limited dialogue and rather lets the quietness and emotions carry the story on. First time director Henry Hobson seems to have this special skill to use silence perfectly. 'Maggie' is not overly entertaining film, it's rather depressing, especially because it's dragging pace, gloomy tones and can be disappointment to some who hope to see Arnie blow away some zombies.'Maggie' is a nice little experiment you should see only because of the little moment of surprise."
