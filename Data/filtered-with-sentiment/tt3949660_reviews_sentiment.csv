" More for kids than adults
",0.0,0.9965,2021-04-01 00:00:00,5,"The Turtles are back in yet another desperate attempt to squeeze every last penny out of fans pockets. The 2014 Turtles movie (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) was an attempt at creating a new Turtles movie franchise but received a lot of criticism upon it's release by both fans and critics. Once details of the sequel were released the film initially looked to be promising with improved CGI, a more faithful story interpretation aswell as adding fan favourite characters like Krang, Casey Jones and Bebop and Rocksteady. Unfortunately what should have been the perfect recipe for a successful Turtles movie turned into just another nostalgic cash grab.One of the main issues I had with the movie is the overabundance of characters. Where the first movie focused mainly on the Turtles and the April O' Neil character as they team up in taking down the Shredder and the Foot clan. Out of the Shadows has the Turtles ""of course"" April, Splinter, Shredder, Baxter Stockman, Casey Jones, Bebop and Rocksteady, Krang and about five other side characters that nobody gives a monkeys about. All these characters are crammed into a two hour movie with each character having little to no character development, backgrounds or even proper introductions. Krang only has around five minutes of screen time most of which is him fighting the Turtles and while the Technodrome is technically in the movie it doesn't actually move or destroy anything making it's inclusion into the movie entirely pointless.The Turtles themselves are slightly less annoying than they were in the first movie but are still just watered down versions of their original personalities. The CGI is slightly better than in the first movie but the Turtles still just look like Pepe the frog in a turtle shell. Krang's design looks pretty decent it's just a shame that he's not in the movie longer enough to tell if he actually has a personality. Bebop and Rocksteady are the only likable character's in the entire movie they first enter the movie in their original human form wearing cheesy costumes while acting like complete idiots. The worst character by far has to be Casey Jones played by (Steven Amell) Amell is a great actor sadly he isn't given a lot to work with playing Casey Jones. Amell got a lot of criticism for his role in the film but it's worth remembering that the Casey Jones character in this movie is nothing like in the original cartoon and Amel did his best with what very little he had to work with.There's definitely a lot more action in this movie than in the original which should have been a good thing but most of the action scene's are just over the top insanity. The Turtles seem to be able to survive anything in this movie from jumping off buildings to jumping out of planes onto another plane head first. The Turtles aren't the only one's who are invulnerable to death every character in the movie even regular innocent humans can survive thing's like a tank shell blowing up the cockpit of a plane they just eject completely unharmed even after the cockpit has exploded around them.This is a Turtles movie made more for the new generation of kids I probably would of have enjoyed this movie a lot more when I was twelve years old. The only adult thing in this movie is Megan Fox who's role in the movie is just to be eye candy for pervy men and teenage boys. There's not much here for adults or old school Turtles fans to enjoy but it's harmless enough for kids who enjoy watching over the top CGI characters fight and make crude fart jokes.The last thing I want to bring up is the movies soundtrack for some reason the producers behind the film wanted to not only ruin my memory of the Turtles franchise but also ruin some classic songs by placing them randomly into the film because yaknow 80s nostalgia just hasn't been miked enough."

" Quite Great, But Cannot Beat The 2014 Film
",0.4012,0.9845,2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,"In my Opinion, while this isn't quite as good as its Predecessor 2014 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the shadows was a great, Action Packed, Hilarious Movie. I Will List the Pros and Cons Of this Film:
1) I like the new Addition to Bebop and Rocksteady aswell as the mighty Krang.
2) April was SO much Better then in the 2014 Film.
3) Michaelangelo Is Definitely That Party Dude, he had some hilarious moments especially the beginning aswell with the pizza. During around the half way point, he's literally eating a mouthful of Pizza.
4) it had some Good MusicNow We have the Pros, let's list the cons of this:
1) Shredder is my Biggest problem of this. He looked less Epic, and he BARELY got Screen Time.
2) They should of used the shell Shocked Theme Again at the credits, still Turtle power is a great theme.
3) Raphael is a Personal Fav Turtle of Me, He was Kinda Dumb, lmao, ""WHAT WOULD VIN DIESAL DO???""
4) all this hype made the 2014 TMNT Film, Epic.Overall, I like this Film, it's a solid Entry to the TMNT Series. BOOYAKASHA!"

If you like ninja turtles, this is for you. Watching the turtles just get to hang out and especially have conflict between one another is what turtles fans live for. It's a serious shame people didn't go see this one just because of how poor the first one was because we might have a really great franshise by now with an extensive ninja turtles world."
" Kinda better than the first film, though by the end it basically levels out as a draw between the two
",0.3832,0.7263,2021-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Kinda better than the first film, though by the end it basically levels out as a draw between the two. Too mundane once more.'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows' does improve a few things, one being the score - not that it's great or anything, but it's more pleasant than Brian Tyler's attempt. Overall it's a little more watchable, but what affects this most is the messy ending - especially with the CGI, which looks like a video game.Cast-wise it's largely the same, though Johnny Knoxville is dropped - not that I noticed until the credits, mind. Can't say I'll remember any of the cast's performances, just like in the 2014 production.I guess it's a positive that this didn't completely crap the bed, as sequels sometimes do - especially ones that follow poor originals. Still, this isn't good at all - and, unsurprisingly, killed the would-be franchise early on."

The acting was horrible, the dialogue was terrible and they turned this into something entirely for children. For the sake of this franchise please don't ever use this director again.

The jokes were very childish so I'm not sure who it's appealing to as it (somehow) got plastered with a 12+ rating, I wouldn't mind a few childish jokes but there were dozens here.Action wise it was alright but very disappointing, without giving too much away the big finale was terrible and ridiculous.3/10: Rubbish"
" Great

This is way better than the 90's version. Much more realistic! I agree maybe a little over the top, but otherwise a great watch with the kids. It's something I can enjoy with my 6 year old. Hoping another comes out so we can see it in the theater someday soon!"

Having Rocksteady and Beebop was a good idea, but I think the CGI is a little cheap (maybe not for 2016, though).I really wish they would make at least one more. Megan Fox was a great pick for this, but I don't know about future movies."
" Great sequel
",0.6249,0.9694,2020-07-16 00:00:00,8,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is a great sequel that actually fixes the flaws with it's predecessor. The Turtles get more screen time and Brian Tee is a much better Shredder, even if he is unfortunately underutilized. Pete Ploszek, Jeremy Howard, Alan Ritchson and Noel Fisher are reliably great as the Turtles. Megan Fox, Will Arnett and Stephen Amell are all really good. Both the CG and Dave Green's direction are great. It's well paced, the music by Steve Jablonsky and the soundtrack are both good."

" It's a miracle this actually got made
",0.5859,0.9908,2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,"This may not be the absolute greatest superhero film ever made (it's not an award-winning, life-changing masterpiece by any means), but I'd be lying if I said it didn't thoroughly entertain me. This is the closest we're ever going to get to having a faithful big-screen adaptation of the more wacky cartoonish Ninja Turtles incarnation from the 1980s, perfectly encapsulating the absurdist tone of the animated series which kickstarted this phenomenal juggernaut off in the first place.I enjoyed the fact it wasn't ashamed to embrace the playful nature of its colourful source material (remember I'm only talking about the TV series here, not the dark and gritty comic books which predate the show), to the point of going all-out with its inclusion of having random bits of silliness and an abundance of pop culture references (it's everything people adored about TMNT from the very start of its immense popularity). And to top it all off, they even managed to include an updated rendition of the original cartoon's theme song in the end credits (so what if it was cheesy? Who cares?!).The Turtles wanting to become human was a plot point I found kind of interesting, with them longing to be accepted into society by the ungrateful surface world of the Big Apple. No wonder they've such pessimistic mindsets (what's the point of protecting people if all they do is fear, judge and hate you?), they constantly risk their own lives to protect the innocent victims of criminal gangs without ever receiving any thanks or recognition of the sort for their selfless acts of heroism towards the oblivious citizens above them.The film overall has a much bigger enthuses on comedically slapstick moments, with a lot of the action scenes feeling more lively and upbeat than they were in some of the previous films, making it in tone with the animated '80s TV show and a vast improvement to view over its slightly duller predecessor. Most of the comedy actually worked pretty well for the most part, although there were a few times when the humour fell flat on its face (mostly the infantile antics).And now, onto some of the more negative aspects; I felt there were way too many betrayals going on, like they were copying Disney's recent ""surprise twist-villain"" trend (first, it's Shredder who backstabs Dr. Stockman. And then, Krang double-crosses Shredder). Also, Megan Fox sucked as April O'Neil! She's just a second-rate model pretending to be a ""real actress"", when in actuality she's a talentless, unenthusiastic woman who constantly looks bored to be on-set (they should've gotten Amy Poehler for the role, at least then Will Arnett could've had some better on-screen chemistry with his co-star). I still prefer the Judith Hoag version of April O'Neil from the older 1990 film, who did the whole acting job 10 times better! I also thought they could've used more time to better develop the third act, as the final battle between the Turtles and Krang on the still-assembling Technodrome felt a tad bit tensionless to me. Speaking of there being no tension, why were they so concerned about getting shot at by the police when their shells were basically bulletproof in the last movie (probably looking too deep into it).But anyway, in spite of all its shortcomings as being far away from a well-crafted ""artsy"" film, the Ninja Turtles franchise as a whole has essentially always been critic-proof (whether they be professionals or amateurs). It's unapologetically goofy for all the right reasons. Take it for what it is."
" Cool film

",-0.4215,0.9724,2020-04-09 00:00:00,4,"This show is a casual watch. Like super causal, like you can watch it over your shoulder as background noise. Its just OK but lacks the chill nature. This movie is over explosive, overacted, over dramatized, and over produced. The original movies can spunk and character. This one feels like it was created to make money and show off CGI. A man in a $5 turtle costume with a good plot and likable characters would be more entertaining."
" Cowabunga!
",0.0,0.993,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"While I did enjoy the first one, I think this is the one we should have gotten the first time. This actually feels (mostly) true to the original source material. Keep in mind, I never watched the cartoons growing up, but knowing some people who did, I'm taking their word for it. Stephen Amell is fantastic as Casey Jones, the new characters Bebop and Rocksteady were fun, the villain Krang was a nice addition, and there were actually some pretty funny jokes. Especially the jabs to some Ninja Turtles merch back in the day, such as a certain Anti-drug PSA. (Although there are some really outdated pop culture references from Mikey. ""Say hello to my little friend"" just isn't funny anymore. It's become tired and cliche. Let it die.) Some issues I had with the film were the character of Baxter Stockman (Tyler Perry). His performance is cringeworthy and unfunny. Although he is an important character, I wanted his scenes to be over as quickly as possible. They could have cast anyone else and they chose Tyler Perry of all people?! What were they thinking?! I wish Will Arnett's character was in the film more, because he was the best part of the first one, and I was looking forward to witty banter between Arnett and Amell, but sadly, we didn't get any. There was so much untapped potential for comedy with these two and they wasted it (on Tyler Perry. Again, why?!) The story felt very classic Ninja Turtles and this movie is definitely a hidden gem, despite what Rotten Tomatoes would have you believe.Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"

" Worst writing I've ever seen in a motion picture. Makes Origins Wolverine look like Mark Twain
",-0.3818,0.1626,2019-07-18 00:00:00,1,"This has honestly some of the most nostalgia-bait character insertions, laziest plotting and the most ear-splittingly bad lines I've ever heard... seriously every time someone said something I literally said to myself ""Wow that's the line they went with?"" You know they were probably deciding between 5 or 6 different options for each one of these lines and they somehow went with the worst possible jokes and takes of said jokes that they could... Beebop and Rocksteady throwing out dick jokes in the middle of this thing just completely ruins any chance that this thing had of having a half decent tone... but let's talk about the plotting, and one scene in particular stands out in my mind which is the scene where Krang and Shredder meet... the way Shredder got there is nonsensical enough but then the scene is literally this: ""Hey Shredder. I'm Krang. Let's team up and defeat the Turtles. We need this this and this MacGuffin"" ""Okay sure!"" Like I'm only slightly paraphrasing here... Krang has almost zero introduction and I'm pretty sure a small child could have written something more interesting... these 'filmmakers' should be ashamed of themselves"
" my notes
",0.0,-0.9912,2019-06-30 00:00:00,4,"Going into this movie expecting it to be pretty stupid, i kind of enjoyed a lot of it. and there was good nostalgia from my childhood memories. but as a movie this is pretty awful. you could make fun of soooooo many things. this rating really should be even lower. there were so many times the movie did something that doesn't make sense but were presumably assuming a dumb audience wouldn't notice or care. but it was funny and had some cool scenes and a good musical score. i just wish some of the action was done a little better. the turtle CGI looked bad at times. a bunch of scenes were 100% CGI, even the surroundings, and it sometimes looked like a CGI barf fest of chaos. hard to get invested in an action scene like that. and there were a lot of lame, typical cliches and stealing from other movies. some parts were so bafflingly dumb and unbelievably childish. (2 viewings)

they didn't have any good fight scenes. they barely fought bebop and rocksteady. and it was so lame that there was no fight from shredder. he was the main villain the whole movie but then just disappeared. krang also looked and sounded really stupid and awful. and splinter is still ugly."

" Not mind-blowing, but VASTLY superior to the first film.
",0.6956,0.9984,2019-03-31 00:00:00,7,"After the quite frankly awful 2014 reboot of the Turtles films which changed far too much about the history of the origins and was stunted by a thin plot, it was surprising when a sequel was announced.Thankfully, this second film in the series seems to be on a much better track. Make no mistake, this is a million times better than the trash we got in the first film. The pacing is better, the plot is more believable, and the whole film just looks and feels better.The movie also takes far more of an influence from the cartoon, but in a good way. Lots of features and characters have been includes and it's great to see the likes of Bebop, Rocksteady and of course Krang. The action is decent and it's all very enjoyable.That being said I wouldn't say it's a good film as some parts are still paper thin. Shredder doesn't seem to have either much of a motive or a backstory, and it's unclear as to if this is even the same guy from the first film as they look totally different. Krang is great when he's on screen, but that's only for about 5 minutes tops in the whole film. It's somewhat of a waste becasue he's done quite well, although his motivations are even thinner than Shredder's and he just seems to be causing bother for the hell of it.The biggest positive about the movie is without a doubt the Turtles themselves. They are brilliantly characterised and well animated too, with each one of them having a very unique look and personality. No complaints here.The film can't get away from some bad casting choices though. Steven Amell is terrible as Casey Jones. He's FAR too clean cut and too much of a pretty boy to be in this role, and he ends up just being the most generic character you could imagine. Even worse is that they changed his backstory from being a vigilante to being a cop.The film's biggest let down is one of its strengths too. There is a great theme of isolation and not being accepted running throughout, and it's touched apon in several scenes which makes for really good viewing. However it's not explored to anywhere near its full potential, and I could have quite liked to have seen one of the Turtles become human...at least for a bit.As previously stated this isn't really a great film, but it is an entertaining one. While the first movie just felt off for the entire run time, this sequel hits the mark pretty satisfactorily throughout, but is never actually strong enough to ring the bell at the top of the pole.It's sad becasue the Turtles in this film seem like great characters in average movies. If given a chance it could really be something, but with the greasy hand of Michael Bay continually molesting the production I don't think that they will be allowed to shine in a film that is worthy of their amazing character designs.If I had my way I'd get Steve Barron (the director of the 1990 film) back to do the third movie, because to date he's done the best and most mature cinematic interpretation of the IP that has ever been, not to mention making it the most successful indie film of all time. That may be wishful thinking though.""TMNT: Out of the Shadows"" has its many flaws, but it also has far more good points than that abortion of a first film. I can heartily recommend it if you are looking for a good time."

Character development is thrown out the window, with Bay thinking out loud ""do you know what kids love to see? Explosions. Mind-numbing action. See, look at my 'Transformers' franchise. Everybody loves it!"". I will say that this is neither better or worse than its predecessor. Take that as you will. After saving New York City, the turtles remain in the sewers taking no credit for their heroic deeds. Shredder escapes and meets an inter-dimensional warlord, resulting in the turtles having to save the day without anyone knowing...again. So, improvements. The action was much grander, with the inclusion of various set pieces, and is filmed decently by Green. The editing was proficient although occasionally succumbs to excessive quick cuts, especially during hand-to-hand combat with Bebop and Rocksteady (who are welcome additions). The cartoonish antics seemingly felt right, particularly from the turtles. Green settles on a mindless tone which makes for several humorous moments that younger audiences will appreciate. Fox wasn't the worst actor either (never said that before...). No, that title is awarded to Amell who was insufferably irritating. ""I'm gonna be a detective!"". Yeah ok, tell us all of your future plans and life stories within the first minute of screen time. Go ahead! Perry was channelling his inner pantomime. Linney's talents were wasted (why Laura, why!?). And Karai as a character was utterly non-existent. This all stems down to the screenplay, and it was hideous. No wit. No sincere dialogue. Just plain stupidity. There was a moment when the turtles discuss the feeling of acceptance and how they wish to be human. An investing perspective that attempts to endeavour into segregation, but that's quickly diminished by Michelangelo's excessive foolish behaviour. Many eye rolling moments were had. Krang was underdeveloped and Shredder lost all his menace. Story-wise an absolute mess, but much better technically."

But not story wise when your a TMNT fan since a kid.The same mistake is carried forward in this film as well. Only thing that keeps us in the film is the characters introduced.Bepop and Rocksteady looked good. But the characters sucked.Now this is the biggest flaw in the modern TMNT (2014 - ...) franchise.

" Michael Bay: ruining my childhood, one film at a time
",-0.25,-0.9953,2018-09-30 00:00:00,1,"I didn't think things could get worse than the first of these movies. But as is the case more often than not, the sequel is usually less good and more shameless than its predecessor.While this movie is not directed by Michael Bay, it has the stink of the producer's signature all over it: a non-stop series of shiny CGI distractions, one after another, all froth and no substance, trying in vain to hold up (or perhaps cover up) an incoherent B-movie script, and containing a veritable Who's Who of too-good-looking, infamously bad actors: the always atrocious Megan Fox (a Michael Bay staple), chiseled but emotionally hollow Stephen Amell, walking cartoon and WWE wrestler Seamus, one-note Dean Winters (the Allstate ""Mayhem"" guy), and hammy overactor Tyler Perry the most notable. It's as if the CW was handed an action-movie budget. Will Arnett, while a better actor overall than the others mentioned, is terribly one-dimensional as Vern ""The Falcon"" Fenwick, a nickname that is spit-take worthy in its Jump-the-Shark corniness. It's no surprise that at least three of the principal actors from the first film didn't reprise their roles (even sadder is the fact that most people won't notice those changes). In the film's most head-scratching casting decision, the usually brilliant Laura Linney is incapable of elevating the horrible writing she's handed. One can hope she got paid enough to justify attaching herself to this project.While the Shredder was over CGI'd and too high-concept to be believable in the first film, here they choose to strip him down to just the human underneath, in which they also failed, as the re-cast actor not only looks nothing like the previous film's character, but is simply too normal-looking overall. Again, just casting a handsome buff dude is not the answer! Under the ridiculous blade armor, the heavily scarred bald Shredder from the first film - the only thing they got close to right in that installment - was replaced by a handsome younger man with a full head of hair and beard who looks far too normal and too handsome to be intimidating; additionally, the two or three light scratches on his face look as if they belong on a man training a new pet cat, not the monstrous, battle-scarred sociopath intent on world domination we saw in the previous film. The fact that Shredder operates without his (suddenly understated) armor for most of the film is one of the filmmakers more obvious errors in judgment.Questionable casting and uninspired kids show acting aside, the film regularly chooses to ignore the laws of physics in favor of making the overly CGI'd Turtles perform mind-bending stunts with no basis in reality. Apparently in Michael Bay Land, as long as it's bright, shiny, mostly CGI, and the camera constantly moves so fast that the viewer can't absorb what they're seeing, it makes up for the action being so unbelievable that you leave the audience yawning from action-fatigue. Whether it's free-falling 3000 feet from one in-flight cargo plane to another (able to stand on said plane and talk to each other after landing on it, despite traveling at 500+mph) or repelling down the sides of NYC skyscrapers with relative ease into a (covered) manhole, then playing frisbee with a boxed pizza at breakneck speed through large yet cluttered sewers, all while suffering no ill effects, bruises, or smushed pizza, the action of the piece is so gaudy and unrealistic, it stretches the viewer's suspension of disbelief to unreasonable levels.More offensive than anything else in the film is the writing. I can't tell who they were writing it for; was their target audience children, or adults who grew up with the comics and animated series? It seems written simply enough - with clunky and over-simplified dialogue - to keep the former from getting lost, yet displays a frat-boy crudeness to appease the latter. It fails to do either, while also failing to even capture person-to-person dialogue in ways that people actually talk. Perhaps, in traditional Michael Bay fashion, the script was originally just a series of action sequences, and the ham-fisted dialogue was crudely and haphazard thrown together later as way of tying those action sequences together. It's the only explanation for why they would think this let-me-explain-what-we're-doing-as-we-do-it, faux inspirational, B-movie superhero monologue format would somehow come together and form a coherent script. When Linney says to Amell, ""you're an even bigger loser than I thought,"" one is forced to cringe (though no more than when Bebop and Rocksteady clumsily introduce themselves multiple times as if on their first day of kindergarten). This quality of writing is expected in, if not eclipsed by, any number of no-budget student films.Finally, the inclusion of Krang, the talking brain who commands Shredder and the Foot in the cartoon, was what finally pushed things over the edge for this viewer. Voiced by Brad Garrett (some bizarre acting choices made in his performance to say the least), this character coming from Dimension X to take over the world felt incomplete in its explanation, and force-fed in its implementation. Not to mention that I feel like I've seen this ""coming through a wormhole to take over New York"" plot device in (at least) one Marvel movie already, so any potential excitement brought on by the film's climax felt like a rerun. As a fan of the cartoon that introduced Krang, Bebop, and Rocksteady, I felt like the filmmakers forced these corny cartoon characters into a live action film, never truly deciding which kind of movie they were making.Overall, this movie is nigh unwatchable. Between trying to shoehorn in outlandish characters from the comic and 1987 cartoon, attempting to use pretty people in place of skilled actors to tell their story, and spending little to no effort in making dialogue and story coherent or believable, the filmmakers fall flat on their faces. Over and over and over again."

",0.0,-0.4791,2018-08-20 00:00:00,3,"A sequel from the ultra flawed attempt to revive the franchise, full of Michael Bay vices (overdone action secuences, bad dialogue, worse jokes, simplistic characters, unoriginal story, boring, etc.). Without changing the core of the problems (the awful turtles' designs and characterizations), it was hard to believe a better sequel was going to be created. Megan Fox is still the one leading the story in many ways, so. Flawed indeed.The rythm is slightly better, probably because it's not an origin story. There is one big sequence (15') that is really good with actually funny jokes. So bad the movie is one hour and a half longer. Will Arnett helps to make Megan Fox look better in some short scenes here and there. Fan service with the villains. Little else.The story is a bit more coherent, but too generic to matter. The characters have no arcs (or empty ones) and the turtles dynamic better, but still weak.
Anyway. The director is ""Dave Green"", but we all know that good or bad (in this case, bad), is all on Bay's shoulders.A missed oportunity of a franchise revival."

" I should have hated this film more
",-0.6369,0.9942,2018-08-06 00:00:00,6,"I was the original eighties kid who grew up on the Teenage Mutant Ninja (or 'Hero' as it was here in the UK) Turtles cartoon. Then the inevitable live action film was released in 1990 and, despite how bad it really was, I loved it. I stress again - I was a kid. 'Out of the Shadows' is the second instalment of the modern generation of Turtles films and I remember the outcry from us fanboys when the first one was released. Okay, so we had a point about the possibility of the turtles being evolved from aliens, but, overall, it was just how it wasn't representative of what we remembered. And we collectively hated it.Yeah, it was no masterpiece and there were definitely things in it I'd like to have seen, but didn't. But it wasn't terrible. And, bearing that in mind, I decided to watch its follow-up. And, unbelievably, I'm actually quite glad I did. No, I didn't love it - it wasn't really the Turtles that I remembered from my childhood, but suddenly I could see kids today absolutely loving it. In twenty or thirty years' time I can see them arguing with their own children about how whatever new 'update' to the franchise doesn't compare to Megan Fox's portrayal of April O'Neil. And they'll be right. And so will their kids.I could bang on about how there was too much CGI, or that the Turtles themselves looked hideous and scary compared to their loveable cartoon incarnations. Plus the film felt like just another addition to Michael Bay's ever-growing list of blockbusters with more explosions than narrative structure. Then there were the complete gaps in logic where you have to suspend your disbelief in order to get past the fact that, in this post 9/11 world, it's quite feasible to break into a New York police station as long as you have a baseball cap and a toolbox (and I guess looking like Megan Fox helps). Yes, it's fair to say that 'Out of the Shadows' is ripe for ripping apart. And yet it was actually still quite fun.I do hate the overuse of computer effects, but, if you're making a live action story about six foot turtles interacting with humans, what else are you supposed to do? Maybe it was because the cartoon was just so, er, cartoonish, that I enjoyed seeing a mutant pig and rhino - almost literally - butting heads with our pizza-loving heroes, plus there was Krang. And, if you don't know he's a kind of pink living brain who lives in the stomach of a robot in another dimension. He was a true joy to watch. My major criticism of him was that he wasn't in it for long enough and had to share stage with (the more obvious baddie) Shredder, who - again - had very little time to develop his character and only popped up here and there to look moody and evil.After watching the first (recent - 2014) incarnation of the turtles, I can only really remember an end battle on a rooftop. Whereas with 'Out of the Shadows' I can actually recall quite a lot of detail regarding the plot. Okay, so there wasn't much of a plot. Maybe I should state that I can remember quite a lot about the action sequences and pretty visuals, plus the banter between the four turtles was amusing enough to keep me entertained. And this is pure entertainment. Don't expect anything else. Just appreciate that boys today will probably love this film in the same way we loved the cartoon back in the late eighties (and we didn't even have Megan Fox at the helm!). I may even watch this one again one day. And it's definitely better than any of the recent Michael Bay 'Transformers' movies!"

" EXCELLENT TMNT MOVIE FOR THE FANS!!! BEST FILM AFTER THE CLASSIC 1990 FLICK.
",0.9051,0.9998,2018-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Hated the first reboot movie it was a complete mess & totally Crap. OUT OF THE SHADOWS was EXCELLENT!!! a throw back fun-filled adventure for fans who grew up with the animated series & the old 90s movies like me. The turtles look AWESOME i REALLY like the new look of each character, they look great & gritty & real, splinter looks amazing i just don't like his voice as he should be Japanese!!! But anyway the BRILLIANT turtle van shows up & it's BEAUTIFUL, just mind blowing!!! Beebop & Rocksteady show up & look AMAZING!!! CASEY JONES is abit of a let down, ACTUALLY a big let down but was ok & grew on me by the end of the movie but he was still wrongly cast & KRAANG!!! OMG he was PERFECT, GROSS & SLIMEY. This is almost a great TMNT MOVIE but there is some bad bits!!!
There's a nice feel of childhood Nostalgia with this movie & IT'S fast paced action fun like the animated series!!!
The has one of the best opening scenes in movies in my opinion with the exciting & heroic theme playing while our 4 heroe's slide down a big building, it's an epic sequence in my opinion!!!
""Out of the Shadows"" came out in the Awesome summer of 2016, a great time for 3 of the best & most underrated films of that year with Suicide Squad, Ghostbusters & Tmnt, i loved all 3 films for different reasons. The ""Female"" Ghostbusters was excellent in my opinion & i loved Will Smith as Deadshot in the Awesome Suicide Squad & of course ""Out of the Shadows"" also had a big impact on me.
The Ghostbusters reboot got a 9/10 & would've got a full 10/10 but my only complaint was it didn't exist in the same universe as the first two Classic films & the extremely Awesome Suicide Squad also got a 9/10 & here my green mutant heroes also got a great 9/10, because it did have some bad bits but overall i loved all 3 extremely underrated big budget fun popcorn movies.The look is visually stunning & striking & beautiful at times especially in the Turtles sewer base scenes, the cinematography is gorgeous with a colourful vibrant look & the production design is outstanding with so much attention to detail, the studio filmmakers really worked hard to craft a ""TMNT"" movie that both new generation kids & old school fans can enjoy & they did it excellently, this is big expensive fun!!!
Another outstanding sequence is the turtles van scene with the Shredder transportation escape on the road, speeding at night & it's such an exciting & epic piece of action, the tmnt van is beautiful & i was like a kid again with a huge smile. I loved the feelgood big budget feel of this movie & is definitely the 2nd best after the 1990 Classic.The main huge problem is the worst actress in cinema history megan fox, she's terrible & only in movies because she's extremely pretty but she can't act at all & she's a horrendous April O'neil & like i said Casey Jones was ruined in this film he may as well of been a new character that teams up with the turtles as his character is NOTHING like the proper Casey Jones.The fun spirit of the animated series in here but still with the more darker tone here & there when things get dangerous but the main thing is this film is so entertaining, a big budget blockbuster for Turtle fans.The action is big blockbuster action fun & all the fx are outstanding & has lots of fun & humorous scenes, THIS wipes the floor with the crap first 2014 film!!! This is a modern kick ass TMNT movie for old school fans i love it even though it's not a perfect TMNT film there's still well enough great stuff in here to love!!!
Out of the Shadows is the best TMNT film after the first film. Out of the Shadows was So much fun & to me was like ""The Dark Knight"" of the tmnt franchise.
Always loved the turtles since little & fell in love with them all over again thanks to this incredible new vision of them.
A movie that is simply a big piece of expensive entertainment but made with real heart behind it.
GREAT FUN, SO ENJOYABLE & GREAT ADVENTURE."

This is much of a muchness with the first film in the series, with incessant CGI action throughout and the dumbest kind of humour imaginable. The good characters run around a lot and act heroically, while the bad characters chew and spit their dialogue and every human in the cast gives way to yet more big CGI effects. The only thing I liked about this film is the inclusion of some old favourite characters of mine that were also in the cartoon TV show of the 1980s, but they end up being just as generic as everyone else. What a pity that a film with this much money and this many resources behind it can be so bland."

Maybe teenagers are just more immature than I remember, it's cringe worthy like watching children's TV presenters. But it is based on a cartoon after all, plus the CGI is decent hens 5 stars, maybe something to put on in the background while you're on your phone... which is exactly how teens will watch it!

" They did much more *right* with this one!
",0.0,0.9915,2018-02-11 00:00:00,8,"I don't know why I feel compelled to write a review here but I just watched the movie this morning and was pleasantly surprised several times.I was a child not only for the original cartoon, but for the even earlier comic book series. I was too young for the comics - they were more gritty, a slightly darker and more adult version of what we got with the cartoon; I got into those later actually. But I mention the comic books specifically to point out something this movie did right: Baxter Stockman. Tyler Perry looked exactly as I remembered Baxter from the 1984 comics, a far cry from the wacky white guy we got in the 1987 cartoon. (Apparently they course-corrected this in the early-00s cartoon, too.) But the cartoon was a huge tour de force and this movie honored THAT source material as well. Bebop, Rocksteady, Krang, the Technodrome (more or less), the Party Wagon (giant nunchaku notwithstanding)... This is the kind of thing I had expected from the first Bay outing, rather than the weird Amazing Spider-Man rehash we got in TMNT.Imagine that. Bay and his team actually doing right by the source material. Why couldn't we get even half that level of consideration in Transformers?Note: this ""sequel does it better"" thing also happened with GIJoe - where the backlash from the first movie yields some actual improvements to the second.Is it a GOOD movie? Not really. Is it a FUN movie? Sure. it's way more chop-socky proportionally than the first, spending a little less time on character melodrama, but of course there is still some of that. I was super sick of the turtles' constant infighting and Mikey being a /complete/ doofus by about halfway in. The following may be a spoiler to some people?
Of course, the plot was still reminiscent of other things because of course it was. Man, NYC has to have just started ignoring giant battles and aliens in the sky by now since it happens every year or two."
" It were actually the Turtles
",0.0,0.9863,2018-01-30 00:00:00,7,"Now usually I don't like the remaking movies from old shows they all make me a little sad, the new MacGyver and Lethal Weapon series made me sick, 21 and 22 Jump Street, Miami Vice, Starsky and Hutch the Dukes of Hazard,... cartoons like Transformers and GIJoe all just bad, nothing like the series that made them big. But since my injury had be bench bound I had a lot of time, so I pushed play on this the first one was okayish but this one really surprised me well. As I watched I really had some nostalgic feelings, like the cartoons I loved and blended with some newer elements. The difference in the Turtles is good but they are who they are, even though M. Fox is not the best choice for acting but the looks are actually good enough, S. Ammells was a good Casey Jones... though would have liked a more roughed up look with semi long hair. Shredder, Krang even though his voice was meh were the characters they were supossed to be, just like Bebop and Rocksteady ok Stockman didn't use to be black but we live in a time where that is needed. So let him have it, the guy playing Vern was just like him.Story was decent enough with the Shredder escaping and thanks to him Bebop and Rocksteady, Shredder being recruted by Krang to bring the Technodrome to Earth, which was a nice spot on with the cartoon as well... Then letting Stockman transforming Bebop and Rocksteady as we know em. They are a little smarter in the movie, but thats no loss, Finding some pieces thoughout places and creating the portal to bring in the Technodrome, a final battle between the Turles and Krang and the happy ending.There were some Bay goofs againg going to Bumblebee being the main point, but this one was way better then the Power Rangers stupidity.
There were some weak jokes, and the CGI was sometimes to much of it.
But all in all I really had a good time watching this, and probably will watch it again.Final closing moment is though if Tirtles could do it why didn't GIJOE and the Transformers have the same satisfying felling at the end. I never liked the complete parts of the Transformers, the cars are their disguise. So why can't the Bots look more like the same... only to show off your CGI stuff.
And GIJOE had just a more army felling than a special force, and their team was to small in both movies to give you the GIJOE feeling."

This movie actually has a better story line then the previous and it is even more funnier. Like when Bebop and Rocksteady get transformed and when Bebop says to Rocksteady ""You are a rhino (looks in the mirror) and i am a little piggy"" The moments with these two characters were hilarious.The acting was decent again in this film Megan Fox was hot as April in this movie and considering I am not really a fan of the CW Arrow tv series Stephen Amell was pretty good as Casey Jones in this movie.

" The right kind of silly
",-0.0498,0.714,2017-11-01 00:00:00,7,"The 1st film in this new reboot was one of the worst train wreck of a movie I've seen in a long time. I ranked it 6 but it was bordering on 5, and all of these were mostly for the technical aspects of the movie. The plot didn't deserve more than 2. So sometimes script writers can learn from their own mistakes. The same couple responsible for the previous train wreck got promoted into writers/executive producers, and showed they can do it better. They took out the horrible pompousness, they went back to the source material and made this version way funnier, with the same anarchistic humor that was there all through the cartoon series. They even got a decent couple to play Bebop and Rocksteady Stephen Farrelly and Gary Anthony Williams, and they also brought in Stephen Amell, who does a decent rendition of Casey Jones, with more character depth than Casey ever had before.Don't take it the wrong way, it's still a silly story, but this one is the right kind of silly. It's funny, it's professionally done, and even the few pseudo serious moments about the difficulties of the turtles to perform as a team, are too few to damage the overall effect. This one is a 7 but it's a borderline 8, and the improvement is a real surprise that deserves credit for its own sake."
" Lot of Fun but The Turtles Have It Too Easy

And Donatello, the computer whiz of the lot, got a solution or a device for just about everything, even if it doesn't make sense how he accomplishes it. We have the same actors from the prequel, Megan Fox & Will Arnett but here they are like secondary characters in almost forgettable roles. Police officer Casey Johns, well essayed by Stephen Amell, gets a better role compared to the rest. The turtles are still an adorable lot and I think there's lot more humor in this movie but I looked forward to more kicks, hand chops or sword play from these guys like in the prequel. Anyway the movie is still watchable and an entertainment, also ably supported by other actors who don their characters well like Shredder(Brian Tee), nutty scientist Baxter(Tyler Perry), no-nonsense police chief Vincent(Laura Linney) or the sidekick villains Rocksteady(WWE wrestler Sheamus) & Bebop(Gary Williams). Verdict - miss the intensity & suspense of the 2014 movie but this is still a time pass, clean & fun entertainer."
" Legitimately Awful
",-0.4588,0.9605,2017-10-15 00:00:00,2,"I'll preface by saying that I've seen the first four Transformers movies and the first one of these as well. I've watched a fair amount of Michael Bay in my time. This is a spectacular level of awful even by Bay standards. The Turtle personas are horribly underdeveloped, and their looks have not improved from the first film either. The dialogue is plodding and in dire need of editing, and none of the secondary characters contributes anything of real note.As with Transformers, the humans are more of the story than they should be. The CGI characters are why the movie is being made, and they don't get nearly enough time to justify the expense of creating them. Don't get me wrong, it's spectacular to see Bebop and Rocksteady, and the design works, but there's a lot left on the table.This wouldn't be so bad if they were interesting. Stephen Amell, who is familiar with the vigilante role, who lauded the script on his Facebook, is underutilized to the point of being a waste. Casey Jones was a great part of the original TMNT film in 1990, played by Elias Koteas as a layered character with a great sense of humor that bonds with the Turtles. Amell's version doesn't get to that level, and it's unfortunate.Megan Fox continues to do what she does best; look pretty and be shocked by things, but April O'Neil is a missed mark yet again, and Tyler Perry doesn't quite nail the mad scientist motif necessary for Baxter. An evil laugh would have done wonders for him.And then there's Krang. Krang looks about as right as possible for a CGI version of a disembodied brain, but he is far removed from his original characterization. He isn't diabolical, he's a brain-shaped bully.As such, just like with Transformers, Bay's team misses out on some great characters and settings, creates CGI issues and failed plot lines, and the whole thing falls flat as a result."

I'd say it's good for children down to kindergarten, but there was too much violence and gun-play to recommend for those that young.So teenagers and up avoid this one (and the original...same target audience). As an adult your only hope must be that your kid, nephew or niece likes it because besides a few oldies songs there is nothing there for you."

" A Load of New TMNT Character Intros (Isn't Enough to Save This Movie)
",-0.3875,0.9966,2017-09-11 00:00:00,5,"Do you realize that, when the second installment in the freshly rebooted TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES franchise was released in 2016, we officially had almost as many big screen adventures for the amphibious ninja brothers as such characters as Superman, Spider-Man, and Batman? That's ridiculous and not because there are so many; people love the characters. What's ridiculous is we've come so far and only have one Ninja Turtle film that I would qualify as really good (the original from 1990) and one I am physically unable to hate, purely for nostalgia (the second from 1991). All of the others have been forgettable at best (the animated film from 2007) or outright painful to sit through at worst (that time travel abomination from 1993). The release of TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES in 2014 from Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes attempted to bring the turtles into a more modern world with the same visual style that made Bay's own TRANSFORMERS movies a success. The turtles, while retaining their teenage sensibilities, are now hulking monsters. Megan Fox was cast as April O'Neil and the character became a sex symbol for Michelangelo to bombard with pickup lines, and the Shredder suddenly relied less on his martial arts skills and more on his new mech armor that was capable of launching enormous blades and retracting them on chains. It was a strange misstep that, though it had elements of the spirit of the characters I grew up with, most of it just didn't feel right.I'd had my fill of the new Turtles with that 2014 film and I was ready to write off the new one without a second glance until it was revealed that the production was going to start integrating more elements from the cartoon series I had obsessed over as a child. The same nostalgia that won't let me hate SECRET OF THE OOZE, despite the fact that the characters weren't even allowed to use their weapons in that movie, demanded that I watch OUT OF THE SHADOWS. We're talking the first big screen appearances for Rocksteady and Bebop, Baxter Stockman, and Krang with his Technodrome. So I had to convince myself that maybe, just maybe, the new NINJA TURTLES might be getting the series on track. So I watched it and I quickly remembered, ""Oh yeah. These movies are for kids."" Sure, the movie features a scene where Megan Fox's April O'Neil dons a school girl uniform to distract a target but this movie is for kids. Young kids. Everything I was excited to see in this movie was just dumb. Rocksteady and Bebop are no more threatening than the infantile Tokka and Rahzar from THE SECRET OF THE OOZE but they're more difficult to stomach as they're chowing down on ten-gallon drums of spaghetti or constantly stomach-bumping each other with a chant of ""My man!"" And before you ask, of course the spaghetti scene includes a moment where one of them interrupts a briefing to slurp an unwieldy noodle.I understand that these movies are meant for younger crowds, and I'm cool with that, but do they have to be so dumb? Kids are smarter than studios give them credit for and I don't think it'd hurt to put a little more effort into these movies. I'm willing to forgive the occasional cheesy joke and glaring plot issue, but let's try a little harder to make something that actually entertains. Rocksteady and Bebop were far from geniuses in the show but they weren't obnoxious, and Splinter works better when he's isn't just a punchline. The Splinter I remember was stoic, intelligent, and most importantly the father figure for these teenaged ninja outcasts. Now he's just in the movies to help shill for whatever pizza chain is helping to foot the bill for the film's animation. One quick note on that matter, the Turtles shouldn't be eating Papa John's or Dominoes or whatever. Let them eat some genuine New York pizza. New York was always a character in the world of the Ninja Turtles and it breaks my heart to see them eating mass-produced chain food. What else? Well, the plot of the movie is pretty uninspired. The Turtles are racing against Shredder and his new mutant cohorts to acquire parts to an inter-dimensional portal that the baddies hope to use to bring Krang into our world. Also Krang looks less like a brain and more like a wad of chewed bubble gum, and Brad Garrett's voice acting doesn't work for me. Fred Armisen had originally been cast to voice Krang and I can't help but think of how much better it could've been. Stephen Amell, from TV's ""Arrow"", and Tyler Perry round out the cast as Casey Jones and Baxter Stockman, respectively. Amell brings nothing new to the table but I was charmed by Perry's neurotic enthusiasm as Stockman and hope, if we do end up with another one of these movies, he returns to live out his character's destiny with a mutation into an anthropomorphic fly.OUT OF THE SHADOWS makes a lot of big promises but fails to make any of its new material very interesting. There has to be a way for these movies to be entertaining without neglecting their target audience. They should check out what the Nickelodeon Ninja Turtle series was doing; it proves these characters can work for all ages. For now though, the Platinum Dunes NINJA TURTLE franchise continues to disappoint and bore, and no amount of nostalgia for these characters will make me want to revisit this in the future."

" Rating: D
",0.0,-0.3161,2017-08-06 00:00:00,3,"I'm going to say it straight away: this sequel is even worse than the first movie (what a surprise ... a bad sequel to a bad movie). If you're interested in the ""Ninja"" part of the title, then you're going to be disappointed because there's almost no ninja action from the turtles. They do parkour, they jump out of planes, but very rarely they actually fight. However, if there's an improvement to the last movie it's the turtles. They're funnier, more likable and you feel their connection as brothers and as a team. It's a shame that the director thought would be more important to show Megan Fox (April O'Neil) in a tight shirt than to explore the turtles' relationship.Moving on to the cast, Stephen Amell plays Casey Jones and he's actually a nice actor, but he's really awful in this movie, mostly because of the character itself. He just shows up here and there, he doesn't help that much and he so happens to like April O'Neil, who also doesn't do much, except for using her phone to call everyone. Krang (Brad Garrett) is a terrible annoying villain, he's just a CGI chewing gum with tentacles connected to a robot that speaks with the most irritating voice ever ... How could that not suck?! A lot of people complained about Shredder (Brian Tee) being a robot in the first film, so the director made him a human, but not without giving us another reason to be mad. No spoilers, but he does nothing. LITERALLY, he does nothing! He doesn't talk, he doesn't fight ... Sorry, but he has no role in this movie whatsoever.Saving the worst for last, if I wanted to sum up this film in one word it would be: exposition. 99% of this movie is an exposition scene! In case you don't know what that is, it's when the director shows us a scene where a character or a narrator literally explains to us (the audience), through a dialogue between characters or a narration, something we need to know to understand part of the plot or a backstory that will be important in the future. Usually, this happens when there's a hard time involved with telling something without literally saying it like ""Hey, you need to know this so here it goes ..."". David Green treats us like we're the dumbest people alive! This movie has scenes and scenes and scenes where we know what's going to happen next because it's obvious, but there's always a character saying it out loud. Megan Fox spends the movie calling the turtles telling things they need to know and then the turtles repeat that so that we didn't miss it. It's like this the whole movie, I just wanted to shout ""I already know thaaaat!"".Even if you're a hardcore fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles growing up, I don't think that the fan-service's scenes will be enough for you to consider this a watchable movie...MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" The movie was the best movie that I've ever seen
",0.6369,0.913,2017-07-13 00:00:00,10,The movie is about the turtles that they are ninjas actually they are enemy of shredder (A bad guy who always ruin the city and no body can defeat them even the police but Turtles try hard as much as they can they try to help the city without any award. The guy in the movie who is a hockey player just was a normal police but when he saw the ninja turtles he became a useful person for the city by helping the turtles ninjas. In this story turtles has some problem but they solved it. This movie was the best movie that I've ever seen in my life and the best sentences in this movie was 'Who are these guys!' buy an strange voice from the hockey player. I recommend you to see this movie at least one time because I have seen this movie for 5 times.
" The movie does not fulfill it's basic promise.
",-0.0274,0.7809,2017-07-06 00:00:00,5,"The trailer teases Bebop and Rocksteady, Shredder, Krang, and the return of the Technodrome. Also, Casey Jones. If all the characters of the original cartoon are back, we expect something of the original story dynamics, too. Krang is supposed to come up with some evil plan, which either Shredder (out of ambition) or Bebop/Rocksteady (out of stupidity) will screw up. Either Krang or Shredder will blow a fuse, hilarity ensues. On the good guy team, Casey or April will provide info or help out, maybe get into trouble, and the Turtles will deal with whatever new crazy threat Krang &co have brought down on the city.Instead .. how can I put this? The plot of the movie is just a series of events. That happens, then this happens, then this other thing happens. There's precious few dynamic character interactions that could make the story interesting: ""this character does this, so this character gets angry and does this, which causes the other characters to change their plans, which the consequence that.."" The movie has a bad case of origin story disease. We don't want to see how Bebop and Rocksteady became Bebop and Rocksteady. We want to see Bebop and Rocksteady annoy Shredder and generally make a mess of things. We want to see Shredder and Krang bickering. Too much time is wasted on collecting the artifacts needed to summon the Technodrome, or worrying about the mutagen that Shredder used to create Bebop and Rocksteady, or contemplating Megan Fox's admittedly fine physical attributes. As a result Krang and Shredder have almost nothing to do except stand around. The Technodrome is literally gone before it arrives. Even on the Turtles side, the story is so rushed that there is no time for them to be confused or undecided about what to do, no time to ask Splinter for advice, no time to get to know Casey, or to contemplate alternative plans of action. It's just do this, fight this, go there... And speaking of Casey Jones. He's supposed to be a scruffy brawler, someone who takes a shower once a week at best, who likes the Turtles sewer hideout because it smells nicer than his apartment. Not this guy.On the plus side, Bebop/Rocksteady are done really well and steal the movie. Kudos to Micheal Bay for making them a mixed-race gay couple, that was a nice gesture. Krang is also pretty great, he just isn't given enough agency. The Technodrome for what we saw of it looked awesome. And overall the movie, from a technical standpoint is really impressive.It's just that if you want a fun Turtles movie you gotta let the characters interact with each other, and not just participate in a scripted string of action set pieces."
" Over the top silly
",0.2263,0.718,2017-06-25 00:00:00,3,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is the supposedly sequel to the original hit released in 2014. Featuring a runtime of 114 minutes, the movie wears out its welcome before the last is hurled. This film felt more so of spin off to the Transformers films than the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turles. Being more over the top, silly, loud and annoying dialogue said by the turtles, this film feels more goofy than it should have been. The original film was greenlit a sequel not because it was great but because it was a surprise hit (near $500 million worldwide). The problems with this film is the plot isn't too original and very basic, with the action nothing special or anything we haven't seen before. Somehow they made the ninja turtles more annoying and repetitive compared to the first film. Also with the lead villains turned to animals. Megan Fox reprises her role and is solid, as well as Will Arnett and Stephen Amell. As with the original film, Out of the Shadows is also quite predictable with a good clean ending. Perhaps this film was a mistake as it flopped compared to the original."

" Worst Ninja Turtles movie in the TMNT franchise
",-0.6249,0.5569,2017-06-04 00:00:00,5,"When I first saw the trailer,it reminded me of the old movies which I loved to watch when I was a kid.But after I saw the movie in person,I became really disappointed on what the turtles franchise in live action was turning to.Like how the turtles look like Doomsday from DC Comics,April is not a redhead at all,they made the character Vern played by Will Arnett whose's character annoyed me in the movie before this and he became a celebrity,Casey Jones who is played by one of my favorite actor's Stephen Amell who plays as Green Arrow on Arrow is shown as a major wimp who wants to be a cop,and Casey Jones doesn't want to join the cops in any other adaption, he wants to be a vigilante .And shredder has long hair on this movie and I remember he had short hair in the first movie.So I give this movie a 1 out of 10 star,I wish I can give it a 0."
" All the characters are here now bringing back the former glory
",0.5423,0.9462,2017-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Where do I start? Bebop, Rocksteady, Krang and his Technodrome, Baxter Stockman played very well by Tyler Perry by the way and Casey Jones. Although Stephen Amell is well known for his serious role as arrow. It does not feel out of place here as a slightly more comic role. April O'Neil, Megan Fox never seizes to amaze me. When she goes undercover to steal from Baxter. The dialogues were silly with them discussing the difference between nerd and geek. She was sexy with those glasses and then when she slipped into the cheerleader outfit OMG. You could tell Michael Bay was a producer or someway associated with this movie from that scene alone. But also the transformer Halloween costume this other guy was wearing in a parade sort of gave it away. Anyway kudos though as all the characters tied in well if not perfect at least a decent effort. The pizza falling on the basketball court was hilarious. So was the turtles pranks on Casey Jones. The action sequences were awesome. The CGI on Bebop and Rocksteady was top-notch. As close to the eighties cartoon as they could get with this. Someone commented that the aliens coming through a portal was copying The Avengers and he claims to be a TMNT fan. If he were he would know that Krang is from another dimension so to get to this place he would have to get through a inter-dimensional portal. This was TMNT being TMNT and it is not like the Avengers own that plot because that kind of plot is almost universal in action Sci-Fi like this movie. Peace."
" A lukewarm endorsement of a Michael Bay-produced Turtles film? (*Will Arnett voice*) I've made a terrible mistake
",-0.4939,0.9953,2017-04-25 00:00:00,5,"Fun fact: if you google 'Out of the Shadows,' the first hit won't have anything to do with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Instead, you can peruse reviews for Dr. Patrick Carnes' ""premier work on understanding sexual addiction."" Yikes. In spite of this, I'll exercise incredible willpower, and resist the temptation to review the most mind-bogglingly 'how-did- this-get-greenlit' sequel to one of the most incredulously lukewarm blockbuster releases of the past decade through a Freudian psychoanalytic lens (don't think about what their pizza fixation could signify. Or Splinter. Shudder ), because the film is unexpectedly bonkers enough to warrant discussion on its own. What could possibly be unexpected about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II? Well, it's actually not all that bad. Yes. My mind is still reeling with a strange kind of shame from having written that sentence, but it holds: Out of the Shadows (yes, this one) is a trashy, willfully stupid, outlandishly big-budgeted B-movie that actually manages to channel a surprising amount of the kitschy, infectious fun of its '90s foam-ensconced predecessors. And the fact that the (still plentiful) fart jokes have transposed from CGI baby turtles to giant CGI humanoid rhinoceroses? Baby steps, my friends. The most egregious gripe of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles I: No, They're Not Aliens was its preposterous, half-baked insistence on 'gritty realism' amidst its fundamental ridiculousness, leaving 'fun' as foreign a concept as credible CGI. It's a misfire that new director Dave Green is eager to correct, pumping his film full of so much candy- coloured, neon zippiness it's almost dizzying. Proceedings are so deliriously '90s there's even a gratuitous basketball scene yanked straight out of Space Jam. Think of it as a conscious reversion from a thoroughly lazy crack at Christopher Nolan to the campy, cartoon histrionics of Joel Schumacher, but - plot twist - it actually making for a better film for a change. Yes. Really. Just thank the movie gods that Paramount stopped short of titling the sequel 'Turtles 4Eva.' Yeesh. 'Better,' of course is, only applicable insofar as the bar was set lower than the turtles' sewer lair. 'Plot' is still a farcically gossamer diversion, with a context-free extraterrestrial MacGuffin (yep - this time there ARE aliens!). The insertion of other Turtles stock characters (extraterrestrial arch-fiend Krang; Tyler Perry's amusing, chortling, bug-eyed mad scientist Baxter Stockman) into the fray adds to the cartoonish fun factor immensely, especially colourful behemoth henchmen Bebop and Rocksteady (Stephen Farrelly & Gary Anthony Williams), who are so jubilantly boorish they practically lumber off with the show, belching all the way. Still, the film's at its best when it doesn't pause for breath, as dour subplots bemoaning both the turtles and wannabe badass Casey Jones (whiny, bland Stephen Amell, boasting all the charisma of a hockey puck)' angst at being alienated and unappreciated by the world are dull, narrative dead weight. It's drolly poetic that most of their lamentations take place in a sewer. I'm sorry - did I say 'plot'? I clearly meant 'excuse to bash the giant CGI blobs into each other and sell toys.' But here, Green's commitment to the TMNT cartoon silliness is a monumental asset, as the action demonstrates a massive upgrade, not only in production values but in crucial playfulness (best bit: a plane/tank blowout more dopily enjoyable than 2010's The A-Team's similarly gratuitous fracas). Even the special effects look so obnoxiously expensive that their over-performance only adds to the camp factor. Then there's the heady, nausea-inducing, stimulus-vomit of a climax, where, in avoiding the screen, trying to prevent vertigo, I reflected I hadn't seen a frame that wasn't 100% CGI rendered in over 10 minutes. It's an oddly lonely feeling, briefly plunging me into an existential worry that the joke was on me, and I'd been suckered into caring about a morally bankrupt cash grab whose garish, capitalistic callousness I'd willingly rationalized as genial, nostalgic camp. But then: I remembered the turtle battle van that fires explosive manhole covers, and briefly staved off madness for another day. Phew! It helps that the titular quartet, Pete Ploszek, Jeremy Howard, Alan Ritchson, and Noel Fisher, all saddle into their archetypes earnestly enough to almost normalize their grotesque character designs, complete with less uncomfortable leering than Turtles I. Their collaborative clumsy charm makes for a surprisingly amiable watch, even coming close to echoing the lovable cheese of their '90s forefathers. Equally beneficial: corralling the sleepwalking Megan Fox from wooden lead to wooden supporting character, where she largely lurks in the background, propped up against the nearest surface, occasionally remembering to let her mouth hang open in a waxy approximation of 'sexy.' Will Arnett's tangible embarrassment at agreeing to his prolonged cameo, like a piece of gum tenaciously refusing to release your shoe, is such a masterclass of schadenfreude it's almost worth the watch in itself. But the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance: three-time Academy Award nominee Laura Linney valiantly fighting to retain dignity as a grouchy police chief (and, to her credit, mostly succeeding), avoiding derisive laughter all the while, is such a tour de force in restraint and composure it could be analyzed in a performance study class - preferably in the 'how to sell out in style' module. So, what we've learned: the best way to follow up a blockbuster almost too big, loud, and dumb to ethically exist is to make it even bigger, louder, and dumber? Oh dear god - never show this review to a panel of studio heads, or I'll never be able to live with myself. Still, singing along to the revamped credits theme song is disturbingly fun enough to (nearly) justify the brain cells gobbled up. Maybe the 3D was just powerful enough that I got concussed by one of those flying, explosive manhole covers. Yes, that must be it. -5/10"
" If you watched the cartoon growing up, then you loved this
",0.6808,0.9717,2017-04-06 00:00:00,9,"So many people are overly critical of this movie. This is exactly what the cartoon was like to watch. Krang was the main villain and Shredder was always frustrated playing second fiddle to him. Bebop and RockSteady make this movie for me. The director was true to their characters in the CARTOON. They even had the garbage truck that shoots ""Manhole Covers!"" Anyone else had this toy? What I love about this version of the Ninja Turtles and what makes it the best one of all the Ninja Turtle Movies made is that it's just true to them and their nature. The Ninja Turtles isn't supposed to be some serious drama of any kind. It's supposed to be for kids and the kid that's inside all of us adults. There are little bits here and there that could've been better, especially acting from the human characters, but overall this hits where it's supposed to. If you were a fan of the cartoon growing up then you'll love this. It gets a 9 out 10 because this is about as good as it's going to get for Ninja Turtles movie."
" Eh..
",0.0,0.9908,2017-03-12 00:00:00,6,"OK so I didn't grow up watching TMNT. I know, rare. But I'll try to be as honest about this movie as I can. First off, the animation is great. It's your typical modern day CGI, but it still looks pretty cool, in my opinion. However, the good part of the movie pretty much stops there, at least for me.The screenplay was, well, really bad, even embarrassing at times. Particularly when it came to Bebop and Rocksteady. I mean I know they're supposed to be dorks but some of the lines they came up with for those two..cringe-worthy. But overall the screenplay in general was just bland. I probably liked Shredders performance the most. I agree with the Megan Fox comments. Her acting isn't terrible but I think some of the scenes for her were just, well, for Megan Fox to be Megan Fox. You know, scenes for her to show off her body and all. But in general, the acting was poor at several points, the punch lines corny to the top (not necessarily a bad thing but still, kind of lame), and frankly uninteresting. The story-line is predictable as heck! Like I said, I never really watched the TMNT series, or even the first movie before this one (the one from 2014) but even still, the movie almost from the get go was extremely predictable, especially towards the end. In short, this movie for me was just average. The plot is predictable, the screenplay was mediocre, and clichÃ©s are present everywhere. The strongest point of the entire movie really is the animation. On a positive note, I love Bebop and Rocksteady in this movie, even if some of their lines were completely ridiculous!"
" A film that asks: why was I made?
",0.0,-0.9319,2017-02-26 00:00:00,3,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, is a sequel to 2014's reboot of the franchise. The first film in the series was generally poorly received, but did have some ""so bad its fun"" credentials. The 2016 sequel seems to have given this up completely, and offered a disappointing viewing experience to this viewer.The film follows the Turtles as they battle Shredder, recently busted out of prison, as he tries to open a portal to another world to bring the armies of Krang to Earth to take over. Shredder enlists scientist Baxter Stockman to create monstrous minions to battle the turtles. Unfortunately, they choose Bebop and Rocksteady, two of the worst criminals in the history of crime.The turtles face their usual issues of team dynamics, as Leonardo and Raphael compete for leadership, Mike is a goof and can't do anything right, and Donatello tries to guilt trip everyone. Master Splinter is distant and seemingly useless, Megan Fox is a damsel to save, and Casey Jones joins the crew as an annoying police officer. Basically, both sides seem inept in this film.The story is bland itself as well. The armies of Krang are coming, and Shredder needs to find three Mcguffins to put together and open the portal. Krang gives Shredder purple ooze that can be used to mutate humans into humanoid-animals that we all have in our genes(?), but Donatello thinks this can be used for a more noble purpose. This purpose splits the turtles team, and causes all sorts of drama that the Turtles prioritize over doing any crime-fighting. Also, their are stuck up FBI agents, fart jokes, weak characters and plots, and an overall silly tone and atmosphere.The film was not a complete waste however. Some of the sci-fi elements were interesting, if a bit campy, and their are some laughs to be had at the poor quality of film on offer here. It does have some legitimately ridiculous moments, and offers some basic laughs.Even so, the positives are outweighed heavily by the negatives. TMNT: Out of Shadows is a sequel nobody really looked forward too, and its poor quality acting, direction, writing, script and visuals are too much for the funny/bad moments and fun science fiction camp to make up for. This can be skipped safely for most casual watchers."

This movie is a fan service. Plain and simple. After the first movie kind of messed with the background of the turtles(this still remains a thing), and even totally screwed with The Shredders armour.This movie however makes up for a lot of those mistakes. First of all, they scaled back the turtles accessories that they wore in the first movie. Secondly, they re-designed The Shredders outfit to be more in line with the cartoon. They also added in characters such as Bebop, Rocksteady, Baxter Stockman, Casey Jones and even Krang(and the technodrome).It's like the writers/producers/whoever were trying to make it up to the fans.The movie was far more enjoyable than the first one. It even includes the original turtles theme tune in the closing credits, which even trails into the turtle rap from the 1991 movie, The Secret of the Ooze.All in all, a great movie. And I grew up with the original cartoon and movies(not saying the third one was any good).If there's a follow up to OOTS, I hope it keeps up this level of fan service."

I wasn't a fan of the first movie, but this one is a candy for the fans of the animated series, the nostalgia is real and I actually cracked a lot of laughs as it played. It is packed with action, toilet humour, the classic swinging between the emotions of the turtles and the rocky relationship they have with one another. I'm so happy they worked on it after the first, trashy movie. To me, this is geek gold, mainly cause it gives the audience exactly what they came to watch. Have a pleasant time with it! :)"

When the get in sync, it has nothing to do with each one using the trait supposedly associated with him. Suddenly, they're in sync.The movie starts out with little action. It's too much of the humor and the Turtles' annoying antics.Some of the action is good. But overall this falls way short of the old cartoons and way short of good."

The turtles had to go through some problems with Leonardo and Raphael fighting. the turtles had to go to the amazon to get the final piece of the technodrome but while there on the plane there bebop and rocksteady already got the final piece and heading back to new York city and as they jump on the plane the plane brakes into a small piece and Donatello flys the plane but crashes into the amazon river!
" At least it was better than the Ghostbusters reboot

It was a must buy for my collection since I had the first movie alreadyÂ and the kids wanted to see it anywayÂ so yesterday when the kids where at my place we sat down to watch it.It is definitely a movie for the younger audience. My two youngest kids had quite a few laughs while watching it and there was one ore two that entertained even me.Otherwise this movie is a rather messy concoction of loads and loads of CGI, action, stunts, cheesy comments and silly acting. It borders onÂ being a slapstick movie.Â It is rather unbelievable but Megan Fox was the one of the main actors that did the most serious performance in the movie.The enjoyment of this movie is pretty much the CGI action, ludicrous stunts, primarily by the turtles, plenty of explosions and gadgets. The turtles garbage truck was rather fun for example. Silly but fun. As an adult be prepared to leave you brain in idle and try to enjoy the cinematic magic that went into this movie. Then you might find it slightly enjoyable or at least not a total waste of time."
