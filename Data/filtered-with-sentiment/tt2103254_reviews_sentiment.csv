" Brilliant comedy
",0.743,0.8285,2021-04-11 00:00:00,10,I can not understand the negative reviews. This film is fun and well acted. It is one of the best comedies I've seen.Unless you have a problem with female leads or dislike vulgar humor I really don't see how you cannot appreciate this gem.I cannot recommend it enough.10/10.

" Such a bad movie
",-0.5423,0.1467,2021-03-24 00:00:00,1,"Incredibly bad movie. I was looking for some stupid movie to watch which means I had no expectations, but I was still disappointed. The film doesn't have a meaningful story, even though it's supposedly a comedy, I didn't laugh at all or thought I was watching a comedy. However, what is strangest to me and what I cannot understand in this film are the supporting roles. These are all extremely famous, proven and great actors, most of them Oscar winners and have multiple nominations. They have absolutely no role or task in this film, they show up and that's it. I see no reason why they accepted those roles at all. It sounds most logical to me that they lost a bet."

No one is ever going to watch this movie with the intent to take in a cinematic masterpiece. BUT. For whatever reason, this has become my comfort movie. I've seen it at least 20 times, and by god, it just never gets old. Melissa McCarthy is a funny lady, and she knew what she was doing getting Kathy Bates and Sandra Oh on board. All I want out of life is to attend a lesbian Fourth of July party just ONCE....Don't even get me started on Susan. Just let the record show that I would die for Pearl Balzen."

Melissa stunk it up especially hard, and proves yet again that she is a one-trick pony, with no talent to do any role other than her typical snobbish, bawdy, trashy, obnoxious, unfunny illigitimate child, birthed in the unholy drunken one-night stand between Rebel Wilson and Rosie O'Donnell. I would sooner watch the bikini-clad cast of The View Jell-O wrestle for an hour, than to endure five more minutes of this movie. How it made $100m is beyond me. This entire flick gave me volatile diarrhea, which was a pleasant treat, as it kept me in the bathroom for 15 minutes, instead of watching this garbage. Avoid this like the plague!"

" Funny Side Characters and a Slack Script.
",0.4404,0.9957,2019-10-03 00:00:00,3,"Review:
'Tammy' is an American comedy film directed by Ben Falcone. I went to this movie when it was in theatres and I remember being disappointed. I wanted to watch it again and give it another chance. I really enjoy Melissa McCarthy movies and didn't understand what didn't work. Upon re-watching it, I can still why I was so disappointed by it and figured out what was wrong.
This movie is a movie about middle aged woman (Melissa McCarthy) who is down on her luck, living with her parents and is looking for an adventure and a better life. She goes on a road trip with her grandmother (Susan Sarandon) and their search for adventure takes a turn with a bunch of bumps along the way.
There is one shining light in this film; and her name is Kathy Bates. I love this woman in everything she is in. No, she isn't the best actress working, but whenever she is in a film, she is always the one you end up remembering the most. Besides her, anyone in this movie could be replaced, including Melissa McCarthy. I don't understand what she was trying to accomplish in this movie, as I mentioned I love her work, I think she is brilliant when it comes to comedy. Nothing in this movie seemed like it was her, but she was being directed to do things that weren't her comedy.
Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy should not work together. I hate to say it because I love movies and believe everybody's story should be told. However, anybody can make a movie today if you're passionate enough about it. You just shouldn't always get to charge money for your project. I don't like any of Ben Falcone's work (""Tammy"", ""Life of the Party"" and ""The Boss""). None of these comedic films are enjoyable to me. I think it's due to the relationship between McCarthy and Falcone, nobody thinks that a married couple should work together. This circumstance is one that I agree with.
Overall, this movie can be watched if your looking to have something on in the background and see it on Netflix or playing on cable TV. It's not one I would seek out.
1.5/5"
" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.9818,2019-09-29 00:00:00,10,Typically not kind of film I'd pick but it was my partners turn to pick and she made a great choice! Definitely had a few laughs and didn't get bored once during the movie and kept me guessing to the very end highly recommend this film if you like a giggle
" Nice effort
",0.4215,0.127,2019-06-17 00:00:00,5,I enjoyed this movie a lot the first time I watched it. But I'm the kind of person who watches the movie daily if I really liked it but I couldnt watch it again. It was not that funny for me. I only liked the part where Tammy was fired and licking the burger bunns and when she left her house carrying her clothes only to go two houses down to her mothers house. That was funny for me. Other than that it became a drama and not a comedy. I say Melissa and Ben will get it right one day. They are on a good track.
" Not really funny at all
",-0.3865,0.8098,2019-04-26 00:00:00,1,"Now having seen all Melissa McCarthy's movies, this and The Boss seemed to me the most unfunny movies she has ever been.All starts when her bad luck gets her fires by her real-life husband Ben Falcone, and just continues to flat line faster and faster. I think after seeing this I just laughed maybe not even once. I don't know if this was meant to be honestly funny or cutesy, but it seemed like it fell off the wagon.Not really a movie I would recommend to others because the pace is too slow and makes you want to sleep through it. That bad."
" Light, very light comedy with weak plot
",-0.0314,0.9118,2019-04-03 00:00:00,4,"I watched ""Identity thief"" and enjoyed Melissa acting and verve: she can really be funny and dramatic and drive a film with her emotions.
Then I decided to watch Tammy full of hope and I ended being disappointed.
To be fair, the beginning is quite brilliant, the story had potential and Melissa is doing her thing...but:
1. The story is so weak it seems to be written along the way.
2. The excellent cast is pointless, none has a good part.
3. The watcher is constantly waiting for a joke, a punch line, a fanny thing that never arrives.
4. Many comedies have a drama background, this one makes no exception but even the dramatic part is weak.
5.It's cute that the real life couple McCarthy - Falcone are making films together but this one sounds like and home made video - it only lacks the 8 or 16 mm film.I use to watch so many films it's okay I watched this one too but I could have spent the time far much better, even taking a nap."
" Loved this film!
",0.636,-0.4401,2019-03-09 00:00:00,10,"Never heard of this movie but happened to see it on TBS this afternoon and found it thoroughly hilarious. Sorry to see so many negative reviews here, but wanted to throw in my 2 cents that I found it beyond hilarious and ridiculous!"
" Lots of potential
",0.0,0.7398,2019-02-15 00:00:00,5,"Great cast, a potentially good storyline but the script was dire. I didn't enjoy it the first time but I kept thinking about it's good parts now and then so I watched it again and it grew on me. Note I've seen it 4 times and I do recommend giving it a go."
" Oh No Tammy!
",-0.3595,0.874,2019-01-23 00:00:00,3,"When she's good (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy) she's very entertaining, but when she's bad ... well like a lot of characters in Tammy, you just don't want to know Melissa McCarthy. And Tammy is a film which doesn't see McCarthy displaying anywhere near her best work.The main problem with Tammy is Tammy. She is just a terribly unlikeable, unsympathetic character. And she is in your face right from the start of this film, so much so, that when she and we find out that her husband Greg is having an affair with Missi, their next door neighbour, we don't feel sorry for the cuckolded Tammy ... at all.This precipitates the movie turning into a parodied version of Thelma and Louise for the next hour or so and features Louise herself (Susan Sarandon) playing of all people, Tammy's grandmother. Can I just add here that all the grey wigs/hair colourings in the world could never convince me that Susan Sarandon is middle-aged Melissa McCarthy's grandmother (and Allison Janney's mother for goodness sake!). The two women hit the road and find themselves embroiled in a number of uncomfortably awkward, unfunny episodes during which they are supposed to bond, learning in the process, more about themselves and each other. All I can say is that an unholy blend of alcoholism, diabetes, robberies, frequent littering and vandalism in just about equal proportions, doesn't guarantee a funny film, no matter how experienced the cast. And the casting of Tammy, does have depth, if nothing else.Like Thelma and Louise, Tammy also concludes at the edge of a precipice, but with a happier outcome. Quite honestly I wish this car wreck of a comedy had driven over the edge a lot earlier, putting the title character and her unbelievable grandma out of their joint misery. How this misfire managed to be a commercial success I'll never know."
" NOT GONNA LET 'EM CATCH THE MIDNIGHT RIDER
",0.0,-0.5932,2018-11-19 00:00:00,5,"Melissa McCarthy revives her over-the-top bossy fat chick role. This role worked extremely well in ""The Heat"" but fails to create chemistry in ""Tammy."" Melissa plays the victim. After hitting a deer, wreaking her car, losing her job, and leaving her cheating husband she teams up with her drunken grandma (Susan Sarandon) for a road trip to Niagara Falls. They meet some guys along the way, share stories, and then the truth gets ugly creating a downer to a film already flailing, looking for direction.You would be better off watching ""The Heat"" again. 3 stars is generous.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Implied sex. No nudity."
" Way better than reviews suggest
",0.4404,0.9677,2018-11-03 00:00:00,8,"Is this the best comedy of all time? Nope. However my husband and I laughed out loud several times throughout the movie and I don't recall the last time a movie made me do that. It's been a minute. Melissa McCarthy is the master at playing seemingly very unlikable characters that you find yourself pulling for once the story gets going. There were some sincerely sweet moments sprinkled with some decidedly lower brow humor but with some truely funny moments, too. Mark Duplass was very charming in his role as well."
" Comical but Stupid
",-0.6808,0.4872,2018-09-18 00:00:00,7,"Let's start off by saying that I am NOT a fan of comedy movies. Especially stupid comedy like Tammy. In fact, I probably couldn't name five comedy movies I actually like.With that being said, I actually enjoyed Tammy a lot. It was absolutely hilarious to me. The stupid humor amused me, and I found myself laughing throughout the whole movie. Even the serious parts I found myself laughing remembering the previous scenes of the film. The story is weird and in my opinion depicts every average Americans actions when things go wrong. Run away from your problems, and drink your money away.I will most likely never rate a comedy movie this high again. Thanks for the laughs Tammy! 7/10"
" Can melissa mcarthy ever be funny?
",0.4404,0.0027,2018-09-03 00:00:00,1,"WASTE OF TIME all melissa mccarthey does is swear because she cant think of actual jokes, dont get me wrong i like stupid vulgar humor, but something about her ultra dependence on it always really brings it down a level"
" Not a Masterpiece but Doesn't Deserve all the Hate
",-0.8018,0.995,2018-07-16 00:00:00,6,"As a big fan of both Allison Janney and Susan Sarandon, this film was a must-watch for me. It's one of those ones that slips the mind when it first comes out, however, and I did not get a chance to view it until today. The plot was slightly thin, the characters slightly predictable, and I felt like there was a ton of filler material that should have been avoided, but all in all, it was a lot of fun. We all know that Hollywood pumps out a ton of cheap humor these days, and to some, (probably most), Tammy is no exception. However, there are times when cheap humor is acceptable and times when it's not. This is one of those times when it is. I mean, come on, this film was never meant to be an Oscar winner or even on the lips or fingertips of some high ranking critic. Even with its mix of dirty jokes, uncomfortable moments and cliché-ridden situations, there is so much more beneath the surface. The two aforementioned actresses completely nailed their roles (especially Sarandon as the hard drinking, no expenses spared grandma) and I must also give props to Kathy Bates and Sandra Oh. It's not every day that a plethora of big name actors lend their talent to lesser-known productions and I think it's highly admirable of all these fine women, as they clearly wanted to make a film that really spoke to their souls. Melissa McCarthy deserves the biggest mention of all, as she co-wrote the film with her husband, (who also directed it), and if you know anything about McCarthy, she is nothing if not feisty and fun loving in a commanding way. I give it 6 stars. It's definitely not anything special but if you want to relax, escape from the daily grind of life and enjoy a real silly film with real heart, Tammy is a pretty great choice."
" Worst movie ever. Not one laugh & a real waste of money.
",-0.8697,-0.8074,2018-07-16 00:00:00,1,"This movie sucks. If men were the stars , it would have been torn up by critics. But, somehow since it is a female cast, it managed to be seen & promoted. What a waste & insult to movie fans."
" This movie makes me happy
",0.5719,0.8105,2018-07-16 00:00:00,7,All these negative reviews?? I love watching this movie it made me laugh. It was a feel good movie.
" Not horrible, but I wouldn't watch it again.
",0.2323,0.9553,2018-05-25 00:00:00,4,"While this film came out in 2014, I just saw it in 2018 because I am trying to see as many Melissa McCarthy movies as what appeals to me, so yeah, I am really late to the game. 
I happen to think that Melissa is a great comedic actress. I didn't know until I saw the beginning credits that she wrote this film. The storyline in itself is a good one, but what is it with her? Someone told me all her films were very trashy and vulgar. Is this why she has become so popular? I myself do not like trashy and vulgar movies. I like to enjoy clean movies with a storyline that stirs my emotions and leaves me thinking long after the movie is over. In addition to ""Identity Thief"" that I just watched today as well, ""Tammy"" is loaded with unnecessary ""F"" bombs and a handful of sexual innuendoes as well as the topic of homosexuality, all of which were unnecessary and added nothing at all to the film. But worse than those things is the constant usage of taking the Lord's name in vain, which as a Christian I don't tolerate. There is absolutely never a good reason to take the Lord's name in vain, especially in a film. I cringed every time I heard it and think I heard it about six times. However, because I had wanted to see this film for so long, and because I bought it on DVD, I decided to see it through. Because I am a Christian, someone told me I would absolutely hate this film, but I had already purchased the DVD, so I thought I would see it through. He asked me why I didn't read the reviews and the parental warnings before I bought it. Honestly, I had never thought of it. I watched the trailer and was hooked and wanted to see it because it looked very funny. My friend was wrong, I didn't hate it, I thought it was okay, but I will not be watching it again. 
Next on my Melissa McCarthy marathon list is ""St. Vincent"" as I'd like to find out why she is rated 27 on IMDb right now. 
The film had great production value and great DP work. The editing was also top notch. But because of all the things I did not like about this film, I can only rate it a four out of ten stars."
" Junk
",0.0,0.5267,2018-05-21 00:00:00,4,"Tammy felt like a Saturday Night Live skit stretched out to 90 minutes. In fact, Melissa Mccarthy was like a female Chris Farley and she even hit a deer in the first scene like the deer scene in Tommy Boy. Her character was of two notes: Angry or sad.

" Not as Bad as Reviewers Say, but...
",0.431,0.9839,2018-04-15 00:00:00,5,"Could have been much better!Comedy is catching lightening in a bottle. McCarthy's performance in Bridemaids was on par with Chris Farley in Tommy Boy...great! She was perfection in that role and stole the movie. In Tammy, I agree, the MM effect was already wearing thin. She is a fat actress and her roles limited. Another argument, but welcome to Hollywood? She ain't competing with Emily Blunt for roles, and she did not look good in this movie. Her complexion made her look almost ill or like she was in rehab.So...this is where your supporting cast comes in to rescue the day. Casting Kathy Bates is always a good choice! A director's dream...""Ok, great, that role is solid, move on..."" Susan Sarandon was also good and much respect for playing grandma. What actress known for her curves and sassy spirit wants to play grandma? There really is no excuse for a bad script with all the methods out there. Dramatica is one of the best and if they hired the Dramatica team, this would have been 100x better. Make the effort! If they would have gone to a screenwriter workshop with this and let them loose, you would have had a much tighter script with added soul, and this movie came close to having a lot of soul. That would have saved it. A movie that was deeply touching.Another coulda, woulda, shoulda movie..."
" Hammy
",0.0,0.7638,2017-06-20 00:00:00,2,"A movie with the title of the main character usually means that person is kind of you know unique and, um... special... Well in a matter of speaking, the latter fits TAMMY since it's a ""labor of love"" by star Melissa McCarthy, serving as a producer and co-writer along with her husband and the film's director, Ben Falcone.We begin with Tammy hitting a deer, the first similarity to Chris Farley's TOMMY BOY, and not the last: Both centering on a self-evasive, overweight slacker with a heart of gold, our husky heroine, TAMMY, revels in her problems, including a wrecked car, lost job, cheating husband and a comparably raw and restless grandmotherEnter Susan Sarandon, the reason TAMMY is being compared to the iconic feminist cult flick, THELMA & LOUISE... But be warned: this is not a road movie. After a quick highway montage, promising themselves an adventure full of cathartic mileage, Tammy and Sarandon's bluntly honest Pearl hit a snag after one night of drinking. At this point the movie repeats itself with saucy conversations about how Tammy needs a point in life, and Pearl needs less men, pills, alcohol. And so, as a loose cannon, Sarandon doesn't provide very much input or purpose. For an actress with her talent and long-lasting career, with the exception of a gray mop of a phony looking wig, she doesn't seem to be the age she's playing... Instead of trying to portray an old lady who tries to be young and gets away with it, but still suffering just a bit, deep down, she's just... Susan Sarandon. And McCarthy has little to offer as well, having, along with her husband, written a story so self-absorbed, it hardly seems catered to an audience at all. (More at CultFilmFreaks.com)"
" What Genre is this?
",0.0,0.9262,2017-05-27 00:00:00,1,"Not funny, not scary, not dramatic, not puzzling and not terrifying. No wonder this went to TV so quickly. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. I recorded it and I'm wondering, do I finish viewing? Moulin Rouge, is the only film I've walked out on. Maybe this is the second one. The computer says you have to submit 5 lines. OMG! How does one find enough to say about this non-event movie. Please tell me that I have got to 5 lines by now. Gee whizz! I must be funnier than this movie. Ha Ha!"
" A very different kind of movie.
",0.0,-0.9381,2017-03-24 00:00:00,6,"I am surprised by the really horrible reviews, but i think it is really due to the fact that this is a movie without a genre. (I also suspect people didn't like this movie because they can only handle an over-weight, unattractive female star when she is being funny and not when she is being human.)First of all, this is not a comedy, though it has some funny moments and the main character is comic, but she's also sad, lost, and a mess. It is not an action movie, either. The script that is frankly rather uneventful. Nor is it a romance, and I suspect more than one movie goer was totally turned off by the very unattractive heroine. Her very dumpiness is a whole part of the story, however, and I was so happy that for once to see some realism in US cinema.There IS a moment when the heroine gets a barely make-over but then she just goes back to being dumpy (albeit with a little more self-confidence) so I guess this is not a teen movie either.So what is it? A story about a very realistic, uneducated, dumpy, woman in middle America with a slightly abusive mother, an alcoholic grandma, childhood trauma, and a crappy job and car that goes on an almost adventure and figures out she needs to get her life together. That's it. Its a very non Hollywood movie, but its freshness charmed me and I can see why it charmed so many talented actors to star in it."
