Suriya's acting was mind blowing as I can't even imagine other actors in place of him.

",0.3716,0.957,2020-10-18 00:00:00,4,"Great cinematography, story and VFX but rest are cliches.
What this film lacks?
Good acting. There is nothing special in acting. Suriya is just like other main actor in south Indian movies. Same old clich√© love story. Same old dumb heroine. Same old family story.
Indian women did not wear churidar in 40s but nitya menon character is shown wearing churidar. I have seen the Time freezing concept in Disneys Duck tales cartoon. They could have made it better. It was more like a fantasy story rather than sci fi.
Nothing special or memorable BGM. Just a forgettable movie."
" Best Sci-fi ever made in India !!
",0.6988,0.9862,2020-08-09 00:00:00,10,"First of all I would whole heartedly Thanks Kollywood for giving such a brilliant Concept movie. Vikram Kumar garu Take a bow,Your direction is phenomenal !
Script and Screenplay Pitch perfect. People should Not mind some unrealistic scenes because the movie genre is Sci-Fi, Even Hollywood Sci-fi movies shows unrealistic scenes,that's what the genre of movie demands.
Now coming to Suriya,This man is unmatchable in screen performance.Versatile,Exceptional in every character whether it's Old Athreya or a youngster Mani. This will be remembered as one of Suriya's best performance ever. Special mention Ajay, this man is a wonderful artist. All other supporting cast did a great job. As the movie was 60% vfx,Big salute to the VFX team for doing a tremendous job. AR rahman music for well crafted as per movie. This movie will always feel something new eachtime you watch !"
" Best sci-fi movie in Kollywood
",0.6369,0.9974,2020-08-08 00:00:00,8,"A fantastic film which is based on time travel where actor Suriya plays an 3 non identical roles, who proves his strength and power in acting which these challenging roles and a special mention to the negative role ""Athraya"" where the role made the movie next level.The heroine is cute and lovely to watch ""Samantha"" where she have done her role which is given the script exactly, and the other supporting actors have done there part correctly, Every character in the movie add some value to movie and none of character is useless.Director Vikram K kumar has taken a hard story line but makes it simple & exciting with his screenplay and after a long time this is the best interval block you could ever see.The Cinematography S.Thirunavukkarasu & Kiran Deohans makes the film more beautiful and in script which revolves around time needs a strong Art team hats off to Art director Amit Ray who made it perfectAlways a special mention to AR Rahman the best music direction in India have done his job perfectly and gave us beautiful songs which adds more positive to film and he is only music direction who gave compose for these kind of scripts .Where is negative part the film has some love portion which is slightly dragging but it show the commercial angle, and most of the people feels like they wont connect to these kind of film which is based on sci fi which should be changed because very one can love the film.Verdict: if you thing you cant connect the film just go and watch for the acting of Suriya which makes a feel like my 150 rs is worth for the film.Thank You"
" Wasted opportunity but refreshing to watch.
",-0.0516,0.8949,2020-08-05 00:00:00,7,"I had some high hopes with 24 (2016). But I was disappointed with it.
I was expecting some paradoxes in the movie, some sort of predestined event that was inevitable, but nothing was there to wow.
Perhaps happy ending made it bit boring. Could have been certainly better. Character of Sathya (Played by Samantha) felt useless and that character had little to no major affect on storyline.
The reason for rivalry between the Brothers (Athreya & Shiva Kumar) is not mentioned in the movie.
I expected more from this movie especially with Time Travel concept.
Movie is average just because concept is new doesn't make it any better.
My rating would be 6.5."

" A Future Classic
",0.0,0.9941,2019-06-18 00:00:00,10,"24 is a ground breaking movie in Tamil cinema
This is something new and different
This is going to be one of the best sci-fi movies in IndiaSuriya is at his best in this movie. He does an amazing job in doing triple role as a father, villain, and hero. Samantha Akkinei is of course beautiful and does justice to her role as the hero's lover. You will love her expressions. Nithya Menon does a great job in being the hero's biological mother. Ajay of course makes his presence memorable as the villain's companion. And of course we have the evergreen actors, Saranya Ponvannan as the mother of the hero and Girish Karnad as Sathya's grand father.A. R. Rahman proves himself once again composing songs that people will remember for this generation and the next and he always tries something new
The BGM is just amazing suiting the movie very well and just ahead of its timeVikram K. Kumar is going to be one of the best directors of India. Really he did an amazing job in directed a time travel movie and the screenplay is just on point. The cinematography just wows you throughout this whole movie.24 is a must watch for not only Suriya fans but action and sci fi fans. This is recommended for movie lovers who love something different in India which is something for you. 24 is looking to be a future cult classic and a movie regarded as one of the best in India. Don't miss out because time flies!"

And cinemetograpar super"
" Craziest film I've seen so far
",-0.0516,0.9952,2019-01-12 00:00:00,8,"Time travelling is pretty much alien to Indian industry let alone regional cinema. Tamil cinema has succeeded in making worthy time travel movie which is not only interesting but entertaining as well. Even though it's science fiction still it would be better if you don't delve deeper otherwise you'll be deprived from fine entertainer.
Cast- Suriya is one of the few tamil actor who could act, fight and dance. He is a perfect package. Samantha has nothing much to do other than be a barbie doll. Saranya playing mother's role which is obvious, her forte. Nithya menon has to look pretty and cute. Other actors have done their job respectively well.
Music & bgm- Background score stand out the most. Music were just placed because it's a typical Indian concept. Songs were good but just that it wasn't required. Seems forced to me.
Technical- it has technical finesse which is called for and they've pulled it off with elan. Frames captured essence of locales.
Overall it's a good afternoon watch if you've spare time. If you're fan of sci-fi genre and have seen plenty of it probably this is not your cake. Since we're not aware of how time machine works so the makers have taken that liberty of the logic and made 24. Just don't go behind the logic and enjoy the feast."

" Review ‚Äì 24 (2016)
",0.0,0.999,2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"'24' by Vikram K Kumar is essentially a family drama centered around the idea of time-travel. However, the film also includes elements of romance, action and thrills in ample measures, even though the bulk of the screen time is spent on emphasizing the significance of familial bonds (Appa-Amma-Thaatha-Maama-Maami and so on).The director, who recently made the Telugu drama 'Manam' still seems slightly hungover from it. He has proved that he loves playing with the concept of time (13B, Manam). But the surprise in the screenplay here comes in the form of sci-fi elements. Tamil cinema (and Suriya himself of course!) has been churning out many sci-fi thrillers in recent times (Enthiran, Dashavathaaram, 7aum Arivu, Maattraann, Anegan, Indru Netru Naalai to name a few). Some of these were characterized by an overdone formulaic story replete with masala, while a few of them stood out for their innovative screenplays and seamless blend of sci-fi with other genres.'24' marks a return to the sci-fi genre for Suriya. Hats off to the man for taking up this expensive and ambitious project after many a recent failure (Maasss, Anjaan, Maattraann, 7aum Arivu) and funding it himself. I will not shy away from saying that the production values look top-notch and the CGI is mostly sans notable flaws. The sets boast of decorative extravagance and are mostly a treat to the eyes, at times resembling the lavishness of Shankar films. The cinematography by Tirru is nothing short of spectacular in the initial portions. It would also warrant special mention that different color-tones are attributed to different characters with respect to their portrayal in the film. For instance, the intelligent, yet tender (and at times, clumsy) Dr. Sethuraman (Suriya) and his wife (played by Nithya Menen in an extended cameo) gleam in lighter shades (of golden yellow) while his evil brother Aathreya is burnished in darker shades (of brown).The story is really not that path-breaking to be honest but still holds narrative interest owing to the director's firm grip on attention levels of the audience, by way of utilizing its star lead's boyish charm during the romantic interludes, as well as a welcome change of seeing him play the character of a psychotic antagonist. Aathreya wants his brother's time-travelling device (which happens to be a watch) by hook or by crook and is even willing to murder his brother and his family for the same. Suriya depicts the antagonist Aathreya in a style of his own and the actor seemingly looks like he had fun doing so. The devilish grin and the plain stares are placed at apt junctures by the actor. Suriya, the romantic charmer that he is, uses his potential to the maximum in the scenes with Samantha, although, however cute they may look initially, start to wear out and eventually end up bland. The romance is underplayed in the first half, with Mani (son of Dr. Sethuraman, again played by Suriya) using his time-travel watch to woo Sathya through various instances of play-pause-repeat. ""I'm a watch mechanic madam, enakku ithellaam sarva sadhaaranamaana vishayam"" is a line that brings both laughs and shrugs. Some of the wooing methods deployed here are fun to watch though, and this makes the first half a mildly entertaining affair. The amazing opening segment as well as intriguing interval block are admittedly where the writer-director scores brownie points.The film slows down considerably in initial portion of the second half with family sentiments (even though Saranya Ponvannan is consistently marvellous at her job of exuding maternal warmth!) and downright- silly romance segments thrown in simply for the purpose of extending the run-time. Thankfully, it does not take too long for the sci-fi element to bounce back and take its rightful position in the film and the viewer is rewarded with a feel-good (rather feel- great!) climax. However, it needs be bluntly accepted before and after watching the film that a lot of it works purely on coincidences rather than logic or situational coherence.A R Rahman's music+BGM is certainly a plus-factor although personally, I am of the opinion that a sci-fi film would be much better off without so many song-n-dance routines. If you, as a viewer, are able to forego these minor masalaic tropes and are okay with a run-time of 160 mins (editing dept. could have done better!), then you are in for a decently satisfying sci-fi treat!"
" One way of time travel ‚Äì nice innovation.
",0.6597,0.9559,2017-06-01 00:00:00,8,"There are various time travel movies having their own peculiar logic. In most of the movies like ""predestination"", the subject travels independently and more than one instance can be present. In some of them like in Harry potter and prisoner of Azkaban the new instance of time traveler tries to hide from older instance. The reason I like this movie is its own time travel logic, more than one instance of a time traveller cannot exist. And the one who travels only knows about what has happened. The subject's age changes too.Another reason why I like this movie, it's light and easy on mind with all its coziness on one side and enmity on other.Hats off to director Vikram K. Kumar, for his efforts and guts to direct such movie in India. Thanks to the Audience in accepting this effort. We all need to encourage such effort."
" Vikram Kumar-Suriya flick is an Entertaining and Brilliant watch
",0.7717,0.9945,2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"It is very often we see a brilliantly written and executed Science-fiction thriller in Indian Cinema and 24 is one among them for sure. Director Vikram K Kumar, who also wrote the screenplay is rthe star.The complex screenplay works so well and misses nothing that is needed for a Tamil movie.Movies like Kabali,Theri came with stories that are told many times, 24 is fresh.Suriya needs to appreciated for the portrayal of the three roles,especially Athreya. The movies is all about a cat and mouse between Mani and Athreya for the time machine.It also contains a love track between Suriya and Samantha, which lags and is not up to the mark. A.R Rahman's music could be credited as one of the pluses for the song Naan Un .S. Thiru is another highlight of the flick.He has done a marvellous job in almost all the scenes.The VFX in the film is one of India's best works.The BGM gives the mood.The narrative is kept simple throughout and is entertaining.24 is a cleverly crafted science fiction thriller which has it's strengths like the energetic performance from Suriya, a brilliant screenplay,excellent VFX etc.The love track is the only thing which makes us bored.Overall it could be credited as one of the best Indian movies of 2016.If you are looking for something different,this is for you.It will never disappoint youüòÉ"
" BEST Sci-Fi Movie ever made India !!! Best Time Traveller Movie ever made in WORLD !!!
",0.9062,0.9811,2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"I just watched it. And I am speechless. Its the best sci-fi movie I have seen since Intersteller.The main driver of the film is the Story of the film and the director has done an amazingly perfect work on the story. Next is the Hero/Villain of the movie - Suriya. I have been a fan of Suriya after I watched his movie Masss. Suriya is an amazing actor. Since he is playing 3 different roles in the movie, a person watching the movie just forget it and feels like those 3 are all together different persons. I think thats make him an outstanding actor.About the movie. The movie is gripping from its first scene only. You cannot skip a single scene. I didn't understand the songs of the movie because I am not South Indian but believe me they are all sounds really good as the composer is AR Rahman. The man has given an amazing score to the film. During the movie there are so many twists and turns that you cannot predict and explains the quality of the movie. I will not say about the ending of the movie, you just have to watch the movie for it.MY RATING - 10 STARS Go and watch it. Don't Skip it at any cost. This is the best Sci-fi Movie India has ever produced."
" Very Very disappointing
",-0.5819,0.8466,2017-01-04 00:00:00,5,"makers had a lots of opportunity to make the film better,but i am afraid they are unable to leave the impacts..although there are few twist and turns in the movie but no one is remarkable , moreover there are few mistakes as well like how the Athreya know that he should sign the cheque accurately, i mean how he knew the activity of the past while the watch being used by the Surya ,how the hell Athreya remember. story line is so dumb and weak, i mean if you have such kind of power and you are going to use it for stopping the rain or impress the girl nobody even care either the girl like the boy or not they are totally wasted 46 minutes in such childish love scenes.i am waiting for this movie very eagerly but i don't like it too much , it was boring....if you have really have good taste in time travel and sci fi movies then you know what i mean to say..."
