" nothing in life is free
",0.5106,0.9347,2021-02-26 00:00:00,1,"There is no such thing as ""free to play"" nothing in life is free. The first resource you're burning away is your time which is the most precious of it all. No matter how rich you are you wont buy back wasted time nor your mental health wasted on gaming etc. Competitive gaming was a thing since games were invented so stop with this idiocy like this event is something revolutionary. All in all ""pro"" gaming is just another pathetic gimmick media BS to turn away attention from things that need to be addressed."
" This has aged pretty well

Very good one."
" Good doc
",0.4404,0.8765,2018-06-28 00:00:00,7,"I realize that this pieces is a passive commercial and the filmmakers likely had to fulfill a contract, but it's good anyway. I have recently started binging on esports docs and this is one of the better ones."
" Professional video games: fascinating!
",0.5848,0.5267,2017-04-18 00:00:00,8,"Free to Play is a 2014 documentary film by American video game company Valve Corporation. The film takes a critical look at the lives of Benedict ""hyhy"" Lim, Danil ""Dendi"" Ishutin and Clinton ""Fear"" Loomis, three professional Defense of the Ancients (DotA) players who participated in The International, the most lucrative eSports tournament at the time. The central focus of the film is how their commitment to DotA had affected their lives and how this debut tournament for the sequel, Dota 2, would bring more meaning to their struggles."
" This documentary is worth playing, despite a few flaws.
",0.4019,0.9979,2017-03-07 00:00:00,8,"Upon first viewing this film, I was very unfamiliar with the Defense of the Ancients franchise. I had no clue that DOTA 2 was a sequel to a multiplayer online battle arena mod for the 2002's video game, 'Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos' and its 2003 expansion, 'Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne'. I also had no choice that the Valve game was so popular, that the game developer, create a tournament in which, 16 teams of five gamers around the world fight it out for prize money. All of this, made the documentary very interested. However, while, the movie does a good job, showcasing the E-sport event, and some of its key contestants such as Benedict ""hyhy"" Lim from the Singaporean team 'Scythe Gaming', Clinton ""Fear"" Loomis, an American player from the international team, 'Online Kingdom', and Danil ""Dendi"" Ishutin of Ukrainian team 'Natus Vincere'; it doesn't do a good job, explaining, the game and it's rules that much. Why, because some of the fantasy genre gaming jargon still, went over my head. Don't get me wrong, DOTA 2 looks fun, but it also looks too overcomplicated for my taste. I don't know, why certain characters work this moment, and not for others. It's sad, because I do like some video games that takes some thinking, but the concept is a little too complex, for what looks like a simple game of capture the flag. I really can't get into it, even if I wanted. Also, since the game deals with the whole medieval fantasy genre, it looks like it will forever be, a niche market, here in America. While, America does have some appeal to fantasy gaming, it's just not as big as it is in Europe or Asia, due to the fact, that our culture and history is semi new, compare to the old worlds. That's why modern day 'first shooter games' like 'Call of Duty' will outsell 'DOTA 2' any day. It's just not as popular as it, use to be. Plus, other fantasy games like 'League of Legends' is really giving 'DOTA', a taste of competition. I doubt 'DOTA 2', would appeal to those, main audience like, the film portray, it will in a couple years. The film felt a little bit of propaganda; seeing how the film is produce by Valve. It gave all the possible opportunities, but little of the negative. One such example is the movie title. For a movie that titled 'Free to Play', they don't really talk much about the business practice that Valve Corporation use. I guess, the film didn't want to showcase it, too much, because they didn't want people to find out that 'free to play' is technically, not really 'free'. Most 'free to play' games, have players willing to pay for special items or downloadable content, so they may be able to gain a significant advantage over those playing for free. Because of this, some critics call such games ""pay-to-win"" or ""p2w"" games. A common suggestion for avoiding pay-to-win is that payments should only be used to broaden the experience without affecting gameplay. For example, 'DOTA 2' only allows the purchase of cosmetic items, meaning that a ""free-to-play player"" will be on the same level as a player who has spent money on the game, however, since this movie doesn't tell you, the game mechanics would encourages players to pay for extra content that enhances the gameplay, all the time, when in truth, it doesn't affect much, leading to some shady marketing. It's a big concern as games like this, has cause some gamers to gain gambling addiction and finance bankruptcy. Despite that, the movie does tackle the stresses of committing to being good on one game, and its troublesome results with destroying family unions, education and relationship. I do like the physiological character study of the gamers, they feature here, even if one of them, seem a little too obsessed with getting back with an old fling. Unfortunately, the movie does not show, what would happen, to them, once the game, they were playing, become obsolete. Do they try to learn a new game or just quit!? After all, the shelf-life of a video game is pretty short, compare to real-life activities. Also, what makes a person, a veteran in a fairly young medium? This movie should had explore that, more. Another thing, why didn't this film, show the lives of even, one female gamer? It's seem to me, when watching this documentary, that e-sport is a male-driven contest, when in truth, female gamers make just as big as an impact as men in 'DOTA 2' like Jorien van der Heijden or Danelie Purdue. Despite that, the movie is beautifully shot and expertly edited. The game footage, while repetitive is spiced up so well, with the reaction of the gamers and the intense music that it makes, watching the tournament seem like a very heated contest. Overall: While, gaming is still often frowned upon by a wide margin of society as a childish activity which is not to be taken seriously. Films like this, shows that there is somewhat of a future, for pro-gamers, even if they been disconnected from the main server of having a normal life. In the end, this documentary was challenging and worth the time, exploring. So don't be a noob. Go check out, this film and see a different level of playing games."
