" Not a sequel I liked
",-0.3252,0.7327,2021-03-11 00:00:00,6,"Improves towards the end, but for the most part 'Pitch Perfect 2' is a disappointing sequel.I wouldn't say it's anything bad, but even soon after viewing I am struggling to remember any good moments from it. I found the cast and music to be the big plus points to 'Pitch Perfect', though both of those things are off in this follow-up.Anna Kendrick (Beca) doesn't really do anything, at least very little that's even close to being memorable. Skylar Astin (Jesse) takes a back seat, which I don't actually think is a negative. Adam Devine (Bumper) and Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) aren't as amusing, though the story featuring those two probably did interest me most. Hailee Steinfeld, meanwhile, is an alright addition.Not a sequel I liked. Hopefully the third film improves upon this."
" Pitch Perfect 2
",0.5719,0.9987,2021-01-30 00:00:00,5,"The first movie was a surprise big hit, and I was pleasantly surprised by it myself, it was inevitable that a sequel would follow, and I was looking forward to it, produced and directed by Elizabeth Banks. Basically, it has been three years since the Bellas, from Barden University, won the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCAC), they are now led by senior Beca Mitchell (Anna Kendrick) and three-time super senior Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow). They have been successful champions for each of these three years. But the group's reputation when they cause a national scandal dubbed ""Muffgate"" when Patricia ""Fat Amy"" Hobart (Rebel Wilson) accidentally rips her pants in front of U.S. President Barack Obama during a performance on his birthday at the Kennedy Center, and not wearing underwear showing her genitalia to the public. Following this, the Bellas are suspended from the ICCAs. Beca makes a deal to clear their name and to be reinstated if they win the World Championship of Acappella. Competition commentators John Smith (John Michael Higgins) and Gail Abernathy-McKadden-Feinberger (Elizabeth Banks) laugh at the idea, as America has never won because everyone hates the USA. College freshman Emily Junk (Hailee Steinfeld) is hoping to follow in the footsteps of her mother, Katherine (Futurama's Katey Sagal), by becoming a Bella herself. At orientation, she watches an Acappella performance by the Treblemakers, now led by Beca's boyfriend Jesse Swanson (Skylar Astin). Benjamin ""Benji"" Applebaum (Ben Platt), Jesse's best friend, overhears Emily and develops a crush on her. The Bellas learn that German powerhouse group Das Sound Machine (DSM) has replaced the Bellas on their victory tour. Also, Beca has started an internship at a recording studio, Residual Heat, and only Jesse, and later Fat Amy, know about it. Initially Beca only serves to bring coffees and run errands, but she later impresses her boss, rude but successful music producer Sammy (Keegan-Michael Key), when she helps with suggestions to improve a new Snoop Dogg Christmas album. Emily goes to the Bellas' sorority house to audition for them, singing her unfinished song ""Flashlight"". They are impressed and she succeeds in joining the Bellas. The Bellas meet DSM when they are performing at a car show. DSM, led by intimidating duo Pieter Krämer (Flula Borg) and Kommissar (Birgitte Hjort Sørensen), take delight in mocking the all-girl group. Later, the Bellas are invited to an exclusive riff-off, hosted by Sir Willups Brightlysmore (David Cross), against DSM. Also attending are the Treblemakers, the Tone Hangers (a group composed of former Treblemakers, including former Treblemakers leader Bumper Allen (Adam Devine), whom Amy is now dating), and the Green Bay Packers. The Bellas make it to the final two but end up losing to DSM in the final showdown after Emily panics and sings ""Flashlight"", and original songs are not accepted. The next day at the warmups, disaster strikes for the Bellas, ruining their chances of winning, when Cynthia Rose Adams (Ester Dean) has her hair catch fire after their incorporation of pyrotechnics in their performance. To regain harmony, Chloe takes them to a retreat led by former leader Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp). Beca starts a heated debate with Chloe over Chloe's obsession with winning Worlds, angrily accusing none of the other Bellas of thinking about their futures. Meanwhile, the Bellas realise that they may go their separate ways after graduation and sing together to regain harmony. Amy confesses that she broke up with Bumper, though she rows a boat across a lake to reach him, singing an apology song, they reconcile and restart their relationship. Beca's boss has been unimpressed with everything she has presented to him so far. To prove him wrong, Beca shows him the demo of Emily singing ""Flashlight"", which she hopes to produce. He expresses envy for their talent and says he looks forward to working with them. The senior Bellas head off to Copenhagen for the World Finals. Before the Bellas' performance, Emily and Benji share a kiss, officially becoming a couple. The Bellas' performance ends with a harmonised version of ""Flashlight"" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining them onstage. The Bellas win the championship and repair their damaged legacy. As the Bellas leave Barden, they give Emily a belated proper initiation. The end also sees Bumper performing ""All of Me"" on The Voice, for judges Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera , Pharrell Williams, and Blake Shelton; he chooses Christina Aguilera as his coach and makes her uncomfortable when he gives her a lengthy hug. Also starring Alexis Knapp as Stacie Conrad, Hana Mae Lee as Lilly Onakuramara, Chrissie Fit as Florencia ""Flo"" Fuentes, Kelley Jakle as Jessica Smith, Shelley Regner as Ashley Jones, Joe Lo Truglio as Tone Hangers, The Late Late Show's Reggie Watts as Tone Hangers, Kay Cannon as Newscaster Connie, Jimmy Kimmel as himself, and The View hosts Rosie O'Donnell and Rosie Perez as themselves. Kendrick as the new leader and the would-be music producer is good, Steinfeld is a very good addition to the gang, there is fun support from Devine, Cross and the many celebrity, but again it is Wilson who stands out with her big eccentric personality. It is another simple story, a disgraced acapella group wanting to restore their reputation by winning a big competition, it again has clichés and stereotypical characters, the script and pace has its ups and downs, but you cannot deny it will make you laugh, and the singing and soundtrack is great, an enjoyable musical comedy. Worth watching!"
" Lacking
",0.0,0.887,2020-12-10 00:00:00,6,"Like nearly all sequels the first is always the best! I enjoyed seeing the entire team back in action, It was nice having the quirky jokes and I always love the singing. But it was very lacking. The storyline was disappointing and it felt very forced instead of natural. They needed something more original instead of trying to redo the first movie. And German's? Really? I feel like that card is over played. And how do they just ""lose their sound"" They found it in the first movie after losing it. Couldn't they have come up with something more original for this movie?"
" While ""Pitch Perfect 1"" was adorable, funny and unexpected, this sequel is almost horrible
",0.7645,0.9609,2020-09-13 00:00:00,5,"The sequel doesn't have one central character. The 'Bellas' group here struggles to regain its reputation after an incident labeled by the press as 'Muffgate'. So, it is an ensemble comedy that mostly gives equal time to several of the 'Bellas' while Hailee Steinfeld's rookie introducing a whole new set of Bellas for ""Pitch Perfect 3"" to come. The star of the first film, Rebel Wilson is given more to do, but here she is too often a 'rebel' without a cause, as she lazily mumbles through some improvised shtick. Kendrick boyfriend Skylar Astin, the magic-obsessed Ben Platt and 'Bumper' are mostly minor and supportive characters. Ultimately, the plot is incredibly contrived, the humor falls flat, there are barely any characterizations. Basically, this one lacked the charm and originality of the first ""Pitch Perfect"". With such an arsenal of acting talent and popularity, it seems a shame the franchise moved into familiar sequel territory of shallow theatrics. If a second/third encore happens, it will be likely that the players will be returning to a much diminished audience. Pretty unnecessary movie.Rating: 5"
" Ruined by casual racism
",-0.7506,-0.906,2020-09-01 00:00:00,4,"This is a mildly entertaining sequel ruined for me by all of the casual racism and stereotyping.Obviously the rude roommate, butch, lesbian unable to keep her hands to herself and token weird Asian weren't enough so the addition of a Guatemalan lady whose only job is to spout things about being deported, being kidnapped.The commentators during the Bella's performances are awful too. Yes, I get they are purposely sexist etc. but it doesn't work at all for me.Also the 'original' song one of the new Bellas has written confused me as it sounds just like Titanium.There's a lot more wrong with it which I'm too lazy to go into, I won't be watching the next one."

" Great!
",0.6588,0.9882,2020-07-07 00:00:00,7,"Pitch Perfect two is a nice sequel to the first. It tells a great story and has more sweet friendship moments. The acting is good. Especially from Hailee Steinfield. I thought she was a perfect addition to the Bellas. The jokes are funny. The songs are alright but the last scene of the movie definitely won me over. Overall, this movie is not as great as the first one but it's still fun to watch."
" Anna Kendrick Wins Again
",0.5719,0.9551,2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"Becca and the rest of the Bellas are at it again, as they try to keep up with their Acapella. In this movie, there's trouble when a German acapella singing group from Copenhagen appears on the scene and they try to win the next prize at a competition there. Another Bella arrives, Hailee Steinfeld, named Emily who tries to
Sell a song she wrote. It's still a great movie. The singing is great. It's a laugh a minute and Anna Kendrick is still ACA-wonderful!"
" I just saw this one scene and it was enough
",0.0,-0.8555,2020-05-24 00:00:00,6,Ok I just want to know how this movie had a battle featuring 90's hip hop songs and yet allowed the winning team to use BBD Poison. That is NOT a hip hop song it is R&B and a major mistake that apparently no one caught. Hell Snoop is in the movie he could've told them.
" I love it !
",0.6696,0.9732,2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,"The first movie itself was great, the second one was even better as the third. They manage to keep the interest, they could make 10 movies and I'd watch them. The music again is great, the cast is amazing. I'd love to see a forth movie !"
" Funny and heartwarming musical masterpiece
",0.8779,0.9964,2020-05-05 00:00:00,10,"I don't know where to begin to describe how great this movie was. Second parts are usually just a shadow of the original, this one however took everything that was good in the first movie and made it better while leaving behind the not-so-good stuff (like the very USAish appeal to the grotesque like the vomiting scenes and such) The two obese women are still present but not in a way that disrupts the otherwise pleasant aesthetics of the film.Music performances dominate most of the screen time and they're truly a joy to watch, not only those of the Bellas but all the other groups as well, especially ""Das Sound Machine"", their German antagonists. It's not a comedy with a touch of music, it's a musical masterpiece.
The humor is another strong point, it should be a given for a comedy yet I hadn't watched a comedy that was genuinely funny in a long time. And the commentators deserve a special mention, they were already funny in the first movie but here they're on a whole new level.The movie advances at a beautifully smooth pacing, swinging between performances and all the subplots in a way that keeps you hooked up not wanting for it to ever end.
This is by far the best musical I've watched to this day. I'm not a huge fan of musicals but this one is different, I love the fact of having a lot of music in a movie in a way that is coherent to the real world instead of the somewhat cringy trope of having the characters spontaneously sing their emotions as if it was a totally normal thing to do.But whether you like musicals or not, please give this movie a try, you'll be glad you did. It has such an upbeat feeling to it that you'll be a happier person after you watch this."
" Nice one
",0.4215,0.6908,2020-04-02 00:00:00,10,After the success of the first movie I thought they would be able to afford instruments for this one. They still go alright without
" Perfect sequel
",0.5719,0.8658,2020-02-28 00:00:00,8,"I felt silly watching the first instalment of the franchise, then guilt then i thought forget you to the ney sayers.The first pitch perfect hit all the right notes.Surely a fluke, can't do it again can they?Yes they can, all back with new goals to fullfill. Its just fun and if you have a sense of humour and dont take everything to seriously you might just get this movie.From Elie Banks to Rebel Wilson, Anna Kendrick to the Green Bay Packers another brilliant cast delivers"
" There was no difference
",-0.296,0.8761,2019-12-27 00:00:00,7,There was no difference whatsoever but I'll give out praise at least it showed what the future meant to us. And gave out more of the Bellas doing actual performing and having them outshing the trebels. Don't bother watching the first just watch this one it's much better and upbeat and not to emotional
" Don't waste your time
",0.3252,0.1469,2019-10-14 00:00:00,1,"If you are into American dorm movies and have less than 20 years old you might like this. Terrible clichés you have seen it all since the 1980s and I definitely can't understand why this Acapella is a thing anyway: music without weight, without punch, without the band. Go see something else."

" a different take on musica
",0.0,0.8618,2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that if you keep working hard you can achieve what you deem is impossible. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Same Pitches, different feel.
",0.0,0.8437,2018-11-05 00:00:00,7,"While not as good as the first, it did well enough to remain entertaining and is better than most sequels in this genre tend to be. Biggest laughs are from Fat Amy (stair surfing anyone?) and has good feels throughout. Satisfied customer."

" IN THE MINEFIELD OF LIFE, YOU MUST BE PREPARED TO LOSE BOTH FEET
",-0.2023,0.9398,2018-04-20 00:00:00,10,"The sequel contains the same politically incorrect humor as the first one with announcer John (John Michael Higgins) frequently stepping over line. In this film Reba Wilson plays a larger role as Fat Amy and up and coming Hailee Steinfeld is added to the mix as song writer Emily. If you watch any preview, it will give away what little plot there is. This match is the ""Rocky IV"" as they go up against giants on their home turf.The film isn't exactly a remake, but follows the formula that made the first film a success. Anne Kendrick in a plaid skirt is enough to make me purchase the film. I will wait for the two pact with special features. It is a film that will convince you there is a song for every moment. It was also fun to watch the Green Bay Packers do a few tunes. If you loved the first one, this one is a no brainer.Guide: 1 f-bomb. Adult gestures and talk. No sex or nudity. Plenty of insults and stereotypes."
" We're Back Pitches!
",0.0,0.9582,2018-04-18 00:00:00,7,"Pitch Perfect 2, the sequel to Pitch Perfect is fun with more new music, new characters, and new laughs. However the second was not as good as the first it still stands out and satisfies. This time the Barden Bellas are seniors in college and embarrass themselves in front of the president causing them to be suspended from all a cappella activities until they sign up for an international a cappella competition where they are up against a capella groups from around the world. The movie is funny, loud, and shows that everyone has their ups and downs, but in the end you got to keep your head up.""You're Beca Mitchell! You're the big B.M! You're the most talented person I know. And I've met three of the Wiggles... intimately.""-Fat Amy, Pitch Perfect 2"
" highly disappointed
",-0.5256,-0.9046,2018-04-03 00:00:00,3,I really enjoyed the first movie but the second one is so dumb. I did not find it comedic at all. The actors weren't terrible I just think the overall plot sucks and that's what ruins the movie.
" A pretty good sequel
",0.7269,0.9587,2018-02-04 00:00:00,7,"I don't usually watch movies back to back, but having just finished the first movie, my family wanted to jump into the second. The characters are still good, and they do grow somewhat, but the music isn't as catchy as the first movie. I liked some of the other groups from around the world, particularly the German rivals, so that added a bit to the movie. Also fewer laughs than the first, but still pretty solid."
" Pitch... meh...

Still, Fat Amy is funny, as are the Green Bay Packers, and Keegan-Michael Key steals all of the scenes that he is in! Not ""perfect"", but o.k.!"
" Up-tempo feel-good fun
",0.5106,0.9883,2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"'Pitch Perfect 2' (rare in the fact that it doesn't have a sub-title!) is a decent sequel to the surprise 2012 hit comedy about a university a capella group. This film is obviously aimed at females and is going after a younger audience, introducing 18-year-old Emily (Steinfeld) into the mix now - probably to allow a third film in the series. However, these don't make it a bad film - still plenty of enjoyable moments throughout.There's probably less of a focus on the singing this time round, because - let's face it - a capella isn't really that exciting and can get old pretty quick. Especially with some of the rival teams - ""Das Sound Machine"" - and some of the terrible song choices (depending on your point-of-view, obviously). This is usually a good thing, as it gives Amy (Wilson) a chance to drop more quick-witted remarks and have more awkwardness with Bumper (DeVine) and even Becca (Kendrick) has some funny moments with her new boss (Keegan-Michael Key). But the best bits are still between the commentators - Elizabeth Banks (also her first time directing) & John Michael Higgins - plenty of hilarious lines and inappropriate comments. It's a little too long (almost two hours), has a few redundant scenes and is very predictable, but you're going to get what you expect - lots of laughs, some young-adult-what-does-the-future-hold musing and plenty of extras in a Louisiana field pretending it's a Danish festival! I wish the original song ('Flashlight') wasn't by Jessie J, but there's still some decent songs in it."
" 4 For Muisc, Zero For Movie
",0.0,0.841,2017-11-06 00:00:00,4,"Anna Kendrick is lovable, she is very sweet, very sexy and very cute. And yes, all of the main heroes have excellent voices. Then, the music is cool, there are snippets of numerous outstanding melodies and awesome vocal arrangements (although, way too often acapella suddenly turns into a full-blown instrumental backing, which left me quite puzzled and bemused). Other ladies are sweet and attractive, too. Well, that's it. As for the movie - million times you've seen this endless saga of past success-turned-fiasco-turned-newbie-turned- growing pains-turned-long way to the top-turned-in the end everything's gonna be alright. You will see nothing new here. What is really awful ( and I mean this - really really poor) is this absolutely low-level racial-cultural stereotyping of the worst kind. I was shocked and saw in utter amazement those shameful caricatures of certain peoples. Silly, in the weakest manner said. The rest is just a forgettable, passable, liquid junk of silliest kind. It all is underdeveloped and lacking real depth. It's not even realistic or funny, to say the least. Music here gets 4 points, as there are many bad and schlock schmaltzy tunes, but the movie deserves nothing. It is so badly bad."

" Aca - disappointing!
",-0.5411,0.9844,2017-06-22 00:00:00,5,"The sequel disappointed and missed the reason why the first one was so likable. I loved the first one! It was a refreshing musical (sort of) comedy with great characters, an interesting plot and an easy flow. The problem I have with the sequel is that it tried so hard to focus on every character and how they had developed over their college years, AND include new characters which fell flat (Hailee Steinfeld aka Emily). For one, Beca's story arc was that she was planning her future and that didn't exactly involve singing acapella for the rest of her life (unlike Brittany Snow aka Chloe). This really clashed with the main conflict of the film - redeeming their title and winning the main contest. If The main character feels indifferent to the main goal and the actions needed to be taken to achieve that goal, then the audience doesn't have much to root for and look forward to. Yes, Beca didn't like acapella in the first film as well, at First! But as the story progressed, so did her interest in acapella, her character development (from being judgmental towards the girls to becoming caring and loving, and the relationship with Jesse. The sequel just shows that it has become more of a habit than an actual pleasure, and Jesse is almost no where to be found! While we're on the main character, please just stick to the one instead of showcasing the life and struggles of every other. For example, it was unnecessary to follow Emily and her mom, as well as the relationship between Fat Amy and Bumper. Had they'd been toned down or just mentioned instead of showed for a lengthy few minutes it would've been far better.In spite all criticism, I do have to say that it was genuinely funny. The comedic part of this film did not disappoint whatsoever. Das Sound Machine were also interesting to watch, so props to that too.All in all, I believe this movie cannot compare to its prequel and I'm not sure what to expect from the third to follow, but I don't think I'll be buying a ticket to the cinema."
" ""This is what happens when you send girls to college....""
",0.0,0.7693,2017-06-20 00:00:00,6,"I was quite shocked when I saw and enjoyed ""Pitch Perfect"". After all, I am in my 50s and not exactly the demographic they were going for in the film. So, because of this, I then decided to try ""Pitch Perfect II""...and I did enjoy the film, though not quite as much as the first film. Much of it was due to Jessica Kendrick's character...who just didn't seem anything like the sweet lady from the first movie.The film begins with the a capella group at the very top of the world. They are performing on television at the Kennedy Center for the President! However, due to a horrific wardrobe malfunction, the group goes from the darlings of America to hated jerks. The film is about how the girls somehow manage to overcome this AND take on the dreaded German group, DSM at the international championship in Copenhagen.The best thing about the film was also a big plus in the first movie--the inane commentary by the two announcers (Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgens)...especially Higgens. As for Banks, it wasn't like she was a slouch, as she also directed and co-produced the movie! I also enjoyed seeing many of the familiar characters from the other films...aside from Kendricks', who seemed inexplicably self-centered and grouchy. For this reason alone, I think the original is a tad better....but they are both still very watchable."
" Bad sequel
",-0.5423,-0.9695,2017-04-06 00:00:00,6,"The magic and allure from the Pitch Perfect movie has gone in this poorly made sequel. Elizabeth Banks has poorly directed this film and should stick to acting after this mess. In fact, her involvement in the first and second film was unnecessary as well. She came across as an annoying judge whose opinion no one cared to hear. The film sees the Bellas take their competition to the world stage. The internal conflicts and issues the cast faced were artificial, shallow and just plain silly. They couldn't figure out what they were doing and who they fancied and the audience couldn't care less.The opposition was also very unimpressive and not funny. A German group who were quite frankly terrible on their own. The first movie showed great covers of classics but this one showed terrible covers of mostly terrible songs. Sadly they have made yet another movie which could possibly be worse than this one."
" Pitch Perfect 2
",0.5719,-0.8341,2017-03-06 00:00:00,4,'Pitch Perfect 2' was not as good as first. The musical numbers were not as memorable as the first. It simply wasn't as funny as the first. Anna Kendrick showed that she was a good singer though but the film lacked any real story and was just more annoying than it was funny. I have rated this film 2 stars.
" More Entertaining Than The First After Embracing Its Humor
",0.6478,0.9898,2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"When I watched the original ""Pitch Perfect"" a number of years ago, I was disappointed in an experience that I felt wasn't sure of itself. That movie struggled to figure out whether to be grounded in semi-serious character development or fully embrace the comedy. In this sequel, however, they choose to fully embrace the comedy, and at least for me that was a decision that led to more entertaining experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Pitch Perfect 2"" sees a return of the Borden Bellas...but only until they make themselves a national embarrassment after some ""exposure"" from Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Now, with the program about to be put on academic probation, it begins to fracture from within. Beca (Anna Kendrick) is spending just as much time on her own music career, while the routines just don't seem to be coming together like they used to. It takes freshman newcomer Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) to rally the troops and compete in the seemingly unwinnable ""Worlds"" competition featuring the dominant German squad.Even though I am nowhere near the target audience of this movie (30 year-old male), I found this one to be a pretty entertaining experience because of its willingness to embrace its own silly humor throughout. Instead of trying to ground this movie in any sense of reality, it goes all-out for the jokes and music and I think it fits the style of director Elizabeth Banks better. Once you think of it as a pure comedy, it makes it a lot easier to get through.Another great addition to the franchise was the Steinfeldt character, who breathes some new life and youthful exuberance into all proceedings. Without the new perspective given by her character, this could have been a pretty large repeat of the original. Steinfeldt can sing and act with equal measure (and both at a very high level), and is set up perfectly to be the star of subsequent sequels should Kendrick tire of the mantle.Overall, ""Pitch Perfect 2"" was more fun for me than the original. It doesn't try to sell itself as anything other than a comedy, the songs are catchy and fun (as usual), and the Steinfeld performance is mesmerizing. This genre will never be my favorite, but it didn't struggle to finish this film like I did the first one."
