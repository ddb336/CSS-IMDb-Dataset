" An Interesting Story
",0.4019,0.9853,2020-11-16 00:00:00,7,"While I am a fan of this director's works, this is not at all his best film. However, it was still enjoyable. There are some very interesting things about it. It starts out a bit slow, but it is nevertheless an interesting look at the struggles and lives of some immigrants. While watching this slow portion I got the feeling that some of the bits were very realistic and may have been based on life.Later in the film there is an action sequence. It feels very realistic at times but it looked like there was some CGI in there, which sort of took me out of the moment. I think CGI has its place in some of those big blockbuster type of films like Transformers, but with a very realistic movie like this, it almost feels like they added CGI to a documentary or something to make the explosions bigger.It's still an interesting story, however. It is not a typical story structure either, it feels like they found a new way to tell a story and it works. It may feel a bit odd for some people who watch it but I think that is only because they may be so used to seeing the traditional types of storytelling and this one is a bit different."

" Worst movie I have watched in a while
",-0.6249,-0.8823,2019-11-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie totally illustrate the gap between real world and these so called jury at the Cannes festival. It is like the movie was written by far write authors who think the suburban areas are ghetto with no police.But anyway, let's assume it is fiction. The plot is just miserable. Who got a janitor work without speaking the language. Where is the police? How this janitor can kill 20+ people with a machete and a screwdriver? Was it all a dream? Or a something for the bolywhood fans??Anyway it was a pure waste of time and I guess Cannes festival is just a meeting of bad authors judging horribles movies as it was art..."
" England is not paradise
",-0.5216,-0.9937,2019-02-03 00:00:00,5,"This film starts as a quite realistic piece about refugees in Paris and how live becomes shaped by crime and poverty.
But the last minutes of the film spoiled it for me. When the family finally arrive in London. Everything is fine. They live in a fine house, no more poverty und no crime. I mean seriously. This is London with the second highest murder rate in the EU (after Brussels) mostly involving people with no English origin (as victims and offenders). Refugees are forced to work below the minimum wages and to live in abendoned industrial sites. Where from time to time get burned because of no fire regulations. Even the officiel buildings for accommodation are not safe. Remember the burning skyscraper? They still do not know how many people died there. So England is a different country but the same s... So what the the message of this: Go to England so France has not to deal with refugees?"
" Believable
",0.0,0.1633,2018-11-17 00:00:00,8,The story and the acting is so good as to be believable. The immigrants trying to make it here are stunted by the crime gang they end up having to deal with. Good thriller with a bloody ending.

" Jacques Audiard (""A Prophet"") puts his own stamp on this interpretation of the old tale.
",0.0,-0.3182,2017-12-04 00:00:00,9,"Won the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. About an ex Tamil Tiger who goes to France after the catastrophic defeat. He is accompanied by a woman & child who pretend to be his wife & daughter. He has to adopt a new identity as he was one of the few leaders to survive. In France after moving around he gets a job as a caretaker in a block of apartments in an estate run by drugs gangs. He just wants a peaceful life but comes into conflict with the drug dealers. The warrior within has to emerge once moreThe story has been done before, in many Westerns; Ken Loach has done it in Scotland but Jacques Audiard (""A Prophet"") puts his own stamp on this interpretation of the old tale. Really moving. 9/10."
" Ending is fine too
",0.2023,0.9897,2017-11-17 00:00:00,9,"Some reviewers, though generally content with much of the film, have been a bit too harsh in judging the climax.For instance, this comment: //In the last shot Yalini runs her ring-less left hand through his hair affectionately. The whole scene seems fake.//My 2 cents about the conclusion part: (1) Hindus - both men and women - don't wear wedding rings. There are certain other visual differentiators, mainly for women (a silver ring worn on fingers next to toe on both legs in both North and South India, a rich vermillion on forehead in North India) but gradually declining in urbanised environments. Equally, urban Indians end up aping some Western habits such as celebrating Valentine's Day with card/gifts, blowing birthday candles and indeed, using rings - but, it's not a norm yet. It's perfectly fine to show them without rings and make one conclude they're happily married without any of them wearing ring.(2) Yalini, the leading lady, informs at least a couple of times her relatives being settled in England. While she lacks the exit velocity from Sri Lanka (wherefrom none of her England relatives could help her), once she reaches that housing estate, she does realise she's bound to the fledgling household more as a moral responsibility (to the girl and the man who made it happen) than as her preferred choice. Thus, it's quite natural for the last scene of the movie showing her will having prevailed - to make another fresh start, having just escaped another strife-prone zone, albeit of a different kind.I thought Audiard had done the last shot brilliant - instead of letting sign boards announce one's in England (or a tiring sight of flight landing Heathrow!), he just shows a car(well,a taxi) that drives on 'wrong' side of the road! Viewers are quickly forced to connect the dots - of Yalini's stated preference for England and indeed her attempted escape once - and conclude they're in England."
" Quietly Intense
",0.0772,0.9686,2017-07-22 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)Dheepan is a freedom fighter from Shi Lanka. He escapes from his life and the country's civil war by finding two strangers to pose as a family with him, a young woman and a young girl, and they flee to France not knowing the language. As the faux family tries to make roots, they are placed in a blighted housing development where a drug gangs live and operate. As they live like a family, emotions begin to emerge as they would in a normal family. Will the three of them give into their emotions or keep a distance until they can move on separately? This part of the story is told smartly though effective cinematography. Nothing flashy yet telling more through visuals than words. In conjunction with the faux family dynamic, is how the drug dealers interfere with their daily lives. Strife arises and one must remember Dheepan's background as a soldier; interesting things play out. This was a smart and gritty movie with really good acting."
" a good narration of our times
",0.4404,0.9186,2017-03-18 00:00:00,7,"I will try to make a brief analysis on storytelling, since it is the story and the storytelling that make this movie beautiful, probably brought the golden palm.That a film which shows the very low lives in France, has received the attention, that is also worth note-taking. The story is smoothly developed without too much exaggerations. Three people join each other to make a good picture for a proper refugee application, and through time they regain their confidence and become a real family, showing the other wreaks in the modern cities. It genuinely touches our today's world issues. It well documents for the future generations to explain our time. While in some places over the world like Sri Lanka, Ruanda, Syrian Kurdish regions mass killings take place, in the western urbans we have gangs and other crimes to worry. Dheepan is not depicting freaky situations like sexual harassment, very rich lives contrasted with the very poor life of the protagonist ( A cliché in a luxury restaurant would have been disturbing in the movie) . Also, usually in that kind of lives you could see many sexual, material and power abuses. But the movie do not touch these kind of elements, which help you focus on other elements in the movie. Probably much people after the movie will feel the life of the ""family"" very decent and proud and appreciate the efforts of receiving countries."
" Excellent filming and acting, a thoughtful and exciting film.
",0.8591,-0.9098,2017-02-19 00:00:00,9,"Well done! Filmography was often beautiful with a touch of surrealism. Plot and characters have plenty of layers. The complexities of escaping a warring home place so different from the one you land in, not understanding what they say, or why. The lead characters were complex and gripping, especially the woman. At the end I had to ask, what does it mean? The mixing of the terror, violence, and ludicrousness of the war at home and the drug gangster war. Unusual emotional depth in a film, and still leave you hopeful."
" Powerful and disturbing - though I get why some won't like it
",-0.3839,-0.9904,2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Note: I have tried to write only in very vague terms about the film's concluding half hour, and I think I have avoided 'spoilers', but there's no way to discuss the film without indicating in a general way how it evolves. I knew nothing about the film's story arc when I saw it, and I think that was a plus for my experience, so read forward at your own emotional risk.Not everyone responded enthusiastically to Jacques Audiard's confusing and disturbing film. It tells of a 'family' of war refugees escaping from Sri Lanka to France. In reality none of the three in the 'family' even knew each other in Sri Lanka, but now that they've used the lie to escape with their lives, they have to keep the story up. This leads to odd, sad and fascinating dynamics. There's Dheepan – a mid 30s ex soldier suffering from PTSD. Yalini is his much younger 'wife', for whom playing family, especially 'mother' is a painful and confusing prison when she dreams of a chance to become her own person. And 'their' child is a bright, sweet 9 year old orphan who was dragged into this situation without anyone asking her permission or caring how she felt. Now the three have to figure out how to survive in a violent and poverty stricken French housing development riddled with drug dealers. It's better than where they were, but far from the haven they might have imagined. Up to this point in the story there's no question the film is a powerful and sad human tale. Almost everyone has responded to both the situation and the excellent performances. But then there's a sudden odd and violent series of twists in the last half hour, which culminate in some extremely enigmatic final images that resist neat interpretation. These are what has caused much of the mixed reaction to the film. And I can certainly understand and even empathize with those who feel the film betrays it's first 2 acts to go off in a skewed direction that defies emotional logic. But for me, it worked. There was something dream-like for me about the whole film that allowed a sudden veering into a surreal nightmare – as sometimes happens in dreams. And something satisfying about going deeper into the specific nightmare that belongs to a tortured man who killed and watched death for years as a soldier. It may not be satisfying in a conventional sense, but it sure as hell shook me out of any more common, simple 'isn't that awful' reaction to our character's plight and pushed me into deeper thought and emotion about class, violence, the scars we carry, and what we try to hide behind our masks as we fit in to societies that can be cruel and uninterested in those at the bottom of the ladder – immigrant or local."
