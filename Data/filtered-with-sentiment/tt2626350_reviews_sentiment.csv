" Best Step Up movie
",0.6369,0.9052,2021-03-26 00:00:00,9,"Loved the dancing in this movie. None of the movies had a great plot, but step up 4 & 5 had the best dancing, which is what I want from a dance movie."
" Step up All in
",0.0,0.9793,2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,"Step up: all inA film about street dance. The genres of the film are music, love, dance and drama. It was filmed with director Trish Siein 2014. The actors Ryan Guzman in the role of Sean, Briana Evigan in the role of Andi and Adam G. Sevani in the role of Moose play the 3 leading roles of the fifth part of the Step up series.The dance crew the Mob is out of luck in L.A. and has no more chance to earn money. The members of the dance group have had enough and go back to their home town to continue there. Only the crew leader Sean gives his dream of earning money with dancing and stays in L.A. After a hard time without a real place to stay and without money, he contacts Moose, an old friend of his and a super street dancer who has given up on this for his girlfriend. Sean lives for a while with Moose's grandparents in the dance school and helps out there as a craftsman. After a while, Sean sees a commercial for The Vortex and sees it as his chance to make money by dancing. The Vortex is a huge dance show where the winning crew gets a lot of money and a free stay in L.A. The only problem Sean has is that he no longer has a crew. He's starting a new crew with Moose and his old friends. They call themselves LMNTRIX and plan to take part in the Vortex. You have to see for yourself what will happen to Sean and his new Crew.My opinion on the film is that it is wonderful. The characters and the relationships between them are well represented, plus the actors' fantastic acting and dancing skills. The music and the dances are just amazing and extremely difficult to master, but the actors did it perfectly and probably exceeded it.In the end, I think you should watch the entire step up series, especially the last part of the series. I rate the film 9.5 stars out of 10."
" I loved it

" Such a load of...

" Loved the dancing; but that is about it
",0.3506,0.2868,2019-07-08 00:00:00,6,"First in 'Revolution' Eddy and The Mob completely ignore the fact that Emily went against her own father to help The Mob and instead torpedo her relationships with both her father and Sean (even though it shouldn't have really affected her relationship with Sean given he had absolutely nothing to do with what The Mob did).Now in 'All In' they take their ignorance to the next level, this time with a side of hypocrisy. When Sean runs into The Mob at the Vegas competition, they are completely ignorant towards him for starting a new crew instead of calling them. Really?!?! How is them entering a crew without calling Sean any different? And let's not forget they are the ones who abandoned Sean in the first place.Even though she can definitely dance, I didn't find Andie particularly likeable. Jasper is grating on the nerves with his gangsta-wannabe attitude, Chad is so annoying, and Alexxa Brava is just a little too Effie-like.Moose of course is lovable as always, and while Sean is admittedly a little arrogant at times, Ryan Guzman is once again enjoyable to watch. For not being a professional dancer, he holds his own with those in the movie who are."
" A good dance movie
",0.4404,0.9842,2017-09-08 00:00:00,7,"Abandoned by his dance crew, Sean quickly assembles a new one with the help of a close friend in order to compete in a reality show called ""The Vortex"", which will reward its winner with a three year contract. Things won't prove to be easy as the recent past will come to haunt him while his mentality will tend to jeopardize his relation with the girl he likes. Add up a fishy conquest to the picture and you get a movie which excels through music and dance but fails to provide a good plot or a serious romance story. It's simply too clich√© and too predictable to be a good story and too superficial in terms of romance. If you're looking for cool dance moves and entertaining music, this is a movie for you, if you want anything else, look elsewhere."
