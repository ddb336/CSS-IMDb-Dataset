" I feel woody Allen over the place
",0.0,0.7902,2021-01-18 00:00:00,10,The plot and story-line is awesome and I felt that Woody Allen is the writer and director somehow. Victor did a good job.Bérénice Marlohe acting is great in a different way she is not a well recognized actress but she is different in every way from her face expression to her way of talking.definitely worth to watch.

The ethics of the viewer were put under strain, because we all know life is not so simple as the woman made out. Also is hard to believe she had not been in love before. Would the husband really have hit the boy, would that be common assult? Nice that the film resolved itself and had a fairly happy ending, and was nearly a feel good film"
" A thought provoking piece of art
",-0.2023,0.9985,2019-10-04 00:00:00,9,"From 5 to 7
This romantic movie was written and directed by Victor Levin who has experience making film of this genre with movies such as ""Destination wedding"" and ""My sassy girl"" which were applauded by the audience. Its leading actors are Anton Yelchin and Berenice Marlohe. Two well-known actors in the world of films. The first one is a famous Russian-American actor who is renowned due to his interpretation of Pavel Checov in the Star-trek films, and the second one is the pretty actress who played the character of Severine in the famous movie ""James bond: skyfall"".
This arresting film shows a different perspective of love, a more freedom way of seeing it. The protagonist called Brian Bloom is a writer who hasn't have the chance to publish anyone of his stories because he doesn't have an editor who trusted in his art. For this reason and many other problems in his life, he has been feeling depressed till he meets a beautiful woman who is smoking a cigarette in the street in his break-time. He gets near of Arielle Pierpont, the woman who is smoking, and have a conversation with her. The man falls in love with her from the very beginning. So, they meet each other and starts a love relationship, but not a common one. They only can be lovers from 5 to 7.
This movie makes me reflect on the idea that I have about love. Before watching this movie, my perspective about love was monogamous without any doubts and I was totally against of those people who are polyamorous. But this movie puts on consideration that polyamory is another perspective of love and it is okay as well as monogamy. So, this are some of the questions that I made myself while I was watching ""5 to 7"": ""what happens if not just one person who makes you feel love? Is there any possibility to love more than one person? Of course, I haven't found the answers of those questions because I need to experience real situations. But what matters is that this movie was the starting point of a wide view about love.
I really recommend ""5 to 7"" because not only it is a catching movie, but also it is a thought provoking one. You will enjoy this movie because the main characters are well performed and they act as if there were a real passionate love between them. So, I promised that you are going to like this piece of romantic art."

I am not sure I would call it a romantic comedy as it was very intense throughout. There were a few laughing moments but not a lot. But it was very romantic. So well acted and written. Glenn Close and Frank Langella were a surprise as Brian Blooms parents. They were so good but I shouldn't be surprised as they are great actors. The whole cast was outstanding. Kudos to the writer/director Victor Levin.

" 5-7 at The New Yorker
",0.0,0.9729,2018-11-03 00:00:00,7,"All my life I've always wanted to a be writer or a designer for The New Yorker Magazine. I've been a collector of the magazines since the age of 11. The 9/11 issue was my first issue. I am now 28 and I still collect them. I'm a graphic designer for MLB and my dreams was/is to contribute to The New York in some sort of way. Born and raised in New York City, there was a lot of similarities to the character of Mr. Bloom. What I gained from this movie is to never give up on your goals and always remember what got you where you are today. And where you want to be. It's a great love story and it proves that you can love more than one person at a time, there's many levels of love. Everything happens for a reason, and it's not where you are, it's who you are with.Inspired to start writing my own mermaid story..."
" New York City's like a Graveyard...
",0.3612,0.9564,2018-08-26 00:00:00,4,"There is really no depth in the 2 main characters. No flaws are shown to make me connect to them. They are all too perfect. The guy doesn't even need to work. He can choose when he wants to continue writing without financial problems. His inner poetic and prosaic thoughts are boring and not original. I don't understand how he could have become famous in the end. The music is just mediocre noise. Actually this movie is kind of depressing that if a ""perfect love"" happened to a person in real life, it would be such a shallow, unconnected experience. The woman has no charisma although she has all traits of beauty. She would be a statue in the living room, an idea of life and love without bearing true personality and substance. What I liked best was the dialogue of the writer's parents. This movie is like eating dry bread for one week."
" Stilted, stupid, boring

" Witty funny and awkward
",0.3182,0.6724,2018-06-19 00:00:00,7,"This original premise is executed funnily and poetically, with witty dialogue that carries no shame in getting hilariously awkward. 
Cinematography does however clip this movies wings, dulling things constantly. A completely static shot with barely any camera playing. I appreciate it symbolises the relationship and is paired with the benches. But it does get boring and repetitive fast, ignoring potential opportunities and at some times obliterating emotional peaks. Characters and script, do however standout enough for me ro keep this movie alive, being both passionate and beloving. With believable performances on both counter parts. 
7/10"
" Fantastic writing; casting less than worthy of the writer
",0.7369,0.9969,2018-06-04 00:00:00,7,"I loved almost every word of this script. With so much other great writing under his belt, I'm not sure how Victor Levin is able to remain in his skin. Even the ordinary words are placed like jewels in the sky. Most of the voice-over narrative read like a great literary novel, as it should. Certain other parts were also beyond well-done, for instance, the ""good-bye"" letter from Arielle. I wouldn't change a word.However, the casting did not reach to touch what the words were attempting to make flesh. The main character, Brian Bloom, was too young or too underwhelming or too lacking in passion to meet the expectations and hopes I had for his character; the love interets, Arielle Pierpont, was too predictable of a classic, standard-issue French lover to be believed as someone who would throw her entire life away, to give her heart to such a young man. Both needed something extra or different to create the needed chemistry for them to be sympathetic to the viewer--Brian to be more outwardly passionate and perhaps mature, Arielle to be covertly needier and quirkier than a collected dipomat's wife might be. I stayed with them in their affair, but more for what I had hoped for them than what they actually shared. For any romantic movie, the lovers must match. For this film, the lovers needed not just match, but create an epic type of passion that drags the viewer in an causes the viewer to be just as heartbroken, just as destroyed as the characters themselves. And, yes, the parting destroyed him and her both. Yes, time and a more mature view of life gave them both the ability to embrace the gift they had for that moment of time. But that gratitude could have been much greater if the on-screen passion of the actors and the desire of the characters themselves were also splashed across the screen with a little more of a Jackson Pollack type of abandon. 'If the casting and direction were a bit more senstive, this could have been another Dr. Zhivago but with less production costs.Would I watch it again? Sure! But only if it were a rainy day, I had plenty of popcorn, and I could share it with a woman I had a secret crush on."
" Not very realistic

Sadly, Yelchin came off as being somewhat awkward in this somewhat implausible romance. Perhaps people living in such circles act this way, but just seemed a bit unrealistic."
" Cliché after cliché
",0.0,0.9152,2018-01-14 00:00:00,4,"It'd be a great movie if it's done by a rich kid from a film school with lots of money to hire these actors. A great example to show that putting nice faces and landscapes together won't make a good movie. The lines are too predictable, and the visual is just mediocre (tell me it's all shot with an iPhone). I asked why it's such a self indulging masturbation. And the answer is here (on iMDb). Directed by the writer. Too much ego. No one probably wanted to direct it or be kind to let him know it's a total crap."

" heartfelt love story, witty and engaging, that will hit you right in the feels
",0.8779,0.9955,2017-09-25 00:00:00,10,"In a perfect mix of French ""amour"" and American fast-track filming, enter 5 to 7, a good old love story that actually focus on love rather than crazy, life-changing situations. You will laugh, but not feel like you are in a cheap comedy. You will smile, but only because you feel the characters happiness. You will sometimes feel stunned, sad, and a slight discomfort, and all of that is just going to make you want to see more and more.At some point, you might be inclined to try and guess what is going to happen, but whether you see things coming or not, you will be too busy enjoying this amazing, feeling-packed movie, like nothing you have seen, at least not in the past ten years. The cast choice is just great, the script is simple, yet powerful and modern. You may just learn a thing or two about either culture, but mostly, you will feel all kinds of stuff. Maybe I'm just a sucker for a good romance; maybe I got a bit weary of today's blockbusters; but I can tell you that I started watching this unintentionally on the TV, and I immediately knew it was going to be a great and powerful movie, with a strong message... and Arielle will make sure you know she has great teeth!"
" Flat and weirdly pointless
",-0.296,0.9868,2017-06-14 00:00:00,6,"You expect a romance movie to have something to say about romance, the idea of romance or love. And while this movie has a lot of cheesy dialogue that would point in that direction, it ultimately has nothing to say. And when a romance movie has nothing to say about romance, you would typically expect to see a kind of chemistry that draws you in. And while the female lead attempts to portray this pretty well, the male lead appears to have no idea that his character is in a romance, let alone is in love. And when a movie like this has nothing to say about romance, and has precious little chemistry between the leads, you would at least expect it to have a smart script. Alas, the dialogue leads from one laughably clichéd line to another. The weirdly pointless bench taglines portrayed as ""the best writing in NYC"" should give us a clue about where the script is going and how the narrative will play out.Not to say this movie isn't worthwhile in other ways. The character of Jane, the editor, may be the only 3-dimensional one here, and she completely takes over many of the scenes -- of the precious few she's in. Her absence is sorely noticeable when she's not there. The male lead's parents, while not quite as fleshed out as we'd like, are nevertheless extremely enjoyable. The story itself is nothing special -- it plays out as melodrama (stock characters in a situation that forces them to act in stock ways) which isn't necessarily bad if it's well done, but it just isn't.Something else to mention about the story: The universe in which this story exists is one that rewards and ultimately revolves around complete sincerity. This is intensely aggravating, not just because it makes the whole thing unrealistic, but also as it implies that the people here have no interior lives. That the only thing that matters is what they have chosen to do in a completely sincere manner. That is, the important thing is not who they are, but what they do. For a purportedly delicate character study, this is a weird narrative choice.There is one piece of irony that is probably not intentional, but which completely destroys any integrity this movie may have had at one point, and the following isn't a spoiler. The line ""What would you do for love?"" is intended to apply only to the woman and her life decisions, but it ultimately applies to the man as well. Because his own implicit answer to this question is what leads this movie to go into the depths of self-indulgent pretension. All of which could be forgiven if any of the other faults mentioned above were also addressed."
" Dialogues, a lost art rediscovered.
",-0.3182,0.7473,2017-04-14 00:00:00,9,"I had no idea what a great movie this would be. Or how good Anton Yelchin actually (already) was, as an actor. This is the best romantic movie that I've seen for several years, with incredible dialogues. It is so rich, in so many ways, combining wisdom, life experience and humor. Nothing but love for this one."
" The most extraordinary story about love
",0.6369,0.8871,2017-03-31 00:00:00,10,"I began this movie, knowing little of what awaited me. Many movies you watch in life are movies that just fleet by, without having an impact on your view of life, of love, of what's important to you. This movie was and remains different. It is a movie that will challenge your idea of life and of love foremost. If you are prepared for this, then I strongly advice you to watch this movie. It was gripping without its like. I have never been this moved by a movie, and it will probably take a long time for me to find a movie of its like. 10/10"
" Not Your Typical Love Story...
",-0.5216,0.9722,2017-03-28 00:00:00,9,"The writing, acting, dialogue and cinematography of 5 to 7 are all nearly perfect. There isn't really anything negative to point out, however there is definitely one thing that makes this story come alive...Anton Yelchin.This film is about a struggling writer, who meets and has an affair with a woman married to a French diplomat. They meet from 5pm-7pm, the time after work, but before returning home for the evening. It's a French thing...This is not another Nicholas Sparks adaptation, but a genuine story of love and morality. Much of the film shows the inner conflict of a man torn between his feelings for a woman and his own moral and ethical convictions. It's definitely worth a watch.I would highly recommend ANY movie that Anton Yelchin is in. He was not only a great actor, but he really breathed life into every film he worked on. If you have not seen his films, you should definitely try them. Not all are serious (Fright Night), but all are entertaining and manage to draw you in (Charlie Bartlett)."
" Soothing & peaceful romantic movie
",0.802,0.9981,2017-03-28 00:00:00,9,Lately I watched 5 to 7 movie on Netflix. I was very tired and was looking for a movie to relax and enjoy dinner time before I go to sleep. And 5 to 7 played its role very well in that respect. It's a perfect movie for such need. As you can see in the trailer it is a story based on very unusual idea of relationship based on two hour meeting per day. Lot of questions comes into your mind while watching this movie making you deny this idea presented in the here but remember that this is just a story telling. And this movie has this consistent soothing and loving tone which keep suppressing those thoughts and make you enjoy the story. Anton & Bérénice played the leading characters amazingly. Anton played a role of young American writer fighting to understand and be part of this unusual relationship. He was expected to be a harmless person in love and trying to be as ethical as possible. Bérénice played a role of older married french women who is charming enough to make you forget about everything and just be in love with her. Their costumes were chosen very nicely to give this movie both french & American touch. Some scenes shows you the dreamy lights of love in a city. Last but not the least this movie also capture the joy of friendship through an unrealistic character. Overall it was a perfectly balanced movie to watch beside your loved ones and I really enjoyed it.
" Evening love
",0.6369,0.9623,2017-03-28 00:00:00,5,"5 to 7 although set in America is a continental European inspired love story. Brian (Anton Yelchin) a 24 years old would be writer in New York reliant on his parents for financial help falls for Arielle (Berenice Marlohe) an older, beautiful and sophisticated Frenchwoman married to an even older French diplomat. She is also a mother of two children.Obviously as Arielle and Valery are French, they take a broad approach to extramarital sex. Valery himself has a girlfriend and actually invites Brian to dinner where they all meet each other and tells him that he is prepared to put up with Brian as long as they have sex between 5.00 pm to 7.00 pm.Of course young Brian falls in love with Arielle but the struggling would be writer has nothing to offer her. Valery has money and status.If this was shot in France and made in French, this would had been a hit. It does have an understated, sophisticated sensibility and maybe a younger Woody Allen directing could had pulled it off. There is a comedic spark provided by Glenn Close and Frank Langella that the rest of the cast cannot match."
" an absolutely stunning movie
",0.4391,0.9421,2017-03-21 00:00:00,10,Without spoiling how the movie ends.... the last 5 minutes of it are worth watching over and over. What starts as a chance meeting of two people evolves into something that becomes much more of a love story than one can imagine. The ending was such a lovely twist to a story that was beautifully written and acted.
" Old ideas and painfully mediocre writing meet painfully drab acting
",-0.7783,-0.6317,2017-02-18 00:00:00,5,"5 to 7 (2014)Oh, right, this drip of a leading male glances across the street and sees a gorgeous girl and he wanders over and it turns out she's just possibly open to having an affair with him, but only from 5 to 7 each weekday because, you realize, she's married.The movie takes this all quite seriously in a slightly stylized version of a Linklater film, filled with ordinary conversation as we get to know these two leads. This puts a lot of pressure on the writing, which is weak—the dialog is stilted and the overall narrative idea is stale. The addition of older (better) actors later (Close and Langella) is of course helpful, but I still find the plot forced. I mean, an open marriage is an old and fertile idea for movies and literature (and life). But it can't just be laid out as if we've never encountered it before.Can we say this is all artfully on purpose? That it's a style to appear a little lame all along, not reaching too high, making it ordinary? Maybe, but not here, not for me. A miserable experience."
" What a Bore...

This picture, however, I found to be incredibly boring. Taken in by the 7.1 rating, I thought I'd give it a try and stuck with it all the way through to see if anything happened to justify that score. Afraid not. Berenice Marlohe is astonishingly good looking, but the faultless character she plays is more annoying than attractive. As for Anton Yelchin, I have doubts that he could have made his sad faced character any less interesting. The story is not really all that original and is actually pretty sappy; writer/director Victor Levin does not hesitate to ""cue the strings"" to make sure that sap keeps flowing. As I said, maybe there's something wrong with me - plenty of reviewers thought the movie was great. Maybe you will too, who knows..."

It was filmed beautifully, the characters were amazing the relationship between anton and Bérénice I found mesmerizing, the fact that she at the time of the films release was 35 and anton 25 a ten year age difference and on screen you could see she was slightly more of an older woman than him with his young boyish looks anyway but I think it made the film for me a 30 year old exciting. I mean who wouldn't want a beautiful woman like that loving you in such a way as was shown in this great movie. I loved the ending I loved the last 10 min build up to the ending. I love it was based around this boys dream of being a writer I loved the Concept shown near the end when he is reading the letter it shows you Bérénice noticing anton first in the steet really changes the way I saw the movie as the beginning you are led to believe that he spotted her first when that wasn't the case and I think this was shown in a brilliant way at the very right time in the movie, she had already seen him and was daydreaming about him just before he saw her and daydreamed about her before approaching and I just that a touching moment in this movie . The dad of anton played his part great as did the wife but he added something a tad more special to his role for me . It had touches of the movie before sunrise in their for me not the same movie but certain elements. Anyway if you like a different kind of basic love story and one with fantastic acting on both the main characters parts then this is an absolute must . Rip to the late anton yelchin."
