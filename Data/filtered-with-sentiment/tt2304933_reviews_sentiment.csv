",0.7543,0.177,2021-04-09 00:00:00,6,"The first 30 minutes are really good. I'd say they failed to keep the quality up beyond that. It's like running a marathon and gassing out after mile 8. They should have kept it adult level, but rather it got a little cheesy making it a kid-level PG-ish feel. All that being said, there was still enough to keep my attention to finish up."

",0.6124,0.0,2021-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Forget about the aliens... this movie shows you the impact on society if people are induced with fear and suspicion... it show us humans how we really are...
what we humans are capable of doing when we are scared or made believe we are under threat from an enemy... especially when everyone has a gun...From this point of view it is an interesting story... that makes you wonder what you would do in a given circumstance... ""love is just a trick""?

" Ridiculous movie for preteenagers

" If you can suspend your disbelieve it's pretty decent
",-0.0772,0.9987,2021-02-12 00:00:00,7,"Quite honestly it's far superior to most YA book movies. It's far superior to divergent etc for example.The problem is that the plot is full of holes and makes little sense. But the acting is surprisingly good. Again far superior to the average YA movie. The obligatory romance was done pretty well. Although the age difference is a bit creepy. This is something a lot of YA books / movies do. Take a 16yo girl protagonist and have some 25yo dude be one of the love interests. They hinted at a love triangle for the next movie (which obviously isn't happening) which is dumb. Why does every movie targeting YA and middle aged women need a love triangle. It's a giant pet peeve of mine. The romance was actually pretty well done and developed, eventhough the guy was much older and had a ""love on first sight"" then stalker type real going on.The action and characters were ok. The story was ok if you don't mind how nonsensical the aliens are, and how they can wipe out humanity in a million different and much easier ways. How their technology is centuries if not millennia more advanced then ours and still their methods are antiquated etc. If you can look past that it's actually pretty entertaining. The twists can be seen from a mile away.Chloe was great. Although she looks so young that the romance part felt creepier.
Kinda wish they made a second movie to continue the story. I guess this one didn't sell. I mean I had never heard of it before and I love sci fi, dystopias and post apocalyptic stuff (reason why I watched it despite my aversion to YA stuff). I saw it on Netflix and out it on thinking even if it wasn't good it might be so bad it's funny or good. It was decent overall..maybe it's the alcohol making it better, idk"

We also have another rom-com, another thriller, another drama, and quite frankly, there have to be many ""The Room"" kind of movies out there, but this one sure as not-too-bad-an-expletive isn't it.People with any kind of sense get right from the get go when the kids are taken to the military base first that something's wrong, but maybe they don't want to hear it, like me. Did I see it? Yes, I did, but you have to really see it to really see it for sure. Even when you're 100% sure, it greatly adds to the suspense and the fact that you really don't know who you can trust anymore is played out really well with an excellent twist.Every little bit of the movie is intense and it simply doesn't stop. The mere idea that there's anything wrong with this movie is nuts. People scoring this movie low grades lie about the acting, the story, and the directing. If you feel you have seen too many post-apocalyptic movies, I understand if you were to only give it an 8 out of 10, because you feel it lacks originality.The point is that we now have the technology to make these movies and as such people are going to make as many of them as they make rom-coms and all kinds of other stuff. Complaining about that is like complaining about the number of super-hero comics. Yes, the number of them is insane.The point is that you now get to pick the one you most likely would enjoy watching. If you don't want to see another post-apocalyptic style movie, maybe you should watch a rom-com instead. Hidden exclamation mark."

beside the idea of the movie, the end is open somehow and let you want to see more, it's like they closed the movie at critical point. and yet there is critical question the movie didn't answered like how the other get to the army from first place while it's the most defensive place, why did the three rest of the family left their home for refugee camp while it's obvious as it's mentioned in the movie they are an obvious target
what's left is mentioning that anything spoked about above doesn't necessarily what I believe in or what I support, it's just pure rating outside personal belief"
" Good entertainment

" Outstanding Not
",0.6124,-0.4269,2020-08-08 00:00:00,6,Another minor entry in the whole YA dystopian glut of films that came after and never match The Hunger Games. There are some interesting ideas in the movie but so much apocalyptic stuff seems suddenly more relevant in 2020. The actual 5 waves are the best part. This film does not engage the heart as this genre of film must - you must feel for the character and the actress never convinces. The whole alien invasion thing -🤷‍♂️
" No plot, NO Meaning, Complete waste of time! MUST AVOID AT ALL COSTS

I legit feel worse after i watched the movie, not because something happened in the movie, nah. It's because i wasted 2hours of my life on this trash. it's so bad i wish i've never watched it in the first place. This type of movie should be realistically graded under 3 (knowing someone will give pity and give it 2/3 out of 10 but not me, this type of movie doesn't even deserve pity."

" Same Rubbish, Different Title
",0.0,-0.7801,2020-05-28 00:00:00,2,"It finally picks up a bit at the finale, when all of the predictable plot twists have played out (besides the obligatory set-up for a sequel), after we've come to accept the lousy CGI and bad acting, if not the grating score, and when the dialogue is kept to a relative minimum for some race-against-time action. The climax at the military base was about the one time I wasn't either laughing at how bad ""The 5th Wave"" is or fighting the urge to turn away in disgust at its even worse moments. I fail to appreciate how anyone enjoys this young adult fiction tripe. The writing is atrocious. Formulaic and telegraphed plot twists. Part of the narrative always involves children being trained for some sort of militaristic sport. Always a love triangle or two. Usually one of the boys is conflicted about which side to join--but, of course, always picks the one the girl is on. There's no nuance or subtlety to the conflict, or the acting, either. Never is. Here, it's an alien invasion. Indeed, there's no nuance or subtlety to anything in these movies. Teenage characters either wear their emotions on their sleeves or they shout them. Dialogue is obnoxious. ""Love isn't a trick."" Besides the finale, my favorite scene was when they took the kid brother away on a bus. Most of his lines consist of him repeatedly yelling his sister's name. It was pissing me off, and I was glad to be rid of him for a while.Have you seen ""The Hunger Games"" movies, the ""Divergent"" series, ""The Maze Runner"" ones, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" (2019)? Same rubbish. Sure, it's executed worse this time around, but it's always the same. I recommend the 1956 and 1978 ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" if you want to see films where aliens assume human shape, as well as writing that knows how to tease out the promise of such a concept.P.S. I don't know what's up with the poster for ""Big Fish"" (2003) in the movie. I remember nothing about that Tim Burton feature, although I know I saw it, because I wrote a review on it. Perhaps, ""The 5th Wave"" is right--there is hope. Someday, I will forget this travesty, too."
" Started off good...
",0.0,-0.4487,2020-05-23 00:00:00,5,"...but the middle got bad and the end fell off the cliff.Only one parent is going to complain about being separated from their children??? Really???Then, the main character's parent allows his two children to go with the army by themselves. Only a minor concern is raised.The army tells the adults that the aliens can look like anyone. Doesn't anyone question if the army people are actually aliens?""Too much eye makeup emo girl"" is all tough, but she's the first one to bail out. Ugh!So...how do the aliens tell themselves from humans? How can humans (really) tell who is an alien? What happened to most of the kids? Why did the army guy disregard the kids at the end? How is a small squad of kids expected to defeat the aliens. Too many questions. I suppose they left it open for a sequel.This was an OK movie that could have been a lot better!"

" Chloe Grace Moretz does a spirited portrayal in a YA sci-fi dystopian drama flick
",0.6249,-0.4722,2020-05-11 00:00:00,6,"Chloe Grace Moretz does a spirited portrayal of a teenage girl forced to fend for herself and fight for her life in a post-apocalyptic world decimated by succeeding worldwide catastrophes and destruction. Defending herself from alien brutality and human betrayal. Romance develops in the midst of tragedy, all the while trying to find her missing brother. As a YA sci-fi drama flick, it is decent enough. As a full scale sci-fi dystopian drama acted by a young cast, it doesn't really stand up to scrutiny or depth of analysis. The film story doesn't faithfully follow that of the original book, but that is probably a good thing as the book wouldn't transfer to the screen visually due to internal character dialogue. If you lower your expectations based on past teen sci-fi dramas, then you can watch this with a measure of suspension of belief.
I originally rated this film a good 8/10, based on Chloe Grace Moretz carrying the film, as I like her spiky teenage kiss-ass (pun intended) girl characters. Looking back now I have revised my rating after taking a more critical and analytical view of it. In part, due to the overwhelmingly low, negative ratings and reviews for this movie. I don't make a habit of following the mob, but they aren't all wrong in their assessment of this movie. Rating is now 6/10."

However, Cassie's hair maintains its voluminous, wavy texture throughout the movie, no matter how much life, injury, and the elements get to her, despite it being obvious that it needs a lot of hair styling to make it look that way. If you are able see past that, you will probably enjoy the movie. I couldn't."
" On the verge of being good
",0.4404,0.9504,2020-04-22 00:00:00,5,"I love Young Adult Dystopian movies and novels, and I love Chloe Moretz. So what's not to enjoy about this movie, I thought?The premise of aliens wiping out mankind in waves, decimating it one by one and using humans against each other was interesting enough. I can even get on board with the idea that since minors are more easily manipulated, the aliens targeted them to turn on each other without their knowledge. But the execution was really flawed in my view, as I'll explain below.First of all, this entire film moved ahead at such a brisk pace that it was difficult to follow what was what at times, and how quickly characters developed into full-fledged kill machines without much reservation. (It would take more than to dangle a necklace in front of my face to convince me to kill anyone at least.)
Also: Why did they have to give up their human names if it didn't matter that they were going to be used as cannon fodder, i.e. to help finish each other off? ""Zombie?"" ""Nugget?"" Really?!
Why would an advanced alien race train children and teenagers into being super soldiers, arm them, teach them how to survive, if it could be so easily discovered the kids were being duped?
Do the aliens like the idea of a challenge if they have to fight the army of minors they created? Come on.
I think this would have worked better as a mini series in which all the different threads and subplots could have been properly introduced, explained over time, and perhaps the romance bit slowly developed. This tidbit in particular felt extremely forced and rushed for the convenience of the target audience, teenage girls.The acting was mixed. Stellar performances by Liev Schreiber, Maria Bello and Chloe Grace Moretz. I had problems with the rest to be honest because I was under the impression that both adult as well as teen/kid actors regretted having to be part of this movie. At least their acting came across so uninspired and bored that this was the first thing to come to mind.So all in all it was enjoyable enough for the action parts, some of the more unique and never before heard ideas, but that wasn't enough to heave this movie over the edge of being considered ""good"" or even good enough for a rewatch unfortunately.
I hope this one might be remade in a few years' time, it certainly did ""Locke & Key"" no harm as Netflix taught us this year."

I have seen far worst post apocalyptic movies that are slow, boring and even dumb. This one is not one of the above. The only thing is that most movies should be 90 minutes maximum. The length is one of the drawbacks of this movie. The good part is Chloe Grace Moretz. At such a young age, this talented girl has delivered an amazing mature performance, which is hardly seen in girls of her age.Spoiler alert: the most frustrating thing till the end you never get to know who are what 'the others'(antagonists) of the movie are. Its a mystery till the end that leaves you frustrated. Apart from this its an OK movie."

This was on Netflix and in my language too so lets go.And well i liked it !! Yes the movie was slow paced at times, yes there is teenage romance cathering more to young girls, but whatever, i could live with it and even get into it (the relationships).My only issue with the movie is that i feel it would had worked way better as a series. Its already been 4 years now and there was no sequels so i doubt one will ever be made, especially considering Chloe probably changed/grown a lot since then, so i kinda feel a bit ""cheated"" by the movie because i really got into it and feel i was left with an unfinish story, without spoilering anything.Yet for a Netflix time killer and especially into our current situation (April 2020, you know...) , this was fun to watch and i don't regret it at all."
" A forgettable Teen Sci-Fi Flick that replaces Story with Flashy Effects
",0.0,-0.5972,2020-03-31 00:00:00,5,"The 5th Wave was an OK movie as apocalyptic sci-fi films go. Unfortunately, despite the flashy effects and cool sequences, it felt rushed and ended too abruptly with no real conclusion to the overall story. Some films that end without conclusions have cliffhangers, but this one just sorta ended with no real pay off. I understand that this is an adaptation to Rick Yancey's books and that in his series the sequel to 5th Wave is Infinite Sea which continues the story of Chloë Grace Moretz' character, ""Cassie Sullivan"" but with the way this film has been panned by critics, the likelihood of a sequel is next to none, leaving this as an unfinished story to stand on it own."
" Picks up at second half
",0.0,0.9828,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"For most of the movie, I thought it was average, nothing special, typical. But then when the twist happened my whole perspective on this movie changed. I really enjoyed this movie. It had an intriguing plot, interesting characters, and a whole lot of action. There's some misdirection in this movie, which keeps the plot exciting, and kept my attention the whole film. Sadly, I don't think this film will do well enough to get a sequel, but even if it doesn't you can still watch it on its own and be satisfied. Some people will not give this film a chance because they think its too much like ""The Hunger Games."" It's completely different. ""Hunger Games"" was not about aliens. Ok, well ""Ender's Game"" was about teenagers fighting aliens. It's nothing like ""Ender's Game"", either. It's completely original. Most of the film did feel kind of ""meh,"" but when the twist came, I forgave that, and was interested to know what would happen next. Considering this movie opened in January which is usually death month for movies that studios think are bad, I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be ""meh"" at best but it was a lot better than I expected. If there's no sequel, I won't care, but if there is, I'll definitely see it.

The actors/actresses Chloe, Alex, Nick, Maika, Ron, and Zackary are the best parts of this movie! Their acting is spot on, fantastic, and really shines! The twist at the end is so shocking you never see it coming until it happens! I have never seen Maika or Alex ever in movies or tv shows but they were both equally talented. Alex Roe as Evan Walker was surprisingly great at being the love interest and the fight scenes. His twist is also so shocking that it leaves you so stunned. Maika is strong as Ringer and makes a good character. But, that's not the only thing that was great, the music is so haunting yet beautiful. You can feel the emotions of what the characters are feeling when the music is on. I did read the book and have to say that they are both very similar. Almost spot on. Watch this movie! It is so enjoyable!"

",0.4939,0.9786,2020-02-08 00:00:00,6,"ATTENTION: Contains a few spoilers from the end of the film. If you haven't seen the film yet, go watch the film first before you read this review.I saw this on Netflix earlier today, and I decided to watch it. Although the movie had only like close to a 6 star rating, it really isn't that bad. Cassie's younger brother, Sam, is taken to an US Army base, while Cassie makes a run in order to save her little brother. She eventually falls in love with Evan Walker, who commits that his family were killed by The Others (the aliens that are attacking Earth). In the end, Cassie saves her little brother and her high school friend Ben Parish as well, while Evan bombs the Army base, in order to kill the US Army leaders, which were actually ""The Others"". Later on, Cassie and Ben develop a plan to save the rest of the kids from who were sent onto the planes.I really like this film. It has a great plot, cute romance, but it should have a sequel. If someone goes and has a plan like this, where the movie obliviously ends with a cliffhanger, then that's where the sequel should start off at. I'm not saying they might do this, or might not, but it would be great for the studio to make more money off of a film that was proven successful during it's box office run, which made about close to 3 times it's budget according to it's page."

It's still good, except one small part has made it bad.That is this movie. Great idea, fairly unique in a world where pretty much everything has been done already... Just slightly... salty in the production. A fair few badly thought out scenes that really throw the whole plot out of the window. I'm no writer but I was thinking hey, if they had just said this instead of that it would have been far more plausible. But it wasn't me making it, so the plausible scenarios are instead played out with silly ideas.Still, if you can shrug off the badly done moments, and don't mind seeing the twist come way before I would imagine they hoped you would.... It's worth a watch. I enjoyed it."

" A Ho Hum Alien Invasion Story For Kids
",0.0,-0.4822,2019-07-10 00:00:00,2,"Chloe Grace Moretz was all right in this. I start by saying that because I desperately want to say something positive. She was all right as Cassie - a high school student who gets caught up in an alien invasion and is separated from her little brother after her parents are killed. If the story had revolved around Cassie and her search for her brother through this threatening environment then the movie might have been passable. Not great, but passable - much like Moretz's performance. Not great, but definitely passable. But, truthfully, the bulk of the movie is just plain silly. It starts by fairly quickly recounting the first three ""waves"" of the alien invasion - aliens knock out all power on earth, then cause natural disasters, then unleash a plague. The fourth wave (to avoid a spoiler I won't describe it) is then unleashed and an army of children gets recruited to defend earth and humanity from the coming fifth wave. That's about it - except for the unnecessary and unconvincing romantic subplot that Cassie gets involved in. That's the story.It's weak in almost every aspect that counts. Let's face it. Alien invasion movies are a dime a dozen. If one is going to go to the effort of making an alien invasion movie then there has to be some hook to catch the viewer with; something to make the movie stand out from the rest of the genre. But Moretz's passable performance aside, nothing and no one else stood out for me. There was precious little action until the last half hour or so and even then the action was unconvincing. Special effects are low quality. There's an attempt at a plot twist but the ""secret"" that gets revealed really didn't cause me any great surprise. Overall I thought the movie had a cartoonish, comic book-type quality to it that made its almost two hour runtime mind-numbing. It seems definitely targetted mostly toward the high school/teenage viewer, and is in fact based on a trilogy of young adult novels - meaning that there actually could be two more movies coming out, although after three years there mercifully doesn't seem to be any move in that direction. My own feeling is that anyone looking for a more sophisticated type of science fiction is likely going to be disappointed in this. (2/10)"

The big ""twist"" of the actual fifth wave was pretty well telegraphed twenty minutes before we saw it and just left me wondering why aliens would go to so much trouble to eradicate a species so stupid as to make this movie in the first place. Kudos to the lead: she apparently did all her own stunts and carried them off nicely, even as she demonstrated an acting range that ran the gamut from A to E, perhaps F. But what was the point of giving the hero this apparently stunning fight sequence if it's shot in almost complete darkness?But so much of the film is WTH? The invaders recruit kids to shoot each other after their parents have been gunned down? They spend weeks turning them into little mini-Rambos for this? Cool uniforms? Special helmets? Was any of that supposed to make sense when all they really needed to do was park the school buses in an aircraft hanger and then blast it to bits? None of it made sense, and I cant believe they actually thought they'd get a marketable franchise out of it.Its sole redeeming feature? The brief scene where the hero is taking a bath in a lake. That was some stunning footage. Pity his acting chops didnt also rise to the occasion."

I could not see a single thing with the fighting with the explosions with the characters talking to each other I might as well have turned off the video and just watch the audio.

-The CGI was on point for a low budget movie. With it being this unknown i expected to see something unrealistic. I didn't.
-The acting was surprisingly on point. Particularly Evan played the role awesomely. Looking really closely one could see him being emotionally troubled but it wasn't too obvious as to detract from the reveal.
-The script was pretty good, and the plot better than that of most YA movies and some A list movies.
-The message was totally on point.
-The camerawork was well done.
-The dramaturgy was absolutely awesome and had me grip the edge of my seat at times.-The only thing that could have been done better is that a major twist was foreshadowed a littlebit too strongly.This is a great movie.

Was determined not to let my apprehension, as to whether 'The 5th Wave' would execute its good concept well (having seen so many potential wastes recently), get the better of me. It is a shame that after genuinely wanting to like it, not with the intention to hate it or want to, that 'The 5th Wave' was yet another potential waste, executing its good idea very ordinarily. Not one of the worst cases but one of the most infuriating ones, not irredeemably awful but the cons outweigh the pros and the cons are hardly big in size. It is not that it didn't try, to me it tried too hard, executing its elements underwhelmingly and they just don't go together.There are a few good things. Chloe Grace Moretz gives it everything, a very committed performance and comes off well compared to everything else. In fact, a good deal of the cast are game.Production design has some atmosphere and while the effects are variable a few are above so-so, credit is due for not overusing and abusing them that it became a CGI-fest. The start does intrigue.Conversely, the camera work and editing were wanting, being far too drab and hasty-looking rather than dynamic. Other effects are artificial-looking. The direction showed someone not at ease with the material and one finding it difficult to control it. While Moretz and the lead cast are game, the children are inept.The dialogue is clunky and excessively cheesy, particularly in the teenage/romantic scenes. It was the story execution that was particularly underwhelming about 'The 5th Wave'. There was not enough at stake for the survival/end-of-the-world element to work, it was too predictable, a lot could be seen from a mile away, and urgency and tension were missing. The alien-invasion parts suffered from a lack of thrills, no suspense and less than menacing villains. The teenage/romantic elements are just awkward and bog the film down, placed inappropriately at times too. On top of neither element being executed well, they don't go well together, coming over as a muddled jumble of tones and cobbled together storytelling, with every recycled, fatigued cliché imaginable with nothing new done with either. The twists were obvious and didn't really feel like twists, the big one not excepted. The characters were generally bland with their development at best sketchy. The ending is sheer nonsense and impossible to take seriously. Also have felt that open-ended ones hinting at a follow-up are rather risky in case that falls through, watching 'The 5th Wave' did nothing to change my mind on this.In conclusion, not awful but there are a lot of issues here. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
" Enjoyable action movie for teens
",0.4404,0.9596,2018-08-27 00:00:00,8,"Just disregard the brutally low reviews of wannabe, frustrated film critics.Overall: I rate this 4 of 5. This film is a post-apocalyptic action movie meant for teens so put yourself in that mindset (a teen) to enjoy this. This film offers decent elements which I have broken down below. If you enjoy watching teens falling in love despite a really big world-altering event is happening in the background (e.g. Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Divergent), then you're going to probably enjoy this film.I have categorized significant noteworthy elements of the film below:Thrill: The protagonist will be running from and fighting off antagonists. The main protagonist (Chloë) is vulnerable and does not magically gain super powers to defeat enemies.Intrigue (plot twist): The major plot twist is nicely done and will makes the movie more interesting.Romance: Decent teen love story will be going on, with a set-up of a love triangle for a possible sequel.Acting: Chloë nails her acting in most scenes. Supporting cast also do good acting, except for the younger kids. Younger kids were seemingly chosen more because they were cute, rather than merit.Plot holes and unrealistic scenes: There are some unrealistic parts (yeah, even if it's sci-fi, it still has to be faithful to reality) like lighting camp fire in a forest filled with antagonists, making love while with an unhealed bullet wound in the inner thigh near genitals (that won't happen IRL), incompetent guards, passionate kissing when everyone should be running, teaching the wrong way of disarming an armed person... stuff like that. Not too major to compromise the film, though."
" The 5th Wave
",0.0,-0.9914,2018-08-17 00:00:00,3,"I saw the trailer for this movie in the cinema, I am a fan of the leading young actress, so that a big draw for me, and it looked like something good, I read later the negative reviews it received, but I was still willing to give it a chance, directed by J Blakeson (The Disappearance of Alice Creed). Basically a city-sized alien spaceship suddenly appeared above Earth, the extra-terrestrials are referred to as ""The Others"", and teenager Cassie Sullivan (Chloë Grace Moretz) recounts the events following the invasion. The alien invaders unleashed made four attacks, referred to as Waves of destruction. In the 1st Wave, an electromagnetic pulse permanently destroyed all electrical power, including transportation and water. In the 2nd Wave, the planet's geology and fault lines were manipulated by the Others, causing earthquakes and mega-tsunamis that destroyed coastal cities and islands. In the 3rd Wave, a strain of avian flu virus was spread, with birds carrying the infection across the planet, one of the casualties was Cassie's mother Lisa (Maggie Siff). Cassie, her father Oliver Sullivan (Office Space's Ron Livingston) and brother Sam (Zackary Arthur) find a refugee camp in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an army unit with working vehicles arrive, Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) claims that the 5th and final Wave is imminent, the Others have begun to use humans as physical hosts, this is the 4th Wave. The children are being taken to safety at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, they say the buses will return to retrieve the adults, Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the army massacring the adults, including her father. Cassie scavenges her way toward the base, but she is shot in the leg by an unseen shooter and passes out. About a week later she wakes up in the farmhouse of Evan Walker (Alex Roe), who saved her, they leave together and head for the base. Cassie is shocked to learn that Evan is an Other, the aliens have invaded Earth years before, he was sent as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw Cassie, he disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave, he warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the Others. At the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that humans outside have been possessed, they provide them with military training, forming them into squads to go on kill missions. Sam is in a squad led by Zombie aka Ben Parish (Nick Robinson), Cassie's former high school crush, along with tough teenage girl Ringer (Maika Monroe), Dumbo (Tony Revolori) and Teacup (Talitha Eliana Bateman). While on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military tracking implant, she is registered as an Other-possessed human on the squad's scopes, the squad realise that the plan is to kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben devises a plan, he has one of his squad shoot him and returns to base, claiming the rest of the squad were killed, then he will try and retrieve Sam, who was left behind. Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik (Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello) during her implant operation. Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam, Evan sets off many bombs and warns them to hurry before the entire facility is destroyed. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military evacuate with the human children by military aircraft, while Ringers helps Cassie, Ben and Sam to escape, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base. Ben's squad is reunited, and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival. Also starring Gabriela Lopez as Lizbeth, Bailey Anne Borders as Julia, Parker Wierling as Jeremy and Nadji Jeter as Poundcake. Moretz is a good choice as the teenager living in the world facing alien invasion, the four attacks of power outage, earthquakes and floods, a bird-flu pandemic and human body snatching set things up reasonably well, but the imminent fifth attack gets clichéd, I sort of went along with it, but not all of the special effects are great, it is muddled, and the ending (that may lead to an unlikely sequel) is silly, it is not boring or terrible, it is just an overly average science-fiction drama. Adequate!"

Usually I check out a movie on IMDB before viewing it. This one I put on without checking it out beforehand. I guessed the scores to well above what has been awarded to it.
As one who is not a fan of SciFi I actually enjoyed the movie.
The acting was very convincing. The storyline kept me involved throughout. Although aimed at a teenage audience our adult daughter informed us she had already seen it as well as reading the book.
There is enough variety to appeal to older audiences and I'd you like kids then you will enjoy the youth.
There is a twist or two along the way and the movie ends on a reasonable note without closing off the story or leaving you up in the air. It makes you think as well. It is not mindless alien rubbish.
Some critics are too harsh and not even able to substantiate giving it shockingly low scores. 
I think seven is a fair score even if you are not a teen!"

This film starts off with the heroine, a teenage girl called Cassie, narrating the story, so it's clearly one of those movies aimed at a younger audience. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact there is a fair amount of horror and violence to be found. The issue of loss and separation of loved ones is dealt with when first Cassie's mother dies from the infection wave. Then her Dad is killed in cold blood, and at the same time she and her younger brother get separated. All quite sad. The military, the ""saviours,"" turn out to be, predictably, ""others"", the name given to the alien invaders, who can adopt human guise. When they massacre all of the adults at a refuge camp that was chillingly real in as far as genocide is sadly one of humanities greatest crimes.
However where it gets silly is having the army (actually ""others"") train kids and turn them into military units in order to be tricked into killing off human survivors! Can't the aliens just do that themselves?
There's a love interest, teen girl meets buff boy, etc, as to be expected.. Acting and effects are all reasonably good. While this film is certainly no SF classic I found it to be reasonably enjoyable hour and a half."

But it just turned out to be a teenage movie with a layer of action and Sci-Fi elements to spice it up.As for the storyline in ""The 5th Wave"", well it was rather mundane and generic, although the twist as to whom The Others were was a nice one, and I had not really foreseen that one.The acting in the movie was adequate, but Chloe Moetz constantly walks around looking like a sullen and semi-depressed girl, so it was hard to take her serious in this movie.The special effects were quite good, as was the CGI. And let's be honest, this is very much a CGI carried movie, because the storyline, plot, characters and acting could only take the movie so far. So, of course, the CGI effects had to lift up the movie.This was hardly an outstanding or particularly memorable movie. And I doubt that I will return to watch this movie a second time."

" HOPE LET'S US SURVIVE
",0.4404,-0.9705,2018-05-13 00:00:00,7,"This is an alien attack film combined with a kids save the world movie. It centers on Cassie and not Katniss (Chloë Grace Moretz) who keeps a journal for first person narration so we can get the heavy meaningful themes, recapped at the end of the feature in case you missed the point. 40 minutes into the film, we cover the first three waves of the attack and Cassie's high school crush. The fourth and fifth wave are a bit ambiguous and seem connected, but ""The 4B Wave"" wouldn't sell.Cassie spends most of the film looking for her brother (Zackary Arthur). If you have seen a film before you quickly realize the twist as we painfully wait an additional 40 minutes for it to manifest itself to the characters. During this time we suffer through long painful dialogue. The ending leads us open for a sequel as this appears to just be a long introduction of characters for a series that could go on ad infinitum. David Vincent knows they're here.The film is designed to appeal to teens and younger. There is no humor in the film as there was in ""Independence Day."" No colorful characters, except for maybe that one girl (Maika Monroe and not a hot Asian chick) and we didn't get enough of her to carry the film. There was nothing wrong with the performance of Chloë Grace Moretz, other than she had dry lines and couldn't do anything with them. They needed to cut 10-20 minutes out of the film.We find out Cassie was poorly named for Cassiopeia the beautiful, vain, and boastful queen. Where is JK Rowling when you need a meaningful name? Ben (Nick Robinson) is another story that would be funny, but they made sure it wasn't.Kids will love this film more than adults. There is minimal swearing, my understanding is they removed a lot from the book in that regard. No sex or nudity. While there is killing, the graphic scenes are more off screen than on. No religious content during the end of the world. More like a PG-11 than 13."

This film is really the first of its kind it includes all types of techniques from the actors and also the fact about camera focuses on the emotions of the characters which emphasizes what the film is about and links in still with the main story line. This movie have a lot of similarities with the film ""Divergent"". Both movies have been based on a society that is divided into different groups. For example, Divergent society was divided in five fractions: Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. On the other hand, ""The 5th Wave"" was divided into two groups: the normal people and people who have diseases. This movie is about four waves deadly attacking Earth, leaving every state and every country ruined. The aliens drain energy and create diseases that effected millions of people and died. The main character in this movie is Cassie. Cassie lost her mother by the disease. The Army came to take the people to the army base and that's how Cassie father died, army people gunned him and others down. The survivors was transferred to the army base on a school bus. When Cassie left the bus to get her brother stuffed animal the bus was driving off, Cassie was running trying to catch up with the bus but she didn't make it. Cassie goes on adventure to look for her little brother named Sam that was left on a bus.

I have seen a few clips from this film on Youtube and thought it might be interesting, so, when I found it in a bargain bin yesterday, going for next to nothing, I paid the paltry few dollars and brought it home.I played it last night and reached the end of the miserable thing wishing that I had left it in the bin and used the paltry few dollars to buy something useful, like liquorice allsorts. You get what you pay for, I guess.Just about every teen flick/post-apocalyptic/alien invasion/wrong-guys-are-the-bad-guys cliché has been recycled in this mind-numbingly vapid waste of 108 minutes of my life. The heroine, Cassie, stumbles from one life-threatening moment to the next and barely gets her hair mussed or face dirty - by halfway through the film I was starting to get sick of close-ups of her perfectly clean, pretty face.I actually started to get twitchy early on in the film, but nearly reached breaking point when the military massacred the adults in the gunfight at the survivours camp and departed, leaving their own dead behind - and their weapons! In light of later revelations, the apparently callous abandonment of their own casualties could be explained, but no military walks off leaving behind weapons than could later be used against them.Expecting a viewer to accept that small children could, in only a few weeks, be turned into combat soldiers, was pushing things a bit far, but it has apparently worked in parts of Africa, so why not the USA too? But then those same children were sent into battle at night, wearing lights on their helmets! Why not just give each a bullhorn so that she/he could stand out in the open and shout at the enemy, ""Here I am! Here I am!""The final nail in the coffin for this awful film was expecting the viewer to believe that one man could carry enough explosives to blow an entire airfield and its buildings into a huge hole in the ground. By then, thank the Lords of Kobol, there were only a few minutes left in this film, so I sweated it out to the end and vowed never to watch it again.I have two teenage granddaughters who like lightweight films, but they wouldn't be able to stomach even this.This film gets two stars from me, and lucky to get even that."

However, for the first couple of 10-15 minutes I was drawn in by the opening narration of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd wave. Then the 4th wave is announced and everything goes down-hill.Not going in to the two largest plot holes I can't help but feel ruined this movie for me. This movie has special effects that looks like they are from 10 years ago, the acting is at the best sub-par and no real tension is built up to make us care for the characters.Now to the plot holes:1. The EMP.
The 1st wave was an EMP, strong enough to wipe out all electricity and render machines useless. This is all fine and when the military shows up everyone is struck by the fact that they have working cars. This is fine, perhaps they are old cars that don't have any electrical parts to speak off (for some far-fetched reason). However, then they end up at the military base where everything is lit up by electricity, and there's not a person that question this! You might say ""Hey, perhaps they had protected wireing, that wasn't hit by the EMP"". To that I say bullshit! Why didn't they military use electrical equipment way earlier during the 1st, 2nd or 3rd wave to greatly help out the population then?3. Child Soldiers
Why would you prefer to send in child soldiers to fight the infections if you have an army? The soldiers should have alot more training, and in any scenario the children should be protected to preserve the species. Yet there's not a soul that questions why children are sent in to fight instead of soldiers? It just oozes of corruption and at the scene where they find out what the neck trackers really do and they say ""they thought they could manipulate us because we're children"", you just wanna go ""Yes!

",0.0,0.9952,2018-02-05 00:00:00,6,"The 5th Wave is a rare of example of a film I enjoyed despite hating the novel it was based on. The book was extremely slow, as it was narrated by the lonely girl the film is focused on. She re-lived her experiences in flashbacks in the book, while the movie is more straightforward, therefore eliminating some of the monotony. Still the film isn't without it's flaws, as it is based on an idea that has been done to death. Aliens have invaded the Earth once again and this time they have done it in four crushing waves. Most of the planet is in ruins, millions are dead, and the few that are left have banded together to try and form some sort of resistance. A 5th wave is coming and the military has surmised that children will be the least affected by it, and have begun rounding them up and training them as soldiers. Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) is one of these children, who is devastated to be separated from her family, but at the same time happy to be fighting along side her life long crush Ben Parish (Nick Robinson). For me, this film was less about the story and more about it's stars. As I said I didn't really care for the story, it's been done, and the whole Hunger Games love angel just seemed to be a lazy rip off. What I did enjoy was seeing two of Hollywood's biggest young stars together in the same film, Chloe Grace Moretz and Nick Robinson. Both of them have been getting bigger and better roles and to finally see them together in a major blockbuster film was a treat. Moretz's character was just another Katniss Everdeen/Tris clone, but she played in well. The true star of the film, was Nick Robinson, the popular kid in High School who transforms into Zombie, the fearless leader of the youthful army. Films like Kings of Summer and Being Charlie saw Robinson take the reigns and make those films his own, and in a way he did the very same thing here. He may not have been THE star, but he certainly was the one to watch, as he was involved in every great scene this movie had to offer. The 5th Wave is a mix of elements and characters simply stolen from other similar stories. The special effects were terrific, the young cast was out of this world, but as a whole, this film wasn't anything special."

" Not a Bad Movie - Interesting and Exciting
",0.5848,0.9185,2017-12-27 00:00:00,9,"Being so-called - just another teen apocalyptic science fiction, it's actually not too terrible. The idea of the movie is pretty interesting, though the plot twist was rather predictable, it was still very fun to watch.
Almost everything in the 5th Wave is expandable and thus a sequel is definitely wanted and possible, as long as it doesn't drift too far from the books - like Allegiant - it'll definitely be big-screen-worthy.
Although I have to admit, the main characters aren't very skilled at acting. Cassie was fine, but Sam - given his age- was terrible at acting, which made the scenes with him rather cringey.
The ending was pretty anti-climatic, but the story itself was so thrilling that if something wrong happens in the end, I would really have a heart attack."
" Enjoyable Film
",0.4404,0.9866,2017-12-24 00:00:00,8,"Good acting, especially from the actress playing Cassie.Always good to see humans fighting back against alien invasions.When Cassie sneaked into the Army base used by the humans possessed by the Others and then did her best to kill the bitch using human kids to kill other humans, I was like Booyah! Kill those muffafukka Aliens!The actress playing Cassie was great, she is a good actress. I also like the plot of alien possessing a human then goes native plot, its been used before and it was done nicely here. Quite sweet and romantic.So I don't get all the negative reviews.This film is not original, but it was fun to watch and the acting was great.In fact, I have done some research and it was based on a series of books which I will buy and read.Anyways nice film, enjoyable to watch, not original but nothing produced in hollywood is any more.Good acting and I felt engaged and I think the actress playing Cassie was very good, she really carried the whole film and did a great job.So I hope whoever made this film will make sequels!"
" Another trite young adult adaptation
",-0.2023,-0.9117,2017-12-20 00:00:00,4,"THE 5TH WAVE is another in an endless wave of young adult novel adaptations based on a futuristic sci-fi premise. It's very much in the line of THE HUNGER GAMES, DIVERGENT, and THE MAZE RUNNER in terms of look and feel, mixing teenage anxiety problems and emotions with a wide-ranging plot. This one's about an alien invasion staged in waves to gradually destroy mankind. The continuously irritating Chloe Grace Moretz plays a kid who joins up with some woodland rebels in order to fight back. Along the way you get Hollywood stars picking up their paycheques (hello, Liev Schrieber and Mario Bello), some absolutely soul-destroying teenage crush romance, some CGI effects, and a trite script. Moretz's look of wide-eyed shock becomes tiresome very quickly and the film's big twists are extremely obvious from the outset. It's another bore, in other words."
" Same As Other YA Novels Turned Movies
",0.0,0.9428,2017-12-16 00:00:00,6,"There was nothing wrong with this movie, but there was also nothing really right. It had potential for a really good story line, however the execution was lacking in character development and there was nothing extraordinary about it to really grasp audiences, there was nothing that made audiences want to invest time and emotion to it. There has been so many YA novels turned movies in the past few years that any new ones need an extra edge to really make it stand out. I would like to see the second book turned into a film to see if they would be able to further develop the characters backstories and expand on the plot, add something a little extra to really draw the attention of the audience because there was nothing truly gripping about this movie. There doesn't seem to be any plans for the sequal but I hope there is a chance for them to continue this project and prove that it was just the first film that flopped."
" Dire nonsense. Avoid at all costs.

It's rare that I write reviews of movies, but this one deserves your careful and thorough rejection. There is no real reason to watch this movie at all, and I am astonished that Liev Schreiber agreed to act in it. It is unmitigated, illogical garbage.The main objection I have to this movie is very simple: If you are a bunch of enormously powerful aliens who have the power to wreak terrible destruction on the earth, why set up an elaborate and quite unnecessary scheme of recruiting and training child soldiers to kill off the last survivors(with all the ghastly patriotic / rebel / freedom fighter nonsense that goes with it) when you have all the technology and tools to do it yourselves? If you shut that thought out of your mind and still choose to watch it, it is still diabolically awful on so many counts, fit only for pre-teens with very low expectations and nothing better to do.I have numerous other objections, but I won't bore you with them.Avoid. You'll thank me for it."
" Good for 11-15 yr kids
",0.4404,0.7389,2017-11-26 00:00:00,8,"I watched this film with my son, who is 11 years old. He thought it was thrilling, and he needed me to sit right by him. For him it was an introduction to Sci-Fi for teens and he absolutely loved it. He felt like this film was made for him, and he is desperate to see the sequel. And no, he wasn't swept of his feet by the leading actress. He just genuinely liked the movie. I would imagine that this film is equally suitable for girls between 11 and 15.Most of the reviews seem to have been written from an adult perspective. I see no reason why an adult would go see this teen movie. Perhaps it was marketed for the wrong audience, but the books on which the script was based are clearly aimed at teens, so for the life of me, I cannot grasp why any adult or late teen would see this movie and then start to criticize it as if it were made for them.So nice intro in Sci-Fi for all kids 11-15 years old."

Heavy cartoonish score, like borrowed from a TV movie smothering whatever is happening on screen. IMDb listed 3 individuals with this screenplay, two with some really impressive films to their credit. Go figure, this sucks. Ditto for direction, seems like they were shooting a spot for Nickelodeon. Can't blame the actors with so little to work with. Ending was left open for a sequel, which based on earnings fortunately seems unlikely. Pass this dog by if at all possible."

Do you see an alien invader...not really. Do you see a space ship? Yes, one and from far away. There is one big name actor and he is on camera for about 18 mins. If you are in high school and like guns, you may like this movie. I watched right to the end, ya no redeeming tricksy ending.

" A good Sci-Fi Adventure
",0.6369,0.9943,2017-08-27 00:00:00,7,"After Earth is being repeatedly attacked by an alien ship, Cassie, an ordinary girl, must travel through hostile lands in order to recover her lost little brother. She'll have to overcome many perils along the way, but a promise is a promise and it must be kept against all odds.It's a movie which bases its story on a devastated Earth after four waves of alien attacks and presents the adventures of a teenage girl who must venture into the unknown in order to be reunited with her brother. While this doesn't sound like much and it actually isn't as imposing as other premises of movies with similar themes, it manages to create a bleak and desolate atmosphere in which the main character can make her desperate attempt. The special effects are seldom and not very well made if you ask me, but they mostly do their job as far as the story is concerned. Nothing groundbreaking in terms of CGI, that's for sure, which is quite a pity. While the characters are decent in complexity, they don't quite manage to be as sympathetic as I hoped, in order to make the viewer feel sorry for their situation, thus creating a dramatic atmosphere. While the plot seems quite generic and linear, it does bring a couple of twists and turns, more or less expected, which actually do a surprisingly good job in lifting up the standard of the movie and thus leaving a good impression in terms of story. Again, nothing wow but good. The finale on the other hand isn't as well made as I hoped, leaving much to be desired, considering the fact that it is very abrupt and leaves much room for a continuation. It's not a bad thing but it seems like they wanted so much to tell the viewer that there will be a next installment that they forgot that they still have to end this one well though, not leaving it sort of hanging. Overall, I found this movie to be between average and good in every aspect. It's a good watch for somebody who enjoys Sci-Fi and a good adventure with a couple of twists, but nothing spectacular as it could have been. I am unable to point out the exact culprit. It's that kind of movie where good enough was used in every corner, thus ending up with a good enough movie which doesn't manage to stand out from a crowd full of similar movies."
" Flawed - but not entirely hopeless - alien invasion story for ""young adults""
",0.5492,0.964,2017-08-24 00:00:00,6,"(Non-young) adults like myself happening to catch British Director J. Blakeson's ""The Fifth Wave"" (as based on the successful book of the same name by American author Rick Yancey) are definitely going to feel like spectres at the feast, as at moments this looks quite like kiddie-fare, even though ""adult"" language is occasionally resorted to, and intimate relations at least hinted at. In particular, the makers have to jump through hoops to try to persuade their audience how it can be that alien invaders need to establish an army of Terran kids to do their dirty work for them.Suspension of disbelief is pushed to its limits in this respect.However, at the level of the execution there is surprisingly little wrong here. Like many ""young adult"" offerings, this one largely ditches sentimentality, has a quite high body-count, and looks realistically tough and uncompromising in most places. The acting from star Chloë Moretz is entirely up to the job, Liev Schreiber does his usual pretty good work, and there is quite a bit of fun (seemingly for both actress and audience) out of Maika Monroe as the very sassy ""Ringer"".Other young people appearing in the film (e.g. top-billed Alex Roe and Nick Robinson) seem a little bit to be going through the motions, though - ironically - several non-key members of the youthful Army squad looked potentially interesting as characters, had they been given a little more to do and say.Although effects are really reduced to a bare minimum here, I differ from many reviewers in finding them adequate, and indeed looked upon the unfolding alien-invasion story as reasonably persuasive and quite well-told. Later on, things got relatively predictable (indeed even the plot twists seemed so), but all in all, this is NOT a disaster, and does have at least a few interesting ideas.Needless to say, the piece ends with the ""promise"" of a sequel, given that rather little has been resolved. And, as ever, that kind of thing will prove an annoyance to some.Above all, it remains a little hard to see which target audience will really get most out of this film. How old or young exactly do you have to be? For me the jury is out on that one."

" One of the worst book films ever.

Through this movie you put the beautiful book of Yancey Rock into a bad daylight. This movie is a chaotic sequence of small details that did not capture any important lines from the book. But the movie gives you a wrong picture of the story line. Many details did not match the movie. It was a big loss of time by looking at this movie. Use your time to read the books.

I really expected to see aliens not a bunch of humans who are kinda possessed with aliens.And why is it so wacky? Why do aliens need humans to fight for them if they are so high-tech and can disable every single human tech? Don't they have their own army?why do they use human facilities like planes when they have better things? where are authorities? where are other countries they considered America the only place on the planet? Even having 3 writers didn't help to make a good ending the end is open and unfinished? What happened to that alien commander? He just left earth peacefully? What happened to those children they took? The screenplay was so unprofessional. I couldn't see any sorrow or pain in peoples eyes. Come on they have lost their beloved ones why do they act relax? And about that Evan he just appeared from nowhere and fell in love with just a glance? It's not a romance or love story.How did Evan actually become a half-breed? Why couldn't they force him or program him to obey orders? There is no introduction to him. You should have put More time and attention on the screenplay. Or maybe you wanted to lower The budget needed as much as possible so you started to destroy the Scenario.

Most have featured special effects, nudity, and profanity because they believe that the public is stupid.They're certainly not ready for this movie because you must pay attention to catch the subtleties (no, I didn't misspell subtitles). The target audience probably won't get the movie, which sort of explains the low ratings.Of course, if you can follow a story and you're not expecting nudity (washing in the creek scene only), profanity, or sex, this movie offers a good story.Strangely, along with Super 8, it is located around U.S. 35 in western Ohio.It's all about the indoctrination of the planet's youth.

And a month after watching it, i can say, in my opinion this isn't a good movie, but far away from being a bad one. The first 3 minutes are super intense and incredible well made. In 3 minutes you got an idea of the atmosphere, the situation the main character is in and what's going on on earth, without a word of exposition, awesome. The following 50 minutes are not as great as the opening, but still well made. Not great, but good actors, good introduction (even if it is not that spectacular), and a nice idea in general. The last 40 minutes or so, are what makes the movie a 3/5. It felt fast, unexpected (in a negative way, like Evan shows up at the military base like: ""Here I am just to make the Plot working!"") but also expected (in negative way as well, like you still kind of know that Evan is going to show up at the military base). And the camera work sometimes felt random (weird slow motion). And the ending was weird, but I think it was cool. The message is that you should always keep hoping, and with the open end, they challenge you to hope. In conclusion, I just want to share my opinion. I think it was better than everyone is saying. Great first 3 minutes, great message, great ending, good following 50 minutes, good acting, good atmosphere. OK in the middle. Weird clichés (Evan in the lake), sometimes weird camera, weird love triangle. But nothing terrible. If i could, I would rate it 6,9/10"

Well luckily for you you don't have to choose one in this film because you get all 4 elements in one film. The screen writing was done in a way that makes you believe that ""1000 monkeys typewriter"" thing is true. I can't explain why but it's terrible. If you see it you'll understand. I've liked Chloe grace moretz since 500 days of summer came out and watched her films ever since and I can honestly say this is by far the film where she was forced to give her worst performance to date. The cast for this film look quite promising but it seems that even Liev Schreiber is just taking on roles to get his IMDb list longer or his pockets fuller or perhaps he got fooled into this one by not being given a script beforehand to see what a horrible role he would receive. I don't know how these people got convinced, maybe they were brainwashed (pun intended) but if you want to remain fans, stick to their better films and avoid this one. The CGI is almost on par with the PS2 games' graphics I used to play as a kid. The water (which I know takes a lot of rendering when made with CGI) looked like some sort of blue or grey gooey stuff rushing in at almost 37 frames per second while Chloe runs away at 24 frames per second. Now call me a purist if you want, but these things matter when trying to create a realistic looking flood. And believe it or not but things actually get worse as the ""bad guys"" are distinct from humans when you put glasses on that make them look like a 1980's arcade game version of the mask by Jim Carrey. This was perhaps the worst feature of the film, that they used arcader graphics for a futuristic tech device. Then finally we reach the camera work... Besides the only scene with action in the entire film being to dark to see anything and forcing you to rely on your own imagination formed by the sounds they play you, the camera-work was probably done by some kids who constantly tried to blow into the camera lens-arm to get the sound out of whatever trumpet thing they thought it was.. This would explain the inconsistent head shots, unnatural movements and bad angles being used. To be fair to all the departments I've just criticized in this review, they did the best they could with one of the worst written scripts from the 21st century. Get a girl as protagonist and the rest of the film is predictable enough to basically be any film you've ever seen before. So here is how I will reward the score. Writing 1/10 Acting 3/10 CGI 2/10 Camera work 3/10 Music score 4/10 TOTAL 13/50 rounded to 3/10"

" Confusing, boring and without any sense
",-0.4939,0.4884,2017-02-17 00:00:00,2,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie after watching trailers. It turned out to be cheap-looking, confusing and boring with teenage cast and a couple of well-known good actors (Ron Livingston and Liev Schreiber) that didn't save it from the bad story and script. The dialogues sound terrible and most are completely not believable. It's a good example of a bad film that is bad starting with the story.The main idea of a school girl saving the world from aliens, after she grabs a rifle and all of a sudden becomes a worrier without anything given how she becomes one, is beyond anything sensible. There are lots of confusing and illogical goings-on in the story. When the fifth wave comes (the alien takeover), they take full control of the territory and are now hunting the last remaining humans one by one with alien craft hovering in the air. And yet, the aliens occupy a huge military base full of helicopters and land vehicles they use disguising themselves as human soldiers. Whatever for?! People that are hiding in the woods believe these aliens are human soldiers when they come, and that's in a situation when every single human being out in the open is in danger. How can a whole military base full of human soldiers exist and these poor people not even suspecting anything? What's more is these aliens-disguised-as-soldiers take little kids to the base and train them to become soldiers to kill humans, making the kids think humans are aliens. Kids?! They must be kidding. There is also a dull love story they threw in of this hero girl and some guy living in the woods who saves her from the aliens and then turns out to be an alien himself, but so sympathetic to humans that he decides to help her in her fight against the aliens. These things are just illogical and confusing.Don't expect to see anything that looks like an alien or great special effects or anything spectacular - the only CGI you will see in this movie is of an alien ship hanging in the air. All in all, it's probably the worst alien invasion movie I've seen since some cheap and silly 50s and 60s stuff. I could hardly wait for it to end. Not recommended."

I find the 4th and 5th wave are totally not needed at all and stupid. Its not logical. If you are the aliens, all you need are just to keep the 1st 2nd and 3rd waves coming. And its the end. I don't even want to touch on the romance. Its just plain cheesy for kids. So when we see the alien spacecraft hovering i can't believe the US government got their power back and did not try fire missiles at it or try to shoot it down? They just leave that alien spacecraft hovering till the end, i did not even see anyone try to shoot at it. Just blindly ground battle killing each other and let the main source of this problem floating. So we humans are just going to sit there and wait for the aliens to keep on sending waves after waves and we are going to keep our HOPE going and kill each other over and over again? I'm really amaze that someone would think of something like the 5th wave are the aliens using a bunch of teens and kids train to exterminate the adult survivors. I had a good laugh on that. LoL.. Ohhh i'm so afraid and peeing my pants now. Please.. I can easily knock out 5 of those 10 year old kids out cold with or without weapons. I bet most adults can overpower kids easily too OK. Seriously an army of brainwashed kids and teens are going to exterminate everyone age above thirties suspected to be aliens?? That is the most childish and stupid invasion plot ever.. If i'm those aliens i would rather brainwash the adults and exterminate kids.. Isn't that more efficient? Those who thought of this movie plot, please use your brains to think of plot with some sense in future. Start really well but ends extremely bad and lame.

If the movie itself was anything like that first scene it would be fantastic. It isn't.First the positive. Outside of Maria Bello hamming it up, the acting isn't that bad. And that is about it for the positives. The special effects and setting make this seem more like a made for TV or perhaps a headlining SyFy movie rather than a Triple-A theater release. The story telegraphs twists that Ray Charles would find hard to miss. The turncoat good guys practically twist their invisible mustaches. The good guy child soldiers are dressed in black ninja cameo and yet all wear giant led flashlights on their head. I am no military expert but that seems like a no-no. The invading Aliens plan makes zero sense and each twist brings the film closer into The Happening territory.As someone who can watch the similar themed Red Dawn and leave logic comfortably outside the room, all this doesn't kill it for me. Then the movie goes full Twilight. You never go full Twilight. They were going for Buffy and Angel and ended up with Xander and a Praying Mantis. The romance seems like that between an injured kidnap victim and the creepy guy at the gas station who still goes to high school parties.Poor Chloë Grace Moretz just wants her own YA series to complement her own serious films like Jennifer Lawrence got with The Hunger Games. Instead, she got a ripoff like Shailene Woodley got with Divergent. To make matters worse unlike Divergent this Turkey is unlikely to get the two sequels no one is asking for."
