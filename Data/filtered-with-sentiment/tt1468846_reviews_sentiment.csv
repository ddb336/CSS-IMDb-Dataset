" One has to work to make a movie this bad
",-0.628,0.4926,2021-02-16 00:00:00,1,"I love Anna Kendrick and I hate rate a movie with her in it this poorly, but good heavens that was just a bad movie!"
" Get a Job Is Good
",0.4404,0.8516,2021-02-15 00:00:00,5,"I don't need a job, I have a brand. * The iStalkyou app is genius. * Look, it's the dude from Tropic Thunder * And the dude from Harold & Kumar. * I love Halo. * Miles Teller is cool and Bryan Cranston is funny. * Cameron Richardson from Rise gets naked asffffff! * I love Get a Job.(I'd go on but it gets pretty crazy from here, plus I do have a life)"
" Mediocre
",0.0,0.9763,2021-02-07 00:00:00,5,"I'm going to be completely honest, I really enjoy this movie. It's by no means great, but with a sense of humor that I thought worked and the fun charm of Teller, Kendrick, Cranston, Brie, and everyone else here, the film wasn't a complete mess. It could've been a much better movie, but at the end of the day it's a dumb, fun mess that I could watch a couple more times."
" Good actors bad script
",-0.1531,-0.9046,2021-02-05 00:00:00,3,"I would give this movie a 1 if it weren't for Anna Kendrick and Bryan Cranston, who made the best with what they were given. The movie follows Will, his girlfriend (Anna Kendrick), his dad (Bryan Cranston), and his roommates. The film is supposed to be a comedy about life in the real world after college. But it is not funny at all. I do think I laughed even once. A lot of the jokes are very cringe-worthy, and I didn't like any of the characters. You know it's probably bad when they shoot it in 2012 and then don't release it for 4 years. The exception to all this was Anna Kendrick's and Bryan Cranston's characters, who were way underused. However, these characters are given a couple of serious scenes, which made me glad I watched it. But there are a lot of good actors in this movie, such Brandon T. Jackson and Alison Brie, who are completely wasted in the film. It's sad because this film had a lot of potentials. But since it was just shot before Anna Kendrick's and Bryan Cranston's careers really blew up, I can't help feeling like they were just trying to cash in on theirs' fame. This film had a lot of potential, but it sadly didn't live up to it."
" Disjointed unfunny mess of a comedy
",-0.3182,0.3322,2020-12-18 00:00:00,1,"There's a reason as to why this film was released years after its filming date and went straight to video. It's quite a mess of a comedy. Featuring a little too many characters (most of which we don't care about) trying to get jobs just isn't entertaining. The comedy is just forced, is either gross out and silly and in no way clever- very standard and a little too ""try-hard"" for its R rating.The film has the feel of a sitcom comedy (perhaps there is/has been a sitcom with this exact same type of plot/story). Thankfully the film isn't long as it's less than 1 hour 20 minutes (excluding end credits). Certainly just a one time watch."
" Pretty enjoyable
",0.7269,0.9619,2020-12-18 00:00:00,8,"Great concept with the right cast, solid acting and sloppy story that I don't mind. Unfortunate this got hate it's much better than perceives to be! Maybe you could say it Get a job could be better but I appreciate the final product, it has some funny moments and relatable characters that I would definitely hangout with! Another cool thing about this is I watched Cooties with Jorge Garcia in it too right before this."
" Zzzzzzzzz
",0.0,0.875,2020-09-13 00:00:00,2,"Sooooo boring!!!!!! Don't waste your time, stare at the ceiling fan better. A ceiling fan actually serves a purpose, this ""movie"" doesn't."
" Wow....
",0.0,-0.7184,2020-08-18 00:00:00,1,"In my opinion, everyone involved from the conception to the excecution of this film, should never be allowed to partace in the film industry. I stoped after about 15 minutes... I wrote this to warn other viewers to rather go for a root canal in hell than to watch this film as it would be less painfull."
" So boring
",-0.3804,-0.8684,2020-06-16 00:00:00,4,"I normally quite like this kind of light comedy but this was so boring. Not only that but how unrealistic can it be. The way they find jobs as if they grew on trees although they have no experience and clearly present and smell badly. Even the dad still gets the job he wants by stalking the guy. As if the position wouldn't have been filled by then and as if there aren't hundreds of younger as qualified people applying who didn't act like a crazy person.
I don't know maybe in the US this is actually more normal but in Europe there is no way. I just found this whole film stupid. Even Anna's presence in it didn't help."
" A reasonably good idea, executed extremely poorly.
",0.4404,0.7328,2020-04-27 00:00:00,3,"The idea of a film about how hard it is to get a good job, regardless of your age, is a good idea. However, this film is not good. It is written poorly, by someone who appears to have almost no real world experience of talking to another person. There's very little character development, and nothing that they do makes any sense. Urgh, I never want to see this movie again."
" Truly terrible
",-0.0516,-0.5838,2020-01-20 00:00:00,1,I couldn't even finish watching it! So disappointing.
" Sunday Afternoon Movie
",0.0,0.0508,2020-01-04 00:00:00,4,Not all that good but possible worth a watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon.
" Worst movie of all time
",-0.6249,0.0,2019-12-07 00:00:00,1,"There are so many disconnects in the movie, nothing about it makes sense"
" POORLY EXECUTED PLOT
",0.0,0.2004,2019-12-05 00:00:00,2,"This movie was so bad I cringed throughout it. I didn't even laugh one time and usually I'm a lover of cheesy dumb comedy. With all the great actors in this movie, I expected more. The plot of the movie could've been good, but it was poorly executed."
" Subversive and Ironic... Or just not very good?
",-0.5458,0.7336,2019-11-26 00:00:00,6,"This is a mediocre comedy with a ridiculously stacked cast. Not since Movie 43 have there been so many great actors in a comedy that is just plain not funny. Although in this case it is not because the film is outlandish and crude, it is just kind of dull. The stellar actors in this movie get nothing to do for the most part and it reads more like a paint-by-numbers early 2000s comedy where it seems to be giving out scudo-philosophies on life, while mostly getting things wrong and not really saying much of anything of actual note.Here is the thing though, it's a film about the compromises that promising people make for money and what is expected of them and when you look at the cast and the quality of the film you realise that it is a perfect metaphor for the themes of the movie. Did the filmmaker intend to send a message about the compromise of growing up and working with the movie itself?! If so then it is a subversive masterpiece that they slipped by studios to become a real life example of the modern day problems it is supposed to highlight.Overall I don't think this is actually the case, you can still take it as an example of how great actors get roped into doing a bland script through promise of money and meaning, but apart from that it is only one to watch for the cast, just don't expect to laugh or really feel much of anything by the end. Solid 'Eh'."
" The cast were well selected
",0.2732,0.953,2019-10-19 00:00:00,9,"The cast were great. I like that the actors managed to reincarnate in their roles. There was a slight subtle humor that was nothing special. I expected more. Perhaps they should have focused more on the humor in the movie and would have appreciated more. The finale was the best of the whole movie, but it was too short. The whole movie is designed almost well, and it is only because of the great performance of the cast that this movie will be rated a little higher, but nothing more."
" Ms Kendrick should get a job (No spoilers)
",0.0,-0.3089,2019-04-08 00:00:00,2,"I really believe that if a film is going to be simply average it shouldn't be produced. That ship has sailed with this production. A below average performance by a tenuously average cast.More specifically, there's no reason to pay money to see Anna Kendrick's pinched little face and listen to her millennial psychobabble when we see and hear that all around us on a daily basis. Perhaps it's meant to be some sort of parody? John Hughes 2.0 since Miles Teller bears a mild resemblance to John Kusak in terms of his look and style? Who can say. I don't think that even the producers know the intended vibe. The directors certainly don't.I have to say that after seeing this and the smattering of Anna Kendrick's work I'm really just not impressed with her as an actor. Whatever character she's given she presents the same flat performance with the pinched face. Perhaps they should have made this one into a quasi musical too? Hmm. No, I don't think that would have saved it. Perhaps a cartoon. She's better with voiceovers.If you haven't seen the film, no need to. Just go to the nearest hipster dive cafe and you'll see little Kendrick lookalikes everywhere. Watch your step or you'll land on a hipster."
" a comedy about the pitfalls of working
",0.3612,0.9114,2018-11-18 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it is a humorous take on life after graduating. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Very misogynist
",0.0,-0.8624,2018-10-04 00:00:00,1,"It's horrible. Specially the kind of ""revenge"" at the end. Absolutely criminal and misogynist action. Can't believe how a good cast is this movie."
" Decent
",0.0,0.8952,2018-09-17 00:00:00,6,"Well, it's not super, super funny, but at least it's enjoyable. The jokes made are not that bad, but there was room for improvement. I expected to get a lot of laughter and my desires were not satisfied. I guess we can just throw it into the commercial series section and just forget about it."

" so many good actors
",0.4902,0.8794,2017-12-31 00:00:00,4,"Will Davis (Miles Teller) and Jillian Stewart (Anna Kendrick) are a recent graduate couple with jobs lined up. It's an overconfident generation where every little accomplishment is greeted with rewards. Will's first paying job at LA Weekly is greeted with downsizing. He and his roommates are weed-smoking video-gamers. Luke (Brandon T. Jackson) starts at a trading firm. Ethan (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has a questionable internet idea. Charlie (Nicholas Braun) is a teacher. Will gets a motel night manager job and quickly gets fired. His dad (Bryan Cranston) also gets downsized and faces the new landscape. Tanya Sellers (Alison Brie) is an inappropriate manager and Katherine Dunn (Marcia Gay Harden) is the strict VP.There are so many good young actors and skilled veterans in the cast. None of the characters are worth rooting for. There are too many of them and with too many stories. There are lots of attempts at humor but few actual laughs. It has to be the fault of the writers and director. Even the basic premise of a generation of underachievers being rewarded is questionable. Neither Will nor Jillian is presented as slackers. Ethan is delusional and only Charlie truly fits the premise. In fact, Charlie brings the premise to its conclusion. This is so scattered that nothing sticks. If these actors weren't so good, this would really suck."
" Milennials Pre-Employment
",0.0,-0.3107,2017-09-18 00:00:00,5,"So what happens after you've gotten your degree, don't have a job and don't want to move back home? That's the plot of this film. A group of graduates without jobs move in a frat type house and seek meaningful employment.Will Davis (Miles Teller), his father, Roger Davis (Bryan Cranston) and his girlfriend Jullian Stewart (Anna Kendrick) find ""you can't always get want you want..but ya just might find whatcha need..""This is a a film you will want to watch before your unemployment runs out. It'll make you think ""okay, it's not that bad."""
" Work to rule
",0.0,-0.9623,2017-03-17 00:00:00,4,Get a Job is a so-so movie that was shot in 2012 but only released in 2016 when most of its cast became famous in the interim period.It is mainly about college graduates entering the uncertain world of work and how they deal with it. Which is mainly not well which leads to money issues and confidence problems.Will Davis (Miles Teller) thinks he has a job lined up after working as a summer intern only to discover that the firm had downsized and he needs to find another job quickly. His room mates are struggling with their jobs as well. His father (Bryan Cranston) and his girlfriend (Anna Kendrick) both lose their jobs soon after.The youngsters are hard working slackers and it is the employers that are actually presented as vile but the film is not really that funny.
" Eh
",0.0,0.936,2017-02-26 00:00:00,4,"You would think this movie was a early comedy in all these actors careers. Nope, caught me by surprise when I saw 2016. Miles Teller, Anna Kendrick and Brian Cranston come on now you know this was just a paycheck for them. Straight up paint by numbers story. I gave it a 4 because there were some funny moments in it and Allison Brie is hilarious as the HR we would all love to have."
" Just...Embarrassing
",0.0,0.6887,2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"I really cannot express how disappointing it is to have a film with such talented young actors and have it squandered on this piece of film-garbage. There is a whole slew of supporting cast that deserve so much better than to appear in such an uninspired sequence of events. Every character is a stereotypical punch-line waiting to happen. Even an appearance from the legendary John C. Mcginley's Dr. Cox Whistle is not enough to save this plodding, depressing mess.Seeing Walter White out of work is about as thrilling as remembering that he used to be Malcolm in the Middle's dad.I do, however, want to commend the filmmakers for attempting (admittedly with poor results) to address the frustration and actual difficulties faced by today's generation, and realise that it isn't all about being spoiled... Until that Hollywood ending shows us it is just that."
