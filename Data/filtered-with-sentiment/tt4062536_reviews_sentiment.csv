" Unique tempo
",0.0,0.4879,2021-03-26 00:00:00,8,"I almost lost my interest at first half but surprisingly towards the end, it shines a lot with own tempo.This is the movie that exploded in the end similar as Whiplash but in its own tempo."
" Super Impressive
",0.802,0.9732,2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Really impressed with this one. Finally, a film with a great premise that executes it excellently.
A really tense atmosphere through kept me glued to the screen; the pacing was excellent, and never felt like it dragged on. Acting was spot on, gore effects were great and believable, and the ending was solid.
An excellent little 90-minuter, definitely give it a watch if you have a spare hour and a half!"
" Dull
",-0.4019,-0.8748,2021-02-18 00:00:00,1,"Lots and lots of nonsense dialogue interspersed with brief, blurred and unlit violent scenes.
It's a very poor effort."
" Worst movie ever

" Gritty, Edge of Your Seat Thriller
",0.1027,-0.975,2021-02-02 00:00:00,8,"""Green Room"" (2015) is a tense, violent, escape thriller. It's about a struggling punk rock band who book an appearance at a secluded road house. Things get ugly when one of the visiting band members accidentally stumbles upon a murder, causing the group to remain trapped by the skinheads who manage the venue. Patrick Stewart appears as the depraved owner determined to wipe out all evidence. Anton Yelton, in one of his final performances, is one of the band members. The abysmal setting of the road house makes the desperation of the band members seem all too real as they encounter this group of dangerous humans and their vicious dogs. You will be on the edge of your seat wondering who will survive. The ending is satisfying."
" What a gig!
",0.0,0.9354,2021-01-22 00:00:00,7,This movie is like a Jack in the Box...it has a slow wind up and them BOOM!Its a really effective style giving us time to get to know the key characters before all hell breaks. This means as movie-goers we care about what happens to the characters making for a much better movie.Patrick Stewart is beyond good in this movie.Excellent :)
" Extremely uncomfortable
",-0.4391,-0.6163,2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Green Room is not, by any means or stretch of the imagination, a FUN movie. It's very uncomfortable, grimy, violent, and unsettling. It's really hard to like."
" Go in with NO expectation
",-0.4466,-0.039,2021-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I knew nothing going into this movie other than that it was an A24 film so I knew it was going to most likley be off the beaten path. If you can go into this without a preconception, the fun is definitely there. More than once I was caught off guard or on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to happen next. Does the dialog always hit the mark? No, but that's okay the unique suspense and gore makes up for it in one way or another."
" Patrick Stewart gives a terrifying performance
",-0.5719,-0.8884,2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Patrick Stewart's villain is absolutely bone-chilling. A stellar performance from the entire cast. This movie is shocking and not for the weak stomached, however it drives home the horrifying nature of neo-nazism in the United States today. I was left ruminating on the events of Green Room throughout the days following my viewing. The film becomes more horrifying the more you ponder its characters * do not watch if you are sensitive to emotional disturbance *"
" I look forward to seeing more of the director's work.
",0.0,0.6949,2021-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Tight, competent and well constructed with one or two innovative moments to surprise veteran horror aficionados. I particularly liked the bullet countdown towards the end and simple though it was, never seen it before and most effective. I don't feel that I became as involved as I might have and this was probably down to the number of people involved , the speed with which everything happened and a level of confusion as to what the real big picture was. It is not essential to know everything and sometimes that element of disorientation from not knowing can be helpful, but I did feel a bit lost early on when maybe I should have been getting more involved. All performed well with Patrick Stewart adding gravitas and I look forward to seeing more of the director's work."
" Dark and intense executed well
",0.34,0.9654,2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,"I think that this movie experience is a great one for casual viewing, especially if you like dark movies. I think the set and cinematography of this movie are really well done and I think the plot is unique for what it is. Although the characters may not be super memorable, I give this movie a lot of credit and I think the acting is fairly underrated. A24 movies seem to almost always really impress me and this definitely does.Patrick Stewart kills his role of main villain, he is always calm and calculating. I also was amused that he kept a British accent while playing a neo nazi. There's plenty to like about this movie and I think that it could be a cult classic. This is also Anton Yelchin's best performance so there is that."
" Must watch
",0.0,0.9099,2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"Great character work, has you rooting for the band the entire movie. And a great ending. Wouldn't necessarily call this a horror film, more like Thriller action drama. Would Definitely recommend"

" One hell of a heart pounding ride!
",-0.7088,0.9631,2020-11-08 00:00:00,7,What a great indie movie. The talent and passion on offer from both the film maker and the cast is amazing! The film is all kinds of dark and disturbing but it is so well executed that you cannot look away. There are some beats here and there which felt a touch obvious but they were so easily forgiven due to the film being so well made. If you want terror and anxiety then this is definitely your flavour!
" what was supposed to be the takeaway here?
",0.0,0.9587,2020-11-08 00:00:00,4,"I've seen a number of positive reviews for this film over the years, but I never got around to watching it until tonight, wanting to something off of my eternal film backlog.Cinematically the movie looks great and the setup is good, and there are excellent performances here, but very early on the whole plot kind of goes out the window. Predictably, almost everybody dies, and the people who do survive do so bc the bad guys permitted them an illogical opportunity to do so. I'm left here on a saturday evening wanting 90 minutes or so of my life back. If there's any redeeming quality, it's that I had a chance to see Anton Yelchin in another acting role...someone gone way too early. Rip."
" Utter sh**e
",0.0,-0.7603,2020-10-31 00:00:00,2,"Great premise ruined by bad setup, acting and a very slow plot. Gore for the sake of it like any bad B movie. Can't believe Patrick Stewart would sink so low!"

The movie fits the standards of modern day horror movies. It is very strong on violence, gore, and terror. Overall a good movie. Probably would not watch again but good."
" A Suspenseful Thrill Ride!
",0.4199,-0.8056,2020-09-20 00:00:00,7,"Green Room is written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier (Soul-nay), it stars Patrick Stewart and the late Anton Yelchin, among others. The film follows a punk band, playing an out-of-town show in a neo-nazi bar, but after witnessing a murder backstage they become trapped in the green room and are forced to fight for their lives.Originally premiering at festivals in 2015, Green Room didn't get a mainstream release until early 2016, and boy what a gem this film is. I went in with moderate expectations after hearing fairly positive things about the movie, but nothing could've prepared me for exactly how suspenseful this movie was. Green Room, doesn't take any time kicking off its story; after a brief introduction, once the band arrives at their gig, the pressure begins mounting as you get the feeling that you would when you're in a place you don't belong, which left me waiting for something to go awry. That is a common theme throughout this movie, I was constantly expecting something to go wrong, but just as I thought the film would reach a breaking point, there was a brief moment of relaxation only for that to be cut short by something truly shocking. These sort of unprecedented story moments, is due in large part to Saulnier's writing, as he consistently toys with audience expectations; downplaying certain story beats only for it to blowup a minute later. I was constantly left stumped, not knowing where the story was going to go, and how the characters would escape the situation (if they even would at all). This sort of unpredictable storytelling, carried over until the third act, but I'll touch on that in a bit.Another aspect as to what makes this film so shocking, is how authentic it feels. Although not always grounded in reality, the events that took place could be plausible knowing the fucked up world we live in, and the gruesome violence had weight and felt real. The performances is also what makes this film work, as it could've easily unfolded into some b-movie horror that's unintentionally funny, however the actors and actresses play their roles well. My only gripe comes from the dialogue, as I felt some of it seemed pretty stilted and could've used some reworks, but it doesn't break the movie. Though there isn't a ton of time spent developing the band, you get the feeling that the characters are close and share some semblance of a bond, which makes the events of the film that much more impactful. Anton Yelchin is particularly good in his role as Pat, there is a specific scene about forty minutes in where you feel the weight of something his character goes through. The main draw for this film was Patrick Stewart, and he was good but nothing outstanding. He felt menacing in a couple scenes, but overall it didn't feel like he had much to do, but the scenes he was in, it was the good acting you'd to expect from an actor of his caliber.As I mentioned earlier I found the third act to be the weakest part of the film, that is due in part to the finale feeling a bit anti-climatic. I wasn't expecting anything crazy, but I didn't feel the tension I expected to, that may be because of how suspenseful the movie already was so I was sort of fried by the time I got to the final few minutes. It didn't deteriorate too much from the overall experience, it just felt like the movie lost a bit of its edge by the time it's not stuck in one location. There are also some aspects to the finale, some people might find goofy, which I won't spoil, but it mostly worked for me, even if I felt like it deviated from what it was going for in the first half.In general Green Room is a splendid surprise, and clocking in at just over ninety minutes, the film moves briskly, never giving the audience time to relax and think of what just transpired. I highly recommend this film, but only if you can handle suspense and ultra-realistic violence, as I can see this film being triggering for some people. I don't know how often I'll revisit the film, but for now I can't get it out of my head, and for the reason I'm giving Green Room a 7.5/10."
" Green Room
",0.0,0.5106,2020-09-17 00:00:00,9,"A gloriously violent survival horror with an intense and spellbinding colour palette, thanks to Saulnier and A24 we get to see Patrick Stewart in a psychopathically brilliant new light."
" Brutal and so good
",-0.228,0.1779,2020-09-17 00:00:00,8,"This movie is broooooootal! And sooo good. My mom picked this out for our movie night -- and because she claims our Oregon relatives are in this movie. Which, is not a compliment. But the performances, tension, harsh plot turns all make this a very compelling watch. Thanks mom."
" Am I missing something?
",-0.296,-0.6993,2020-09-16 00:00:00,5,"Meh. After hearing the hype about Green Room for a few years, I finally got around to watching it today. I was very underwhelmed. I kept reading comments along the lines of ""don't spoil anything for yourself"" and ""go in totally blind"", but I don't understand what they meant? The plot went exactly where I thought it would. I thought there'd be some crazy twist or unexpected plot element, but nope. I was honestly kind of bored by the end of it. Not terrible, just nothing particularly memorable either. 5/10"
" Short intense thriller
",0.1779,-0.9217,2020-09-06 00:00:00,7,"This review contains spoilers.Green Room is a thriller about a band that is trapped by a dangerous gang. The movie follows the band from when they are performing at the bar to their capture and subsequent escape attempts. The movie has brutal spurts of gore as the band is forced to defend themselves.Green Room is a brutal movie with lots of gore. The movie is a low budget flick set in the same location for much of the movie as the band try to stay one step ahead of their captors. This is perhaps the movie's strength, the location becomes a characters as the death count rises and the characters explore more of the bar. The gore in this movie can border on excessive. Characters are hacked to death by the brutal gang, but even this is to show how crazy the antagonists are.Patrick Stewart plays the leader of the gang as he tries to corner the band. He does a good job portraying his character as he embarks on progressively violent tactics to kill the band members. Patrick Stewart is the surprise of the series and makes for an interesting antagonist to see.The story in this movie is difficult to follow. The movie likes to present a character switching sides as a twist but it is not good to make only one quip and the rest of the characters simply accept it. The main character played by Anton Yeltsin is great as he portrays the desperate struggle his band undergoes.Green Room is recommended. The movie is a tight and intense thriller.Grade: B"
" Could have been good, but it felt a bit lazy, to me at least.
",-0.3182,-0.8526,2020-08-27 00:00:00,4,"Duct tape really is a wonderful thing, in all situations, something I can attest to, in addition to certain unfortunate characters in this movie - wound management for the most part.It did hit a raw nerve or two, here and there. The gore is occasionally good, sparing, making it somewhat more jarring to start with, however wasn't as affective as the movie rolled on, perhaps on account of doing some of the ickier bits early on.I like that Patrick Stewart is playing a very different character, but he's still quite softly spoken, making it hard not to allow nicer characters he's been bleed into this one a little.Anyway, limited rhyme or reason behind the vast majority it, just THESE people, THIS questionable situation, a few grim things, muted somewhat by characters I wasn't really invested in.Having praised duct tape earlier on, it unfortunately couldn't quite hold this movie together."
" Not Bad!!
",0.5321,0.1192,2020-08-23 00:00:00,6,I won't tell that this is a best movie nor worst. It is OK type. There will not any romances or revenge or puzzle solving. It is surviving movie of 5 people who witnessed a crime and some skinhead trying to kill them.

" Raw but lacking
",0.0,0.4385,2020-08-10 00:00:00,6,"The storyline was 5/10 at best, but the scenes of raw amateur violence were great. You really seemed to experience the in-the-moment points of action during which a horrible yet necessary act must be taken.

" This movie was disappointing in so many ways...
",-0.4939,0.2108,2020-07-26 00:00:00,2,"Thought I would like this based on the strong reviews it's had, but ended up unimpressed and disappointed. The characters weren't developed enough for me to care about them, the dialogue was rambling and opaque at times, and the setting and plot made little sense to me. Perhaps this puts me in the minority, but it is definitely a movie that I wouldn't recommend."
" Tired, boring old tropes.
",-0.6369,0.8701,2020-07-26 00:00:00,1,"White power skinheads make up 0.0000001% of the worlds population. (Add a few more zeroes actually.) yet make up 99% of all on screen antagonists. This is another example of lazy script writing, bad production and predictability in story. I've had a bad run of bad movies lately but am trying to find something positive to say. Imogen Poots is pretty. Not pretty enough to make this worth watching though."
" I hated this movie..
",-0.6369,0.2731,2020-07-23 00:00:00,1,"Definitely i have better movies to watch out, and Green Room is such a waste of time considering the tons of movie which are quite better than this. Movie is dark, and hard to follow what's is exactly going on. The director has messed up with their faces leading to more confusion. Greater the darkness, greater the confusion. This movie ain't horror thriller genre, it is a psycho horror movie, so misleading even with the genre it belong to.Weak and useless plot, uninteresting leading me to to rate it the least."
" Forgettable
",0.0,0.9788,2020-07-20 00:00:00,5,"Often dull, muttled, and slow- Green Room proves to be anything but thrilling as it makes its 90 min runtime seem like 3 hours long. The performances are for the most part mediocre, with everyone being as little enthusiastic about their roles as possible, minus the performance of Alia Shawkat as Sam. I'll give the film this, it isn't predictable, but what could be such a tight and gripping thriller, feels like they are dangling strings and waiting for someone to pounce at it. It's boring, very little of its work is successful, and I felt as if I wasted my time. The look of the film I enjoyed, although low budget, it felt gritty and true to the feeling the film was attempting to convey. It's script is messy, although it can make for some flashes of suspense and fun action, mainly towards the conclusion. In the end however, Green Room is not a film I plan on watching again anytime soon, or possibly ever. Its slow and muttled, and though it has a handful of good moments, it mostly is just another forgettable film with an intriguing concept.
My Rating: 4.25/10"
" Blunt, Topical, and Grimy
",-0.4215,-0.998,2020-06-24 00:00:00,8,"A down-on-their-luck punk band find themselves trapped in a neo-nazi bar after a last minute gig goes horribly wrong. The movie takes its time initially, establishing a real sense of place and atmosphere. We never really get to know our cast of characters all too well, but character complexity is traded for situational complexity. There is more going on under the hood of this film than initially meets the eye and we unearth its insidious machinations alongside our earnest, yet occasionally dimwitted heroes. About halfway through the runtime, things take a turn for the worse. Green Room isn't kidding around. The tension is unrelenting and the violence is extreme yet realistic in its depiction...which only makes it harder to witness.I consider myself a fan of the horror genre and I wouldn't really consider Green Room to be a horror movie...yet I certainly had difficulty watching some moments. Overall, the movie is brutally nihilistic in execution. It hammers the audience with waves of sickly anxiety, dead serious, brutal, and single-minded in its aims. But then, at the last second, it hits the audience with an unexpected laugh out loud joke and cuts to the credits. It's certainly a ride that's not for everyone. Some movies lose impact and relevance with age, Green Room is NOT one of those movies. The longer it's around, the more layers it gains.Several months after Green Room's release in the states, the star of the film, Aton Yelchin was tragically killed in a freak accident. Couple this sad circumstance with the reality that we exist in a time when neo-nazi's openly march in the streets and the president of the united states has white supremacist ties and, well, Green Room packs quite the incidental punch in addition to it's intentional ones. A character's ignorance early in the film about the political leanings of white-supremacists has dire consequences. He's not sure what they are, he thinks they're either far right or far left but he doesn't know and doesn't care. His perspective matches that of many people today, the film through this lens acting as a vinegar rebuke to willful political ignorance. Current revelations about sexual abuse or poor treatment of workers in the entertainment industry adds further relevance to Green Room's central point of conflict. When spending money on music, movies, or products in general; we aren't thinking of the views of those BEHIND the music, movies, or products. But if we ended up being the ones victimized by said people, our consumption habits would change in a heartbeat.The punk band doesn't share the views of the skinheads at the dive they're playing, they take a big gamble by making a huge point of it. But they do intend to profit from them, this choice has consequences. There are characters who are trying to get out of the white supremacist group altogether and one who wants to stay in the community because she likes the music but, in her own words, isn't a neo-nazi. Green Room is cut and dry with it's messaging. Once you're implicit in evil, no matter how far removed from it you think you are, it's going to catch up with you in the end. It's terrifying, it's disgusting, it's riveting, and (for the right audience) it's utterly worth watching.So, should you see Green Room? If a nail-biting thriller with realistic gore, razor barbed social commentary, and a haunting Patrick Stewart; all marinated in a grimy punk rock/hardcore music needle-bath sounds like a roller coaster tailor-made for your particular brand of weird. Then yes, sit on down next to me and please keep arms and legs inside the ride vehicle at all times.-Josh Evans"
" I'm sorry, it's just awful.
",-0.5106,-0.8934,2020-06-12 00:00:00,1,"Unlikeable characters, making stupid decisions. Clich√© vilains. I had a real hard time watching this mess of a movie. And I couldn't care less about what happened to any of these people, including the dogs. The script was nonsensical, some of the dialogue had me wondering why even bother? And the ending wasn't even justifying all the ruckus that happened throughout the movie."
" Extremely entertaining and brutal.
",-0.2893,-0.5423,2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Tense horror film that dedicates sufficient time to developing its narrative and not a second more; the descent from naivete into pragmatic ferocity is as compelling as the tightly crafted setting. Stewart is great as the restrained, effective, 'socialized' Nazi, who orchestrates the cruelty rather than partake of it himself. The realism distinguishes this outing from later A24 horror from the likes of Aster, which would incorporate supernatural or psychologically twisted elements almost by default."
" Well worth watching despite typical suspense-flim plot holes and blunders.
",0.4588,0.8595,2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,"I'd never heard of this movie before, I don't generally care for this genre, and nothing about the description made me think I would enjoy Green Room, but it was well rated when I looked it up so I decided to watch it anyway and I was very pleasantly surprised by how good it was.This sort of movie is usually full of plot holes so big they ruin they completely ruin the movie, and though there are two glaringly obvious ones as well as some moments of very questionable reasoning, nothing in the Green Room had me giving the finger to the screen. In fact, not only was I able to get past these scenes and continue enjoying the movie, my biggest criticism turns out to be trying to end the movie with a joke that just doesn't land instead of with ""the orchard"" scene just a moment earlier that almost screams ""fade to black and roll the credits now"".If you can tolerate some very poor medical knowledge, a repeated ""try using that thing right there"" blunder, and magic dogs, Green Room is one of the better suspense films and worth watching."
" Mystery of one and done bands finally solved?
",0.2732,-0.9691,2020-05-30 00:00:00,8,"No label punk band living out of a van while on the road for shoestring tour wind up in a very bad situation. After the last gig is a bust and short gas money to get back home they get a line on a walk-in that will net them the cash to return home. The off the beaten path country bar for old school skins turns out to be run by an organized 4th Reich gang. The set finished they are on the way out the door when a forgotten phone leads to the night that kills the band.
I initially passed on seeing this based on blurbs that made the movie sound like yet another Hollyweird screed on how inbred racist white hillbillies are killing the world's love with their hate. You have to be pretty thick if that is what you take from this film.
This is a lean and solid thriller about coming afoul of criminal enterprise by happenstance. Characters are fleshed out just enough to set the table, the meal comes in the form of hyper realism of wound FX, believable violence, and an interplay between antagonist and protagonist that is refreshingly smart and gritty. Aside from sticking your arm out the door and splitting up the typical dumbassery that tend to sneak into movies of this type is refreshingly absent. No preaching, no virtue signalling. An organized concealed criminal enterprise with experience staying off the radar vs some fairly streetwise and tactical not going to be your victim targets.
And while the movie is absolutely worth seeing based on merit alone the inclusion of Patrick Stewart as leader of the gang is just the cherry on top not to be missed. If you are a fan of the genre don't let this gem slip by you."

Hardcore and ruthless; this flick will keep you guessing. The writers really delivered a gem. A raw dialogue with cunning discourse, the cast seemed tailored for such a script.Patrick Stewart gives us an in-depth look into his range and versatility, and as usual, does not disappoint.
A good young cast. Great performance from the late Anton Yelchin.The characters have great depth and arc. Good plot, shot well, superb acting, with a great noisy soundtrack.Watch this movie tonight.

" Bleak, violent survival film
",-0.5994,-0.9478,2020-05-21 00:00:00,8,"Green Room is a film that you have to be in the right mood to watch. It is relentlessly violent and incredibly accurate at depicting neo-nazi gangs. Jeremy Saulnier directed it and its definitely well made. The ariel shots early on are beautiful, and contrast with the claustrophobic setting that most of the film takes place in. The setup to get to the survival premise is kind of forced, and it seems as though some scenes are improvised (poorly). Also, the characters aren't developed at all. I obviously root against the Nazis, but thats because these characters are so vile, not because the ""heroes"" are interesting. All of that aside, this is a great survival movie. No one side has the upper hand at any point throughout the film, leading to tense moments. Be warned, however, the violence is intense. I've seen many a violent film, but the grittiness and realism of this movie is unlike most movies that try to be shocking. This movie doesn't try to be shocking at all, it is a simple survival movie that contains brutal violence. Recommend to anyone who enjoys, well, this movie isn't enjoyable at all, except Patrick Stewart as a neo-nazi is a fascinating performance, and almost bizzare considering I only really know him as Picard. Anyway, 8/10, it accomplished its goal of being a great survival film, but theres no character development, just a crazy situation.RIP Anton Yelchin"

" White Knuckle, Green Room!
",0.0,0.9482,2020-04-08 00:00:00,7,"In the tradition of unexpectedly good siege/survival films such as Assault on Precinct 13 and Straw Dogs comes Green Room from writer/director Jeremy Saulnier. It takes the typical victims being terrorized in a ""cabin in the woods"" and then cleverly keeps pulling the carpet out from under the expected generic tropes set-ups.Instead of demons/serial killers doing the dirty work, we have a band of skinhead neo-nazis, led by of all people, Patrick Stewart, generally underplaying his role neatly and only occasionally displaying his full evil intent. And instead of your usual mixed bunch of unlikeable teenagers being set upon, Saulnier gives us the four members of a punk band, the Ain't Rights, travelling through the Pacific Northwest. Desperate for money, they take a gig, they would have preferred not to have done, at the neo-nazi bar, situated in a lonely forest venue. Before they can leave after their gig, they find themselves attacked by the skinheads after witnessing a murder in the club's green room. Pretty much totally out of their depth and completely unsure about what to do next, they barricade themselves in the room, whilst desperately hoping to come up with a solution to their predicament.The major selling point of Green Room is that it definitely has an air of realism about the general scenario. None of the twists and turns that occur appear contrived. It's not spoiling to say that during the hours that follow the discovery of the murder, the band are joined by some resourceful allies, again occuring after a chain of logical happenings. The action and violence that we see occur isn't stylishly choreographed, but rather the sort of stuff we might imagine happening from opponents on both sides, unused to dealing out the rough stuff and then seeing the up-close results.Green Room serves as a reminder of how much of a loss, we suffered due to the way too premature death of Anton Yelchin. As the quietly spoken sort of leader of the Ain't Rights, he gives us a completely different character from that of his best known and much loved Pavel Chekov in three Star Trek films of the latest franchise and in the process demonstrates he knows his way around a bass guitar.Stewart and Yelchin get great backing from a veritable ensemble of a support cast with standouts for me being Imogen Poots as Amber, who proves to be extremely resourceful after throwing off her initial shell shock and Saulnier regular Macon Blair as Gabe, a club employee and Stewart's right hand man, who may not be quite so wedded to the cause as his boss.Both a critical and commercial success, Green Room is a dynamic, occasionally darkly comic, unusual take on a popular film genre and thanks to a gritty no holds barred authenticity, proves to be thoroughly entertaining. Make sure you don't miss the Ain't Rights, if they happen to be performing around your neck of the woods."

They all clearly have underlying motives for what they're doing and subsequently are all constantly put in fierce Zugzwang.
Everything in this movies makes sense. People simply do what they have to do and constantly try to shape their own luck.

The set up was believable enough and thought the actors did a good job however once the murder took place it went downhill. Y were the skinheads so upset about Emily and Daniel (think those were their names) leaving? Is there some sort of gang mentality, the only way out is a body bag? Like if they were stealing the $ or drugs, could definitely understand the skins killing them. In real life the entire situation would've been over in 5 minutes with skinheads overtaking the band. Many of the negative reviews claim the violence was gratuitous yet no one mentioned the overuse of the N word; which was Completely unnecessary. Honestly the Nazi characters were only important to the plot when it came to Amber recognizing the shoe strings; other than that they could've just been regular bad people.

" Saulnier hacks his way thru to the hall of fame
",0.4404,-0.9639,2020-01-07 00:00:00,10,"""Green Room""; an exceptional thriller/horror film from Jeremy Saulnier, who, believe it or not, comes from quite the humble beginning. From directing a singular location first film to using his own personal properties in his movies, Saulnier jumps up to the top tier of filmmaking with his junior effort ""Green Room"". This film doesn't only represent the greatest of horror films, bit it also stands as an epic departure for Anton Yelchin who was the same age as myself and who died at the age of the infamous number 27. Gripping, terrifying, and above all else, horrifyingly surreal, ""Green Room"" takes us on a comfortably gritty journey through neo Nazi hell and back again all while slitting our throats along the way. I couldn't recommend a better horror movie to anyone except for maybe ""V/H/S""(2012)...but the two are so different yet stand tall in their own category. ""Green Room"" a movie for the ages."

Great acting.
Authentic punk band portrayal.-
Not as suspenseful and extremely violent as its reputation says it is, although the film do has its moments."
" Not for everyone in more reasons than one, but quite satisfactory for those willing to see it
",0.5704,-0.9941,2019-12-29 00:00:00,8,"Let me just start off by saying: this movie has a REALLY cool premise. A punk rock band trapped in a bar fighting off neo-Nazis? Hell yeah? Intrigued me the moment I heard about it. And the end result was one hell of thrill ride full of great performances, brutal violence, and plenty of tension.All of the acting is spot-on. Nearly every character in the film is surprisingly charismatic, even the bad guys and they're damn neo-Nazis! However, that detail is justified by Patrick Stewart's chillingly amiable performance as Darcy, an elderly man who, despite his nonthreatening name and grandfatherly appearance, is hiding dark secrets of his own and plenty of complex plans that even I don't fully understand even after seeing the movie. Special shoutout also goes to the band members, especially Anton Yelchin. May he rest in peace.I don't really understand why the movie is considered a horror flick; it's really more of a thriller because of its slow tension, as I've noticed most A24 horror and thriller flicks often have. However, the movie most likely earns its certification as a horror movie because of its abrupt flashes of gruesome violence. And I mean it when I say ""gruesome"". The violence here isn't over-the-top, gratuitous, and unworthy of sympathy like the Saw movies for example. No, the violence in this movie is graphic, often hard to look at it, and unexpected, and there was one particular moment that nearly made me stop watching the movie entirely.The only main flaw I could find in this movie is that sometimes it feels like it can't balance itself between complex and simple. When it's too complex, the mystery elements lose effect or don't become interesting, resulting in the movie feeling slow at times. When it's too simple, some characters might make really dumb decisions, once again slowing the movie down a bit because you might be left wondering ""Why did they say/do that?"". This can be occasionally frustrating at times, especially since, as mentioned before, this movie has a very charismatic cast.In conclusion: this movie is supported by an intriguing premise, talented cast, and tension throughout; however, viewers without a stomach for graphic violence or slightly uneven pacing should take caution when watching this."

The idea for it always sounded interesting, so I decided to finally give it a watch and holy crap, it blew me away. This movie doesn't feel slow. A lot of the movie is character's just sitting around and yet it feels so high stakes. I watched this movie before shortly after realizing Anton Yelchin passed away. This movie has charm in a sense. It's a movie I could see myself watching every couple years. My only complaints with the movie are from a technical standpoint mainly. The main problem is some of the dialogue is ""mumbled"" making it hard to hear. My only other complaint is that realistically, none of the character's have a backstory. However I give props to the film makers for making them seem memorable and like they had a reason to be there. Green Room is a great film. The only reason I don't give it any higher then an 8 is that they don't explore things that they easily could have. If this movie was 10-30 minutes longer we could feel some emotional weight behind the characters."

May have started a little slow but I now think it helped with building the characters and getting a glimpse at who they are.

And, my god, if you've got Patrick Stewart to play your bad guy. And to be exactly how you would picture him as the big bad. Strong, confident but quiet. He played his roll wonderfully. I only wish enough were left alive for a sequel. I don't think two will quite do it.

This movie was ok; nothing more, nothing less.Patrick Stewart's role really wasn't anything major and it wasn't some spectacular performance. I don't understand why people talk about it like a selling point. He wasn't developed at all and was a pretty boring antagonist truthfully.All of the characters are completely flat and there is virtually no development. We have no reason to care for them. I realized that we really weren't going to get any development after about 15 minutes and thought that maybe there would be some cool deaths for them since that must have been the only reason why they were taking up screentime. I was wrong.The gore in this movie is honestly average for a rated R movie. Nothing is groundbreaking here. It's certainly not like Saw. Countless movies have more gore and do it better than this movie. Again, I don't understand people talking about how this is a gory movie. It's not. Every time you think you're going to see a really gory sequence, the camera cuts away and you wind up seeing nothing that wouldn't be able to air on cable for an R rated movie. It's stupid and frustrating for the viewer. Another problem is that most of the gore will also be shrouded in darkness, so you can't see anything.This movie has virtually no tension. It attempts to build it in some places, quickly to be destroyed. As a thriller, I expected psychological challenges and that style of horror, which would have made a supremely better film. Alas, it didn't and this movie merely exists.All in all: very average and mediocre in every aspect."

I should probably only have given this ""small"" film six stars, but one of my most important criteria for a viewing experience is that the film feel at least somewhat unique, which this film well-managed to do. I'm not exactly sure what else to compare it to, and I've watched everything from nature documentaries to ""chick flicks"" to horror franchises. ""Green Room"" starts rolling from the start, steadily builds up steam, doesn't take any easy ways out with the plot, and doesn't overstay it's welcome with too long a run time. Patrick Stewart though really seemed to be slumming and only in for the paycheck, since his performance wasn't particularly compelling versus the rest of the cast, yet he probably got paid as much as all of the others put together.

" A shattering film by a brilliant director
",0.5859,-0.9565,2019-07-10 00:00:00,9,"Jeremy Saulnier's ""Murder Party"" and ""Blue Ruin"" are among personal favorites of mine. ""Green Room"" further explores Saulnier's theme of ordinary people driven to extreme violence by situations both in and out of their control. It is refreshing to find in ""Green Room"" that the bad guys are not made to be any more competent at violence than are the victims, nor are they made out to be superhuman, hard to kill, or without fear and reticence. Saunier makes the Neo-Nazis human, not caricatures. He does not make them sympathetic, don't get me wrong, but in making them mere mortals, the film is vastly more interesting and realistic Speaking of realistic, the explicit violence is rendered expertly and has the capacity to effect even the most seasoned horror fans out there.

",0.0,-0.95,2019-07-04 00:00:00,3,"None of the characters in this film made any sense, and the way the Neo-Nazis tried to kill them was the most incompetent plan I've ever seen. For example, Patrick Stewart kept saying things like ""we need to sprint now"" and things to that effect, implying that they need to kill them quickly, but at the same time, he would only send in like 1 or 2 guys to go do it, and didn't learn from the fact that they would come back without killing everyone each time. The script was awful, and things just didn't make sense, especially the blonde girl. She went from the character of a crying, scared girl to the character of a capable, slow walking killer in just a few minutes. They also kept returning to the ""desert island band"" line which was neither funny or symbolic of anything. The reason it's a 3 for me and not a 1 is because of the exposition."

" Unapologetic for All the Right Reasons
",0.0,-0.9951,2019-06-20 00:00:00,9,"Because the horror movie genre has a wide array of themes to tackle, be it supernatural or psychological, it only makes sense that some filmmakers choose to tell down to earth stories with it based on the horrors of our world. In the case of Green Room, it delves into a more realistic tone to reveal just how horrid some parts of the American society can truly be. After it premiered at Cannes in 2015, it got a wider release in 2016 to rave reviews. Even though it didn't perform well financially, it's definitely a flick worth being deemed as a classic in the future just for how little it holds back just to give its own two cents on certain individuals.The film centers on a punk rock band who get attacked by neo-Nazi skinheads after witnessing a murder performed at a remote club in the Pacific Northwest. The film cleverly lets the uneasiness transition in smoothly, as the band are already aware they're performing for this infamous group. It isn't until the aforementioned murder happens when the stakes really get intense, as the band are all held hostage at the hands of these psychopaths. As for the plot itself, it mainly focuses on both the band members trying to figure a way out of the place and the skin heads figuring out ways to kill them quicker. While the pacing can drag on at points, it still works in service to the unpredictable tension that plagues the fear all around the member's escape tactics. The only legitimate critique on the story's front is that the ending feels somewhat anti climatic, although I imagine it's how most would seek vengeance on others.As long as you have good characters, they should be worth rooting for in such dire situations, and the film features a successful cast. In terms of the band members, Pat, Sam, Reece and Tiger all have their own disagreements with one another but still do their best as a team to solve any given dilemma that hits them. By thinking ahead around the obstacles in their path, these people are examples as to why logic is necessary for escaping sociopathic slime. Arguably the most sympathetic character in the film is one of the murder witnesses Amber, given that she only became part of the nazi cult as a way of escaping a hellish life, only to go out of her way to get rid of such a past. While most of the skin heads are downright evil, the most sophisticated of them all is the leader Darcy. In addition to Patrick Stewart selling charisma on top of masochism, this guy is a brilliant mastermind to the point of always being on guard to stop any witnesses who may get in his sadistic ways. With a mix of moral and immoral views, all the characters remain memorable for different reasons.Now while the film was made on a low budget, it made good use of its limitations with fast paced editing, frightening lighting and the overall atmosphere. Given that there isn't a lot of music outside of some rock ballads and a quiet score, the scenes appropriately grate on the nerves with a subtle flow from the relatively calm moments to the inevitable massacring. It's necessary to let the scares come at a natural ease before suckering the viewers with them. Given the film's title, the actual green room area creates a very claustrophobic environment where you can never expect what will come at you, especially with the shadowy spaces where you can't make out anything. The usage of cutting the shots every five to ten seconds helps to heighten up the paranoia of being held hostage by fascist supremacists, as if it's all a reflection of the viewers being in such a psychotic situation. Without cheesy jump scares or obnoxious music, a setting can do all the work to freak people out.If there could ever be a horror film that can best be described as eye opening, this one would be that. By delivering unapologetic thrills with a surprising amount of intelligence, Green Room is the type of thriller that really opens up people to the real horror of the world: reality. While hate-filled groups have existed in America for centuries (let alone the whole world), we tend to forget just how badly they can affect the lives of others who are unfortunate enough to stumble upon them. Be it fiction or non-fiction, we need media to remind us of how ruthlessly savage certain groups like neo-nazis truly are, because if left unchecked, the more damaged democracy's reputation would become. Unless you can't stand to witness the brutal truth of the world, this film is a must watch for any horror fan or cinephile who wants to experience something out of the ordinary for the genre's typical standards. It may not hold back, but it will still make you think long and hard about our society."
" What did I just watch?
",0.0,0.9918,2019-06-04 00:00:00,4,"I came into this movie with high hopes. I love Patrick Stewart, and hearing his wife call this 'the scariest role he's ever played' was very intriguing. I had heard about the gore, and the intense atmosphere, and I even managed to go into the movie without seeing any trailers or reading any spoilers. I was pretty hype for a movie that could keep me up at night and make me see Stewart in a whole new light.
That is certainly not what I got.
It started a little slow, but that's to be expected with a lot of thriller/horror pieces so I gave it a break at the beginning. Things picked up a little once everyone was trapped in the green room, and I was still on edge for the moment when crap would hit the fan. The gore was as impressive and subtle as promised, the setup was nice and smooth, and the acting was actually pretty good too. Still had some high hopes at this point.
Patrick Stewart shows up. I'm ready to be intimidated and menaced. He comes in to sleaze his way into disarming the protagonists and dips. Good start. Still waiting for some real action, but we're getting there. At one point I paused the film to grab a drink, still anticipating a breaking point or moment of clarity for some character or another, and lo and behold, I'm halfway through the movie already!
I know what this means, and the disappointment sets in quick, but I manage to sit through the next half of the film. Literally nothing happens. Patrick Stewart has almost no presence, and to be honest neither does anyone else. We don't learn anything that would endear us to the characters or make us identify with them, so it's not much of a big deal when they die. Or when they win. The ending so anti-climactic that I actually rolled my eyes when the credits finally ran.
There are some good things about this film. The premise is good, the acting is believable, and the effects are fantastic. The way they presented and used the gore in this film is almost tasteful in a way; graphic, but not super gratuitous. Also the dog. The dog is really the best thing about this movie, and *SPOILER* I'm glad he lived at least to the end, though he is more than likely to die later.
After all the hype and positivity around this, I really wonder if I watched the wrong movie. I don't see any of the suspense, intensity, or masterful direction that so many other reviews rave about. Maybe I'm just not the audience this movie was made for? As a horror fanatic and lowkey gorehound, I wouldn't think that was the case. Maybe I need another watch to ""get"" it? Possibly, but I really don't see myself rewatching this one ever again. Oh, well. ¬Ø\_(-.-)_/¬Ø"

" Unlike anything I've seen before, and full of tension
",-0.3182,0.854,2019-05-29 00:00:00,10,"This is a fine example of crisis horror, and groundbreaking, much in the way Wolf Creek was groundbreaking when it came out. Like Wolf Creek, it introduces us to a diabolical baddie, this time played by an unrecognisable Patrick Steward. He's a million miles from Star Trek in this, and magnificent. His performance was intoxicating, and together with the wandering and constantly surprising story and script, hard to look away. In many, many horror stories we are used to a group of young people being picked off one by one. Green Room's originality is that although that's the case here as well, it is presented in such a way that you really won't be able to see around any corner. It's much more real than your average teen horror, in that no-one falls to pieces, although clearly terrified, and in that things actually happen as you'd expect them to in real life, chaotically and usually with everyone (baddies included) fumbling badly. No-one is really a hero, another brilliant aspect. Patrick is not the only baddie, here they come in all shapes and temperaments, and their scheming is diabolical. Everything is just so unexpected. All the performances are terrific, perfectly cast, and although nothing is groundbreaking in any of the film techniques themselves, they were obviously all professional and competent, as all you'll ever notice is the strange tale being told and being spellbound as to what the hell might happen next. It's full of classic new shivers this one, and Jeremy Saulnier deserves to be on people's watch list for creating a truly original against the odds piece of genius."
" Riveting and realistic
",0.0,0.988,2019-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Green Room is one of the best thrillers I have seen in some time. Going in, I did have somewhat high expectations because the premise itself is original and interesting enough to pique curiosity without seeing any trailers or clips.The beginning of the first act feels a little disjointed and I thought could have benefited from a little more exposition. We are kind of just thrown in to the lives of this band and expected to be empathetic towards them. This just didn't work for me super well and I wish more time had been spent on establishing a stronger emotional connection with our group of ""heroes"" per se.This is really the only major issue I had, and once the conflict starts it doesn't really matter...the lack of build up actually serves to increase the intensity in some ways. What separates Green Room from other thrillers is just how realistically they are able to bring this scenario to life. This could happen to ANY down on their luck band desperate for every dollar they can get. And it doesn't just do well with the setting, but it also does a great job in shifting the tone in a dramatic way, as many real life traumas happen themselves. The other shoe drops in the blink of an eye and we are immediately transported from a run of the mill scenario to one that is life or death. Yes, they make ""stupid"" decisions that are cliche of a lot of movies like this, but in this case it feels natural because the emotional tension is so strong that it reasonably prevents anyone from thinking critically.From the moment the conflict begins, my heart did not stop pounding throughout the course of the film's runtime. It is incredibly tense and quite frankly terrifying. There is some extreme violence that may detract from the viewer's experience, but I did not feel that it was too over the top and thought it was done well in order to create the type of tone the creators were likely trying to establish.The performances here are awesome. The major standout for me was clearly Anton Yelchin...simply fantastic...followed closely by Imogen Poots and of course, Sir Patrick Stewart. Stewart's character honestly felt a little underutilized. I would have loved to have seen more. Even so, he kills every scene that he is in.Overall, despite its lack of exposition that would have improved the narrative a little, Green Room is one of the more terrifying and intense thrillers I think I've ever seen. It is very well-crafted and, due to its subject matter, just as thought provoking as it is purely entertaining.Rating note:
I sat on the fence between 8 and 9 for a while. For right now I'm giving an 8/10 because I really did want more emotional and interpersonal connection to the protagonists. However, it is a lot closer to a 9 than most 8's I have given in the past and could easily see this evolving into a 9 for me over time or after an additional viewing."
" ""And if the cherry does something you don't like... shoot""
",0.2584,-0.1067,2019-04-25 00:00:00,9,"The story of Green Room directed by Jeremy Saulnier is about a group of punk kids in a band called The Ain't Rights"" endlessly determined but down on their luck, thrown into a situation that is completely out of their element. The cast and band includes Anton Yelchin, Joe Cole, Alia Shawkat, and Callum Turner. They all encapsulate their character very well and all have their own quirks and rebel attitude The movie is always unexpecting and Saulnier takes it to a level of believability with its utter brutalism, character interactions and the routine of a largely neo-Nazi club when a girl is murdered at the club. The characters intensity and impulsiveness during several key moments makes it feel all the more real. The clunky dialogue and clearly strung out disposition of the actors do a great job trying to cope with their current situation shouting out a bit of their personality with every line. But ultimately their band is outnumbered and betrayed to. The performances across the board are great and you get an understanding of what their like even at the very beginning. You can see who stands out and who stays more in the shadows.
Green Room's directing which is my favorite of Saulnier's filmography has slow moving camera-work that usually mirrors the character's movements directly behind them or over-top. There's sweeping shots to show the progression of characters riding to a parking lot to siphon out gas. The camera seems to push through the grass when they lay down the bike down and run up to the car. The bird's eye view of the car driving through a highway along the ocean feels so alive and visceral. Then again towards the end when the characters finally escape from that place it feels like we're getting a breath of fresh air and that vast green landscape that seemed so far away comes flooding back. The way he's able to create such a bleak view of an isolated punk club amongst this vast luscious landscape is a feat. Even similar to Jordan Peel's direction with Us he's able to bring tension to a place like the beach or for Saulnier the forest. He brings this world to such a point of realism that when Alia Shawkat's character Sam leaves her charging phone in the backroom and discovers a dead body the tone and undertones of music bring it crashing down. We are right alongside her and her desperate plants of escaping. She obviously tries to call the cops right away but is stopped by one of the skinheads and trapped with people who they have no idea of what they're capable of. The aspirations of the band and everything we once knew are thrown to the wayside and their forced to deal with the situation right in front of them. Joe Cole's character Reece especially steps up the plate and tries to do what he can to hold a large man down. The other band-mates are losing it. They're stripped of the facade they've been portraying to keep with their punk roots and what they stand for. The overlapping chatter, and the frantic nature of it all is captured extremely well. The directing feels so effortless and continually flowing to the point where I forget there's someone behind the camera. It doesn't needlessly draw attention to certain aspects/characters because the interactions unfold on their own.Patrick Stewart as the lead of this cult has a commanding presence. He's well mannered and vulnerable. His true colors and the frustration he feels comes through.. Stewart's lingo along with the other members of his organization is sometimes alarming but always feels common to the other character. Even when what he's saying is blatantly racist and further delves into a world rarely shown on film. Stewart never has a true moment of completely breaking down when he keeps losing men. Like so many other Hollywood flicks. It separates him from the crowd and becomes unbelievable intimidating even when his more human side is shown. Like when he asks the group trapped in the room to elect one voice to speak and to speak softly because his voice is getting hoarse. It's almost awkwardly funny in a way but that inescapable tension remains.Anton Yelchin as the eventual lead in one of his last rolls is a trembling, terrified kid. His shaky somewhat raspy voice really personifies the fear that must be rushing through his veins. You feel for these passionate punks who clearly have a message and love what they do. Their facades start to break and that once impenetrable wall crumbles. I've never seen a movie that tackles such an immense topic of adolescents trapped in a room with a dead body with a realistic human element as well. Imogen Poots as well has plenty to offer. Her slick delivery, slouched disposition and slower movement adds to her overall character and ultimately makes her a force to be reckoned with. She knows more about the current situation overtime than anyone involved and it's smartly revealed to us. Plus the recurring theme of ""desert island bands"" that the band jokes about at first and can't come to a conclusion about it, makes for a very satisfying closing scene that I won't spoil. In conclusion. I'm always discovering more about a world that feels so scarily tangible with it's themes, violence and dialogue. I hope that Jeremy Saulnier continues to make films that push the envelope, warrant repeated viewings and delve into worlds/characters that are rarely shown. It's a film that I highly recommend."

He's got a whole career ahead of him and I hope he covers every spectrum of the rainbow. But I digress. Green Room is good, but you need the stomach and patience to sit through it. Whereas Blue Ruin was brooding and violent, Green Room is less brooding and way more violent. The plot of the film is ingenious in it's own right. A punk band performs a gig at a skinhead compound and are held hostage in a night of terror. The band is in too deep. They've seen too much, and the skinheads want to do anything to bury the evidence, even if it means killing them all. Dark, dark, dark. Darkness consumes this movie. Either the subject matter begins to grow on you, or it doesn't. But I went with it, and for that, I wasn't disappointed. Also, kudos to Saulnier for casting Patrick Stewart and forcing him to cover up his English accent, with hilarious results."
" An overrated horror film... Yay...
",-0.5719,-0.9937,2019-02-23 00:00:00,2,"I had high expectations going into this movie considering people called it one of the best horror films of 2015. It also starred Anton Yelchin and Patrick Stewart, two actors I like watching.However, about halfway through this film, I started getting pissed off. There was little to no action going on except for some characters talking, or mumbling, and that was about it. When there was action, it didn't last long.Speaking of which, the deaths were incredibly lame. I don't know who sat at the Board of the MPAA when this film got rated, but the MPAA rating explanation isn't too accurate. This film got R for ""strong brutal graphic violence, gory images, language and some drug content.""Was the violence strong? Not really, no. Was it brutal? Heck no. Was it graphic? A little bit. Was it gory? Kind of. You want strong and brutal violence? Go watch the 2017 superhero movie, Logan. The action in THAT movie was strong and brutal, not this excuse for a horror movie.Lastly, the ending was very very unsatisfying. The villain takes a single bullet to the head, which is beyond anticlimactic considering what he and his crew did to the main characters.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you are more into suspense rather than action."

The main reason that I wanted to see this movie is the cover itself, and the plot summary. It's one of the best covers all time and music genres like, death metal or punk are rarely represented in movies. But in this case, we have a band full of relatable characters and a really cruel society of nazi punks, skinheads. Then I found out, this is one of the last performances of poor Anton Yelchin. The characters are relatable, the visuals are dope (like in John Wick), everything happens for a reason and it's free from cliches. I absolutely recommand this title."

I was told this movie was going to be intense but I never really felt it because the pacing was as slow as a M. Night Shyamalan movie and there is no build-up of suspense for each death as they all happen very quickly (and they happen in bunches) so you never have the time to process them. One thing that did not escape my attention was the lack of background music which would have help create suspense and a better sense of dread. While some of the characters do critical thinking in the movie, often times I'm puzzled by their decisions as well, like at the very end when the remaining survivors were traveling with a hostage who they then let go so he can look for cops--the same hostage who was before helping his fellow bad guys clean up and cover their tracks.I don't know how this movie received such high scores on Rotten Tomatoes. I'm an Asian American and I'm the biggest advocate against racism so it was neat seeing skinheads get the tables turned on them but that is not enough to make a good movie."

I expected something full of adrenaline, violence, and tension, but nahh... Whenever movie get's close to doing something like that, realism kicks in and ruin's it. For instance, there's a scene where the crowds is going wild while the band plays their song, and the movie cut's out the music. You start thinking the movie will start delving into the mind of neo nazi movement, but movie throws it out the windows few minutes later. It is never explored as a theme, it's just there. We are neo nazis. We are bad. We do bad stuff. Then it shifts to a thriller. Then when you think horror will kick in, it doesn't. There is never that sense of dread or feeling helpless while following the story of our heroes. Not everything is bad though. There are some tense moments, and Patrick Stewart is in it, and he is doing pretty good job, and there are some cool ideas, but ultimately it fails to do anything really good. I'ts all over the place. Credits soundtrack is cool though. I would give somewhere in between 6-7 stars, but since I can't, I'll rather go with the 6. It's not bad or anything, but it just exists.

This movie is a when bad goes to worse situation. Mostly well meaning musicians are caught behind enemy lines, so to speak, doing a frightful gig for skinheads; only because they need the money. The gore and mayhem all seemed to unfurl realistically, which gave the movie a level of truth, that made it an even more bloodcurdling view: due to its realism.It's a really great horror/thriller film with a lot of cathartic moments.

It became less interesting, hard to understand at times, and also very gross. As I mentioned, this movie has a dark look - so dark that it was sometimes hard to see the characters's faces. There was no contrast to this darkness and it became a bit too much. The story ended decently and it definitely fits in with modern day thrillers/horror movies. I'm almost surprised that Blumhouse didn't produce it - that's the kind of picture it was. If you like those kinds of movies, you'll like this.

Not enough to ruin it, but neither enough to make it hugely rememberable.The actions of the main characters make sense, i wouldn't expect any clever survival tactics from a low-life punk-band, who isn't beneath siphoning gasoline from parked cars. At the same time it's a little hard to sympathize with them for the same reason. Even worse fares the nazi gang, who is out for their blood, but isn't all too smart about how. The threat-level is all over the place. At the beginning it is hinted that the four punks are massively outnumbered, but all confrontations boil down to a handleable two to three nazis at a time.The best about this movie is the gritty atmosphere of the nazi/punk-club, which is well executed onto the screen. Also the good acting.makes this rather watchable, none of the characters felt cheap and Patrick Steward can shine as a softspoken, but evil villain.But in the slightly above average story, the plotholes and the luke-warm ending left me unsatisfied."

If you want a brief respite from Hollywood's high-dollar, high-tech gloss then you will probably enjoy this depiction of a nitty gritty, down and dirty, all out, no holds barred fight for survival. Set aside a couple of hours and give this movie a watch. The acting was good, particularly from Patrick Stewart whose appearance in this Indie effort lent it some Hollywood 'depth'. The movie would have been just fine without him, but it was good to see him playing a cool part in a low budget show. Okay, there were a couple of 'oh-I-wish-I'd-had-my-eyes-closed-when-that-happened' moments but nothing too far out. As in ""Blue Ruin"", all the characters had a 'real people' feel. Highly recommended - by me anyway. On my 0 to 9 scale an 8."

The repetitiveness is agonizing. We get it; try to escape, fail, someone dies, back to the green room, repeat for an hour and a half. Plus the plot twist that ties it all together was more like a plot hole. I would only recommend this if you had nothing else to watch."
" Entertaining enough, often original, but also fundamental flaws.
",0.3818,-0.9281,2018-11-22 00:00:00,6,"The film opens cleverly both visually and narratively and we are quickly drawn into the current lives of Pat, Reese, Sam, Tiger, and Tad a band of earnest, starving punk performers. Through a series of mishaps they soon find themselves deep in the Northwest woods at a neo-Nazi rock club. And just before they can slip away, they witness a murder and are detained by management awaiting the boss Darcy. That's Patrick Stewart, who I thought did a pretty good Nazi. i'm horrible with faces while my son is quite aware, yet both of us kept thinking Walter White rather than Captain Picard. Which brings me to a point that I think a lot of viewers completely missed. Not surprising since it's mentioned off hand once or twice and never figures in the action for some reason. But it does go a LONG way to explain why Darcy is so intent on constructing a death scene somewhere else. And that is the flaw of the movie. It is so concerned with immersion in the moment - which it does very well - it ignores the basic rules of exposition. I have no idea which one is Pat, Reese, Sam, Tiger, or Tad and I couldn't even tell you which ones lived or died except that I looked it up. And while the 3-4 forays from the green room generally resulting in a furious retreat might be an ironic twist on the conventions, the geography of the place is equally hazy. There is a secret level, which holds and keeps Darcy's secret, and well maybe it's just another ironic dead end. But when the band finds the usual unexpected allie who knows the exits, they still wind up behind the bar for some reason. There is, of course, a cathartic conclusion, but even that leaves the worm unturned. For me, the main measure of a movie is whether it draws me in by avoiding obvious manipulations, clunkly tone, or pacing. And this did and was often clever and original. But it could have been a whole lot better if used some more of the old tricks to make us care about what was happening rather than just watching it unfold. So a six."

One could argue that that's the most honest way for a horror movie to present itself, but Saulnier is not capable enough to pull off a statement of that kind and make it into an interesting film. The acting is good enough to make the characters somewhat likable, but the writing destroys their efforts by not having even one conversation between them. Maybe most horro movies are hypocritical in the way they try to create endearing characters only to have them die, but if this is the alternative, maybe they should keep making them that way."

The film's use of colour is nice, the gore is squeamishly effective and the characters I began as indifferent towards, I ended up rooting for.Whilst watching the film, I kept thinking what the script must have looked like. Can't have been too compelling a read - which is made even more surprising given the presence of Sir Patrick Stewart. He is one of the stronger parts of the film, but at times it seems like the film's content made him feel uncomfortable. He hesitates and just kind of mumbles whenever his character swears, and all violence perpetuated by his character is really, really held back. Nevertheless he is still fun to watch.I really can't see myself watching it again, or any other films by the director for that matter - but for what it was worth, Green Room was over the top & pointless, but self-aware and just engaging enough to be worthy of a recommendation."

The cinematography is top notch. It is so well done that you cant stop watching even though your body tells you to stop.Something I personally consider to define a good movie vs a great one is how well they can hold a tone. A movie can have a lot of flaws, but if they can find a tone and stick with it or mold it as needed, then they know how to write a good movie. A movie can be fantastic in every way, but if the tone of the movie ever sidetracks, you can tell that they arent the best writers.This is tonally one of the best films ive ever seen. They kept the intensity there at the right pacing the entire time. It never lost its tone. It never fizzled out or sidetracked. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Theres no traditional corny horror aspects whatsoever. Its a thriller to the utmost degree. No sound-driven jumpscares. Although there are some jumpscares, they arent the stupid sound-driven jumpscares. These are actually scary and well done, and not just meant to surprise you with a loud noise.About the gruesome parts: Do not watch this movie if you can't take gore. The gore is well done though. Its as tastefully done as gore can be. Not corny and in your face. Its very realistic and they often use cinematography and lighting to hide it some so its not constantly overwhelming you. I personally am not a fan of gore, but it worked in this movie. The most ive handled is watching The Walking Dead. This is far far more intense and realistic."

It has a plot that makes absolutely no sense and bewilderingly bad performances from an otherwise decent cast. What's worse is that it generates no suspense but a fair amount of gore and a lot of noise and if that isn't bad enough it wastes whatever talent the late Anton Yelchin might have had, (he's totally miscast as a young punk), while Patrick Stewart should be thoroughly ashamed of himself for agreeing to appear in such trash. What's surprising is that writer/directorJeremy Saulnier had already shown his ablities with the excellent ""Blue Ruin"" so this marks a considerable come-down. We can only hope his new film ""Hold the Dark"" is an improvement or Saulnier's career is over before it's really begun."

I can enjoy a thriller and horror but I prefer psychological fear instead of being grossed out by all the gore. So if you are more into this kind of movies you may like it more.I mainly watched it for the actors in it. It was interesting to see Patrick Stewart as a head of this Nazi organization. Seems very out of his usual character. He also did a good job but he wasn't much on screen to tell. Anton Yelchin and Alia Shawkat are the other actors I knew. It seems they didn't end up having much space to act as I know them as better actors than in this movie.The movie isn't so much about acting it is about the pressure of the situation. And it was pretty promising before all the gore started. But as I said it may be liked by somebody else.

It had me shocked when the first encounter happened and it left me traumatized. I had to pause it a while, to regain my breath and consciousness, because it made me feel a bit dizzy. I usually don't bother with gore scene, with blood everywhere, or internal organs being pulled out, or chopping head, but it just this time feels so real.Tell me everything, the acting was so great. Everyone was on its portion, not too much and not less. The panic, the fear, the confusion was delivered very well. You can cry for them.
The story was not too much made up, not a crap literally, seemed making sense as well. 
The movie was violent and brutal, but not a kind of slasher one. I like the ending where they were not wasting time killing those bad guys. I mean, a movie usually took a very long time conversation before killing somebody, until something bad happened and turned the situation upside down. I hate that cliche. If you're looking for a decent thriller movie, this definitely should be on your number one list.
Never thought i'm gonna rate this movie a perfect score."

Either the actors slurred their words, couldn't open their mouths wide enough for clear diction but I suspect the sound recording was just poorly recorded. I liked the characters, enjoyed the music, scenario etc, the script was good, what I could hear of it anyway. One third in and I was engrossed. Then the graphic violence started. Sorry but I just couldn't watch the scenes with the dogs. I like horror films and gore but these scenes were far too much for me. There was no suspense. When nearly all of the band members had been chewed to death by the dogs, what was the point in watching the remainder of the film? I lost interest. The final straw was the scene with the only survivor of the punk band sitting with the character played by Imogen Poots. The dialogue was cringe-worthy. I fast forwarded to their escape scenes and was glad the film was finally over."

It begins to devour cliches from movies of the genre (expect the dog, the dog was a good touch) including the very classic ""the hero turns as bad as the villains"".The real deal of the movie (besides the toxic, opressive atmosphere) is Patrick Stewart, because he plays a rock and roll germanophile negative nazi leader, and also wears a sweet hat."

The quality of the film also seems to flick into action at the same point, what starts off as a slow and padded beginning transforms into a slick, well acted movie. Patrick Stewart is excellent, very menacing in a subtle way, but star of the show has to be Imogen Poots, who is fantastic.

But what they don't know is that the gig is supposed to be held at a neo-Nazi bar. There were plenty of ""red flags"" that they should've noticed right from the get go. But I guess they really needed the money. So they perform their songs and as they're about to leave they witness a murder through an unfortunate turn of events. All the sudden they find themselves in a problematic situation; now that they've seen the murder they can't just be let go. For the majority of the movie the protagonists find themselves trapped in that one room; the very room where the murder took place. First against their will. Later on however as the circumstances change they stay in the room for their own protection. Things start to escalate as the owner of the bar starts to prepare for the worst case scenario. The constant tension and dread is palpable. After all the protagonists are nothing but a bunch kids (figuratively speaking. They are teenagers) trying to survive in this hostile environment. Meanwhile their captors are armed and dangerous. Which becomes very apparent as the movie progresses. This isn't their first ride at the rodeo. They have clearly done this before."

There's just so much junk out there with a relatively high rating of 7 or more, and when you watch it, it's just a total letdown.Take this movie for example. It's billed as a thriller/horror, yet at no moment is it ever scary or gory. The characters are bland and one-dimensional and you don't care if they live or die.The plot is just a joke. In the middle of nowhere in Oregon, there's a bar, where all the yokels, racists and neo-Nazis congregate. What, I guess BLM or Al Qaeda were too busy to take part in the shoot? Or was it just more convenient to make white males the bad guys again, because you know they won't complain, unlike if they were to cast one of the previous two groups... even though white male supremacists commit what, 0.0001% of the violent crime the latter two do? So yeah, once you see who's cast as the ""bad guys,"" you know there was no real interest in making a semi-realistic thriller. This is just another hit piece from leftist Hollywood.The movie itself is slow. A band is locked up on a room backstage. Ooooh. Scary! Are you scared yet? No? OK, wait, a handful of neo-Nazis then tries to kill them. OOOOH!! Now you're scared, right? Yeah, I knew it! Yawn.... There are, oh, 7 deaths on both sides, before the laughable ending. Total letdown.The only redeeming value is in the cinematography, as the guys holding a camera and doing the lighting knew how to film in the dark, and they had the wherewithal to not use the shaky cam fad that so many other movies do. Too bad they're dragged down by a stupid story and a snoozefest masquerading as a thriller."

There's minor character development (or perhaps it's just introduction); though, all the MC's are vapid jerks who couldn't be cared less about. The setup is somewhat original for a ""horror"" flick, even if it sounds like the premise of a bad bar joke (so, the Neo-Nazis and the punk band walk into a bar...). The most thrilling scene for the entire movie might have been Pat(?) getting his arm sawed into. I can't recall the names of the other characters, and the audio was garb√°j. Either the music and feedback were blaring or there were the mumblings of an inaudible dialogue. Tragic.After Pat's arm got mutilated, the whole production went down in flames. None of the characters were relatable or someone to root for, so each person getting brutalized felt like nothing. I couldn't empathize, and it made for an unbearable viewing. There just wasn't enough emotion (or any at all). No passion from the MC's, a washed out filter for the camera so that everything looked as lifeless as the characters acted, and no reason to care about the people being killed.I think my favorite part of the film was the mosh pit, to be quite honest. It had me nostalgic for a moment, because I used to love moshing at the local concert venue.Overall, Green Room sucked and was a waste of time."

The atmosphere is dripping with bad vibes and simmering with an undercurrent of violence, and this feeling is mostly thanks to a convincing cast and some tautly engineered direction. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the cast is Patrick Stewart as the neo-nazi establishment owner who coldly calculates the demise of our main characters. Once you get past the fact that it is Sir Patrick (The Sci-fi Nerd King) breaking some bad, he really is quite chilling to watch.The film has several disturbingly violent sequences that escalate with each new confrontation until a fairly scattershot climax and it mostly makes for a tense watch. However, because the characters aren't explored in any significant way it supplies us with only superficial thrills via the visceral nature of the violence depicted and the fact that we naturally prefer that the underwritten heavy metal rockers win out over the underwritten nutball Nazis who are trying to slay them. It's ultimately just a dirty indie remake of John Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13', but it does a good job of living up to its heritage."
" It doesn't deserve all of the hype.
",0.0,-0.9976,2017-10-21 00:00:00,2,"From the reviews that I saw online, it seems that this movie had gotten a lot of hype. So I decided to rent and watch it. And to be frank, it was a disappointment. The characters are one dimensional, boring and stupid. There are barely any character development whatsoever and I cannot feel any pity or care for them, and trust me, I tried. The only characters whom I'm able to tolerate is the blonde girl, and I love the dog but that's it. The plot is extremely predictable, unsurprising and stupid. I don't understand the meltdown that the group have gotten into when they saw that dead girl, I mean considering the place they're in, and all the violence that are pretty much natural in a place like that, why the fact that there is a dead body is shocking!? And why do they have to be contained like that? If the Nazis are planning to kill them, they should've just shoot them all and get rid of the bodies, you know, feed them to the dogs or burn them or something. The movie itself is not even thrilling or scary at all. I know a plenty of horror movies that uses jump scares to their advantage, yet this movie doesn't even use a single jump scare and it had completely failed to scare me. There are a plenty of people who calls this movie violent and brutal, yet most of the violence are pointless and it's not even as brutal as other horror/thriller movies. An the end of the day, this movie is a waste of time and I regret spending my precious money and 95 minutes to watch this."
" A straightforward, technically brilliant and intense violent showdown
",0.0516,0.2355,2017-08-31 00:00:00,9,"Jeremy Saulnier kicks it up 10 gears from his minimalist revenge film Blue Ruin to offer a confidently paced, well written and strongly acted piece of stylised violence. Anton Yelchin is excellent in his unfortunate swan song, with Imogen poots playing the shotgun wielding heroine who joins him in facing off against ruthless neo Nazis. Patrick Stewart is just plain creepy as Darcy, while Macon Blair also does a great job as Gabe the henchman. I have watched this film about 6 times with different friends and family as I find it endlessly watchable, as it is gorgeously shot, with a great soundtrack, gut busting violence and a real bad ass vibe, while like his previous works doesn't glorify revenge or conflict and shows that it really is humanity's dumbest solution to our problems. Violence is messy, unpredictable and despairing, much like our characters unfortunate situation. And some of my favourite movies cinematography wise have been shot with ARRI's so those guys know how to make beautiful images. Jeremy Saulnier well done you made a visceral and entertaining piece of work, the best revenge movie I have seen."
" I neither knew nor cared what was happening
",0.2466,-0.9878,2017-08-10 00:00:00,1,"So there's this punk band who get a gig at a club for white supremacists and Nazis. After one of them witnesses a murder the whole band is locked in a room and have to survive attacks from lunatics led by Patrick Stewart. There are several members of this group and sundry others who are locked in with them. One by one they are bludgeoned, hacked, disembowelled etc often more than once each.Other ex-members of the band may be joining them from time to time. This bit is unclear but there does seem to be more bludgeoned bodies than band members so I think that has to be the explanation.Rather than do something simple to cover up the initial murder, the Nazis decide to make everything worse by killing everyone and, just to be sporting, they set about this in the most inefficient way possible. Despite having the opportunity to kill everyone easily at the outset they instead opt for a series of increasingly byzantine attacks giving everyone in their gang the opportunity to do more bludgeoning etc before having their heads shot off.In the end two people and a dog survive. They may have been members of the band but by this time I neither knew nor cared. I may have missed something in the middle when I dozed off but there was still bludgeoning, faulty decision making and people who may or may not have been in the band running around the screen when I came to.You might like it if you are a fan of a good bludgeoning and hacking. If not you will come away confused as to why anyone could think the plot was believable or indeed whether the film made any sense whatsoever. (Hint: it didn't)."
" Brilliant Tense and Candidly Violent Thrillride.
",-0.3612,-0.9528,2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"Green Room was without a doubt my favorite horror/thriller since The Babadook. While I enjoyed Get Out, I knew that I could only digest the film as a spectator rather than someone who has let their imagination take hold to what dangers lurk in a predominately white society; the lack of transparency and authenticity that one senses can lead to troublesome thoughts, and Get Out pretty much hit the nail on the head as a darkly comical satire with the format of a Hitchcockian thriller. Green Room not only brings it's action to live with a heightened sense of realism; developed characters with human-like nuances that make each person on screen feel real, no supervillains, everything being a situationally fight-or-flight scenario etc. it also takes the spirit of the punk scene and caters it throughout the film without missing a beat. While the film is brutally violent and shocking, it never delves into the world of nihilism that slasher films become codependent on (see Eden Lake).This movie is beautifully shot with no pretenses. There are no ""hidden messages"" and doesn't treat you like some poor sob trying to dissect a poem. It's an in-your- face thriller that takes place in real time and you have barely any room to catch your breath if at all. Along with The Babadook, The Descent, 28 Days Later, REC and Let the Right One In, Green Room will be held high amongst the movies of the early 21st century that will impress viewers (genre-enthusiasts and regular filmgoers) for decades to come."
" Rating: B-
",0.0,0.9907,2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"From that moment until the end, it's a disturbing and suspenseful movie, with the most captivating and intriguing plot of the year. This film has moments where I was almost unable to see some things ... How cool is that?! This disgusting type of suspense is so well placed in the movie because it needed to be like that, so it turned out to be a really amazing achievement in directing.For the first time ever, not caring about the characters wasn't a problem for me. The band's members are really stupid, they are that clich√©-type of innocent people doing the dumbest things possible. You don't want the whole band to be murdered in cold blood, but you don't really root for anyone. The director already assumed that he's doing an ""inept protagonist"" series, where the main actors portray stupid people that make bad decisions and they will have to suffer the consequences. Not sure if I should feel disappointing or just OK with it.The continuous suspense kept me on edge all the time and that is also due to two amazing performances: Patrick Stewart as Darcy and Anton Yelchin as Pat are really great. Now, I have a problem with Patrick Stewart and with the time that his character has in the movie: he's not well utilized, he doesn't have THE scene where I'd be so fascinated that I'd re-watch it a thousand times. He is so intriguing and so captivating that I just wish I could have seen more from him. Also, the mystery throughout the movie (""red laces"") and the constant twists increase the suspense so much that keeps me on my toes until the end.Green Room is a great film, it's suspenseful, has great performances, but it could have had smarter (or not that dumb) protagonists and it should have had more of Patrick Stewart's character.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"

Specially because i use IMDb for choosing movies. Usually i get it right but with this one i was wrong. The acting is terrible! The situations are just not credible....make you feel that the protagonist are dumb.....i have not felt scared once in the 50 min. and the stupidity of the situations just made me want to stop this loss of time.

A departure for him in terms of roles but one he owns like only he can. This movie delivers the tension like no other. A perfect movie for fans of horror and punk. I felt a personal relationship with these characters being a touring musician.

After that, it became excruciating, terrible, etc etc ... plain old monotonous. It is also almost as s...l...o...w as Blue Ruin, though Blue Ruin is a far better movie. A bit of the dialogue between Yelchin & Potts was the main redeeming feature here. One last thing, wasn't it hilarious that Yelchin, who discussed being lousy at paintball, became a true marksman when he got a pistol in his hand? Doh!!! He has a mangled arm. He hasn't slept in 20 - 24 hours. He admits to not being good with a gun. But, DANG, he never misses with that pistol ... clean head-shots at 20 yards. None of the people who carry guns all the time were half as accurate as Yelchin was. Hilarious writing."

" A Well Made Film, Doomed From the Start with an Awful Script
",-0.7269,-0.9976,2017-06-16 00:00:00,3,"Horror is a genre I often steer away from. Yet I'm always intrigued when a horror movie comes out that receives critical acclaim. See, I love horror. It is the most visceral and natural form of film making. This is why it's such a tragedy that the genre has been neglected by talent, and is often a cheap thrill cooked up as a quick cash grab. Like pornography. In fact horror is often a lot like pornography in the way that characters act in ways, not that advance their own agenda or reveal something meaningful about their character, but to allow further scenes of senseless pain and anguish to befall characters that, often, we are meant to hate. So naturally, when people I respect highly are attached to a project that sounds very different for a horror film, I can get pretty excited. Green room is about a band (spoilers ahead) on tour in their van. The movie starts out with some slice of life bits, that set up the characters and world nicely. They are not necessarily care free, but they are free. And the scenes are at least competently shot, directed and scored. They are broke. So broke they can't afford gas. They meet a mohawk touting punk rocker about a gig they drove here to play. It's canceled. They are screwed. So they end up getting scheduled for a gig at some place in the middle of nowhere with some far left and far right people.Well when they get there, it's a bunch of Nazi's. Scary freaking Nazis. Not a ""he was wearing a make America great again hat"" kind of Nazi. No, the actual kind of Nazi. So what do they do? They play their extremely original song ""Nazi Punch"" (I think that's what they said).I hate these kids. And as we've already discussed, that's a very bad sign.Anyways, they play their set and go back to the green room. A girl has been stabbed, they're all witnesses now. They're all told to wait. Patrick Stewart finally shows up, and he is a lot like Jean Luc Picard as a Nazi. The kids overpower and kidnap the guy watching them and take his gun, and they lock the door. Things are looking bleak, but Patrick Stewart will let the kids go if they just let him have the gun.Dumb.So they give up the gun (of course) and Anton Yelchin gets his hand mangled, and we get to listen to his very authentic and painful sounding cries throughout the entire scene. Now I knew this was not going to be an easy film to watch. And I was prepared for just this sort of thing. But to have it be from something so stupid, it undercut any emotional underpinning or deeper feeling I could have, other than visceral empathy. Horrible, wicked empathy. And I will congratulate everyone involved in this movie for helping highlight Anton's amazing work. But frankly, although it may have been difficult to watch, there was absolutely no payoff for doing so. Immediately, any tension the movie may have had was deflated. I understand that films sometimes require us to endure tragic things vicariously, but understand that tapping only the centers of pain in a film is like creating a dish that is all salt and no other flavor or substance. It's just gross, and unpalatable. Maybe it's unfair to this film, but losing Anton so recently has left a fresh wound, and I suppose hearing him cry like that may have rubbed where it was still raw. Full disclosure. But I will try not to let it affect my scoring of the film.I did sit through the entire movie, just to confirm it was bad from beginning to end. It was. Now a lot of people worked on the movie, and I don't see any flaws with how the movie is made. Maybe the actors could have been directed more strongly. I don't know, honestly I think it all just comes down to bad writing. Why Patrick Stewart and Anton Yelchin signed on to this script is a mystery to me."
" Brutal, Blood-Soaked Battle: Punk Rockers vs Neo-Nazis
",-0.7717,-0.9974,2017-06-15 00:00:00,7,"I was sold on GREEN ROOM the moment I found out Patrick Stewart is the villain. Not just any villain either, but the head of an organization of rural neo- Nazis. And, to keep the STAR TREK connections flowing, he and his skinheads are going up against a punk band in which the lead guitarist is played by Anton Yelchin who played the young Pavel Chekov in the 2009 reboot and onward. Then GREEN ROOM went on to earn a certified fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and I was excited. I love a good genre film and GREEN ROOM is a horror/thriller that will effectively keep you on edge. The film focuses on a small-time punk band called the Ain't Rights as they're coming to the end of a cross-country tour. They're a handful of die-hards in it for the music and embracing the struggle, driving all hours and siphoning gas because these gigs aren't paying the greatest. As the movie begins, they find themselves in the Pacific northwest when a promised gig proves to be a bust. Just as they're about ready to call it done and start the long ride home, their local contact promises them a better venue and the chance for some decent cash. The only downside: they're playing to skinheads. Just keep it cool and don't play anything that'll set them off, and it'll be fine. The gig, at a private bar in the middle of the Oregon wilderness, goes well enough, but one wrong move on their way out ensures they won't be allowed to leave alive.The band finds themselves trapped in the skinhead bar's green room with the owner (Stewart) at first trying to reassure them that everything will be fine, the police are on the way, and soon this whole ordeal will be sorted out. Meanwhile, the neo-Nazis have a secret to protect on this property and that means these scrawny rockers can't be allowed to ruin their operation. What follows is a brutally violent battle of punks vs. Nazis where the Ain't Rights are going to have to force themselves out of their comfort zones and face death head-on if they plan on seeing their way out of there. The band consists of Yelchin with Alia Shawkat, and relative unknowns (to me) Joe Cole and Callum Turner. It's the band that sells it and makes this movie, at times, pretty painful to watch. They give the band a grounded realism as your average aimless youths with nothing more in mind than getting drunk and playing their music So when these stone-cold killers come at them armed with machetes and trained attack dogs, they react with a very real panic. These characters aren't action heroes. They're still practically kids and this is a very real danger for them. So, when they get the nerve to finally try and turn the tables on their enemies, it's sloppy and often ineffective, and when people start to die it provokes a gut reaction, unlike a lot of other slasher films out there where you're too detached to care about the heroes.It's a treat to see Patrick Stewart as the villain, especially one as horrible as this. His character, Darcy, is the head of this operation and storms on to the scene once his lieutenants alert him to the problem of a pesky corpse and the police having been called to the scene. He operates with composure and he's got a plan to make sure all of this goes away before it can destroy everything he's worked to build. He's soft-spoken, though that may just be because Stewart's slight southern drawl barely conceals his underlying English accent, but the character's realize early on that he's not your average gentle old man. Adding to the sickly feeling of uneasiness in the film is the sharp cinematography of Sean Porter. The whole movie has a dim, overcast feel evocative of the rainy northwest (whether that was a decision or just a result of filming in Oregon, I don't know but it works) and, of course, the movie has a greenish hue due in part to the use of fluorescent lighting in the bar and the rich greens of the surrounding Oregon forest. It works in conjunction with the film's grimy characters and bloody violence to give GREEN ROOM the nightmarish quality it needs to put your in the minds of these innocent punks who've been dumped in the worst case scenario and might not live to see the sunrise."

" Heart-pounding thriller
",0.1027,0.994,2017-05-31 00:00:00,6,"Green Room was a white knuckle thrill ride for me. It takes hardly no time to really get started, and once it does the suspense barely lets up. This movie has the perfect cast, superb pacing, and characters you root for. It doesn't rely on gore or jump scares to get your heart pounding (although there are a couple instances where you can't help but be shocked). Each character feels like their own individual and they all seem like real people with genuine reactions to what's happening. This is great film making and I wish Hollywood was more into making movies like this. It was heartbreaking to see Anton Yelchin give such a great performance knowing he's gone; he had such talent and this film proves it. Green Room does an excellent job at making you wonder what's going to happen, who's going to make it out alive, and who is trustworthy. I love movies that use genuine human emotion to involve the viewer, and this is one of those movies."
" Imogen Poots stole the show for this viewer
",0.0,0.9903,2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"I just wanted to say -- Imogen Poots, who played the role of Amber - - absolutely stole the show for this viewer. Sifting through other reviews I saw that her role and performance wasn't received all the time quite as highly as her role & performance did for me, to say the least, but if I dare say it her character will go down as one of my favorite film characters...ever. Seriously. Her deadpanned and detached delivery was absolutely classic, and on a few separate occasions during the film had me in absolute stitches. She was freaking great and I thoroughly enjoyed watching her perform in every scene that she participated in. Anyway, as for the film itself -- I thought the direction bordered on excellent, maybe not quite excellent but it came close to it in spots and I'll certainly be keeping tabs on this director and his projects going forward (Jeremy Saulnier). The cast was really solid and all for the most part delivered plus performances. The suspense was thick and all in all, just a wildly entertaining film from start to finish. And speaking of, they kept it short (clocking in at 95 minutes) so it didn't drag on like so many films tend to do. Rented it on Amazon, which gives you a 48 hour window, and in that window I actually watched it three times. Which is a rarity for me. Heck I'll probably even end up purchasing the Blu-ray. It's really graphic in its violence so know that going in. Good performances from the cast. Good direction. It's not a perfect film by any stretch but at the end of the day, it was a whole heck of a lot of fun. Which is the point to this entertainment thing, ain't it? 8/10 for me overall, but Poots' memorable turn as Amber, to me, is worth the watch alone."
" Filled with tension to the end
",-0.3182,-0.9855,2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"I liked the movie. I didn't feel the awe that so many of the reviewers reported, but the direction was spot on and the acting, too. One of my few complaints is that the film was too dark, in the way that it was hard to see what was going on. It was realistically dark, but a bit annoying. The second is that it was a bit slow; perhaps I was spoiled by non stop action flicks there, though.The plot revolves around this hard punk rock band that has a gig in a skinhead joint and they witness a murder. Trying to cover it up (and their heroin operation and whatever they were doing down there) the owner is attempting not only to murder the young people, but also to stage it in a believable way for the police.It was interesting in the sense that it felt very real. The situations, ironically, felt weird because no one was good at what they were trying to do. These were hard neonazi backwater hillbillies, but they weren't proficient at killing, they were afraid, they made mistakes. The members of the band were trying to survive, but didn't take the logical solution or even the hysterical ""let me out of here!"" clich√© that is so overused in thrillers, but had more human reactions that endeared them to the viewer.The scene in the end describes Saulnier's vision to the dot: ""This is a nightmare"", says a member of the band, ""For us all"", replies the leader of the bad guys. The ending is neither happy, nor hopeless, just ugly, dirty, leaving you with the same feeling the characters in the film, including the dog, had ""why did this had to happen at all?""."
" Seeing Green
",0.0,-0.9764,2017-05-28 00:00:00,5,"Coming across a corpse backstage at their latest venue, a punk rock band are a locked in a small room by the white supremacists who own the venue in this independent thriller from 'Blue Ruin' director Jeremy Saulnier. As per 'Blue Ruin', this is a fairly good-looking film with bursts of memorably graphic (and yet never gratuitous) violence, however, the protagonists here are nowhere near as three dimensional as the main character in 'Blue Ruin' and it is sometimes hard to feel for their plight, especially as it was their choice to accept the Neo Nazi gig in the first place. Of course, this might be a deliberate theme: delve into the world of white supremacists and you are playing with fire, etc. The film gets most of its power though from the basic premise of being trapped deep inside a place and having to force one's way out, which becomes even more critical since the band (rather conveniently) play off the grid and have told no one about their latest gig, meaning that it is just up to the Neo Nazis to work out how to dispose of their corpses in non-suspicious ways. With Patrick Stewart well cast as the eerily soft-talking owner of the establishment, the film certainly scores some creepy segments and there is nary a boring moment to be had. Those expecting something as intense and emotionally devastating as 'Blue Ruin' may, however, be disappointed."
" Awesome, does not deserve to be in the bargain bin
",0.7096,0.9812,2017-05-27 00:00:00,10,"What do I even say about this movie? It blew me away. It's the best horror movie I've seen this year, and my only regret is how long it took me to see it. This is the movie that ""Don't Breathe"" was trying to be; a survival horror that was unpredictable, intense, and just the right amount of shocking. I know survival horror isn't everyone's cup of tea, but for those of you who like the genre, put this on your list. The gore is done in just the right amount, never too much, but enough to keep you watching and invested. It is well-written, and acted perfectly, which is to be expected from Patrick Stewart and the late Great Anton Yelchin. The filmmakers know how to build atmosphere, so before the action even starts, you are already sucked into the world of the film, and you care about the characters you are watching. It doesn't go for shock value, but has a very real feel to it that makes it get under your skin in the best way. I'm sad to say I found it in a bargain bin of Blu-ray Discs, which is a crying shame as it deserves to be celebrated more than that, but which turned out to be a stroke of luck for me. I got it home, watched it with the BF, and found my heart racing almost the entire time, despite the fact that I was safe in my bed in front of our small TV. I am so glad I purchased it, and I will be telling everyone I can to do the same. It's one of the better horror offerings of recent years and I can't recommend it highly enough."

Human fallibility was embraced and displayed without any glossing or camera trickery.GREEN DOOR is a great, solid movie from the ground up. It is very violent with highly realistic injuries, but doesn't descend into torture porn territory. You will cringe in disgust a few times so be warned.As it was both written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier, he was able to retain total control over the project and it really shows.I enjoyed this film so much, I found it hard to look away.

" Gripping stuff
",0.0,-0.9924,2017-05-04 00:00:00,9,"Green Room starts out with a quick but pretty accurate portrayal of a small-time punk band on the road, bouncing from bad gigs to worse gigs. One gig has them playing in front of a gathering of backwoods skinheads (opening with a cover of Nazi Punks F**k off, no less.) And while their gig, in spite of its provocative opening, goes well, soon enough events happen that will make the night turn into a nightmare...And it's probably better not to say more. Green Room is a horror movie without all the hinges and tropes of horror movies. It builds tension at an uneven pace, throwing fits of crude, frontal violence at your face when you expect it less. And that's the horror this movie builds up to. An escalation of violence that leaves nobody intact. The use of space and unassuming direction seal the deal of a tough movie that stays with you. Needless to say, not for the faint of heart.Patrick Stewart, of course, is the casting's main attraction. And as usual, he does a stellar job, portraying an ordinary, scary monster. A guy that could be your friendly neighbour, if it wasn't for...So Green Room is a gritty, realistic horror movie, well directed and acted. Its off-kilter pace, while it could be seen as a flaw, serves the purpose of telling a story that doesn't attempt to embelish its violence or make it fun. If you're in for the ride, it might leave you a little punch-drunk."

The action element is relatively short and to the point. The scope of the movie is small but intense. Patrick Stewart has a small part but predictably plays it with great gravitas and really adds something.This movie is very efficient. It introduces the characters, lets you get to know them, puts them in peril, sets off the action, then ends. Perfect!No bells or whistles here just good honest film making.

" See only if you like seeing one group of people chasing the other and stay away from hype
",0.3612,0.9633,2017-04-24 00:00:00,5,"Since almost everybody's talking about the upsides of this movie, let me mention a couple of main downsides I found important.Green Room is a perfect example of how hype can ruin the entire movie experience. Mine expectations had been very high due to unexpectedly high critical approval and user ratings. I felt disappointed half-way through the movie.First, action is not at all fast paced or ample. From what everybody wrote, I concluded that Green Room must be something like Hardcore Henry; non stop mayhem put together nicely with music. But most of the actions is chopped and delivered in a few tense sequences. That's not necessarily bad but it surely slows everything down.Second, this movie is not even a horror. Several squeamish bursts of action don't make a horror. Atmosphere is intense as in any other action oriented thriller. When it comes to violence, I have to admit that it didn't feel extremely violent like everybody is making it to be. All of the violence is usually brief and happens as a part of some other occurrence (nothing like in SAW series).Third, don't expect good soundtrack even if you're into punk music. I looked forward to seeing a horror movie in which music may play some sort of pivotal role. Putting band on a spotlight really does seem like a good starting point. But no. A few screams now and there and that's all you're going to get.Would I recommend seeing Green Room then? Only if hype didn't already precluded you from having a realistic expectations and if you're looking for a no brain cat vs. mouse game. If you want to see something scary or intelligent, skip it and see something better."

Its beautifully shot and edited.As a fan of gore, and violence, I am happy to see someone who understands physics, and realism when it comes to wounds, and reactions. When someone gets shot in the head, the physics aren't exaggerated. Its funny. I had a friend who I argued with over bullet physics once. He believed that if you were walking forward, and someone shot you in the stomach with a 9mm pistol, you would be blown backwards. I couldn't get it through his head that you would just continue the way you were moving, and fall forward. The problem was that he had been brainwashed by false movie physics his entire life. Jeremy Saulnier seems to get it.I love the little twists and upsets that Jeremy Saulnier puts into his movies. It just makes the script that much more interesting, and stalls the story from flowing too fast."
" Saulnier's follow-up to Blue Ruin is every bit as thrilling
",-0.1779,-0.9736,2017-04-03 00:00:00,9,"GREEN ROOM is director Jeremy Saulnier's follow-up to the excellent BLUE RUIN, a low key thriller that came out nowhere to become one of my favourite American films of recent times. The good news is that this follow-up, despite being more action-packed and visceral, is every bit as good as BLUE RUIN and even more violent, if that's even possible.The story is quite standard here and more predictable than in BLUE RUIN, but the emphasis is on visceral thrills instead and on that basis it doesn't disappoint. The characters are somewhat unlikeable although Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots do grow on you as the story progresses, mainly through their refusal to give in to their oppressors. Said bad guys are a pack of Neo-Nazis led by a quietly frightening Patrick Stewart. The first 20 minutes aren't very interesting, but after a plot twist it remains exciting right up until the climax, just like a classic such as Walter Hill's SOUTHERN COMFORT.The single location setting is brought to the fore here by Saulnier's expert and claustrophobic direction. The violence is intense, extremely graphic, and completely disturbing with it. It's not a big blow 'em up adventure story, it's just as dark, gritty, and realistic as BLUE RUIN was, in which things never go according to plan and innocent people always get hurt. It's a mini-masterpiece of a film, and one of the most suspenseful I've seen in ages."
" Dire confined settings horror film
",-0.7717,-0.9795,2017-03-22 00:00:00,2,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A group of aspiring grunge singers unwittingly accept a gig at an event where a Neo-Nazi element is likely to be present. They soldier through it, and make it out in one piece, until they stumble on a murder and find themselves held against their will while the perpetrators figure out what to do. A battle for survival ensues, while the group await the arrival of Darcy (Patrick Stewart), their chief in command.It's still a very effective formula in horror films to have characters who start off in fairly controlled situations where something happens, and events spiral out of control, leaving them in a terrifying predicament that they never even dreamed of. And from this angle, Green Room had as much potential as any other, but Jeremy Saulnier's deathly drained piece is sadly an uninvolving, totally unsuspenseful thriller that you will struggle with to the end.It's as if the cast can sense how bad the screenplay and dialogue are, and most of it is barely audible, with all of them mumbling everything at a really low murmur, where you almost can't hear a word. This is complimented by an overly drained camera lens that adds nothing to the atmosphere. Performances wise, the late Anton Yelchin fails to stand out any more than any of the other charisma free young cast, and you know things must be bad when even the accomplished Stewart turns in a terrible performance, doing an unconvincing American accent.Not so much the Green Room, this one should have just been left on the Cutting Room floor. *"

Patrick Stewart as white supremacist nazi boss? Hell yeah! What a totally unexpected casting decision that totally paid off. He's super creepy and convincingly so. And Anton Yelchin is just always plain good‚Äî especially when playing the dorky but cunning type, as he does here.Plot-wise the movie manages to give the characters enough exposition that you care for them while also jumping straight into the action and ultimately keeping the suspense going for the entire time. Good job!But most impressive is the masterful cinematography. The very first few images tell you that this is a team that understands its craft: Lots of small little details are revealed about the characters with very few targeted images and cuts. Beautiful."
" A Bit Exclusionary, But Still Entertaining
",0.5927,0.9617,2017-02-27 00:00:00,5,"There is no doubt that ""Green Room"" is an exciting film, and one that will keep you entertained until the very end. Here's the thing, though: From a film studio (A24) that has produced some of my absolute favorite films the past few years, ""Green Room"" didn't quite measure up. I think the reason is because its punk-rock atmosphere leaves out a fair number of viewers who can't quite relate.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on the punk-rock band the ""Ain't Rights"", comprised of Pat (Anton Yelchin), Reece (Joe Cole), Sam (Alia Shaukat), and Tiger (Callum Turner). They are the typical ""struggling band"", siphoning gas from parked cars just to make it to the next gig. When that ""next gig"" happens to take them to a Nazi skinhead bar in Oregon, however, they witness an atrocity and are not allowed to leave (these people deal with things themselves). When the situation escalates, club owner Darcy (Patrick Stewart) is called onto the scene in order to control the chaos...and he is a man who certainly doesn't care if ultimate, violent force is used to get the job done.The most interesting themes of ""Green Room"" surround the skinhead culture of violence in order to make sure that problems are ""solved"" without ""outside intervention"". When the band members decide to fight back a bit instead of just rolling over in the face of threats, Darcy brings out a combination of dogs, weapons, and cold-blooded killers that can truly be chill-inducing. So, one could say that just the sheer, stark violence of the picture is a ""plus"" (if you aren't immediately turned off by it) in that it manages to be legitimately creepy and dark.The problem I had with this movie, though, is that I felt like I was kind of on the outside looking in due to the fact that I have no experience with clubs, live rock music, or punk-rock culture. That could be a ""me problem"", but I wonder if it also won't discourage others who might be in the same boat. It was just very difficult for me to relate to the characters, and that was a problem in a sub-90 minute piece that doesn't leave much time for character development.Also, ""Green Room"" is a rather stark departure from A24's more mysterious or mind-stimulating fare, instead opting for a shot of adrenaline to the senses. I prefer the former type of film- making, but those who more appreciate the latter will like this one better than I.So, while I was never bored with ""Green Room"" and indeed enjoyed certain aspects of it, as a whole it doesn't stick out to me as anything special (even in A24's own collection). Maybe I've just been spoiled by A24's tradition of excellence at the cinema that anything below that (or not appealing directly to my film tastes) seems a bit off. Either way, this one was ""just okay"" in my eyes."

I think that if you have a large gang of armed skinheads that are out to kill you and there are only two of you left unarmed there is no way that a girl with a Stanley knife is going to save the day. The film had a good story line at the start but just seemed to be rushed at the end and then making its mistakes even though it had a real good cast of actors.

" Punk's not dead
",0.5334,-0.105,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"""Green Room"" is a strange movie. It's sort of a horror-thriller, set among the apparently still existent punk subculture. The characters speak in slang that can be hard to follow and keep up with, and at times, it seems deliberately obtuse. Some of the dialogue made very little sense to me, and I was often left struggling to understand what was going on. There's a difference between making a movie sound authentic, and making it sound like a group of cool kids having a conversation in front of you they're determined to keep you in the dark about.I rewatched the beginning to see if I had missed anything in that crucial moment where the plot really gets going, and of course, I hadn't. Therein lies the problem: the story isn't confusing or complicated. It's just told in a way that makes you think it is. The plot is about a down on their luck hardcore punk band who are siphoning fuel to power their van on a tour through north western America. They take a last minute gig in a venue that is strictly ""boots and bracers"" ‚Äì ie. Skinheads, where their choice of opening cover is hilarious.While there, they see something they shouldn't have, and it becomes clear to them, if not to us, that they're not going to be let out without a fight. There are some things that happen along the way ‚Äì many things ‚Äì that add needless confusion to a fairly straight forward story. The movie does a great job of putting you within the punk subculture, but the basic plot could have been transplanted into any milieu.

" Complete Bewilderment
",0.0,0.9615,2017-01-21 00:00:00,3,"I never write movie reviews on this site. Now, I feel obligated to do so after seeing the Meta and User scores of this particular one.So, I've tried to decipher the reason behind the scores. Is it because Patrick Stewart stars? Am I missing something that makes this movie highly appealing to fans of metal? If i were to clutch at straws, was the marketing on point? Are the reviews from attendees of one or more of the many film festivals that also praised it in the form of awards? And this would at least explain the User scores; did raters watching the film post-death of Anton Yelchin allow their sympathy to override their logic?I am absolutely baffled. This film is SO similar to SO many mediocre- to-poor (of which this is the latter) horror/thriller films of the past that I almost feel personally insulted to see it receive feedback movies ten times greater in quality didn't even come close to reaching in the mediasphere.So shall we start on why this movie is such a common, run-of-the-mill substandard product that you'd rightly think of as just another cheap, formulaic horror movie the first time you laid eyes on it when browsing on-demand movie service collections? Let's.From the get-go, no effort is made to build or present the characters as likable; not helped by the dull, bored acting of the typical group of DUMB kids the movie focuses on. The plot, featuring heavy mention of the neo- Nazi cult the group of dumbasses fall 'victim' to breaks absolutely no ground, rather your attention span or desire to even care. A cast that would have benefited more from anonymity yet is filled by high-profile names such as the aforementioned Stewart, Imogen Poots, and Anton Yelchin? (Many people act like he was a Hollywood dynamo since his passing, like they always do). Deaths of key characters that had far less innovation than the remake of Cabin Fever, which has Meta and User score ratings of 14 and 3.7 (even though it was more entertaining to watch). A villain (and actor, most likely; I can't imagine this role was made his for anything other than a favour to a friend. If not, then boy did he need to remain in X-Men) that excludes blandness. The neo-Nazi angle was interchangeable. Rewrite the setting as a club and the antagonists as drug dealers then not only would the back story and culture of the group be just as non- fleshed out and unexplored, it probably would have been better to watch. Nothing else is worth mentioning as the movie is just that common and mediocre. We've seen this done better numerous times before in films like Red State, a decent movie that actually incorporated the identity of the antagonists, yet that movie is sitting at a Meta and User score of 50 and 6.2. Me caring too much is what I've been told, but as a passionate film fan, I'm meant to care. I hate seeing movies receive recognition they don't deserve. I'll use The Wolf of Wall Street as an example. Is it not obvious to every watcher of movies and their mother why that film received great acclaim despite being more on the crappy side? Everybody knows why that film and others like it are successful. But what one reason is there for Green Room to receive the scores it has? Truly, I have never been more perplexed.This whole review could have been avoided had this movie slotted into the 40 max and 4.5 max Metacritic and User score category it deserved. Or, perhaps I'm just over-analyzing it. Maybe critics were paid off and a high-percentage of raters really did rate this movie after Anton Yelchin died. I have no f'ing idea. Anyone with a clue, please contact me. This is a genuine mind****."
" I obviously didn't get it :/
",0.2584,0.9898,2017-01-20 00:00:00,6,"I've seen pretty much every type of horror movie, meaning I've seen every different type of monster (or mutant=-redneck) stalk pretty much every clich√© of teenager across every different type of landscape. It's fair to say that after ‚Äì roughly ‚Äì fifty years since the (original) 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' popularised the 'slasher' genre, there isn't really anything new to expect. The best you can hope for is an enjoyable rehash of something you've already seen that brings a sliver of something new to the table.I looked at the reviews for 'Green Room' and was pleasantly optimistic as it's rated very highly on many websites. I've always been a massive fan of Patrick Stewart and Ashton Yelchen usually turns in a decent performance (still say he was the best part of 'Terminator: Salvation') so, even if it wasn't that original, I was expecting something pretty entertaining. However, I've left it a couple of weeks to write this review and I'm finding it pretty hard to actually remember much of what happened ‚Äì in short, I found it pretty forgettable! It's about a young, up and coming band who ‚Äì as hard as it is to believe in this day and age ‚Äì doesn't use social media to promote themselves. Therefore, they're pretty much unknown, touring up and down America in pretty low-key venues. But, they think their luck is about to change when a contact offers them a gig where they can headline (and earn a bit of decent money in the process). Unfortunately, and this is a lesson to us all, the gig is in front of a group of white-supremacists who are hardly people you want to entertain. But, they almost get away with it if it wasn't for the fact that they witness a murder and their (not particularly adoring) crowd isn't too happy to just let them walk away as witnesses. Therefore, the band are forced to lock themselves backstage in (you may have guessed it) the green room and try and figure a way of escaping before they just get 'disappeared' long before they ever get the chance to win their first Grammy.Basically, it's a 'siege movie' (think 'Assault on Precinct 13' or something like that) with 'band vs Nazis.' It's an acceptable enough premise, but it's, as I've already mentioned, kind of forgettable. The band are just not that likable (or even memorable!). Without wishing to spoil things too much, one dies and it took me a while to even notice! I must have just blinked and they just vanished. They really were pretty forgettable. Obviously, the extreme ring-wingers were naturally nasty so you'd probably be a bit strange to root for them over the band, but it wasn't as violent as some of the reviews had made out. Yes, it is pretty dark and hardly a 'feel good' movie, but I was expecting even more heads to roll than were on offer! It wasn't' a bad film. It was just nothing I hadn't already seen before. Patrick Stewart is the head bad-guy and he's ‚Äì naturally ‚Äì always worth a watch, but, in my opinion, this wasn't the greatest swansong for poor old Ashton Yelchen. If you haven't seen that many siege movies, or are a major fan of any of the leads, you may find this quite good (or shocking!). However, if you're a grizzled veteran to the genre then there's little here you haven't seen before. I've pretty much already forgotten most of it (but then again with my age I could just be getting senile!)."

To briefly and vaguely summarize, these kids in a band get a gig and accidentally get themselves in a situation they have no idea how to handle.I have seen this movie called horror, which I suppose it is, but not in the context of what is normally considered horror. If you are looking for slasher/ghost story/monster type of horror, this is not that type. It's horror in a more real life situation context. I don't want to give anything away. If you are like me, I like to know the least amount of information as possible because I like the element of surprise. Let's just say that there is blood, gore and an excellent story to go along with it. It is very well written, directed, acted, and it was refreshingly original. It kept me on the edge of my seat and it was a bit scary at times. I highly recommend this movie. It is currently streaming on Amazon (if you have Prime, there is no addt'l charge to watch).

Though the film surprises us when their music actually goes down pretty well. And then things go wrong. There is some good one room tension in the next act of the film - it works great but beyond that this film will appeal if you really, really don't like punk bands or really, really like to see young people chewed up by vicious animals.

Being trapped like fish in a barrel by callous, murderous neo-Nazis? That's legitimately terrifying. Jeremy Saulnier's third feature film doesn't fall under the standard Hollywood definition of horror, (or thriller, or crime drama), but it's gory and will make your insides sweat with anxiety. Worst of all ‚Äì the premise is frighteningly plausible. ""Green Room"" follows a punk rock band that's spent every penny between them on their current road trip to the point that they're siphoning gasoline just to get to the next gig. When a show falls through, however, Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Alia Shawkat), Reece (Joe Cole), and Tiger (Callum Turner) reluctantly accept a hookup to play at a remote skinhead bar, which will provide them with enough cash to get home. Just as they're about to leave, however, they witness a murder and things start to head south.The seemingly mundane decision that leads to their captivity will undoubtedly be one of those movie moments that causes you to shout at the screen to stop it from happening every single time you watch this movie ‚Äì if you're brazen enough to subject yourself to it multiple times. That's another reason ""Green Room"" is so scary: the razor- thin line between life as usual and horrible trauma.A cinematographer first, Saulnier is one of those filmmakers who can take a low-budget story that would otherwise be mundane and elevate it with excellent craftsmanship. The darkness levels, the shot framing, the approach to violence and gore ‚Äì ""Green Room"" could have been a campy horror endeavor, but Saulnier never allows the film to lose its grip on reality. Even when he pushes boundaries a little, the idea that all this could actually happen never dissipates.The toll this takes on the characters and the way we imagine ourselves in their hapless situation has a lot to do with that grounding. A key negotiation scene between Pat and the club owner, Darcy (Patrick Stewart, whose gravitas only makes the film scarier) in which tensions run high but blood has not yet been shed, works, not for the particular scenario or dialogue, but the way our brains reel in trying to process the best positive outcome despite knowing full well things will get worse for the band. The way Saulnier's script keeps the intentions of the skinheads vague, but does not veil them completely, muddies the line between good and evil long enough to draw out the suspense for maximum effectiveness.Narratively, there isn't much for Saulnier to work with given the premise. Instead, the real arc is how the main characters go from your average reckless punk rock ""kids"" to needing to do whatever it takes to survive, even if that means employing extreme violence/skills they have no experience with. The story sets up an intriguing experiment about the desire to escape vs. fight back in life-threatening situations and has something insights into the human instinct and capacity for violence.""Green Room"" gets confusing at times and the characters embody attitudes and decision-making traits more so than complete people with motivations other than ""not dying."" It's a step up from the way most horror movies treat their characters, but not all that different. The difference lies in the craftsmanship, the stories foreboding and realistic premise and that gore, to Saulnier, is a means (and necessary consequence) of exploring the psyche. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

" Tense but unexciting and predictable
",-0.1779,-0.6371,2017-01-06 00:00:00,4,"So little happens during the entire duration of 'Green Room' that it relies on individual moments of violence and gore to be entertaining. The film is tense, but never really reaches a level where it becomes exciting or unpredictable.Instead, 'Green Room' is rather bland and the plot goes exactly where I was expecting it to. For this type of film, it's also unexpectedly uneventful. There aren't any real twists, the characters aren't interesting enough. This is a film you watch but don't really care much for what happens to the characters.All in all, not my sort of film. Perhaps I went in with unrealistic expectations, but I was let down by what this 'horror' had to offer."
" Dope
",0.0,0.8182,2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"This film is dripping with atmosphere, the cinematography is superb and the characters are realistic and grounded considering the fact the film centers on a punk band and neo Nazis it would be very easy for the writing to fulfill the stereotype that would no doubt be attached to such easily identifiable sub groups.This movie is fresh as daises, the characters are all believable and their reactions and the actions are all well fitting into the real world. The cat a mouse between Patrick steward and the performs is so tense and exciting I was chomping at the bit.Patrick Steward is the head of the neo Nazi club who is brutal and efficient and clearly enjoys his role, but he does not steal the lime light from the young leads as there acting chops shine just as bright.If you want to see a well paced alternative Horror film this is defiantly the one for you."
" What's your 'desert-island' band?
",0.0,-0.9922,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Saulnier's Blue Ruin was a shotgun blast to the chest of intense thrills from an unknown director. I had no idea what to expect from Blue Ruin, but when it was over my wife simply turned to me and said, ""That was intense"". So I was excited to see his next film get some big name recognition on board. The late Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots, Alia Shaukat and Picard himself, Patrick Stewart showcase their talents in this nail bitter of a follow-up.A down on their luck punk rock band take a gig at a neo-nazi club. Reluctant at first, but in desperate need for cash, they accept and play a decent gig. Just as they are about to leave, they see a dead body in the green room and bad decision are made after that. Now it's skinheads versus the punk rockers for survival. Green Room is not for the faint of heart, I'm a horror lover and I found myself cringing every so often at the shock and awe that Saulnier throws at the screen. He's not afraid to get things going fast and when he does, he turns Green Room up to eleven. I found myself asking, how are they going to get out of this? Multiple times even. Each time an attempt was made to leave, something terrible happens and Saulnier is not one for cheap gore tricks. He is restrained and holds back until you least expect it. Then the terror unleashes on the screen and it's too late to look away. Blue Ruin was about suspense, this is about terror. Locked up in one location, Green Room is a no holds barred 'us versus them' flick that surprises the viewer at a few turns. Most of the cast serve their purpose of being terrified for their lives and having to fight when needed. It's Stewart, known for his roles as courageous and commanding men (Picard, Professor X) that turns in a subtle and low-key performance. The man is the leader of skinheads and has the opportunity to unleash terror, but he holds back and almost has adds a fatherly figure to it. He mentors these young men so full of hate and he has to immediately take control of an out of control situation. Something about the calmness he has makes it even more terrifying. Men like this exist in the world."
