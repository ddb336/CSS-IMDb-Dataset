" Jenny Slate is dynamite
",0.1779,0.7841,2020-10-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie started my Jenny slate addiction. This is the role she will always be known for. As a 20-something woman, this film hits all the notes (and feels) about such a sensitive topic. Absolutely loved this film. I laughed, I cried, and I am now Jenny slates biggest fan."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,0.8531,2020-09-09 00:00:00,1,"Can't think of another movie that glorifies abortion to this extent
Mother and BFF of the protagonist are like ""hey , you're pregnant you should have an abortion""
It's scary that people are actually supportive to kind of behaviour"
" A ""feel good"" film in every way possible!
",0.4926,0.9887,2020-09-04 00:00:00,10,"The plot excels at creating a storyline centered around Donna Stearn (Jenny Slate) who--like every woman--is just trying to live their best life on their terms. With the realization that she is pregnant, after one wild night with a random, but very kind, stranger (Jake Lacy), Donna seeks comfort from her friends and mother about what to do. Instead of shaming her or making her feel wrong for deciding to get an abortion, the film normalizes her decision, with the support of everyone around her.The wonderful and heartwarming performance by Slate and Lacy is what makes this film far beyond the overdone, accidental pregnancy storyline. Instead, it creates a realistic depiction of a modern day woman who can find love at her own pace, and who realizes that she is enough."
" An important film encapsulating the life of a modern woman
",0.2023,0.8328,2020-06-29 00:00:00,9,"This film turns a classic trope on its head.Too many times have we seen in Cinema the concept of a young woman faced with an unfortunate and unexpected pregnancy. Juno, Saved, the list goes on. The issue is that in those films, the leading lady 'sees the light' and looks into adoption, works through issues with her boyfriend or family or this or that and decides that she can care for the baby and carry the pregnancy to full term.This is more often than not completely unfeasible when it comes to a woman faced with unexpected pregnancy. That's why this film is so great, it shows terminating a pregnancy to be simple and reasonable, not a decision to be ashamed of or one that is weighed down with guilt.The modern woman has options! Outdated Christian morals concerning abortion should not seep into the arts.1/3 women will have an abortion in their lives, let's make that more accepted in arts and the media. This film effortlessly portrays life realistically"
" A Positive Movie Surrounding Abortion
",0.5574,0.7755,2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,There aren't enough movies that show the positivity of such a painful subject. This movie made me laugh out loud more than once. I loved the matter-of-fact way the subject was introduced and the follow through within the movie. It felt real without being preachy. I can't say enough good things about this movie.
" Touchingly Raunchy
",0.0,0.5584,2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"A cute movie about a touchy subject: abortion. It masterfully balances sentimentality and raunchy humor. The story, however, is very lean, possibly too lean. The second act feels underdeveloped, and the father-daughter relationship completely disappears. A refreshing addition to the rom-com genre."
" 6.8, really!?
",0.0,-0.878,2019-11-03 00:00:00,2,"This is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I didn't laugh once. It was basically one big, long raunchy joke without a punchline. What was funny in this except for how bad it was?The whole movie is about this girl who's apparently a comedian, who has two best friends who suck, horribly; an ex who cheats on her, and a one night stand that ensues.She gets pregnant from said one night stand, on no, who saw that coming! And decides to get abortion. It doesn't go the route of the typical romcom. I expected the guy to stop her and they'd agree to keep the kid but nope. She gets the abortion and it ends with them holding hands on the couch as they're apparently together now...So she gets pregnant by stranger, struggles with shame over the idea of getting an abortion, gets one, then starts dating said stranger.2/10"
" So good, so accurate
",0.4927,0.9857,2019-06-18 00:00:00,10,"Jenny Slate is a beast...she can kill an emotional cry fest, a diarrhea joke, a moment of pure joy with gusto. She perfectly depicts the inner struggle that comes (even when you know you're making the right choice). Hoffman also does an amazing job, with perfectly calm acting - no overreacting on her part, ever. Every woman should have a friend like her character...calm, real, strong and fierce. The parental relationships are interesting and dynamic. This movie is very wonderful and an underrated comedy, with an incredible touch to it. Highly recommend!"
" 10 for courage!
",0.5411,0.5574,2019-05-03 00:00:00,10,"Spoiler
Well done comedy with a real plot, nearly 1 in 5 women have had an abortion by age 30. Thank you for bringing light to this subject in such a difficult part of many women's reality."
" Obvious Coming of Age
",0.0,0.8779,2019-04-02 00:00:00,7,"'OC,' was a great heartwarming film. The realism in the bits and dialogue felt very fluid. There was not a single time I felt the cringe bug. Makes you think. In a good, happy-emoting way."
" Awkward and adorable
",0.3818,0.9312,2019-02-18 00:00:00,8,This is a really fun and quirky romance for someone that wants something new and real. The chemistry is fantastic and brings genuine smiles to your face.
" A mirror on modern society
",0.0,0.9458,2019-02-17 00:00:00,8,"It made me laugh. Big time, on several occasions. The main character was more than 3 dimensional: she was fully real: I felt I got a new acquaintance.The movie is about nothing -much like the life of many 20-something privileged ones-. And it shows this heavy-light nothing with humor, style and eventually a somewhat dark look at the reality of abortions.It might make you angry and you'll judge the movie and the main character. Yet, it's everyday reality you are looking at. (You'd be probably surprised to know how many people have how many abortions.)We have a 14 month old, beautiful child. Before he was born we were sure that the right to abortion is a great thing.
Now we aren't so sure any more.
Yet, who am to judge anyone, including a fun, late 20s, bit lost in life girl?""Now that I have one I can talk about abortion."" I guess as a male I'll always be excluded from this conversation: and probably for the better."
" The ""shocking"" truth about a woman's right to choose
",0.3182,0.8134,2018-11-13 00:00:00,9,"I'm not surprised to see the reviews claiming this movie ""glorifies"" abortions. I know it might be hard to watch a story that accepts the decision of a character to have an abortion without showing that character in turmoil over the decision or experiencing regret over the decision- but that is accurate for some women. This is why people are Pro-choice (not Pro-Abortion) because each woman knows whether she can personally live with the decision. Really. We know. Just as there are some women that couldn't imagine having an abortion, there are those that have abortions and (gasp) don't feel guilty about it.
I thought this movie was funny and the character of Donna was one we rarely see. A female character that is still struggling at the ripe age of 28 (I guess only male leads can be post-college age and still trying to figure out life and love?). A female character that is still learning to love herself. A female character that has center stage. It is only fitting that the movie ends with the main character watching Gone with the Wind for the first time while recovering on the couch.
Tomorrow is another day."
" Do the right thing in extreme situation!
",0.0,0.7665,2018-08-24 00:00:00,8,"What one likes? It is to follow his ideals everywhere in whatever circumstances are introduced to world known to him. To follow the rules which do not keep him away from pleasures of life, neither put him into any trouble.There are certain situations that occur, certain mistakes that happen. What one must do in such situations is called as right thing to do even if it appears unethical. This is why critics have appreciated the movie so much. Darkness can be ended with light and not more darkness.Just keep in mind even if you are different, there will be situations available that fulfill your destiny."
" Liked it until the ending
",0.4215,0.988,2018-08-19 00:00:00,2,"Spoiler alert.I got a few laughs from this movie. I recently faced an unplanned pregnancy. I did not make the same choice as Donna.When Max turns out to be such a good guy, I was sure it could not end in Donna going through with the abortion. I thought, she is at a good age (same age as me), mature enough to go through with the pregnancy - besides, Max was a total dream. In the end, as another reviewer says, it glamorizes abortion. Max and Donna end up together! They're all cozy spending 10 hours watching Gone with the Wind on the couch after the abortion. It is implied they might stay together and have kids down the road. Donna's mother really liked Max, who it turns out is her student. Donna read the signs, but she still aborted what would have been a beautiful and bright child. Donna and Max want to prolong their own childhood, postpone having to grow up and raise a child themselves. They have better things to do like tell fart jokes and get ridiculously drunk.It is suggesting to women to give into pressure for abortion - that dream guy who knocked you up will reward you for it and give you babies later when it's more convenient! Have an abortion now, and he'll stick by you later!Human life shouldn't be something to just do away with because the timing isn't right or however we try to justify it. Does she ever ask him, or he ever ask her, how they would feel about keeping it? No, they don't even consider it. You see the hope in her, the expectation that he might tell her to keep it. She goes through with the abortion though she clearly feels uncomfortable with it. Or who knows, maybe the movie is commentary on how women do as society expects them to - like just abort because you don't know the guy well enough. And how men don't stand up and say, you don't need to kill that baby, I will support you in having it. He never said that. A lot of men these days feel entitled to abortions and women seem to get them if a pregnancy doesn't fit within their preconceived notions about their live path. But, I doubt it. That last scene, where they're all happy together after the abortion, really pissed me off. They never had a thought for the child they killed. Felt like I wasted my time watching this movie. Pro abortion propoganda."
" Disgusting
",-0.5267,0.7297,2018-07-29 00:00:00,1,Wish I could vote 0 stars. This has to be the worst movie ever. It needs to be clear this is a movie about abortion. I sat here watching hoping she would change her mind and take responsibility for her actions and NOT abort her baby. Nope she ends up doing it anyway. The entire movie comments are thrown left and right making it seem like abortions are normal. In the end she does a stand up comedy show making JOKES about how she's about to have an abortion like it isnt actually a baby. This movie was crazy depressing. Never will I watch anything with any of these actors again. Definitely made me dislike them all for supporting this trash of a story line. Worst. Movie. Ever.
" I loved it.
",0.5994,0.8261,2018-07-26 00:00:00,10,Perfection. From the minute I started watching this film I was locked in. Fully attentive. Beautifully written and acted out. 10/10.
" Amazing movie
",0.5859,0.9464,2018-07-23 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie. It's bittersweet, heartfelt, hilarious in it's saddest moments, and comes off as a genuine representation of reproductive autonomy. I love that there isn't any judging, that Donna is a nice person who loves to make people laugh and knows what is best for her. I can't spoil anything, but it's a nice film. It stayed with me for a long time."
" a beautiful innocent girl
",0.743,0.9632,2018-03-02 00:00:00,10,"The story is about a beautiful innocent girl would you with her problems with her own way.of course she's the obvious child but in this childish behaviour, you see a lot more than that.they say going through life in that make you strong, maybe they're right, because after that incident you can see how she changes.the way she tried to make things right is so interesting to me and I can't get enough of it.I love this movie and I will watch it every time I feel blue and it makes me feel better"
" Pointless movie, but I liked it enough
",0.5719,0.9759,2017-07-20 00:00:00,6,"Jenny Slate is adorable. Usually I dislike small-time comedians, especially the ones who just go on about their genitals and complaining about their life in that twee-awkward way, but she pulls it off well enough. Also, the dialogue is witty and engaging most of the time.But other than that, the movie does not have much going for it. Indeed, the approach to abortion is controversial, other reviewers have that covered. I want to highlight that the way the main character Donna treats the love interest, Max, is absolutely deplorable. And he hardly bats an eyelash about it. The way the movie handles the central conflict and winds down is incredibly lazy writing and jarringly unrealistic. The movie has little in the way of a plot arc or character development, then it suddenly ends.Also, lots of other charming actors populate the line-up, like Gaby Hoffman and David Cross. They kept the movie watchable and worthwhile."
" Passable fun
",0.5106,0.8026,2017-02-08 00:00:00,5,"Although it dwells into serious topics, the characters are likable but one-note, the jokes are unfunny and sometimes immature and the message comes along preachy (yeah, suddenly everyone has had an abortion). Despite all these flaws, it was enjoyable enough. Jenny Slate brings a sort of vulnerability, but unfortunately the characterisation itself was lacking for the audience to really connect with her struggles. The running time is short, but it feels like certain scenes were unnecessary (like the one with David Cross). In the end, despite the film being well-intentioned and pretty to look at, there wasn't too much story to be told in the first place."
" I'll take three more sips...
",0.0,0.8641,2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I saw a clip of Jenny Slate's Donna waiting outside her ex's doorstep and I was intrigued enough to check out this movie because of it. The scene pretty much perfectly encapsulates how we grieve and incorporate bargaining into the process - she's sniffing and shivering in the morning frost, clutching a coffee and making nonsensical bets so that she can convince herself to stay a little longer and catch a glimpse of him. What Slate does with her laugh in this movie is actually fascinating; she channels it as an almost sub-conscious defense mechanism, descending into prolonged giggles every time her emotions surface and begin to overwhelm her. Here she alternates it between sobs and pathetic justifications for trying to bump into her ex, and it's so beautifully genuine because we've all done this, whether it was for smaller or bigger decisions. It's not rational, but that's what makes it real, and it often reveals our true feelings. The other reactions of Donna post-breakup are more disappointing because we have also seen them many times, but only in movies. The typical montage of drunken, angry phone calls, jump cuts to trim the fat but keep the one-liners, alternating between being cordial and being that psycho ex. She predictably bombs at her next show, moaning about how her world has ended, and then quickly jumps into another montage and into bed with Max from the bar. That instant spark, their loud, electric connection (they play drums as foreplay) then quickly dissipates as she sneaks out the next morning without a word. It was at this moment where I was beginning to feel embarrassed for her rather than sympathetic. Slate plays Donna as a new age, foul-mouthed, liberated woman. It's 2014, of course, and there is no longer anyone chastising her for not being a lady - and if there was, she'd flip them off. But she also uses the same tactic when her parents try to coax a little ambition out of her; she's on the wrong side of twenty five, and just got fired from a bookstore. At times Donna feels like a mumblecore caricature long past her expiration date, with a dash of millennial (when she is dumped he stares at his phone, right before she returns serve with two dozen missed calls). She's the type of person to spit a one-liner in the face of a difficult situation to hasten her quick getaway. She replies to almost everything, even serious offers of assistance, with the same brand of irony and snarky cynicism - even her inner monologue has an attitude. I was half expecting the reveal of her pregnancy to be accompanied by the opening bars of Beethoven's 5th. There's even a convenient placing of dog poop to let her off the hook from answering a hard question from Max. And yet she is humbled at times, and Slate is able to lead her persona away from that irreverent, 'unapologetically herself' young adult and into meaningful territory. Donna may seem like the person to storm into a clinic and point to 'abortion' as if it was on the menu of a cheap restaurant, but she resists this approach because of her inherent empathy. In this particular situation, she doesn't place much importance on the procedure, but the movie also respects others who do. Robespierre is fighting the tide against movies where abortion is never a path to joy. Either it is an unavoidable consequence borne out of difficult circumstances until the last moment where a sprig of inspiration leads to her keeping the baby, or she goes through the procedure and is left a mere shell. Come to think of it, I can't remember a movie where a woman has an abortion but still gets through to the happy ending without any further hitches. The act itself is nestled into the final act, not as an afterthought, but merely something that has to be done. There's no playing around with the will she/won't she moralising that other portrayals usually get bogged down in. Given the often dirtied reputation that abortion is saddled with, the movie does well to untangle the issue from layers of stigmatisation. It has been dubbed an 'abortion comedy' - two words making an unlikely combination that will immediately turn some viewers away. But more than just abortion it is about growing up. Donna grows by not pushing away a new stranger in her life for once. Max is practically perfect, waltzing up with roses, accompanying her to the clinic and giving her more than one chance, and it seems that this good a person shouldn't really exist for Donna. But I choose not to be cynical, and believe that it isn't an issue of whether or not she deserves it, but whether she recognises it."
" The kind of rom com there should be more of
",0.0,0.9365,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"After it came out at Sundance Obvious Child was labelled an abortion rom com, which it sort of is, but I understand might put some people off. What the movie gets right is by never really treating the abortion part of the movie as a joke, but according it the weight it deserves. To rewind a bit: what the movie is actually about is Donna (Jenny Slate), a struggling comic who finds out she's just been dumped by her boyfriend who has left her for one of her friends. It's a hard pill to swallow and Donna doesn't take it well, melting down in spectacular fashion both in private and on stage during a set. To rebound she meets up with Max, who just misses one of her disastrous sets but quickly falls for Donna thanks to her cute looks and absolute wit. They sleep together, which Donna thinks is a one night stand and Max thinks is something more, and the majority of the film watches them navigate this space, as Donna slowly comes to realize that Max might be someone she could actually fall for at the same time as she keep secret the fact that she is also pregnant. This is a star making performance from Jenny Slate who handles both the comedic and tragic aspects of her character perfectly. Jake Lacy is MADE to be a modern day romantic lead. He's the perfect blend of gentleman and shy boy and the way he sets out to capture Donna's heart is the kind of sweetness that only exists in the movies."
