" A partly charming romance with nice leads
",0.8634,0.9949,2021-04-11 00:00:00,6,"Okay, this is a very watchable film, no doubt, but I wish it was a little less messy and focused more on the story of the two leading stars without too much detail into the proceedings within the family. The film is still quite colourful and I'm glad the big production houses stopped the pathetic tentdency to make films which reek of Western influence. Finally there are films based in India and celebrating the beauty of Indian culture. The film is very colourful, the songs are nice, and although the love story is not entirely convincing, the two leads make it worth a watch. Parineeti was very good in previous films where she played the sassy young lass. Here she plays an awkward sort of scientist and although she knows her lines well, something is missing and she doesn't totally get the jerky nature of the part. She is still pretty good and pretty in general so it's nice to watch her. Sidharth Malhotra is a good leading man - he has charisma and a pleasant presence and acting-wise he performs naturally throughout. Together these two leads make the film even more watchable than it would have been, so if you're into this kind of romantic films, go watch it."
" Superbly crafted,Smartly written,well acted and a super fantastic film...

The duo if senti Siddharth and mental parineeti rocks in the whole movie,and has delievered all the emotions much effortlessly. Parineeti Chopra has given her career best performance. HTP is a powerful film packed with an outstanding cinematography. If you're planning to watch coolie no. 1 on prime then drop the idea and book your shows with HTP on prime.
After tamasha and lootera this is the third romantic film that has so much deep impact on me.Another attraction if the movie is Millennial and melodius music that will stay in your playlists forever.."

" Spend fun time
",0.5106,0.9499,2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,Finally a Parineety did quite great somewhere. Siddharth was really good as usual. Simply beautiful and funny movie but the ending could be more better. Musics were good too. Watch it.

" Not Recommended üëé
",-0.1511,0.0,2020-07-09 00:00:00,1,"The same old ""lovestory"" with a slightly tilted angle -_-"
" poor directing
",-0.4767,0.674,2020-03-23 00:00:00,2,Though i get what style this film was going for but the director lost sight of the theme. Though I get the rules he was trying to break...he wasn't consistently breaking them. Also the whole manic pixie dream character was so irritating and poorly directed. She had no real depth to her character and every time she bit her lip to display her quirkyness or whatever I straight up wanted to punch her in the face. I can't believe how annoying her character was and straight up not believable but a caricature. This seems like a big budget film so frikin do better.

" Parineeti Rocks in this wonderful film
",0.657,0.9442,2020-01-18 00:00:00,10,Have watched this movie multiple times in theatres and on television. It just never gets old. Parineeti is spectacular in the movie. Sidharth Malhotra is fabulous as well. Supporting cast is incredible as well in their respective roles. Music compliments the scenes so well.
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9732,2019-04-07 00:00:00,10,"Great story, great performances, great movie surely one of the best movie.... Deserves lot more appreciations"
" Definitely recommend!
",0.6696,0.9708,2018-09-17 00:00:00,10,A really cute movie that has a nice twist from the ordinary Bollywood movie! I enjoyed the movie a lot and watched it many times. I would definitely recommend it if your looking for a cute romantic comedy to watch!
" Okay...
",0.0,0.8956,2018-04-11 00:00:00,5,Maybe the most misleading title of all time!Not your average romantic comedy. This movie has something serious on it's mind yet remaining swift and entertaining throughout. Siddharth Kapoor is amazing in the movie.But there are some missteps.I was unable buy Parineeti Chopra's character at all. The ending is disappointingly clich√©d. The musical numbers are roadblocks. The music score is patronizingly used. Not all of the humor works.A good movie to pass your time though.
