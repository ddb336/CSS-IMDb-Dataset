" This is funny as hell.
",-0.4019,0.9531,2021-03-11 00:00:00,10,Very few movies actually are timeless political comedy and this is one of them. It's easy to think it has personal agendas but it's hilarious and beautiful in it's own way. The whole silly and emotional moments are all treat to watch.
" Hilarious
",0.4019,0.9441,2021-03-04 00:00:00,9,This is a great movie that i highly recommended watching. It contains a bunch of hilarious political satire and outlandish comedy mixed in with some plot points that add drama and romance making this a well balanced movie.
" So much better than I was expecting!
",0.5378,0.998,2021-02-28 00:00:00,7,"I expected The Interview to be very cringe and awkward, but it totally surprised me in that it was funny and entertaining from start to finish!Fans of Evan and Seth's work know what to expect from one of their films. They are crass, stupid, with gross out humour and ridiculous characters, which is what makes them so glorious. The Interview has everything you could want and expect. It had me laughing out loud a good few times, and had two really funny characters at its centre.Speaking of the characters, the chemistry between Seth and James is so great. You can tell they have a great time making movies together, and this comes across on screen. James Franco completely steals the show and is easily the funniest thing about the film. His comedic timing, facial expressions, mannerisms were all spot on.The script and plot were absolutely bizarre and ridiculous, which I loved. It had a great pace, and never threatened to take itself too seriously. They knew what they were doing was so out there and were very happy to lean into that in glorious fashion.A fantastic surprise and a thoroughly entertaining film!"
" Lighten up people!!
",0.0,0.9618,2021-02-12 00:00:00,7,Not the best comedy but very enjoyable. Seth and James play off each other well with Seth being more of the straight guy. The acting is good and the plot is interesting for what it is....a comedy!!!!
" Lots of fun
",0.5106,0.9231,2021-01-13 00:00:00,7,"Feels like a stoner movie. Some great moments and hilarious lines of dialogue. All the actors are at their best, with comedy ranging from crude jokes to political satire."
" i wanted to find it funny
",0.4404,0.6593,2020-12-11 00:00:00,4,It's not a BAD film per say. They just over-did it with everything. It was unfunny and loud. Just finished watching it high too and found it pretty unamusing. I usually enjoy movies with Seth and James but this didn't do it for me.
" Hilarious!
",0.4574,0.8114,2020-11-23 00:00:00,9,Extremely funny from start to finish! One of the funniest movies I've ever seen!
" Chef's Kiss
",0.4215,-0.6705,2020-10-25 00:00:00,9,"Laughed my brains out! If you didn't laugh or think that Seth Rogan and James Franco are absolute LEGENDS in this movie, you're a prude so humble yourself. Also, why hate on a movie THAT ACTUALLY PRIORITIZES SAVING THE DOG!!"
" I might sound crazy but........I love this movie
",0.4215,0.877,2020-10-01 00:00:00,10,I think this is it under rated a comedy that I think this is a underrated comedy that may sound controversial but still I love this movie!!!!
" Decent movie
",0.0,0.714,2020-09-24 00:00:00,4,Pretty slow movie in the beginning and nothing much going on but a good finish to the movie
" Hilarious, top drawer, fun distraction!
",0.6696,0.9852,2020-08-29 00:00:00,10,"I laughed aloud throughout and realized during ad breaks how glad I was that I had found it on the TV lineup. Franco is really talented ..great comedic timing and so cute! Rogen is funny and charming and innocently sexy, and Randall is darned good looking...
believable as Korean bad guy, but way more handsome. The story is funny and well played out. I first saw this in the theater, really liked it and would watch it again. It's going to be a crowd pleaser for many generations. Just a classic comedy..nothing negative about it!"
" Americans trying to make comedy
",0.3612,0.743,2020-08-12 00:00:00,5,"Clearly some scenes that the script writers thought would be funny make the movie just dumb...
It could have been a great story with good jokes... But nopeWaste of time..."
" Worst movie ever?
",-0.6249,-0.5423,2020-08-12 00:00:00,1,My pick for worst movie ever. Some movies are bad but fun to watch because they are bad. This was just painful to watch. Sony released this on line for free and still I felt I over paid.
" These type of films are past their shelf date
",0.0,0.4323,2020-08-09 00:00:00,5,"I remember all the news around this film, how controversial it was. However once you watch it you see how pitiful and silly it really is. It also made me think of the shelf life of certain types of comedic films. The 80s and 90s gave us Adam Sandler, Chris Rock & also Rob Shneider who peaked in the 90s and early 2000s. The early 2000s then ushered in a new type of comedian with the likes of Seth Rogen, James Franco & Jonah Hill. They starred in over the top but different kind of films that were enjoyable. However whats happened to Adam Sandler's movies is starting to happen to Rogen and Franco. These silly and ridiculous plots with no sense aren't that original anymore. We've all seen a fair bit of them and the mindless fun and novelty has worn off. I am pleased I didn't spend money watching this in theater and saw it on Netflix instead."
" Embarassing propaganda ""comedy"" movie
",-0.25,-0.3897,2020-08-08 00:00:00,2,"This is a really bad US warmongering propaganda movie, labeled a ""comedy"" while not being funny one second. The action is horribly bad and James Franco can do so much better than this garbage. I fully understand North Korea wanting to spare mankind from having to suffer through this film. So, on behalf of all intelligent people, thank you North Korea for trying to stop this anti-intellectual b-movie garbage. The dialogues in the movie is cringe and mindless shouting. American Hollywood fans tend to like shouting and fart humour in their comedies, but not even american audiences seem to like this film."
" Ok latenight comedy
",0.5719,0.9423,2020-08-04 00:00:00,5,"It has some fun moments. Dumb latenight comedy, probably targeted for potheads. Good casting, everything else is ok at the best, still worth watching if you're up to some minor laughs."
" Great fun
",0.8126,0.7089,2020-07-15 00:00:00,9,This movie definitely deserves a higher rating. It's very nicely done
" Borrow bad acting
",-0.5423,-0.7841,2020-07-12 00:00:00,4,Redicilous movie. Bad acting. Very poor screenplay.
" Overall good movie
",0.4404,0.9834,2020-07-05 00:00:00,7,"If we look at the movie from a late night comedy perspective, it was perfect movie with a hint of action and a lot of jokes.
Halfway through the movie, it takes a different route, and becomes more unserious, which is fine.
The acting is great, though sometimes you would maybe think to yourself, ""Where is this going to go?"", but for the most parts it picks up again and gets even more hilarious.
I would've liked to see a more serious perspective sometimes in the movie, because it is in fact an action/comedy, and would've loved to see Seth Rogen in a more concentrated state sometimes.
But overall great movie, would recommend."
" rubbish
",0.0,-0.5106,2020-06-26 00:00:00,1,"Just watched this on TV, what a disappointment, absolute rubbish. 'Embarrassing' in parts & self indulgent."
" Dud
",-0.25,-0.5788,2020-06-26 00:00:00,3,"There were a few amusing moments, but the majority of the film was juvenile and annoying. Not worth the hype."
" refreshingly different
",0.0,-0.4981,2020-06-26 00:00:00,7,"The fact that NK tried to nobble this film only shows that dictatorships don't know when they're on to a good thing: it's actually fairer and more sympathetic to them than anybody could reasonably expect. It's funny too, with a command comic performance from James Franco, although it doesn't quite live up to the fun and games of the first half hour - in fact it's a little too long. The daftest (and saddest) part of a very daft and sad film, is the naïve belief that NK only needs to be 'shown the reality' to see reason and for us all to be friends. How is that working out for the American electorate and Trump? We'll see, but the only belief more foolish than thinking war achieves anything is thinking that reasoning with people achieves anything."
" It's a pretty fun one-time watch
",0.7579,0.939,2020-06-11 00:00:00,6,"Do not go in with sky high expectations, and you'll come out happier. This is a unique concept in the comedy genre and these guys did a good job (...almost). The movie has a lot of fun moments, but logic and common sense take a back seat - especially in the final few minutes, where you beg that those two come out of hiding and take things under control.The first half is meant to be fun, and it doesn't disappoint. I feel like they wasted the second half with crap dialogues and a string of unlikely events. Rogen and Franco are pretty good, but you'd wish the writers had trimmed out some of the obnoxious bits of Franco's character.To sum up, it's great for one (and only one) of those Thursday evenings to fuel you up for the weekend."
" Good comedy that people shouldn't take too seriously
",0.7112,0.9855,2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,"""The Interview"" was a fun movie. It starred James Franco and Seth Rogen, who played Dave Skylark and Aaron Rappaport, two guys that have their own talk show and decide to ask Kim Jong Un (Randall Park), who happens to be a big fan of the show for an interview. He accepts the offer and the CIA learn about this which leads to them tracking down Dave and Aaron and giving them the crazy task of killing Kim Jong Un.I liked the plot as it was really fun and entertaining. You'd think a movie about killing Kim Jong Un would be all serious but it wasn't. James Franco (Dave) and Seth Rogen (Aaron) were funny in this. Randall Park (Kim) was also funny as he actually made Kim Jong Un seem like a nice guy but obviously as the movie progresses we learn that he is not. I actually thought Dave died when Kim shot him and I loved how he jumped up revealing that he had a bulletproof vest. Nice callback to earlier on when he kept telling Agent Lacey how much he wanted one.Overall, I'll give ""The Interview"" an 8/10. Good movie with a lot of funny moments!"
" In spite of the controversial topic, its a bland film
",-0.6369,0.9153,2020-05-31 00:00:00,4,"The movie was surrounded by controversy when it released, and i'm pretty sure that controversy is why it even received attention in the first place. Having only watched it for the first time this year i can say it does not hold up.
Its an absurd movie, but in the bad way, the plot is dumb, the characters are shallow and the spirit to spread a genuinely important message is there its hidden too much behind corny jokes and cliche dialogue to really be an important part of the movie.
I will admit, there were a few jokes and scenes that genuinely cracked me up and its a fun movie to watch once, maybe twice if you're with friends, but other then that there's not much this movie has going for it."
" The Interview
",0.0,0.7682,2020-05-28 00:00:00,7,"While it doesn't fulfill the idea of a complete ""political satire"", and doesn't go as far on the jokes as I'd like it to, The Interview, is still a wild, far fetched, clever, over the top, and sometimes hilarious film, that has a great perfomance by James Franco, well enough writing to entertain, and after North Korea's reaction to the film, kind of depicts the pettiness of their "" supreme leader"". The film contains the usual for an R rated, as their are a ton of sex jokes, but it's crazy plot, and its ridiculous ending involving crying, a bulletproof vest, and seal team six, show this film is anything but to be taken a sliver seriously. It could have been better, and everything wasn't hit, but ""The Interview is still a satisfying experience."
" Sometimes funny, but mostly done before
",0.2382,0.9873,2020-05-15 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed much of the humor when it came to Kim Jung Un and his love of Katy Perry. The actor there did a great job of making Kim Jung Un kinda both adorable and psychopathic.Whether it was necessary though that they had to portray a real dictator is another matter. I personally feel like it was a smart, ballsy choice, that paid off in terms of the buzz it generated. But unfortunately, the overall end product was a pretty generic and pre-packaged ""Hangover"" style comedy in terms of plot, character, acting, dialogue, editing, and so forth.In terms of entertainment, there is certainly some, but the Korean actors who sound like they can't really speak Korean, and the characters who have the same word choices and speech patterns even though they live countries apart, and the casting of Seth Rogen who doesn't really have a new role to play, was just a lot of poor direction and casting.Still, has some moments of good humor, and higher potential than was ultimately realized by artistic, technical and popular standards."

" An average film remembered for controversy
",0.0,0.9628,2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,"The Interview was the film that nearly brought Sony Pictures to its knees because the filmmakers dared to make fun of Kim Jung-Un. If it weren't for this controversy The Interview would only be remembered as a minor comedy film.The film reteamed Seth Rogen and James Franco after This is the End. They play an entertainment interviewer and his producer who scores an interview with Kim Jung-Un and get recruited by the CIA to assassin the North Korean leader. Rogen worked with his regular partner, Evan Goldberg, and together they made a comedy that was grand in scale: it opened with a mission test and ends with a massive gun battle. The humour in the film was hit and miss with Franco being annoying as the interviewer and Rogen was the straight man. Some moments made me laugh or chuckles, another didn't cause a reaction. It's easy viewing."
" Entertaining for what it is
",0.4404,0.8778,2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"If you have low expectations going into this movie, you'll enjoy it a lot more. Yes, it is ridiculous, but it's also pretty funny and has some decent commentary on the world. It can be a little too over the top at times, but this is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and you shouldn't either."
" Great comedy
",0.765,0.9842,2020-04-24 00:00:00,8,The Interview is a great comedy that doesn't waste its excellent premise. Seth Rogen and James Franco are great with reliably fantastic chemistry. Randall Park and Diana Bang are really good. It's consistently funny despite a few jokes that aren't funny. It's well filmed and the direction by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg is also great. The soundtrack is really good and the music by Henry Jackman is good.

" Stupid and absurd, but quite enjoyable
",0.4748,0.9931,2020-03-24 00:00:00,9,"Completely absurd in all the right ways, The Interview does a pretty well job at making you laugh, even if the film as a whole does certainly have its flaws. The film is quite over the top, which if you know what it is about, you probably already know. However, some gags in the film seem more forced than others, making it all together less enjoyable than it seems it could be. At its worse, The Interview can seem like a lazy political comedy that relies on gross out humor to play its own game. At its best however, The Interview harnesses its potential, jokes, and all the talent involved, for one truly hilarious ride, which may be ridiculous, but is so in the best of ways. The pacing works quite well, with it always being entertaining throughout, despite some awkward moments. In the end, The Interview is far from a great comedy film, but is certainly worth a watch, and certainly earning of the laughs that it may try too hard to achieve.
My Rating: 8.5/10"
" Better Than Average Satire
",0.4404,0.0568,2020-03-23 00:00:00,6,"THis film falls under good try, but no cigar. THe satire was too broad at times and at other times, the film tries to be meaningful, but fails. There is no doubt that there are several laugh at loud segments, but they are overcome by several not so funny segments. Franco and the other guy (who is really not an actor) do a reasonable job in their roles, and the guy playing Kim is very good. The Korean female lead is a bit predictable, and not that convincing. the film is entertaining, particularly if you are familiar with Asia. But most audiences will just not get it."

The humour is silly, crass and a bit cringey at times being mostly laddish in nature, and the leads are very entertaining throughout the straightforward plot.

""Playing music is supposed to be fun. It's about heart, it's about feelings, moving people, and something beautiful, and it's not about notes on a page. I can teach you notes on a page, I can't teach you that other stuff.""

Reminded me of South Park with their take on a dictator. How do you make fun of them? Turn them into everything they hate.Of course this movie isn't Wag the Dog or some smart political commentary or satire movie because it was never intended to be. It's a comedy from Seth Rogan. That miserable SOB Kim Jon Un just turned it into that. As he should be offended since his country doesn't have freedom of speech and I'm sure he's never been criticized in his entire life. I only wish that they made fun of how fat that pathetic little man is, because that's such an easy target and beyond the hair adds to his goofy unthreatening, ungodly appearance. Really a missed opportunity, the fact that he says that he doesn't pee or poop and that he is a God and that he is really fat is too funny. you wonder if because he doesn't have to go to the bathroom that it's still inside of him and that's why he's such a fat piece of crap."

" Movie Review ""The Interview""
",0.0,0.9991,2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Movie Review ""The Interview""
The Interview directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, is an action-comedy film from Columbia Pictures studios starring James Franco as Dave Skylark and Seth Rogen as his producer Aaron Rapoport. Together, the two run a tabloid television show called ""Skylark Tonight"", where Skylark interviews celebrities. The two learn that Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader of North Korea, is a huge fan of the show and they want to set up an interview. The CIA has come to realization of this matter and they give orders to Skylark and Rapoport that the dictator must be taken out. Throughout the film Rogen and Franco find themselves in peculiar situations and the way they react to them causes the comedic outcomes that makes the film an overall great and action packed comedy.This film shines a light on serious-comedic acting, Rogen, Franco, and other actors throughout the film act as if they're actually in serious business related situations, but the outstanding acting results in the humorous outcomes and reactions. This film does a great job of making dirty and strange jokes so if you don't find those humorous, this wouldn't be the film for you. Randall Park stars as supreme leader Kim Jong Un, his acting plays a key part in the film through his double edged role as the antagonist, through one half of the film. He is seen as nice and respectable at first but as the film progresses he must change personalities towards Skylark and Rapoport, I feel that his acting is very well done and it reflects through how the film turned out. The overall acting in this action-comedy film is the reason why it should receive credit, Franco and Rogen do a well done job overall as the main characters and they show why they remain to be some of the best comedy based actors in film history.
The plot flows nicely through the movie and has a very good ending message but overall I think the most influential part of the film is that the plot interweaves between rags to riches, and overcoming a challenge that the protagonist must face either by an antagonist or situation. The way the plot revolves around them trying to assassinate Kim Jong Un obviously creates this challenge, that is given to them to complete. Along with this challenge comes the emotional pain and obstacles that actors must face throughout the film, together it all creates a suspense in the plot that has viewers wanting to know what happens next. The interesting acts and events that take place throughout this film entail how random but funny this comedy is. The action packed scenes along with the numerous amount of jokes and funny nature even out the seriousness and business part of the film. Although the plot does flow smoothly and has good dialogue and reference, this film at times can seem to be too much or a little on edge with the jokes. The film is for the most place shot in the setting of North Korea and it leads with tiny amounts of false information, but this detail is the reason why the film is so fun to watch and why it relishes in comedy.Overall this film has great value in its own way and the acting and directing deserves a ten out of ten. Franco and Rogen do a good job of creating a duo that dynamically stick with each other through the whole movie. This movie does a great job with creating suspense and it brings a sense of raw emotion that is seen through the well done acting."
" The First Comedy In A While That Made Me Laugh!
",0.75,0.9452,2020-01-01 00:00:00,8,"First off, I will start by saying I usually don't watch comedies because I never laugh at them. This movie however had me laughing the most I have been at a comedy in at least half a year. The movie starts off very comedic-ally centered, but in the second and third act it becomes much more of a action movie. Which I actually enjoy. I look at this movie as a movie, not as any of the controversy surrounding it.Seth Rogen and James Franco are brilliant in this film, and the movie pokes fun at both North Korea and the USA. The movie tries to make the audience realize the type of news and media they are consuming."

It is we who underestimate him as a bad person.That said, let's get back to reality. And useless, Seth Rogen and James Franco are the new gods of 21st century American comedy.

There is a fair share of scenes that had me laughing out loud, but I could not overlook the ridiculousness of the plot. My lasting thought throughout the film was that these same jokes would have been just as funny in a less outrageous story.
James Franco and Seth Rogen are really funny together here, even though this is not the best work for either of them. The revelation for me was Randall Park. I've seen him in plenty of movies and shows since this movie's release, but at the time, he was a fresh face. The dude is hilarious. He's one of those famous but not super-famous actors who I really enjoy and will consider seeing anything he's in. Michael Pena is another one.
""The Interview"" is funny, but it's completely non-essential. You can catch on Netflix sometime if you're bored, but this is not a movie you need to go out of your way to watch."

What did you expect going into a movie about interviewing kim jong un starring seth rogen and james franco? Mature jokes with deep political commentary andmarlon brando reincarnated into seth rogen and a usual suspects level plot or sum? Ofc not, it isnt supposed to be that, its supposed to be a movie that makes normal people laugh, not 45 year olds who have watched the entirety of imdbs top 250 list.
Now that my 4 years too late rant is out of the way let me talk about the movie. The idea behind it is genius, it's unlike any comedy ive seen, it's honestly refreshing and although it's about kim jong it doesnt try to be too political or give a lesson or commentary -other than a little bit- about anything cause who cares fr im supposed to laugh not start a conversation.
The fact that north korea hacked sony because of this movie just makes it so much funnier, try to keep it in mind and imagine kim jong un watching it, made this even more hilarious for me on my 3rd watch.
The pacing was good, its less than two hours -as it should be- and manages to get a nice even paced story throughout.
It's also funny asl, it's hilarious fr

It should have been obvious from the very beginning when one of the most controversial rappers Eminem and then Rob Lowe are part of the satire. Anyway this film has great directing, screenplay, cinematography and COMEDIC acting. Rogen and Franco are the best comedy duo with a clear friendship that exists more than just on film since Newman and Redford. The supporting cast does a fine job as well.

This film wanders around political and cultural commentary and holds fervently to slapstick and blatantly offensive humor. That is not to say this is an unappealing style, simply one achieved with little grace or art, but rather a heavy hand and an affinity for swear words. James Franco controlled most aspects of this movie, and given his MO, the film is not a failure, but rather a misstep. Talkshow host Dave Skylark and his friend/producer Aaron infiltrate North Korea at Kim Jong-Un's request (as a fan of the show) and attempt to carry out a CIA orchestrated assassination given their favorable position. Dave and Kim find common ground, and lines are blurred and loyalties muddled. The volatile nature of the plot does rather compliment the style of dialogue and aggressively-uncouth manner of the humor, but the whole thing is heavy handed and quickly becomes abrasive."

" aiming too low
",-0.2732,0.9881,2019-01-04 00:00:00,5,"I picked this film as end-of-the-year entertainment because I was curious about the light comedy that created a lot of noise around it by the time it was released. The stories around the making, the delayed launching, and the disputes after 'The Interview' was premiered in 2014 end by being more interesting than the film itself.Seeing this film four years after its release and remembering the whole scandal at international scale that was caused by it makes one reflect about the changes in both politics and film-making that took place in this rather short interval. Some of the political developments in the relations between North Korea and the United States in these years could not have been imagined even by the creative script writers at Hollywood, and as a result some of the themes of the film are overcome by events. On the other hand the moralistic trends at Hollywood are stronger today than four years ago, and I doubt that some of the jokes in the film would have made it in the more politically correct film industry of 2018.The premises of 'The Interview' have some potential, with the trash TV shows anchor (James Franco) and his producer (Seth Rogen) being recruited by the CIA in order to penetrate the hermetic country and try to assassinate its leader. There is a lot of comic potential in the contrast between the two Americans living a very 'decadent' style of life and their encounter with the realities (fake or true) of the Communist country, in the clash of cultures, and in the errors of translation between languages and perceptions. It's the territory where Sacha Baron Cohen has made some real marvels, but directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen seem to never have intended to go beyond vulgar comedy, with very few (mostly verbal) sparks.The result is a parody that succeeds to extract some laughs but cannot keep the comical pace for the whole duration of the film, becoming almost ridiculous by the end. The satirical approach works better when dealing with the American TV industry, it is clear actually that they know the material much better than the Korean realities and characters which are described using superficial stereotypes. Actors James Franco and Seth Rogen are reasonably funny. 'The Interview' could have been a much better film, but the producers and their team aimed too low in several ways. A few years after its making the film looks already old for many reasons."

My two favorite bros where there, Kim, and Dennis. We did some shooters, toasted life, and kicked back and enjoyed the film.I think everyone knows the basic plot. The opening singing would of had been funny, but reminded too much of real songs done in Germany as performed in ""The Book Thief."" I went into the film wanting to write a negative review so I could tongue-in-cheek praise Kim Jung-Un for trying to save us from another James Franco film. However the first interview with Eminem had me in stitches.It only takes 35 minutes for our guys to get to North Korea. Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen) wants to go there because there are ""a lot of Asian girls there."" Dave Skylark (James Franco) who does the interview, is not a serious journalist, but is a favorite of Kim.There are lots of pop culture and movie references. LOTR is prevalent. There was a line from ""Hitchhiker's Guide..."" and of course where would the world be without the deep songs of Katy Perry. The film also has a diverse sound track and swagger music. I couldn't help but notice the use of Isaac Hayes' cover, ""Walk on By.""The beginning of the film was sharp and was good up until the actual interview when the production turned into slap stick. I understand they rewrote and redid the ending which may have caused this. Hopefully the DVD will have an alternative ending.Guide: Plenty of F-bombs. Brief sex scene. Brief nudity."
" So wrong, yet so right
",-0.5256,0.9974,2018-03-22 00:00:00,8,"'The Interview' was never destined to be a mainstream success. This happens to some films because they're released before their time, have the wrong star, or try and be too clever for their own good. However, in the minority of these cases, the reason the film doesn't succeed is because of pressure from an entire country that doesn't like the way it's being portrayed on screen. At the time of release, the company that made 'The Interview' was under cyber hacking attack by North Korea, forcing them to seriously rethink whether or not to release this film in the cinema. In fact... will I get in trouble from people on the other side of the world just for writing that I enjoyed it?!It's about a mainstream TV chat-show host (James Franco) who finds out that his US low-brow entertainment show is - believe it or not - actually quite liked by the leader of communist state North Korea. He's then offered the once-in-a-lifetime chance to fly to North Korea and do what no journalist has done before, interview its 'glorious' leader, Kim Jong-un. This, he readily accepts because he thinks that once he's interviewed President Kim it will cement his name in journalistic history. However, when the CIA hear of this, they decide that it would be far more beneficial for the rest of the world if James Franco (and his producer, played by Seth Rogen) simply assassinate the 'madman' instead.Now, if you're not too familiar with the Franco/Rogen combo then you might not know that they've starred in numerous films together and are generally pretty good buds in real life. Therefore, once again, they allow their natural chemistry to carry out the dialogue of this movie. However, said 'dialogue' is pretty 'adult' in nature, so expect much of their interactions to be s3x-based or peppered with drug references. The two of them may be good (if you're generally into their particular brand of humour), but I thought that it was Randall Park who stole every scene he was in. For he had the unenviable task of portraying the Leader himself and, in my opinion, did a great job (I'm not saying that Kim Jong-un would act like this in real life, but, for the purposes of a comedy film, I think it's fair to say that this was a good way of showing the man who - currently - could be the biggest threat to the West on the planet).As I said, the humour is adult and quite 'bawdy' at times, but if you can forgive that (and are generally a fan of the two leads and their recent collaborations) then you should enjoy this. They even put in a couple of quite fun action set-pieces in the final act and, although the CGI is a little ropey here and there, I think for a comedy that isn't really an 'action blockbuster' you can forgive this. I definitely think that 'The Interview' could well be the funniest film that uses North Korea as the bad-guys (oh, apart from 'Team America' - in which case 'The Interview' is the funniest 'live action' film about North Korea - and it has a cute puppy. What more could you want?)."

The controversy surrounding this during 2014 pretty much nearly sparked global decimation. This film then became a statement for the freedom of speech and artistic integrity. And despite the depiction of assassinating Kim Jung-Un as a threat...I loved this. Staging an interview with the supreme leader of North Korea who is being probed questions by an eccentric flamboyant entertainer was just magic. It was like a campier version of The Graham Norton Show, mixed in with the same level of violence from The Jeremy Kyle Show. I mean this was bonkers! Fingers are being bitten off, tanks are rolling around to the soothing sounds of Katy Perry's 'Firework' and there's a whole lot of anus jokes. The crude humour might put some people off, and I do believe it is rather excessive...but it's just a bit of fun. No harm done really. James Franco was hilarious and is now possibly one of my favourite comedic actors. Seth Rogen was Seth Rogen. Randall Park...well, brave move sir. I thought the whole comedic timing and screenplay was pretty decent, most I've laughed in a comedy for quite some time which is always an impressive accomplishment. Just seeing Kim Jung play basketball, cry about margaritas and generally seem like a normal laddish lad felt...I don't know...surreal. Exclaiming ""what the actual flip is going on!?"" to my soul as I watched him scream with joy as he drives a tank. My life is now complete. The barrage of random scenes and callback humour can feel exhausting towards the end but to be honest I had so much fun that I really don't care.

",-0.3412,0.609,2018-02-02 00:00:00,1,Humiliating a nation and trying to garner laugh out of it is purely sadistic. This movie serves nothing but evil sentiments. Acting wise also it is worst of all.
" Terribly, Terribly, Terribly Fantastically Good.

" A ridiculously funny propaganda movie!
",-0.2003,0.9798,2018-01-20 00:00:00,10,"Is this movie a propaganda piece, an NWO comedy special? YES! Is this movie a ridiculously funny propaganda piece? A resounding YES! Can James 
Franco be any more absurdly funny then he was in 'The Interview', probably but it's hard to imagine. The guy playing Kim Jong-il was cast perfectly and his interactions with Franco were impossibly funny, simply irrepressibly funny material and performances. Rogan played a rather straight role he was more or less Dean Martin to Franco's Jerry Lewis and it was pitch perfect! I loved the movie and to think I almost didn't watch it because of all the bad press, well had I not watched it it would have been my loss! If you don't watch it, unless you're a tight ass, it will be your loss!"
" Typical American hollywood kerap
",0.0,-0.911,2018-01-18 00:00:00,2,"The film is not funny and quite boring. The worst thing North Korea could do is hack into Sony because it gives this dross more publicity than it deserves.I have seen parts of Atlanta, Chicago, New York and Birmingham that look like real misery holes and far worse than anything depicted in this film regarding North Korea (and those are exaggerations from the mind of a Hollywood director).Wanted to know how half the country voted for a snake oil salesman? Here is the answer! Drumpf is excited that his voters are dumbos"
" Easy-going, well-made satire
",0.0,0.9749,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Such as simple premise for a film - parody North Korea and their crazy dictator, as well as the ridiculous tabloid culture of some ""news"" shows. Dave (Franco) is the talk show host and his best friend/producer Aaron (Rogen) get the chance to interview Kim Jong-un (Park) - a journalistic goldmine. Agent Lacey (Caplan) from the CIA then enlists them to ""take him out"" - plenty of mishaps then ensue!This is Rogen & Goldberg's second co-directing effort (after 'This Is The End') and is much more assured - the jokes are freer, there's more laughs throughout, and the pacing is much faster and doesn't lull anywhere. Canada stands in for North Korea adequately enough and there's some good support cast, as well as great cameos from Eminem, Rob Lowe & Joseph Gordon-Levitt.The ending has plenty of action/violence and gets a little ridiculous, but there's some really funny moments throughout, with Rogen playing a perfect foil to Franco's over-the-top-ness. Has the potential to be racist/offensive for no reason, but never is - just a film that enjoys itself pointing fun at humanity's often stupid emotions and decisions."
" Satire, but not smart satire
",-0.438,-0.2702,2017-12-26 00:00:00,3,"This movie gets a bonus star for exceeding my (extremely low) expectations. There were moments when I actually guffawed, but they were pretty rare. Franco cannot manage this part, and the script cannot manage smart satire. The whole thing devolves pretty quickly into a bad action climax. I don't mind satirizing politics while telling dick jokes, but this movie misses the mark that Team America hit 10 years ago."
" This is the main problem with America
",-0.4019,-0.9663,2017-09-21 00:00:00,1,"America and American film industry really want to sell Kim as a bad leader, they portrait him a nuclear holic, drunk, fat, angry racist president. But the irony is, fast forward 4 years their current president is far more worse than Kim. Just imagine if NK, Russia, China or even a Muslim country had made a film about any of the American Terrorist Presidents. USA would suddenly find interest in that country's democracy and invade it.A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME MOVIE"
" Get past the start and you have a good film
",0.4404,0.935,2017-07-20 00:00:00,7,"I saw this in 2017 and didn't expect much. The first 1/4 of the film was quite poor, as it was dominated with cliché jokes.BUT then the film really picks up and I laughed a lot. The last half of the film, especially the last 1/4, are just great television. Funny and great action scenes.If you want to watch a good comedy then this is the one for you. Lower your expectations and survive the first 1/4 of the film and you will be golden."
" So much potential with so little outcome; Wouldn't Recommend
",-0.2135,0.9983,2017-05-21 00:00:00,5,"The Interview was a joint directorial effort between Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen(whom also stars) and stars James Franco and Randall Park. We follow talk show host Dave Skylark(James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rappaport(Seth Rogen) who are tasked by the CIA to assassinate North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un during a meeting. It's is actually sad how good this movie could have been and how mediocre it actually was. It had the setup of a genius satire, which is perfect for the current climate, but had the payoff of that equivalent to the end of 'Batman V Superman'(fight me on that). This movie is very similar to DC V Marvel: Dawn of the Backlash in the fact it had so much potential and so much marketing surrounding it but upon release it was very disappointing and scrutinised all the potential it had. Some jokes hit so if you feel the need to watch it, then I can't say to shouldn't but I don't feel like it contains enough substance to stand on its own two legs.The premise of this movie(while it upsets our supreme leader) is genius and is perfect, especially considering the tension between the USA and North Korea at the time of this review. Even without the current climate, this movie could have been an amazing satire that COULD have stood the test of time. It doesn't and barely stands up and satirical in today's climate. If they maintained the concept that Kim Jong Un is actually a 'sound lad' and a 'playboy', this movie could have been great with a great message. I think it's clever but also foolish how they spell out the movie within the first 30 minutes. Most of the acting was fine and most of the actors tend to have good comedic timing and improvisation. Seth Rogen was arguably the best part of this movie and keeps this movie from total failure. James Franco was really poor in this movie and he just tried to play the stereotypical dumb guy but he came off as just a jerk who just wan't likable. That is a main flaw with this movie; none of the characters are likable. Movies can work with jerk characters as the leads but every character you need to root for must have some redeeming qualities to make a good movie but none of these characters actually contain genuine human characteristics which make you like them. Randall Park was good as Kim Jong Un(although our multi Oscar winning Supreme leader would have done a much better job) and played both sides of his character very well. Diana Bang was fine as Rook.The cinematography was passable: they kept to camera straight(which is all we need in movies these days, right?). The set design was pretty cool and over the top which was nice but the costume design was pretty generic and dull. This movie's primary goal was to make me laugh and it kind of succeeded. I laughed at some jokes in this movie but it wasn't enough to warrant multiple re-watches.In conclusion, this movie has a solid premise and a reasonable cast so it should have been great. It was mildly funny but not to the point whereas it is a must see. If you want to see this movie, then by all means you may get a kick or two out of it but aside from that, I can't say that you need to see this movie.6/10"
" It is what it is
",0.0,0.7078,2017-05-16 00:00:00,6,"I actually enjoyed this movie because I knew what to expect. It's a Seth Rogan/James Franco flick, so I just watched it to laugh and be entertained for a few hours. It worked for me. It is definitely not the best comedy I've ever seen, but It did have me laughing within the first five minutes.It has a plot that could only be conceived from a late night conversation and large amounts of Mary Jane, but the execution wasn't horrible.I think the people who rate this less than a five either have no sense of humor or they knew nothing about the movie going in. It's a silly comedy. if you're in the mood for a silly comedy, it's worth watching at least once."
" Comedy is easy. Satire is hard.
",0.6124,0.1131,2017-05-07 00:00:00,8,"There's a lot of cheap jokes in this picture, then you realize that every character, every situation, every role, every issue is the butt of the joke. From the ""Entertainment Tonight"" TV gossip star to Kim Jong Un and everyone in between, the whole situation with North Korea; the set-up, the adventure, the peril, the rescue...they're all butts of the jokes. Not every joke hits home, but most of 'em work. And that's not easy."
" It's a good comedy. As long as you see it without any kind of resurrections.
",0.6597,0.9874,2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,"What's not to like about this here? The Comedy? the Bromance? the Franco-Rogen duo? Comedy buddies James Franco and Seth Rogen play the host, Dave Skylark, and producer, Aaron Rapoport, respectively. And in a show called Skylark Tonight, a fictional and popular celebrity news talk show. It just so happens that the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, (played by Randall Park), is a fan of their show. When the CIA learns about Kim's penchant for the TV show, it devises a plan to have Skylark and Rapoport assassinate North Korea's leader.It feels better when you imagine it happening right now in front of you. A real life Comedy duo mixed with a Comic version of ""the most dangerous man on the planet"" right now, and who happens to love ""Firework"" by Katy Perry?Although, the brilliance fades near the end. But still manages to be really entertaining. So I liked it. And would recommend it as a must see for most of you! It's a good comedy. As long as you see it without any kind of resurrections."
" One of the most ignorant movies ever made
",-0.3384,-0.5106,2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,"I couldn't take it for more than 15 minutes. The CIA and Spec Ops should use this instead of waterboarding. Thirty minutes of this would have ISIS killing each other. I can never regain those 15 minutes of my life. The plot lead in was pathetic,the acting was abysmal, and the scenes were a cross between an attempt at humor and a gangsta rap video."
" Not funny, terrible Franco performance, overrated
",0.0382,0.9414,2017-03-30 00:00:00,2,"If it didn't have James Franco in it, maybe it'd be slightly funny. Franco's character is a grotesque caricature and makes it impossible to suspend disbelief. Seth is solid, and scenes without Franco are decent, but the movie isn't funny. If you're happy about this movie ridiculing the dictator, congrats, but this doesn't make it a good movie.2/10 - didn't have one genuine laugh and lost all respect for James Franco."
" pretty good i guess
",0.7269,0.8122,2017-02-18 00:00:00,7,"this is a good movie in my opinion as i am someone who likes seat rodger comedy but i really don't think kim jhon ewn really deserved this blow, i get that most people hate him but i think he had a right to be mad. kimmy only wanted to make America great again and although i don't know much about politics and stuff i don't know what the problem with the wall is, it worked keeping the rabbits out of chink-land way back when so why cant it work in 'merica??? I'm only a simple Australian but it seems as though from what i've seen in grand theft auto America could really use good leader like kim jin eel, (maybe he can take care of that dilf Trevor Philips(Trevor isn't a dad but he can be my daddy any day amaright?)) anyway i wouldn't take the politics too seriously in this movie but enjoy the anal stuff so you can get the most of this film. although apparently he banned it from ever being sold tho so maybe i imagined buying the DVD and watching it?? maybe I'm wrong about all this????"
" Stupid, but just about pulls it off
",-0.296,-0.8671,2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Some movies aim for being stupid, but end up end stupid and awful (Freddy got fingered is the ultimate example!), this movie is obviously stupid, and treads the boarder of being stupid funny and just stupid. I think it ends up being stupid and funny, there are some good jokes thrown in, and I think James Franco plays his real life self, just an absolute git. For those that are wondering if it's worth a watch, when i first heard of the movie it was when it was in the news that it had been banned, and thought it was just a rubbish movie that went out of it's way to be controversial to get more publicity for an easy promotion, which it is.. But, it actually is quite funny. It might be because i was just expecting awful, but this was a nice surprise"
" Some very amusing moments
",0.4391,0.988,2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"There were some truly hilarious moments in The Interview and it's always a joy to see cast members who have obvious natural humour and chemistry reunited time and time again (James Franco & Seth Rogen plus you might spot a few other appearances from Freaks And Geeks Alumni). Good to see a major distribution company backing something of a risqué comedy too. And I like the fact that a comedy movie has such a serious backdrop. James Franco could make me laugh without opening his mouth so he alone would get my vote for his facial expressions alone. This movie had a clear plot, an obvious beginning, middle and climatic end so it made for easy watching, great cameo's and might inspire you to have a think about international relations."
" Haven't laughed this much in ages ... too funny
",0.1078,0.9973,2017-01-19 00:00:00,10,"I've just watched it and to quote a cliché it was laugh out loud funny. James Franco is a massively talented comedy actor who gets all the best scenes. It seems obvious to say as its made by the same people but if you found This is the end hilarious, you'll love this.Im going to watch it again tomorrow as there was so much comedy I'm sure i missed something. Mixed silly stupid jokes with more sophisticated humour...all funny.The cast were all strong and even the celebrity cameos delivered laughs.Franco plays a similar character to the send up he did of himself in This Is The End. He plays Dave Skylark, an in depth interviewer of shallow celebrities.Rogen, who co-wrote & co- directed gives Franco the best part as he plays the straight man as Skylarks producer who is also desperate to be accepted amongst serious journalists. His wish seems to come true when North Koreon dictator Kim Jon Un invites the pair to interview him.Cue CIA intervention, the pair are roped into a plot to assassinate the despot. Needless to say their lack of preparation or expertise bring so many laughs but not in a totally obvious wayWatch it for a good laugh at some clever well written humour"
" awful
",-0.4588,0.3595,2017-01-12 00:00:00,1,"In this pathetic excuse of a movie, the filthy American pigs mock and ridicule the Promised Land of North Korea, the only important place in the world. Filthy capitalist American news hosts attempt to murder our glorious leader, but are too stupid to complete their task. They soon realize that everything bad said about the wise and powerful, all-knowing deity that is Kim Jong-Un is actually a pretty nice guy who didn't want to rule the land but accepted his duty with honor. Soon, however, the American film directors began to litter in propaganda, making it appear that the Kim is actually evil, and that has nothing better to do with his time than ride tanks and listen to Katy Perry. As if he would listen to Katy Perry! Everyone knows he likes opera and K-POP!"
