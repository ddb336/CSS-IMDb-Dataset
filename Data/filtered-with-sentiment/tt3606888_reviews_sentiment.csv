" Beautiful story of James and Bob...
",0.5994,0.7692,2021-03-17 00:00:00,8,"Movie is just beautiful. Story is heartwarming. I loved it. Bob is so cute, especially cat lovers should definetely give it a try. Reflecting drug addiction and the process of getting rid of it in the film is informative and dramatic . But in my opinion, best thing about this movie is this: it is realistic. Movie doesn't show us a pink world. It shows us also bad things and bad people. There are jealous people who envy Bob and James. Or just bad people doing hurtful things for no reason at all. Nevertheless, it hasn't a fully pessimistic look on world. There are still good people who are trying to help James. There is a sincere friend of him. And of course he has Bob the Cat... Additionaly I think it is an important film in terms of showing us the situation and experiences of homeless people. We are shown scenes from the streets, including homeless people. And there is James's touching story."
" Great and hearty
",0.6249,0.9756,2021-01-07 00:00:00,8,"A great and hearty - true life - story.I watched 'A Street Cat Named Bob' back when it was released at the cinema (remember them?) and thoroughly enjoyed it; something that hasn't changed just over four years on. It's a very touching story, crafted together very nicely. I also love cats, so I felt all the cuteness that this offers in that area.The cat(s) steals the show, but big credit also to Luke Treadaway who plays lead character James. He is superb in this. Ruta Gedmintas, Serafina herself, and Joanne Froggatt play their part too.Interested to find out what the, I have to say very unexpected, sequel has to offer."

" A NICE MOVIE TO WATCH!!
",0.5242,0.983,2020-12-21 00:00:00,7,A street cat named Bob is a 2016 British biographical drama starring James Bowen as Luke Treadaway. A really good film very light heated and uplifting to watch. Brilliant directed and with good acting. Such a beautiful movie to watch with the family or if you have children. If you love animals then you will like this movie all I can say is it's definitely a watch. So get the fire on a Sunday evening all cosy with a hot drink and this is the perfect movie to watch. Absolutely loved this film.
" Ginger Cats are the best
",0.6369,0.3976,2020-12-19 00:00:00,7,"I love cats, so films focusing on the fluffy creatures have an immediate appeal to me. This appeal was increased because I have once seen the cat in question. The film version of A Street Cat Named Bob was a loose adaptation of James Bowen's story and it showed the hardships of drug addiction and poverty in a palatable way for mainstrain audiences. The film showed James' struggles, Bob was incredibly cute and well acted considering with the cast featuring Anthony Head, Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt, and Ruta Gedmintas who has gone on to star in His Dark Materials. Luke Treadaway was excellent showing James' struggle when he got agitated when missing a methane dose, and the struggles of going cold turkey. I like the subplot involving James' dad because he was torn from trying to support his son but has a wife that wants to keep him away from his young family."

" Wholesome
",0.0,0.9518,2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,"Based on a true story, a heartwarming tale about Heroin addict James who has lived on the street for a long time with no end in sight. His father owns a business, but has a new family and does not help him. It's hard to get food or a warm bed for James, but everything changes when a street cat suddenly appears in his life. The movie describes how James makes friends (or more) with his vegan neighbour, vows to become clean and make amends. It's an inspiring and moving story about overcoming adversity. The cute cat definitely was a plus as well. Everything in life happens for a reason."
" It is the movie that makes the most of the feelings of the characters.
",0.0,0.9062,2020-11-25 00:00:00,8,Well I think that James and Bob are kindred spirits. I also think that they saved each others lives. I have an affinity with cats; well all life actually especially animals; I have had cats all my life. This is a well told story with some beautifully painted moments that made me feel like I was there - the description was so vivid that my heart pounded in the dramatic passages and I cried in the emotional bits.
" worth watch
",0.2263,0.8905,2020-11-23 00:00:00,7,"Having Bob there gave me a chance to interact with people. They would ask about Bob and I would get a chance to explain my situation at the same time. They would ask where he came from and I'd then be able to explain how we got together and how we were making money to pay our rent, food, electricity and gas bills. People would give me more of a fair hearing. Psychologically, people also began to see me in a different light. Cats are notoriously picky about who they like. And if a cat doesn't like its owner it will go and find another one. Cats do that all the time. They go and live with somebody else. Seeing me with my cat softened me in their eyes. It humanised me. Especially after I'd been so dehumanised. In some ways it was giving me back my identity. I had been a non-person; I was becoming a person again.""---------- book quote"

",0.0,-0.4248,2020-11-18 00:00:00,5,"The reviews sucked me in. It's not half as good as they say. Some really awful acting here, the manic pixie vegan actor in particular. A trite story. Mediocre writing. Starts off strong but around halfway it goes into unicorns and rainbows territory. It's very predictable. It goes like this - good thing, bad thing, good thing, bad thing blah blah. The guy sings well I suppose. Watch it if you like basic films like 'Love Actually'."
" James Bowen's touching story is sensitively handled by director Roger Spottiswoode
",0.0,0.6129,2020-11-07 00:00:00,8,"In 2007, James Bowen (James Treadaway), a homeless man is living rough on the streets of London which can be a cold and hostile place. He spends his days busking in Covent Garden. His life appears to be spiralling further out of control and almost dies of a heroin overdose until he finds a cat who follows him everywhere and soon gives him purpose in life.Given some warmth by top flight Hollywood director Roger Spottiswoode, James Bowen's story and his best selling book on his experiences became a media sensation. The film is sensitively handled and of course has some necessary saccarine for it to appeal to a younger audience is that is, despite its subject matter, very rewarding. Sadly the real life Bob passed away in 2020."
" Curious Incident of a Cat in the Daytime....
",0.3182,0.9775,2020-10-19 00:00:00,7,"Luke Treadaway is superb as the homeless young recovering addict who is determined to try to get, and stay, clean - despite all that the system throws at him. His breadline existence as a street busker is helped by his social worker ""Val"" (Joanne Froggatt) who manages to get him into a council flat where he encounters, and becomes inseparable from, a ginger cat called ""Bob"". Based on a true story, it's a feel good - but not overly sentimental - film about his struggle and determination that also touches on issues around the human spirit (positive and negative) of both himself and his friends - notably ""Betty"" (Ruta Gedmintas) and, of course, the cat! Treadaway is a talented actor who draws us into the character and whom, by the end, is thoroughly convincing as the decent, down on his luck, man that you can't help but like. Roger Spottiswoode captures well the despair and optimism of his evolving situation astutely without over complicating what was undoubtedly a complex set of scenarios for the author."
" Outstanding in every respect

I do however in this case. it is a beautiful story and the acting by everybody, including the feline, was superb. it is definitely a must see. Wished there where more movie which leaves you with a positive feeling instead of the usual blood thirsty and gory Hollywood productions."

" Such a beautiful movie
",0.5994,0.9736,2020-09-02 00:00:00,10,"I just watched this great movie on Amazon Prime. It's about a man who overcame drug addiction & his journey. Sometimes having the strength to care about another soul puts you on track to care about your own. It just so happened that I came across it by accident & so thankful I took the chance. I laughed, I cried & I found myself smiling!"
" A Street Cat Named Bob

His life is altered immeasurably by a cat that turns up and lives with him.Sometimes quite touching, sometimes quite frustrating this is a well acted and put together true story of a man who resolves his issues with the help of a ginger Tom in the face of the many good and many appalling people of London. It is overlong though and occasionally gets sentimental and somewhat disneyesque."
" A beutiful tale with a partially forced plotline paired with excellent acting and emotional highnotes
",0.3182,0.805,2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"8/10This isn't far from an aced mid budget production, good acting (mostly), good plotline (especially regarding rehabilitation), sound and soundtrack are well above exspected, the camerawork is also good and last but not least the tone set (with lighting) finishes it off nicely.
In the base it is a beautiful personal story about survival on the streets and the difference having another soul can make. Most things in it are dead on, the storyline however suffers, but at times it's broken down due to forced events (like every time the cat should be leashed it isn't - while when there is no dangers on the horizon the leash is on), counterlogical characters rationales (Ruta Gedmintas) and inability to fully compensate for bad writing through acting and some against the odds events. If some of the forced events had been given a few more mintes to breathe that could have made a real difference (not solve them but make them smoother).
There are highnotes, well worthy of proper note, in here aswell. Moments where the leads and the supporting cast show brilliance (I've never understood why Anthony Head wasn't more utilised in larger dramas...).Pro's
acting, hitting the emotional notes, soundtrackCon's
Writing (yes most is good, but the few moments really brings it down, could have been a strong 9 instead of a standard 8), slightly rushed (would have done good to give it 10-20 more minutes, with 2-3 more scenes to develop characters and their chemistry), forced plotline at times (could have been executed better more smoothly if the actions or lack thereof had been rationalised better and made logical)."

" Uplifting and inspiring film
",0.4215,0.9923,2020-06-20 00:00:00,8,"Even though i have not read the book i must commend the film is well done and is beautiful and inspiring to watch from start to finish. The script, the nice cinematography, the ensemble casts, especially the main leads James and Betty did a very good job. Nice casting choice as both main characters Luke and Ruta are excellent choices and make a good couples. Both are very likeable characters as Ruta is undoubtedly beautiful. Luke is able to pull off all emotions shown towards Bob, and does all the work for the taciturn Bob in expressing the mutual love.The scores, the music (Luke's real gigs) simply pulls you away...and immerse into James world. As for Bob, we all know that cats are not as good trained actors as dogs, so the director did a good job in catching all those subtle reactions and affection from a cat towards his adopted human.
Sadly, the box office does not do justice on the credibility and quality of the film itself. However, as both a cat lover and a film buff, i would it does not disappoint on both perspectives."

It is heart warming that they used the real cat and adorable that he seems so comfortable with hanging out on the guy's back, but it was just an odd story and 1/2 the time I was concerned for the cat's welfare. I also couldn't help wondering what might happen to other cats who might unwillingly be paired with addicts to help them recover based on this story.

" The Cat's Meow! Two strays find and save each other. A lovely film!
",0.8217,0.9924,2019-11-16 00:00:00,9,"This movie, based on a true story by James Bowen, is the cat's meow!A young man called James, (played with raw delicacy by the talented and likeable Luke Treadaway), is a drug addict living on the streets and struggling to survive physically and emotionally. He is estranged from his father who has a wife that doesn't have compassion or tolerance for him and his situation. To make money to eat, James sings as a busker at London's trendy Covent Gardens; hardly anyone listens.During a visit to his drug counselor after a near fatal overdose, Val notices his guitar and asks if he can sing. James plays a song, his gentleness shines through, Val is touched and, believing - or wanting to believe - that James can get his life back, arranges for housing for him.Enter a street cat named Bob, (played to purrfection by the real Bob!), a gorgeous, extraordinary stray ginger who steals into James' new flat one night and is discovered eating his cornflakes.These two strays, who are in need of each, hit it off! Both are generous and loving and help each other flourish. Bob follows James everywhere and adopts him. He takes to riding on James' shoulder's and charming crowds everywhere, which draws in positive human interaction that had been missing in James' life, including attracting large crowds for his music, which was nice and well played.I LOVED this film, which I would describe as a buddy picture and love story. I found it to be a realistic portrayal of life on the street, and ultimately a lovely and uplifting movie without being sappy."

After searching for something uplifting to watch for my movie night, i decided to give this a go. Oh boy what a tear jerker it is. I have experience of addiction myself although not of drugs,but addiction is an addiction and it is hard to get rid of it. Anyone who would do anything to get rid of it deserve my most respect and James Bowen is one of them. The struggle is real,the road to overcome the addiction is hard, your surrounding could kill your motivation and this movie successfully potrayed all that.If you're in the mood for something to lift your spirit,this is the movie. The feeling is the same when i finished watching The Way Way Back. A nice cameo too by the real James Bowen. Such a feel good movie deserved to be watch on family movie night."

",-0.4023,0.6488,2019-06-29 00:00:00,6,"For a feel-good dramedy, what this is supposed to be, this movie failed to give us a character to cheer for. The cat was good (probably because I am a cat-lover), but the guy was very unlikable, and I felt his arc was very undeserved. He failed a lot in life, and second chances just came up his way - he didn't do anything to deserve them (except adopting a stray cat, which he didn't really want to do until it gave him profit). So, at the end, when it all ended with a sing-along, It really didn't feel right for me.On the other note, technical aspsects were good. Shots with the cat were probably very hard to make, so they should be appreciated."

" A story about the amazing healing effects of animals
",0.5859,0.9169,2018-08-11 00:00:00,10,"Such a good movie; it touches on heavy human issues like homelessness, addiction, and family dysfunction, and the importance of having support, which comes in all shapes and sizes, and in this case, in a cat. It touches on the special healing quality of the unconditional love and support that comes with having a pet. Animals are there where people sometimes fail."
" Decent, if anodyne
",0.0,0.9953,2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"As James struggles to escape heroin addiction, busking in Covent Garden doesn't prove successful. When a ginger tom cat adopts him (and vice versa), he finds that having it perch on his shoulders becomes a strong selling point, and his growing relationship with the cat and mounting local celebrity status help his escape from the depths of addiction.This true-life story is nicely, if undemandingly, realised. Given a family-friendly certificate in the UK, James' addiction and weaning off methadone is shown perhaps a little more gently than might actually have been the case, but that doesn't matter: the story is inspirational and merits a little de-sensationalising in order to deliver it to an audience which might benefit from the message it contains.Luke Treadaway delivers a sympathetic James (I was so glad when he washed his hair at the end), Joanne Froggatt is good as his social worker, Ruta Gedmintas is appealing as neighbour and possible future love interest Be''y (it says ""Betty"" in the cast list, but glottal stops are substituted for t's on the soundtrack), but lets talk about Bob.David Head wasn't given a great deal to do as James' estranged father but, by gum, he was good.I saw this in a cinema where the audience contained quite a lot of cat lovers. I could tell this, because whenever Bob got a closeup, which was quite frequently, there was a communal ""Aah"" from the selection of, mostly, ladies. I've got to be honest, I found this irritating. I mean, I wouldn't kick a cat (well, not deliberately), but come on!So my verdict on this is that it is a moderately heartwarming and uplifting true-life saga, a bonus if you like cats, but do try not to see it in a cinema full of moggyphiles."

",0.5647,0.945,2018-04-20 00:00:00,5,"There is a certain charm to 'A Streetcat Named Bob (2012)' that mostly works its way to the surface in the more feel-good sequences revolving around the titular cat, who's good-natured antics are easy to smile at and innately brighten up the film. The piece is generally formulaic and predictable, though, to the point that it seems as though it's going through the motions of a story we've seen countless times before, without any substantial stylistic or story hooks to differentiate itself or keep us especially engaged. It's not that the picture is bad or even that it ever fails to entertain, it's just that it never creates more than a serviceable level of attachment to its relatively one-note characters or consistently low-stakes story and as such remains a passive viewing experience throughout, even when it briefly dips into the grittier side of being a recovering addict or when it's feline star does something undeniably cute, like give its owner a high-five. 5/10"

",0.0,0.3089,2018-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Not quite, though both stories are about a man with an orange cat. This is about a younger man, who doesn't hit the road, and instead is a recovering drug addict in continuous danger of falling off the wagon. But when a stray orange cat enters the apartment he had been sequestered in, he finds a reason to live again. Indeed, having the cat around makes him more attractive to people, whom he normally has trouble dealing with.This movie does not degenerate into schmaltz. He meets a young female neighbor, but they stay friends and not lovers. Only his father has feelings for him; he is still estranged from his other relatives. A friend who is also drug addict ends up dying from his habit. The cat himself causes trouble by running off at the wrong times.In the end, though, the story of the cat eventually becomes a bestselling book for him, so he no longer has to make a living by panhandling. This might seem like a Hollywood ending, except that this story is all true. Recommended, especially if you're a cat person."
" Calming and inspiring
",0.6705,0.9552,2018-03-22 00:00:00,10,"I personally identified with this character, minus the drug addiction and homelessness aspects of his life, in that I have been completely shunned by my family, with no effective support system in life. However, the main character had it much worse than me, and I feel inspired by how he overcame his challenges with the help of his stray cat friend. The film also appealed to me since I am a supporter of animal rights. There are very strong themes of hope in this film. This film is notable in that it is one of the few films that examines the issue of homelessness and animal rights in a non judgmental way. Brian Ghilliotti"
" Not easy movie, but I liked it
",0.4583,0.9926,2018-03-16 00:00:00,8,"I have to premise that I am strongly convinced that animals are just animals. I feel annoyed by people who say ""Animals are better than humans: they don't betray you "" and bulls**t like this.Thus I hated people who ignored James without the cat and are kind and generous with the cat. Just like I hate cat and/or dog videos on social media.
In my country, in Italy, there are more pets than babies, and I'll be happy with our extintion as a species because we deserve it.On the other side there is the story of redemption of James who finds an aim through the cat who becomes his project. I am happy with this, but is it not a kind of sad to think that no human being, not even his own father, has helped him to recover?One moment: a decent person in this movie does exist and is Val, the social worker. She is the actual heroine (no pun intended).Social workers are at very high risk of burning out because they usually cannot see very much good results of their (hard) work.
I sincerely admired the character of Val. She believed in James and gave him a home and advices and after all James success was also her success.I did not find the movie so embroidered as other reviewers have said before me. The story is quite harsh and it is harshly told. Think at the sequence when he suffers for the methadone suspension! It was like Hell on Earth, and it was great that James succeded in healing. Not easy, and it was finely descripted.Acting was fine as Luke Treadaway did not push too strongly on the pleased compassion key.
Directing was also fine and tones were not unbalanced even in the most dramatic moments, like the death of his mate.To me one of the toughest scene was when the lady wanted to BUY the cat and James told her if she wanted to sell her child. The lady was convinced that the cat had the right to have a home, her home, giving for granted that James was not a decent owner.Also when James says he was called ""sir"" for the first time AFTER he got the cat.
The portrait of human misery in my opinion. If one gives a s**t about junkies, then he should care even less about a man with a cat!"

Sometimes watching an uplifting film without the need of serious drama or constant character deaths is just what the doctor ordered...or in this case the veterinarian. Homeless, addicted to drugs and constantly high, busker James believes he has hit rock bottom. But when he stumbles across an injured ginger cat in his newly sheltered accomodation, his life changes forever...and for the better. The street cat named Bob is played by Bob who is the real Bob that is the street cat Bob...yeah. Undeniably, Bob is adorable and that is coming from someone who despises domesticated felines. However, beneath the cutesy exterior is an emotive story about second chances. Just when you think life couldn't get any worse, hope is just around the corner...in the shape of a cat. Now, addressing the subject of drug addiction and homelessness may have been brushed over slightly too much but there are scenes that tackle this and do evoke a sense of power. The problem I find with 'nice' films like these is that they are unmemorable. The chances of me remembering this in a week's time are slim, but it's entirely watchable and what I would class as a ""Sunday afternoon"" film. Luke Treadaway surprisingly holds the film on his shoulders as Bob sits on them. Various scenes were weak in the acting department but just take it with a pinch of salt, it's fine. It's the uplifting story and the fact it all happened that really provides the entertainment. Loved the POV camera shots of Bob's perspective as he rummages around a bush or attempts to catch a mouse, reminiscent of the old Tom & Jerry cartoons. The supporting cast members were weak and I would've liked more attention aimed towards James' backstory. However, aside from the predictabilities, this is an enjoyable watch and, if anything, has heightened my love for cats. I no longer despise them...I just dislike them."

No, it's not a no-frills down and dirty look at the horrors of drug addiction/withdrawal or the hell of living on the street, but it gives a glimpse of those things while presenting the moving - even at times inspiring - story of James Bowen (and of course Bob).It's a film you can enjoy without needing to be in the mood for intense and provocative intellectual stimulation, but is definitely not lightweight either. Nicely balanced and fun to watch, I'd be happy to recommend it."
" A Street Cat Named Bob - Features A Curious Mix
",0.3182,0.9094,2017-10-25 00:00:00,8,"After reading a brief synopsis of this movie figured it could be interesting ‚Äì then followed a strong recommendation from friends. It certainly proved worth the time and money (if sadly not quite so for the producers). This is the sort of project I imagine several directors may have taken a look at the script then run screaming from the room. There's actually not much more the producers could have achieved with the material - other than the treatment they've ended up with. The initial story is a grim battle to overcome drug addiction and death among the homeless. Add to this, the heavy participation of a cat - which meant the final product then, had to please two totally opposite audiences. The outcome is a decent balance between a deathly harrowing real life situation and a rising-above-the-rot victory. Among other things, the movie shows us it's a bit of a worry that people don't seem to want to give to street dwellers and beggars but, add a cat to your situation and the money comes rolling in. Yes, most everyone has a different attraction to Animals ‚Äì rightly or wrongly.This is relatively easy to understand, to a degree. I suppose many people have become cynical through being 'taken-for-ride' by the con artists - who spoil it for those genuinely doing it tough. What lifts this one above being an overly sugary mix is the fact this partnership, is built on the unique need to survive on the mean streets and simultaneously overcome the devil on the skids. The Cat (played by the real Bob) is an undeniable trooper and these hapless lost souls find strength to go that extra mile from each other. Performances are neat enough and the production manages to look impressive - even while trundling out some grim London situations. Some songs seem manufactured for the movie but they work well, so this is not a drawback. It's a delicate balancing act but the message is delivered in such a manner - that most audiences should come away with something to feel positive about and, regard it all as well worth the time."

" One or two weak spots, but it's hard not to be moved by this heartwarming story
",0.5248,0.971,2017-08-02 00:00:00,7,"James Bowen (Luke Treadaway) is a homeless man who's recovering from drug addiction and, in order to try and get by, he makes his money by busking in Covent Garden. After suffering a relapse, James is given one last lifeline by his drug counsellor Val (Joanne Froggatt) whom manages to acquire him some accommodation on the proviso that he cleans up his act. However, James' rocky road to recovery begins with the most unlikely of packages in the form of a stray cat named Bob...Sometimes it is the simplest of films that are often the most effective and A Street Cat Named Bob is a good case in point. What we effectively have here is the story of a young man who has made some bad choices in life and is desperate to sort his life out and get clean. When a stray cat is introduced into his life this gives him something other than himself to focus his attention on and he basically chooses to put the cat before himself which of course makes him an endearing character - in spite of him being a recovering drug addict.The other thread to the story is James' developing friendship with Betty (Ruta Gedmintas) which basically gives James an insight into what a normal existence could be like; one gets the impression that he probably hadn't had too many healthy influences in his life for quite some time up till this point. The friendship played out between Gedmintas and Treadaway is sweet and the pair have a wonderful, easy-going chemistry about them.One of the main standout points in this film is Luke Treadaway who takes us on this emotional journey as the real life James Bowen in wonderful fashion - his commitment and dedication is evident on screen and he is never less than 100% convincing (this is made all the better when you remember that he probably spends half of the film talking to a cat).As good as this film is I think it's fair to say that it has one or two weak spots; the thread with Bowen's parents seemed to be clumsily thrown into the story without much real thought or development and I couldn't help but feel that the film wouldn't have been any different if they weren't mentioned at all? The screenplay is also a bit safe and clinical; for example in its early stages virtually every problem that Bowen encountered was able to be resolved without too many issues yet in the latter stages of the film everything seems to go wrong for him despite his best efforts to get his life on track. I can only assume that this approach has been employed to make the picture more dramatic, but it does render some aspects of the picture to be somewhat unbelievable. The same approach seems to have been adopted with Bowen dealing with his drug addiction making the narrative feel slightly uneven at times.Still this is a very good film that is funny, heart-warming, uplifting and inspirational and just goes to show that anyone can turn their life around if they have the desire to do so. In spite of some of its weaknesses, it is still a film that's brimming with both positivity and likability."

And the main reason I liked it was because it did not focus on the negatives, sure it covered them off as drug addiction is a problem, but the film was able to show what support is out there and how friendships are never more important than when you are at your lowest. Basic premise of the film is man finds stray cat while he is living with addiction, and the cat gives him a purpose in life. Oh, and add to that the love I have for cats, and this was a good movie for me."

If even one in ten addicts' recovery stories were this successful, then a quarter of my friends wouldn't be dead.Let me put it this way: ""A Street Cat Named Bob"" might be a wonderful feel-good film for the masses to enjoy, but it's a movie. They tell you this film is based on a true story and I of course believe that, but I'd wager all of my money that the REAL James Bowen had A LOT TOUGHER of a time getting his life straightened-out than this movie depicts.

I've seen this kind of thing in Real Life: my wife rarely communicates with other Human Beings, but introduce her to a cat (kittens, especially) and she's a different person; the Change in her character is truly remarkable. I, myself, have learned more than a little about Empathy from a succession of Furry Friends. (In the documentary UNLOCKING THE CAGE, lawyers argue that Animals have some Basic Rights; that they're sentient and have feelings and their own languages- and they're Right: anyone who's ever gotten to know an animal can attest to that.) (Not all animal stories have happy endings: across the street from me lives a 19-year old psychopath who strangled two kittens and buried them in his back yard. The police uncovered the bodies, which he then placed in the middle of the street and set afire. A week later, at 4a.m., he set fire to an automobile in his own back yard, then set my recycling bin on fire. If ever an animal needed to be put in a cage... Another not-so-happy local story: an animal hoarder had 30 kittens on her property. The authorities rounded them all up and promised to ""put them down"" by this past Monday- yesterday- if they weren't adopted. I haven't seen nor can I find online a follow-up story. I can only assume the worst...) A STREET CAT NAMED BOB is a tale well worth the telling, and a ride definitely worth taking."

I didn't know anything about this film but was immediately drawn to the title because of it's novelty, and it was a worthwhile viewing, though definitely not a cinematic masterpiece. I never heard the term 'busking' before so there was a little bit of British street education in there thrown into the mix. The thing that bothered me throughout the whole story, and it's probably being picky, but when James (Luke Treadway) started getting on his feet and making some money, he could have helped himself out by getting a razor and cleaning up a bit. It might have helped him some during those encounters with the police and other authorities. Overall not a bad little film with some poignant things to say about folks dealing with drug addiction and trying to get clean. Particularly interesting to me was when James expressed his admiration for Bob because he got a man to call him 'Sir'. Occurring near the end of the story, that moment made it worthwhile to hang around and see James make something of himself."

Being quite fed up with excruciatingly tedious or pretentiously horrific movies, I decided to watch something that could make me feel good. How selfish of me to choose hope rather than politically correct grittiness and pain...Luckily this movie delivered exactly what I expected: some hope and comfort and plenty of Bob. Based on the real life story of James and Bob the cat, we follow James attempts at kicking his heroin habit. Some glimpses into the world of the homeless in London are gritty and realistic enough for me.Once James gets settled in flat, he is visited by Bob the cat in search of food and protection. Turns out, Bob is injured and James spends his meager few quids to pay for Bob's medicine. At first reluctant to take care of Bob, James realizes that being committed to another living creature can give him the strength he needs to lead a decent life.Bob the cat plays himself and I was glad he was not ""humanised"". Still, he remains a most amazing cat, apparently not scared or annoyed by loud noise and crowds. James and Bob get to be local celebrities and the rest is history: the books and now the movie about the busker and Bob with his little scarves. Delightful - regardless of what ""serious"" critics may write."

",0.8442,0.9984,2017-05-16 00:00:00,7,"I like many of you out there have seen and heard of many an odd story in my life but if you'd have told me a few years ago that I would've watched and enjoyed a film about a homeless musician/recovering drug addict that strikes up an unlikely friendship with a stray ginger cat, I would've laughed and said ""you're having me on"" but what makes this scenario even stranger is A Street Cat Named Bob is a film about just that, and a true story.Seasoned director Roger Spottiswoode (the man who gave us slobbery dog comedy Turner and Hooch) finds himself here adapting James Bowen's best-selling autobiography of his drug overcoming's and heart-warming friendship with his 4 legged best mate Bob as the two help each other out and become inseparable along the way.There's not a whole lot of ""big"" conflict or set-up's in A Street Cat Named Bob (unless you count cat chases as big events) but there's simple joys and emotion to be found in the small moments Bob shares with Bowen and Bowen's journey to get his life back on track is a great human interest story, no doubt helping the success of his book for all those that may not feel inclined usually to call felines a favourite.Spottiswoode (who over uses cat POV camera moments), it could easily be argued, could've made more of key moments of Bowen's story, in particular his trials going cold-turkey off drugs that is here relatively quickly passed over in favour of more shots of Bob looking cute and while Bowen is a relatively likable down on his luck presence in the film, you do wish you felt a little more connection to him or that he would look for a more meaningful job.This connection issue is hard to pinpoint as Luke Treadaway does a fine job in his role even if it's a relatively thankless task trying to act alongside a cat (who here is even played mostly by the real-life Bob!) but it doesn't end up being all that important in the big scheme of things as at the heart of this tale lays a story that only the most hard-hearted of movie-goers won't enjoy and perhaps shed a tear or two at along the way.Final Say ‚Äì It's been a long time between (milk) drinks since our last lovable feline centric hit but with A Street Cat Named Bob we have our newest whisker clad winner! It may not ever threaten to become a classic and it's sprinkled with movie-making emotional manipulation but this smile inducing true story that's told optimistically and light heartedly is a likable event that acts as one of the year's most notable feel-good experiences.3 ¬Ω cans of tuna out of 5"

Moonlight is a depressing, tedious flick which is grossly over praised and rewarded and in effect gives the impression that being a drug dealer is somehow cool. A Street Cat Named Bob on the other hand is based on a true story and shows the great evil of drug dealers and in a hugely entertaining way shows how a recovering drug addict can turn his life around with determination and in this instance thanks to the help of a remarkable stray cat. Quality performances from all the cast especially the lead actor and the super star cat Bob.

",0.6369,0.9753,2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,"First, a confession: I am an animal lover, and own two cats, so I came to this film disposed to like it.To me, the central, and almost universal, message of this film is that everyone needs to feel loved - be it by a parent, a sibling, a spouse, a friend or a pet. My son had gone through a particularly difficult break-up with his long-time girlfriend and went into an emotional tailspin. He was depressed and we worried about his mental health. Then we adopted a black and white tuxedo cat named Max. Max did for our son what Bob did for James - offered unconditional love, which was returned in kind. Beyond that, Bob showed James that he was worthy of being loved - that he was more than his addition. It is hard to be loved when you don't think you are worthy of it, and we see that when James' father finally opens his heart to his son, who was lost but now is found.This film not only will warm the heart, it also speaks to the most fundamental emotional need we all have, and how we can overcome our inner demons with strength of love."

It was actually quite well done and the acting strong and fun. Well done to the cast for taking it on because it could have been saccharine but it wasn't. In the end it was about hope and love and compassion and the power of animals as true companions during the best and worst of times. Based on real life homelessness and addiction it managed to bring all of it to a broad audience. film critics are a hard hearted bunch but audiences are not, and this one clearly appealed to most with a beating heart, a love of animals, and compassion for the truly down and out."

" In the tough time, they have found one another.
",-0.128,0.9988,2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,"After taking a week off from the films, now I'm back with this one. It is a British film based on the book of the same name, which is inspired by a real person and his cat. Well, it might be wrong to say 'his cat', because according to this film, I learnt that they have found one another. So nobody belongs to no one, except in human perception its 'his cat' and that's how this story goes.The title reminded me a classic film, but this is nothing like that one. If fact, it is a very suitable title name. How many people do you think gets a chance to represent themselves for the film version, excluding documentaries. Here Bob the cat had got one. He was so perfect. I'm not really a cat person, but when I was small I lived among lots of them and they all are nothing like this Bob. So if I want one, I need exactly like the Bob.The story is about a young man, James, who is a drug addict. Living on the street, singing to get close to enough money to feed. Sometimes frustratingly short to buy a meal, leads back to the needles at the time he tries his best to free from them. Having no friends and family for support, that's how he meets Bob. Bob is a stray cat who snuck into the James house and instantly they had become friends. All Bob wanted was a safe place and an owner to feed him. And for James, to divert attention from his issues.Humans and animals won't talk, but all those great relationships are built with wonderful understanding. I have seen many films based on man and animal bond, and there's nothing new from this, yet very inspiring. This tale was told from James perspective, having Bob alongside, but very nicely revealed how things change when we start to commit to something with a great support.‚ùùYou got yourself a lifelong partner there. Better friends than people, they are.‚ùûFrom the outside, it looks like another 'Inside Llewyn Davis'. A man with no future, having a guitar in one hand and a cat in another, roaming the city. Other than that it is totally a different film. Well cast and made a film. The female lead looked like on cosplay. There's a little romance, but the focus always has been James and Bob. Even there are many scenes from Bob's perspective, like through his eyes how things look. Going after a mouse, travelling on the bus and bicycle, performing on the street, the camera literally on the ground to reveal that angle of the story.In a country like India, all domestic animals including pet animals roam casually everywhere without bothering about any threat. But elsewhere, like as in this film in England, one must get a license to have a pet. What I meant is, people are not used to those animals on the street and when they see one, they go like 'oh, so cute', 'so sweet'. Anyway, Bob and James won the many hearts. When they get on the street, it will be a spotlight. Crowd throng to see them, the rare partnership led them to fame. That was not their intention, but it helped them to overcome poverty.The pet lovers would love this film. Despite the original theme is darker with drugs, the film was fun and friendly for almost all ages. Seems like a holiday film, particularly to watch during Christmas. Well, it came on that season, but I saw it only now and I'm happy I did not give it a miss. This is a good film for families, so recommended it to them. Meanwhile, there's a follow-up book and I'm hoping that they would turn it as well a film. I don't know the book, but after watching this one, I feel it is worth it. So waiting for any official confirmation.8/10"

I can only presume the book, on which this movie is based on, must be way more entertaining. I definitely did not experience the ""feel good"" factor a lot of the reviewers here dare you not to have after seeing this film."

" A gritty tale of drug recovery and a ginger moggie called Bob.
",0.0,0.9947,2017-03-19 00:00:00,7,"It sounds like a Disney-style pet-hero tale, but A Street Cat Named Bob (2016) is anything but cute. It's a harrowing and ultimately heart-warming true story of a recovering drug-addict desperately trying to reclaim his life with all the odds stacked against him. Shunned by human society, his saviour is a ginger moggie called Bob.James Bowen (Luke Treadaway) comes from a broken family and was on drugs for many years. His remarried father does not want him around and friends are scarce on the streets where drugs are everywhere and bashings common. Just as he looks like losing his battle with drugs, a sympathetic support worker finds him his own place to live. He ekes out a living by busking, with the coins earnt more for sincerity than talent. One day a hurt cat sneaks into his flat, offering companionship and something to love. Soon the couple are a performing duo with Bob the cat sitting on his shoulder or guitar doing high-fives on cue. The crowds love it, he meets a girl, and a future seems possible. But first he must come off methadone which he is told is like ""the worse flu you have ever had multiplied by a hundred""; the withdrawal scenes confirm the prediction.Being an adaptation of an autobiography imparts a semi-documentary feel to the film that has little depth or tension. The only sign of originality is the moggie. This is not necessarily a criticism, as the film is based on a real life rather than action-driven fiction. It also provides space for the film to take a more light-hearted view on what life is like being down-and-out with a cat. So expect several scenes of busking, chatting to Bob, and the obligatory dog-chases-cat skit. The filming gives special emphasis to Bob's point of view, with camera's tucked inside mouse-holes and other moggie-level places that bring a child-like perspective to the story. Treadaway is believable as a permanently dishevelled street survivor but the film's only interesting personality is his maybe-or- maybe-not girlfriend Betty (Ruta Gedmintas) whose incongruously glamorous presence almost dominates the story. Needless to say, Bob's acting is superb.Pet-hero films are a genre that exploit audience's love of animals and this one mercifully avoids the usual tropes and tricks of the talking-animal narrator. While entertaining, it also offers an idealised version of reality that would be the envy of many who struggle with drug-dependency in a world not even fit for animals. Few homeless street dwellers achieve fame and it is ironic that so much of Jamie's rehabilitation is credited to a cat. No doubt conservative policy makers who are responsible for alleviating homelessness and funding drug rehabilitation will increasingly turn to cat-shelters for solutions. But it is undoubtedly a feel-good story despite some gritty realism and one that will please enthusiastic cat-lovers everywhere."
" epic a true cinematic treasure
",0.6124,0.6199,2017-03-19 00:00:00,10,I watched about 20 minutes before even remembering they were acting I was truly swept away by this dirty gritty beautiful journey of a good soul taken so low into darkness a true master piece that time will show was beyond a story but a peace of art history. This film takes you through every emotion even complete fear then hope its shockingly painfully good.

" The redemption of a lost soul
",-0.3182,0.9655,2017-03-10 00:00:00,8,"I have to admit, this story passed me by. Up until the release of this movie, I had no knowledge of the story. So, without the expectancy of an avid fan, I watched the movie. At first it made me uncomfortable. Here was a guy, crushed by drug abuse and already looking like a train wreck. His zombie like world was gray and foreboding. His future was bleak and his lifestyle was demeaning. Even though he had some support from his case management lady, James just saw his life as misery and the drugs helped mask it. The intervention of the cat, later named Bob, could have been a fleeting one, but the two bonded through a need for each other. In reality, two lost souls. Without spoiling the basis of the movie, it is, basically a journey back to normality, one step at a time. The scenes involving the cat are pure eye candy. This is no ordinary cat by any means. He has an almost zen nature about him. He became the bridge James needed, to be seen by the public as a human being, rather than some faceless busker living on the street. I would not recommend this as film for young children to see. Even though the drug scenes are brief, they are dark and harrowing at times. The acting is flawless and the cinematography is well done. The cat point of view snippets are a nice touch. A wonderful mix of dark and light moments in the telling of the story. It will make any one smile by the end of it. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. Everyone needs a friend like Bob at sometime in their lives."
" boring ,cliche n uninspiring
",-0.3182,0.9646,2017-03-09 00:00:00,2,this is another film about the problems of developed world & its society which spite of all the material gains it has feels hollow & substance less....in western societies of independent and nuclear families there are several cases of so much lonely and depressed or unemployed young people that it gets scary for us people living in underdeveloped world or so called third world countries...at least we see more optimism in our society....after watching recent films like fences/ Manchester by sea/ nocturnal animals/ moonlight/ king jack/ bill Lynn's long walk/ American honey/ Jackie/ Christine/ captain fantastic and then this one adapted from a best seller ..i can't help compare it with films like the salesman (iran) or Dangal (india) and i realized that optimism is lacking in Hollywood or British films nowadays... firstly i don't understand why make a cat more important then a human being and whats so special about this story....there are several other ways to get inspired to leave drugs and be sincere in life...why such a facade...this film is certainly not a survival guide and doesn't make me feel inspired or smile my way out of theater...its more pretentious and fake if compared to films dealing with real issues
" Not the cats whiskers. More like what's in the litter tray.
",0.4201,0.9849,2017-03-05 00:00:00,4,"Can you get fed up of hearing a cat mew and purr? As a dyed-in-the- wool feline lover, my answer just yesterday would have a resounding 'no', but after suffering through the underwhelming, clich√©-ridden waste of 100 minutes that is 'A Streetcat Named Bob' my answer is in the positive without even hesitating.Every scene it's in, we have the titular Tom making the aforementioned dubbed-in noises constantly, until it becomes so distracting my enjoyment of the film suffered as a result. As a direct comparison, when was the last time you saw a dog movie that had non-stop (and I DO mean non-stop) barking and growling from beginning to end? Exactly. The surfeit of cat sounds here is incomprehensible, intrusive and completely unnecessary.Despite all that though, the puss is still the best thing in the movie. Who can possibly enjoy these one-dimensional characters, including the nicest homeless drug addict you're ever likely to not meet in the lead, his obnoxious vegan stereotype girlfriend and his estranged father who, in true movie tradition, he has a tearful 'reunion' with at the end? The script lacks the emotional weight and resonance to carry such a moment, and most right-minded people's tissue collection will remain completely dry.Finally, we're told this is 'Based On A True Story' the BASED bit being the actual caveat. For example, did our hero REALLY earn next- to-nothing for his many busking sessions, but as soon as he attaches a cat to a lead, starts making the big bucks? Are people really that shallow? Especially as what he's playing amounts to little more than pretentious navel-gazing piffle.Add to that an incredibly predictable script where every little 'bump in the road' is telegraphed way in advance before being solved in minutes, and you have an entirely forgettable cinematic experience hastily assembled to cash in on a successful book. Shame the profit margin didn't match their artistic endeavours, though. Not by a long chalk. 4/10"
" A nice and cute movie
",0.7003,0.9817,2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"""A street cat named Bob"" is a nice movie. It delivers what you expect of it, that is, a story with some realism, good acting, a relative straightforward script, and a nice relationship between a guy and a cat. The acting of Luke Treadaway is good and believable, it won't win an academy award, but you buy that he is a recovering drug addict and the relationship he develops with Bob the Cat.Ruta Gedmintas plays an almost stereotypical hippie girl, but she comes off OK and Joanne Froggatt is OK as James' guardian angel.So yes, this movie won't win any award, but it will make you spend a good time with a nice story."

" Better than 10 Hollywood blockbusters
",0.4404,0.7925,2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not absolutely perfect artistically, but considering all elements of the movie as a whole I think this is one of the best movies I have seen in last decade. And, as a movie lover, I have seen a LOT.Why do I think so? Because it touches so many important issues in a deeply moving way. The question of fundamental selfishness and unfairness of success-oriented Western society where weak and less fortunate are stepped over, left behind and blamed for things that are not their fault. (Main character, James). Where your own family disowns you for the fact that you are the ""sensitive one."" Keeping the facade as versus truly loving and having compassion for someone. General attitudes towards homeless people and animals. And, the theme that I am very passionate about: the relationship between human and animal, and treating an animal as an equal companion, not a ""pet"", destined to meet the emotional needs of a human - but not vice versa. I love the fact that the film so boldly showcases James love for his cat and treating his cat as a human person. Most people in the world still treat and think of animals as objects. Even the most pampered pets are little more than fluffy toys or accessories. The children abuse is a widely recognized issue this days but the daily abuse of animals by humans is equally important issue. What happens in the farms is often beyond horrible. Animal rights activists and people who deeply love and care for animals are often ridiculed and thought of as crazy. Often people assume that if you love an animal as deeply as you would love a human then this is some sort of ""substitute"" for human relationship - while it is not. James and Bob love for each other is boldly shown as normal and equal to ""human loving human"" and I love that about the film. Film about James and Bob shows what the relationship between a man and higher vertebrae animal should be: the relationship of equals, treating the animal as ""person"" with his /her rights similar to human. We should execute our superiority only in terms of helping the animal such as providing food or medication if they are ill or starving but not using them for food, fur or entertainment or curing our emotional problems without giving anything in return. I like the fact that James love interest was vegan and through her character the general mass abuse of animals by humanity was spoken of. I also liked the fact that they did not try to over dramatize the story it but kept it real, the chain of events made up of little daily encounters and struggles in James life. I have lived in London and all the situations and characters that James encountered looked realistic to me. I think the general setting and atmosphere of London life was well portrayed.Mr. Tearaway performance as James was incredibly touching and real. Also the other characters in the film were well executed and came across as believable human beings. He had a good chemistry with his love interest, who was also a colorful character. I also loved the fact that the director at many occasions used the POV camera for the cat.If there is anything to(constructively)criticize about this movie,then perhaps the cats personality and character could have had more attention. After all, he was one of the two main characters and Bob-James relationship was the vertebrae of the story. The director used physically cats POV camera but I wished he would have found the ways to show cats psychology and his side of attachment to James more. Something was lacking in this department in spite of cat looking incredibly cute of course, but while director did a very good job getting into James head, he should have got into cats head too. There would have been lots of ways/artistic tricks to show cats inner life more, his love, worries, attachment etc.At the moment it is more like pretty footage of a cute cat. Also I wish the director/scriptwriter would have been more heavy handed on these stupid organizations and institutions who put a starving person into an impossible situation -like prohibit the person busking while this is his only way to earn income. Or blame him for breaking the rules of Big Issue selling while the incident was not his fault. I have not been homeless in London but I have experienced first handed the stupidity and numb ignorant cruelty of British bureaucracy and the upper-handed selfishness even of those organizations who kind of help homeless but do it in a very selfish and ignorant way. However in spite of these two critical remarks I consider this film one of the best I have seen in recent years. It is sincere, touching and carries so many valuable messages without being pathetic or tear-jerker. A great film with a big hearth."
" Inspiring story with a whiff of melodrama
",0.4215,0.9845,2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"If you are looking for a story based on real life about a cat saving an addict street musician, this might be the movie for you. Ad addicts life has been told millions of times but this movie captures the ups and down without emphasizing too much of the highly dramatic struggles like withdrawals. It shows that life is full of struggles no matter who you are or even what you are :)Screenplay, directing and editing was on point. I don't think there was one scene which was out of place or boring. Lead actor was a great choice as well as the supporting cast. Of course Bob did a great job too :)If you are looking for a realistic story this might be the one for you. Trust me you will feel inspired, hopeful, and happy after watching it."

Bod and James are so cute together and the connection between them is truly moving---they both helped each other go through difficult times: James gave Bod a home and Bod helped James get cleaned.On top of the heart-taking story, the movie makes me realize how hard life can be to homeless people, addicts and street artists...I will start giving more when hearing a beautiful song on the street or seeing homeless people on a cold night."

" Surprisingly real story.
",0.296,0.8202,2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"I just watched this movie in the cinema and this review is from a fresh perspective. The story presented to us is refreshingly straight forward in its approach. The main lead does a great job in portraying a realistic picture of an addict. He really holds this movie together and that is a good thing for this is not a ""cute cat movie"". Even though the cat is cute and it does get screen time the writers and directors does not forget that this is the story of James Bowen's struggle to get off the streets and beat his addiction and the movie is better off for it. The movie is almost for short for us too see all the main actors work as a movie is not enough time to show the struggle of addiction but the actor shows the different stages well.The movie itself is shot in a close personal style which suits it well since the characters and personal relationships James develops are based on real life and there is no exaggerated drama here. In fact the realistic tone makes this movie stand out among all the other movies about life on the street, who either either try to push a set of politics or glorify substance abuse and living on the edge of society. James have to eat out of garbage cans, regular people treat him like an annoyance and thugs and goons pick on him. I expected a sappy feel good story with an Hollywood ending but instead we got an down to earth movie where even success brings some melancholy of the years lost and personal relationships gone wrong. It is based on a real life story though so the movie does not become unnecessary dark either. A real life story held together by great actors, crisp story and a personal sense of directing."
" Unforgettable - 5 PAWS UP!!!!
",0.0,0.9896,2017-02-03 00:00:00,10,"I had to give this 10 stars, which I don't think I have done on this site. This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen, but not without grit. It is not easy to watch at first, as we watch James struggle with homelessness and addiction. But like most cat's - they tend to find us, rather than the other way around. This movie was based on the true story, which makes it even more emotionally raw. Tip: do not miss the closing credits, where you will see snapshots of the real James with Bob (Bob plays himself in the movie, however). He meets human companions along his healing process as well, but it never gets overly romantic (which is a good thing). It stays true through the entire movie. Fantastic soundtrack, by the way. This movie is about never losing hope and unexpected help from the kindness of people and animals you may meet along the way. It is about realizing that some people have zero support in their lives - not even the love of family, at times. However, support can come from so many humans if we are willing to put ourselves out there. Oh yeah - animals, too :-)"
" Simple and touching
",0.0,0.9934,2017-02-02 00:00:00,8,"First, I was charmed by my favorite places in London - Covent Garden, Angel, Islington, channels... I felt like I transferred from my room in Ukraine to London streets, to its atmosphere. The movie started a bit slow and was really waiting for appearance of the cat. Which was not a disappointment. He is immensely cute. Then, I was greatly charmed by the warm synergy between Bob and James... It's a movie about kindness, about taking care and seeing beauty in small things... and that we should probably be more grateful to what we have... This isn't much a comedy, as it suggests. It's more a simple story about real life, about struggles and wins. I wish people were more kind to each other, then we would see more happy people on earth:)... Watch this movie if you want something meaningful and pleasant. I was falling asleep with smile after watching it:)"
" The best cat movie ever
",0.6369,0.9821,2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"This film was very extraordinary and even though for some critics this movie won't be seen like that,for me was really emotional,the story was really great and even though I didn't read the book I'm sure that the movie is very close to the book and it showed us what an animal can change our life,how he can make our day's happier and in this case,the street cat named Bob helped James Bowen to get rid of the drugs,offered him the taste of a true life,a happier one among Bob. For me this movie wasn't just like the other cat movies I've seen,this movie was based on a true story who showed us that thanks to an animal the life of an drug addict can change,that a street cat make that man to get rid of his drug problems and offer him a new life.Agai an great movie and I would definitely recommend it because despite the few bad critics this movie would have because in the eyes of the critics this movie wouldn't be considered to great,for me it was really emotional and it was really great."
" Loved every minute of it - must see not only for cat lovers
",0.8074,0.9948,2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"It's been a while I've been to the movies since I'm not a fan of comic book adaptions and stereotype action movies that dominate the movie market. But this movie really caught my attention not only because I'm a cat fan. I wasn't familiar with Roger Spottiswoode's earlier work like James Bond's Tomorrow Never Dies. But he did a brilliant job of portraying Bob, the main character, giving him enough screen time and partly filming from Bob's animal perspective. There are many, very funny moments - Bob's encounter with other animals and very touching scenes when Bob is interacting with James. Many movies featuring cats are stereotype Hollywood productions for kids. This movie is different - firstly because it's very authentic with an indie touch. Shot in the very places in London, in which James Bowen, the author of the adapted novel, lived and busked The soundtrack consists of busking songs performed by Luke Treadaway that were written for the movie - but that could easily have been songs performed by the real James Bowen (although I read he did a lot of Oasis and Johnny Cash covers). Secondly because the movie doesn't shy away from showing the bleak life of drug addicts. There are various scenes that show the vicious cycle of poverty, homelessness, addiction and despair. Especially in the beginning of the movie, James seems to be ""invisible""- despised by most of the people he meets and even by his father. Things start to get better after James meets a stray ginger tomcat - Bob. Bob and James become an inseparable team and the formerly ""invisible"" James, reenters the ordinary world. They busk and sell The Big Issue and finally manage to get a book deal.Although there were seven cats in the movie, the real Bob actually appears in the scenes when Bob is standing on James' shoulders or doing the high five trick. Even the real life James Bowen is getting his deserved cameo.Luke Treadaway's delivered a great performance - conveying the torment and desperation of his character brilliantly. I also liked Ruta Gedmintas character - her authentic reaction when she finds out that James is a recovering drug addict. It's a truly magical story about how love, hope and companionship can save a life - James' life. It's very touching and a perfectly done movie and I hope a sequel is in the pipeline. 10/10Would I buy the Bluray?: Yes."
" Love Cats Yes .... This Movie, Not So Much...
",0.7845,0.9489,2017-01-19 00:00:00,6,"I am a cat person -- WHICH IS BY THE WAY THE REAL EXPLANATION FOR WHY THIS TRUE STORY HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE -- and for me the film was mainly getting to spend quality time with Bob the Cat and not much else.My notes:1. Bob did a great job. He seemed sincere and authentic as a cat, what some reviewers might call a ""natural"" and hit his marks and nailed his cues.2. The rest of the film ... not so much. Other critics have noted the material was ""thin"" for a 90 minute film. This is compounded by the fact that the tone was highly sterilized, clearly intending the movie for the TV ""after school"" or Lifetime crowd. At no point does the story rise above the level you would expect from a Disney product aimed at pre-teens.Hopefully Bob's agent will find him better roles in the future. Hopefully he will continue to play a cat and not stretch himself too thin.Wish I could say the same for the rest of the cast and the production team."
" Emotional, Suspenseful and Thought Provoking
",-0.0516,0.9895,2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"A Street Cat Named Bob was a surprise for me. I think Roger Spottiswoode's extensive directing experience and meticulous casting make this work by never relenting intensity. I don't think there could have been a better casted lead; Luke Treadaway is brilliant but more important, believable. His singing, real or sync'd, is just stellar and heartfelt. Joanne Froggatt also adds realism but Betty, Ruta Gedmintas, is probably a bit too good looking for the overall feel of the film but she's great nevertheless. Sure, it's yet another down-on-their-luck story but, being closely based on true events, I found it gripping and real with dialogue that's cinematic but believable. There are moments in the film where my disbelief was certainly suspended.If you are an animal person, the film may be even more rewarding."
" Best
",0.6369,0.9931,2017-01-10 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I've ever seen! For sure the best true-story-movie involving an animal.For anyone that likes movies based on facts OR that contains our fellow friends - the cats - this is a CAN'T MISS IT movie.It shows how true friendship - which doesn't have to involve just humans - can save a man's life, even in it's darkest hours, when there seems to be no way out! Bob, the cat, saved James by becoming his best friend (like a true guardian angel).Also the way the movie is made makes you feel it is a true story. Not like many other films that make you get the feeling that we're talking about a fairy tale. Not here.The ""real"" James cameo is also great. Would be good to see it more often on the big screen (as well as Bob)So, if you like this kind of movies, See it! You won't regret!"
