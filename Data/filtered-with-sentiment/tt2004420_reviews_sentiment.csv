",0.0,0.5482,2021-03-21 00:00:00,6,"Pretty much spoiled most of the enjoyment for me. It's pretty funny at times, while unrealistic, but her acting and attempt at comedy are so cringey. She's not cool and she's not likable. I had to review this movie based purely on her acting. She ruins all the scenes she's in."

" Very funny movie...
",0.4927,0.9927,2021-03-09 00:00:00,6,"""Neighbors"" is a Comedy movie in which we watch a couple with their newborn baby moving into their new house that is next to a fraternity house. They have to deal with many difficulties, such as noise, and they have to solve this huge problem as soon as possible.I found this movie very funny and despite its simple plot it was simply amazing. It consisted of many hilarious scenes that made even better. The direction which was made by Nicholas Stoller was very good and he presented very well his main characters along with their personal stories. The interpretations of Seth Rogen who played as Mac Radner, Rose Byrne who played as Kelly Radner and Zac Efron who played as Teddy Sanders were very good and the characters connected really good between them and the plot. To sum up, I have to say that ""Neighbors"" is a nice and very funny comedy movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because it will make laugh a lot."

" A Most Underrated and Misunderstood Comedy- Byrne and Efron shine
",-0.0422,0.9958,2020-08-27 00:00:00,10,"Hilarious, profane, and by all means inappropriate- many may miss the point of this fast paced college comedy- but to all those who find the humor funny, it's an absolute blast. First off, I want to talk about the casting of this film, which is on point. So many comedies have great leads and big named actors attached to them, but few make as good use of them as this one does. I have never been a huge fan of Zac Efron or Rose Byrne, but after watching this film, I have come to love their performances here. Efron plays his role as the antagonist with great taste, and Byrne plays more than just a damsel or angry mother, and seems like a far more rounded character than most comedies are willing to put the time into. Rogen is good as always, providing many clever gags, and hilarious lines, as well as Dave Franco moving from his high school role in 21 Jump Street to this college centered flick. As for the flaws of this film, I did feel one scene was a bit out of place, and kinda flawed the overall tone of the film. I won't go into specifics, but to those who watch and pay attention, you'll find it. I also did feel a couple of transitions were a bit choppy, and didn't seem as clean as they could have been, as if they ran out of time and/or money to truly put their all into the editing process for the film. In the end though, Neighbors was an absolutely hilarious and well cast comedy that I wouldn't mind watching again sometime.
My Rating: 9.5/10"
" Hit or Miss Comedy
",0.2263,0.9759,2020-07-01 00:00:00,4,"This comedy is 100% hit or miss. You'll either love it or hate it, some fans of this ""ha ha f word= funny"" or the ""sex joke=comedy"" will most likely enjoy themselves. I'm not a huge fan of this Judd Apatow/raunchy style, but some I do like, King Of Staten Island, Superbad or TED for examples. I feel like this film just really tries to be dirty and vulgar but it doesn't work. Positives I found with the film were the talented cast, who were good being as they had a pretty bad script. I still laughed a bit at times. The only reason it's 4 stars is because I laughed out loud a couple of times near the start, and I really thought the movie would keep this going, but it didn't. But oh well a laugh is a laugh so I have to give the credit. I'll have to admit when I went on the review page and saw all the one star reviews I was shocked. But it goes to show that Seth really needs to put that wit he used in Superbad again, not just throw in some random disgusting stuff and think people will always laugh their asses off at it. I won't criticize it's fairly simple plot, because comedies aren't known for complicated stories, it's more about their executions. And this executed quite poorly. I'll end my review here and put up my useless grading and dumb verdict.
verdict: Lack of good laughs and a bombardment of dumb humor trying too hard. Bad Neighbors gets a bad grade. Grade: D"
" Great comedy
",0.765,0.9891,2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Bad Neighbours is a great comedy that explores an interesting premise extremely effectively, even if a few jokes don't land. Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron are all great. Ike Barinholtz and Dave Franco are really good. The majority of the jokes are funny and at certain points hilarious. Nicholas Stoller's direction is great and its extremely well filmed. It's also well paced and the soundtrack is really good."
" Another Mediocre Outing From Rogen and the Gang
",0.0,0.9932,2020-04-09 00:00:00,5,"Neighbors, directed by Nicholas Stoller, is a 2014 comedy starring Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron. The film follows a couple with a newborn baby taking drastic measures to evict a fraternity that just moved in next to them. Neighbours was met with pleasant critical and audience reception, so back in 2014 I was somewhat anticipating the film, however once I finally saw it I was left wanting a bit more, and after seeing again a couple years later the feeling still remained.Now starting off with the good, I like the concept for the film, it's something that (sure has been done before) can present some funny antics and although I don't feel like they were always capitalized upon, the film still did have some memorable sequences. A large part of that is thanks to set design and cinematography, though this film does feature the cliche 2010's comedy colour pallet of really bright colours, I felt this film used it to its advantaged and had moments that I would not expect in a summertime comedy flick, such as the moment where Zac Efron's character, Teddy, begins to lose his mind. The use of dutch angles and strobe lights during this scene is something that'll stick with me, making me associate that scene with the film for a very long time. Speaking of Teddy, Zac Efron, is probably the best part of the film. This is seemingly one of his most dramatic roles despite it being a comedy, his character goes through a range of emotions throughout the film and I thought he played his part well. Even though his character arc may be a little cliche, it did go some places I did not expect for this type of movie.I'm not going to pretend this film is some masterclass comedy with deep themes, as a majority of it remains very forgettable. It doesn't push any boundaries that makes the film feel memorable outside of the aforementioned Teddy. There's many jokes that don't land, most of the time feeling lazy, like ""boy, isn't it tough being a parent, we can't do the stuff we used to do anymore"", I suppose a handful of new parents or millennials could find this funny. Speaking of millennials I should mention that I kind of liked how they juxtaposed older people born in that generation (i.e. Rose Bryne and Seth Rogen's characters) against the ones born later (the fraternity), but outside of the surface level comparison there's not much more that was done with that theme.By far my biggest complaint with the film had to be, the filmmakers not knowing whether to make something based in reality, or something that is outrageous. Instead the final package is sort of an ""in-between"", and doesn't know what it wants to be. The film will feature something realistic, such as consequences the characters could face, but then the next scene is completely over-the-top, and left me with a feeling of uncertainly as to what this type of comedy it wants to be taken as. That is one of my biggest issues with most mainstream/Seth Rogen comedies, and why I find them to be very average. Either be completely absurdist like a This is the End or The Jump Street movies, or stick with an authentic mood like a St. Vincent. Pick a tone, and stand firm with it, don't try and be a middle man trying to juggle both, as it rarely succeeds.Overall, Neighbors, was a very average comedy that will probably get lost amongst the midst of other forgettable 2010 comedies. Despite having a concept that could've been funny, it just didn't capitalize on it. I'm sure there's people out there who will get enjoyment out of this film, however it is something that just didn't work for me, and for that reason I'm giving Neighbors a 5/10."

I wish I could give this negative stars for how simple minded and non-clever any of the ""jokes"" are and how degrating the movie is to.women..are you serious hollywood and rose byrne? What a waste of time. NONE of the characters are likable NONE of the acting is good & NONE of the movie made any sense.
Why didn't the neighbors put up a fence and trees ? Instead they pay a kid 1000k to wear spy glasses? Laughable. Why do the parents have no common sense about their baby or life in general yet they were going to take a baby to a rave? How.is that funny? And the baby watching them have sex? Unrelatable. Why didnt the mother understand breastfeeding after her baby is like 9 months.. By 2 months all mothers know what they are doing... Immature men in Hollywood directing this pathetic film...

When a frat house moves in next door lead by Teddy Sander (Zac Efron), their delusion is challenged as the film breaks down into our couple attempting to sabotage the overly noisy frat house, the one that invented toga parties and beer pong.The humor for the most part was low brow ,crude, and juvenile. It was predictable humor which translates into unfunny. The swearing and drug use was forced and unnatural. This is a me-too crude comedy that failed to stay above the water of a flooded basement.Zac takes his shirt off, a plus for the ladies, but they must sit through Seth showing off his mammoth butt during a sex scene."

In this movie Seth plays a new dad who is trying to be cool for the new neighbors which is a frat house. As everyone know Seth likes to smoke pot in all of his movies this one is no exception he likes pot, just because he is a dad doesn't mean he shouldn't smoke weed.

Soon, a College Fraternity moves in next-door led by it's President, Teddy (Efron) and things get out of control. When Mac and Kelly get fed up with their ruckus and call the police, Teddy decides to get even. Mac and Kelly fight back trying to get him in trouble and out of the neighborhood. This isn't bad, Rogan is great as usual and he & Byrne have good chemistry. I recommend checking this out at least once."
" Bad Neighbours is your standard American comedy filled with drugs, sex and alcohol.
",-0.25,0.9945,2018-02-25 00:00:00,6,"Add a fraternity lead by a hot guy, an Australian hormonal mother and a chubby wannabe-hipster father. What do you get? Bad Neighbours. The old peace seekers versus the young noisy hooligans. Standard formula is standard. That is literally the plot. Yet, this allows creativity and innovation to be injected into the film to bring out the hilarity. Surprisingly, this has several funny moments (even after the nth viewing). Ranging from Robert De Niro impression parties (""are you talkin' to me?""), weird hazing sessions and a dance off to the background music of Flo Rida. Random, but somehow oddly amusing that does conjure up a few laughs. Some of the jokes are high on the profanity level and does tend to feel like a competition to see how much the film can gross you out. Grows tiresome unfortunately. Acting all round was functional. Zac Efron has come along way since High School Musical and luckily has good comedic timing. Sure he looks fantastic...heavenly...I would even say Godly, but he can act. Seth Rogen is Seth Rogen. Rose Byrne pulls in a more natural performance and is a personal favourite of mine. Aside from that, it never pushes itself to more than just a crude comedy. If you like that, then great. I however like wit and subtle humour. That's not to say I didn't enjoy this, in fact in terms of recent comedies this is ranked highly. Also, the air bag scenes had horrendous human CGI that just detracted from everything else. If you couldn't do it without CGI, don't do it at all...especially in a comedy like this that utilises many props to give that sense of authenticity. Slight nitpicks but they do amount to negatives towards the film. It's undeniably watchable and a good comedy, but its contents grows tiresome as the runtime goes on."
" Very fun Seth Rogen comedy
",0.7264,0.9962,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Bad Neighbours' is a really enjoyable and well-made comedy. Plenty of laughs throughout, with a great cast and decent ending. Rogen plays his usual loveable buffoon and Byrne is surprisingly good as his wife, as she's allowed to keep her Aussie accent, rather than doing a fake American one. But the way they act together, with their cute baby, is quite realistic and charming. The whole plot is really simple - a frat moves in, they don't like it, so a battle to get rid of them escalates.There's an excellent support cast - Hannibal Buress as the cop (particularly the Garfield bit), Lisa Kudrow as the Dean & Jason Mantzoukas as the doctor all have some great lines. There's some drawn-out fraternity/party scenes, but overall it's well-paced, with constant jokes and funny moments throughout. Even the baby gets a few laughs, particularly during the calendar shoot!Efron & (the younger) Franco do a good job as the frat-boys, but it's pretty predictable - except for some of the pranks (& fights) they pull, which have heaps of laughs. It's probably not as good as 'Old School', but still better than some of Rogen's recent comedies."
" Okay...why the bad reviews?
",-0.5423,0.9666,2017-12-20 00:00:00,5,"I have been going through the User Reviews and all I see are 1s and 2s...and it's honestly a mystery to me. I feel like the reviews are just a bunch of parents in their 30s to mid 40s that thought the movie was about acting more mature and to not have fun. No, the message was that being a parent doesn't have to keep you from having fun from time to time, but always be sure it's at the right time. They became cool with each other in the end, if you just watched it and didn't leave the theater immediately, and ran home to write a review. And a bunch of other people said that the movie was ""vulgar and brainless"", which shows me enough that people don't into movies as much as they should, in fact, I don't think people look into these kinds of movies at all. Yes, I understand that this movie has a lot of drug use and profanity, and there is a good amount of crude humor with sexual content and graphic nudity, but that doesn't really make the movie completely vulgar. This movie had a lot behind that adults need to understand. Plus, not to mention, it was a movie about frat boys living next door, were you expecting this movie's humor to be pleasant? I honestly thought this movie was fairly funny, especially the airbag scenes, and even if it wasn't, I'd still enjoy it, because it lets you know that you can still have fun from time to time, and nothing will keep you from doing that for a long time. You have to look into a movie more before you review it."

" Very funny movie!
",0.54,0.998,2017-04-13 00:00:00,9,"The reviews are correct about this film. Neighbors is a very funny movie, almost every single joke in the movie works so well, and that hardly ever happens in a mainstream comedy movie. The casting is perfect, and I thought that all the actors nailed their roles. Zac Efron is the perfect choice for the beer can crushing typical frat guy. He has that believable college party dude essence about him. And he doesn't look too bad either. This quote in the beginning of the film is very true. ""He looks like something a gay guy created in a laboratory!"" And as a gay guy I can say that yes that's very true lol. Seth Rogen is a great comedic actor and he does well as the new father who still wants to live out his younger days and becomes obsessed with battling the next door fraternity. And I absolutely love Rose Byrne as Seth Rogen's husband, she is very funny and delivers the lines near perfectly. And omg Lisa Kudrow (Friends) has a small role as dean of the university the fraternity is associated with. She is hilarious as usual, one of my favorite actors ever! The comedy works very very well, this is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen actually. I really suggest that if you're looking for a great well made comedy then I 100% suggest Neighbors! I can't wait to see Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising. You even get to see Dave Franco's naked a**! That's just the delicious icing on the cake lol. 9/10 overall."

When a frat house gang led by Teddy (Zac Efron) moves into the house next door, a chain of one-upmanship hilarity begins in the ""battle for the neighborhood"".Simply put, what makes this movie funny is Seth Rogen. The guy plays the same character in practically every movie he's ever been in (or at least that I've seen!), yet it continues to work because it is so relatable. He's the slightly-pudgy ""average joe"" who has the perfect one-liners and sly comments that we all wish we could come up with on a daily basis! Without his unique brand of humor, this would be a ""lost ship"" of a film.Basically, if you've seen ""Knocked Up"" and enjoyed it, watch this one too and expect similar results. It's the same type of schtick, only with Rogen playing a slightly more mature version of his role in that earlier film. If you don't like crude (often extremely so) humor and hundreds of pot jokes, then stay away.""Neighbors"" gave me some good laughs in the theater and took my mind off the everyday grind for an hour and forty minutes. If you aren't expecting anything more than that, you'll enjoy it."
" Bad Neighbors
",-0.5423,0.3866,2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"This movie is just... hard to describe.I've watched this movie because I remember when it first come out, there was a lot of advertisement around it, the story line looked promising, good ground to make us laugh. And now there's a ""Neighbors 2"", so it must be good right?Well, unfortunately no. I should have come to IMDb before watch this movie, because it's simply not a good movie.The jokes, incredibly lame. Not a moment of laugh.... simply silence throughout the movie. Then, the movie takes a bad turn: suddenly, the frat boy should be worried about his future, in a less-than-2-minute-scene.... Why include that?And finally, the end of the movie it's just bad, because it falls to address another question of the movie: was he able to fill the board with a picture? I think they didn't close that string. I mean, i like the fact that it doesn't finish the way you think it will (framing a picture on the Delta Psy board) but either way, they should close that ""loop"".Please, before watching this movie, read some review here on IMDb, and after that decide if it's worth it."
