" Such a downgrade
",0.0,-0.8679,2021-03-21 00:00:00,4,Unfortunately X-Men fail this time after hitting an all time high with the previous movie. The story of Apocalypse is told in such a disappointing fashion. Not worth watching.
" Apocalypse
",0.0,0.9205,2021-03-09 00:00:00,6,"Review By Kamal KI thought this movie was pretty decent. Even though Jennifer Lawrence plays Mystique pretty bland, her arc is still pretty interesting. Raven never really accepted herself, but now people are looking up to her. Magneto's story was really heartbreaking and if it weren't for Apocalypse, his family still would've been alive. Professor X, Beast, Havok, and Moira all return from First Class, and they were pretty interesting (R.I.P. Havok).
I personally think that they definitely needed to develop the younger X-Men a lot more than they really did, but I did like the scenes they were all in. They really should have kept the mall scenes. Cyclops wasn't the most interesting character, but his reaction to Havok's death was really sad. They set up the Phoenix Force for Jean, and she had a nice little connection with Professor X that nobody else had. Nightcrawler was great, and even though we didn't really get that much of him the movie, he's still my favorite character. Quicksilver was great as usual, and his heroic scene in the movie gave me chills, but I'm still extremely mad he didn't tell Magneto he was his son. I didn't connect with Storm whatsoever and I just thought her character was completely dull.
Apocalypse himself was just a lame villain and he was defeated way too easily. I also thought the Stryker storyline was pretty dumb and I was confused by whether I was watching Apocalypse or an X2 remake. They could've cut it all out and had more development for the younger characters."

",0.0,-0.3658,2021-02-16 00:00:00,2,"Don't bother watching this movie. It's predictable, boring, and nothing interesting about it"
" Not the best but certainly not the worst
",0.7474,-0.8884,2021-02-11 00:00:00,7,"On the surface, the plot is pretty standard. Bad guy, Apocalypse, who is considered the world's original mutant, wakes up on the wrong side of the bed and decides the world needs to be cleansed. He recruits 4 mutants (Storm, Psylock, Magneto and Angel) to assist him. Standing in his way is the young X-Men, led by Charles Xavier and Mystique.This was a really good movie in its own right. There was plenty of action, and loads of superheroes showing off their cool powers. It was enjoyable to see some of the well known characters, such as Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm in their younger days, before they are fully in control of their powers. I also really liked Quicksilver who, for the second movie in a row, arguably stole the show. However the movie had an overly typical plot, which failed to give anything new to the superhero genre. There were too many underdeveloped characters lumped into an overly long movie. The movie was enjoyable but was massively confusing and annoying due to the continuity problems. I really struggled to get my head around the timeline which was unfortunately a distraction.All in all I think X-Men: Apocalypse It's certainly not one of the best in the series, but it's also by no means one of the worst."
" Isaac sinks the film along with some subpar writing.
",0.0,0.8085,2021-02-03 00:00:00,4,The script could have used another rewrite to make Apocalypse more of an engaging character and to streamline the plotting a little bit. But the main issue is Isaac is mostly funny and borderline parody as the Big Bad here. Isaac decides to use a voice reminiscent of Vito in Godfather part 1. (I guess because the character is the Godfather of mutants?) I don't know if he was trying to do an impression or what but the choice renders the film very silly and stakes free.
" X-Men: Apocalypse 2016 Review
",0.0,0.9947,2021-01-26 00:00:00,6,"God damn I love me some Nightcrawler. Kodi Smit-McPhee does an amazing job in my opinion, but maybe i'm biased. Evan Peters also does a stellar job with Quicksilver and is honestly becoming one of my favorite characters in the entire franchise. And the final actors i'll give praise to is McAvoy who steps up his performance in every film, it's just a joy to see him, and also Michael Fassbender who has his best performance yet - making me finally love his character.
This film surprisingly has some decent humor in it (mostly with Quicksilver and Nightcrawler) which is a complete turn from the previous X-Men installments and a welcome inclusion.
Where X-Men: Apocalypse falls off is definitely it's corny storytelling and lackluster villain. Oscar Isaac does a good job with Apocalypse, but his character never landed with me in that I never felt anything towards the character. And the storytelling, it's uh .. okay? Personally I found it to be a bit corny and cliché especially with some of the Mutants actions in the final act. CGI and green screening also felt off and looked pretty cheap at points especially for a 2016 movie.(there's also some really obvious product placements all throughout this film that we're getting quite annoying)"

" Confused nonsensical narrative
",-0.3182,0.8149,2021-01-14 00:00:00,2,"I honestly couldn't make head or tail of this film. Yes, the special effects are pretty good but the narrative is just nonsense. Yes, it's a superhero movie and I was willing to suspend my disbelief but this is just bewildering. I had no sympathy for any of the characters. Shame really as I generally like the Marvel franchise."
" Typical 21st century movie. Completley forgettable
",0.0,-0.98,2020-12-12 00:00:00,3,"SPOILER...This movie is boring.I've seen worse.
Much much much worse.
But this is definitely one of the worst big budget movies I've seen.
Rose Byrne. Ugh. Why is she in so many movies ..that indicates she's...good?
I don't get it. Much prefer her almost husband Bobby Canavale. Why couldn't he have been in this? She's terrible.This is the 2nd time I've watched this movie...mainly bc I didn't realize I'd seen it already and thought I was watching something I had not seen before.
All these movies are essentially the same...doesn't really matter what the title or plot is.
They are all the same...some better, some worse...but basically the same.
How was your Subway sandwich? Ummm...a subway sandwich. Essentially the same sandwich every time.And speaking of over rated...oh good. Jennifer Lawrence is in this too.
Ha. And sure...why not shove what's her name...Olivia Munn...down everybody's throat.And you're telling me Sophie Turner isn't one of Meryl Streep's kids? Ok.Ok.. the main bad guy and his powers...he's bad ass...for the first half of the movie or so
Just show him doing stuff for 2 hours. A plot is unnecessary and merely a waste of time.Movie is so boring between the action...no wonder I forgot that I had already seen it.The song playing in my mind as I watch this....
Been all around the world...it's the same song...it's just the same old song....
Boring

Oh...here's some action.

",0.0,-0.957,2020-11-18 00:00:00,3,"Apocalypse is just a slog. It has some cool action, some good performances (James mcavoy, even peters, and especially Michael fassbender) and magneto is interesting but the rest is forgettable with shockingly bad effects, a story with tons of logic flaws, a boring and forgettable villian (a waste of Oscar issac), Jennifer Lawrence not caring at all an phoning it in, a Stryker subplot that is pointless, apocalypse's powers are inconsistent as all hell, waste of some great x-men characters, and just feels like it's going through the motions. Skip this on entirely it's easily the 4th worst x-men movie"
" Although not as good as the previous film, it is an excellent film nonetheless.
",0.3169,0.9968,2020-10-17 00:00:00,8,"I am not very used to films that have characters from the comic book universe as their theme, but the quality and impact that some have had makes them a mandatory visit. So, even without knowing much about the characters or their fictional stories, I decided to watch the X-Men franchise films. This decision was followed by some reading about characters and films. I tried to follow more or less the chronological sequence of events, starting with the prequels.This film follows the events of ""Days of Future Past"" and places the world again on the verge of an apocalypse when a millennial mutant wakes up from his sleep and decides to take the world for himself, and for a group of highly talented mutants that he will recruit.Directed by Bryan Singer, it's a film that is not as good as the previous one, although it has a lot of good points. Critically edited, the film has a pleasant rhythm and has no dead moments but lost some quality by its average script, which starts from a good idea and fails to develop it. The connection to Ancient Egypt seems like an original and appealing way of introducing the story. Initially, I thought it sounded a little forced and out of place, but it ended up fitting in and making sense, in addition to allowing us an extraordinary opening scene, the most impactful of the franchise so far. The film has some memorable scenes, such as the rescue of the mansion's students while it explodes or the moment when Magneto confronts his childhood and devastates the concentration camp where he was imprisoned, but it also has badly used romantic sub-plots, almost forgotten amidst the action, and uninteresting humorous moments.The cast is massively inherited from previous films and is composed of great actors, however it is easily felt that there are actors with very little to do and a lack of commitment and depth in the construction of the characters (probably due to the material given to the cast). The protagonist is the duo James McAvoy / Michael Fassbender and both actors shone. Sophie Turner, who gave life to Jean Gray, also had space and material to show her talent and Evan Peters revealed true charisma and brilliance. Hugh Jackman has a very brief appearance that links this film to his character's personal life story. Oscar Isaac gave life to the villain, a super-powerful millennial mutant committed to wiping out Humanity, but I didn't like what I saw: he is a really fearsome being, but he has a way of speaking and acting so affected that he seems overly artificial and theatrical. Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne, Ben Hardy, Alexandra Shipp, Olivia Munn, Lana Condor, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Lucas Till also appear in this film, but they have almost nothing to do and their roles are very limited. Jennifer Lawrence also seems to be left, not knowing what to do with her character, now that she has moved to the ""good guys"" side.In addition to these merits, the film has excellent production values that should be highlighted. It is a Marvel film and there are huge millions of dollars involved, which is quite evident from the beginning. Visually it is a show in itself, with a very well thought out and conceived cinematography, in addition to great visual effects and the best CGI that money could buy. The scenes and action sequences are great and the effects are a bonus. As happened almost always in this franchise, the film has excellent scenarios and costumes, although I must advise everyone that the scenes related to Ancient Egypt are totally creative and there is not really an effort of historical rigor. I think it is fair to also greet the makeup department and the great soundtrack by John Ottman."
" Watchable
",0.0,-0.7184,2020-10-13 00:00:00,6,It is a good film but has a slow screenplay which makes parts of the film boring. Watch if you are a die hard X-men fan.

" Not bad but here's the thing...
",0.2323,-0.8521,2020-08-27 00:00:00,7,"When the fuq is Bryan Singer going to open an X-Men comic book and make the damn movie look like the panels? Make it more colorful and much sexier...and while we're on the topic...(please dont hate me just finish reading) Olivia Munn is barely attractive and not even remotely hot enough to play Psylocke. It would be one thing if they conpromised looks for talent, but she isnt a good actor either. Psylocke is the pinnacle of hot chicks in comics and Olivia has short stumpy calves attached to bulky gapless thighs and hips that look like square blocks, complete with no butt. Im not body shaming at all, its exactly the same as if i thought i could play Thor, i cant for obvious reasons. So its obvious that either a gay person or virulent feminist casted the movie and angrily decided for the world that Olivia Munn was ""perfect"" as those types of people always say about the imperfect."
" Came for X-Men action and lore/ left with Psylocke crush
",-0.1531,0.8316,2020-08-13 00:00:00,6,"Not gonna lie.
Psylocke was my absolute favorite part in this film.
She looked amazing with her abilities."
" What a bore
",-0.25,-0.264,2020-08-05 00:00:00,5,"This is a strange film that really lets down the standard set by its predecessors, Days of Future Past and First Class. Apocalypse is a rather bland and overpowered villain with an uninteresting motivation. What exactly is his appeal? The story and emotions seem contrived and unconvincing. There's also a plot hole introduced here - where was Apocalypse during the original timeline before the time travel of Days of Future Past?"
" Sorry its FLAWLESS!! Incredible action movie!!

Has it all great story, acting,direction,villains, and phenomenal special effects. Opens with a bang and never let's up, as an extra some amazing 3d!! A must OWN movie."
" Singer did a great job
",0.6249,0.7184,2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,"Alright you nay sayers let me break it down for you. Given the run time of the film this was a greatly produced movie. Not only did it introduce several key members of the franchise, it gave a brief back story if these characters. Please go back to the comic books if you want a full bio of wolverine, storm, Jean gray, Scott, etc. This movie was about apocalypse and the four horsemen which is one of many arcs in the marvel universe, while the attention nah I say lime light was on him it did loosely follow the comic book multi series event on it. You cant not expect a 4 hour movie on this massive story arc."
" Very entertaining !
",0.54,0.7772,2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,"I was hooked from start to finish !Character development could have been a little more consistent, but when you throw in the amazing CGI and a bunch of new characters it evens the balance!"
" Enjoyable
",0.4404,0.9325,2020-07-12 00:00:00,7,"Apocalypse is not the best x-men Movie. Specially the villain is a bit weird and ridiculous to me. But it's still very enjoyable mainly because of the great performance of James mc avoy and Michael fassbender. They are just fantastic in their roles again, specially James. So it's definetly worth to watch"
" Same old, same old, and it's really getting old at this point
",0.0,-0.9897,2020-07-11 00:00:00,3,"It's a shame that, after Days of Future Past actually wiped the slate clean and gave the studio the freedom to do something new and different with the X-Men franchise, they instead gave the reins back to Bryan Singer and made one of the same old movies all over again. X-Men: Apocalypse is a mess of a film that tries to do way too much, and does none of it well. One of the things that has always been a problem with this franchise is that they have too many characters to work with, and it is hard to flesh out all these characters in a matter of two hours. So the best X-Men movies are the ones where they select a small subset of the cast and make it their story, while only showing the other characters on the fringe of the action. This film tries that, but chooses too many characters, and it's kind of tedious because they choose all the same characters that were significant in every other X-Men movie. They didn't have time to deal with the Cyclops and Nightcrawler origins again, Mystique's continued distrust of humanity, Quicksilver struggling to deal with his lingering daddy issues, and the return of Stryker and the Weapon X project. I completely threw in the towel when they tipped their hand that we would see the Phoenix power from Jean Grey (a subplot they never earned the first time, and since it almost killed the franchise, you'd think they would avoid going there again this time.) It's amazing to me that, in the decades of material that they have to pull from for X-Men stories, they keep coming back to the same ones. I mean, the film ends on a direct quote of a line that Professor X already said in the first X-Men film!I'll admit that I'm a little harsher on the X-Men movies than I might be on other franchises, because I was such an avid reader of their comic books back in the 1990s. As a result, I rarely fall head-over-heels in love with any of these movies, because I find myself nitpicking them to death. But I had heard plenty of bad stuff about X-Men: Apocalypse already, so I was trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. I was even willing to ignore the weird decade-jumping that they are doing, because comics will have characters look the same age for decades, so I can laugh that off when the movies do the same. Yet, even if I don't count that as something wrong with X-Men: Apocalypse, they didn't get much right. It's a muddled mess that lacks an interesting story to tell. The villain is coming from the same basic viewpoint as Magneto has been espousing in every other film, so the conflict is no different. They introduce Psylocke, who was a favorite character of mine from the comics, and then give her nothing to do (and also completely change her powers.) Once again this movie fights to make Mystique a central character, probably because Jennifer Lawrence is in the role, and yet she looks bored by the whole thing. Not to mention how utterly out-of-place she is in these big battles, considering the limited scope of her powers. Some of the new cast is atrocious, even though the actors have been decent in other films. In every way there was simply no life and excitement to X-Men: Apocalypse. It shouldn't be this boring to watch a movie about super-powered mutants, but I was checking my watch multiple times. I could not be happier that Fox no longer has control of this franchise because they don't seem to know what to do with it."
" Best X-Men Movie (in my opinion)
",0.6369,0.8471,2020-06-27 00:00:00,9,"I would say this is the best X-Men movie, coming in just ahead of First Class.
'X-Men: Apocalypse' is the finale of the Beginnings Trilogy, and combines the best elements of both movies that came before (these being Moira MacTaggert, Major/Colonel Stryker and Quicksilver). It adds new, likeable characters who you grow to love in the original X-Men Trilogy (Scott, Jean, Storm) and closes the arcs of the centre characters from 'First Class' and 'Days of Future Past' (Charles, Mystique, Erik) in imaginative and interesting ways - the main one of these being the fact that Erik now has a family.
The one negative thing about this movie is its villain, and the character that the movie is named after - Apocalypse. Although 'Avengers: Infinity War' came out 2 years after this film, they both feature very similar antagonists. However, Thanos has an understandable motivation for the things he does. Apocalypse, sadly, does not. He just wants to destroy the 1983 world because he's not the most powerful one in it.
Overall this is a great movie and a great end to the trilogy."
" This movie is for X-Men Fans
",0.0,0.8315,2020-06-23 00:00:00,6,"X-Men: Apocalypse is a superhero movie directed by Bryan Singer and stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Oscar Isaac, Jennifer Lawrence, Rose Byrne, Nicholas Hoult, Josh Helman and Tomas Lemarquis.The movie starts on a very promising note by showing the story of an ancient powerful mutant. Magneto is living a simple family life, the new mutants are regularly introducing into the family but as soon as the first hour is over the movie start derailing from it's plot.Acting is good and strong, direction is good but the main problem is screenplay which doesn't have enough ingredients to cook the plot to it's potential. The major flaw which i felt was the end of Apocalypse whose unmatched and undefined power fizzes too soon and yes it's disappoints as there were lots of expectation from the climax.There were indeed lot's of expectation from the movie but to some extent the movie disappoints."

At this point he has nothing Left.° We Get to see the Xavier Mansion For Many Scenes and it Was Great to see the Young Mutants going to class from day to day. It was like A University with a Super Hero Twist.° Apocalypse's Motivation was on a Much Higher Level than Any of the Previous Villains. He Saw that The World built Weapons and Had Idols and Had Countries as Super Powers but He Wanted Humanity to Rely on Him. He Wanted to Be their God.° The Visuals throughout the Movie were Amazing.° The Mind Realm Scene was a Great Visual Allegory.° The Weapon X Scene Was Brutal and Great to Watch.° The Quicksilver scene was Good to See Again.A Few Bad points:° I don't Understand why Storm Turned on him° I was not convinced that Magneto would have turned on him, he had Nothing Left. Plus Magneto Already has a Tendency to Destroy the Humans anyway so that wasn't convincing at all.° The Lead Up to Jean's Full power was not built up enough.Overall, It's hard to Rank the X-Men Movies in Order because they all have Issues but This Is One of the Best X-Men films I've ever Seen."

The plot for this one wasn't exactly the best compared to, say, ""First Class,"" or ""Days of Future Past."" It's easily the weakest in this prequel trilogy, but there were still some fun moments. The '80's pop culture references were clever and the action was fun. Quicksilver is still the fun comic relief character that he was in ""Days of Future Past."" Although, they did reuse the ""he runs so fast that time stops so he messes with stuff while he does his job"" gag from ""Days of Future Past,"" and it just felt unnecessary and redundant. It was only funny the first time, guys. Sorry. Apocalypse certainly isn't the best villain this franchise has had, but he was still enjoyable. The cinematography in this was spot-on. I was excited to be introduced to some new mutants that are now on my favorites list. (Not saying who though. Spoilers). It's a good movie, but the plot could have been better thought out.

'Apocalypse' is also all over the place, with way too much going on, and definitely too CGI-heavy. The over-use of CGI removes every inch of realism (despite the film being a fantasy, off course, but I mean within the context of the genre). The most interesting scene by far was Quicksilver's rescue mission prior to a huge explosion. Very well done!Even the regular X-Men characters were not as interesting. Neither was the story. It was too formulaic and not gripping in the least. With a run time of 144 minutes (yawn) I was quite relieved when it ended. (Uhm, how did it end again? Oh well, see, its forgettable...)"

I say this because Storm gets enhanced powers from Apocalypse but she had those powers in the previous original timeline where Apocalypse never woke, so plot hole perhaps?As for the actors, I find all of them to be undesirable, especially the girl that plays gene, I liked Jenifer Lawrence in the last two movies but fell flat here and I say the same for Mcavoy and Fassbender, then there's the lame cameo from Hugh Jackman which I won't go too much into.The plot stinks and didn't make a lot of sense, It had a very The Mummy vibe."

",-0.2867,-0.9723,2019-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Enjoyed it quite a bit. Apocalypse really made me think heavily of the Stargate sci fi series. Loved that. He really nailed that holier than thou Egyptian god or Goa'uld god from Stargate feel. The guy who played Apocalypse is actually one of our best actors of this decade. He was in Ex Machina too.So I had a lot of dislike for First Class, because it was so...melodramatic...and even had a grey gloomy depressing feel to it at times. This one, Apocalypse, and Days of Future Past...these two had far more of the good stuff and far less of that lame grey stuff. You know what I mean. Those scenes where you are all like rolling your eyes and glancing at the clock wondering how long they are going to drag this boring scene out.There are times in so many of the X-men movies when it seems almost like they are trying to make a scene be from a horror movie. Not in scariness, just in pain and dread and ""oh how horrible for the character that this happened to them"". Yuck. They need to take a lesson from movies like CA The First Avenger and Infinity War. I don't know why the writers of these X-men movies so often try to put that ""dread"" feel into these films. Doesn't make sense considering that those are the worst scenes in them. I know they want us to believe that anything can happen including characters being killed off, so that we will actually worry about the characters, but they try way too hard with that doom and gloom in many X-men movies.The main reason why people hated X3 Last Stand was because of them killing off favorite characters and turning other favorite characters evil. Also that dread-atmosphere they very much over-succeeded in portraying. Plenty of critics have said they disliked it for other reasons, but I believe this was the real primary reason.Enough ranting. This movie was pretty enjoyable and one of the better of the X-men movies in my opinion."

Apocalypse was such a goodie goodie villain. I'll be dumbstruck if it touches USD 1 billion as of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Some surprises here and there, but nothing new.Single X-men character focussed movies as Wolverine, Deadpool etc., would be the only way to save X-men characters from vanishing and probably join the Avengers. And also, If these X-men characters would generate thrill and excitement, maybe just maybe, X-men movies could plan on coming back. But for now, think they should take a backseat.Peace Out!"

If I may cite the movie: ""... to break forth bloodily, then the past must be obliterated and a new start made. Let us now start fresh without remembrance, rather than live forward and backward at the same time. Now, what are the aggrieve things that the author meant when he wrote all that? That's going to be your assignment for tomorrow."" - this should be the assignment for the writers (all writers), since these words get spoken in a movie that again (beating a dead horse) feels cooerced to beat down on WW1 - and let's not forget the ""evil"" Russians again - not only blocking progression, but a means to spread hate and ignorance and xenophobia and intolerance etc - in a movie that sees itself as a pleading for tolerance for people who are different (than the average American) - failed, F, Professor X / Bryan Singer/all of Hollywood."

There is one thing can't figure out, X-Men: Days of Future Past has directed by Bryan Singer and written by Simon Kinberg. It was amazing, the best X-Men movie for me. Also X-Men: Apocalypse has directed by Bryan Singer and written by Simon Kinberg too. But these movies are so different on satisfaction. Apocalypse isn't a deep character in that movie, actually he is so cliche. Magneto's decisions, some events and some dialogues are so meaningless. The movie is not so boring at all, it has cool moments but honestly I found boring some parts. On the other hand, cast did a great job. Also musics are great too.

" Balk Like An Egyptian
",0.3612,-0.6403,2019-07-10 00:00:00,5,"Last bit of preparation ahead of ""Dark Phoenix"" and I braced myself for ""Apocalypse"" which wasn't actually as bad as I remembered, but does run ""The Last Stand"" close for worst X-Men film.An ancient mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is awakened and begins to reclaim the world that belonged to him centuries ago. His plan, and his recruitment of Magneto (Michael Fassbender) finds him opposed by Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and the students of his school for the gifted.Whilst not as bad as I remembered, ""Apocalypse"" is not good. Though it has its moments, it's all rather hamstrung by its villain - Apocalypse. He looks ridiculous, it's a very heavy makeup and prosthetics job and aside from the silliness of it, it also cuts the legs out from under any performance that Oscar Isaac is giving. His plan is not much better than his aesthetic, though initially talking about finding the four most powerful mutants as his ""horsemen"" he actually selects the first two he comes across, Magneto ( who admittedly is plausible) and Angel (who's only involvement is losing a fight to Nightcrawler earlier in the film).The movie does have another excellent Quiksilver scene, though I think I prefer the one from ""Days of Future Past"" but ultimately there's not much else to enjoy in a plodding run though a beloved X-Men Story."

I would have expected Magneto to turn because he found out he has a son, or because he still loved Mystique, but i thought it was perfect and much more moving that he turned when Charles was in danger because he was his only true friend in the world. and the phoenix rage scene gave me super goosebumps"
" A Forgettable X-Men Film
",0.0,-0.4215,2019-06-24 00:00:00,5,Although entertaining this movie just does not hold enough substance. Although I do not think it is as bad as the critics make it out to be it is kind of a mediocre film. The plot has just been done before so many times. With the high amount of superhero movies a new one has to bring something new to the table and X-Men Apocalypse just didn't do that.
" I'm with Colonel Stryker
",0.0,-0.9915,2019-06-23 00:00:00,1,"This movie sums up everything that is wrong with the X-Men universe (as far
as I understand it from the movies). Unlike the Avenger-style movies, where the
superheros are clearly dedicated to defeating unambiguously evil villains (hence, putting the *hero* in superhero), these X-Men mutants are a pretty unlikeable, angsty, and morally questionable lot.We're supposed to feel sorry for the mutants as some kind of loathed, persecuted minority group, but this has yet to be believable in any of these movies, especially this one. The mutants have *superhuman* powers, for crying out loud, how can they be afraid of or in danger from anybody? In fact, whenever there is a straightup showdown with humans, it's a complete massacre by the mutants. So, in fact, they actually are the Nietschien ubermensch who we humans deservedly should fear, and nothing they do ever disproves this.Worse, we humans are routinely, obsessively, and one-dimensionally presented as hateful, fearful, petty, and murderous caricatures. Nothing shows this better than when Magneto saves a guy's life in a steel mill, and not one - not *one*! - human thanks him, sees the goodness in the act, takes his side, etc. That is just not credible.We're supposed to feel compassion for the mutants, yet scores and eventually millions of humans are wiped out, without so much as a moment of silence. Are we supposed to somehow masochistically enjoy these revenge fantasies?
Last I checked, I'm a human being, not a mutant. Why would I side with the mutants against my own kind? Who am I supposed to root for here?There are many reasons to watch a movie, but having shame and guilt and self-loathing rubbed in your face for over two hours is not one of them."
" Milking a Franchise
",0.0,0.9841,2019-06-16 00:00:00,5,"Although i wouldn't exactly call the X-Men Universe a franchise but rather a series of unfortunate movies, it still tries to convince its audience that it is indeed relevant enough to compete with other A-list titles. The problem i have with this is that in line with competing with other studios, they no longer care about making a proper story. At this point the X-men have been milked so dry that i want to treat it like an injured horse and just shoot it in the face.Again, because this movie has such a cookie cutter formula it fails to become something noteworthy. It is now full of plot points that every other superhero movie has. A powerful villain shows up that threatens the world as we know it and in order to stop him our charismatic protagonist has to recruit other super people to help this cause. Isn't this the exact same premise for X-Men First Class? Hell it even has another tragic backstory to Magneto's character i mean christ guys give the dude a break. We've already established that his life utter garbage you don't need to another reason for him to hate humanity. And this is what i mean, its become so formulaic that the whole super heroes saving the world bit completely lost its charm at this point, its just as routine as brushong your teeth now. They failed to bring any new material that it was honestly a chore to sit through.I don't like this movie simply because they failed to deliver on being something more than just a superhero movie. Their premise was good, an almighty mutant that they had no way of beating, although it's overused, there could have been some honest potential there. Maybe have the characters go through every tactic they could find in ancient times to find a way to beat him, or maybe find some other clever way of beating him like analyzing his immortality to counteract it. Instead of course they went the ex machina way and just let another super powered individual kill him with virtually no effort just to create another cookie cutter sequel.While being formulaic isn't exactly a bad thing, this film makes it look bad. There were some instances in the film where i went ""wow"", that's cool, but that was only because they elevated it so much that it was honestly the only good thing i saw. I am obviously talking about Quicksilver's scene but that is also overused at this point. They did it the last movie and people loved it so of course theyre going to use it again.Overall the composition of the film was meh for me. The cinematography is average and didnt really try.The acting is fine i guess but none of them really felt like their characters except maybe Magneto but at this point I'm pretty sure that was only forced character development where they only killed his family in order for the audience to feel sympathy for him. In all honesty at least Fassbender was enjoyable to watch in this film. The writing was formulaic and unsatisfactory, like i said they only went the ""strong guy is killed by even stronger guy route"" so that kinda sucks. It was a dumb fun movie but i would not want to see it again. If i wanna see that Quicksilver scene i can just watch it on youtube without the hassle of sitting through the film."

" Better than most give it credit for
",0.6969,0.994,2019-05-31 00:00:00,8,"Spoilers. It was tough to follow up the fantastic X-Men Days of Future Past. But this was a pretty solid comic book action flick, flawed just like the comics, but good. I liked the introduction of Jean Grey and the villain was a credible threat. The actors did a fine job in their roles, even portraying Apocalypse and especially the main Xmen characters. The sudden ease of his defeat could have been better written though... as the Phoenix side of Jean Grey came out of nowhere too fast. It would have been better if she had more of a scene with Xavier in the mind realm or something... so that was the major downfall of this movie. If you put aside the character design of Apocalypse and the lacklustre climax, the rest of the movie is pretty solid. My favourite moments in this film actually were not so much the action moments but the character building. Few people talk about the sound design but this was one of the better SFX edits I've heard. Not a huge fan of the somewhat generic Xmen theme though, it is getting tiring... am looking very forward to the next score by Zimmer. But yeah, I didn't expect that much and was pleasantly surprised. It's an 8/10 for a comic book movie... not bad, not great, just good. I'd recommend it to Xmen fans but to non-fans I'd say sure go ahead and watch but don't expect Days of Future Past."

" Doesn't Hold Up to it's predecessor
",0.0,-0.8876,2019-05-14 00:00:00,7,"I re-watched this film today in preparation for Dark Phoenix being released next month and while it was not as good as ""Future Past,"" and there are some shortcomings, I think it still has its place in the X-Men franchise. My biggest issue with this installment is the time jump of 10 years after the events of ""Future Past"" from 1973 to 1983. While there is some appeal to seeing the characters across the decades, aside from seeing them wearing 80's attire there is no plot reason for such a time jump (aside from Magneto's family I guess). There is no attempt to make any of the characters from the prior 2 movies, (Beast, Mystique, Magneto, Prof. X, Havoc) look 10 years older. I think they don't even look any older than they did in ""First Class."" If Magneto was supposed to be at Auschwitz as a child, then why is he in his late 30's/early 40's? Even if the character was born in 1935 or so, that would make him 48 at the time of the plot in 1983. I don't think there was any reason for the jump from the 60s, to the 70s to the 80s other than to say ""hey look at these guys all wearing different clothes.The biggest complaint I've seen about this installment is that the villain, Apocalypse, is generic. I think the idea of Apocalypse as the villain was a good one, but they didn't do a good enough job establishing his motivation for why he was trying to destroy the world. The opening sequence of him in ancient Egypt where he was supposedly transferring him consciousness to a new body was really ever fully explained. I thought there could've been more to show his origins since he was the first mutant.The introduction of the Dark Phoenix character was a highlight though and now that we know that is the next film I look forward to the retelling of that story."

Apparently, this is sure-fire recruitment inducement for superhuman mutants.Meanwhile, I pity the Hank McCoy/Beast character who is either an uninteresting accountant-type character or an embarrassing, useless, big, blue lug. Numerous scenes of mass slaughter and the military literally mopping up pools of blood do nothing to improve the viewer's experience either.Otherwise, the film is over-stuffed with random CGI effects and a plethora of sidekick characters that are left awkwardly standing around.

",-0.6808,0.9936,2019-04-08 00:00:00,6,"I love x-men comics and characters and mainly have been happy with the movie franchise. I really enjoyed First Class and DOFP and so eagerly anticipated this one. Such a shame. Apocalypse is one of the most powerful villains in Marvel history but failed to deliver on screen. He was powerful but not that scary. He was too small and should have been bigger dons more intimating. Wolverine does pop up but did not really enjoy the sequence. Quicksilver is a great character and I love the guy who plays the role. In DOFP he had an awesome sequence which they repeated in Apocalypse. It was good but almost felt like a repeat. Quicksilver is ridiculously powerful in these movies and is way off. He just ain't that powerful in the comics. Jean Grey I found boring, young Scott irritating. Jennifer Lawrence is going through the motions. Again she plays a character who just isn't as key of big in the comics but is portrayed as one of the big players in the recent movies and gets way too much screen time. This is only because it is Lawrence in the role and they want to capitalise of her Hunger Games fame. She even acts like Katniss Everdeen with all the kids looking up to her like their saviour. I like the bald and wheelchaired version of Charles better. Fassbender is always great as Magneto and continues to rock the role. Storm and Psylocke were fine but we found out little about them. Angel was really lame. The action sequences were pretty awful. It wound me up when Charles said ""Goodbye old friend"" as he and Eric said goodbyes and giggled. Magneto has just caused a major global catastrophe and killed loads of innocent people but all is forgiven cos he helped out at the end. I worry about the next movie. Dark Phoenix is such a key story to the franchise and I just think Sophie Turner will struggle to pull it off. I don't like her acting, it is so dull and monotone. A real step back for the x-men series. I hope they can recover"

" A Step Backwards After The Excellent Days Of Future Past
",0.5719,0.4749,2019-03-13 00:00:00,6,"Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to X-Men Apocolypse (2016)Plot In A Paragraph: In the 1980s the X-Men must defeat an ancient all-powerful mutant, who intends to thrive through bringing destruction to the world.After two solid movies, filled with great performances, this really is a step back!! The irony is not lost when Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) ""At least we all agree the third one is the worst"" after a few of the mutants have watched Return Of The Jedi.I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it lacks the heart of the first two movies, as the politics of the human/mutant divide is replaced with a bland villain (who would be no more than a villain of the week in the Supergirl TV show) who wants (predictably) to destroy the world.If I did not know they were in Dark Phoenix, I'd be pretty sure this was the last time we'd will see the great James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence in their roles, they are surprisingly subdued. Although a scene with Fassbender's Eric, did make my 13 year old son gasp in horror. Sophie Turner (so good as Sansa Stark in Game Of Thrones) is ok as Jean Grey, but I'm surprised she got the solo movie from it.As for Jackman, he has a brief cameo, I'm not even sure he has a line of dialogue. At least I can't remember if he does.X-Men Apocalypse grossed $155 million at the domestic box office, to end 2016 as the 17th highest grossing movie of the year. So it grossed slightly more than X-Men: First Class (the last X-Men movie without Jackman's Wolverine) But it ended up in the same spot, come the end of the year.You have to wonder where the Franchise will go without Jackman's Logan/Wolverine."
" A solid end to a beloved franchise.
",0.5994,0.9661,2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"I'll admit that I was excited for this film, mostly because I was somewhat familiar with its premise. I grew up on the X-Men: Evolution TV show, so I knew that the defining arc of that series was none other than the Apocalypse arc. This may have actually spoiled the movie for me, because it wasn't quite in line with the plot I knew. Sure, Bryan Singer returned to direct this penultimate piece of the X-Men franchise, but there were just a few things that bugged me about this movie.First off, one of the elements of the previous prequel films I liked and appreciated was the inclusion of historical events and people into the storyline. This way it felt like an alternate reality not so far removed from our own. While there were loose elements of this present, it wasn't nearly as integrated as it had been done in the past. Add to this the atrocious fashion and styles of the 1980's, and I was more distracted by what people were wearing than what they were doing. Secondly, I felt some of the new characters, most of all Psylocke (Olivia Munn), were underdeveloped and included only because they were part of the source material's plot.Now, that's not to say this was a bad movie, because it wasn't. Since it filled the gap between the other prequels and the first X-Men movie, there were certain developments which were exciting to watch. Some of the other character introductions, like Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), were also important, knowing what happens in the rest of the films. Once again, Quicksilver (Evan Peters) steals the show with his slow-motion sequence and witty banter. I may have to see this film again with a different perspective (i.e. not using the animated show as my background) to really appreciate it for what it is.A solid end to a beloved franchise, I give X-Men: Apocalypse 4.0 stars out of 5."
" Love this .... perfect casting

" Storyline problem
",-0.4019,0.3806,2019-03-01 00:00:00,6,"As my personal review, I think this movie is not as good as the previous film X-MEN Day of the future past. There are 2 points I need to state.
First of all, to me, the storyline seems lack of creativity comparing to last film, it is still the old fashioned ""Ancient open "" then time travel to the main storyline just like ""The Mummy 2001"".
Second, when I saw this movie, I expected the scene to be cooler than the previous film. At least when Apocalypse woke up at debris and started to roam around the Cairo, I thought that scene could be longer so it can involve the more interaction between Apocalypse and Storm before asking her to join the team, because in reality, when you had slept for the long time and suddenly woke up, what you need to do is find a place to eat and stay before thinking what you need to do at this circumstance. For the apocalypse, the director just simply let him wake up then within a few minutes he started to think about ruling the world, Isn't it happening too fast.
Also, the whole stream simply copied X Men 2 which have many scenes happened in different countries, to me, this is too complicated and sometimes I couldn't form my senses to it"

" A lot of fun
",0.5106,0.9827,2019-02-10 00:00:00,8,"In a vacuum, this film was amazing. Apocalypse was menacing. The younger iterations of Storm, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops were fantastic. Quicksilver's spotlight moment was even more monumental than ""Days of Future Past."" There is so much good about this movie, but it falters for a reason that isn't even bad, just overdone. It feels weird to complain about the focus on Magneto, Professor X and Mystique when all three actors turn in very strong performances, but in the sixth film thrusting them to the center, audiences need a break, especially when there is so much other talent to be harvested. Even with the flawed focus, Bryan Singer turns in another strong installment with great action, well-timed humor and a masterful handling on"
" ok , but with problems
",-0.4497,0.8513,2019-01-13 00:00:00,6,"The biggest problem with the movie is they didn't know what to do with Apocalypse. He is just way to powerful to go out like that and felt more like a tool just to introduce the younger X-men for upcoming movies.Then there is the Raven/ Jennifer Lawrence issue where the Actor playing the character is a bigger deal then the character should be to the plot. Do not get me wrong Raven is a pretty big character in the X-men world but not big enough to have 1/3 of the plot/screen time.The X-men movie franchise is in an odd spot with Hugh Jackman/Wolverine gone and besides Magneto , Professor X , Beast and quicksilver I'm not sure they picked the right actors for such key characters for the rest of the X-Men. Then on top of that Deadpool is doing such a great job and i believe there is room for both Franchises but it's getting to the point where i would rather see X-men characters in Deadpool movies since they seen to handle them betterThis is more of my personal thoughts rather then a review so yea........"
" I just hope another studio produces future X-Men films
",0.4404,0.8389,2019-01-10 00:00:00,6,"1. The costumes and make-up look too polished. While it's great the make-up artists and actors put this much time into it, it just doesn't look real/epic or able to carry a franchise.2. Oscar Isaac as the villain is not the optimal choice. While he does great in Star Wars and he's a good actor, he looks out of place in this role for most parts.
I'm not sure about some others in the cast either, but maybe it's just the script or costumes/editing.3. 'X-Men: Apocalypse' feels more like a set-up for future films. They seem to be struggling to find things that work. Almost the whole movie feels like an academy for something more great.4. The plot didn't convince me at several times, while the main idea is good.5. CGI was fine for the most parts, but not always.6. Too many characters/mutants aren't mature enough. For example watching Wolverine (Logan) act does always(!!) feel great and sorta epic, while a lot (not all of them) of the others have to play teenage characters who don't have a real identity yet and it is annoying over time."

It made me hopeful that Apocalypse would maintain First Class' style of focusing on a small number of characters to give us a chance to relate to the characters. However, Apocalypse returned to the old trilogy's system of dividing the screen time between so many characters that it becomes impossible to fully relate to any of them. The result is a generally interesting, but never fully entertaining, film that seems to drag on rather than play out nicely."

""X-Men: Age of Apocalypse"" is no exception.The dialogue is cringe-inducing. The characters are flat and their portrayals are shallow at best, which is a shame, given the acting credentials of those involved. At times, the film even seems disjointed, making it feel more like a 2 1/2 hour trailer.The only redeeming features, to me, were some of the action sequences. Quicksilver, in particular, was amusing, and lent some levity to the otherwise pretty boring proceedings.In brief, I'm glad I watched this via online free streaming, as I wouldn't pay money to see it in a cinema, to buy the DVD, or even to contribute to it via any sort of subscription."

One example would be that Storm and Jean fight alongside Kurt/Nightcrawler in this movie. Yet, when they find him in the church in the future (X Men 2), they'd never met him and have no idea who he is. Another example is that young Jean seems to be massively powerful in this movie, yet in the first two films she'd barely learnt to use her telepathy, let alone her telekinesis.
Also, Mystique's costume is way off. The shade of blue is far too dark, and her markings are completely different to the four movies before this."

The story has a few problems, I have millions of problems with this movie but I overall had a fun time, I may even go as far as to say this is better than days of future past. Like I said I do have many problems with this movie, the pacing isn't as good as other xmen movies, some characters are just there and don't get the development they deserve (mainly storm, jean gray, most of apocalypse's horsemen), the character designs are just alright, SPOILER ALERT the final scene with jean using her powers on apocalypse made him seem weak, I mean there was lots of scenes in the movie that made him seem like an unkillable god and completely scary and unbeatable. Yet jean just uses her fire powers that were never explained or brought up in the movie at all. The scene is fantastic visually and the pacing is extremely well done in that scene alone. Quicksilver is great like always, and he does get more character development that he deserved in days of future past, and this does make him an equally interesting character. Magneto was one of the best characters in this movie and is developed perfectly, unlike the other xmen movies he actually has a purpose to be evil in this movie and it is well executed and thought out for a motivation to become the magneto we all know and love. The villain had a lot of problems but I overall loved him, he was extremely menacing and terrifying and proposed a huge threat to the xmen. Though I did have problems with how he lost. The xmen themselves didn't get as much development which kinda hurt, after the battle against apocalypse storm just kinda left apocalypse and was like ""Yeah I will join you, OK."" Which really bothered me, where is the setup? Why does she join the team! It makes no sense! Other than that Xmen apocalypse was a fun time at the movies. You will probably not compare it to infinity war although this is the equivalent to infinity war for the xmen. I still had fun regardless of the problems and give it a solid 7/10.

Bryan Singer has made great films before this one, like X2, Days Of Future Past, and The Unusual Suspects. But this film is dog poop. Similar to Alien: Covenant, I really thought this film is bullcrap compared to the other movies in their series. My least favorite aspect of this movie is the villain. He is essentially the bad guy that comes back after thousands of years to destroy the world. We've seen it thousands of times in movies, and Bryan Singer can really do better than this. I also didn't really care about the backstories of the mutants. They didn't really interest me because they were uninteresting and their kind of bland to be completely honest. The only characters I like in this movie is Quicksilver, Mystique, and Wolverine because we've seen them in other movies and we know they're likable characters. Michael Fassbender plays Magneto in this movie, and the movie didn't utilize him very well in my opinion. He's just like a mutant and bad stuff happens to him and we don't really feel for him because we don't see much of him in this movie. Other than the characters I like, I thought everyone else was either boring, unnecessary, or uninteresting. The script is also very unoriginal because we've seen stuff like this happen and it isn't a breath of fresh air. The climax also, is very cliche and if I could describe this movie in one sentence, it would be unoriginal. I really thought this movie was a bust, let's hope the future X-men movies are better than this. 3/10"

",0.0516,0.9875,2018-06-18 00:00:00,6,"It's not as complex and well constructed than X-Men: Days of Future Past but - BUT - it is still a very entertaining movie mostly because of the great cast. Not only the ""new"" additions of X-Men: Jean Grey, Cyclops, Nightcrawler and a little bit of Jubilee and more Quicksilver but also the ""baddies"" Archangel, Storm and Psylocke. Another BUT sadly brings us Apocalypse who just looks totally out of place here. He's a cartoon enemy in a film that tries to be serious. Magneto would've been enough of a man gone wild again but instead we get a god like character who makes us laugh every time he appears. There are some really nice moments of friendship and solidarity and a good way of the script to deal with Jennifer Lawrences unwillingness to get into blue Mystique shape again. It could've been better very easily but it's still enjoyable and far from being a disastrous (apocalyptic) movie."
" Just a good movie

Plus, the movie was well created to be presentable.The dialogue is always on point in the franchise. I'm also glad to see that Quicksilver is given a larger role. The ending scene in which Charles returns the memories he wiped out of Moira to her was emotional.However, there are some issues I had with this movie.Apocalypse was a little less threatening than I thought he'd be. I expecting him to be a villain who is the most powerful mutant of all mutants in the universe, yet he is defeated easily.Also, the death of one of my favorite characters, Alex Summers/Havok, was no surprise to me at all. Considering the fact that the character wasn't seen much in the promotional phase with the press and advertisements, I knew he wasn't going to stick around through the whole movie. Even when avoding spoilers, I just knew his despise will come up soon and it did.In conclusion, this is fairly great. Comic fans might expect a lot from these type of movies, but they got to give some credit for what was presented."

" THE SAME MOVIE
",0.0,0.9843,2018-06-06 00:00:00,6,"I can get over the occasionally bad CGI, the action scenes where characters throws stuff to each other or throws each other against some stuff, or the music that I can't remember, or the one dimensional villain (I don't have problem with Oscar Isaac's acting, but the writing), or the four horseman who are also one dimensional and join to Apocalypse because they got cool power boosts and stuff, but I can't get over the fact that this movie is the same like the previous 5 main X-Men movies just worst (except Last Stand)! Professor X and Magneto are friends but they're on the opposite sides, but then they're join forces again to beat the big bad guy. There's the emotional struggles, but they're not hit as much as in the previous two movies. I'm not so much the fan of the Wolverine scene, the Jean Grey stuff at the end was good, but it only hit when you find out he's in the movie, but then the next scenes just doesn't deliver. The things that saves this film for me, is the few callbacks, the acting of the young X-Men, and the Quicksilver running scene. That is crazy, and should have been in a movie that deserves it. The funniest thing is when the young X-Men watched Return of the Jedi and they acknowledge that always the third movie is the worst. 
So it questions: They're made it the worst of the trilogy intentionally? But then my question is: Why? It could have been the best X-Men movie! First Class is my favorite because it's first class in the presentation of what it wants to tell. But I don't get mad if they make a better movie! I still love the characters, just please challenge them more next time! And let Matthew Vaughn direct another X-Men movie!(I've watched it when it's premiered in my country. But for some reason it was in my mind in the last few days. So this is why I wrote this after two years :D)"
" Solidly good
",0.4404,-0.9513,2018-05-30 00:00:00,10,"The latest X-Men movie (excluding Logan) sees the new recruits (and some old friends) playing for high stakes. In the darkest X-men film yet we meet new villain Apocalypse, who is actually the oldest villain of all.In pre-Biblical Egypt, despotic mutant En Sabah Nur (who derives life and powers by parasitically transferring himself into new bodies from time to time) is betrayed during a transfer and buried alive, though dormant, for nearly 6,000 years. Reawoken in 1983, he needs to find powerful mutants to act as his henchmen: this coincides with Charles Xavier starting to use Cerebro to find pupils for his school, Mystique looking to rescue persecuted mutants, and Magneto enjoying family life.I was a little worried before going to see this, because I had heard suggestions that it wasn't that good. I've enjoyed all the previous X-Men films (yes, even the Wolverine origin one), and I've read a fair number of X-Men comics, so I was predisposed towards enjoyment but, still, you worry, don't you?I loved it. It's full of action, the plot is easy enough to follow but dense enough to satisfy, there are sufficient returning cast members to give a sense of continuity, and the new characters (and recast younger versions of characters from the first 3 films) all do well.All is not 100% wonderful, though - it is much darker than previous X-men films, for instance. There are deaths which are emotionally effective (by which I mean upsetting), and there is some imagery which, even in a 12A certificate film, could be regarded as a little disturbing. This is not an exciting family adventure movie (although it is exciting, Xavier's children are a family, and the whole thing is an adventure): it's a bit strong for the young and sensitive. And although the film runs two and a half hours, one wonders if there might be material left on the cutting room floor because, for instance, poor Olivia Munn as Psylocke gets fairly short shrift in what amounts to an underwritten cameo, despite looking exactly like her comics counterpart ie. seriously hot.But there is far more good than bad. Quicksilver's set piece steals the film again, much as it did in X-Men: Days Of Future Past. And there are two points - one of them hinted at in the trailer - which are cause for serious fangasms. Seriously. The unexpected one choked me up: I couldn't believe what I was seeing on screen.Which begs a question as to whether it is possible to enjoy the film if you haven't seen the previous X-Men movies or read any of the comics? Well, I spoke to someone who had just seen it, but hadn't seen any of the previous films, and he said that he thoroughly enjoyed it. So that's two points of view for the price of one.My verdict: as an established X-Men fan, both comics and movies, I would give this a full 10 out of 10."

",0.0,0.5223,2018-04-27 00:00:00,5,"Being a fan of X-Men and the Marvel Universe growing up will only hurt your opinions of this film as the characters are but pale translations of their counterparts in the comics and Fox cartoon. Case-in-point: the eponymous villain himself. Apocalypse is one of the most powerful villains in the X-Men stories with a vast array of powers. Yet, here, none of those powers are portrayed. The character himself is bland, lacking presence, and not nearly as bombastic as the Apocalypse I remember and loved as a kid. That version, the authentic one, spoke in big, deep, booming voice with menacing tones and a hint of something technological. His monologues and dialogue in the cartoon were among the most memorable part of that experience, speaking in biblical language and with a God-like demeanor. None of that drama makes it into this film.Most of the movie is not only predictable, but boring. With a few exceptions, it is both unengaging and formulaic, whereas the Marvel Cinematic Universe titles have since proven to at least avoid being one of those two things. The flashiness of the X-Men series is also unfitting for the darkness of the plotline here.While X-Men Apocalypse is still much better than the previous titles from the early 2000's, it still falls quite short of being able to capture the imagination the way or bring the kind of authentic laughs, drama, or depth that Guardians of the Galaxy, Iron Man, or Deadpool were able to achieve."
" Perhaps the weakest of the main-line 'X-Men' movies; occasionally entertaining, if generic.

A joke is made about the third always being the weakest - likely a jab at 'X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)', ironically a better film than this - but all this does is call extra attention to the fact that this piece only further adds proof to that old adage. There's limited, dumb enjoyment to be had when things get underway and the action is brought to the forefront, though. 5/10"

A lot of people thought Apocalypse should have been more intimidating but I liked how they made him seem really kind and caring at times. Like the kind of guy who could convince people to follow him on this crazy conquest. The scenes with Erik and his family were both sweet and heartbreaking, I love the new cast for the young X-Men (Sansa as Jean Grey is PERFECT) and I really bought into Charles story as well. The stuff with Rose Byrnes character is unneeded but she's barely in it so I don't really care. But the element that really sucks, I mean rreeeeeaaaaallllyyyyyy just destroys entire scenes, is Mystique. Who is Mystique? She's a thug, she's a badass, she hates humans for the ridicule she suffered as youth from her colleagues and own family. She's also an intelligent and myschevieous manipulator. They really got that with the Rebecca Romaign Mystique was well as the DOFP one. But who is she in this one? The great hero everyone looks up to, the one to unite and inspire all the young mutants to fight against the forces of evil, the one who TURNS ONE OF THE MAIN VILLAINS GOOD!!! Why is this? Because it's Jennifer Lawrence playing her and damnit, she can't not be Katniss in a big budget adventure film anymore! She's also barely blue in this? I mean I love JL to death, but maybe get an actor whose willing to sit in that makeup chair for the role??So all in all, this is nowhere near a bawls film. It's well written, well shot and directed and the music by John Ottman is as always great. But man, that Mystique plot is so, SO unimaginably awful and cheesy, it really bogs this one down. If they just edited her out of the movie, it probably would have gotten a 9 from me, or even maybe a 10. As it is though, this one gets a 7 from me."

" Fitting finale
",0.0,0.9968,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'X-Men: Apocalypse' is the sixth X-Men film and the final piece in the second trilogy (2011-2016), fitting in after 'Days of Future Past' and before 'X-Men' (2000). Although the time travel of the previous film does leave a somewhat altered ""reality"", so it doesn't necessarily all fit together nicely. Plot's pretty simple - Apocalypse/En Sabah Nur (Isaac) is the first mutant, with the ability to collect other mutants' powers, and he's now been resurrected and wants to destroy the world so only the strong survive. Plenty of Nazi parallels, and they use Magneto (Fassbender) and his Jewish past to emphasize this.Some of the films like repeating the same territory, as they have to re-establish the ""new"" characters: Jean (Turner), Cyclops (Sheridan), Havoc (Till), Nightcrawler (Smit-McPhee) and how they fit in with Xavier (McAvoy) and his school. I guess after the other two films, they needed Mystique (Lawrence), but I'm not sure why she needs to play such a big part. And Beast (Hoult) is mostly wasted, along with Apocalypse's Horsemen - Storm (Shipp), Psylocke (Munn) & Angel (Hardy). Some great CGI and large-scale chaos shown, but also some nice soft-touch moments, particularly between Charles & Erik - something Singer did well in the original film. One of the best bits is near the end when they almost verbatim repeat something from the 2000 film - and there's another nice tongue-in-cheek moment when they come out of seeing 'Return of the Jedi' (forgot to mention the film's set in 1983!)I loved Metallica's 'The Four Horsemen' playing when Apocalypse turns Angel into the metal-winged Archangel, worked great for the scene. Quicksilver (Peters) - despite being dead in the 'Avengers' films and only 10 years younger than Fassbender - is a very welcome addition here and has some great moments, particularly the Eurythmics bit. It doesn't follow any particular comic storyline completely, but borrows from a few, with only a few nods to the 1990s 'Age of Apocalypse'. Magneto's motivation could've been better, for me, but the scenes he and Xavier are in are always good. Issac is menacing but not too over-the-top as Apocalypse, but somehow, even with the world (slowly!) crumbling, it doesn't all click quite as well as you feel it could. Definitely a worthy addition to the franchise, but still a shame they never reached the pinnacle set by the original X-Men film."

It is a long list. But this movie has ALL those problems. There is ZERO character development, just lots of winks and nudges about previous movies in the franchise. Actors like Isaac and Fasbender are wasted. Villains' motivations never make sense (let alone their powers). It is just a mess. ""First Class"" showed so much promise, but this one did not deliver."

The film takes place in 1983 with our characters looking the same age as they were in 2014. I guess X-Men stop aging. The first half of the film re-introduces characters and relationships as we get a glimpse of the bad guy who turns out to be a Trekkie watching a very appropriate episode where man rejects the god Apollo and kills him (sort of.) The film has all the bells and whistles of an X-men production, and anything that has J-Law in a painted blue suit can't be all bad. In their quest for bad guys, there are just so many rogue X-men and aliens out there so they opt to kill Apocalypse who claims he was Re, but also Elohim, the God of the Old Testament. During a time tunnel warp we get a glimpse of a Jesus statue and wonder what the script writers were implying as now the God of The OT is a bad guy who wants to destroy the world (okay maybe He does with that apocalypse thing) and the X-Men are the good guys who must stop and kill him. The theme would be rather controversial if they dwelt on it, rather than just glance by it and allow the uninformed viewer to never connect the dots.In spite of the X-Men changing history in the last film, there has been no ripple effect going forward. Reagan still becomes President, Annie Lennox becomes a pop star etc.The special effects are what who would expect for a $178 million dollar production. I was hoping for a better script.Guide: The old gods aka Apocalypse is bad and must die. J-Law looks nearly naked. Something that sounds like half the F-word was spoken. Wolverine makes a cameo appearance and neither swears nor shows his naked butt for a change. Kudos on getting past that."
" BEST OF THE XMEN SERIES,underrated.
",0.7125,0.981,2017-11-23 00:00:00,10,"Wow.I was absolutely entranced by this one.having seen all the x-men and wolverine offerings out there,I'd have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie,perhaps because it was the last I got to see,and so filled the gap between Days of future past and Old Man Logan. And yet not when you think about it. By the title I was expecting it to be something else. Something akin to the Apocalyptic series in which mankind and X- men,well see for yourself. I still feel that there's room for one more to REALLY fill the gap between aforementioned movies. How does it play out that mutants all get practically wiped out to lead us into Logan(essentially Old Man Logan)? Maybe they'll make that movie. But probably not as it would play out a little too bleak even for this universe... Still.X-men Apocalypse is a much more satisfying movie than all that came before and does aptly tie up all the loose ends of the other movies. What I especially loved was that for once Wolverine wasn't abused for excessive screen time as normally happens but the bit that he is in is priceless and a little stoke of genius from the writers. I also love how much it makes you have to think in terms of the exact repercussions of Days of Future Past and where that leaves every character(Back to the Future type of complications,etc) And I found the characters to be at their most fleshed out of all in this one. And best main Villain portrayal ever by Oscar Isaac.Love how difficult it is to recognize the actor playing him.It did help that i didn't know/forgot before watching and had to look it up after the movie.

" Not as good as its predecessors...
",-0.3412,-0.9043,2017-11-19 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed the first half of the film! Unfortunately it fell flat in the second half, especially the last 45 Minutes. A lot of the film was a repeat of a lot of things already done in earlier films. Michael Fassbender is as great as ever and Magneto's story-line is fantastically done. James McAvoy is great too. Wolverines cameo was fun but the whole Stryker sequence felt unnecessary to the film as a who;e. Jennifer has always been miss cast as Raven/Mystique and it is a shame they haven't recast her yet as a lot of her scenes are cringe- worthy. Apocalypse was a rather boring villain in this film and the new actors/actresses playing young versions of Jean Grey and Cyclops were disappointing to say the least. Out of the 6 X-Men films this is only better (by far) than the terrible X-Men 3: The Last Stand but is not as good as the other 5. It had a lot of potential but I think bad casting and over reliance on boring CGI, especially towards the end bring it down sadly. It is worth a watch and I am still giving it a generous 7 stars."
" The Worst of Bryan Singer's X-MEN Movies
",-0.6249,0.9943,2017-09-12 00:00:00,5,"X-MEN: APOCALYPSE is the worst film in the franchise since X-MEN: ORIGINS. I don't think any X-MEN movie will ever be as big a failure as ORIGINS, but believe me when I say I'd rather watch THE LAST STAND again before I ever revisit APOCALYPSE. That relative disappointment, while wreaking as much havoc with the source material as APOCALYPSE, was at least entertaining to sit through. I was so incredibly bored with this latest X- Men adventure that I could've fallen asleep in the theater. It's nearly two and a half hours long and I can count moments I actually enjoyed in this movie on one hand. My distaste for the movie is even more depressing because there has not been an X-Men comic storyline I've been more excited to see on the big screen than one featuring Apocalypse. This movie should've been a surefire success. It incorporates my favorite X-Men villain with promises then of seeing his Four Horsemen, and it has the chance to dramatically affect the future of the X-Men cinematic universe and perhaps take things in an exciting new direction. What we got instead was a lukewarm villain who never felt threatening in the least who's wasted in a dull globe-trotting ""adventure"" where we spend half the movie waiting for Apocalypse to recruit his Horsemen before returning to Egypt for a big messy final battle where Magneto, as the most powerful member of Apocalypse's posse, unleashes a CG debris storm visually identical to countless other summer blockbusters.For an Apocalypse storyline to have been done any real justice, it would've needed to been released as a trilogy of films. The brief moment of excitement I experienced when it was revealed the 2016 movie would adapt Apocalypse for the big screen was short-lived when I realized they'd be cramming everything into a single movie. There was a lot of promise in introducing this major villain but it was squandered pretty painfully. As Fox often does, they've made modifications to characters to fit their movie universe but the basic premise of Apocalypse remains intact. Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is the world's oldest mutant, dating back to ancient Egypt and beyond. He's a mutant of immense power who, as the movie opens, is having his essence transferred into a new host mutant which gives him a couple benefits: (1) a form of immortality and (2) access to his host mutant's abilities, adding them to Apocalypse's existing roster. He's betrayed in ancient times and left trapped under the rubble of a collapsed pyramid in stasis before he's uncovered in the early 1980's and reawakened. He takes a quick look around at the state of the world and despises that humans have risen to power over mutant-kind. Apocalypse, a firm believer in ""survival of the fittest"", decides to remind the world who's in charge. He recruits his ""Four Horsemen"", powerful mutants who serve as his lieutenants and protectors in his moments of weakness: in this case, he's collected Storm, Angel, Psylocke, and Magneto.Now just because the movie is boring and squanders an awesome opportunity doesn't mean it's a total bust. There are a few small moments I appreciated. There's a quip as the latest batch of X-kids are exiting a movie theater after having watched RETURN OF THE JEDI and someone (I think it was Jean Grey) cracks a joke about the third movie in trilogy is always the weakest. I'm sure they'd intended it as a dig at Brett Ratner's THE LAST STAND but, sorry Bryan Singer, it just as readily applies to APOCALYPSE and that's honestly how I read it. Around the same time, we get the Quicksilver sequence. I'm sure most people can agree that Quicksilver's slow-motion escape sequence in DAYS OF FUTURE PAST was the most memorable moment so the studios, also recognizing that, give us yet another in APOCALYPSE as Quicksilver arrives at the X-Mansion just in time to evacuate everyone in super speeds to the beat of Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"". A rehash from a studio hoping to capitalize on the love for the original sequence? Sure, but it works. And finally, the only other moment in the entire film where I felt the briefest flash of hope for this surely never-ending film franchise was the very last minute in the movie when the new (old) team of X-Men are assembled in the Danger Room in costumes that more accurate to their comic counterparts than they've ever been before in these Fox movies.APOCALYPSE was a real bummer of an X-MEN movie but I'm not going to let it ruin any anticipation of future movies. The series is now, what? 9 movies in? And we've had only a couple that disappointed me and one that was a total misfire. My problems with APOCALYPSE aren't enough to override the fun I've had in this series in so many of the other films. X-MEN movies aren't going anywhere anytime soon and my frustration with APOCALYPSE will eventually fade, and all we can do is hope that Singer gives us a better film when he returns with his new vision of the Dark Phoenix arc."

",0.0,0.9868,2017-08-27 00:00:00,4,"Marvel's 'X-Men' series has never been a mega hit among moviegoers. There's definitely a core fanbase that appreciates the film adaptations of the comic book franchise, but as 'X-Men: Apocalypse' has proved, there comes a point when it feels like things are just being rehashed and the fire of originality has gone cold.In 'Apocalypse,' we see again the ""first class"" (i.e. new kids on the block) of mutants (played again by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, etc.) as they take on the latest threat to mankind - an evil super-mutant named Apocalypse (portrayed by Oscar Isaac). The premise is straightforward - perhaps too straightforward - and so the plot is one of the weakest parts of 'Apocalypse.' It has a ""been there, seen that"" kind of vibe, which is only acceptable in films that overcompensate in other areas.Unfortunately, 'Apocalypse' does not have this benefit. The acting is second-rate at best. While Fassbender naturally does the best job, a lot of this is based on how Magneto's character is written. It's surprising to see Lawrence's portrayal of Raven/Mystique feel like such an afterthought, but to be fair, she signed on to this franchise before she was the megastar that she is. The one other bright spot here is Sophie Turner, as she gives it her all in trying to convey the internal struggles Jean Grey faces.Everything else in 'Apocalypse' is forgettable or throwaway, similar to the previous installment - 2014's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past."" From generic special effects to forced dialogue littered with cringeworthy one-liners, it's easy to see the well has run dry when it comes to creativity. While Bryan Singer has been at the helm for the majority of this franchise, it's time he folds up his director's chair and lets someone else take a turn.There's nothing special about 'X-Men: Apocalypse,' but then again, there hasn't been much special about this franchise for quite some time."
" Rating: B-
",0.0,0.9934,2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"After X-Men: Days of Future Past, I was excited to watch this movie, Bryan Singer has directed all the good X-Men films and this one had the potential to be another one. Now, when I saw the critic's reviews for this I was really concerned, but I really think they overreacted on this one. It's actually a good movie, with some issues that I'm going to discuss further, but it's not the disaster that they're trying to display.I'll start with what I think was the main problem of this movie and what I think made the critics disconnect from it: Apocalypse. This character should have been so much better. In the first 30min of the film, we are told his backstory in Egypt and it's not captivating or interesting ... At all. It's really slow paced and I didn't feel like I was caring for any of that. Also, Apocalypse isn't intimidating at all, there are several scenes where he's standing side-to-side with other characters and he's barely taller than them. His voice worked for me, but his motivations weren't clear. Oscar Isaac already proved he's a good actor, so I don't think it was his fault that Apocalypse looked like that, he just did what he had to do.This is the main reason why I think critics gave such bad reviews because, after a scene with Magneto and his family in a forest, I didn't take my eyes off the screen for one second. Some critics might have just shut down before this scene happened and that's why the reviews are so negative. The movie really builds up from here and it ends with the most action-heavy sequence of all X-Men films.First, the actors: Fassbender and McAvoy work brilliantly together, their scenes are always the best for me and Fassbender is amazing, I was awed by his performance. Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers/Cyclops and Sophie Turner as Jean Grey are great, I can't wait to watch more movies with them. Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique is fine, but I don't understand why they needed to show more of Raven than Mystique, I guess the actress didn't like the blue skin so much. Alexandra Shipp finally brings an accent to Storm that fans always criticized Halle Berry for and Evan Peters as Quiksilver ... He's just awesome. I didn't believe they would be able to make a better speed-scene than in the previous movie, but they did! IT'S AWESOME!Now, the end scene is the most action-heavy of all the X-Men movies, like I said before. It's really well shot and I have to say that there's a lot of fan service throughout the film, but in this last act, there are two scenes that they spoiled in the last trailer ... I didn't watch the last trailer, actually, I didn't watch any trailer, so I was really pleased with those particular scenes, involving a known character and all (stop watching trailers, it's way more interesting and captivating this way). Usually, ending a movie with a lot of fights, explosions and all that stuff can take away the film's focus in the story, but I don't think it did because of all the personal scenes that they were able to introduce between the fights.One big issue of this movie is clearly the pacing, they take a lot of time to introduce all these characters and to start building up. In one scene, Apocalypse is looking for mutants, then it's Mystique looking for mutants ... There's a lot of looking and no action whatsoever and that bothered me a little. Apocalypse's motivations remain unclear until the last 10 minutes of the movie and that's a long time. It's a bold move from Bryan Singer because he makes me spend the entire movie worried about something that I shouldn't have been. Re-watching this film, I'll probably understand better this character, but I don't know if it was the right decision to organize the story like this.It's not the best X-Men movie for sure, but it's far better than most of the others. It has some narrative problems and the character of Apocalypse is not the best possible, but it's still a good movie. It's probably more captivating watching a second time ...MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" Best X-Men film to date
",0.6369,0.99,2017-07-30 00:00:00,8,"Less review and more like criticism. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie since I didn't hear much praise about it. I thought it had a lot of really fun parts and by far the main scenes with Quicksilver were the best, but this movie had a lot of really good scenes. Only issues I saw was the posing of the bad guys on this hill seemed a little boring. Perhaps they should have been doing something interesting than just standing around Apocalypse. I also wanted there to be a lot more of a relationship with Archangel and him since it was pretty important in the comic book, but the actor who played the role didn't seem to be more than just the visually interesting. A few kind of off parts, but in general very moving and interesting. Funny enough I didn't think Days of Future Past was as good, but most reviewers seem to like that better."
" In storytelling, size doesn't matter
",-0.0191,0.9889,2017-07-23 00:00:00,6,"Here's the thing about telling a story: size doesn't matter. A small-scale personal drama -- even without any dialog (!) -- can be utterly gripping (e.g. ""All is Lost'), and contrarily a planet-smashing tale can be totally boring (e.g. any ""Transformers"" -- and I'm looking at you, ""Independence Day"" sequel).I'd really like to rate this X-Men instalment higher, because I'm fond of their series of movies and their characters, but I have to recognize that X-Men: Apocalypse has fallen into a trap of its own making. They seem to feel that every one of their outings has to be Bigger Than The Last Time to keep people coming. Wrong! You just need a good story to tell, and characters we can care about. The fate of the planet doesn't have to be at stake every time around. ""First Class"" was good overall and ""Days of Future Past"" might even be described as great. But ""Apocalypse"" -- a step back.To be fair, there's lots to be positive about in many scenes. The new X-Men characters now seen in the past at a young stage are fun to see. The CGI is all fine and there are some excellent set-pieces such as Quicksilver's retrieval of all of the mutant kids *while* the school is blowing up, and the fight in Charles' mind between him and Apocalypse. The buildup to Jean finally hitting the big baddie with full power is also a good payoff for what we were all waiting for -- she cuts loose as Phoenix with the full light show and a great, blood-curdling primal scream to boot. Good stuff.But on the other hand: some things are just too much. I couldn't really go with Magneto disassembling structures everywhere around the world at once (sorry folks, but the inverse-square law works for magnetism too). Or Apocalypse blowing away Cairo with a few gestures (how many million people was that?). This is just too big to feel involved with. And sadly, some of the actors looked sort of uncomfortable. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were reliable, but I felt that Jennifer Lawrence, who's really a great actress, was kind of phoning it in here (as, frankly, she did with the Hunger Games).Once you've destroyed the Earth there's nothing obvious left to Make It Bigger but to go interstellar, which seems to be what's up for their next round in X-Men: Dark Phoenix, based on one of the top story lines from the classic X-Men comics. We'll see if they can get back on track. I hope so."
" Hugely Underwhelming
",0.0,0.6899,2017-07-20 00:00:00,4,"Compared to the other X-Men films this was a big letdown. The first quarter of the movie starts out somewhat promising but then quickly spirals downward as one dimensional characters get introduced with nothing left to offer. The only heartfelt performances that were given were by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. The main villain felt meh and pretty typical. The film is set in the 80s and doesn't even feel like that whatsoever. The only entertaining scene is when quicksilver rescues everyone out of the academy before it explodes. Other than that the movie is filled with typical battle scenes that you have seen time and time again through every regurgitated super hero movie made in the past 15 years. It feels just like an extended IGN game concept trailer. The movie is called apocalypse but nothing really feels apocalyptic as you don't see people getting killed just buildings so it doesn't feel like there is any danger to humanity itself. If you're expecting basic CGI saturated mutant battle scenes that you've seen time and time again then you're in luck, but if you're expecting a meaningful story plot line then you will be disappointed."

",-0.6808,-0.0516,2017-07-11 00:00:00,1,"I have enjoyed all of the X-men movies except for the Wolverine movies and X-Men Apocalypse which were both total garbage.

There wasn't one redeeming thing about this movie."

The movie is a long, drawn-out addition to the franchise, morally ambiguous (apparently, Magneto killing Polish police is OK and everyone is OK with that at the end, shaking hands and parting ways), clichéd to the max (complete with college bully-in-toilet-scene) and with a plot depth of practically nothing. Avoid with prejudice."

" Apocalyptic Levels of Entertaining Nonsense
",-0.6369,-0.0449,2017-06-10 00:00:00,6,"X-Men: Apocalypse is a movie about an ancient Egyptian mutant Pharaoh with blue skin and godlike powers who transfers his soul between bodies via magic golden goo using his solar powered pyramid who gets buried underground for thousands of years by his servants who didn't like him then wakes up in 1983 and decides to destroy/take over the world. Naturally, this results in many scenes featuring explosions, lasers, people punching each other, exposition about destroying or saving the world, some brief emotional interludes, and of course, more explosions and punching.Silliness aside, X-Men: Apocalypse is filled with lots and lots of, well, stuff. People, places, things, ideas, and everything else. Anytime one person, place, thing, or idea starts to get developed, all of a sudden something else is happening. We go from serious dramatic sequence, to superfluous semi-comedic fluff, to introducing this character, then that character, to giant CGI action scene, then introducing another unnecessary character, to lofty dialogue about the nature of good and evil, to a scene played for laughs set to pop music, to a psychic battle set inside a character's mind, and so on and so on. It's all over the place. Needless to say, movies like this have their place, particularly in the comic book genre; however, this certainly isn't the best the genre has to offer. A smaller cast of characters, a more consistent tone, and a shorter run time all would've helped this have more staying power.The movie does certainly have some genuinely great scenes scattered throughout. Unfortunately, many of them feel incredibly out of place in this glorious mess of a movie. That being said, for what this movie is, it works well enough to be tolerable and fairly entertaining throughout. However, it should be noted that if you have no familiarity with the X-Men comics and/or previous movies, it will make very little sense. But if every once and a while you like to see an over-the-top big budget movie that has 173 characters and subplots with giant computer generated battles and supervillains scheming to destroy/take over the world, you'll probably like this. The spectacle of it is impressive at the very least."
" Review – X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)
",0.0,0.998,2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"First things first, X-Men DOFP was by far the best film in the series. The movie shed ample light on the character sketches & plot, had some brilliant set-pieces on show, and of course a great titular lead in Wolverine. First Class, directed by Matthew Vaughn, introduced us to the younger generation of mutants and brought a fresh set of actors on-board. Bryan Singer, director of X-Men(2000), X2(2003) and DOFP(2014), yet again took over directorial duties to proffer the greatest X-Men antagonist of the 80s ..APOCALYPSE!The movie begins in 3600 BCE, where supreme ruler of Egypt, En Sabah Nur a.k.a Apocalypse, is betrayed by his clan to be inhumed alive all the while being protected by his Four Horsemen, only to be reawakened in 1983 to realize that much of the world has changed in his absence. He wants to regain control of the world he once ruled and decides to eradicate mankind off the face of the earth, in order to recreate it in his own impression. For this, he needs to acquire the powers of the telepathic genius Prof. Charles Xavier. Much of the first hour is spent in showcasing the recruitment spree undertaken simultaneously by En Sabah Nur, Mystique and Xavier at various locations. En Sabah Nur discovers his Four Horsemen in the form of Storm, Angel, Psylocke and Magneto, while we see the young Scott Summers a.k.a Cyclops getting introduced to the Mutant school by his brother, and Nightcrawler being saved by Mystique in an underground fight-club sequence. The rest of the film is how the confrontation between Xavier and En Sabah Nur, with their respective team of mutants, play out.It is refreshing to see the younger versions of the mutants take centre stage yet again, although not much is delineated with regard to why En Sabah Nur, allegedly the most powerful mutant ever, requires the help of his 'Four Horsemen'. Not that a superhero or comic-book fanatic wouldn't love to see those characters, it certainly would've helped had these characters been etched out a little more comprehensively. Erik Lensherr's story looked like it needed more detailing for the average viewer to care. It looked extremely rushed. These are some of the areas which lacked a smooth flow of narration in Simon Kinberg's screenplay.The crop of actors in Apocalypse however, makes sure that the movie does not lose its momentum at any point. Mcavoy does a neat job of playing Xavier, while Fassbender is great in the Poland portions but does not have much to do in the latter half. Jennifer Lawrence continues her good run, but like Fassbender, has a relatively subdued role in the latter portions of the movie. The cherry on the cake arrives in the form of Evan Peters' Quicksilver, who gets one of the best scenes in the whole movie. He, and Kodi Smit-McPhee who plays Nightcrawler, keeps the affairs light-hearted even in the most panicky situations. GOT's Sophie Turner plays the younger Jean Grey with much oomph. The rest of the cast pitch in with exemplary performances. Oscar Isaac, who plays En Sabah Nur, is amassed under truckloads of make- up, but tries his best to exhibit a sort of dark verve that is relevant to his character.The climactic set-piece is fun but tacky. Viewer interest is high when the villain has the upper hand, but at other times the scenes play out rather casually without much creative flurry. In other words, while you expect a big storm, all you are subjected to, is a bit of breeze and not much else. It is probably because DOFP was too good a predecessor and set the expectations bar very high. Nonetheless, Apocalypse holds its ground firm enough for things to get a lot better in the sequels. Wolverine's cameo was executed well, and the post-credits scene points all fingers towards the upcoming villain.As a closing note, it is advisable to treat Apocalypse as a gap filler unlike DOFP, which worked fine even as a stand-alone. Although quite entertaining with enough Easter eggs for comic book junkies, Apocalypse turns out to be an above-average fare overstuffed with characters not necessarily justifying the plot. The set-pieces do have their charm but are ultimately forgettable. Therefore, the film may not bring in hordes of new fans for the X- men series but could probably satisfy existing ones. Nevertheless, I'd still look forward to watching the upcoming Wolverine, Deadpool and Gambit sequels."

It has drama, suspense, thrill and joy, all in the same picture which keeps you glued to the screen until the finale. Although starting a bit slow, it gradually builds up tension until the big confrontation which is simply spectacular. I enjoyed it very much.It is another success from this beloved franchise and I truly hope that the upcoming ones will be at least as good."

" X-Men Apocalypse sucks ass the worst horrible awful stinker X-Men movie ever
",-0.959,-0.9996,2017-05-09 00:00:00,1,"*MAJOR SPOILERS* X-Men: Apocalypse is the worst apocalyptic STINKER movie ever, it is over long, over boring I hate this movie! This movie has no solid acting at all and this new X-Men movie really sucks ass! They made the film in the year 1983 the year I was born. This movie is not the year 1983, it was terrible digital filmed and it was terrible horrible shot and the timeline was set in this year 2016 and that was last year! I really didn't had a desire to write a review for this peace of s**t movie because I was really disappointed the last 3 movies really sucks they are really horrible movies.Bryan Singer has really no clue about making any good movies anymore, he screwed up Superman Returns and he screwed up this movie. Days of Future Past did end solid but the movie was still over long over boring and it sucked. I did liked First Class I thought was okay but this movie is the worst X-Men ever.STOP making sequels after sequels, remakes after remakes, reboots after reboots and prequels after prequels! This movie timeline was hell no in 1983 stop making the prequels already you stupid dick Singer! I am tired of prequels already. First Class had a prequel but it screwed up Professor Charles Xavier and Raven/Mystique from the first two movies because these two characters were never step sister and brother they were enemies in the first three movies gosh! Superman III was made that year 1983 and was set in that time in the 1983 my year I was born! Superman III was MILES hell better than X-Men Apocalypse this peace of s**t prequel movie! F**k this! Superman III get's 4.9 on IMDb score while this movie get's 7.1 are people that stupid?! Audience brainwashed by Critic's Ratings Sophie Turner do me the biggest favor and stop trying to be Jean Grey just stay in Game of Thrones please! Jennifer Lawrence sucks she sucks as Raven I want Rebecca Romijn back she was MILES better actress and a totally bad-ass the villain unlike Jennifer Lawrence and her shi*** character gosh. I am tired of her.Magneto (Michael Fassbender) please die already just die. So suddenly Magneto has a family and they are killed and he goes on a rampage haven't we see that one before in the first three movies? Jezus Christ! Yeah, forgiving Magneto like it's nothing after he helps to kill millions of people and destroy entire cities is included in the package. Also, he changes his mind about the whole ""destroy the world"" thing after Mystique tells him for the 100th time that he is her family and she still sees good in him. Disgrace!! Terrible script, terrible writing, poorly paced, useless f****** movie. I hate the timeline why 1983 why just why! Why the year I was born why? I hate this movie to death! I hate it, I hate it!!! I hate that Singer keeps doing that it is not logical! The main villain's motivation is bland and stupid. (Yeah, he just wants to kill everyone and rule the world.) The way he ""persuades"" other mutants to join him is absolutely unbelievable - he basically just offers to increase a mutant's power and in return demands help to kill billions of people.special effect and CGI are dumb and awfully look pretty stupid! Apocalypse is the worst boring none logical stupid villain in this movie. Enigmatic Apocalypse, ""played"" by Oscar Isaac is a giant moron of nothing, a very good actor covered up in tons of makeup to the point of anonymity, and given a motivation that should make sense but is actually less clear. James McAvoy retire his character sucks dick in this movie! the Four Horseman was lame and terrible this mutants in here sucks they suck ass! OK! the action scenes were lame (when there were action scenes)...and I don't care one bit about Fassbender or the new Xavier. Those actors do Absolutely Nothing for me.Apocalypse did look stupid and his voice was funny too and yes he was not the way how it was in comic books. Rose Byrne was not needed here!Another thing I forgot to mention: Nightcrawler was definitely not in in the prequel why? Watch X-Men 2 and you will see the picture. Jean Grey and Storm met Nightcrawler in X-Men 2 after that sequel that character was never mentioned before. But suddenly he appears as X-Men and he becomes a team member stupid! I am tired of Cyclops Jesus! X2: X-MEN UNITED WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE I rather watch that movie! X-Men the first movie was Miles way better than X-Men Apocalypse! X-Men: The Last Stand was WAY better than X-Men Apocalypse it ended solid and I loved Wolverine he is not in here at all!!! X-Men the 90s animated series and comics were always better than those god awful films. Apocalypse in the cartoon was more scarier and intimidating than in this. CAPTAIN America CIVIL WAR WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE, therefore I look forward to seeing many more Avengers films. Avengers Age of Ultron and Ant-Man were better than X-Men Apocalypse hands down.This movie was a failure score F 1/10 from now on I am staying away from X-Men movies. When new X-Men movies come out I am staying away."
" Stuff happens
",0.0,0.9566,2017-05-05 00:00:00,6,"I've been a fan of the 'X-Men' films since they first appeared on our (big) screens way back in 1999. The first two were great, I didn't even mind the third that much and the spin-offs were better (in my opinion!) than most people made out. Naturally, I was sceptical of the franchise's (soft) reboot with a new – much younger – cast. However, thanks to JJ Abram's style of rebooting a franchise, i.e. shove in aspects of time travel and a parallel universe to keep us die-hard fanboys quiet and it sort of worked out, blending old and new cast members alike. Then came the awkwardly-titled 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and I got completely lost. That may come from me not seeing its predecessor ('First Class') for a while, so I had kind of forgotten who's who. However, you would think that any film would need to be reasonably accessible to a new audience (or someone like me who had just forgotten what had happened before). Basically, it was a bit all over the place and people who were dead were now alive and people who were alive were now recast. Unfortunately, the latest 'X-Men Apocalypse' movie kind of feels more like 'Days of Future Past' than 'First Class.' It's quite a long film and so at least they try to give some of the characters a bit of an introduction. Even if you – technically – know who these characters are/were, they've most likely been recast, so you'll probably need a refresher on who they are and whether they're still playing roughly the same role as before. I guess the new cast are pretty good/relatable, but I'm afraid I'm used to the 'old lags' and it's like watching 'Muppet Babies' or 'Tiny Toons' only with mutants instead of miniature Kermit the Frog or Bugs Bunny (there's even a – practically – teenage Striker trying to hunt the mutants down!). We see our – now young – heroes going about their daily life, getting picked on by that clichéd bully we see in every Hollywood movie with a high school in it and the once fearsome Nightcrawler looks like he's about to cry most of the time. It just feels so far removed from the original 1999 'X-Men' movie that this is completely unrecognisable.Then – as my title suggests – stuff happens. We're treated to one scene after the other where someone does something. That's my main gripe with it. The story doesn't really go anywhere. Sure, the effects are good and the make-up believable, but it almost comprises on a load of stand-alone sketches that don't seem to follow on from the one before. We see the titular ('first mutant') 'Apocalypse' get released and then start recruiting for his higher-management team by generally making them 'level up' quicker than usual and a new haircut for free. Then we bounce back to the fledgling X-Men and so forth until they have to face off against him. I may enjoy the X-Men films, but I have to confess that I've never read the comics, so I can't really comment on how authentic Oscar Issac's look or performance is. All I know is that he looks pretty unrecognisable as the bad guy and is reasonably cool when it comes to villains and the villainous stuff they generally do, but as far as I understand the real comic book fans felt a little short-changed at his overall role.However, it all feels a little samey when you place 'X-Men Apocalypse' next to every other recent superhero movie these days (and also some NON superhero movies, too) as Apocalypse's big plan involves the almost mandatory 'skybeam' i.e. the giant computer-generated beam of light coming down and laying waste to a populated area. Yup, it does seem that that's every super villain's masterplan these days.So, did I hate it? Well, no. It's okay. Like I say – stuff happens. And, despite most not really following on from whatever stuff happened right before (and don't get me started on the whole film not really following on from the rest of the franchise!), some of the stuff that happens is kind of cool. So, it does have that going for it. I just think that it's all a bit of a wasted opportunity when you're presented with such great characters and none of them ever really feel like they're allowed to shine. I didn't think I wasted my time watching it, but out of all X-Men-related films, I think this is the one I'm least likely to bother watching again.Oh, and is it just me or is there a weird 'Mother Theresa cameo' near the start?"
" Not the Best in The Franchise, Not the Worst,
",-0.0191,0.765,2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"X-Men: Apocalypse is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a great cast. It certainly has some great moments and a slew of excellent new cast members playing younger versions of well known X-Men characters. Sophie Turner really stands out as Jean Grey, Tye Sheridan is an excellent fit for Cyclops and Kodi Smit-Mcphee has great physicality as Nightcrawler. The story itself is ineffective, it never really pulled me in, lingering on long, comic book elements to ensure that the whole Apocalypse story makes sense to people. The villain himself is also dull, Oscar Isaac is a stellar actor, but there was nothing he could do to make this character's cliché dialogue unique. There is also far too much action in this film, that takes away from developing these new characters and further establishing Professor X and Magneto. The biggest downfall, for me, had to be Jennifer Lawrence, who I do usually like as an actress, but her heart was not here at all, she looked tired and bored of this series throughout, not even making the effort of acting like she wanted to be there. The fact that this whole movie is basically an origin story of how Professor X lost his hair does not say much. While it has its moments, X-Men: Apocalypse gets tedious and is overall a disappointing installment for the franchise. The X-Men must reunite to put a stop to a powerful mutant known as Apocalypse. Best Performance: James McAvoy / Worst Performance: Jennifer Lawrence"
" Not thinking as a fan
",-0.2411,0.9883,2017-04-19 00:00:00,8,"The movie tells us the story of the first and most powerful mutant in the world, Who was kept underneath and in totally darkness. Long after he comes back to defeat humankind, beings that have taken control by hurting his mutants sons.Having not seen or reading any kind of comic and with all the x men movies already seen I want to say that this is a great movie. Especially because in this case some characters brought magic. This movie will make you laugh a little, but even more, the movie will make you feel defeated and powerless, and that is because of the villain, which is actually a great character. I would say that in my opinion there are two characters to highlight in the movie. I don't want to spoil the movie, so, I hope you will find them.Not everything is good. The movie is predictable. The story, even though it tries hard not to be a cliché, is actually led by the same mechanism of superhero movies, which will let you how the good ones always come together to win. Also, you can find some annoying things like stupid jokes.I want to recommend this movie to those who want to have a great time. And for the fans... I hope you have fun and do not get annoyed."

I really like the storyline and the casting. The prequels casting is much better than the first 3 movies. I didn't like the adult Jean but in Apocalypse, Sophie Turner is definitely a perfect choice for Jean! Nightcrawler is also one of the highlights of this movie, the acting, the fighting scene and the makeup, everything is perfect! I hope there will be a sequel to Apocalypse with all the characters in it. I do wish they had more Charles & Moira scenes together. It's interesting to see the ""love- sick"" side of Charles which we rarely get to see."

It had the same creative team of 'Days of Future Past' but despite this it didn't deliver. It flew too close to the sun and the hype of 'Days of Future Past' melted its wings.The types of people who will like this movie will probably be those who greatly enjoyed 'The Last Stand' because it bears numerous similarities to that film.Wouldn't Recommend.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Jennifer Lawrence was pretty good as Mystique and Sophie Turner was an alright Jean Grey. Michael Fassbender was amazing as Eric Lashner. Oscar Isaac tried and tried and performed his role with such sincerity but there is only so much you can do while wearing a balloon. Evan Peters was fantastic as Quicksilver and is easily my favourite character. Rose Bryne was weak as Moira and I still don't know why she needs to exists. I was also extremely disappointed by James McAvoy as Charles Xavier and I really didn't like how his character was presented.It was an interesting idea but it was poorly executed. It's way too over bloated and I really hated the ending. It felt like it had lower stakes than 'Days of Future Past'. It feel like two entirely separate movies with two entirely separate villains(Stryker and Apocalypse).The cinematography was fine.The effects were this movie's main strength and looked awesome and cool. Except for Apocalypse. Apocalypse looked atrocious.The action in this movie was really poor and, unlike its predecessors, it doesn't use its characters effectively and some of them were just there for the sake of it. It was an origin story for certain characters but this was poorly done and betrayed some of the characters pre-established personalities and traits. The humour failed. Quicksilver was, again, excellent but I actually preferred the sequence in 'Days of Future Past' due to its surprise factor and simplicity. There were some genuinely impactful and heart breaking moments. Hugh Jackman's cameo was alright.Personally, I really didn't enjoy this movie. Some bits were OK but it was dull and I was just bored throughout. 5/10"
" Ranks with the best in the X-Men franchise
",0.6369,0.9884,2017-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Released in 2016 and directed/co-written by Bryan Singer, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" has the team go up against the first mutant, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), whose origins date back to ancient Egypt. After thousands of years in stasis, Apocalypse is immediately disillusioned by the state of the world and so recruits a team of worthy mutants, including a dispirited Magneto (Michael Fassbender), to purge humanity and craft a new world order over which he will reign. Professor X (James McAvoy), with the assistance of Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), leads a team of young X-Men to stop their greatest nemesis and save mankind from complete destruction. Josh Helman is on hand as Col. Stryker.This sixth film in the franchise (not including the several spin off films) easily ranks as one of the best. It includes many of the best elements of the X-Men and everything I would want in a great X-Men flick:Professor X's ongoing goal for an educational sanctuary for interesting mutants from all over the world; his love for Moira (Rose Byrne); Magneto's increasing mastery of his great powers and his struggle to go on the offensive against prejudiced humanity; a greater focus on Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and his potent power, both of which were neglected in the original trilogy; an outstanding actress to play Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), who is far better than the bland Famke Janssen; Olivia Munn's ultra-hotness as Psylocke; a worthy subplot on Weapon X with the corresponding guest appearance of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman); an excellent collection of young mutants, like Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), Havok (Lucas Till), Angel (Ben Hardy), etc.; a worthy main villain in the mold of Dr. Doom and Thanatos; an epic, apocalyptic final act (sorry); I could go on and on.This isn't to say the movie doesn't have faults, however; the cartoony overblown prologue in ancient Egypt is Exhibit A.The film runs 144 minutes and was shot in Quebec, Canada (Greenfield Park, Montreal and Oka).GRADE: A-"
" ""A gift can often be a curse.""
",0.4404,0.8626,2017-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Anyone else wondering how a planet threatening entity like Apocalypse would be no larger than the average human/mutant that's part of his team? Maybe I've been conditioned by too many comic book covers, but I thought Apocalypse would be some Incredible Hulk sized behemoth. Seeing him along side Magneto, Storm, Psylocke and Angel, I almost had to laugh; where was the sheer, awesome, powerful fear his character should have generated? Well this one got by me somehow when it landed in the theaters last year, I'm still scratching my head over that. In general, I didn't think the film was too bad, not being a Marvel comics fan myself. One of the things I look for in a Marvel flick is the ubiquitous cameo appearance by creator and writer Stan Lee, and he didn't let me down. Lee is in a scene where he watches the launch of the nuclear missiles by Apocalypse, so his X-Men string of appearances remains unbroken. You know, the guy just turned ninety four his last birthday!! No pun intended, but the man is a marvel himself.The story here is packed with characters and I didn't have too much trouble keeping track of who's who. The stand out scene once again involved the Quicksilver (Evan Peters) mutant doing the Matrix-style save of fellow students during the destruction of Xavier's school. The only thing missing this time around was a catchy tune to go along with it, like the 'Time in a Bottle' number from ""Days of Future Past"".Having seen the 'Logan' movie a couple weeks ago, it seemed to me that Hugh Jackman might have been hanging up his Wolvie gig, but the after credits scene here seemed to suggest otherwise. I guess we'll have to wait and see, but it sure would seem to confuse the non-comic fan movie goer."

Awakened in 1983 after thousands of years in a deep slumber, he plans to rule the world and wipe out mankind with help from four new recruits Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Angel (Ben Hardy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender).Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has an issue with that, and alongside Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), and an array of younger X-Men, including Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), he looks to stop them.Plus Points:1)VFX: X-men Apocalypse is lot about destruction than intelligence.There are lot of heavy destruction scenes which are a treat for fans.VFX looked more cool in 3D.There are few pop out sequences especially during title credits and Angel's wing blades.But out of all,Quick Silver scored again with another mind blowing slow motion sequence.This may not be as best as DOFP but still it entertained.2)Performances: All the actors gave their best for their roles.Michael Fassbender and McAvoy once again shined.But the real show stealer is Sophie Turner,Evan Peters and Tye Sheridan.Jennifer Lawrence is not so blue here and looks lovely.3)Screenplay: Apocalypse is no such brain fodder like DOFP.This movie has clichéd screenplay but still it makes a entertaining one time watch.Audience never feels bored and good action scenes,humor and chemistry between all the actors played a key role in movie's engagement.Minus Points:1)Story: As I have said earlier,Apocalypse is a clichéd super hero film with a routine plot where a destruction master starts destructing everything and our heroes trying to stop destruction,,2)Weak Villain: Except having a deadly name Apocalypse looks more like a villain of Power Rangers series.I never expected such a weak antagonist in X-Men series especially after DOFP.So,X-Men Apocalypse disappoints those who became fans of X-Men series only because of DOFP.

" Somewhat bland and not as Interesting as its Predecessors
",-0.3089,-0.9776,2017-03-04 00:00:00,6,"X-Men: Apocalypse was one of the bigger blockbusters of last summer year. As many have noticed and withdrawn, the 3rd installment of this X-Men franchise. And this is arguably in retrospect the worst of the franchise. Without the presence of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), this film was both a box office disappointment and received its worst reviews out of the three X-Men films. One reason as to why this film isn't as good, is that the storyline is loaded with too many characters. The acting and characters are well portrayed as the actors are a good representation of the characters but they're are a few too many and scenes seem to split and go back and forth. As well as the main villain and title character: Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), the ancient Egyptian mutant god who has been resurrected in 1983. The villain isn't that well known and this character is not that interesting. His powers were far too simple and it felt as if it was cheating. There are some brief bits of action and some decent quality storyline, but as a whole this film is a disappointment compared to Days of Future Past and First Class. Also filled a predictable ending, the audience is left wondering that this really was it. ==================================================================== = ======= As for a rewatch 07/07/17' X-Men: Apocalypse remains the worst X-Men film of the new franchise, though it still does offer some decent scenes. Opinions remain same though one is more likened to the film after paying closer attention and on another viewing. It does not have the same spark and interest as Days of Future Past."
" ""At least we can agree that the third one is always the worst""
",-0.3818,0.9955,2017-03-02 00:00:00,5,"Michael Fassbender. Certainly one of the three best actors working today, an absolute force of raw emotional power and complexity. Any film can safely put it's faith on his shoulders, as he is the sort of actor that can single-handedly make a film work. With how little screen time he actually has in this film, I can't help but make the sad realization that the producers, writers, and Bryan Singer himself don't know who their best horse is. Every scene featuring Fassbender peaked my interest, as his performance alone carried me through the clunky writing. He's a star, and a film focused on him is the sensible direction to take this franchise, not pushing him into a corner. Let your stars shine, Fox.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't very good. There are a host of problems that plague it, but the most appalling would have to be the terribly confused storytelling. It's worth noting that this is the first X- Men film with an actual emphasis on the villain. In the past, it's always been focused on the Professor X/Magneto conflict, racial tension, the plight of being a mutant and other, more internal conflicts centered on coming to grips with mutants in society. Apocalypse, one of the X- Men's biggest foes, is an enormous presence to capture on film. I feel the film actually nailed the persona of Apocalypse, Isaac giving an intimidating, somewhat powerful performance and lending an astute physicality to him to establish that presence. What the film absolutely failed to do, however, is establish the sheer power of Apocalypse. A man who has existed for millenia, something of a god- figure whose power is virtually unlimited. He is immortal. I can't stress this enough, in the comics he is a damn force of nature, something the X- Men could really never hope to defeat in straight up battle. The film does not capture any of the profundity inherent with Apocalypse's past, really glossing over the fact that he has turned the wheel of civilization's past, allowed people's to rise and willed others to fall. He is God, always worshipped by the peoples of his time, seen as a divine power and feared as one as well. Apocalypse makes no effort to establish this deity dynamic, instead just making him out to be a sort of charismatic leader to whom conflicted mutants will flock. His powers are woefully undefined, and during the climactic fight, I couldn't help but wonder why he couldn't just snap his fingers and end it all. The final fight is fun, but very clumsily constructed and ultimately pretty drab. Multiple characters that are hyped throughout the film don't actually do anything, and the ""plans"" put in play make no sense what so ever. Character motivations feel derived from simply a desire to progress from point A to point B, not natural or authentic at all.Jennifer Lawrence is bad here. She sleepwalks through her role, and I really can't conceive why Singer decided to explore Mystique further. At this point, she seems to follow the same pattern in every film. It begins and she has little faith in humanity's tolerance of mutants, and she tends to be either a fringe figure or embedded within the villainous organization. Professor X and Beast proceed to reach out to her, convincing her of the merits of peace and instilling a hope within her for a better future. Regardless of plot progression, she always recedes back to her original state, pessimistic, kind of whiny and simplistically conflicted. She was compelling in Singer's original trilogy and I tolerated her in the first two entries within this trilogy, but at this point nothing new is added. Now I just wish they'd just leave her to her own devices, or at least give her a defined and confident worldview. She's not some all-powerful force that could endanger the entire world, nor is she a scared little child who knows little else. She's an adult woman, and she's made her choice. Can we move on?X-Men: Apocalypse, when it comes down to it, is a film of shallow delights. For the most part, I really enjoy the cast of these films. There's loads of starpower that generally aren't in these sort of stories, so it's a delight to see them hamming it up at heroes. I also was fascinated by half of the Apocalypse character, as I think some of his ideas play nicely with the general concerns of the X-Men franchise. Jean Grey is effectively constructed as a character, Cyclops, Nightcrawler and Quicksilver not as much. On even shallower level, I had quite a bit of fun with Olivia Munn as Psylocke, purely because she's attractive and I'm a guy. Magneto's time on screen was the film at it's best, and Singer's visual style as always is exemplary. Suffice to say, I had a good time with this film, despite it's overwhelming issues (hence my decent-good rating). I've been a comic-book nerd all my life and i don't see the personal utility in criticizing these sort of films, because on a basic level I appreciate them all. This film is not good, and if you are not at all a nerd in that way, you rightfully will hate this film. The writing is awful, direction scattered and the finished product just feels messy. It's a flailing effort to enter the traditional superhero film racket, with a narrative focused on a hero vs villain rather than heroes vs themselves, and it seems evident that this route may not be the best one. Apocalypse does not hold up to scrutiny at all, but the sad fact of life is that I will still see this three more times. I have more to say, but I feel bad trashing on this film, which I admittedly enjoyed quite a bit."
" Pretty Good but One MAJOR Downside
",0.1406,0.9928,2017-02-24 00:00:00,6,"The biggest downfall for me was easily the casting of Sophie Turner as Jean. Most of the time she has this dumbfounded look on her face. Sophie really brought nothing to arguably the most special X-Men character who I thought deserved A LOT more. Sophie didn't seem to understand the power and capabilities of Jean. The casting director has a lot to answer for. Famke Janssen who played Jean in 'The Last Stand' would have been a lot better.Storyline wasn't the best but pretty good. The movie gives good coverage to the story-lines of individual characters such as Cyclops, Magneto, Professor X, Nightcrawler, Mystique, and even a glimpse into Wolverine's re-birth. There were some pretty god awful cheesy-ass moments in the script that were more suited to a day-time soap opera than a blockbuster movie. SFX were very good as usual with these movies, and a fair amount of interesting camera angles with some really nice shots.I would have scored this movie an easy 8 or 8.5 had the role of Jean been given to someone better."

That resumes it all. If you take all the scores and have a score of seven or more you can be sure the movie isn't as bad as some negative critics want to make you believe. It might not be the best X-Men movie ever but it sure is entertaining enough to me. And the story isn't bad at all. Au contrary I thought the script was well written with a lot of action like we are used to. The characters are what they are. If you don't like superheroes then you should just not watch these kind of movies. There are plenty enough other movies to chose from if you're not into this genre. So let people that like this genre have a bit of fun and stop the unfounded negative reviews.
" The movie could have been better
",0.4404,-0.9399,2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"""Well, at least we can all agree, the third one's always the worst"" says Jean Grey (Speaking of Sophie Turner, isn't Sansa Stark ""the third"" child of Ned Stark in the books? But I digress.) First I want to talk about the things I really like in this movie.I like the idea of disarming the entire world of nuclear weapons. I know in the movie it's a preemptive strategy by the villain. But if you took it out of context, just imagine how much better the 21st century would be without nuclear weapons.Quicksilver is my favorite character because not only that cool slow-motion sequence but also his carefree, humorous personality. There's a scene where Quicksilver wakes up in a secret prison with Mystique and Beast (both are now in their blue-colored forms), he freaks out worrying he may become blue too. There are quite a few interesting comic relief scenes involving him. And I notice X-Men Quicksilver runs much faster than Age-of-Ultron Quicksilver, since Avengers Quicksilver is slower than (and is shot dead by) bullets.Now, Apocalypse. What exactly is the purpose of this character? He can kill normal people with sand and dust, but can't kill any of X-Men, and a few teenage mutants can kill him. What a great leader he is that he has a mighty army of 4 people (with 2 of the 4 turning against him). So they are just not that into you.Everything about Magneto is ridiculous. For example: For a dark soul like him, he would not choose to settle down with a family. He would leave his family like he left Quicksilver's mom. For a stubborn, obsessive, high-conflict personality like him, he would not just kill some factory workers hoping the person ratted him out was among them. He would want to find out that individual and look into his eyes while killing him. And why does Magneto choose Apocalypse to be his leader? I don't think Magneto likes to be told what to do. He would want himself to be the leader. And also, at the end of the movie, for no reason at all, he becomes a good citizen and helps Xavier. It doesn't make sense.I enjoy this movie, even though there are some plot flaws. Overall it's a good entertainment."

You have a lot more character to be shown. Its really a shame. We love these movie for these story line, not for the making.

Apart from that we also have a really good end sequence (action), that really helps the movie out. There are relationships and other things that get explored and people have to decide (not always on their own free will), for whom they want to fight. It's decent, but it's not really great"
" A good super hero and special effects movie
",0.9201,0.9941,2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"X-Men Apocalypse is typical of what you would expect from a Marvel X-Men movie. Light on story and depth and heavy on special effects and action. In short it is exactly what I, as a Science Fiction and Fantasy geek, would expect as well as hope for.The X-Men faces a new threat in the form of the worlds first mutant. Naturally said mutant is really a Übermutant vastly more powerful than any ""normal"" mutant. Equally naturally this Übermutant is set on a path of world destruction and domination. I quite liked this villain. He is a good all evil and powerful bad guy and a worthy adversary. No nonsense about trying to make the villain likable or trying to explain why he turned evil or such like. This guy is evil, he is the bad guy, he needs to be taken downfull stop.As I wrote the story is not the most elaborate one around but it is a good one within the confines of a Marvel super hero movie. It gets the job done without being overly stupid or silly. It is set in the ""prequel"" universe created by X-Men First Class. The movie adds a few new X-Men to the ranks of Professor Xaviers team. Some of them thanks to the manipulations of Apocalypse although they start out on the bad side at first.The movie moves along at a decent enough pace and, as was mentioned, there are quite a few action sequences and special effects thrown at the viewer throughout the movie. Personally I found the special effects to be quite good. Even stunning at times. I am quite a bit of a special effects nerd so of course this pleased me a lot.The movies ending certainly opens the door to future X-Men movies and I for sure would like to see the franchise continue. I very much enjoyed these almost two and a half hours in front of my TV set."
" One of the most generic comic book movies ever. And that's really saying something
",0.0,-0.9325,2017-01-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie is just awful generic garbage. The plot is so generic and forgettable that it infuriates any movie lover. There are some kind of cool moments but they ultimately have no impact on the arching story line.This movie is the most generic a film can be. Bad guy wants to destroy the world, the heroes try to stop him. That is literally the whole plot. It turns a menacing villain(apocalypse) and a good actor(Oscar Issac) into a humanoid blueberry with a grab bag of inconsistent abilities and very vague motives. The villain doesn't know the heroes and the heroes don't know the villain. There is no emotional weight at all and the audience is not invested in any of the characters. There is a somewhat emotional scene after Havoc(I think that's the guy who shoots lasers from his chest) dies. But it's ruined by a humorous Quicksilver scene right before it and a stupid scene where the teens are cracking jokes at the mall(oh and Jean Grey is right. The third movie is always the worst) which just cancels out any emotion created by Havoc's death. The performances are up and down throughout the movie. Macavoy and Fassbender are once again very good and Fassbender actually made me care when his family is killed(the only such moment in the movie). Jennifer Lawrence is just sleep walking through this movie for a paycheck and her mystique is so annoying(why is she leader of the x men? Isn't she evil?) The young X Men mostly give mediocre performances. Jean Grey was so robotic and her Phoenix thing at the end was very rushed and unnecessary. Cyclops was a rebel only for the sake of comedy even though he is supposed to be the mature leader. Quicksilver was cool but they totally butchered the whole magneto is his son subplot. And all the other characters are just very bland. The other three horseman don't say anything and just stand there and do nothing. Overall, I would say that this movie is totally a franchise killer and destroys any momentum it had after Days of Future Past. Don't ever watch this movie."

",0.0,0.7679,2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"What I did not like about X-Men: Apocalypse mostly points towards the Apocalypse character. Now I haven't follow X-Men since The Executioners Song story so I don't know how the Apocalypse character was treated since then but they completely ruined the character. The actor who played him was annoying, cock-eyed, big-nosed and completely unconvincing as an evil God. And his powers were stupid. I remember Apocalypse having the power to shape shift his body into weapons which was the primary appeal of the character. But he's can just manipulate **** to whatever he wants and has good fashion taste. This, of course, made the fight scenes with him a little disappointing. Among other things, the movie moved a little too slow but not all that bad. What I did like about the movie was the story, the action, and some of the acting. My favorite scene was with Wolverine slashing people to death. Yes, I have no intelligence for this and guess what: I don't care what you think. The story was good but nothing more than that. I liked most of the action but felt the final action scene was less than stellar. And the acting was good. The chick who played Mystique has a nice ***! URGH!In conclusion: Next to The Last Stand, my least favorite of the X-Men movie franchise but it was able to maintain its entertainment value for me."
" Everyone's invited to the ""Apocalypse,"" a clunkier but still enjoyable ""X-Men"" film
",0.5927,0.9957,2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"After ""Days of Future Past"" bridged together the two generations of big screen X-Men into an epic time-travel blockbuster, it didn't leave a whole lot of ceiling for future ""X- Men"" movies. Nevertheless, 20th Century Fox, director Bryan Singer and writer Simon Kinberg were quick to deliver ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" bringing the X-Men's biggest villain to life. ""Apocalypse"" takes place in the early '80s in the (cleverly) revised ""X-Men"" timeline. All is rather quiet on the mutant-human front: Professor X (James McAvoy) has the school up and running, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) isn't getting into too much trouble and even Erik leads a peaceful new life in Poland. But when the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur a.k.a. Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is awakened from basically a really long nap, it has a seismic impact that sends the X-Men and humanity on a crash course for annihilation.A host of familiar characters return in the form of fresh young faces as the new ""X-Men"" universe inches closer to the first version. This includes Jean Gray (Sophie Turner), Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) for the good guys and Angel (Ben Hardy), Psylocke (Oliva Munn) and even Storm (Alexandra Shipp) as mutants recruited by Apocalypse to serve as his ""horsemen,"" of which Magneto somewhat reluctantly becomes the fourth. Although ""Days of Future Past"" was pretty crowded with characters too, the story kept things compartmentalized and manageable, not to mention most of them had already been introduced in previous films. ""Apocalypse,"" however, must balance them all within one story, and it requires lots of little scenes that jump around from character to character. Kinberg does a better job at this than he did back when he wrote ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" a movie he takes a not-so-subtle jab at in one random but funny scene, but the story becomes similarly unhinged.As an all-powerful villain bent on wiping the earth clean of non-mutants, Apocalypse has the potential to be both really intimidating and cause a number of plausibility issues. Both side of that coin come into play in ""Apocalypse,"" but neither side is particularly nuanced, so the intellectual component that the ""X-Men"" franchise has done very well at times practically no-shows here. Some emotion weaves its way into the movie to varying degrees of effectiveness, particularly in individual character side stories, but physicality, visual effects and spectacle end up at the forefront of the viewing experience.The script does a good job showcasing the many characters and their talents and figuring out how to close as many holes in logic as possible (i.e. ""if that characters does 'X' couldn't that other character use their powers to do 'Y'?"") and Singer makes those clashes compelling. He's always had a good vision for this franchise and keeps ""Apocalypse"" focused and engaging enough, even when the top has been blown off and the frame becomes 99 percent CGI in the final act. Most importantly, Singer always makes sure the characters don't get lost in the chaos, which makes ""Apocalypse"" definitively better than ""The Last Stand,"" even if it is probably Singer's poorest job of sticking to his mantra. In a series that's had a lot of high points, it's not hard for ""Apocalypse"" to default into one of the lesser ""X-Men,"" but it's completely watchable and satisfying.The future of ""X-Men"" on the silver screen is a bit hazy given contracts for its big stars, but ""Apocalypse,"" in all its mayhem, restores the equilibrium that offset by ""Days of Future Past"" and the ripple effect it had on the main characters. It was a good ripple, but future installments should be able to stand a bit more on their own from now on and that's a good sign.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
" Not Up To EXpectations
",0.0,0.955,2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"In the lead up to the release of X Men Apocalypse I was aware that there was going to be an uphill struggle coming of the back of First Class and Days of Future Past, two films that I consider to be masterpieces while this is not a bad film it's not all that great and I was very disappointed. However there is still plenty of good in this film, all the performances in this film are all still as good, James McAvoy adds a more experienced and wiser aspect to his Xavier this time around, Fassbender gives the greatest performance in this film he is such a damaged person in this film and it really added to his character motivations and arc. Oscar Isaac was really good in this film he was very menacing and sunk himself right into the character. I liked seeing all of the original characters back together as younger versions they all were fun characters who were close to their future selves. The relationship between Xavier and Eric has been a major crutch of the last two films and this one doesn't focus on it as much but when it does it's done just as well. The eventual final fight against Apocalypse was great, much more epic in scale than the other films in the franchise, the cerebral aspect of Xavier fighting Apocalypse inside his mind was brilliantly executed and the set up for Dark Phoenix was done very well. Quicksilver is back again, just as good as he was in Days of Future Past, it was nice to see him get an expanded role in this film and merged perfectly into the team. My biggest issues with this film come from the script, the films pacing is pretty awful, most of the first half is just set up for the rest of the film and did bore me quite a bit and times. Apocalypse was also not a very good villain, his motivations were extremely conventional, his powers were never fleshed out and his suit was terrible. All the villains except for Magneto are just throw away thugs essentially who add nothing to the plot of this film. The cameo from Wolverine itself was amazing to see but you get the hint that the entire strikers island sequence was done just for that cameo. In terms of spectacle, visuals and performances this film is brilliant but the script was this films major downfall, it's pacing is terrible, the villains are bland with no real motivation and fails to build on and improve plot threads and character developments that were set up in the past films. 69%/B-"
" Major step back from Days of Future Past
",0.0,-0.6817,2017-01-09 00:00:00,4,"OK, so let me just say first of all: this film was not a disaster.However, compared to the previous installment in this series, this film fails in a number of areas. Most notably, tonal inconsistency and continuity.I'll just point out one thing for starters. This film takes place in 1983. First Class takes place in 1962. 21 years have passed in this timeline and no one has aged a bit. Well, they made McAvoy bald, but that's about it.The tone of this film is all over the place. For example, the school is about to be blown to smithereens and then all of a sudden, Quicksilver arrives and saves everyone in a whimsical fashion completely contrasting the gravity of the previous situation.When it comes to the villain, there is nothing remarkable about Apocalypse. He did not stand out for me at all. His ""henchmen"" are completely forgettable and there was no impact at all.When it came to casting, I was incredibly skeptical of characters like Cyclops and Jean Grey being recast as teenagers. I'm sure people were excited to see Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark) as Jean Grey, but oh boy, her performance wasn't the best.Jennifer Lawrence is another actor whose performance I have to criticize. She was definitely phoning it in here. Her delivery was so monotonous half the time that the relatability was just out the window. She probably thought, ""I'm too big of a star for these silly comic book films"".The plot had no weight, ultimately because all these comic book films are so predictable these days, that you know they're just gonna play it safe for extra sequels. So no casualties, meaning no stakes."
" The 3rd movie is no longer the worst.
",-0.743,-0.9521,2017-01-05 00:00:00,1,"If I knew nothing about the X-Men, this would be a noisy, illogical waste of time and money. For X-Men fans, like myself, it is a supreme disappointment. The previous two movies were fun and focused on characters, but here good actors don't even get to play scenes together. I am not convinced Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are ever in a studio together. X-Men Apocalypse reminds me of the 3rd Star Wars prequel, which is so busy trying to connect the dots of how we get from X-Men First Class to X-Men 1, there is no movie there. Who cares how Charles lost his hair? What I want to know is why Storm is so useless on screen. She could barely beat Toad in the first movie and here she barely conjures a breeze and a few lightning bolts. About another dozen X-Men are mostly wasted too. How about just introducing a few at a time instead of all at once.It is pretty arrogant that Bryan Singer includes a (spoiler) inside joke about the 3rd movie always being the worst and yet, this movie takes a major plot point (spoiler) from Superman IV (for all the kids out there who don't remember, that is the worst). This movie is tiring, tedious, and ultimately not even exciting."
" Surprisingly great
",0.743,0.984,2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,Seeing a lot of reviews for this film I really wasn't expecting much however this film is surprisingly great. Being a fan of the x-men films in general I found this to be one of the best due to the way the ensemble was used. It was great to see James McAvoy again and Michael Fassbender put in an excellent performance especially when his family are killed bringing him into the fray once again. The newcomers were great as well with Tye Sheridan's Cyclops and Kodi Smit Mcphees Nightcrawler as stand-outs. Apocalypse himself was a good villain however I wish he'd been given a bit more to do and I didn't find his design all that great. Standout scenes would be the slow-mo Quicksilver sequence and the weapon X cameo. Overall this is a great chapter in the X-men saga and should not be overlooked.
" Oh Dear!
",0.4389,-0.6125,2017-01-01 00:00:00,4,"X-Men has been a massive money spinner for Marvel, so I guess its no surprise that they keep churning stories out like sausages. This movie is no better and not really any worse than any of the others; had it been released first then I am sure I would be giving it a much more flattering review. There is nothing in this movie to add depth of understanding of any of the characters. In fact there were no new ideas whatsoever. I can't blame the producers for sticking to a formula that works, but I feel a little ripped off by repeated themes and story construction. This lazy effort has killed it for me. If the writers don't try to find new material and new direction and develop characters and perhaps throw in a few really gritty stomach churning twists then they are unlikely to get me to watch, much less buy the next one."
