" Nice action-comedy
",0.4215,0.9246,2021-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Considering the action-comedy subcategory, ""Keeping Up with the Joneses"" does its job pretty well. Entertaining and enjoyable (but don't expect too much). Gal Gadot does have an impressive screen presence."
" Very good...
",0.0,0.9856,2021-03-09 00:00:00,8,"How cute, I was surprised, it's not just another boring and boring comedy, the play was captivating the protagonists and supporting actors captivate us, and the antagonists are caricatures, but necessary, the characters are attractive, clumsy and sincere, intelligent and fun script, cliché but passionate, the jokes work, the tone of mystery and suspense catches our attention, with a lot of humor and a lot of action..."
" Quite predictable
",0.0,0.939,2021-02-27 00:00:00,6,It is quite easy where this film was going for most of it. We could see Zak and Isla having to team up with the Joneses and them not really being dead. Very predictable story telling. Also an unrealistic and uninformed view of what HR people do. It is still a fun and very easy watch where you don't have to be fully engaged. Despite a decent cast their lack of chemistry and not enough humour could have improved the film
" Entertaining and Fun
",0.7351,-0.4003,2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Very tongue in cheek, and a bit of a parody on espionage/spy thrillers that somehow we are supposed to take seriously.
The four characters all bounce of one another well, and Jon Hamm is always worth watching (how I miss Mad Men!)
For some reason I kept imaging Rhys Darby in the role of Jeff Gaffney and Jodie Comer in the role of Natalie Jones."
" Amusing, but doesn't quite reach the level of funny
",0.6386,0.9153,2021-01-06 00:00:00,6,"Keeping Up with the Joneses is amusing, but it never quite reaches the level of funny. Despite the fact that Isla Fisher, Zach Galifianakis, and Jon Hamm have all proven their comedy chops before, none of them are really able to shine in this movie. It's an interesting concept with a completely predictable story and-much like my quiet, introverted neighbors-I'll probably forget about it soon."
" Fun, funny, good movie overall
",0.8442,0.8553,2020-11-13 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this movie, can i say it's a solid cast? An okay storyline and fun dialogues."
" Great fun !!
",0.8395,0.8355,2020-11-04 00:00:00,7,"Really enjoyable escapist flick. Fantastic cast, silly story but who cares ?! All action and no effing and blinding for a change.I'd watch it again for sure"
" Simple but funny...
",0.0,0.9967,2020-10-16 00:00:00,6,"""Keeping Up with the Joneses"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch a couple living in the suburbs peacefully when some new neighbors move in their neighborhood. The new neighbors have something to hide and they have also many secrets which they want to remain hidden.I liked this movie because I found it very funny, it had a simple but interesting plot and some very good interpretations by its cast. The direction which was made by Greg Mottola was good and he presented very well the characters. He did an excellent on keeping the plot simple and promoting the characters and their interpretations. In addition to this, the interpretations of both Zach Galifianakis who played as Jeff Gaffney and Isla Fisher who played as Karen Gaffney were very good, funny and along with the interpretations of Gal Gadot who played as Natalie Jones and Jon Hamm who played as Tim Jones they made this movie even funnier but also more balanced. Finally, I have to say that ""Keeping Up with the Joneses"" is a nice, funny movie to watch and spend your time with and I highly recommend it to everyone."
" Really entertaining!

" Grindingly boring
",-0.3182,-0.5719,2020-08-05 00:00:00,1,"Rather than prime cuts, the meat they've put into the grinder is offal. They turn the handle slowly and steadily and what comes out is consistently inedible. (It really is that unappetizing.)Not a single character to care about and such a tired non-story. What a waste of everyone's time."
" Gal Gadot is 🔥
",0.0,0.9427,2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,"I'm not going to judge people on their ratings but maaaan they deserve to get higher ratings. This movie doesn't mainly focus on spying, this is comedy. I must confess that the reason I watched this movie is when I saw Gal Gadot playing darts and killing the game, I was like yes she's gonna show us how it's done! Well played Gal, well played. She is the one I wanna see more often in the movies."
" So-so - but better than staring at a blank TV
",0.5927,0.8844,2020-05-24 00:00:00,5,"Another ""comedy"" with the weird-looking, socially stunted, dorky, NOT rich guy married to the smart hot chick. Sure - that happens ALL THE TIME in real life. A comedy staple since the Honeymooners. I didn't get the appeal of Jackie Gleason and I don't get the appeal of Zach Whatever. But I did love the line by the spies about surviving 10 years in 30 countries but they couldn't last a week in the suburbs."
" Exactly what you expect, which isn't such a bad thing.
",0.431,0.9941,2020-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Keeping Up with the Joneses is built on a plot trope that I have always enjoyed. You take a bumbling every man, and then you pair him with a slick super spy. However, in this one we have a bumbling couple paired up with a super spy couple. It still works, and might be even funnier because of it. I will admit, if you've seen one of these movies, then there won't be a ton of surprises for you along the way. Even some of the jokes are predictable because we know how things go when a shlubby guy tries to act cool, and yet they still made me laugh. The reason I think Keeping Up with the Joneses worked so well for me was the cast. Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot are perfect as the elite agents with a slight sense of humor. Likewise, Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher do a great job of bringing the comedy as the stuck-in-a-rut suburban couple. I also think it helped that they established Isla Fisher's character as someone who is highly suspicious and a nosy neighbor, so it makes sense that she starts to figure things out quickly.As with any glamorized spy film like this one, you have to accept that Keeping Up with the Joneses is a bit far-fetched and silly. If you spend too much time trying to justify the logic of how or why things are happening, you'll just get annoyed. Plus, this film has the added layer of comedy making things even more ridiculous. However, I do think the story about what brings them together is a bit weak. It almost seems that they should have spent a little more time working through some of the details so that everything made sense. The extra time also would have been good to better develop the friendship bond between Galifianakis and Hamm. It's not often that I think a movie could have been longer, but this is one of those cases. Otherwise, I found Keeping Up with the Joneses to be a solid movie that knew what it was trying to be and succeeded at delivering good action with some laughs. If you watch the trailer and think it looks like fun, you'll probably be happy with what the movie delivers."
" A time passer
",0.0,0.8519,2020-03-11 00:00:00,5,"The movie is a one off time passer. Some funny scenes, and funny one liners. It's not a typical movie which you'd enjoy and want to watch it again. Once is enough."
" Funny and Kind Acting
",0.743,0.6989,2020-02-16 00:00:00,6,"It's better than expected. There are plenty of secret agent comedies. This one is about a married couple, discovering that their new neighbours are secret agents. That's a scenario, that can fail easily, but didn't. I like how the actors did their part to make the difference feel authentic. The story is a little simple, but for some funny moments that movie was ok to watch. Recommendation for rainy days."
" Adult Content; Funny
",0.4404,0.8268,2020-01-24 00:00:00,8,This is a funny movie that is great for adults. Some of the material is inappropriate for children and even for high schoolers. There is one scene near the beginning that is crude and unnecessary for the plot of the movie. The acting is great and the plot keeps you on your toes!
" Classic ""intrigue"" comedy
",0.3612,0.9676,2020-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Reminiscent of the old Chevy Chase comedies. Love Ham as a straightman in this fun movie. Isla Fischer is the best, We all need to laugh more these days, good for the blood pressure, ey?!"
" A Comedy
",0.3612,0.9062,2020-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Comedies are comedies are comedies. I like them all really, or at least the popular ones with a decent cast. This is the same.A good Zach Galifinakis movie. I also really like Isla Fisher, she's very unique. Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot are kind of annoying, but still cool in this movie. I don't think Gadot is there yet, she's too foreign.The movie was decent though. I really enjoyed the family aspect, and the action kind of took out of the movie. I didn't enjoy the action aspect, if it didn't have it I'd probably rate it higher.5 stars"
" Still laughing!
",0.5411,0.8901,2020-01-06 00:00:00,8,The actors in this movie are very good and very believable. I like these kind of spoof movies when they work. This one works very well my whole family laughs every time we see it.
" Good story but the script was cringe worthy om occasion
",0.7003,0.9372,2019-12-08 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed this despite its obvious flaws. Poor Zach Galafinakis is lumped with trying to make a really annoying chatacter likeable. He just about manages it despite some terrible bumbling dialogue. Most of the cast do well with the material and it's entertaining enough, if very silly. Some stuff is truly awful, like the wives in the changing room scene. It ticks along quickly enough and was fairly harmless fun."
" Bruce Sprinstein
",0.0,0.5423,2019-12-01 00:00:00,5,"Its like its been written by a 13 year old boy, with lots of cheap jokes and predictable story."
" Life in the Suburbs
",0.0,0.9253,2019-10-17 00:00:00,6,"""Jeff Gaffney"" (Zach Galifianakis) is an employee who works in human resources at a computer chip manufacturer in Los Angeles and lives on a cul-de-sac in the suburbs with his wife ""Karen Gaffney"" (Isla Fisher). Life for him is both good-and rather predictable-from one day to the next. But such is life in suburbia. Then one day everything changes when an attractive couple by the names of ""Tim Jones"" (Jon Hamm) and ""Natalie Jones"" (Gal Gadot) move in across the street and become the focus of everybody in the neighborhood-especially the Gaffneys. And before they know it they are drawn into a world of high-stakes international espionage that they never thought was possible. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fun film for the most part which was limited to an extent by the standard clichés and predictability of the plot. Even so, there was some decent humor here and there with good acting performances from everyone and for that reason I have rated this movie accordingly. Slightly above average."
" Unfair review
",-0.4767,0.9651,2019-10-12 00:00:00,8,"Anybody that says this movie is just a by the numbers dull comedy must have seen a different movie than I did. It wasn't a laugh per minute kind of movie, it was a funny action flick with a little bit of drama mixed in that actually had some genuine emotion to it. I think the casting for this movie was perfect, they all portrayed exactly what their characters roles were perfectly for the lead actors, even all the supporting cast did a decent job selling the characters they were playing. If you want to see an above average comedy action movie this movie is pretty good."
" Disaster
",-0.6249,-0.8689,2019-10-06 00:00:00,2,"OMG, what a waste of time! Not funny, full of the same very old cliche lines, no action, just dragging on the entire time. I gave it 2 stars, just for those scenes with Gal trying on lingerie...and that is sad."
" Isla adds va-va-voom to this otherwise unexceptional caper.
",0.0,0.961,2019-08-09 00:00:00,7,"Comedy/thriller Keeping Up With The Joneses isn't very funny and not all that thrilling, the 'spies next door' plot offering very little in the way of originality, and so for many the film will prove a disappointment. Fans of Isla Fisher, on the other hand, will come away more than satisfied: she is absolutely gorgeous here, flaunting her curvaceous body in several steamy scenes. She's so hot that she manages to upstage Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot (nine years her junior), who looks like a malnourished stick insect by comparison. Sacha Baron Cohen, you jammy bugger!Let's do a quick summary of the Fisher-goodness...In a dream sequence, Karen Gaffney (Fisher) appears in a sheer negligee studying a sex manual. Zoinks!Having been cornered by Natalie Jones (Gadot) in the lingerie department at Bloomingdales, Karen buys a set of sexy underwear (basque, stockings and suspenders) which she wears for her lucky husband Jeff (Zach Galifianakis). Sweet baby Jesus!Going undercover to liaise with arms dealer Scorpion (Patton Oswalt), Karen slips into a figure-hugging silver dress that accentuates her impressive cleavage. Holy Mother of God!Karen snogs Gadot (the scene that made me want to watch this in the first place). Arooga!Wearing said dress, Karen leaps out a hotel window and lands in a swimming pool. Wet Fisher... hubba hubba!4/10 for the film. 10/10 for Isla. That averages out at 7/10."

" Gal Gadot Makes My Body Rock She's A Miracle From Heaven, I Mean Israel
",0.7964,0.9988,2019-07-14 00:00:00,5,"Joe Ham and Zachariah Galifianakisis are really funny too. I love those guys. This' so good. I will definitely be Keeping Up with Mrs. Jones/Gal Gadot/Wonder Woman/Diana Prince/Miss Israel/the new & improved HOTTEST WOMAN wonder OF ALL-TIME! Eat your heart out world. Seeing Gal Gadot smile is like being on a sweet vacation. Seeing sweet Gal in her incredibly sexy black lingerie in this is bliss, pure bliss. Isla Fisher's really sweet too and her underwear scene's just as hot really. Oooo Myyy g Gal & Isla's underwear scenes are so hot and so funny too! I love Gal & Isla & Jon & Zach. Gal is fat, well Gal-ifianakis that is. Gal Gadot has the most unreal body I've ever seen! She's perfect! Gal Gadot makes my body rock she's a miracle from heaven I love her and I want to be with her. I love Gal Gadot! Bad plot, good Gadot. This movie's really funny and good to watch. Thanks to Gal. The decision to cast Patton Oswalt as the Scorpion best sums up the 5 rating. I love Gal Gadot. I love it when Gal & Isla kiss during the end climax, and what a climax it is! It makes me happy. I love KUwtJ and Gal Gadot!"

" Delivers on Silly and Absurd
",0.0258,0.948,2018-05-10 00:00:00,7,"This movie is predictable as hell, but I didn't exactly watch Keeping up the Joneses to be surprised by brilliant twists and turns. One method of comedy is to blatantly set up things in order to pay them off in a silly way, and this did plenty of that. The performances in it by all four leads - Zach Galifanakas, Isla Fischer, Jon Hamm, and Gal Gadot - were fantastic. They were fully committed to the absurdity."
" good, not great.
",-0.1012,0.9565,2018-04-21 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed it, but I'm glad I waited until it was free ondemand instead of watching it in the theaters. I like the cast list. Basically, as funny as expected."
" Gal Gadot in lingerie is the best part of this movie
",0.6369,0.5574,2018-04-04 00:00:00,4,"There, I said it. If you wanna look for laugh, look some place else."
" surprising foursome
",0.2732,0.9408,2018-03-17 00:00:00,6,"In suburban Atlanta, married couple Jeff (Zach Galifianakis) and Karen Gaffney (Isla Fisher) drop off their sons for the summer camp. They have a temporary empty nest. Tim (Jon Hamm) and Natalie Jones (Gal Gadot) move into the neighborhood. They are exotic, friendly, beautiful, super-skilled, and overly interested in Jeff's workplace.This has a certain fun with the foursome together. They have a nice comedic chemistry. Isla Fisher is probably too cute and beautiful. Her character needs to be the opposite of Gal Gadot although the height difference with Wonder Woman is quite funny during the lingerie scene. Isla is a pretty funny comedic actress which helps a lot. There are ways to push this harder but it does hold back. Galifianakis could have been more dead pan wacky. While the four actors do good work together, the premise and the writing adds little new to the genre."
" Excellent, entertainment!
",0.7777,0.3828,2018-01-15 00:00:00,9,Fast paced timely action with great comedic moments littered all throughout this gem of a movie.I can't believe some of the low ratings...must be people with absolutely no sense of humor whatsoever....people you'd never invite to a party or any social event.
" Not great but better than the 34 on Metacritic
",-0.6435,0.9597,2018-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Midsize PG comedies swinging for a double never seem to get any love from critics. Sure trifles like ""Keeping Up with the Joneses"" won't leave you in stitches but it has its moments. Most of the moments come from jokes related to Zach Galifianakis' skills as an HR professional coming in handy when dealing with ruthless thugs. Also, the friend dynamic between the always eminently watchable John Hamm playing with type as a hyper-confident man's man and the sensitive Jeff Gaffney. They both have a genuine character development arc and learn from the relationship. Some of the dialog and action sequences brings some real laughs and some real pathos but, no, none of it is a home run. In short, if you don't expect to much you might not be let down with this modest outing."
" Bullet Ripping Comedy
",0.3612,0.9358,2017-11-23 00:00:00,6,"I am a big fan of Jon Hamm (Madmen). Michael LeSieur (writer of You,Me, And Dupree) came up with this comedy script about violent means to an end -A suburban couple get into an international espionage plot when they discover that their seemingly perfect new neighbors are government spies. Hamm's Tim Jones is perfectly dead panned straight man with the uber good looking Gal Gadot as wife Natalie Jones, a tall couple of spies who move into a suburb home next to Jeff (Zach Galifianakis) and Karen Gaffney (Isla Fisher). There can be no doubt the couples are physically appealing. Patton Oswalt is Scorpion, who helps make life complicated for everyone. While the film has a lot of action and is pretty lively, the jokes often physical in nature just miss the mark sometimes. There are moments which come close to being inspired but the action stuff being outrageous often gets the feeling of being done before. One thing done here that comes close to porn films but for humor is a little making out between Gadot and the shorter Fisher which comes close to getting steamy hot. That kind of says it all about this one. I like Hamm so I'd watch it again, but a classic film,umm...no but at least it connects the dots and keeps you awake better than some films I'd prefer to snore through."
" Not central intelligence
",-0.3724,0.8803,2017-10-08 00:00:00,3,"Keeping Up with the Joneses is a predictable fish out of water spy romp which is derivative of other similar films and add nothing much more in comedy or action.Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher are Jeff and Karen, a suburban couple. Jeff works in Human Resources for a government contractor and both have time for themselves as the kids have gone to summer camp.Suddenly moving next door and paid for the house in cash is a new young couple, Tim (Jon Hamm) and Natalie (Gal Gadot) who show an interest in the couple especially Jeff's work.It turns out the Jones are spies and Jeff and Karen are roped into their mission which includes finding someone leaking information from Jeff's company. This is rather easy to guess as several of his friends borrow Jeff's computer to go online as he is the only one in his company to have access to the internet because he is not regarded important enough.The plot is thin and gets messier it goes along. At one time we have to believe that Jeff cannot instantly recall a guy who he once dealt with for his personnel issues and went by the name of Bruce Springstine."

While Jeff bonds with Tim (Jon Hamm) as only Jeff can, Karen tails the exotic Natalie (Gal Gadot).This is an action comedy well written and executed.

",-0.0772,-0.9281,2017-08-18 00:00:00,3,"Am I the only one who has those moments during movies or shows that characters just anger you so much because of their stupidity even when you know and understand that the whole idea of that character is too be stupid and clueless? This is basically the epitome of that sort of story. It's just 2 hours of Fisher and Galafinakis doing exactly what they shouldn't do at all time. Hamm says don't turn around and Zach turns around. Hamm says ""duck!"" and Zach says ""where?"" even though there are people chasing them and trying to murder them. I know, this is stupid to get mad at. But It's honestly just infuriating to watch."
" POORLY written
",0.0,-0.9638,2017-08-07 00:00:00,2,"This is film is a great example of how a movie with a well-respected director and a well-respected cast can turn out awful due to an incompetent writer. Director Greg Mottola (""Superbad"") and actors Zach Galifianakis (""The Hangover""), Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers""), Jon Hamm (""Bridesmaids"") and Gal Gadot (""Wonder Woman"") are all dragged down by writer Michael LeSieur, who had previously dragged down the Russo Brothers, Owen Wilson, Kate Hudson, Matt Dillon, and Michael Douglas in ""You, Me, and Dupree.""From the very beginning, the film is set to either annoy or put viewers to sleep. The acting is for the most part atrocious. Isla Fisher seems to be the only one who's even trying. When she finds out that her neighbors are spies, her subsequent freak-outs are very convincing, while Galifianakis' subsequent freak-outs are very forced. This unfortunately means two things. 1) Fisher and Galifianakis do NOT have good on screen chemistry, and 2) The fact that Fisher's the only one legitimately freaking out indicates that LeSieur intended for her character to be a female Nicolas Cage. That's pretty insulting to my intelligence, considering that Isla Fisher can actually act and Nicolas Cage can't (at least not anymore). As for Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot, they are beyond wooden. End of story.And the plot? How did this screenplay even get green-lighted? Having the kids on screen but not giving them any dialogue or character development? Making all of the male characters except Jon Hamm low-IQ beta males? Confusing a corset with lingerie and as a result making Isla Fisher's seduction scene much less sexier than it could've been? Having the boss of a major arms company assassinated and then acting like nothing happened? Having another neighbor be a bad guy for no reason? Having Pat Oswalt degrade his resume by playing an arms dealer who's a bad guy because of a parking spot dispute and is not at all funny, when the film is supposed to be a comedy? Throwing in slow- motion romantic moments at the weirdest times possible? This film is a MESS. The only reason I consider it worth seeing and give it two stars instead of one is because Isla Fisher, my favorite actress, is in it, and she's actually trying. If you're not an Isla Fisher fan, SKIP this movie."

I watched it once and then again a few hours later, someone came home and wanted to watch it and I was actually okay with watching twice in a few hours.

Compared to those films, Keeping Up with the Joneses doesn't make me that laughed out loud like the other films did. But I really like the act from Zach Galifianakis. He has a comedy sense that get me. Also Gal Gadot plays made me cant take off my eyes of her. She is just amazing and good at being spy and good at shooting. The plot is very good, the comedy is not very hard funny but still entertaining to watch at your home. summary I'm entertained of this film."

Its jokes are not gonna make someone laughing and rolling on the floor at the same time. But its a movie that is funny and enjoyable enough to make one feel like...'Meh, it was alright' The 75% of the main cast is very attractive. So I must say this is easy on eyes. On the other hand acting of the cast wasn't that great. More than often it felt average and the attractiveness would help swallow some of the bad stuffs happening on the screen.This is a movie no one would watch for a second time(except for those Gadot fans).

",0.0762,0.9558,2017-07-20 00:00:00,6,"'Keeping up with the Joneses' isn't that hard to keep up with, but it is fun. Not the funniest film ever written, nor is it the most original, but then, it's not trying to be. This movie knows what it is and knows what it's not and plays its hand beautifully. Isla Fisher's character is easily the most interesting while Gal Gadot's is the funniest. The males are dry and uninspired, one too suave and Bond- like while secretly hating his job, the other a bumbling idiot that tries too hard to get laughs from the audience. The screenwriters didn't delve into their vaults for anything of value when penning this script and could have worked a little harder to have the film keep up with you. Nothing here will stay with you forever but there are worse ways to spend an afternoon. 6/10"
" DOA but better than Rogue One
",0.3256,-0.9727,2017-07-17 00:00:00,3,"Typical suburban husband and wife, Jeff and Karen Gaffney (Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher) meet incredible new neighbors Tim and Natalie Jones (Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot). Of course, Tim and Natalie are not the typical suburban couple, because they appear on the movie poster holding guns over the words ""License to Kill."" Jeff and Karen figure this out a few minutes into the movie.Shootings, car chases, explosions. Action. But no surprises. No tension, no drama. And comedy without humor. It is a comedy, after all, so the lack of humor kind of kills the whole thing.Galifianakis is an idiot through the entire thing. I suppose some people might laugh at idiocy. Fisher goes back and forth. Most of the time, she's an idiot. But occasionally she's not.Hamm and Gadot aren't idiots, but they're neither dramatic nor comedic. They're not given great lines. But, really, they're just not good enough, they don't have enough charisma, to carry a role. To be fair, it looks like the actors have the innate talent. I'd blame the director more than anyone.There's a pointless brief but noticeable pause, when Jeff has made an important discovery that he really must tell someone, but he's not telling anyone, for no particular reason. There are numerous things that sort of happen, but you know can't really have happened, and then immediately you find out that they really didn't happen. There's a scene that has no point to be in the movie except to set up a car chase. That's basically how the whole movie goes. And then they just wrap it up and the movie is over.Three stars because, while it isn't good, it isn't offensively bad. For example, it's infinitely better than Rogue One. At least with this movie, it's supposed to be a comedy, so it's understandable that they don't care so much if things don't make sense, because all they're trying to do is be funny. And it's understandable that they don't care so much about character development, because all they're trying to do is be funny. I mean, the minimum is 1 star for the worst $#1t. This movie gets an additional 1 star for Gal Gadot in lingerie for 15 minutes for no reason except to have Gal Gadot in lingerie (Rogue One doesn't get that star). And 1 more star for being not the worst thing I've ever seen (Rogue One doesn't doesn't get that star either)."

It has a few quite funny scenes and doesn't become an utter farce.The 4 leads Zach Galifianakis, Isla Fisher, Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot are well-cast and have pretty good chemistry together. I think I most surprised on how restrained Zach's performance is. It was almost as if the director reigned him but despite that he still has a few funny moments.There's much worse comedies out there which is about how high my praise is going to get for this movie. If you're wondering if it's awful, it's not. If you're wondering if it's great, it's not. A fairly dumb plot with good acting and thin character motivations.

The two couples' chemistry makes this movie perfectly enjoyable, but it is a shame that with such a great cast it wasn't developed to its full potential.With better writing this could easily be as funny as 'Get Smart' with Steve Carell or 'Johnny English'; the characters are likable and there are definitely some entertaining and amusing action scenes.Almost there but always restricted by the plot, 'Keeping up with the Joneses' is a watchable comedy spy film, the type of movie that you'd enjoy if it were on the TV but not actively search out."

But the movie wants us to understand that the story isn't merely about obviously extraordinary people and about ordinary people who rise to the occasion. The ordinary guy has talents too. He's in human resources, and it's not a job that gets him much respect but he knows how to connect and communicate with people. His people skills are something the undercover neighbors are lacking, and so each pair of neighbors can learn from the other. That's a nice point for a movie to make-- that they also serve who never leave their desks, and that everyone's approach to life can use some rounding out."

Probably my very favorite thing about this movie is the cast. The cast consists of Isla Fisher, Zach Galifianakis, Gal Gadot, and Jon Hamm. Zach and isla have awesome chemistry as an on screen pair, the same goes for Jon and Gal. Their performances are all on point, Zach and Isla are great at delivering the witty comedic dialogue and Gal and Jon are very good at playing the sly cool agents. And getting all four of them together in one scene is great for entertainment. I really liked this movies dialogue, I think the characters were very well written and the dialogue between the characters was funny and sometimes endearing, yes there were moments where the script was a little cheesy or typical of this type of film, but it was still overall entertaining. The action sequences were well orchestrated and filmed, pretty run of the mill action scenes. This movie isn't excellent or really great, not the type to win any major awards, but it is fairly entertaining. 7/10 for keeping up with the joneses."
" A hilarious action comedy...

And also a big thumbs up to writer Michael LeSieur.This movie has some wonderful talents to the cast list, actors and actresses whom are able to combine comedy and action together. Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher really brought the comedy out in the movie, while Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot brought out most of the action but also supplied with comedy. Aside from these lead performers, there were also a great performance and appearance by Patton Oswalt.I had a good amount of fun and was brought to laughs often throughout the course of this movie. The comedy is clever and works out quite well as it is executed on the screen.If you enjoy comedies then ""Keeping Up with the Joneses"" is definitely a good pick given the storyline, the comedy and the entertainment that it provides."

No couple is as perfect as the Joneses and and no couple is as cringy as the other couple. The friendship that they develop is unlikely, a couple can not become a spy overnight. Villain: Weak and implausible. The dealer is an old employee of the company that Jeff knew? Many questions. How did he become the the head of the Scorpion if he was so unimportant? Is it that easy to become the lead of such a dangerous group? Storytelling: Basically you know the movie from the trailer. No surprises and very predictable. The bug enigma should be who the Joneses are and we know from the beginning they are spies, well from the trailer. Nothing interesting there. Character development: The only character that shows a bit of further grow is Tim's when he admits that he does not like his job but nothing more to it. And what's the point of admitting it if you will continue doing the same job regardless? Acting/Casting: No chemistry between the Joneses. I know Gal was supposed to portray this strong cold woman and she does indeed but leaves you wondering what the hack is Tim doing with her then? Mr and Mrs Smith anyone? That is the chemistry you would be looking for. Again with the Gaffneys, no chemistry. They come across as children. I know Zach Galifianakis was supposed to make the movie funny but it just made it cring.Overall, It is entertaining and occasionally makes you laugh but it has absolutely no quality to it."

While the story may not be anything new, and certainly isn't a film with a lot of depth, the performances, direction, script, and the editing, all but made up for it. Simply put, the movie has a lot of absurd happenings told with such straight faces, that it makes it so hilarious to watch. I watched this on the plane, and I am sure, I must have disturbed some people. I might have even forgotten I was on the plane - I was laughing so hard (but silently). Galifianakis and Fisher have great chemistry together. Their ridiculous reactions, and how their characters are so bad at being discrete, is such fun to watch. On the other hand, Hamm and Gadot are a little like trolls. They act badass well enough, but their characters are overly serious most of the time. It's just too much to handle mixed together (in a good way).What makes the film great is the subtle, and not so subtle jokes that come one after another. And what makes it perfect, is the delivery of them. Michael LeSieur did an amazing job with the screenplay. The cast envisioned the characters flawlessly. This is what comedy is. As well, the film is very stylishly made, and has great scenes. The cinematography, sound effects and visual effects complement each other well. Plus, there is quite a bit of great action scenes that are nicely done too. Overall, I just genuinely loved this film.

'Mastermind' was a fun crime film based on the true event, but this one was purely fictional action-comedy. Once again the casting looked so good. Particularly Gal Gadot, her involving in it after becoming Wonder Woman is a hype. So anyone to anticipating some great action sequences is normal, but it was average on that section.First of all, it is nothing to do with the 2009 film 'The Jonese'. The characters seem quite resembling, like between and about the neighbors, but totally different plot. When a new couple move into a vacant house, the one in the neighborhood suspect there's something going with them. After all the efforts, when they come to know the couple's true identity, they're already involved in their undertaking and now cooperating is the only way out. So how it ends with their entanglement takes the film to its final stage.Comedy scenes were good. Not that much clichéd, so one can have a decent fun watching it, especially with a low expectation. Both the lead women were hot, despite not much cleavage in the film. There are some unexpected parts too, but as a comedy, it was much better. And as an action & spy film, it doesn't do much to impress. Overall, a passable film, particularly comedy wise. So if you prefer it, then it should be on that merit.6/10"

Basically, following Jeff (Zach Galifianakis) and his wife Karen (Isla Fisher) who is a predictable couple, living in a nice quiet suburban house. They get new neighbors Tim (Jon Hamm) and Natalie (Gal Gadot), who are that perfect couple that's done a lot of traveling and they seem perfect in everyway. Except for one cache, they are spies, who are trying to investigate in a leak with government information that is in Jeff's work company. Next thing you know, there is a team of bad guys chasing Jeff as Tim and Natalie are trying to protect them. All while, trying to recover the stolen files. The film does have a few laughs with stupid humor. It is one of those movies were you will only laugh once and view and forget about it. There was no real sense of a plot besides a redundant idea that's been used in other comedy movies. About a secret file involving weapons and they need the clumsy characters to try to claim it back. It is amusing to see the talented cast in the movie. The script and direction is so boring and predictable. This comedy film will be forgotten within a month.

" total waste of talent
",0.0,-0.2484,2017-02-17 00:00:00,4,"It's Wonder Woman with three great actors and a boring script. This film is yet another example of why writing is more important than casting. If you like to drool over Gal, the lingerie sequence was a treat. She is extra sexy in that, but to me it wasn't enough to justify wasting time watching this rather dull film.All four actors have comedic timing. Yes, even Gal Gadot, who, I myself criticized for poor acting. Here she is cast as the tough, yet sexy agent/spy and does it well. Her part is formed well around what she can do- not to much, not to less and shows she does have timing, problem is the jokes are bad half the time and it leans to much on Isla Fisher and Zach Galifianakis. The geek-meets popular, good, looking people scenario is becoming painfully cliché. And doesn't work all too well seeing as Isla Fisher is very attractive. It also is more distracting than an element to move the plot along.And I have no idea what's going on with Jon Hamm. He is totally wasted in this. It's bad action sequences and bad comedy mixed into a romance of sorts. It has it's moments thanks to the cast and especially Zach and Isla, but overall it's a poor mans Mr. and Mrs. Smith.Not even worth a dollar rental."
" Gal Gadot star power shines bright!
",0.4926,0.99,2017-02-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie gets ten stars from me because of two words. Gal Gadot!! Every film I see her in I love her acting and her more and more!! In her last film the dramatic thriller ""Criminal"" she demonstrated a vulnerable yet strong willed woman. Here in ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" she shows her ability to cross over and do comedy also. While watching her in this film I could not help but think of the strong connection to another spy thriller with some comedy. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Gadot as Natalie Jones and spy partner Jon Hamm as Tim Jones in KUWTJ (Keeping up with the Joneses) their spy team attire is similar to the Pitt & Jolie spy team as are their spy team mannerisms. Gadot has the similar physical features of Jolie, add a few inches in height for Gadot. Gadot is one of the hottest new actresses, she will appear in her own upcoming film starring as action heroine ""Wonder Woman."" A more appropriate title for Gal Gadot could not be made. Gadot has an edge on Jolie for she can do comedy far better than Jolie. Also in KUWTJ and her other films Gadot has an inner warmth that she projects on the screen, something Jolie does not possess. I give all ten stars to Gal Gadot for her wonder woman performance and charisma. She is a wonder to behold!! Watch her in this film to see a future super star in the making!!"

Some lines don't make sense; however, remember, this is just a comedy!I think we should re-evaluate the way we review and rate movies, since you cannot rate a comedy the same way you rate a drama. In a drama you are looking for a great script / screenplay, and amazing actors like Eddie Redmayne, Denzel Washington, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Lupita Nyong, or Natalie Portman; for real! in a comedy all you want is to laugh a lot! that's the purpose of a comedy! it's not about a great script!

",0.4939,0.9955,2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Thankfully - we have the utter disaster of a movie that was ""Mr & Mrs Smith"" as a baseline for this movie - although I personally found it more in line with ""The Whole Nine Yards"". Now it's probably no secret that too many people who do reviews take themselves WAY too seriously and seem to think that everyone who reads their review will consider them to have been the center of their universe for a few minutes (newsflash - watch the yelp episode of southpark - that's you - exactly you) - but I kind of expected people to cut this movie the slack it much desperately needs. Reviewers seem to be utterly incensed that this is not some uber slick Jason Bourne effort; but those same reviewers ranked both ""Skyfall"" (the truly first ever raping of the James Bond Franchise) and ""Inception"" (one of the worst movies ever made) rather highly - and really only showing there is no accounting for taste.This is a lighthearted, funny af movie with an EXCEPTIONALLY solid cast, direction and production. It's let down by some glaringly poor continuity and editing - but that's the only reason I am not giving it a solid 10. Now let me explain something - I cannot STAND Zack Gandalfushallnotpassius or whatever his name is - I still want a full refund for the 1h 30m of my life spent watching him attempt to act in ""the Hangover"" - but he totally owns this movie. Gal Gadot and Jon Hamm are literally two of the best casting decisions made in a movie in a long time. It does not have to be Oscar worthy to be good casting. They are not only polished - but they are believable. They could do with being a bit more ""bad-ass"" but it's hard to say more about that without giving away spoilers.Isla Fisher was new to me - but I loved her. She's cute and sassy, but carries her character very very well indeed. Second only to Zack - her performance was superb.This is not a sleek, intellectual thriller - if that's what you want - watch the Odessa Files, or Bourne - or Bond (but obviously before Barbara Broccoli turned it into an utterly crap franchise) - it's not an action packed explosions/car chase filled movie - it's dry humor delivered with impeccable style. Reviewers need to learn how to look at a movie for what it is and review it that way - rather than review it for what they thought it would be like.Pros: it's slick and moves at a great pace. It has a predictable plot that leaves you with no illusions of grandeur - there is nothing to figure out - this movie does it all for you. Beautifully I might add. Great acting - tons of laughs if you don't expect Katt Williams levels of comedic genius. Gal Gadot in lingerie. Isla Figher In lingerie.Cons: it's slightly bereft of any really cool action scenes. Having the spies be utterly impeccable would have been a really good idea - but they are kinda just smartish - run of the mill types. Some of the plot line makes very little sense - but this is not a proposition for Wittgenstein - so really who cares if this spy-comedy is a little plot thin? Continuity/editing is awful in one very particular spot.Totally unnecessary - but utterly welcome extra Pro: This movie has Gal Gadot in it. In lingerie. Let me restate that: *clears throat* Gal fricking Gadot - in fricking lingerie!! That's an automatic 4 or 5 stars. It also has Isla Fisher in Lingerie - but seriously people Gal Gadot In lingerie!I highly recommend this movie. It's a ""lay on the couch with your significant other eating popcorn and drinking red wine"" type of movie. And that's just fine by me :)"

The highlight of the film is certainly the connection and chemistry between the four main cast members, all of the individual relationships between Zach Galifanakis, Isla Fisher, Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot is what makes this movie watchable. They all have great comedic timing with one another, it was clear they had trust in each other.I did feel the plot did not go as far as a viewer would expect a film about spies to go. The final act is very underwhelming, as we are expecting this big blow out, but it actually ends up being very straight forward and predictable, nothing shocking or truly exciting really occurs. As well as that, it simply is not as funny as it should have been. I had higher hopes with a cast like this, I was expecting a laugh a minute sort of movie, but there are several scenes without a single good joke in there. The writing came across as somewhat lazy, as if they gave up halfway through. It does show that a film that is verging on mediocrity can be saved simply by the sincere chemistry between its lead cast. While it is certainly flawed, Keeping up with the Joneses is still mindless fun, worth the watch if you are looking for a good comedy, but do not go out of your way to see it.

There really isn't anything all that new and the movie is a little cookie cutter, but the acting and jokes make it seem fresh and exciting. The chemistry between all four of the actors is almost perfect and really helps the movie a ton. This movie won't win any awards or become a classic, but it is hilarious and I laughed throughout the entire thing. That is what a good comedy should do. I would compare this to Central Intelligence.

" Good fun - totally saved by Isla Fisher
",0.8516,0.9883,2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"A nice little remake of Killers with Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher - only lacking some of the charm, but in the same way that Katherine Heigl saved Killers with her wit and charm, Isla Fisher does the same for Keeping Up with the Joneses. Her physical approach to humour, throwing herself on the floor, crawling rapidly and fervently to the window, all the covert antics in the build up made the movie entertaining and watchable. John Hamm also acquitted himself professionally with a sterling performance. That is not meant to take away from Zach Galifianakis who plays the lead role of inept and embarrassing suburban HR dude living out his domestic existence in their cul-de-sac of life. Although type cast in those roles, his usual characters require less subtlety than this role demanded. But back again to Isla Fisher whose warm and charm brightened and brought to life all her scenes. Badly let down by Gal Gadot who is incapable of losing her ugly (sorry) Israeli accent humorlessly delivering lines like ""Welcome to the exciting and sexy world of international espionage"" with such a lack of conviction you wonder how she was cast in the first place. I know she's tall and I know she's a looker and I know the Hollywood Jewish clan love to favour their own, but honestly the woman has no talent at all. Her lack of warmth, lack of humour, lack of conviction must have been an immense frustration for the Director. Hollywood needs to be able to admit its mistakes, before she ruins the Wonder Woman franchise. I agree, she can do physical stuff, she can hold a gun convincingly (thanks to her military experience) but that's the only thing she does well. So if you are prepared to wince through her awful lines and go with the flow of the rest of the movie you'll be able to enjoy it, just. There are hundreds of actresses that could have done a better job that Gadot - I just don't see the need for appalling casting decisions like that. Every other cameo role was well played, why ruin the movie for some political end? I just don't get it."

",0.0,0.3105,2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I know the phrase (title) is old, and it did work in 1989 for the third Indy adventure, but at least the title didn't end with those horrid, despicable, boring, ugly, talentless, money-grabbing Kardashians. That alone should convince you to see this. When you watch a movie that's been done dozens of times before and doesn't actually bring much to the table in shocking twists but you still have a good time and laugh out loud...it's worth keeping up with the Joneses.True, it's not groundbreaking and I only laughed in certain parts, but overall, it's a nice throwback to the countless ideas like this. There was heart at minute times and charisma amongst the cast. But mainly, I would be lying if I didn't fully LOL at several scenes.Here is where I enter in my normal, hopefully spoiler-free synopsis. But, this movie's plot is probably one of the oldest out there: A new ""perfect"" couple moves in to the most beautiful neighborhoods I've seen in a while, or cul-de-sacs, anyways. It appears everyone is into everyone else's business and two residents puts together that the Joneses aren't what they seem.It's not perfect, certainly not innovative and absolutely could've been cut down 15 or so minutes to the 90-minute mark it needed to be at, but I did have a fun time. As the movie progressed, I did laugh harder and that, to me, is a recommendation.***Final thoughts: In no world have I lived is it was okay for H.R. representatives allowed to socialize with their firm's employees. I get this is part of the world these Cul-de-sac neighbors live in and work together, but it would be sooo condemned by the company for our lead (H.R. employee) to mingle with other employees. Never would happen. Yeah, I know this is a silly, sometimes-action spy comedy, but that really stood out when I was watching this."
" Nails on a chalkboard!
",0.0,-0.3353,2017-01-08 00:00:00,4,"I won't repeat the plot, or lack thereof. Galifianakis seems to be going for Hollywood emaciated to the point his head now looks too big for his body. This movie is approaching the Jerry Lewis school of over-the-top stupid slapstick that only the French could love. I really really wanted someone - anyone - to shoot Galifianakis, his character was so unrealistically clueless. He plays a Human Resources manager who violates every rule of HR confidentiality and had to do a double-take in nearly every scene... so those of us texting and looking up occasionally would know it was supposed to be funny. Aarrgghhh. Nothing new in the plot, recycled dialog, predictable ending. Just keep texting. I gave it a 4 for the rare skit that worked, and the fact that it was smart enough to never go over 15 seconds without action."

",0.0,-0.2359,2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Keeping Up With the JonesesThe worst thing about living next-door to a spy is everything they lend you releases knockout gas.Mind you, noxious fumes aren't needed to convince the wary couple in this action-comedy.From the day the Joneses (Jon Hamm, Gal Gadot) moved next-door, the Gaffneys (Zach Galifianakis, Isla Fisher) have been suspicious of their good looks and enviable careers. It's not until they discover a listening device in their home that they suspect the couple of being secret agents.With their cover now blown, the Joneses agree to partner with the bumbling Gaffneys to accomplish their mission: delivering missile defensive Intel to an arms dealer (Patton Oswalt).With a weak premise and an unrecognizably svelte Galifianakis, this suburban spy-spoof struggles to find laughs in its capable cast. The action portion is equally tepid.Another telltale sign your neighbour is a spy: all the books they borrow you have been redacted. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
" An amusing film with subtle humor that could have been pushed further
",0.5719,0.9746,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"""Keeping Up with the Joneses"" is an enjoyable, amusing comedy with good performances and production values that are more than adequate. Most of the laughs may not be huge memorable ROFL moments and much of the material is familiar to audiences who have seen ""Mr. and Mrs. Jones,"" ""The Spy Next Door"" and similar comedies. The comedy may not have quite the significance of ""Love, Actually."" But the film offers a steady stream of amusing gags and jibes at the mid-American suburban lifestyle. The high-speed car chase through an abandoned factory is done competently, but can't hold a candle to the stunt work in a Jackie Chan movie. A climatic shoot-out is better than typical television fare, but fairly tame compared to the shootout in ""Django Unchained,"" ""Mr. and Mrs. Jones"" or ""Mr. Nice Guy."" Compared with Galifianakis's earlier appearances in the ""Hangover"" movies, the humor is low-key and fans may be dismayed that the filmmakers failed to push the envelope further. As is the usual custom, the filmmakers rely too heavily on distracting jiggly-cam shots with very little consideration as to whether camera movement arguably contributes or detracts. One can easily criticize the film for what it is not and for what it fails to do; however, in its own right, it is an amusing, entertaining and pleasant diversion. It deserves better reviews. Perhaps much of the humor is too subtle for mass appeal."
" Dismal beyond description
",-0.6124,0.8793,2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"I struggle to find the adjectives to sufficiently express how truly bad this movie was - in my opinion, of course. I understand that everyone has varied tastes, but cannot actually envisage anyone enjoying this movie if they have sufficient remaining brain function to maintain their body's natural breathing reflex.Okay, a thin basic plot device and vacuous story-line can be overcome to some extent by clever writing, directing and acting. Unfortunately, in this case there was no cleverness or quality to save the movie, which I found to be a cheap, superficial, unfunny disaster that made me cringe with every single scene. I usually enjoy the occasional bad movie, recognising that the 'badness' can sometimes offer a certain charm of its own. This cinematic dross does not.Still struggling to find the right adjectives..... Nope, I don't think they've been coined yet."
" Before you try to KEEP up with the JONESES, be sure they're not trying to KEEP up with you.
",0.3182,0.9954,2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"I was immediately drawn to Keeping Up with the Joneses once I saw who it starred. With names like Zach Galifianakis, Isla Fisher, Gal Gadot, and Jon Hamm, this film boasts a talented cast list. With the exception of Hamm, all of the above actors have been some of my favourite films. I'm a huge fan of Jon Hamm because of SNL and Mad Men. And he was very good in this one as well.Keeping Up with the Joneses offers some pretty good laughs but doesn't seem to fully utilize the talent its cast possesses. However, that's not to say they don't do well. All four of them have great chemistry with each other. Either in pairs or all of them together, each scene made me at least smile with enjoyment, if not laugh a little. But that is all the reaction they earned. I think that was my biggest disappointment in this movie is there aren't many stand-out or laugh-out-loud moments. It was enjoyable but mostly forgettable. Despite being veterans of comedies, both Galifianakis and Fisher are fairly forgettable when compared to their roles in other films, such as The Hangover or The Wedding Crashers respectively. Hamm and Gadot seem to have fun as the more serious counterparts to Galifianakis and Fisher. They played to their strengths better than the other members of the cast, turning out more of the memorable moments than the others. But overall Fisher and Hamm was terrific! I'd say don't worry about it too much unless you are a big fan of anyone in the cast. The film is not unwatchable, it just didn't live up to the potential it could have had with the cast. But it's not their fault. It's the crappy screenplay and bad directing that killed the one that could've been something big. If I ever come across it on TV i would stop and watch it but I'm in no hurry to add it to my film collection.Keeping Up with the Joneses was OK. I know I might have painted the picture that I didn't enjoy the film a whole lot but I did. It just left me underwhelmed where I was expecting more from such a talented cast. Keeping Up with the Joneses plays it safe. It was a good comedy that walks this weird middle ground where it is not too exciting while never becoming drab either. It's actually pretty impressive how ordinary it is."
" A fun suburanite/spies mashup
",0.5106,0.9761,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"This film was a lot of fun! A suburban couple dedicated to their kids, careers and cul-de-sac neighborhood have their orderly lives upended by new neighbors who seem a bit larger than life and turn out to be just that. The film has fun with the characters (whose personalities drive a lot of the humor), their reactions to their changing situations, with everyone trying to keep their priorities straight. The conventions of spy movies are entertainingly employed and spoofed. Overall, a good mix of humor and action, and also has a sense of respect for all the characters.Being in a similar stage of life and circumstances to the main characters (minus the car chases, explosions and such) likely added to the enjoyment."
" Excellent - Loads of Laugh-Out-Loud Moments
",0.5719,0.9957,2017-01-02 00:00:00,10,"""Keeping Up With The Joneses"" is a wonderful classic absurdist comedy with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to go around.The lead actors have great chemistry, and the script is smart and sassy. If you enjoy this type of comedy, where one character keeps his foot permanently inserted in his mouth, you'll love the movie.I'm a pushover for good movies, but I get absolutely delighted when I get to laugh out loud.I can easily recommend this delightful comedy, and I plan to watch it again and soon, too.When I use IMDb reviews to help me pick out movies to watch, I'm only interested in reading reviews from those who loved the movie. I seriously want to know why they loved it. I couldn't care less about negative reviews. I set the filters for review searches to show me only the reviews where people loved what they saw. Doing it this way, I end up liking better than 95% of the movies I pick. My only objection to IMDb review rules is the 10 line minimum. A few sentences is all I need. Anything more is a waste of my time."
