" Um
",0.0,0.0,2021-03-08 00:00:00,1,What was the point of this movie. I got nothing out it.
" Good directorial debut.
",0.4404,0.8606,2021-03-03 00:00:00,7,"Not quite Goosekino but, a pretty good directorial debut."
" Great acting, terrible storyline
",0.25,0.914,2020-12-25 00:00:00,2,"I don't understand how such great actors signed on to this terrible production. I am guessing they participated because it was Ryan Gosling making the request. I'm guessing they wouldn't do a 2nd project with him. What a waste of their amazing talent with this weird and nonsensical presentation. The story itself isn't bad, and I could see Stephen King making a screenplay worthy of Saoirse Ronan and Christina Hendricks. And as hateful a character as he was, probably the best acting of the movie was who played ""Bully"", Matt Smith."
" Weak story
",-0.4404,0.704,2020-11-23 00:00:00,5,"Question mark at the end of the movie. I am not quite clear what I have seen or what the movie is aiming at. The entire plot is packed into impressive pictures and accompanied by a harmonious soundtrack. But that was it. All in all a flat plot, with which I can only do little. I was not drawn into the story and I was not able to establish a connection to the characters.The basic idea was good and as a directing debut it is good as well. But all in all a weak story is faded over with fancy and partly shocking pictures & soundtrack."
" The edge of tension, the edge of violence
",-0.7506,0.8268,2020-10-14 00:00:00,10,"Lost river is a perfect example of how to grind an audience with immediate and sustained tension. Honestly, watching this movie was such an anxious experience that at many points I could hardly bare to continue. The other miracle is how it espouses violence and gore, yet deftly sets itself back from it. In other words, one keeps expecting to see terrible acts of extreme sadism at several moments, as you sit there shivering with nervous anticipation, yet somehow things resolve again and again, moving back from the brink, yet at the same time the tension never ceases for a moment, in fact, it just keeps building. This is one of the most original set ups I've seen in a movie. I say setups rather than story, because most of the elements here most of us would have encountered before. Yet, somehow, brilliantly, not in the way Lost River presents itself. Fantastic framing, colour and sound as well. Lost River was definitely an experience I won't be forgetting for some time."
" An astounding and audacious film
",0.5719,0.8597,2020-10-03 00:00:00,9,"I can certainly understand why there are so many mixed reviews and a substantial amount of dissent when it comes to this film. I myself thought it was a near masterpiece. I thought the soundtrack itself was spectacular. I'm so sick and tired of these boring conventional classical soundtracks that amount to absolutely nothing. Total empty suit, elevator music. This soundtrack was spectacular and it really served to draw you into the story. The acting was sublime. Ben Mendelson was great as were most of the performances. Bally, Mouth, Mom, the kid, were great characters.The film was very, very well done, it is not for everyone. I get that, it was very surrealist, and added up to a dystopian nightmare, which was which is right up my alley.Very dark and very moody and atmospheric. One of the things that really stood out about the film was the cinematography and the second thing was the editing which was absolutely gorgeous and pitch perfect. The direction was excellent and for the life of me I don't understand why Gosling is not doing more directing. He must have been discouraged by the poor reviews.I recommend this film, but only the people who really understand and appreciate dark surrealist work.Most of America would be completely lost watching this movie. Far too abstract and symbolic for them."
" Layers
",0.0,0.9108,2020-08-19 00:00:00,9,"Just because a movie is complex or has more than just its surface, does not mean you have to like it. Or that there is an issue with you not being into it. There's different movies for different tastes. And even those who are into movies that mess them up a bit or make them think, might not be the biggest fans of this. It's all ok, but if you are willing to dive into this (no pun intended), there is quite the mesmerizing movie for you to see.An amazing cast, which was to expect, when Ryan Gosling is calling you to act in his movie. Who wouldn't respond to that? A lot did and the result is amazing to say the least! But apart from the wonderful pictures (framing, photography), it is the intricately woven story that might be able to get to you. Many layers to break through and a lot of crazy things to sort out. I don't think I've encrypted all of it, but I do think I got the overall message and most points he tried to get across. Again, you have to be open to this kind of movie ... otherwise it'll be a waste of time"
" No, It's not!!
",-0.4184,0.3839,2020-08-03 00:00:00,4,"What a pile, this wannabe flick is so pretentious, instead of running parallel to Lynch & Cronenberg, it tries to emulate. I can just see Gosling in front of the producers saying ""look what I can Do"". Really don't waste your time on this."
" Half of it is really good
",0.4927,0.9565,2020-07-31 00:00:00,5,"Everything with Christina Hendricks and Ben Mendelsohn at the gore club is fantastic.Unfortunately, everything with Iain De Caestecker and Saoirse Ronan, with the exception of one excellent scene in a convenience store, is pretty boring.I still have a lot of respect for this movie though, and I'm definitely glad I watched it. It definitely makes we want to see what Ryan Gosling will direct next."
" An Artsy Fartsy movie that I like? Never thought it would happen!
",0.4199,0.8908,2020-06-13 00:00:00,8,"It's slow, it's artsy, it's beautiful.
I like it because most artsy movies you're left wondering, ""What was any of that supposed to mean?""
This movie is beautiful and it makes sense.
Great Soundtrack by Johnny Jewel (look up Chromatics and Italians Do It Better)Ryan Gosling made an Album called 'Dead Man's Bones.' On that album there is a song called 'Buried in Water.' I think this movie is directly related to the song. Watch and listen to discover the secrets of the Lost River!"
" Criminally Underrated Misunderstood
",-0.34,0.9411,2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,"I have no problems with an artist wearing their influences on their sleeves. Gosling created a surreal environment full of beautiful bold colors. Masterfully juxtaposing hues with a haunting, dreamy soundtrack I found myself in a hyper normal type of reality. Although the story seemed incomplete at times, I really felt that made it more mysterious and compelling. I completely understand this movie had its flaws but just for the incredibly bold decision and confidence to make a true piece of art/cinema, I will rate Lost River a bit higher than where it should be. You get my point and there are thousands of people out there that developed a unique relationship with this world and I hope by 2025 or 2030 it's revisited as a classic."
" Dark, mysterious, fantasy.
",0.0,0.807,2020-04-12 00:00:00,9,"This really captured my imagination, a creative, slick production.
The characters were convincing, the locations stark and disturbing.
I particularly loved the night club. Oh yes, that was weird.
The atmosphere throughout was dangerous and deliciously surreal."
" Lost River contains a masterpiece that cries out to be made
",0.0258,0.9871,2020-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Ryan Gosling has a refined taste in art for someone whom I initially knew from Hollywood rom-coms and formulated love stories. He clearly adores the neon lights and ""quasi-80's"" atmosphere of the films he has starred in, such as Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive and most recently Blade Runner 2049, hence it makes sense that the first film he ever directed would possess many similar traits.Lost River (2014) has the color schemes and hauntingly beautiful Johnny Jewel music of Refn's work. Its vintage theaters, occasional vintage clothes, surreal atmosphere, the unspeakably violent character of Bully, and its sound design often remind one of David Lynch (who, as some of you know, has also worked with the bands of Jewel, namely when he revived Twin Peaks in 2017). Finally, the nature shots and the editing often have a touch of Terrence Malick, with whom Gosling collaborated on Song To Song. Again, what an eye for art and unique filmmaking for a designated rom-com hunk.The story takes us to a post-apocalyptic and mostly abandoned Detroit, where Billy (Christina Hendricks) tries to get by and care for her two sons, Bones (Iain De Caestecker) and Franky. She finds work at some sort of surreal sex-and-gore club, managed by an eccentric Ben Mendelsohn and featuring Eva Mendes as Cat, one of the performers.A flooded city is said to lie nearby, with street lights sticking out of the river, and houses in the area inexplicably catch fire during the nights - one character blames a ""spell"". The adjacent ruins are terrorized by Bully, played by an utterly Matt Smith. Oh hey, that almost rhymes!The film also stars Saoirse Ronan, even more unimaginably dreamy when submerged in Gosling's magical world, and the colors and music that exist therein. Did I mention that she, like some of her fellow cast members, has a song on the soundtrack, music courtesy of Jewel (duh)?As much I praise Gosling and his unusual choices, this is still an evident debut film - albeit a fairly impressive one at that. There are some shots that don't quite work, it isn't too engaging or skillful on a story level, and the aforementioned allusions to Lynch, Malick and Refn can be a little too blatant. This isn't a large damage, however, and I hope Gosling is inspired to continue in spite of the boos that were dealt during the Cannes film festival. On some screenings there were cheers, though, so it's safe to say the film left an impression either way.As for Johnny Jewel, this film has no doubt, along with Drive and Twin Peaks: The Return, cemented him and his multiple synth-heavy bands (in my eyes) as one of the most uniquely beautiful and hauntingly emotional examples of modern-day music. Equally as iconic as Saoirse's song is ""Yes"", one of many Chromatics songs that have been remixed by another of Jewel's associated acts, Symmetry. I also enjoyed a Glass Candy track that plays when Mendelsohn traps Hendricks inside a skin-tight cage of sorts and begins dancing seductively in front of her.I loved so many things about this movie but I cannot rightly sweep its problems under the rug. Lost River contains a masterpiece that cries out to be made. I'm sure of it, and equally sure that we might get to see it once Gosling develops his own style. Paying homage to the artists that inspired you is a good start, though. I hope it is not the end."
" Dystopian fairytale featuring 21st century horrors
",-0.5719,-0.5507,2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Desperate to retain the house she grew up in and her sons now call home Billy (Christina Hendricks) agrees to a dubious job proposed by her dirty dealing bank manager, and it's darker than you could ever imagine.Her eldest son, Bones, wants to free his mother of her money troubles and his copper-stripping trips lead him on an adventure to discover the history of Lost River and the curse said to be behind its demise.Ryan Gosling's first foray into directing (he also wrote the film) is set in a near-desolate Detroit town with most of its residents forced into poverty or moving home. Not too far from the truth, except in Gosling's fantastical world, the town is now run by a modern-day Mad Max, played by our own scene-stealing (possibly film-carrying) Matt Smith, who you may know better as The Doctor.Lost River occupies a weighty middle ground between raw documentation of the human struggle and Hollywood-friendly theatrics, with glamour-grunge imagery and a haunting soundtrack. The fact heart throb of the decade, Gosling, is responsible for the project is nothing more than a distraction, but a welcome one if it goads a wider audience to see a film likely to have only small-scale success on the indie circuit.Succumb to the dystopian fairy-tale world and experience the 21st century horrors some sadly know as their reality."
" Practically Unwatchable
",0.0,0.5369,2019-08-03 00:00:00,1,Weird collection of scenes that were so bizarre that I feel you need to be high on something for this to be interesting. I was hoping for a dystopian story with some of my favorite actors; instead I'm not really sure what this was. You can appreciate the bold artistic choices but don't expect anything resembling a coherent film.
" Beneath the lake lies the cure

Pop flop out the gate, review bashed, blonde hating fans lined my sight upon an overpriced rental. Watched twice in 48 hours i was hooked on I don't know what kinda of dark art mysteria.
I bought it aswell, so I'll say no more about its integrity and depth.

" Oh, it's an allegory
",0.0,0.9306,2019-04-12 00:00:00,2,"Or, as the description states, ""A dark fairy tale."" This is one of those ""deeply personal"" movies that clearly means something to the director, but not anybody else. It's one of those movies that doesn't rely on dialogue, just a lot of meaningful shots of buildings, cars, people (having some kind of emotion -- it's like watching narcoleptics). Dialogue would only get in the way by just driving the plot and providing narrative. But that would be so prosaic. The final line of the IMDB description sums it up best: ""... an unexpected journey that will test his limits and the limits of those he loves."" But, it's the viewer who will be most tested."
" Bleak, foreboding, nightmarish surrealism.
",0.0,-0.7137,2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,"When I started watching this film, I was reminded of parts of Flint or Pontiac or Detroit (where I'd lived for a handful of years from mid/late-90's to early 2K's). Then I looked up the locations and was not surprised at all to find out I was right. This made me feel even more connected to it. The dismal feel of these parts of the city that are about as gone as you can get is so sad and hopeless.
All the characters were odd in very individualistic ways and yet not one of them felt forced or caricaturish. I believed their predicaments and their actions/reactions. All of them are very much victims of their environment.It seems as if Ryan Gosling has a very good feel for drawing the audience in and mesmerizing us. The sparseness of dialogue seems very apropos. Without giving in to the normal Hollywood practice of showing the detail of how women are debased, the film merely alludes. I applaud that detail.I really liked this film. Honestly, I don't even remember it coming out in theaters. I'm so glad I happened upon it on HBONow."
" Made me want to fight Ryan Gosling
",-0.3182,0.2263,2019-03-02 00:00:00,2,He finished this and then thought it was worth selling for $15 a ticket?
" Are you kidding?
",0.1027,-0.752,2019-01-23 00:00:00,2,The actors were entertaining. The scenery was interestingly eyecatching ... BUT whoever wrote this? Is really messed up!! Sadly ...
" Wish I was smarter so I could figure this out
",0.6908,0.986,2019-01-19 00:00:00,3,"I'm sorry but I watch movies so I don't be have to think. I'm sure this is supposed to be some kind of ""high art"" where we are supposed to extrapolate all kinds of themes and underlying messages but I'm not part of the Hollywood elite nor am I trying to prove something to someone so I just didn't get it.If the story had just been about a mother trying to take care of her two sons and had the side story of Saoirse Ronan and her grandmother that might've been an OK story BUT throwing in the bully with the disturbing images of people's faces that he mutilated and the rat scene and then of course the disturbing images at the nightclub is just trying to prove too much and it just seemed zany.I'm all for people being able to express themselves but this seems like more of a project that Ryan could've shown exclusively to his friends and family without having to subject audiences to it. Plus it lost a lot of money so I don't see how it could've been anything beneficial for him.The actual real people from the area acting in this did a better job than some of the other actors in the movie. I do think that Christina Hendricks is absolutely stunning and a good actress so anytime she's on screen you're just struck by how beautiful she is. I don't really particularly care for Saoirse Ronan-I can't figure out why. She is a good actress but something about her looks puts me off however she was good in this. Her hair looks better darker. That kid ""Bones"" did a good job. The toddler was kind of annoying. Eva Mendes was wasted. Ben Mendelssohn was just a little too over-the-top and wacky for me. Matt Smith was awkward and gave a cringe-worthy performance.I don't think I'd recommend this but then again what do I know?"
" Pretentious,and pointless
",0.0,-0.9564,2019-01-08 00:00:00,3,"If you took a David Lynch film and removed everything about a David Lynch film that is cool, and then doubled up on a bunch of ham handed pretentious (just being strange for the sake of being strange, and still manages to be SO BORING) That is Lost River. I have never said this before, but it might be the worst movie I have ever seen. Gosling is an OK actor I am sure (I have never watched any of his films) But this was one of the most terribly directed/executed films I have ever seen Despite having a very decent budget and some very talented actors!!! That's what makes it so maddening to 'try' to watch. ANYWAY, It's a good future director's lesson on how to make a dark,and violent movie SO BORING. ."
" Left confused & disappointed
",-0.6597,0.9244,2018-12-16 00:00:00,3,"Although the concept is right up my ally as far as film noir goes I still feel lost & left wondering where the rest of the movie was. I am no expert and do not claim to be I do feel as if even if this is your genre or film preference you may agree that it was an abrupt ending & there perhaps could have been more depth & maybe another unexpected hook or a faux foreshadowing so just when you think you know what is going to happens it takes an unexpected turn & plot twist becomes the main tie that pulls everything together & possibly a bit more background or longer part that sums up where characters all had a wrap up piece so that they could all have a place where they fit into the story line & how they affected the film. There was no suspense or shock value. I read mixed reviews it made me think I should just stop it before it started but I gave it a chance & I'm not all that impressed. Would now take my highly recommended rate down to a don't waste your time, unless you are in the business of making your own creation & need a few good ideas as far as noir or dark concepts go. I have to say for Gossling's first it was definitely on the right track. But it wasn't all brought back together concluding in my disappointment of a Saturday night. I feel like maybe I should have just had it on for background noise to fall asleep to. Artistic & creative just lack of story. It almost feels like I just got started awake from a really bad dream how it just ends but you never actually get to the ending & all I have are flashes of images & somehow my mind pieced together this story & it made sense when I was still in the in between awakening & dreaming but as soon as I had a chance to fully awaken it just made me shake my head convincing myself that it made no sense."
" Remarkable and haunting
",0.3612,0.9476,2018-11-14 00:00:00,10,"This is a real hidden gem and it's a crime it hasn't had better reviews. The overarching theme of poverty, being left behind and desperation was heart breaking, and I was rooting for all of the characters who, despite their best efforts, never seem to win. The cinematography was beautiful and Matt Smith made the right choice to not carry on with Dr who to go for roles like this. He and Ben Mandelson play insidious and ruthless bad guys with tremendous strength. The dancing scene was particularly chilling, my heart was in my mouth. Eva Mendes and christina Hendricks were stunning in this and the shame and loss Hendricks portrays was relatable as a mother who cannot support or provide for her children. Ronan played the love interest to de caestecker and she was understated and subtle, but still managed to exude power. This film portrayed the on going decay of middle america, and was powerful in its presentation. I hope the reviews haven't dissuaded ryan gosling from writing or directing because this was a very special film. I'd love to see more directing from him as I think he's an untapped talent in this regard."
" Interesting and Unexpected
",0.4019,0.981,2018-06-30 00:00:00,8,"This doesn't cover the plot or interpretation thereof, which are amply described by other reviews. It does represent the reaction upon first viewing by this non-expert, ordinary movie lover lacking an extraordinary vocabulary, view catalog, or memory. I was initially drawn to this film because Saoirse Ronan stars. Only later did I discover that Ryan Gosling wrote and directed, which sealed the deal. From the initial scenes, I anticipated a straightforward, marginally interesting, bland, depressing story. I was definitely wrong about the first three. The tone was in fact depressing, but hopeful. It slowly morphed into an ever more surprising, surreal plot reminiscent of David Lynch's efforts, especially ""Blue Velvet"", and those of Ingmar Bergman (I am not familiar with other directors mentioned in these reviews). Some moments were cringe evoking but were presented in a way that did not cause me to turn away. As usual with largely metaphoric films, I found it to be incomprehensible but fascinating. The acting was spot on. Cinematography and sound were fine and not distracting. It is a superb first effort behind the lens by Gosling. Who'd a thunk it would be anything like this? I look forward to his next work. I'm about to watch ""Lost River"" again, and probably more times afterward. Give it a try if you like unique, artsy-fartsy cult films."
" What this movie needs is a script.
",0.0,-0.335,2018-06-10 00:00:00,2,"Whatever you might think of Ryan Gosling as an actor he still has a lot to learn as both a writer and director, though admittedly his first film ""Lost River"" displays an outstanding visual sensibility at times but it's just too weird and pretentious to merit serious consideration. It's got a great cast but what it lacks is a script, (it's really just a series of silly ideas strung together). Consequently none of its highly talented performers can do anything with the frankly appalling material. Indeed this is the kind of unmitigated disaster most first-time directors would never recover from but at least Gosling has his acting career to fall back on and in the right part he is a very fine actor. I suppose you could call it 'a personal project' and I have been assured that it has a 'message', something about the dire economic state of America today though Gosling seems, at least on the surface, to be more interested in fire and water. Needless to say, the critics mostly hated it and the public stayed away."

" The sky is the limit
",0.0,0.9899,2018-04-03 00:00:00,8,"Let me start by saying this is not a boring film at all.Eva Mendes is great. Christina Hendricks and Saoirse Ronan are the beacons. Iain De Caestecker is a rising star. Ben Mendelsohn is smoothly developed. Matt Smith's character is spot on. Even the secondary characters help build up the story (these are particularly funny and creepy and full of color).A well executed painting from the first brushstrike to the last, this ""fairy tale-horror film"" is full of meaning and, in my personal opinion, the literary tools that work the inner gears are bright and speak highly of the odds of Gosling making more masterpieces as a director.Of course a large number of people will never take the time to understand this movie. Just as they'll never sit down and read a book.
Any good art piece, in my personal opinion, confronts many topics at the same time. Lost River does that, and, to my pleasure, it does without the need of words. By the way, the perfect amount of words is used throughout the movie.
Part of the magic of art lies in one finding those hidden meanings by your own, so I won't talk about any of them.Cinematography plays a huge part. Both in the beauty and in the storytelling aspects of this picture. Though a disciple of Malick and Refn, it is a personal film. I've fallen asleep to countless movies, thus I can guarantee you'll be getting to the edge of your seat the further it goes. Even the end credits are beautifully shot.""The sky is the limit"", I think, is an adequate way of defining Ryan Gosling's opera prima."
" Gosling delivers exactly what he intended
",0.0,0.9386,2018-01-12 00:00:00,8,"The best looking art film I've ever seen. Benoit Debie delivered absolutely exceptional visuals in this film. Fantastic Direction of the actors and memorable characters. There doesn't seem to anything pushing the story through, although this is clearly the intention (just as with any art film) so it is hard to judge Lost River for this.Ryan Gosling has directed a debut art film that in my eyes rivals the artists he clearly takes inspiration from. Although I can see other filmmakers in this, they come together to form something different, something Gosling.Absolutely worth watching if you're into art cinema. 0/10, should have been called ""Read My Lips""."
" slow magical fantasy
",0.0,-0.9324,2017-10-15 00:00:00,4,Billy (Christina Hendricks) is the single mother of Bones (Iain De Caestecker) and Franky struggling in Detroit. Bones is salvaging from the abandoned buildings while avoiding local thug Bully (Matt Smith). Their home is going under with the mortgage. The banker Dave (Ben Mendelsohn) offers her a mystery job. Rat (Saoirse Ronan) is their melancholy neighbor living with her grandma. A crew is tearing down the abandoned homes and Billy is targeted. Billy takes the job which turns out to be a blood-splattering performance theater led by Cat (Eva Mendes). Bones finds a road running under the river.This has a magical fantasy sensibility surrounding this all-too-real crumbling America. It doesn't quite work. This is an indie that needs no name actors. The magical fantasy would play a lot better that way but this feels fake rather than surreal. It wants to be wildly inventive but it has no wonder. It has the potential to be darker but it takes too long to get there. That darkness needs to start sooner. This is slowly paced. It needs more drive in the narrative in the first half. The second half just gets weirder and weirder until I almost laughed at the dancing. I don't need it to make sense. I do need it to make me feel something other than dismissiveness.
" Lost River (2014)
",-0.3182,0.9968,2017-05-28 00:00:00,7,"I've seen this film once before a few years back. While I wasn't overly impressed by it at the time, it just felt like one of those films that would grow on you when you revisit it and re-explore some of the themes that the film offers. On top of that it's directed by Ryan Gosling, who is probably my favorite actor going today.The film is best described as a surreal fantasy that follows a mother and her son, who are being threatened by eviction and other forces and need to try to survive. She takes a shady job to get by and her son is caught in the midst of a bully (aptly named Bully) who is out to make his and his girl's life hell. That was a terrible description, but it's just hard to encapsulate the film in a summary since its more experiential, than a by the books films.Gosling was definitely inspired by both Nicolas Winding Refn and David Lynch. I see more of Refn in it than anything, it's surreal, high on style and colors, dreamy music, gore, and characters who are memorable. I will say I don't think Gosling has truly mastered the scope of what he's trying to accomplish as the film is quite light on the effectiveness of having delivered a meaningful plot. However, I really enjoyed the film regardless. I love films that are dark with neon colors, atmospheric cinematography, and one that dips into the macabre. This film offers all that.I quite love the score of the film. I love the scene with Bones and Rat dancing in the abandoned building set to the dreamy and synth heavy music of The Chromatics (who is a Lynch favorite as we have seen on Twin Peaks this year). It's a beautiful scene, as a matter of fact there is a lot of beauty in the scenes of this film. I'm optimistic about Gosling's future in film, especially if he is emulating the best. This will be a love it or hate it type of movie and I'm on the positive side.7/10"

Sadly, Ryan Gosling seems to have gotten a bit too ambitious and started combining too many elements that the plot gets taken away. There are so many strange choices that Gosling makes as a director. I don't mind weird movies, if they make sense. This truly does not and I am sad to say that it did not hold my attention at all. A lot of potential here wasted."

I'd like to see him put more of what he brings to the table as an actor (himself) in his writing. I wasn't compelled to watch the movie past the first ten minutes because I couldn't relate to the characters. The cast was great but for the lack of dimension in the characters Gosling, could have used a B cast and saved money. The cinematography is the best part of the movie."
