" Big Shame
",-0.4767,-0.5548,2021-04-03 00:00:00,1,Truly awful. I had low hopes but was still underwhelmed. Annoyed I stuck with it. There's no redeeming features whatsoever and there's so many better options for low budget entertainment. I can't believe Samuel L jackson was in this let alone allowed it to see the light of day.
" Great family movie for older kids
",0.6249,0.9152,2021-04-03 00:00:00,8,"I watched this myself and thoroughly enjoyed it but I will watch again with my 12 and 9 year old. Film has action, humour and heart. And that beautiful scenery. üòçDefinitely on to watch."
" It's a unique thriller

A good plot, very attractive, holds us, the boy moves us, a true guardian, and not a killer hunter, the double is acting is very cute, passionate, the kid's duty to protect the president, very cute... Ownt... Very funny, don't wait for that comical, unpretentious air..."
" Plot Good, Physics Poor

" An unapologetically silly love letter to 90s action films filtered through the lens of a family adventure.
",0.765,0.9883,2020-12-25 00:00:00,7,"Oskari (Onni Tommila) is sent off to the woods to hunt as a right of passage to prove his manhood on his birthday. Unbeknownst to Oskari, William Alan Moore (Samuel L. Jackson), President of the United States, has abandoned Air Force One after it is taken down by terrorists. When the two meet up, the two teamup to try and survive the wilderness and takedown the terrorists.Directed by Jalmari Helander who directed Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale, crafts a film just as wonderful as his previous effort, and while it doesn't have the sharp edges and acerbic bite of his previous effort, he more than makes up for it by playing up the silliness of the situation while keeping it just grounded enough from jumping into outright parody. What Helander has done is take a traditonal wilderness coming of age story with hints of Jack London, and merged it with elements of 90s action blockbusters like Cliffhanger or Air Force One, and for the most part it succeeds.The movie despite being $10 million in budget, never feels cheap or slapdashed. The movie is well paced and acted with really good performances across the board from everyone involved. Onni Tommila does a really good job in the lead and makes us care about Oskari's journey in overcoming becoming an unlikely hero who's now tasked with saving the President of the United States. Jackson is equally good playing against type as rather meek and out of his element man completely unprepared for the harsh wilderness or bloodthirsty terrorist hunting him. Despite an outlandish premise of a child saving the President, the movie never feels overly self aware or silly. There are some very nice moments between Tommila and Jackson and they have a natural chemistry that comes through in their scenes.Some of the action feels a little restrained and two henchman are pointlessly shot fairly on which makes the threat feel slightly less urgent, but because this is a family film and it's trying to play itself at a level that can be enjoyed by everyone even children, this is a point where I feel I can give it a pass especially in comparison to films that tried and failed this approach such as Stormbreaker or Catch that Kid.Big Game is a movie that knows it's silly, but doesn't let that deter it from putting in effort. It's a very fun movie that hits all the right notes and exudes a love for both coming of age adventure stories as well as 90s action blockbusters of yesteryear. While it may be obviously holding back at a few key moments, it never feels toothless and is a movie that's just intense enough to be comfortably viewed by the whole family."
" A Young Spielberg is brewing in this Director!
",0.0,0.9416,2020-12-13 00:00:00,8,"I discovered Rare Exports a few years ago, and it became my favorite Christmas movie! Its a coming of age moment, blended with old mythology. Not horror to me...for me it carries that Spielberg vibe of young protagonist knowing the situation early on with adult disbelief. So often these come off as so bad and cheesey, but the director pulls it off with Rare Exports, and again with Big Game. I really want to commend Samual L. Jackson on taking on his role and trying to expose this writer/director. I recommend watching Big Game after Rare Exports because the main characters are the same, about 5 years apart. You will love it more if you watch Rare Exports first."
" Hollywood Has Fallen
",-0.3612,0.0728,2020-10-15 00:00:00,2,"I paid 25p in a charity shop for the DVD of this film, and it really wasn't worth the money. I can only take solace in the hope that my suffering alleviated someone else's. However, as ridiculous as this plot may be, it's nowhere near as ludicrous as the actual current presidency of the United States. This film might be a stinker but it's 'Trumped' by real life."

And, as usual, the ""bad guy"" is a British actor even though he is with the presidential security team !!But since kids don't pick up plot holes like adults do, they will not notice the gaping holes and many mistakes in this film ...like the plane lights of a submerged plane are still working, and swimming in a cold ""Finnish"" lake is not recommended !Hi, hum ...

" My opinion
",0.0,0.9926,2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Visually it's impressive, the cast are brilliant, the plot is good fun and the soundtrack is impressive. The first few minutes I didn't know what to expect but the pace moves it along nicely. My biggest issue is the age rating. This would have been alot better received had it been a family film and really the only thing that makes it inappropriate for kids is the swearing. The film is about a boy hunter seeking to become a man and carry a tradition but comes across the president and helps save him. Would have made a great PG action adventure movie but I think because of the age restriction aiming for older viewers with a child lead actor is probably what held the movie back. It is a nice watch tho. I'm glad I've seen it as its definitely a good movie. I give it a big thumbs up."

" ""My forest, my rules...""
",0.0,0.9865,2020-05-07 00:00:00,5,"Now I rather enjoyed this... OK, so it isn't going to trouble an Academy jury anywhere, but it is a good end-to-end action movie with bows and arrows - but not a sign of Robin Hood! Samuel L. Jackson is the President onboard Air Force One when it is attacked by a missile. He is bundled into his escape pod and lands in the midst of what turns out to be a Finnish forest. Meantime a local young lad is being trained by his father to be a hunter and so when he stumbles upon, and releases the President, they - together - have to try and find their way to a phone. Of course it isn't that simple - the President is being hunted; rather preposterously - like big game - by a Russian millionaire lunatic who is aided by a disaffected Secret Service agent who set the whole thing up in the first place (not a spoiler - we discover that very, very early on). The two now have to stay one step ahead of their pursuers with the help of the aforementioned bow and arrow, a shoe and an old fridge complete with some frozen venison. It's daft, with some really naff CGI - but Onni Tommila (""Oskari"") the young lad and SLJ gel well together, the latter is on good form with some quite witty one-liners and joyous facial expressions as I think even he realises just how silly this all is... Great fun, though - and I'd recommend if you've got ninety minutes to spare, and no particularly high expectations..."
" The Finland is the country of high mountains
",0.0,0.25,2020-05-06 00:00:00,4,"Well...
When the screenwriter set the action in some particular country, IMHO, he has to get general ideas about the location he is describing...
Isn't he/she?
I understand that 95% of the American public has no idea where Finland is and how does it look... but...
Probably, the rest 5% knows that Finish landscape is pretty flat and mostly consists of lakes and swamps"
" Very Bad!
",-0.623,-0.4376,2020-05-02 00:00:00,2,The film ist absolutely boring. Very unrealistic and nothing for people older than 16 Years!
" Don't worry, don't overthink, just enjoy
",-0.0572,0.9213,2020-04-21 00:00:00,7,"My wife and me simply enjoyed this peculiar take on an action movie/comedy - seen on TV in our case. I guess you need a sense for the slightly odd humour in this flick, which is neither really serious nor a parody in the usual sense. Unlikely elements abound, they're not mistakes but a gleeful play with the tropes of action and adventure movies. A few more serious undertones in a father-son relationship allow for some grounding of the boy's character. Conscious, enjoyable camp, well worth the 90 minutes duration, not overstaying its welcome."
" Big Fun
",0.5106,0.9493,2020-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Over the top action adventure comedy with Samuel L. Jackson sans profanity - which is pretty funny in and of itself.Air Force One is shot down over Finland, and the POTUS rescued by a 13 year old Finnish boy. That's the first 5 minutes - watch the rest and enjoy."
" Disappointing but made with a lot of heart
",-0.2732,0.9706,2020-03-28 00:00:00,4,"A young boy named Oskari (Onni Tommila) wants to follow in his fathers footsteps and become a skilled hunter. When camping alone in the woods as a coming of age ritual to find prey, Air Force One crash lands in the area and he finds himself on a rescue mission for the president of the United States (none other than Samuel L Jackson!) It goes without saying that Jackson playing the president is worth the ticket price alone and that is pretty genius casting! Tommila is also quite good as Oskari and the chemistry between the two main characters is pretty fun. Unfortunately the film does mainly reside in the action genre rather than comedy which would have been more engaging. There are undoubtedly impressive explosions but nothing to make it particularly stand out and the only thing that makes it shine is Jackson and Tommila together. Overall, it's not nearly as bombastically silly as the plot sounds which it could've done with but is clearly made with a lot of love for what it is"
" It's okay but not exactly stellar.
",0.1154,0.4019,2020-03-24 00:00:00,5,"For an effort by a country with a near non-existent film industry it's a genuinely well intentioned effort and impressive for the budget.

You get 110 minutes of dross.A truly awful movie. Only saving grace is the kid (who earnt the two stars on his own) Even Samuel L Jackson phoned it in on this one. Comic-book baddies and a plot line that was obvious within the first 15 minutes. A few nice shot of Finland but if that's what you want there must be a good travel doc out there somewhere. Avoid it."
" Great small budget action movie

Thats the whole point so it shouldn't be scored as a poor film. Enjoy it for what it is. An endearing action movie

This comic-book, cheesy style adventure aimed at kids is deliriously crackpot and far-fetched, with a goofy plot, though in its eagerness to entertain has many pleasing moments which lay mostly with the scene-stealing Onni Tommila."
" Great Light Entertainment
",0.7845,0.9911,2019-07-04 00:00:00,7,"I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. Take off your pseudo-critics hat and just sit back relax and enjoy. The movie is fun, the acting is good, and the movie has a great ending. Samuel Jackson plays a much different character than we're used to a really and it was refreshing and surprising at the same time. The young boy is very likeable and also delivers a good performance. I recommend this to viewers who want to be entertained by a movie, without agendas, vulgarity or politics. Good clean action comedy."
" Great Fun
",0.8126,0.9702,2019-07-04 00:00:00,7,"I love this film. Panned by the critics for some reason it has great pace, a great performance from Samuel Jackson and from Onni Tommila. The story is bonkers but that's what makes it such fun. One one level though it can be seen as a great take of the gang ho USA and their na√Øvet√© concerning world affairs. On another just enjoy the action."
" So bad it's, well, just bad
",-0.7369,0.4754,2019-06-29 00:00:00,3,"So glad that i only had to sit through this at home, if I'd had to actually part with money i may have had serious words with whichever cinema was silly enough to screen this.
A decent cast and what could possibly have been a decent storyline has been turned into a totally forgettable movie. I have just finished watching it and the only thing that i can think of is why Jim Broadbent, just why?"
" Failing at many levels
",-0.5106,-0.9281,2019-06-26 00:00:00,3,"What happened to Samuel L. Jackson? Why does he have to take a role in such a poor movie?
The story itself is pretty absurd, but it offered the potential for a fine B-Movie. It fails, because it totally lacks any irony, the cast doesn't suit the roles and the movie obviously needed to be family friendly.
I can imagine the story as a low budget movie with a whiny US-President and a tough Finnish hunter's boy, struggling for survival in the vast Finnish wilderness. With a suitable cast and the appropriate amount of violence and irony, this could have worked."
" The Hunt of a Lifetime
",0.0,0.1253,2019-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Samuel L. Jackson is quite restrained as the President of the United States, in Finnish director Jalmari Helander's ""Big Game,"" an offbeat but above-average thriller about a conspiracy to assassinate the Commander-in-Chief. On a flight to Helsinki to attend a summit, Air Force One is fired on by the son of a Saudi Prince, and President William Alan Moore is ejected in a capsule. Nothing the people aboard Air Force One can save themselves after the President and his Secret Service agents bail out. As it turns out, the leader of the President's bodyguards, Morris (Ray Stevenson of ""Punisher: War Zone"") is a disgruntled veteran who took a bullet for the President, and this flight represents his last mission before he must retire. The treacherous Morris has attached zip-ties to the Secret Service agents that bail out. Meaning, their chutes never deploy, and later we see their shattered bodies crumpled on rocks. As it turns out, Morris is in cahoots with Hazar, who launched the weapon that brought down Air Force One. Meantime, salvation awaits Moore in the form of a boy, Oskari (Onni Tommila), who has twenty-four hours to survive in the wilderness alone and return with a slain animal. This rites of passage is a traditional ceremony that each male member of his family has passed, and now he must face the perils of the wilderness. Oskari's doubtful father doesn't believe that his son can cut the mustard, so he leaves a freezer in the middle of nowhere with a slain animal in it. Initially, Oskari is cruising along on his four-wheeler towing a supply wagon, when Air Force One bears down on him and crashes into a lake. Oskari spots the capsule that Moore is in, and he punches up the correct code to release him. Moore and Oskari become friends as they brave the rigors of the cold and the mountainous terrain. At one point, they crawl into the freezer that Oskari's father left him, and they wind up plunging into a stream. While all this is going on, Morris links up with Hazar and they search for Moore. The best protection that Oskari can provide the President is his bow and arrow, but as a weapon it turns out to be largely ineffectual. The rugged scenery in ""Big Game"" is spectacular, and ""Iron Sky"" lenser Mika Orasmaa's widescreen cinematography is awesome. Enough surprises crop up in ""Big Game"" to make it work as an adventure. Stevenson makes a slimy villain."

" Doesn't stand apart from the crowd
",0.0,0.93,2018-01-13 00:00:00,5,"Big Game, the second film to be directed by Jalmari Helander, maintains the familiar style showcased in Rare Exports. Unfortunately Helander's debut film is far superior to this followup.The biggest problem that raises its head is the glaring similarity to the aforementioned Rare Exports. The characters, the tone, even the plot to some extent, are so obviously copy pasted that it feels like eating yesterday's soup, only with a heaping serving of water mixed in.Onni Tommila once again plays the lead as a young boy getting mixed in with something way beyond his head. And unfortunately in him culminate many of the mentioned problems about this being too similar. If you told me that this was the same kid from Rare Exports, I would have easily accepted it. They're so similarly written. But unfortunately this is supposed to be different kid and thus we end up going through all the same tired plot points about daddy issues, being insecure, trying to act tough and all that. Even in Rare Exports all that was the boring B-plotline, through which we had to suffer. In this it's just torturous.That being said, Tommila has charisma as an actor. Samuel L. Jackson is giving this perhaps 10 percent of his maximum effort, but it's at least something. Plus, the locations and inevitable explosions look nice - although they have nothing to do with actual Finnish Lapland. To see mountains like that you have to go to Norway. Or to the Alps, perhaps.Furthermore, to Helander's credit, his style is fun to watch. It's cheesy beyond all belief, but in a way that's easy to accept. So yeah, not exactly a great film, but if you liked Rare Exports, you might like this one okay."
" Pure, uncomplex and straightforward action entertainment
",0.4215,0.9972,2018-01-05 00:00:00,7,"In 2010 Jalmari Helander delivered one of the oddest but simultaneously most ingenious and refreshing horror movies of the new millennium with ""Rare Exports"". The success of that film was clearly big enough for him to get noticed in Hollywood and take a shot at making a large-budgeted blockbuster with A-listed actors. We see this happening a lot, by the way: young and creative non-American directors are plucked from their native countries after barely one hit and lured to Hollywood where their careers usually obstruct quickly because they are only allowed to direct lame remakes. But this is where it differs with Helander! Instead of going to Hollyood, Helander brought Hollywood to his beloved Finland for what is one of the most enjoyable, straightforward and unscrupulous action/adventure movies of the '10s. The story is simple yet delightfully far-fetched and over-the-top: 13-year-old Oskari is in the middle of performing a traditional Finnish manhood ritual when Air Force One gets shot out of the air on its way to Helsinki and crash-lands near the boy's hunting turf. Oskari rescues President William Alan Moore from his escape pod and swears to guide him back to civilization before his assailants find him and finish the job. ""Big Game"" has a couple of strong trumps, namely the chemistry between young Finnish actor Onni Tommila and veteran actor Samuel L. Jackson (in another fresh and surprising choice of role), the magnificently breath-taking Finnish filming locations (although largely filmed in Germany) and the purity of the screenplay. I love how Helander doesn't dive too much into themes like terrorism or overly convoluted conspiracy theories but opted for good old-fashioned and pulpy spectacle. Jackson's portrayal of the US President is also phenomenal. They are basically after him because he's an indecisive and cowardly leader. President Moore's toughest anecdote is a story about urinating in his pants and, in a way, undergoing the bravery ritual is as relevant to him as it is to Oskari. Obviously, there are several flaws in ""Big Game"" as well, notably how quickly everything and everybody gets tracked in these supposedly giant and impenetrable forests, but you'll gladly accept them. Thanks to the fast pacing, the compact running time and the thrilling special effects, ""Big Game"" is a massively enjoyable popcorn action flick that comes with my highest recommendation."
" Worst rating I think I've ever written.
",-0.6249,-0.3916,2017-12-26 00:00:00,3,"Some call it fun, I call it nonsense. That's what this is, nonsense. There's a major issue with the finished product here. Well there are several, but let's start with the problem with the concept.
This movie is clich√©d bullcrap. It's the kind of stuff that was dished out by that purveyor of delightful trash in the 80s Cannon only not as good and not as pure. I say unpure because the clich√©s in this movie seem like they are aimed at children. The highs and lows about a boy overcoming adversity to cheesy music is up there with Karate kid and Masters of the Universe..and maybe even Russkies (remember that one?). How many times can Samuel L Jaclson actually thank that brave fearless boy before all of the cheesey grins make us start to cheer for the baddies. That's if the baddies themselves didn't seem like they feell straight out of a 'Henchmen book for Dummies' which makes them just as annoying.
Anyway, thats the problem. This movie seems to be geared towards kids (half of what is passed as fact here is out-loud laughable). But clearly from the horrific violence and language simply isn't intended for a minor audience. The rating is 13 pg...but honestly, the rhetoric of a boys right of passage story seems meant for younger kids its that cringe worthy. The kind of people would think this is fun are people I would imagine who genuinely have the mind of a child (not a childish sense of humour and not some sort of nostalgic love of bad 80s movies). 
Its not a throwback to any genre or era. Its not Delta force or American Ninja. It has no depth. This can be made up with action, but when the cheesey cringey subplot kicks you in your sense of urgh every few minutes it just makes this movie fail on too many levels. Its a confused piece of badly written nonsense.. It not a nod to old fune movies, its just a confused, uncomfortable pile of bs. Which is a pity considering the mighty fine cast at hand. I've spent too much time writing this as it is...can't believe I stayed up to watch to this trite. Avoid."

It is pure 80s Hollywood cheese in the worst way, without any hint of a knowing wink to the audience that the film isn't taking itself too seriously. It takes itself entirely seriously, despite being utterly preposterous. Oh, and the music is equally awful. I will never get these 90 mins of my life back, don't make the same mistake."
" Excellent movie
",0.5719,-0.0516,2017-12-20 00:00:00,8,"I like it and I just started watching it. All the wanna be critics trashing this movie have no idea what an enjoyable movie is, and no idea how little of a minority they are. Put some pants on get out of your parents basement and go outside for a change."
" Sit back, relax and don't take it too seriously
",0.296,0.9809,2017-12-11 00:00:00,8,"Upon seeing the snapshot picture/poster for this movie, as well as the title, I decided to give it a go. At first, I wasn't too impressed; it wasn't the blockbuster I was expecting, especially with Samuel L. Jackson in it, playing the President of the United States. It was more of a movie aimed at teenagers to young adults; those who dream of meeting, even saving the President of the United States (whether you're American or not). I don't mind these kinds of movies if they're done well with a good cast.This is a family and son, coming of age kind of movie ‚Äì a boy must find himself under some of the roughest and most extraordinary conditions.I must say, though, that this movie is rather predictable, and you can tell who the protagonist is going to be before he even reveals himself. Also, you can guess who's joining him in this quest.The movie was slow at first (definitely not your regular blockbuster film), but slowly picked up the pace later on in the movie. In the end, the movie went pretty quickly! Could I handle more of it? Probably not. It was timed well!Saying all this, though, it was well-made, and it was refreshing to see a movie that is not your typical Hollywood blockbuster movie, and one that does not even take place anywhere near America, as so many do! Either that, or a made-up country. The casting directors did a good job with casting the actors, as they played their parts well.My scoring went along the lines of IMDb at first, but since sticking with the movie (I'm glad I did), my score rose, as I left this movie somewhat satisfied.Would I watch this movie again? Maybe. It's for sure on my rainy-day list! Would I recommend it to other people? Yeah.If you're going to take it too seriously and point out the plot-holes or improbability of some of the things/scenes in here, instead of what it is, which is a light-hearted movie, then it's probably best you look elsewhere."
" Ignorance irritates me
",-0.6369,-0.9166,2017-11-28 00:00:00,1,I hate when somebody (usually Americans) making movie about real world using real countries/towns names etc and they do not care if anything they show about real place it's true. They act like every watcher of their movie is an imbecile and know nothing about the world. I'm writing it because movie is placed in huge mountain range in Finland (It is not a spoiler cause this information is given in first 3 minutes of the movie) and THERE IS NO MOUNTAINS IN FINLAND AT ALL. This is not a secret knowledge at least they could write fricki'n Finland in google earth. So as I say Ignorance irritates me and I could not give any more than one to people that do not respect their watchers.
" Good over the top action flick
",0.5719,0.9862,2017-10-14 00:00:00,6,"Not every movie can or even should contain a dark, deep and serious story. This kind of campy movies are needed to keep the balance, I wish they would make more of these, perhaps a bit more balanced between drama and comedy. The silly lines delivered in this movies made me smile, mission accomplished. The whole situation they got into was silly, but that is why it works.I would like to enlighten a possible reader with a few points on how this movie was deliberately shows as to ""how Finland looks in American movies"". First of all, that is not how Lapland really looks like. Also they were flying to Helsinki and while still above Lapland, the pilot points out they are about ~45 miles to begin the landing to Helsinki, if that were minutes instead it might be more accurate. Those small lines make the whole point of how silly this movie is, in a good way.But the interesting thing is that there is swearing and some blood and gore in the movie. I would say this movie is somewhat a nod towards all the campy action movies that display world and situations in inaccurate ways, but still make them work.I can recommend this movie to anyone who seeks a change for all the over-dark stories in movies these days we are being flooded with.It is a solid six, fun to watch, campy, ridiculous situations, must have been fun to make."
" have they ever been to Finland
",0.0,0.3601,2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"for such a big Finnish crew I'm unsure if they have ever been to Finland..... we do not have mountains like in the film. we have loads of forest and lakes but no mountain ranges, just the odd mountain near the Norway - Sweden boarders. Although the wilderness adventures are portrayed to take place in Finnish Lapland, the outdoor footage in the film are from the Alps and the rest were filmed in Germany....... Lapland is flat....... but this was an enjoyable film if you forget this small issue lol ...."
" You'll do WHAT to the President?
",0.0,-0.9245,2017-08-31 00:00:00,8,Senseless fun. What more can I say. Probably not worth watching a second time round but definitely worth watching it once.I thought I'd seen it all. An Assassination attempt on the President? Old news. Kidnapping the President? Yawn. Never have I ever heard a terrorist say that he's got a taxidermist lined up to stuff the president.For that alone this gets an 8. If the President actually did end up getting stuffed I'd have given it a 10.
" President Samuel L Jackson rocks!
",0.0,0.9975,2017-08-09 00:00:00,9,"Quite possibly and highly probably Samuel L Jackson is the greatest and coolest president ever depicted on film.Big Game is old school action/adventure and a whole lot of fun, it takes me back to the days of Bruce Willis and Harrison Ford where the action was camp but so-so much better than it is today. Big Game doesn't try too hard, it's cheap-no thrills and that's what makes it so good. If you tried to analyse and pick the film apart then there wouldn't be a whole lot left, it has a lot of flaws but who cares, a proper popcorn munching, sit back and enjoy flick perfect for a rainy night. The story seems butchered, so basically a psychopath with no real motives wants the president as a trophy, to be stuffed like an animal and presented in his home for his friends to gaze at..., he's enlisted the help of an insider who works for the president by buying him off, and the duo set out to capture the most important man in the world. Applause must go out to the young Onni Tommila who plays the Finnish lad , this brave young guy saves the president initially and sticks with him throughout, time and time again being there for him, helping him escape capture and fight off the baddies..., the part was acted very well and Onni Tommila deserves commending.For the sake of not ruining a nice film, I'm not going to go into detail about the flaws and I'm not going to suggest any room for improvement, let it be and leave it as it is.Sam Jackson is one of my all time favourites, his screen presence is terrific and he has one of the most iconic and recognisable voices in cinema, a perfect fit to play a very different president and to give his own unique spin on the role."
" This is a movie for boys of all ages, but it contains little of value, other than some suspension in the action scenes.
",0.3984,0.9314,2017-08-08 00:00:00,4,"A film that is supposed to show Finland, the land of the thousand lakes, but show the German Alps and a scenery you will have an incredibly hard time finding in Finland. It's like filming a movie about Wall Street in New Dehli. The film contains one token female, the CIA director. The coming of age ritual is stupid and shallow as presented, but so are the Finns that surround the boy - except for his hero father. The mother - or other women in Finland - are never mentioned. But then again neither are the saunas, which shows how little this film is about Finland, in addition to the topographic blunder.This is a movie for boys of all ages, but it contains little of value, other than some suspension in the action scenes. I like some of the one liners, and some of the way the boy acts, but it is hard to see that a boy who starts as a weak loser who is only too aware of his short comings, can suddenly - in the middle of the German (""Finlandian"") wilderness - become so street smart and over power a state leader in rhetoric and puns, and that in an English too good for a Finn hunter boy of 13.I know, this is a movie for boys, I know, and yet I would have hoped for more depth and realism, so that there was more tension and actual suspense, so that we were actually a little scared and moved emotionally. Or, the action could have been taken to an even funnier caricature, made more cartoon like and given us more laughter. As it is, the movie falls between two chairs."
" Way more fun then I expected
",0.5563,0.979,2017-06-26 00:00:00,7,"Always good if your expectations are not that high. Because it is way better then that. Don't take it to seriously. Yes, they are maybe B actors but to be honest very good B actors. The action is very good, Special effects nothing to complain about. A movie about a boy that has to do some hunting to become a man. And he will hunt. A lot to laugh or at least smile about.There is really only one thing that is bad about it. The landscape is not Finland."
" Not good not bad somewhere in between.
",-0.5824,-0.3926,2017-05-05 00:00:00,6,"Well the thing that don't understand why the did not make it a children's movie. It would by for children a really good movie a young boy saves the president form the bad guys. Unfortunately it is definitely not a movie for children and nobody seems in this movie have a clue if there are performing in a comedy or in action thriller. I don't now why but i can hate this movie it's annoying sometimes, but over all it's fun to watch."
" Absolutely loved every moment
",0.6361,0.974,2017-02-14 00:00:00,10,"I have seen this film a number of times now, and have not grown to become sick of it.First review I write, will recommend this to any family and anybody great movie one of the best Disney movies I've watched...Brought my kids to watch it and think I enjoyed itGive much props to writers producer and all involved well made and put together probably best movie and there are plenty of good ones out there. one of the best stories presented on the big screen in the past decade, unbelievable acting by each and every member of the cast.Rating isn't everything this movie is one of the best I have ever seen, and in the end It made me cry. Ovbiously, this movie isn't as perfect as Hollywood Oscar winners but It deserves many Oscars. While the topic of the movie is serious, the movie is very funny and also involves action.i just can say that you have to watch this movie. just go and watch it, it makes you happy at the end."
