" Suave and sweet
",0.7184,0.9926,2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,"A simple film about Mr. Sherlock Holmes at the end of his life in the countryside in his personal estate with a caretaker who is an RAF widow with her son who must be around 12 or 13. Sherlock Holmes is just back from Japan where he has met a man who claims a little bit loudly to be an admirer. Sherlock Holmes in his mythical cult of truth nearly blows it up but he manages to fall back on his feet and keep his balance. Who cares whether the man is a fantasizer or not? As long as he is hurting no one.The actor is very good as for that, learning how to stop being the truthful prick Sherlock Holmes has always been. The boy on his estate, Roger, is fascinated by Sherlock Holmes and his discovery of dead bees on the beehives behind the house makes him look for the enemies of the bees, hence the wasps, and he finds the nest, and he tries to get too close, and he is attacked and stung many times. He is rushed to the hospital and will manage to get through it. In other words, he was not allergic.It is probably with such an event that Sherlock Holmes finally understands that at the end of his life he has to freewheel a little bit and relax too. But the two actors for Mr. Holmes and Roger, one a confirmed adult and the other one a young actor starting an early career are the real strong heart of the film. The two playing together, playing with one another, both accomplices and competitors, make the film very entertaining. The wasp's incident tells the old man he has to do something else to bring his life to a satisfactory end. So, he writes a letter to his Japanese friend or host and tells him a totally fictional episode about his father serving the British crown in a totally secret, top-secret mission of several years. It is a purely fictional letter, but he knows his Japanese friend will cherish it like gold.At the same time, he decides to leave the estate entirely to his caretaker and her son and some arrangement about a fund for the son's coming years. He then can go into the meadow and surround himself with a circle of stones representing the people who have been important in his life. Yet he refuses to include Roger in the circle because Roger has a life ahead of him and cannot be included in the past of Sherlock Holmes. That's purely suave but it is sweet and heartful.Of course, ""The man beyond the myth of Sherlock Holmes"" is an absolute lie because there is no man behind, beyond, or under the Myth of Sherlock Holmes since Sherlock Holmes is a fictional being that has captured some mythical importance in the psyche of millions of people. The man then is just another myth over or under the fictional mythical character. But it is fun to imagine what such a man could have become in his old age.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
" Nice Movie
",0.4215,0.8139,2021-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Nice really sums this up. If you are looking for a really interesting mystery this really is not it. It is more about Holmes coming to terms with getting old and losing his memory, something that obviously was so key to him and his life and career. Really touching, beautifully shot, beautifully acted. A slow burner but worth the watch."
" Mr. Holmes
",0.0,-0.9783,2021-01-30 00:00:00,6,"I had missed this film a good number of times when it had been broadcast on television, and I really, didn't want to keep doling so, so I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to watch it, directed by Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters, Kinsey, Dreamgirls). Basically, set in 1947, the long-retired Sherlock Holmes (Sir Ian McKellen), aged 93, lives in a rural Sussex farmhouse with his widowed housekeeper Mrs. Munro (Laura Linney) and her young son Roger (Milo Parker). His memory is slowly failing, so starts to use the prickly ash plant he acquired from his recent trip to Hiroshima to try to improve it. Holmes has read the book The Adventure of the Dove Grey Glove, a fictionalised version of his last case, written by his former partner Dr. John Watson (Colin Starkey), and he is not happy with it. Talking to someone, he also confirms that him wearing a deerstalker is also fictional ""embellishment"". He hopes to write his own account, but has trouble recalling the events. Holmes spends more time with Roger, while he takes care of his apiary (beehives), he appreciates Roger's curiosity and intelligence and forms a paternal liking to him. As time goes by, Roger's prodding helps Holmes remember the case (shown in flashbacks), he is sure he failed somehow, resulting in his retirement from detective investigation. Almost 30 years earlier, after the First World War had ended and Watson had married and left Baker Street, Holmes was approached by Thomas Kelmot (Patrick Kennedy) to follow his wife Ann (Hattie Morahan), who had become become estranged from him after suffering two miscarriages. Holmes observed her seemingly preparing to murder her husband, with suspicious activities including forging her husband's name to cash cheques, confirming the details of his will, buying poison, paying a man, and checking train schedules. Holmes however discovered her true intention, to have gravestones made for her and her miscarried children and then kill herself. Confronting her, Holmes confessed he had the same feelings of loneliness and isolation. Ann asked Holmes if they could share the burden of their loneliness together. Holmes was tempted, but instead advised her to return to her husband. She poured away the poison, thanked Holmes, and departed. Holmes later learned that Ann persisted in killing herself by stepping in front of an oncoming train. Blaming himself, he retired and fell into a deep depression. Watson briefly returned to care for him and, discovering the details of the case, wrote the tragedy to become a success in his book. In more flashbacks, Holmes recounts a recent trip to Japan, where he met supposed admirer Tamiki Umezaki (Hiroyuki Sanada) who had told him of the benefits of prickly ash. In fact, Umezaki wanted to confront him, as years before, Umezaki's father had gone to England on business and never returned, after the great detective Sherlock Holmes had convinced him to stay on there and forget his family in Japan. To Umezaki's disappointment, Holmes told him bluntly that his father probably just wanted a new life for himself and that he had never met the man. In the present, Mrs. Munro grows dissatisfied with work as Holmes becomes more difficult to look after. His closeness to her son Roger is another source of tension, as the boy increasingly distant from his mother. Mrs. Munro accepts a job at a hotel in Portsmouth and plans to take Roger with her. Roger is unwilling to leave Holmes and tells his mother that he doesn't want to go. Later, Holmes discovers Roger lying unconscious in the garden, covered in insect stings. He is rushed to hospital. Distraught, Mrs. Munro accuses Holmes of caring for nothing but himself and his bees and douses the apiary in flammable liquid. Holmes stops her, realising that the stings are wasps not bees, Roger disturbed their nest nearby and tried to drown them to protect the apiary, they swarmed on him. Holmes and Mrs. Munro set the wasps' nest alight together and return to the hospital as Roger regains consciousness. As they sit in the waiting room, Holmes tells Mrs. Munro about his selfishness and talks about Ann Kelmot. He wants her and Roger to stay in his life and tells her that he is leaving them his house and possessions after he dies. Back home, Holmes writes his first fictional work, and Roger begins to teach his mother how to care for the bees. Holmes also emulates a tradition he saw practised in Hiroshima so that he can recall the loved ones he has lost over the years. Also starring Roger Allam as Dr. Barrie, Frances de la Tour as Madame Schirmer, Phil Davis as Inspector Gilbert, and John Sessions as Mycroft Holmes. McKellen (with his large slightly extended nose) gives a pretty good performance as the elderly famous detective trying to find his way, Linney is reasonable as his housekeeper but her wobbly Irish accent is distracting, and young Parker is likeable as the curious boy. The pace of this is mostly slow, there are the odd moments that got my attention, especially the wasp stinging scene, and the cinematography and costume design is good, it a gentle and relatively interesting period mystery drama. Good!"
" Very entertaining fine performances
",0.6453,0.9891,2021-01-21 00:00:00,7,"My Review - Mr Holmes
My Rating. 7/10I finally caught up with this 2015 movie starring Ian McKellen as Sherlock Holmes and a favourite actress of mine Laura Linney as Mrs Munro his housekeeper in the Sussex village the very elderly Holmes has retired to to spend his last days.
Sherlock Holmes is dealing with early dementia, as he tries to remember his final case, and a mysterious woman, whose memory haunts him. He also befriends a fan, the young son of his housekeeper, who wants him to work again.
The son Roger played so beautifully by Milo Parker forms a special bond with the elderly Holmes . I'm so impressed with the quality of some child actors today . It amazes me the depth of character they achieve. I wish someone would make a documentary on the modern acting coaching techniques of these young people . It's a far cry from some of the sickly sweet artificial child performances of the Golden years of Hollywood.
Sir Ian McKellen the most Stately Homo
in England gives one of his finest recent performances as Sherlock .
He was quoted as saying that it was easy for him to imagine Sherlock Holmes as a real person, since the majority of this movie is set during his own lifetime, and he could have met Sherlock as a boy in 1947, just like Roger.
Set in 1947 Sherlock Holmes finds himself haunted by a thirty-year old case. Holmes memory isn't what it used to be, so he only remembers fragments of the case: a confrontation with an angry husband, and a secret bond with his beautiful, but unstable wife.
Based on a novel by Mitch Cullin ""A Slight Trick of the Mind"" the screenplay by Jeffrey Hatcher and Direction by Bill Condon is very effective as we travel back and forth in time to show Sherlock Holmes in his Prime and his last troubled years.
Bee keeping plays an interesting role in this movie and it was interesting to read that Sir Ian McKellen took a course in beekeeping with The London Honey Company prior to filming and he was not stung during filming.
The movie is beautifully filmed the beach and cliff scenes took part in Seaford near the Cuckmere River, which also lends its name to the fictional train station to which Holmes travels.
I really enjoyed this film and can highly recommend it."
" A mixed blessing
",0.4939,0.9973,2021-01-19 00:00:00,5,"I've now seen this film twice and enjoyed it on both occasions. Ian McKellen was the ideal choice for the role of Sherlock Holmes in old age., but there were some puzzling aspects to the plot(s). Things didn't quite match up. For help, I consulted the entry in Wikipedia, which provided a certain degree of assistance but still left me a little perplexed about the basic point of the film.Finally, I read the original novel by Mitch Cullin, 'A Slight Trick of the Mind', which is beautifully and sensitively written. I found that the film-makers had taken a huge number of liberties with the author's plot and greatly distorted things in the process. muffling his original intentions and opting, inevitably perhaps, for a happy ending. Irrelevant bits and pieces had been inserted, moreover, which - while enjoyable enough in themselves, and sometimes quite amusing - were intended, basically, to ""pander to the gallery"". The producers had opted for an easy way out and were bearing in mind the potential box-office takings.There are three separate narratives, in three different time-frames, being developed in the story. It might have been helpful, and more in the spirit of the book, if it had been filmed in a black-and-white format - and even, indeed, if the different narratives had been gently tinted in different colours, as a way of distinguishing between them. Ideally, the production should have been undertaken by a modern-day Ingmar BergmanI won't spoil matters by going into precise details as to how the film differs from the book, but would strongly urge people to read the latter before reaching a final judgment. I readily concede that the film as such is extremely enjoyable. But if it had truly reflected the author's intentions then it could also have been a great one."
" Slow and considered - Holmes fan should appreciate it as something different
",0.6124,-0.9071,2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Where as the new Enola Holmes is all about looking forward with relentless energy and challenging peoples expectations of what you may be.This is about reflection, consolidating an coming to terms with what people expect you to be.This is quite melancholy, slow and considered.
I never found this boring though as the performances are very good.
Laura Liney does an especially professional job as a background character that holds the rest of the story together.There are a couple of mysteries to work out but nothing that is really going to tax an armature sleuth - this is not a typical ""solve the murder"" affair.I enjoyed this greatly - but be warned this is quite down-beat and there is not much action - the only real protagonist is time and Holmes's failing faculties."
" More of a delicate appraisal of the frustrations of the ageing process than a story of ""Sherlock Holmes""
",-0.3657,0.9668,2021-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Sometimes, I wonder if there are two Sir Ian McKellen's. One - on stage - is vivid and compelling; the other - on film - increasingly seems content to just play an old man. Sadly, this is much more of the latter as he portrays the ailing super sleuth writing a memoir of his last case to correct what he saw as the contemporary, but flawed, embellishments of his late colleague ""Dr. Watson"", mingled with some real-time retrospectives of his recent visit to Hiroshima where he acquired a jelly that might help his failing memory to recover. It's not without some humour, and features quite an engaging performance from a young Milo Parker as ""Roger"", the son of his sceptical housekeeper (Laura Linney) to whose house he has retired. The young lad shows a keen interest in ""Holmes"" and his beekeeping and the pair start to bond as his failing health causes increasing frustration and exasperation as he writes and remembers in fits and starts. It has been crafted with great care, and there is a gentle elegance in the style of production, but the story is fairly weak and the pace ponderous to the point where it becomes a bit of a drudge. Sir Ian does have a certain glint in his eye at times, but it's not really enough to carry this."
" The slow death of Holmes!
",-0.636,-0.2118,2021-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Do I really want to watch a Holmes with onset Dementia and about to die at any moment. No. Of course the story and acting are all excellent and we see some flashes of the alert Holmes. Yet it is typically current BBC - too much death in the air, too much of miserable decline. Holmes is about energy, action, fast turns of thought and never sentimentality. I can't ever imagine Holmes looking after bees for 30 years!
There is no Dr Watson. The little boy is a substitute I suppose. Holmes and Watson go together. So altogether why? No adventure, though plenty emotional incident. Holmes has become emotional. Very BBC.
Can't fault the acting but not a Holmes film I would ever want to watch again because it isn't a Holmes film."
" Slow, dull and boring
",-0.6124,0.1406,2021-01-01 00:00:00,1,"As a massive Holmes fan, I was keen to watch this. Sadly, it starts off slowly and never picks up the pace. Endless scenes about nothing in particular."
" The Beekeeper
",0.0,-0.0498,2021-01-01 00:00:00,7,"People are inclined to forget that Holmes & Watson were only in their twenties when they first met in 'A Study in Scarlet. Nearly twenty years after depicting another distinguished gentleman in his twilight years in 'Gods & Monsters', Ian MacKellen & Bill Condon were reunited to continue the story of Sherlock Holmes - now 93 years old and still keeping bees - in a 'contemporary' setting now as long ago as the original stories in 'The Strand', when Conan Doyle himself would by then have been dead for 17 years.)For once the story is told from the point of view of Holmes himself rather than Watson, and the actual mystery he recalls is less interesting than the present-day calamity involving bees he brings his deductive reasoning to in the present day. When Holmes finally deigns to see himself represented on the big screen it's not Basil Rathbone he sees (as it would almost certainly have been in 1947), but a pastiche called 'The Lady in Grey', featuring Frances Barber as a notably venomous dragon lady (or - in this particular telling - queen bee)."
" Sherlock Holmes and the Mystery of his retirement...
",0.0,0.9477,2021-01-01 00:00:00,9,"As well written a Shelock tale as Sir Arthur ever wrote.The premise is what happens to the mind of a genius like Holmes when he faces his deadliest foe, Dementia.
This movie is inch perfect. It's performances, narrative, direction and pace are fantastic.
Stand out is Sir Ian who reminds us all how fantastic an actor he is by shifting gears as Sherlock the Sharp to Holmes the elderly male grasping for clues in the mists of his mind.
I loved it."
" Sherlock Holmes and lots of bees
",0.0,0.1017,2021-01-01 00:00:00,3,"A strange, melancholy story of Sherlock Holmes's old age. He is living in the country with his grumpy housekeeper and her young son. Not a great deal happens, and unless you are very interested in bees there isn't much to see here. I was hoping for something a bit more interesting, but instead it's just bees, bees,, bees, all the way. I managed to stay awake until the end, but only just."
" Mr Holmes
",0.0,0.981,2020-07-14 00:00:00,7,"Propelled by the sheer force of Ian McKellen's solid, nuanced and realistic performance and some beautiful and lyrical cinematography, 'Mr. Holmes' successfully explores the lights and shadows of the famous Baker Street detective who is now ageing and living in retirement as he attempts to remember his last case. The film thus establishes a dialogue between the past, the present and the future. 'Mr. Holmes' may lack the thrills that characterise other Sherlock adaptations, but it focuses instead on the man behind the myth with his defects, his regrets and his mistakes. This choice alone has interesting results. For example, the film deftly brings the iconic character to the real world just as it examines the powerful role that fiction plays in our lives as well as other graver themes like the nature of life and death. An important element which helps the film achieve these goals is Milo Parker's excellent work as the boy, which results in very believable, satisfying and sometimes poignant scenes between him and McKellen. Although there are some pacing issues as well as some questionable camera moves, especially in the first 30 minutes which may make the film feel a bit slow and wooden, the film's flaws are outweighed by the character-driven plot, some nice symbolism and imagery and a beautifully constructed ending which brings everything full circle and launches an uplifting message of hope and reconciliation.Grade: 7.1 / 10"
" Unwatchable
",0.0,-0.2902,2020-06-12 00:00:00,3,"Sir Ian is one of my favorite actors so I was enthusiastic to watch this movie. Plus, I have long been a Sherlock Holmes fan, and I have enjoyed other recent movies and tv shows that offer modern takes on this iconic character.After slow start, the plot got even slower. I could tolerate the drawn out conversations, until the annoying housekeeper started squashing her son's intellectual development. Laura Linney, an American actress, was not right for this role.Still, the period decor and scenery was nice, so I was planning to finish watching the movie, although my mind wandered for several large chunks. Then the movie just started getting sad. There wasn't anything exciting about the mystery, nor was there any thrilling detective work. There was a whole lot of watching Sherlock Holmes' increasing confusion and dementia, which just made him look pathetic and sad. It reminded me of all the people I've seen decline with this horrible disease.The movie was too much of a downer for me to finish watching and I stopped after about 2/3 of it. I do not plan on watching it again."
" What happens when the greatest mind gets old?
",0.6369,0.9934,2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,"I love this movie. The story is so powerful. It explores a side of the character we don't see often. What if he were to lose his most powerful tool? (That is, his mind, of course). Is such a powerful struggle. You can feel for him, you can relate to the part of getting old, thinking about how things can turn out to be, how many regrets will you have. Cause even the most brilliant mind in the world would have that as well... such a great idea all throughout.Soundtrack is amazing, is so smooth and it gives a great atmosphere to the whole movie.The acting is phenomenal, Ian McKellen is great in it, Laura Linney is amazing too, and the kid Milo Parker is really good as well. Roger's chemistry with Holmes is honestly one of my favorite parts of the film. They are great.
It's so cute, and a beautiful detail how he talks about Watson, even though we never actually see his face.The case he tells the story throughout the movie is also great, I think it completes the rest of the film perfectly, it's a smart and investing story, you are at all times wanting to see what happens next (as all great Sherlock Holmes' stories). You have a main plot of an old genius, trying to deal with the fact that he live is getting to an end, and he isn't the same as he once was, which is great and touching, and also, you have a side story of a great great case, you are always wanting to know how it ends. It's a perfect mix.If I were to say something that wasn't as good it would be most of the Japan scenes, at the end, you get a good wrap up of the story with Sherlock coming to terms with it all, and well, I guess you could say that makes it worth it (and it's a fair point, maybe it does). However, is definitely the less strong.At the end, you get invested in the story, you want him to remember it, you want him to be the old Sherlock (not the older...), but maybe the old Sherlock isn't the best one after all..."
" One of the Best Holmes Screen Adaptations
",0.6369,0.9951,2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"A heartfelt mystery drama, Mr. Holmes is a character study wrapped in a mystery. It' about Holmes' character not the mystery and how he solves it. It's complicated, but it's a great film, especially if you're a Holmes fan.Ian McKellen is excellent as Sherlock Holmes, and not only does he have the task of portraying one of literature's greatest characters, he also has to portray him losing his mind. Indeed we see Holmes becoming more old and frail with time, and his mind begins to unravel as is the case many people with advanced age. McKellen perfectly captures this, and makes the film a joy to watch as well as heartbreaking.This is still the same old Holmes we have come to know and love, but it's also a new Holmes. He is humanized here, and not the young, frenetic, eccentric Holmes that is often portrayed in TV adaptations. This isn't the RDJ version either. This is a weaker Holmes who is struggling with old age, and it's fascinating.Milo Parker is one of the finest child actors I've ever seen, and the character of Roger Munro that he plays is well fleshed our, as is his mother, Mrs. Munro, player by the ever under-appreciated Laura Linney.The mystery is interesting and engaging, more so since it's told in flashbacks and not the movie's focus. It's not a Holmes story without a mystery, so we're given one to sink our teeth into if the heavy drama and portrait of old age and its struggle is either not enough or too much for some.Definitely check this out, it's a worthy representation of the classic character, which manages to make its new portrayal interesting while still respecting the source material for the character."
" Novel in idea but unfocussed and dull in execution
",-0.4404,0.987,2020-04-17 00:00:00,5,"Well into retirement, Sherlock Holmes reminisces about his final case.A novel idea - Sherlock Holmes's life post-retirement, a plot nobody has ever covered. Throw in the intrigue of his final case and the sentimentality of the sub-plot involving his housekeeper and her son and this had the potential to be a great movie.However, it never fulfils that potential. The last case intrigue doesn't really go anywhere, the retirement phase is an interesting backdrop and provides for some empathetic moments towards Holmes but it is nothing more than that. Throw in Holmes's trip to Japan and a plot that is constantly flicking between all these sub-plots and it all seems quite unfocussed and a bit dull.On the plus side, the housekeeper-and-son sub-plot was interesting and provides for the most engaging and emotional moments of the film. Ian McKellen delivers a great performance as Holmes, especially as he plays him at a few points in his life, with differing levels of health. 12-year-old Milo Parker puts in a good performance as the boy.Overall, it's too dry and unfocussed to maintain any degree of engagement."

I also quite like the concept that even the world's sharpest detective falls victim to old age, like everyone else. Otherwise, Sir Ian Mckellen's Sherlock is great, as is the relationship with the boy who 'conducts' the case since Sherlock's memory is failing him. I remember thoroughly enjoying both the cinematography and composition as well as the overall story."

" Magnificent McKellen

Playing the role of Sherlock over a span of 30 years, McKellen shows why he is in the pantheon of cinema's greatest actors.
So mesmerising is his portrayal that all facets of this film it seems also rise to the occasion. Cinematography, script and acting by all members of the cast can barely be faulted.
A gem of a movie."

An act of imagination for an actor, a myth reacting against his on his own myth. But oftentimes the film business will try to be too clever with de-mythologizing icons. Holmes is too pathetic here and it rings false he was done in by some random case that wasn't even very interesting; but was that the whole point that he's human and fallible to the same obsessions and regrets? But then surely those other cases would've done it long ago? I'm not sure I bought this rendition of a great intellect, with how eccentric and alienating the geniuses are, he just seems a bit stingy. Laura Linney always plays a killjoy, and I groan whenever her name pops up in the credits. I hoped the film would be lighter and funnier."

",0.0,-0.9352,2019-01-26 00:00:00,8,"The more recent adaptations of the Sherlock Holmes character in film have been quite interesting. The Robert Downey Jr. versions offers an accomplished martial artist, while this Ian McKellen translation serves up a thoughtful but sometimes depressing rendering of a man on the brink of senility. The story itself is quite good, with a major plot point involving Holmes' attempt to recall his last case and struggling to do so. I was somewhat amused by, and had never given it a second thought before, the idea of Holmes' preference for a top hat and cigar which were diametrically opposed to the more familiar aspect of deerstalker and pipe. The story's only mentions of his former partner and sidekick Dr. Watson were to allusions that suggested he embellished some of Holmes' investigations with a bit of poetic license by straying from the facts. Given Holmes' predilection for success, it wasn't altogether surprising that he would have been distressed over the apparent failure to recognize Ann Kelmot's (Hattie Morahan) depression regarding that last case of his; it was what drove him to a premature retirement. And it did bother me in the other flashback scenario involving the Japanese diplomat Masuo Umezaki (Zak Shukor), that Holmes' recommendation was that he inform his wife that he would be gone for a very long time (and probably never return). Combined with the near tragedy of losing his youthful companion Roger (Milo Parker), it wasn't unusual that the closing scene captured the inestimable Sherlock Holmes atoning for what would have been considered a life lived just a bit too logically."
" A paradoxical review
",0.0,0.9778,2018-12-25 00:00:00,7,"My own memory of this film is very fuzzy, I saw it back when it first came out for rental 2016? It seemed a fun and pleasant enough movie. Clever but not really memorable. I really want to respond to the initial review I saw which went on and on about how good movies don't need CGI, etc, etc. This movie happens to have a cameo by Nicholas Rowe, who played Sherlock in (the much more memorable) ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" (1985), which contains some of the first CGI in a non-science-fiction Hollywood movie. Here he appears as the 47 year old Holmes in a documentary movie within the movie. I'd like to say it's a delicious irony, but that's not really the meaning of irony. At least it's a morsel for IDBM film detectives to appreciate!"
" Sir Ian McKellen
",0.0,0.8744,2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that retirement is not for everyone. The direction and screenplay are both really good. The casting and acting are both really good also. Especially by Sir Ian McKellen as a long since retired Sherlock Holmes. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Pleasant
",0.5106,0.9895,2018-10-10 00:00:00,7,"In the late 1940s, Sherlock Holmes (Ian McKellen) is in his 90s. He has just returned from a trip to Japan and is settling in his beautiful farmhouse on the southern England coast where he maintains a bee colony enthusiastically. His only companions are his housekeeper (Laura Linney) with whom he has a cordial but cold connection; and her young son Roger (Milo Parker) with whom he bonds quite amicably.Based on the novel ""A Slight Trick of the Mind"" by Mitch Cullin, the story is much different from what one would expect in a Holmes film. It does include a mystery story but it is briefly told in flashback. In addition to another flashback story (the recent trip to Japan ), the focus is more on Holmes' deteriorating health including a fading memory of a once brilliant mind.Director Bill Condon also worked with McKellen in the superb ""Gods and Monsters"" (1998) in which McKellen gave a brilliant performance. While the role in ""Mr. Holmes"" is much less dramatic, the collaboration works well again as McKellen is very convincing as a former champion having to adjust to more modest circumstances while occasionally showing that his astute and observant mind still works well on occasion.Overall, there is a beautiful mood of melancholy in the film which matches its lovely setting. Other themes include regret, guilt, and loss - both past and impending. While it does not have the thrills of a suspenseful murder mystery, it is still a pleasant and enjoyable film."
" Had potentials wanted more
",0.0,0.4491,2018-09-24 00:00:00,5,"It is a movie that really had the potentials to Be really great. The acting was perfect, the story could have been interesting but got a bit boring. I wanted more ""Sherlock"" and there was almost none."
" A Slight Trick of the Mind
",-0.0516,-0.1681,2018-01-26 00:00:00,6,"Sherlock Holmes (Ian McKellen) is aged up, living in retirement, tending to his bees in the country. He tries to remember his last case from 30 years ago the outcome of which was changed by Dr Watson in his writings. The case concerned a man who consulted Mr Holmes about his wife who miscarried twice. Holmes observes that she wishes to do harm to her husband but later realises that she wishes to kill herself.Looking after him is his housekeeper, Mrs Munro (Laura Linney) and her young son Roger (Milo Parker.) However the housekeeper is worried about her future where Holmes is getting increasing decrepit and she is looking for another job. Holmes on a visit to Japan is looking for a substance to rejuvenate his memories where he also meets a man who thinks that Holmes once knew his father.Sherlock also finds time to see himself on celluloid as his adventures were adapted for the movies, played badly by an actor (Nicholas Rowe, reprising his role three decades after Young Sherlock Holmes.)This is an elegant film with a buzz about McKellen's performance. However it is a slight film that does wrap up its various plot lines very neatly."
" A Retired Sherlock Fights A Failing Mind...
",-0.7184,0.9987,2018-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Sherlock Holmes has been retired for thirty years. Upon finally reading Dr John Watson's stories for the first time along with watching a ""Talking Picture"" depicting his last adventure, Sherlock decides to write the truth about his last case. Dr Watson had always been liberal with the facts, for entertainment's sake. Though, the last case is niggling at Sherlock's deteriorating mind... It must have been very important as it made him turn his back on the profession he loved. Will there be enough time to get it all down on paper before his memory fails completely?This is a nice ""What If?"" story. Writer, Mitch Cullen (who wrote the novel) and screenplay writer Jeffrey Hatcher do no disservice to the character Arthur Conan Doyle created. This is still the same Sherlock Holmes of the stories, though older, but maybe not wiser. Ian McKellen was a perfect choice for this aged character and he gives a brilliant portrayal. Though it's Laura Linney who surprised me the most. For me, she's never been a draw. However, I am pleased to say that as Mrs Munro, Sherlock's housekeeper, she is great. There was a slight moment when we first meet her and her accent slips into across between American and North Country. However, this is only for a few seconds. From there on in her accent is pretty good. Not perfect, though, not bad. One of my favourite scenes in the film is when Mrs Munro is discussing her late husband with her son, Roger (Parker). When Roger asks her if she's good at making up stories, her reply and the look on her face, along with the pregnant pause, really does show a whole range of emotions in just a few scant seconds - very well done. Milo Parker is a very strong actor who had to contend with working with a great cast, which he did seamlessly. The director, Condon, did a great job of not letting the character of Roger steal the show, which could have easily happened.Condon also does a fantastic job of filming. Using camera shots to add atmosphere and show locations to their best advantage. The part where Sherlock follows Anne Kelmot (Morahan) through London is a perfect example. The scene at the train station where she makes a pay-off is one of my favourites in the film. What with the steam filling the platforms and the shots looking between the moving carriages. It really does set the scene well.To be honest, I really couldn't find anything wrong with either the story or the film. As I've said before, I am not a fan of flashbacks. Though here they are used to tell Sherlock's last case as he tries to remember it and write it down. Then you have the remembrances of Japan where Sherlock has recently been looking for a remedy to his failing memory. These are expertly told and done in such a way that adds power and depth to the story... not confusion, which is the case with a lot of films. In a lot of movies, flashbacks add a disjointed feeling to the pace and structure. Luckily for the viewer, Condon is a master at weaving them into the story with seemingly effortless ease.This film is a must-see for all Sherlock fans, Mystery Lovers, Thriller Fans, and Armchair Detectives everywhere. This hasn't made it into my top ten movies, though I have to admit I'll watch it again... I may even consider buying a copy."
" Why only 6.9 stars?
",0.0,0.9812,2018-01-15 00:00:00,10,"The IMDb ratings are often useful, but the ratings on this one are way off.This is a gentle film that shows old world kindness, perfectly drawn character, beautiful photography and a ripping good story. Watch it, and if you do not like it get help."
" Elementary that you should give this a miss!
",-0.2598,0.6745,2018-01-15 00:00:00,2,"What a load of incomprehensible claptrap! Ian McKellen is a very good actor but this was full of very good actors that were not even given one minutes screen time. It is hailed as the mystery of his last case - what last case? There was no mystery as to what happened. 
And as for Holmes visiting a remarkable undamaged Nagasaki only two years after the atomic bomb - what? In fact you could have cut the whole Japanese content and made not a jot of difference to the film.
This was just a shabby attempt to lure people using the Sherlock Holmes angle, and it turned into a maudlin heap of nothing."
" A dark sunset for Mr. Holmes
",0.0,0.6659,2018-01-10 00:00:00,4,"And oddly depressive film featuring the great Ian MacLennan and Laura Linney. Not forgetting the child actor, Milo. All doing their very best with a plot that is tedious with the added bonus of making old age, even for the brilliant Sherlock, a hideous business indeed.Add to that two uninteresting and meandering flashbacks, the hook of Holmes's faltering memory not capturing the resolution to a case that haunts him (a glove, a letter) and it all adds up to quite a yawn.The pointless emotional maneuvering of the 3rd act, really destroyed the whole film for me and then Sherlock on his knees in the meadow with stones for this dead ones, no this was not the Sherlock I adored all through those books and films.4 out of 10, quite disappointing but the cinematography and sets were lovely."
" Slow at times; sad and melancholy but worth a watch
",-0.1655,0.9765,2018-01-06 00:00:00,7,"It's not what you might expect from a Sherlock Holmes movie, and sometimes you think the BBC is just milking the brand for every last ounce, but this movie is worth a watch.The Roger character played by Milo Parker is truly outstanding. Fantastic acting. He gets a 10.You can always count on Ian McKellen and Hattie Morahan.Very poignant piece. Some good Life introspection."
" Abandoned Holmes
",-0.4588,0.4133,2017-11-30 00:00:00,6,"Young Sherlock once mused ""I never want to be alone"" when asked what he wanted to be after school. In 1947 Old Sherlock, Mr. Holmes, his memory failing him and life nearing an imminent end laments the fact that his terminal alone-ness has driven too many of the most important people away from him. Set long after His Last Bow, Holmes is living a simple life, tending to his bees in Sussex. Watson is long gone, and so is his happiness.His housekeeper and her son are the only family he has, though the chore of caring for him is beginning to have a negative impact on them. As his memories and recollections vanish like ghosts into the aether, Holmes struggles to reminisce about his final case and the huge failure that led him to isolating himself from the world. Watson gave the story a happy ending, tricking the world into believing that the case was a success, but Holmes has kept the truth secret and very personal.It's not so much a mystery as much as it is a drama about an unhappy man trying to come to terms with his past mistakes. The thing about movies is that they have to be concise and tight when it comes to character development. Soap Operas, sitcoms, and even cartoons don't have this problem as the history and development of a single character can occur over many seasons and years. Sherlock Holmes is probably THE most portrayed character of all time with dozens, maybe hundreds, of actors giving their own unique spin across movies, TV shows, theatre productions, spin-off novels, radio dramas, and even video games. But I have never seen him portrayed so weak, sympathetic, and so far removed from the classic image of the cape, deerstalker, and pipe (""an invention of the illustrator"", he admits). Based on the novel A Slight Trick of the Mind, the movie presents the ""true"" fictional detective, elegantly played by Ian McKellen with Laura Linney doing a truly dodgy West Country accent as his housekeeper. Their relationship is fraught and confrontational, but heartfelt and sincere. The presence of Nicholas Rowe as Holmes in a movie adaptation of his failed last case is what you call a super- meta-meta-meta-fictional moment.Though shot in 2.35:1 (I suspect it is cropped from 1.78:1, a sort of digital version of Super35) it seems quite televisual, so I can't rate it too highly. Bill Condon stages this story like an episode of Midsomer Murders with very little of it feeling theatrical. It's a shame, but the production design makes up for it."
" Even fictional detectives can grow old!
",0.0,0.9018,2017-11-14 00:00:00,10,"The, perhaps most gifted, classical actor of today, Sir Ian McKellen stars in this film about the most famous fictional detective ever created, who tells us himself, towards the end of the canonical stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, that when Sherlock Holmes retired he became a beekeeper. (Several stories occur during and after his retirement.) In addition to McKellen, Laura Linney, with a sometimes shaky British accent, plays Holmes' housekeeper Mrs. Munro and Milo Parker plays her young son Roger, Holmes' young follower and admirer.Mention should be made of Nicholas Rowe who famously played young Sherlock many years ago but, in this film, he is in a brief satiric ""matinee movie"" scene, a nice touch.The similarities to the earlier film ""Gods and Monsters"" (1998) in which the same star, Ian McKellen, played the director James Whale, of the original Frankenstein films, is also not accidental with the story having to do with the final days of that director surrounded by real and fictional characters. It had the same director Bill Condon, as well.Based on the Mitch Cullin novel, A Slight Trick of the Mind, Holmes here is gradually losing his memory and can't recall the facts of his last case and Watson's account of it he finds untrustworthy. But since Watson is described as rarely being around at this time, I can only wonder if Watson would have written that account."
" Slow-paced but a very beautiful story
",0.7776,0.9714,2017-10-28 00:00:00,8,"Mr. Holmes is a beautiful story. I cannot emphasize it enough how beautiful it was.The film starts slowly, and to be honest, when I first started watching the movie I watched only the first 15 minutes. It seemed so dull and too slow, but I was so wrong.The story is built slowly, the characters develop their relationships slowly, the ""case"" inside the story builds up slowly. But when the film was coming to its end I just hoped for more. The slowness was definitely worth the wait, in the end, the movie just shines rays of beauty in form of its characters.I shed a couple tears near the ending as well, I won't spoil the plot details here. I can recommend it, I need to watch this again some day."
" The realism of The Dark Knight franchise comes to the Sherlock Holmes franchise...minus the bat cave & action scenes
",0.0,0.9368,2017-10-26 00:00:00,6,"No SPECIFIC spoilers, I just describe themes in the film, don't know if that is enough to get me banned but you can't ever really tell these days.I stumbled upon this film & decided to watch it 2 days into a miserable detox. I very much desire to have a clear mind once again, and I thought what better inspiration for that than Sherlock Holmes & Sir Ian McKellen that portrays him.Firstly, you can forget about this being similar to any Sherlock Holmes you have seen in the past. The film is a very realistic look at Mr. Holmes during his retired years & the struggles that come with getting old (especially with a mind as great as his). You see him vulnerable & almost helpless, which is a fate that awaits us all. But even more heartbreaking, you know that he has regrets, and no short supply of them. I guess that was put in to show that even a mind as great as his doesn't always make the right choices, and that no matter who we are, when our number is about to be called...I'm sure we'll have no short supply of regret either.I enjoyed the film, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to watch a film on occasion to be moved. If you're looking to just relax with a movie you don't have to think about too much, then maybe put Mr. Holmes on the back burner for the moment, because chances are you will walk away from the film with all these heavy questions in your head."
" Could get the Japanese aspect much better ...
",0.4404,0.6585,2017-10-08 00:00:00,7,"Quite a good story, a little slow at times. The acting is in the most part superb. The story less so. Frustrating that the Japanese scenes resemble China rather than Japan; they are completely different cultures. The prickly ash is not a rare herb but is everywhere in Japan, and in most gardens ... to be ""discovered"" in the ashes of Hiroshima is quite a ludicrous deviation. It is also common in north America. Well, don't let the facts get in the way of a good story ?"
" Not traditional but still enjoyable
",0.5927,0.7003,2017-06-25 00:00:00,9,"Slow-paced, beautifully made. It is more a drama about what is in Mr. Holmes' heart than the mystery itself. I suspect there is some cerebral symbolism to the bees and wasps; perhaps they represent Mr. Holmes' degenerative brain disease. This movie is not dark or Hannibalistic. The mystery is cleverly revealed in out-of-sequence flashbacks. I much prefer this classic story telling to modern, flashy Sherlock productions."
" A great movie.
",0.6249,0.9666,2017-06-01 00:00:00,10,"I was searching for a little bit different. Ian is a great actor. Perfect the part of a 93 year old Sherlock Holmes. Using natural remedies, notes, to keep track of what he needs to know. This is a great lesson in dealing with aging, when you can't quite do what you used to be able to do. He is dealing with several things, multi-tasking, and retreats to his farm. There he takes a young boy under his wing, and is inspired by and mentoring at the same time. Ian and Milo are both exceptional;they aren't acting they are BEING their characters. I deduce that mentoring took place off screen as well as on. The twists, turns, sub plot with the mother, te bees, all makes for a compelling story."
" Good Message/Deep Thoughts
",0.4404,0.7526,2017-02-22 00:00:00,10,"My first attempt at watching this movie never got off the ground, so I sort of wrote it off as not worth it. Later another opportunity came along, so I decided to give it a second chance. I must say that as the movie progressed it drew me in more & more. As the ending neared, the story felt so real & heartwarming...this made me very glad that I had decided to watch it after all."
" A pleasant amble
",0.5106,0.9078,2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"A curious approach to the Holmes mythology - this movie focuses on a retired and aged Holmes living a pastoral existence keeping bees, who tries to recall his last case as dementia strikes him.Played by Ian McKellen, he has a strong on screen presence but is a bit dull. He's aided in his endeavours by Roger, the son of his housekeeper, played expertly by Milo Parker as a brooding budding intellectual.There are some neat sequences, such as Holmes's trip to Japan and the beekeeping education of Roger, but this movie never really gets going. It's a pleasant amble through one of Holmes's cases, easy to watch but without thrills and spills."
