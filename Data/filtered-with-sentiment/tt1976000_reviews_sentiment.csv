" Realistic and entertaining.
",0.4404,-0.5859,2021-04-10 00:00:00,9,"This is one of those hidden gems. You get sucked in quickly and realize you could easily be Rydal (the acquaintance), sucked into what you think is a small problem and now your in deep crap. This has action every few minutes that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is a fast moving film. Great movie."
" A Major DIssapointment
",0.0,0.6395,2021-04-03 00:00:00,5,"First of all, I am a huge fan of psychological thrillers, and those by Patricia HIghsmith in particular. I've read all her books, and am rareley dissapointed. A big fan too of Viggo Mortensen, Kirsten Dunst, and Oscar Isaac. So I was primed for edge-of-seat, Hitchcock-esque suspense and surprises. Clues and tells, and McGuffins.But this film? What happned? It's as flat as can be. No suspense. No sexual tension. Just the beautiful scenery of Athens and Crete and a bit of the Istanbul market which even director Hossein Amini seems to make somewhat bland.The book -- admittedly not Highsmith's best -- let's the reader chew over the pathologies of con artist Chester (Viggo), and ""tour guide"" / Yale graduate and petty grifter Rydal (the cool, but just simmering beneath the surface Issac). But the movie gives us very little to work with as to their motivations, their background, save for Rydal's daddy issues. And what's with the early-in-the-movie hint at some homoerotic thing between Chester and Rydal? We're waiting for 90 minutes and nothing resurfaces.Colette (Dunst) is just an object to be fought over by the two men. She has no agency whatsover. She's just an innocent who wants to get back to America. But what's her real story? Surely she knows what her husband has been up to (think Bernie Maddoff's wife or Kate Blanchette in Blue Jasmine). How does she justfy living off of money swindled from innocent investors? Even in the early 1960s this character would have faced a moral dillemma. Or is she a grifter like the other two?And why, in the movie, do the writers make the first victim a hit-man / thuggish PI, as opposed to the book where he is a simple Greek policeman? It makes the attack seem, well, morally justified. Bad guy vs bad guy. Highsmith was big into moral ambiguity and sociopathy -- Camus style. So why the clean up here?All in all, for me, who was expecting a lot, a big let down. Were I not such a Highsmith fan, and just watching this as Friday night pandemic fare (March 2021), I'd give it a 7 or 8. But sadly, this is no Mr. Ripley."
" truly enjoyable
",0.7003,0.9056,2021-03-23 00:00:00,8,"It has been a while seen I truly enjoyed a movie! The storyline and the plot, the acting and the choice of actors, the music, the wardrobe, even the locations the chose! absolutely beautiful! can't believe I hadn't heard about this movie before"
" Highsmith short shifted
",0.0,0.9298,2021-03-21 00:00:00,7,"Viggo Mortensen is on the run in Greece. Kirsten Dunst is his beautiful wife. Oscar Isaac is a younger American who falls for Dunst. Then Mortensen kills a man who is about to arrest him for defrauding investors. Athens and Istanbul are the locations. The time is 1962. Hossein Amini directed. Alberto Iglesias did the music. Max Minghella was one of ten producers. This film cost $31,000000! There is no comparison to the Talented Mr. Ripley. For more depth backstories in flashbacks could have been included. Marcel Zyskind edited. I found the film should have been lit up. When Anthony Minghella did Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley, he totally improved on the book. It was a masterful film using ideas from Highsmith. When I made that comparison and also The Postman Always Rings Twice, I realized a brilliant movie can be made from a very thin book. They used the books as a springboard to something larger and better. That didn't happen here."
" Watch 'Purple Noon' Instead
",0.0,0.2023,2021-01-24 00:00:00,4,"The usual garrulous mixture of travelogue & murder enmeshing a pair of wealthy vacationers based upon Patricia Highsmith's 1964 novel. There's plenty of local colour and cool threads but no suspense or interest (for which Alberto Inglesias' insistent score tries hard to compensate). Kirsten Dunst as usual shows spunk, but she's onscreen least of the three leads."
" The Two Faces of January
",0.0,-0.6542,2020-08-02 00:00:00,6,"Writer Hossein Amini makes his directorial debut adapting Patricia Highsmith's novel.Set in 1962. Rydal Keener (Oscar Isaac) is an American tour guide in Athens who makes money by skimming visitors. He negotiates prices in Greek and tells the visitors a higher price.Rydal meets a wealthy American couple Chester MacFarland (Viggo Mortensen) and his wife Colette (Kirsten Dunst.) There is something about Chester who reminds Rydal of his recently deceased father.Chester is a financial adviser on the run for swindling his investors. He has been tracked down by a private detective who Chester accidentally kills in a struggle.Chester ropes in Rydal to hide the body by telling him some lies. Rydal chooses to help obtain false passports for the MacFarland's in the hope of making some extra money off them.As they travel to Crete, Colette tells Rydal off her frustrations of living a life on the run. Chester grows jealous from seeing his wife getting close to Rydal.There begins a cat and mouse game between Chester and Rydal, another dead body leaves Rydal in danger of being the fall guy.It has location shooting in Greece and Turkey. There are actors in good form but Amini is too inexperienced as a director. It is a handsome if anodyne movie.Amini is no Hitchcock, there are thrills and intensity missing."
" Thrilling movie
",0.4767,0.4173,2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,Really thrilling movie worth a watch ..don't think a direct remake but very reminiscent of the running man with Laurence Harvey and Lee Remmick .
" Some still make them like they used to
",0.3612,0.7677,2020-07-01 00:00:00,8,"If you complain that they don't make them like they used to, then you will like this classic suspense film set in 1962, an adaptation of a Patricia Highsmith novel. A prosperous looking couple hires a slippery young man to be their tour guide during a visit to Greece. But things start going awry when the older gentleman turns out to be a con artist on the run. The emotional core of the film is the tension - and the connection - between the two men, and the fact that there is an attraction between the younger man and the older man's wife. Good music, acting, camera, and Meditarranean locations."
" good movie!
",0.4926,0.8519,2019-10-11 00:00:00,7,"Nice movie, I liked the atmosphere in which it was shot, Kirsten Dust she was excellent in her role."
" Chick Flick
",0.0,-0.0405,2019-09-17 00:00:00,6,Saw at the end it's based on a novel written by a woman. Not surprising. It's a movie about working through father difficulties in the guise of a thriller. Thus the absence of plot twists. But it makes the r√¥le of the central female character kinda Freudian-creepy.
" Ok
",0.296,0.7738,2019-05-02 00:00:00,6,"An enjoyable movie, but nothing special. The psychological relationship between the two male leads could have been developed more: its true nature (that's interesting indeed) starts revealing at the end, and it's a bit late."
" How to waste 90 minutes of your life
",-0.4215,-0.8873,2019-04-27 00:00:00,1,"This film is crap, simple as that, no real plot, no twist just a complete bore! Describing this film as a thriller is like describing a funeral as exciting! Don't waste your time with it, some proper thrillers to watch are: usual suspects, the prestige, primal fear, seven or prisoners to name a few"
" Stunningly beautiful but dark thriller, the trio of leads is superb
",0.8658,0.9954,2019-04-14 00:00:00,8,"Sophisticated and rich Chester (Viggo Mortensen) and his younger and gorgeous wife, Colette (Kirsten Dunst) are traversing Greece near Athens. We soon find out this is the result of the husband being on the run from folks he fleeced back in the US, without Colette's knowledge. Also near Athens, is a handsome Yankee tour guide, Rydal (Oscar Isaac), who mostly attracts the attentions of wealthy, female tourists, mesmerized by his appearance and smile. In truth, he sometimes shortchanges the women when they need to change dollars into Greek currency. Due to Colette's beauty, Rydal is intrigued by the couple and, along with an heiress with her eyes on the tour guide, the foursome goes out to dinner. Its there that Colette leaves a special gold bracelet behind by chance and Rydal is determined to return it. But, what horror! When the younger man enters the 5th floor of the couple's hotel, Rydal finds Chester dragging a comatose man back into an empty room. According to Chet, the man is drunk and he could use Rydal's help to carry the inebriated gent. The next day, however, the man's death is reported in the papers. Chester then admits that the deceased was an American detective sent to confront the ""thief""; when the P.I. pulled out a gun, Chester shoved him, the man hit his head and passed out. Now, Chester and Colette, who packed in haste and left their passports behind, could really use Rydal's connections in Greece to get new passports and leave the area. Rydal agrees to help but, what are his motivations? As the trio hops a bus and passes on to Crete, can Chester and Colette indeed make a getaway? This intriguing and dark thriller, based on a book by Patricia Highsmith, is so stunningly beautiful it has to be seen, despite some weaknesses. First, the three main actors are very fine indeed. Secondly, the time is the sixties and the costumes are sensational, with Dunst looking so lovely and Mortensen so equally dapper. Then, the scenery in Greece and Crete are brought to beautiful perfection by the cinematographer. What glorious ruins and what an allegory for the lives of three people, brought on by greed? Lastly, the story gains strength subtly and incrementally, until it loses a bit of power near the end but is very fitting. Do you admire stylish thrillers and travel films? This is the best of both worlds!"
" Slow, but worthy of a watch
",0.5927,0.4028,2019-02-22 00:00:00,7,"A slow movie but unusual thriller. Slight reminders of 'The talented mr Ripley'. Whilst the film isn't hugely eventful, the lack of action, gives this film a more realistic, dated feel."
" Modern, old-fashioned tragedy
",-0.6597,0.9298,2019-02-02 00:00:00,7,"This greek/american love triangle mystery was far better than expected. Beautifully filmed and very fine acted. The tone is both warm in color and cold in human trust. The film and especially Viggo Mortensens character reminded me about Volker Schl√∂ndorffs 'Homo Faber' - Mortensen as the new Sam Shepard. The narrative of the film gives you both old-fashioned pace and three-dimensional characters. All in all a fine modern, greek tragedy."
" I LOOKED UP TO MY FATHER AS IF HE WAS A GOD
",0.2732,-0.2627,2018-09-14 00:00:00,8,"The film is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith. Rydal (Oscar Isaac) is an American living abroad working as a tour guide fleecing American tourists. He has father issues. He meets Chester (Viggo Mortensen) MacFarland who reminds him of his father and his wife Colette (Kirsten Dunst) who he desires in an Oedipus kind of way.Chester gets into trouble and must go on the run. Rydal comes along with and get tangled in his life.Janus was a two faced god who looked both forward and backward. The title refers to Rydal, who is a younger form of Chester, two people who are alike but different in age. The story takes on aspects of a Greek Tragedy. The action is slow. The film is more drama than thriller. It is about relationships, that could have been better developed. (I imagine the book did that.)This is not a film for everyone. It is well acted, but the plot moves slow.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity."
" Dull, Bland and not worth your time!
",-0.5659,-0.2523,2018-09-04 00:00:00,2,I could not find any redeeming features in regard to watching this. What could have be a film with an interesting plot nose dives into total insignificance without anything to recommend a viewing.my view-not worth your time and without question one of the poorest films I have had the misfortune to watch
" Disappointin

" The Two Faces of January
",0.0,-0.9924,2017-10-24 00:00:00,5,"I knew the leading actor and actress starring in this movie, to be honest this was good enough reason for me to watch, but also it had been on television a number of times, without me getting the opportunity to see it, so I finally made the effort to watch eventually. Basically set in 1962, charismatic Chester MacFarland (Viggo Mortensen) and his alluring younger wife Colette (Kirsten Dunst) are a glamorous couple from America touring Greece, they visit visit the Acropolis of Athens. While sightseeing they encounter a fellow American, young Greek-speaking Rydal (Oscar Isaac) who is working as a tour guide, scamming tourists on the side, he is impressed with Chester's wealth and sophistication and drawn to Colette's beauty. Rydal accepts the couple's invitation to dinner, but all is not as it seems with the MacFarlands, Chester hides a dark secret, he is con artist, after dinner he is confronted by a private detective, hired by victims of Chester's investment swindles. The detective pulls a gun, in a brief struggle the detective falls and hits his head, Chester finds Rydal in the corridor and demands he help him move the body, he claims the man tried to attack him and assumes he is only unconscious, but the man is dead. In the moment, Rydal agrees to help, but events take a sinister turn and he finds himself compromised and unable to get himself out, he is forced to join Chester and Colette as they go on the run. Rydal continues his infatuation for the vulnerable and responsive Colette, but this only antagonises Chester with increasing jealousy, creating more tensions and paranoia, it becomes a dangerous game of wits between the two men. They are forced to hide in the ruins of Knossos, Chester lures Rydal in and knocks him out, when he emerges, assuming Rydal is dead, Colette tells Chester that this is no way to live, fleeing from one part of the world to another, always afraid that they will be found out by the police, Chester grabs her and tries to force her to come with him, but they struggle, she loses balance, and falls to her death. Rydal comes round the next morning and finds Colette's body, he tracks down Chester, the two men realise they are now bound together by the deaths of the detective and Colette, and the acquisition of false passports, they take a ship back to Athens and go to the airport, Chester pretends to buy tickets to Frankfurt for them both, but leaves Rydal behind, with incriminating evidence. Rydal is arrested, the authorities make a deal with him, forcing him to wear a wire and demand a meeting with Chester in the Grand Bazaar, but Chester suspects his constant questioning and realising he is trying to force a confession out of him. In the end, the police shoot Chester when he attempts to flee, as he lies dying, he speaks into the wire, admitting his responsibility for the deaths of the detective and Colette, exonerating Rydal, Rydal is released, he requests for Chester to buried in Istanbul, he visits his grave and buries Colette's bracelet at the tombstone, and walks away. Also starring Daisy Bevan as Lauren, David Warshofsky as Paul Vittorio and Omiros Poulakis as Nikos. Motensen, Isaac and Dunst all give good performances, it is a simple story of a targeted couple, one being a conman, becoming embroiled with a scam artist in a cat and mouse game with the authorities, it is perhaps a little more style over substance, the costumes, period detail, use of colour and locations look fabulous, but I found myself losing a track a little sometimes, but the plot is full of worthwhile intrigue, and moments of suspense and tension work well, all in all it is reasonable thriller. Worth watching!"
" Strong and unpredictable thriller with Viggo Mortensen
",0.5719,0.936,2017-10-09 00:00:00,8,"If you like the Alfred Hitchcock genre, this is perfect for you. The fairly low rating can be overlooked, because this is a good movie. Although no classic. The story spins around a successful American couple on holiday in Greece. Or are they really on holiday? A third person is involved with the couple, and the story is based on a kill that is committed. The three main characters perform well and manage to convey the tension between as the story goes on. In particular, Viggo Mortensen is good as most of the times. His being and personality make this both unpredictable and nerve-racking. The characters are not what you might think, and this gives the movie an extra dimension. The ending is also surprising. This is not a masterpiece, but certainly good narrative art, and filmed in a well-executed and good way. Recommend it."
" Good acting but slow story
",0.2382,0.7769,2017-08-19 00:00:00,6,"Strange title for this movie. Maybe I just don't get it. But the movie itself is watchable. It's not the greatest even though I can see people really liking The Two Faces Of January. For me it was just a little bit too slow, but that's my opinion. It could have used a bit more conning since the main characters are both con artists. Other than that the story is enjoyable and easy to watch. The main actors are Oscar Isaac, Viggo Mortensen and Kirsten Dunst. The three of them are basically the only important actors of this movie so a bit of variety could have helped. But you can't fault any of them for their acting. That was all very good. Do I regret watching it? No. Will I watch it again in the future? No."
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.9698,2017-08-10 00:00:00,6,"It's set in the 60s and it definitely has that look of movies from that era. It's very-well shot and the locations throughout Greece and Turkey are gorgeous.The performances from the main cast are pretty good too. Ocsar Isaac, Viggo Mortensen and Kirsten Dunst all do a fine job. I've seen them in better films doing stronger work but they carry this story smoothly. It feels like a classic movie that my parents would probably like more than me. The story is not breakneck speed but feels concise at 90 minutes.By the end I found myself enjoying everything but aware I was not going to be engrossed or surprised by it. I probably won't remember much about it a month from now but the director did an above average job for his debut film."
