" Beautiful piece of work.
",0.5994,0.9169,2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,I didn't expect much from this film. Was pleasantly surprised by this beautifully crafted love story.
" Heartfelt
",0.5423,0.9668,2020-09-07 00:00:00,9,"I thought this was pretty good. The story's basic. It's very slice of life. The characters are interesting. Not groundbreaking but you still want to say what they're doing and where they're going as the plot furthers on. I really like their friendship and how it's tested with the arrival of the new kid.If you like Brazilian movies and are currently learning Portuguese, I highly recommend this then."
" A Sensitive Portrayal...

" small details
",0.0,-0.7234,2020-06-04 00:00:00,8,"This kind of movie is often better than living, letting you see the most real and ordinary life of the character, what family opposition, self-identification, homophobia and bullying, and then speaking of racial prejudice, human rights struggle or AIDS, these are many times It's nothing special. Nowadays, the popular trend of gay movies is to show the current status and psychological status of gay characters as ordinary people. The small details of the horses have become more touching and make people find psychological resonance."
" The way he looks review
",0.0,0.9851,2020-04-27 00:00:00,7,"There a short film that was on youtude that this movie is based off of. I watched That short film and was happy. I thought it was good. I imaged what the film could look like. I was a little disappointed when I first watch it. There was a lot of things I liked. I liked the fact one of the main characters were blind, they were both gay and the story was mostly good. The character development was good. The two boys had great chemistry together and their romance was good. The first part that was basically the same as the short film was great. The rest of the story where the film takes off and has nothing to do with the short story becuse the short story didn't touch on that. I thought it was average plot and script and story line. This is a lgbt/ boy loves story. It also touches on a gay blind person which is differnce. Becuse not a lot of LGBT gay films touch on someone who also blind. So I
Like that they did that. I recommend this movie to everyone no matter the age."
" Excellent!
",0.6114,-0.471,2020-04-15 00:00:00,10,"""Not every love happens at first sight"". A sentence that summarizes the movie."
" Real Deep Touching Movie!
",0.0,0.9872,2020-04-04 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best drama gay movies I have seen lately! It brings a simplicity of life That is love and giving and it is romantic, realistic and touching where Leonardo has to deal not only with one challenge that is his blindness but also to bear all the prejudices from his classmates about homosexuality and his willing to be comfortable with his sexuality. Everything was almost perfect , the character of the protagonists including Gi and Gabriel. This Director really made me enjoy the movie and i could not stop watching it and even made me cry at some point! This movie brings all the emotions in a well acting environment with the right Director! Also a beautiful end that makes the movie seal with a good sensation and leaves you with a sight and a good reason to believe in real love!."
" Quality
",0.0,0.9895,2020-02-25 00:00:00,9,"I am straight and therefore can't comment on the authenticity of the coming out / sexual discovery theme of this movie . I can however comment on the authenticity of the HS atmosphere and coming of age . I found it to be incredibly authentic and real. I teach HS currently and this age is so so hard and hormones are everywhere ! Sometimes as adults we find it easy to minimize the issues and emotions teens are feeling . In this movie sometimes you want to just say ""get over it !"" But they do a great job making the emotions feel raw and real to the charactersAlthough the lead was a fantastic actor .. generally better to cast a blind person in a blind role as this creates authenticity and an understanding and representation of a minority group .There was genuine chemistry between all the characters .. loved the relationship between Leo and his parents .. the shaving scene .. the final scene so many powerful moments .Worth the time .. great movie with a feel good vibe and music ."
" An nice little triumph for optimism...
",0.6815,0.9838,2020-01-19 00:00:00,7,"This is a lovely, gentle film about a blind lad (Ghilherme Lobo). At school he meets new student (Fabio Audi) who helps him on his quest for independence from his loving, but overbearingly controlling parents; from his best girlfriend ""Giovana"" (Tess Amorim) and from the practical limitations of his visual impairment. Slowly, they fall for each other and this becomes a story about identity and confidence. The plot isn't going to surprise you; but the performances are strong and convincing and the dialogue flows well too. There's a good bit of Belle & Sebastian music thrown in, too."
" Beautiful Crafted!
",0.636,0.9517,2020-01-14 00:00:00,10,"A short, crisp, sweet and a tender teenage love story that will surely bring a little warmth in your heart. An absolute must watch, you'll love it."
" Charming, Calming and Loving
",0.886,0.9643,2019-12-18 00:00:00,10,"One of the sweetest romance depicted in such a apt manner. Slightest scenes, add beauty to the story. Both the actors are superb, direction is amazing. My favourite Romantic film. Highly recommended."
" A Hidden Gem
",0.0,0.9059,2019-12-18 00:00:00,10,"This is one of those movies that are very easy to overlook. It does not have any known actors, it does not have any unknown actors that are incredibly good looking, and the plot at first glance seems simplistic and unoriginal. I wish the movie had become a bigger hit, maybe even a mainstream title, because more people deserve to enjoy this hidden gem"
" Great and Sweet Movie
",0.7964,0.965,2019-10-26 00:00:00,8,"I have seen this movie twice now, and it was just as good the second time. The romance is less flashy than other movies and only is really blatantly shown for a short portion of the film, but instead there is a slow tension/feeling that builds throughout the film and eventually reaches a climax. I sometimes wish movies in general--including this one--were a little more realistic compared to real life, but that probably wouldn't be as enjoyable to watch I guess. Either way, great movie that I would watch again, and I was again left wanting to see more from the characters. 10/26/19 Also, I loved the fact that it was in Portuguese because I have very little exposure to the language, and I would like to see more of it."
" delightful
",0.5859,0.9916,2019-07-25 00:00:00,7,The way he looks might be the best foreign LGBT movie ever and trust me I have seen many. watching these two boys fall in love is just so cute and endearing. the acting is fantastic and the story both captivating and romantic. there are so many scenes in the movie that just make me smile from ear to ear and the movie just makes you feel good. this movie is simply delightful and if you love LGBT movies go watch this one right away I promise you will love it.
" Lovely Coming of Age Story
",0.5859,0.9909,2019-04-26 00:00:00,8,"This is a really delightful coming of age film with a slight twist. Our young hero, Leo has been blind since birth, but like all teenagers, he longs for that someone special. Enter new classmate, Gabriel, and their easy friendship slowly but surely changes into something more. The way this story is told is gentle and kind. You can't help but love them and best female friend, Giovanna too. The actors felt so genuine and gave wonderful performances. Thumbs up for this one."
" A love story for the ages
",0.6369,0.9681,2018-09-02 00:00:00,10,"When I was in high school there was a blind boy who lived a pretty full life From what I could see. He drove race cars, rode a motorcycle, and went to all the dances. I loved the very human way Leo's story was told because it reminded me of that boy. In high school I longed for a kiss from a boy I liked. I wish I had the courage to share my feelings with someone. I'm so glad in this story, the young people get to be who they are."
" Funny, Fresh, Classic, Lovely
",0.8402,0.9506,2018-08-27 00:00:00,10,"That's the movie you should be watching if you're looking for an innocent gay love story.
-Acting is great
-Words are chosen wisely
-Characters actors are cute
-It's not boring
-Some parts might be a little confusing due to sequence cut-outs."
" Why this film resonates with us
",0.0,0.9883,2017-10-14 00:00:00,9,"Almost all of us gay guys love this movie. It's sweet without treacle, and sensitive without being patronizing.I think it resonates with us mostly because Leo--blind AND gay--represents the isolation many of us felt when we began hoping for a love connection. When you're young and gay and haven't yet worked up the courage to tell anyone, the isolation can be overwhelming. You don't know who is or isn't like you, you can only speculate. And you can only speculate in an oblique, round-about way lest you inadvertently reveal too much about yourself. Keen observation seems an essential skill.In this movie, poor Leo is already isolated because of his disability. And even though he has learned to navigate the physical world with confidence, the world of emotional connections is another thing altogether.So much of the way we figure things out is visually. Surreptitious glances or prolonged eye contact become clues to help us find our way. So our hearts ache for Leo who has to figure all this out from conversations or third-hand information. He even has to ask his best friend how she rates his appearance; he has no other way to find out if he's considered attractive. Can you imagine not checking your appearance in the mirror before you leave the house? Checking and re-checking? This is why we love this movie. Coming out is hard enough for we the sighted, and little Leo manages it in a world of total darkness. In so doing he wins our respect AND our love."
" Incredible cinema in a short OR feature
",0.0,0.9108,2017-08-02 00:00:00,9,"There are many conceptual films where upon viewing, one gets the sense that a) the same message could have been encapsulated in a short film or b) much more needed to be said and the characters further developed in a feature length. The Way He Looks (English title) is one of those unique endeavors where you could watch either this feature film, and/or it's short-film version ""Hoje nao quero voltar sozinho"" and be equally mesmerized and enchanted with the acting, direction, dialogue and overall theme. While the actors (thankfully, all the same) are much younger in the short film (shot 4 years prior), the message and intensity is still very much the evident, albeit on a much lighter and more whimsical scale. The feature length is definitely a lot heavier, in that it deals with some harsh subjects, namely teen angst and the potential for cruelty among adolescent youths, especially ones who prey upon the handicapped. Because of this, what the feature length ""lacks"" in innocence, it makes up for in ""triumph"". I'm giving this 9 stars because there is a bit of gratuitous nudity in the feature length film, which personally put me off since in my mind I was still thinking of these actors as ""kids"" from the short film and found it a bit exploitative. But truly, this is a masterpiece for all involved."
" Subtle and beautifully edited movie
",0.5719,0.9927,2017-06-04 00:00:00,10,"I'm not going to summarize the plot, since I assume those who have gotten to this page have already read the synopsis. What I came here to do, is to compliment the way this story is told. Small details that make all the difference, such as how Leonardo traces two of his fingers along the walls of his home to navigate, are ubiquitous in ""Hoje Eu Quero Voltar Sozinho"" and make the film feel very authentic. Furthermore, I really enjoyed the cinematography – and especially when it came to the muted colors and the framing and how the director didn't shy away from long takes. I also liked the editing. I don't really know what it's called, but they cut the film in a way that portrayed meaning. For example, Gabriel was talking about going to see a movie with Leonardo. After realizing Gabriel wouldn't be able to see the movie due to his blindness, he apologized and stated that he wouldn't make the same mistake again. After a couple of seconds, they cut to the movie theater where Gabriel is explaining what is happening to Leonardo. Had the movie been made by someone else, they might have made Gabriel and Leonardo have a discussion about actually going to see the movie and then follow them as they leave. To instead cut directly from Gabriel scolding himself, making the viewer assume they aren't going, to the boys sitting in the movie theater, makes a pleasant surprise and even though we don't know what happened in between the scenes we are still left with a feeling of what it might have looked like. There are several instances of this kind of editing in the movie, and it actually helps with the flow of the story and I'm kind of reminded of the famous lyric: ""You say it best when you say nothing at all"".Lastly, I'd just like to say how much I loved how tactile Leonardo and Gabriella were. How they sat outside the school, Gabriella touching his hair while Leonardo rested his head in her lap. How they would sit in his bed. It was very refreshing to see a guy and a girl being such good friends, and very touchy-feely, without it ever going in a sexual or romantic direction. Also, that final scene had me smiling from EAR TO EAR!"
" A Coming Of Age movie which isn't like the rest
",-0.2755,0.9944,2017-06-03 00:00:00,8,"The film centers around Leonardo, a blind teenager, and if that wasn't hard enough on him, he's also struggling with his sexuality and his relationship with his parents. When the new boy Gabriel befriends him, it tests his relationship with best friend Giovana and opens him up to new opportunities.I absolutely love this movie! For once we get a coming of age movie that isn't about a straight, moody white boy with too many hormones, and get something that feels so much more real. The acting is great, and so are the characters and the relationships between them. Giovana and Leo have such a great friendship, although Giovana is in the friend zone. Leo doesn't think he should be limited because of his disability, causing him to be both rebellious and sassy which I love. Gabriel probably had the least impression on me, he was nice enough but kinda bland I thought. Although obviously I still shipped him and Leo, and the film keeps their fate in the balance until basically the last ten minutes which was nerve wracking to say the least.This was one of those great films that can have you laughing and crying at the same time. I would also like to thank the film for introducing to me Belle And Sebastian who I'm now obsessed with. I also quite like the fact that they didn't overdramatise the theme of homosexuality, Leo seemed comfortable in his sexuality despite being closeted and that was really nice to see instead of the usual inner turmoil gay characters have which can get tiresome after a while, if you watch lots of things with LGBT characters in which I do. Overall, a lovely little film with nice characters that you should definitely watch to unwind and relax."
" Subtle and tactile romance
",0.5574,0.9839,2017-03-19 00:00:00,7,"Leo and his best friend Giovana's life changes drastically as a new boy, Gabriel, joins their school. Leo and Gio's friendship is being tested as the two boys fall into love with each other. Throughout all of this, Leo struggles to find acceptance and independence in his life despite his overprotective parents who are all-too-worried about him being blind.THE WAY HE LOOKS is a subtle romance story between two school boys. It deals with the topic of homosexuality without becoming a trite coming-out flick. The characters seem real and believable. The romance is subtle, not tacky and clichéd like in so many other gay love stories. And Leo's blindness makes everything feel all the more tactile and physical. Kudos to actor Ghilherme Lobo for giving a very believable impression of a blind person.The editing and cinematography is on point. There's not much music here, but the music that is there is well placed. The most striking thing about THE WAY HE LOOKS is the strong cast that makes this feel-good romance stand out."
" It is very sweet
",0.5095,0.8688,2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"This is a very sweet film. I certainly enjoyed it. I found myself googling to see if Ghilherme Lobo, who plays Leo, is actually blind himself. I don't think he is but he was very convincing.As well as the drama between the two main characters in the film, Leo and Gabriel (Fabio Audi) there is also powerful drama in the relations that Leo has with his parents and of course the problems faced by his being blind but having to make his way in the sighted world.The portrayal of the lower middle-class society that the drama is set in is also really first class.The film is nicely directed, scripted etc. I think just about anyone will enjoy this film."
" Could have been a TV series!
",0.0,0.9682,2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"Charming little film. The plot is significantly different from the short film it's based on that, aside from the direction of the ending, you'll not feel like you're repeating yourself by watching it. The short is definitely worth the watch as well, though, because the ending is... more cute? My only critique with the film is how many plot-points begin but don't resolve or even explore all that much during the feature-length time limits. Being in love with the TV series, Please Like Me, I couldn't help but imagine The Way He Looks as a similarly formatted TV series. The film was segregated quite neatly into micro-plots and settings that may have functioned better in an episodic format, as well as getting the potential for a season two (whereas I'm not certain a sequel film would be as good)."
