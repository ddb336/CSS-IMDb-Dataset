" United Arab Emirates ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 9 /10
",0.4215,0.8548,2021-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Set in the unforgiving and vast desert wilderness of Ottoman-controlled Arabia this survival-drama comes across as a Wild West tale of the Middle East, with shades of John Ford and a certain David Lean epic. An engrossing story about the youngest son of a Bedouin Sheikh being caught up in the conflicts of World War I and learning some harsh lessons in nomadic brotherhood, loyalties and customs. Considering this is the director's first film its a well-crafted debut feature with some stunning scenery and convincing performances from all involved, especially the young lead and a haunting and nuanced score. Also, being told from the perspective of the locals and not some world-wandering foreign hero had the refreshing effect of making the film feel very authentic to the time and place it is set in, would love to find some more films like this."
" Good production need a better story
",0.7003,0.2861,2020-12-11 00:00:00,7,"As an Arab born and raised in the same spot I found it reflecting the true image almost the same culture and language and conversations at that point of time. Even Badwen words and culture was presented fine.
Unlike other movies presenting clowns pretending to be Arabs. However the story wasn't great and it could be better also the conversations and actors were very weak and not big and loud as it should be.I am raising the hat for the director and I know he can do better than that in the future but should work more on the story and the conversations."

" This movie is spectacular!
",0.0,0.3506,2019-01-18 00:00:00,10,We loved watching a traditional story that remained as it is without changing it in the movie but brought it to life.
" Moving and atmospheric
",0.0,0.9731,2018-11-07 00:00:00,8,"I caught this film by accident on late night television. In the past, I've not been very impressed by most films coming out of the Middle Eastern countries but Theeb rapidly won me over. The acting was excellent & felt authentic and the cinematography makes good use of the dramatic natural locations. At times it feels a bit like Lawrence of Arabia told from the Bedouin or child's POV.It moves a bit more slowly than most Hollywood films do, but it is better for it. I could write a lot more on this film but won't for the sake of brevity."
" Gripping tale
",0.0,0.9061,2018-09-07 00:00:00,10,"Theeb offers a great environment to the film: the unforgiving Arabian desert and the herders who live among it. Theeb is a young boy who travels with his older brother to guide an Englishman and his companion to a well. Of course, with the advent of the railway, the trails have become filled with looters and dangerous people in general.Everything in the film feels authentic: the way they interact, the situations, the dialogue. It looks great. Also, the suspense keeps you on edge throughout as you really don't know what to expect and there are many surprises. A very good film indeed."
" A True Wolf
",0.4215,0.9136,2017-06-14 00:00:00,9,"Theeb is a gradually built film of characterization and nuance, using tension, action, and imagery more than dialogue. Similar to The Revenant (2015) in its use of extensive visuals as an important tool of development, this film is even more effective. Both pieces detail a story of survival; however, Theeb, the main character of the film, truly breaks a mental barrier in his character development (where Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, falls short) through outstanding directing, writing, acting, and filming.This movie matches the desert's pace. Slow and steady. Nowar provides the foundation for the main conflict over the entire first hour. Mainly without dialogue, brotherly relationship is detailed, WWI tensions are subtly described, and Theeb is slowly characterized. Tension is masterfully built from the limited perspective of the child, thus truly isolating the events of the plot as a mere device to effectively challenge and build Theeb. Written and directed beautifully, the film reaches the height of The Godfather (1972) in its great character sketch.Theeb is simply a piece of art. Thaler utilizes an experience as rich as Emmanuel Lubezki's to film the events of the film. Each lingering shot serves a purpose to derive a certain emotion; each close-up of Theeb emits an aura to further characterize; each shot of nature emphasizes the environment and danger at the perfect time. Each element of the piece added together build towards a climax so carefully constructed and so gradually built that the slightest touch of the feather would knock it over. This is a film where the emotions of the actors can be felt through the camera; through the screen.Additionally, the movie achieves a fantastic degree of realism. The environment is real, the characters are real, the dialogue is real, and the events are real. The cautiously written script along with the authentic acting creates a reality, in which the full effect of the film can be realized. The acting is nothing special, which makes it real.The immensity of Theeb and his character is alluded to throughout the film and realized because of the events. Theeb is a wolf, born in danger and forged through trial of fire. But emotion was lost somewhere in the middle section of the film. The foundation of the pyramid that Nowar so carefully built eroded away ever so slightly, but just enough to reduce the impact of the final brick being placed. Thus, we find Theeb, the wolf, toughened and tempered, but with no emotion, making this a film about a true wolf."
" Power of Family
",0.0,0.915,2017-06-04 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)During WWI, a British officer requests the help of locals to show him the way through the dessert mountains to a secret water well. This is the foundation story on which the main story grows upon. And that is of a little boy who tags along with his older brother, another local and the British officer. Along the journey he grows and matures amongst several tense situations. With sparse dialog, much of the story is told visually with the help of amazing scenery and believable acting. The viewer is fully engaged as you had no idea what'll happen next as the story unfolds as the journey goes. Very nice piece of cinema especially from an unexpected country."
" A young boy facing the adult world is an adventure story involving death and honor
",0.1531,0.973,2017-05-07 00:00:00,8,"A surprising very good movie made with love of cinema, something that doesn't happen enough in north Africa where, apart from very rare examples, the doing had stayed somewhat amateurish, storytelling wise. Great characters, simple story (in a good sense, difficult to manage), great sets. Well done."
" a boy can see a lot of violence, even if he doesn't see the war
",-0.2392,0.012,2017-01-17 00:00:00,10,"Everything that's happened in the Middle East in the past twenty years makes Naji Abu Nowar's ""Theeb"" (Arabic for wolf, pronounced ðiːb) all the more important. On the one hand, ""Theeb"" - Jordan's first movie to receive an Academy Award nomination - is one of the many movies about world events as seen through the eyes of a child. But these are events with which most people in the west are probably not familiar.The setting is Hejaz, right after the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. The title character is a recently orphaned Bedouin boy. His brother gets given the assignment of leading a British officer to a Roman well near the Ottoman railway. Theeb follows and witnesses things that will impact him for the rest of his life.The casting of nonprofessional actors gives the movie additional realism. These could be literally any ordinary people in the Arab world, not realizing that their alliance with the British and French would result not only in further colonialism, but a partitioning of the region that would eventually lead to the current bloodshed. Over the course of the movie, Theeb gets forced to mature, and at the end, he does something that no one would expect a child to do (but he has no other choice, does he?). This world of marauding tribes and treacherous dealings is a dangerous one to inhabit, but is the one that will influence Theeb.Outstanding movie. I recommend it."
