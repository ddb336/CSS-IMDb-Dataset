" A well taken family crime picture
",-0.34,0.2263,2020-06-10 00:00:00,10,Watched this film multiple times. A good family crime picture in Godfather style. Exceptional acting by ilaya thalapathi Vijay sir and Mohanlal sir. An emotional roller coaster for two and a half hours. Worth watching.

" Decent Entertainer
",0.3818,0.9871,2018-03-24 00:00:00,6,"The movie is about the relationship between Don - Sivan(MohanLal) and his foster son - Shakthi (Vijay). Shakthi hates policeman and Khaki(police uniform) but Sivan decides to get him into police force in order to carry out his illegal activities without any problem. Things take turn when after an unfortunate incident Shakthi turns into an honest and sincere policeman confronting his father Sivan and his illlegal activities. Rest of the story tells us whether the rift between father-son was genuine or was it a conspiracy by their enemies , or did they plan it themselves , Do they re unite , Does Sivan gives up his illegal business or not ?Its a masala entertainer with dosage of comedy , action , family bonding which entertains effectively but there is a big weak point in my opinion - the transition of Shakthi . The event that led to his transformation should have been nothing new to shakthi, with him being a right hand to underworld don. Yes , we are not supposed to think a lot in masala entertainers but this thing was very blatant and hard to fathom. If the reason which initiates the confrontation and leads you to the main story is weak it somehow stays with you and questions you. Mohanlal is excellent as ruthless dominating don who doesn't want his rule to slip away and as a doting father and family man. Vijay is good in comedy and action scenes but at places fumble during emotional scenes. Kajal Aggarwal looks good but she doesn't have much to do apart from providing romantic and comedy relief . Remaining characters doesn't have much to do but were good in whatever part they had to play ..All in All its decent masala entertainer and you wont be disappointed if you are looking for some entertainment Tamil cinema style :)"
