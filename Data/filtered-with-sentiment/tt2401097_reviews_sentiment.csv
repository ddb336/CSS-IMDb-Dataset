" Wow
",0.5859,-0.6845,2021-03-24 00:00:00,7,"I was very shocked how good this movie was, Taylor has improved a hell of a lot since Abduction when he was terrible. Very Good"
" One of the Best Parkour Movies with Unnecessary Violence
",0.0258,-0.9798,2021-03-20 00:00:00,8,This is indeed one of the best parkour movies with some unnecessary violence added to it for the main stream audience.I watched it for the parkour and was happy to see some very well choreographed chases and runs along with a good introduction into the intricacies of parkour or how to learn it.The overall story also makes sense and Taylor Lautner embodies the main character convincingly. The love story does not work that well - there is no real passion visible but that can be explained by the plot.As with most other parkour movies some crime and violence elements have been added to suit the blood thirsty main stream audience. I loathed those depictions of unnecessary violence. The criminal activities created some thrill and were a good excuse for more jumping and running.Average people consider parkour to be dangerous and a crime so sadly the movies fits that stereotype.
" Great choreographed Free-Running
",0.6249,0.9893,2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"""Tracers"" is an action-movie, mostly impressing with its free-running-sequences that are far more than well done. They're really cool and entertain more than some other action-movie that just depicts exploding things over and over again.Cam (Taylor Lautner!), a bike courier, gets randomly in contact with a free-running girl he falls in love with. On their first meeting, they bump into each other, causing Cams bike to broke. Nikki (Marie Avgeropoulos), the girl, buys him a new bike. So the adventure begins: Cam searches for Nikki and tries to thank her and from now on tries to impress her and starts to train parkour himself. Later, he gets picked up by gangster Miller, who leads a troup of freerunners, that do courier jobs and heists.While the plot is very underwhelming and dumb, I am ready to oversee it and just look on these epic choreographes, not only free-running, bike racing too! It's like a YouTube-Video from 2012, in which a guy is making cool jumps and parkour through a city, but as a movie, which sounds a bit dumb. Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is pretty dumb and plotwise exchangable, but really independent in case of parkour. There's no other movie which offers this much impressive free running scenes. The opening scene from ""Casino Royale"" was really great too, but ""Tracers"" puts the cherry on top.So: Silly action-thriller with really (again) impressive free-running stuff and bike racing sequences, but many issues in case of plot and sense. But in my opinion, a good action film does't have to be logical or well written to entertain, so don't take this film too seriously."
" Bad script, action scenes are good (4.5)
",-0.1531,0.9367,2020-03-17 00:00:00,4,"It sounds like an enjoyable but not a nice movie, more like an amateur movie,camera shots are generally nice,
The cast is not bad either, taylor is very suitable for the role. The head of the movie was more remarkable and enjoyable as it progressed, it made me a little bored, I was expecting it to go on the bike but they turned to the parkour.
very absurd events happened towards the end and got strange on the scenes the film's potential would not have been more, but they could have finished better."
" Close, but no cigar
",-0.4215,-0.147,2019-07-06 00:00:00,5,"It's always a little frustrating when you see a movie that had some good resources and some good effort put into it here and there, but in the end not enough was done to make the movie a real grabber. That is what unfortunately happened with the making of ""Tracers"". On the surface, the movie seems to have something going for it. While not a big budget enterprise, the movie all the same looks fairly slick and without any shabbiness. And while the parkour action does eventually start to look alike, some of it is pretty well done by the director and the participants (the latter many times being done by the actors themselves and not stunt professionals.) However, the first hour of the movie often really drags by. The main character's predicament seems to be that of being mildly inconvenienced. As a result of that (plus a really slowly moving story concerning his dealings with the other characters), there isn't enough dramatic tension or reason to get really involved with the characters and what they do. In the last 30 or so minutes of the movie, things do start to move in a more dramatic and tense manner, but it ends up being a bit too little, too late. Also, the movie ends on a note where it seems that the remaining main characters are refusing to come fully with terms as to what has just happened to them and the people they know. The whole package isn't awful to watch, but it's too flat and too uninvolving to make it worth going out of your way for."
" Point Break 26 years later
",0.0,0.2558,2019-05-20 00:00:00,6,"Not bad. Parcouring is trendy. The action shots re well done. Actors with limited scope but hey, it s a 98 minutes action movie..."
" I was entertained
",0.4019,0.8016,2019-03-01 00:00:00,7,Had never heard of this movie until the other night when I was looking for something new to watch. I was entertained enough to stay up late to finish it and have watched the parkour parts of the movie a few times more. I love the music.
" THE BIKE IS A BALL AND CHAIN
",0.0,0.2846,2018-11-19 00:00:00,4,"Cam (Taylor Lautner) is a NYC bike messenger. He owes the Chinese mafia money and his bicycle just got wreaked by Nikki (Marie Avgeropoulos) an aloof parkopur (free running urban acrobats) beauty. Cam, who is athletic, trains himself and joins the group lead by Miller (Adam Rayner). The group does more than run as they rob bad guys which creates issues.Everyone in the group seems to have a lame secret they hide. The plot is thin as the film is consumed with kids running and jumping. If you are into parkour, this film should have appeal to you, but for an old couch potato, there really isn't much to see.Guide: Love scene. No F-bombs or nudity."
" The trailer is as good as it gets
",0.4404,-0.4592,2018-08-20 00:00:00,3,"Initially this seemed like an exciting concept, parkour infused robberies. But after probably 20 minutes into it I got bored, it felt like a never ending YouTube parkour tutorial. And it was just downhill from there. It seems Americans cant make movies without adding a random love plot with the inevitable sex scene. Overall I strongly disliked the movie but that could also be attributed to my repulsion to Taylor Lautner's acting and looks, the guy's face is nauseating. I thought I had recovered from the Twilight torment but I think it's still to soon."
" Premium Rush rip-off
",0.0,-0.1531,2018-05-16 00:00:00,4,"TRACERS is another boring, kid-friendly thriller set on the bustling streets of New York. It feels like the guys who made it watched PREMIUM RUSH and decided to make their own version of that film, replacing the bike action with parkour. I love parkour, enjoy seeing it done to perfection in the likes of DISTRICT 13 and CASINO ROYALE, but it's very ordinary here. The stunts are good but the shaking camerawork in between the stunts spoils it a little. The film also suffers from the casting of the incredibly wooden and one-dimensional Taylor Lautner as the supposedly charismatic lead, as he has no depth here whatsoever. The plot involves him with the least-imposing gangster villains ever, and an interminable narrative structure that mixes in romantic dialogue and weak heist scenes. It only gets going in the final action scene, and by then it's thankfully nearly over."
" The main character continuously gets into one bad situation after another.
",-0.5423,0.2702,2017-06-02 00:00:00,5,"Okay so Tracers has a nice film score, the performances are natural, the plot is half-original, we've all watched hundreds of films where a character borrows money from hardcore people and can't pay them back and goes into crime themselves to earn quick money to pay them back, but what makes Tracers HALF-original is the jumping around stuff that they do - that sort of thing is rare in movies.The pacing of the movie is okay for about half an hour, then it just drags on, of course there was the tired love interest scenario which is extremely clich√© and boring, the girl looks like she is 10 years old and even though Taylor Lautner looks young, he still looks too old for her, that romance scenario was just plain awkward.The only time Tracers became riveting was about an hour into the movie and then shortly after that chase and shoot out scene the pacing started to dry up again, they should have spent more time in the editing room and cut some scenes or make new scenes.There is a couple of predictable scenarios, but the twist about their ""leader"" was unexpected.Tracers is only about an hour and thirty three minutes long, if it'd been longer it would have gotten really boring real quick.This is the type of film that you only need to ever watch once or not at all.The main character has choices and he constantly makes the wrong ones, and as he explains his mother still lost her house so all of that borrowing money from the wrong people was pointless and resulting in him looking over his shoulder and putting people who he saw as family (his landlord and her kid) in danger.I recommend the other Taylor Lautner movie ""Abducted"" which has a much better plot."
" A lot of jumping around
",0.0,-0.0621,2017-02-17 00:00:00,6,"I would probably have liked this movie more when I was much younger because then I was still fit and sportive and I would associate myself more with the parkour scenes. Even though parkour didn't exist when I was young and that's too bad, because it seems like a fun thing to do, I can get that young people like to do this. You got to have skills and got to be fit and also like the adrenaline rush you get when doing dangerous things. Not that parkour is always dangerous but some scenes in the movie could mean instant death or at least serious injuries if you miscalculate a jump or roll. So to me the action scenes were pleasant to watch. There's a lot of jumping, hopping, falling and rolling but it's enjoyable to watch. The story though is a bit dull. The actors aren't that great either, they're just okay. In conclusion, if I would still be young I probably would start doing parkour after watching this movie, but I'm not so it's just okay to watch once."
