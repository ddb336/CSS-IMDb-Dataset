" Totally misses the mark... It's not sugar per-se, it's about processed and animal based foods.
",-0.2944,-0.1027,2020-04-20 00:00:00,1,"Cheese has no sugar, we can just binge on cheese all day long and we'll be just fine right? Eggs have no sugar, lard has no sugar, sausages have no sugar, I can go on and on... Next time you try to make a plausible documentary offer some practical advice and show some results, this was disgraceful.
In conclusion, it's not about sugar, it's about processed and animal based foods. For reference go watch one of the following: Forks Over Knives, What the Health, Food Choices, Eating you Alive, Game Changers.
You're welcome."
" Something to chew on
",0.0,-0.4821,2019-08-07 00:00:00,10,"Fed Up is a documentary that has broken through much of the barriers that hold health documentaries back, and been unique in its success. I first found this film on Netflix, which immediately made me think that it was likely much better produced than the grainy, cheesy, dull clips that were shown in schools. I started the film not entirely sure of what to expect, but as a fan of Morgan Spurlock's film ""Supersize Me"", found much overlap content-wise in the dangers of overconsumption of processed foods. However, Fed Up is in a category of its own in that it doesn't just show the dangers of processed foods and sugars...it holds someone accountable for it. This film dares to go against legal and social precedent, and accuses both the United States government and big-name food companies of being accomplices in the American health crisis. To say the least: I was impressed. This is a family film that you can (and should!) show to your kids, your grandkids, your friends, and the neighbor down the street. People need to know, and this film dares to tell."
" Crazy propaganda.

",0.0,0.9728,2019-06-17 00:00:00,7,"This U.S. documentary centres around the obesity epidemic among young Americans in the U.S. during the past thirty years. The exposé includes knowledge on the true way nutrition works and how the U.S. sugar, cola, and junk food industries have manipulated governments to keep their profits high at the expense of so many people.Considering the conspiracies exposed in this film, it must have taken a lot of courage for the film-makers and interviewees to participate in this daring project.There are scientific facts about how nutrition works and whether exercise can actually burn calories from certain foods. Some of these facts are presented with cartoon-like graphics. This helps maintain attention as scientific facts are occasionally hard to follow.The movie's deeper truths are exposed with the lies about nutrition (claiming that calories from a cola have the same consequences as those from almonds) and the devious ways that large corporations have hijacked many well-intended government health initiatives including those outside the U.S. borders such as the World Health Organization and those within U.S. borders such as Michelle Obama's ""Let's Move"" campaign to fight child obesity.It's easy to feel down by the end of this film although there is a bit of optimism in the reference to the battles won against the tobacco industries. In any case, the graphics, interviews, old footage and the downright courage of everyone involved in ""Fed Up"" made the film well worth viewing."
" Sugar Bad - Democrat Good - Morbidly Obese Children Make Us Feel Sad (A Propaganda by Katie Couric)
",-0.6908,0.8448,2019-05-28 00:00:00,2,"A propaganda film asserting the evils of sugar and attempting to set the stage for government intervention that would further attempt to regulate human behavior. The experts and interviews are mostly the punch line of a joke Katie doesn't even know she is telling. The people of the US are being made more sick and more tired through the constant efforts of mediocre progressive intellect and the absence of wisdom that runs with it.
-It is certain that if you drown your biochemistry in *sugar it will have horrible effects on your health and limit your life span.
Lets play a game: In the sentence above, replace the word *sugar with any of the following and lets see if the claim still holds true...
1-alcohol
2-potatoes
3-bread
4-Big Mac
5-Water (Water Intoxication)
You get the idea that nearly anything in excess can be very harmful and even fatal. A special thanks to career propagandist Katie Couric for sharing the progressive ideal of valuing ideas over people while representing that you really are a deep and caring person.
While the political left totally controls the education system in the US, how about developing a revealing and substantive documentary on the grand failings of the democrat-controlled education system to deliver on three foundational obligations:
1) Teach children how to properly feed their bodies
2) Teach children how to effectively manage their money and their finances
3) Teach children how to use reason to achieve an intellectual victory in any argument
This should be cemented into a child's behavior by the end of the eighth grade."
" Great documentary about America's disfunctional relationship with food
",0.6249,0.4201,2019-05-27 00:00:00,10,Highly recommend for accurate and quantifiable evidence about the food and advertising industry in America.
" Knowledge will set you free and extend your life
",0.6124,0.8289,2019-05-26 00:00:00,8,"I hope films like this continue to be made and hope that we take action. At 55 I've seen a dramatic change in America's waist line. I've personal lived through it too going from skinny to obese and thankfully back to a healthy waist by eating real, full fat, foods. I do believe that food is 90% of the weight game but also believe that some exercise is critical for overall all health. It is very easy today to sit in front of a TV or video game monitor all day."
" Sugar Is The Enemy
",-0.5423,0.9636,2019-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Fed Up is a documentary that is based off of people who are obese and have a problem with consuming too much sugar and foods. This documentary shows how kids in their early teen years are obese and why. Also what they do to try and become healthy again. This also makes us realize that we need to take care of ourselves and watch what we are eating and doing in order to maintain and healthy and good lifestyle.
There were 3 main kids in this documentary and they were all under the age of 15. The oldest one was 14 and he was over 400 pounds. He had to get gastric bypass surgery. One of the four kids was a girl and she touched me the most because since I am a girl I felt like I could relate to her in a emotional and self confidence type of way. In some of her videos where she was talking she would cry because it's hard for her to lose weight it's not because they don't want to lose it it's just because they have a big appetite and they love to eat. Also once they lose weight they always some how gain it back. I could relate to her in a way when they were talking about how girls worry a lot about their body and what they look like because I think about that a lot. I always tend to think that if you have a skinny body and you are slim then everyone will like you. And I feel like people won't like you if you are not slim and good looking. Especially for the kids in their early teen ages will get teased and picked on. That will hurt their self-esteem and make them not have confidence in themselves.
In this documentary they had also talked about the food industry and how they get us to purchase and consume their products. What stood out to me was how a lot of products had made a reduced-fat version of their products but the thing that had shocked me was the amount of sugar in both the original product and the reduced-fat one. They both have the same amount of sugar just the amount of calories is lowered by ten in the reduced-fat one. So basically you are intaking the same amount of sugar and just taking in ten less calories.
Do you actually watch the commercials that appear in between your show?Commercials is another big cause for why we consume a lot of sugary products. This is a problem because in the documentary they talk about how one main thing that influences us to buy all these unhealthy products are celebrities who star in commercials. They are a big influence because most people like to listen to music and follow celebrities. For example if Beyoncé is drinking a Pepsi and tells you to drink it then you would go and drink it because you like Beyoncé and just because she is drinking a Pepsi you feel like you now have to go and drink one as well. Most commercials you will see a celebrity that you know acting or staring in it and they are most likely advertising something, most likely a drink or some sort of food, restaurant or place to go.
I would highly recommend this documentary to kids either becoming a teen, in their teens, and or adults. They should watch this documentary because it really opens up your eyes and kinda shocks you a bit. It makes you consider re-thinking about your life and what you are putting in your body. This documentary could make you realize that you might need to change the way your are living and what you are consuming so you can stay healthy and live a good life."
" Ridiculous
",-0.3612,-0.8588,2018-03-26 00:00:00,1,"Im 10-20 minutes into this and already have heard so many false statements. Its just making excuses, blaming advertising companies for making people overeat. Its absolutely maddening. Im going to finish it, because I have to for a school project. If it turns around, Ill update the review accordingly."
