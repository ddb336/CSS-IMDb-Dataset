" Hidden secrets exposed.
",-0.0772,0.9583,2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,This film was so awesome. The inspiring story of Alan Turing and his team was so motivating and interesting. All the hidden secrets and exposure of government corruption make this one of the greater political thrillers.
" Best movie ever...
",0.6369,0.8035,2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,"If you want to learn about history or code breaking you'll find little of that nonsense here. Rather, this movie is a stark reminder that one gay guy and a woman won won the entire war and defeated the nazis. This finely crafted piece of wokeness that is not constrained by the draconian practices of truth and facts; some things are just too important for such trivialities. I would have given it more stars if the writers/directors had truly checked their privilege and made room for more POC, I mean come on!!! It's the current year!"
" This isn't how it works
",0.0,0.989,2021-03-13 00:00:00,2,"Disliking a movie due to historical inaccuracies is one thing. If this is your only issue, the movie in question may be fine as a work of fiction, just not as a record of history. But here's the thing. I don't know anything about Turing's personal life, nor about the details of how encryption played into WW2. And yet, based mostly on having a degree Computer Science, I can immediately tell that this isn't how it works. This isn't how any of this works. It's not that the movie fails to tell the true story; it fails to tell a *plausible* story.Here's an example. Turing tries to crack the encryption machine Enigma and builds his own machine to do so. Once started, the machine just keeps running until it cracks the code, without providing intermediate results. If this takes too long, all you can do is stop it manually.But that is just not how it works. No-one does engineering that way. If you write a big piece of code, it's going to have bugs. You have run parts of it and get intermediate results to find the bugs. Even if it's bug-free, there just is no reason not to add something indicating progress. That's not hard to do, and moreover, we see in the movie that Turing didn't know how long his machine would take, so intermediate results would be extremely helpful.""Alright,"" you say, ""but that's just a detail, and it's not even important to the story."" Fair enough. Here's a more important case. After the team fails to crack Enigma for a while, some random person in a bar mentions that messages encrypted with Enigma often start the same way because people use recurring phrases to open letters. This provides them with a way to restrict the search space, and they crack Enigma on the same day.Again, this isn't how it works. To elaborate: it certainly is true that knowing things about the plaintext could be extremely helpful, so good job on that. But the fact that no-one in the team figured this out after months of working on the problem is completely asinine. This is basic stuff. Of course the plaintext distribution isn't uniform; messages aren't a random sample of letters, and any capable cryptographer would consider that immediately. This is the kind of the first things you would think about, and I mean that literally. If you made a list of what properties to exploit, that would be one on the top of the list.I've singled out these two points because they're fairly objective, but they're really just a symptom of a bigger problem, which is that the movie evidently doesn't understand cryptography, computability theory, or even basic engineering -- and as a consequence, Turing is not a plausible depiction of a highly intelligent mathematician. He often says that things are too complicated for others to understand, but when he does talk about technical stuff, it's usually pretty basic, and what's worse, it's often off-topic. The ugly truth here is that neither the Turing Machine nor the Turing Test have much of a connection to cryptograhy. The Turing Machine is theoretical model that is capable to perform arbitrary computations given unlimited time, which makes it useful in formal proofs about what is and isn't computable -- where 'computable' always means 'solvable with definite, explicit rules in a finite number of steps'. However, its runtime is comically awful (it requiers thousands of steps to multiply two 2-digit numbers), so it's utterly useless on any practical problem. It's pretty telling if you watch the scene where Turing is asked about his paper; he doesn't say that the machine is the Turing Machine (presumably because that would just be too blatantly false), but he also doesn't make it clear that it's a different things, so you're sort of left with the impression that the two things are connected. They're not. I don't know what the machine did (the movie doesn't tell me), but I can promise you that it has no meaningful relationship to the Turing Machine. It's honestly just really bizarre that the movie hedges so much on that point.And the Turing Test? Well, the Turing Test is a philosophical thought experiment about when AI reaches human-level. (It's probably something that Turing got wrong, too, but that's beside the point.) How is that related to cryptography? Unfortunately, not at all. My guess is that the script writer just wanted to have the Turing Test in there because it's the most famous idea associated with Turing, so they just did it even though it really doesn't make sense. It gets away with it by being very vague, so that all you remember is a bunch of buzz words without anything too concrete to be wrong.On the other hand, the movie doesn't tell you how the Enigma Machine actually works, and that's kind of a shame. I've once had to implement it for my cryptography class as just one exercise on the biweekly exercise sheet -- point being, it's not that complicated. Take three minutes and a nice visualization, and you can explain to normal people what the machine does. Wouldn't that be better than hinting at unrelated topics without ever saying anything concrete? (I notice myself getting more annoyed with this the more I think about it. The only reason not to tell you how Enigma works in a movie about Enigma is that the movie thinks you're too stupid to understand how it works, which is kind of insulting.)Then, there's Turing's personality. Here is where I'm speculating; maybe he was like this. But I honestly doubt it. A lot of people have this streotype in their heads that the smartest mathematicians are the worst about communicating their insights, but I think the opposite is true in most cases. If you understand a subject unusually well, you're also better at explaining it in simple terms. There are exceptions to this, but given how unreliable this movie is, it seems more likely that Turing was nothing like this and the script just wrote him as the stereotype because that's what lazy writers do. Also, just keep in mind that he's a professor, which means he's working at a University. Teaching basic material is part of his job.Watching this for the second time made me think about the Queen's Gambit. Both shows (I'll just refer to this movie as a 'show' to have a common name) are about a person with an extreme genius; in one case it's math, in the other it's chess. Furthermore, both shows have pretty positive reception. However, the Queen's Gambit is great both in terms of depicting what a genius is like and in terms of the chess it shows. Here what it gets wrong: it ignores the fact that people aren't allowed to talk during tournamnets, and there is one game in the second episode where Beth says ""I don't have to move the Queen"", when that makes no sense in the position (but if it had been ""I don't have to move the King"", it would make perfect sense, so someone just messed up there). As far as I know, that's it. Everything else is spot on; the games are all based on real games played by extremely strong players, the commentary all makes sense, and the players can do the things that real chess geniuses can do (like playing entire games in their heads and playing several games simultaneously).But here's my point -- looking at the two shows side by side suggests that most people don't notice these things. They don't see the difference between a supposed genius who doesn't build a progress report into his machine on the one hand, and a realistic chess-prodigy on the other. They don't see the difference between a show that would get an A and one that would get an F in terms of technical accuracy. People probably just like the Queen's Gambit for other reasons, and its hidden qualities are incidental. Similarly, people like this movie without realizing that it's all empty talk and no substance. Even the people who give it flag for historical inaccuracies mostly criticize that it *didn't* happen that way, not that it *couldn't have happened* this way because it's just not how any of this works.So yeah. In conclusion, I'd say this movie sucks and also watch the Queen's Gambit."
" Well
",0.2732,0.6808,2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,It isn't overrated it is just overhyped for some reason I clearly saw better movies than this
" A masterpiece about one of the most important people in history
",0.7346,0.9863,2021-03-08 00:00:00,10,"For me the best part of the film was the idea itself. For some reason, there were no films about Alan Turing, the creator of the computer and the reason why we still do not live like people in the 1900s. Morten Tyldum's movie finally fills the gap.Benedict Cumberbatch's acting is brilliant, definitely worth its Oscar nomination and Keira Knightley's performance was also good. The screenplay may not be completely accurate, but it is not meant to be. There is a strong bond between the audience and the characters and thee dialogue is good. Alexandre Desplat's score is also remarkable. Had it not been for Birdman, this movie would have won Best Picture."
" Very inacurate
",0.0,0.8512,2021-03-05 00:00:00,2,"The movie is mostly a work of fiction using real names and distorting actual events. If you believe this movie you'd be left thinking Turing invented the code breaking machine all by himself but he didn't even invent the thing, what he and his team really did was improve on the machine the Polish invented. I know that's an unpopular truth for many in Britain who think they defeated the Nazis by themselves but it's a truth all the same. The personality the writers gave to the character of Alan Turing is not at all like the real Turing and according to the movie he had a very small team of people who were pretty much lost without him, in reality there was a big team of scientists and mathematicians involved in the making of the machine.If it had been billed as a complete work of fiction instead of a true story it may have some entertainment value but to completely distort a story and call it true is annoying not entertaining."
" One big lie
",0.0,-0.8744,2021-03-02 00:00:00,1,Shameful how the actual story is distorted to attribute achievements of other people to Turing. Certainly he would not have wanted that. He had own achievements and a movie about those could be made. Why so much fake? Just sad.
" A pale imitation
",0.0,-0.09,2021-02-23 00:00:00,5,"This film is almost a carbon copy of A Beautiful Mind, told about a different person: a tortured genius, a love interest played by a notable actress, doubters in more senior positions and a summary of their life's work.This doesn't mean that The Imitation Game is a bad film (by all accounts, there are good elements), but it seems like a wasted opportunity to not properly explore the brilliance and tragedy of Alan Turing's life, particularly when given a leading man of Benedict Cumberbatch's calibre.The plot is formulaic - audiences know his name, most will know his crowning achievement, so the movie merely fills in the middle of Turing's story. This results in few instances of cinematic inspiration, and too often witty one-liners or snappy conversations à la Sherlock Holmes take the spotlight off the subject.It also leans on the crutch of occasional shots of war to retain disinterested viewers, a trope that requires A) competent CGI, and B) a reason to show this. Neither is present here, making these shots seem crammed in, as well as breaking any tension (try to create drama with planes that look animated in the 90s).Cumberbatch is, as per his standard, fairly note-perfect (although I do believe Turing's awkwardness was embellished somewhat), and some of the rest of the ensemble (Rory Kinnear and Charles Dance) do their best to follow suit. I found Keira Knightley to be a bit bland, a crime as much her fault as the script's.Visually it does look good, as these larger-budget period dramas tend to, but I was mostly impressed with the visualisation of Turing's machine than anything else, and little was to be seen of any cinematography outside the norm.All in all, I think the biggest failing of this film was its shying away from tackling Turing's life on a larger scale. The end of Turing is a tragic story, but something that deserves to be told on the big screen.The Imitation Game does a bad job of bringing this issue (and its severity) to light, instead devoting all of its time to the wartime story. This shows not only a failing from the production to honour him properly, but a lack of ambition from those who chose to tell his story."
" More about emotions than the plot
",0.0,0.969,2021-02-20 00:00:00,9,"I just felt that this movie was more about the emotions, feelings and relationships than the plot. The plot is, no doubt, simply amazing. But the conflicts shown in the movie are amazing. Be it's Keira's situation where Benedict finds a solution for her or Keira herself who wants to protect him for the larger good. Nice movie. There are multiple points where you think you have hit an impasse but it's just keeps moving. Enjoyed it thoroughly."

" worst film in history
",-0.6249,0.7579,2021-02-18 00:00:00,1,"If you label a film a 'biopic', it should contain something that actually happened. WWII, Turing, enigma were real. Bletchley, and so on, real. The accounts and stories in this movie were all made up. A great man, great story, were defecated upon from a great height. Utter garbage and shame on all of you. This should receive negative stars."

" Great movie
",0.6249,0.8588,2021-02-15 00:00:00,9,I loved this movie. The story was fascinating even though it may not be as historically accurate as it should be. Most WWII movies are at least half fiction so that is not surprising. But Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant in this role as he seems to be in everything.
" Accuracy Surrendered For Drama
",0.0,0.4753,2021-01-28 00:00:00,5,"The Imitation Game goes halfway with one method of telling the story of Alan Turing and the breaking of the German code and then tries another. The film starts after the war and has being investigated by the police and has presumably gives them a reaccount of the events. This isn't clearly defined and makes the film rather disjointed. Especially when it periodically jumps back to Alan's school days with some event that has a correlation to the present. There are many other films that have taken this approach of the film being told through flashbacks:Citizen Kane, The Usual Suspects and Chaplin to name a few. All of which did a much better job balancing out the past and present.
Benedict Cumberbatch is a talented actor and his skill is well displayed through the film's keen,quick dialouge.The picture isn't really a historical film as much as it is a personal story. Many have pointed out the film's numerous inaccuracies which,I suppose, were surrendered for entertainment and drama. In those aspects the film doesn't fail completely."

" Good but fanciful story, missed opportunity
",0.431,0.9801,2021-01-06 00:00:00,6,"Alan Turing was a real genius, but he did not design by himself a machine to break the Nazi Enigma message encoding machine during WWII.Some things in the film are correct, and others are wildly fanciful and even insulting to the memory of the people at Bletchley park and elsewhere who made breaking Enigma possible.The film remains very good, engaging, well acted and full of suspense and drama. I feel a great opportunity was lost, though, to tell the real story of this codebreaking effort, which heroically and decisively shortened the war considerably without firing a single shot.For this, read a book. A great one: ""Alan Turing, the Enigma"" is very good."
" Fine story
",0.2023,0.9878,2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"There are plenty of movies taking place during WW2, but this one definitely shows a different face of the war. It was interesting to see the story of the Enigma and go through Alan Turing's life.
The movie won an Oscar for its screenplay, which was actually really good and managed to keep me focused during the entire movie, although some may say that the plot is far from reality.
The actors had strong performance, with Benedict Cumberbatch being the one to really put out a great acting and really build a strong character.
I was not a fan of the effects, scenes or editing of the movie, but it is fine since the film was a highly acting-screenplay focused movie."
" Fantastic film...
",0.5574,0.8889,2020-12-28 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely fantastic film. Top to bottom. Alan Turing is probably unknown to probably 90+% of people worldwide when in fact, 100% of people who've used anything with a microchip, which is EVERYTHING, owe at least thanks and at most unending admiration and in some cases their very lives and the lives of their ancestors, to him. I hadn't realized he'd been so abhorrently treated by a backwards society. I am perhaps more saddened due to the shame I feel because I too thought gay = bad as an ignorant youngster. This was before I realized I too was ""different"". Not gay, but an atheist. A Contrarian who will NEVER stop questioning. Where many still live today, all of these are deadly. For me, the ""different"" are the only thing that makes life interesting!!! BE WEIRD! Wonderful movie..."

This was a truly beautiful movie. I started watching this movie on Amazon prime thinking that I would simply watch the starting 15 minutes than close it, and watch it maybe later, but little did I know that I'll be hooked. And I was intrigued from the starting 10 minutes. I had to know more about the story. It's a beautiful movie. The pace is good. I was completely into the movie from the beginning, no other thought entered my mind, I even forgot where I am. I was completely into the world. The visuals- Oh my god! Fantastic, beautiful! The acting was great, it's Benedict cumberbatch we're talking about. The soundtrack was also good. I was emotional at the ending, feeling something weird I don't know the name of.

" A thoroughly gripping and engaging film

The direction was spot on in telling this story, capturing the gravity of the situation and the highlighting the incredible feat of Turing and his fellow codebreakers. I was so fully involved and engrossed. It's a hard line to tread to create both a thrilling spy tale and an emotional biopic, but this film nailed that balance.What also really highlighted the emotion and drama of this film was the non-linear story telling, which was perfect. I wasn't convinced at first but it really grew on me, and was a fantastic contribution to the story telling.Benedict Cumberbatch's performance was exceptional. He managed to portray such a complex character in a deep and thoughtful way, and I couldn't have wished for a better actor to play the part. The whole cast were exquisite in fact. Kiera Knightley opposite Cumberbatch was fantastic, and Charles Dance and Mark Strong had very solid performances in more minor roles.What I also loved about the Imitation Game was how well they recreated the period. From the costumes, to the hairstyles, to the score, the film just felt right and it all fitted together perfectly.I was also left floored by the emotion of this film. The story of Turing and his treatment after the war because of his sexuality is heartbreaking, and was captured so powerfully.Do not hesitate to watch this film. It is powerful, gripping and thrilling. A must watch!"

Neither the trailer or description of the movie showed anything about the agenda of the movie being about homosexuality but essentially that is what this entire movie was about. Also, the way he treated his fiance was horrible, essentially he had lied to her and told her he never cared for her, he was just using her. In the trailer it makes it appear that this a romance movie between him and her, but it wasn't, essentially he was a horrible person to her. And this won an oscar for best writing? How can it depict him as a horrible human being for hurting her so much with no remorse whatsover and then it wins an Oscar? It only received an Oscar because of the homosexual agenda, had it not had anything about homosexuality it would not have won an Oscar I guarantee it. HORRIBLE MOVIE - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME"

If you get the chance, visit the brilliant museum at Bletchley Park.The idea that the codebreakers would be allowed to make the strategic decisions about which messages to act on is laughable, as is the idea that on arrest, Turing would spill the entire story to a police officer."

Some give it a lower grade because of that. I don't, since I believe those who made it had the right to craft it with the mixture of truth and fiction that they felt would make for the best film.However, it seems to me that many of the details that were fictional could have been kept true to the real story and produced a film every bit as good. So I do think there may have been quite a bit of missed opportunity in that regard.Nevertheless, it was a fine movie."
" Disappointing: 'Enigma', 2001 is better...
",-0.4939,-0.9246,2020-11-02 00:00:00,6,"I've just watched a movie on Netflix... 'The Imitation Game'... It is a well-produced, well-acted film about Bletchley Park, Alan Turing, and Enigma...
and it has so much propaganda in it, it makes me sick.
It's OK with Alan Turing inventing 'the Bomb', as his machine was called. And his struggles to build it.
But it goes downhill fast when it tries to claim that it helped the Soviets to win the war, as well as the Western Allies. The Soviets didn't need BP. they had their own espionage network right inside the 3rd Reich, inside its military-industrial complex. Where even BP couldn't penetrate.
It was called 'The Red Orchestra', and they knew every detail of German plans for Barbarossa from the beginning of the invasion to the Battle of Kursk.But as with everything else, the West tries to steal all the glory for 'winning the war' and seeks to ignore that the Red Army defeated 80% of the Wehrmacht on the Russian front. They have done this indirectly with The imitation Game.
This is never acknowledged or recognised in Western official historiography of WW2.
I regard The Imitation Game. as thinly veiled revisionist telling of WW2 with the centre at BP apparently giving the Soviets information they would not otherwise have had. Shame on them, those so-called Western Allies... The same as are anti-Russia and anti-China now.
And no I wouldn't recommend the Imitation Game. The earlier movie 'Enigma' made in 2001 is a much more enjoyable and non-propagandist film. The Imitation Game just shows how anti-Russian things have become in 20 yrs."

",0.4877,-0.5927,2020-10-02 00:00:00,8,This movie is undoubtedly a well acted one with a good social message but could have been more into Turing's achievements and accomplishments rather than 'just' the war plot.
" Not the Real Turing
",0.0,-0.979,2020-10-01 00:00:00,4,"It took me a while to get around to watching this one, especially since our Computing Theory lecturer did encourage us to watch it. Well, I finally decided to do so and I have to admit that it was really annoying, and quite painful, to watch. Sure, there is a tragic aspect to Alan Turing's life, especially considering the fact that he was instrumental in helping shorten the war in Europe, but was still condemned because of the fact that he was a homosexual. However, there were aspects of the film that didn't quite sit well with me, and a little research revealed why - namely Turing wasn't borderline autistic, and he didn't get into conflict with a bulk of the people that he was working with. In fact, Turing apparently had a pretty good relationship with Commander Dennison, something that is completely ignored in the film.A part of me also felt that Turing was treated somewhat unfairly, especially since it wasn't until 2014 that he was pardoned for his crime (posthumously mind you), but I did notice that he did receive an OBE, and that was shortly after the war as well. So, I guess he was commended for his work, though ironically he still doesn't receive the accolades that he deserves, and we have to remind people that the people at Bletchly Park were just as important, if not more important, than the soldiers fighting on the ground, namely because without their work, many, many more would have died.While the film is predominantly about the work that Turing performed during the war, it does jump to other parts of his life, such as his time in school, and his arrest and eventual death, due to the fact that he was a homosexual in a world that basically shunned them. In a way the film is more about Turing than it is about cracking the enigma code, and the title of the film actually refers to the Turing test, namely a test that is used to determine whether a machine has reached intelligence.The interesting thing is that the story of computer science really seems to the a story of mathematicians looking for faster ways of solving mathematical problems, though of course in this instance it is basically cracking codes, and of course to try every single combination will no doubt take years, and the problem was that the code changed every 24 hours (and how the Germans knew what the new code was is sort of beyond me, though I suspect it might have something to do with code books). Mind you, Turing isn't my favourite computer scientists, that honour belongs to Ada Lovelace, though that had a lot to do with her being the first computer programmer long before computers even existed, though her concepts were based on Charles Babbage's conceptual design (which wasn't ever built, due to his untimely death).Yeah, I really wasn't a particularly big fan of this film, only because of the way that Turing was portrayed. In fact, I started questioning it within minutes of the film starting, and of course my research revealed the complete opposite. Sure, movies really don't work all that well without conflict, but portraying Turing as being Autistic when, in reality, he wasn't, just put me off the entire narrative."

But the movie is not only about that, it has a narrative that shows how even one of the greatest minds of his time lived a miserable life and struggled because of the rudimentary laws against homosexuality. That's kind of depressing.

Benedict Cumberbatch is really just reprising his BBC ""Sherlock"" characterisation - even down to the pensive hand gestures. The story is told from quite an interesting retrospection after the pretty unlikeable Turing has been apprehended by the police for what I suppose we'd call ""lewd behaviour"" nowadays and is being questioned by Rory Kinnear (""Detective Nock""). Indeed, I found all the characterisations to be a bit shallow - Charles Dance, Keira Knightley and Matthew Goode just lacked oomph, I thought. Fascinating story , though - beautifully well presented."

" Immy's review : Beautiful and unique biopic
",0.5994,0.9985,2020-08-02 00:00:00,10,"Overall, the movie is incredibly engaging with a stellar cast, beautiful music & cinematography, and excels as a powerful yet tragic tribute to the late Alan Turing. The film is gripping from start to finish as we follow the bizzare yet highly intelligent mind of Turing. Benedict Cumberbatch was fantastic in the role and I can't imagine anyone else playing him. Benedict morphed so well into character, depicting a socially awkward but highly intelligent man, conveyed by his small quirks and funny mannerisms. He was an absolute delight to watch. I loved the movies exploration of different themes, not solely concentrating on solving the enigma, but also detailing Turing's personal issues with homosexuality and his inability to be more normal. The movie flowed really well despite the large time jumps, and gave a thrilling build up to his machine finally working. The film succeeded due to portraying a unique and intriguing character with depth, personal issues and ambition, making his successes and downfalls that much more emotional, for example the movies use of flashbacks to his time at school and his first love with a fellow student, giving him a powerful and emotional way about him to the point that we feel immense sympathy. His character was indeed remarkably presented and you can't help but root for him, despite the pressures from the outside world. The script was extremely clever and witty, often offering wise but poignant words ; my favourite being 'Sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things no one can imagine'. Overall, this was not just a simple and one dimensional biography about Alan Turing, but a thought provoking and moving tale on a very unique man hindered by the pressures of society and the people around him, who is not given nearly enough credit for his achievements. It teaches us to not fear being different or outside of the box, and to embrace our individuality. I'm glad this movie was made so we can be appalled at the unfair prejudices of the time and honour the life of the remarkable Alan Turing. Lastly, the soundtrack is stunning. Highly recommend. To finish off, 'I know it's not ordinary, but who ever loved ordinary?'"
" A code-cracking intelligent biopic of a genius man.
",0.4588,0.9856,2020-07-29 00:00:00,8,"The Imitation Game (2014) :
Brief Review -A code-cracking intelligent biopic of a genius man. I don't care about historical accuracies if the film is compelling like this. A biographical of a genius man deserves to be told in intelligent manners and that's what The Imitation Game does perfectly. It is highly intriguing film well supported by intelligently written screenplay. The Imitation Game is based on a life of Alan Turing, a mathematician, computer scientist and logician who worked for the British government during world war 2. He invented a machine to decode 'Enigma' which helped British to win the war but he didn't enjoy fame and was sentenced for his homosexuality. From the starting point to the end i couldn't find a single loophole or loo break in the film. Yes, it is that much gripping. What i like the most about it is, it didn't lose the intelligence and subtle elements from the facts. All those scenes when Turing and his team try cracking the code are well written and very well presented. Now here many people have been unhappy for the historical accuracy on how to crack the code or how to build a machine but i am not one of them untill and unless it doesn't look dull on screen. I haven't seen much of Benedict Cumberbatch apart from MCEU series so this one is his best performance i have seen till date. His expression, accent, stammering and attitude yes i liked everything. Knightley, Goode and Kinnear supported him well. Morten Tyldum's direction is a thing to watch out for. In the begining scene he asks us to leave the room if we are not interested to listen to whatever he's gonna say and once we decide to stay we just don't even remember that thing until we finish film. May be this is something i liked the most, i just couldn't move away for moment and couldn't just disagree with anything happened in the film. Such a hold it had. Overall, a Classic that deserves more views.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest"
" A bag full of lies
",-0.4215,0.9006,2020-07-29 00:00:00,5,"In starting few moments, we see Alan is a wierdo, he is confident about being selected for the task of breaking enigma, and he expects everyone else to do whatever he says, he don't listen to anybody. From that point itself, I knew it is going to be a grossly inaccurate film. And I was right.It was shown that Alan turing has to fight everyone for breaking enigma, his fellows, the officers, the officials, everyone else was wrong. Only he got the idea to make a machine for code breaking. In reality, he never had any fight with anyone at Bletchley. Also, Cairncross was not with them.Maybe Alan Turing was not normal, but not the kind of person shown in the film. He, infact was humorous and liked to mix up with friends. Oh and yes, everybody liked him at Bletchley.Alan and team were failing to make the machine work. Then, Alan overhears a conversation and there he got an idea. He didn't tell anyone but just runs and runs, escaping the security to their work room. A little too dramatic. And it happens in every single film.In this overdramatic biographical drama, we have some unfit mathematicians along with Turing, some spies, corrupt officials, an LGBTQ story(which is true though) inspiratonal dialogues and a dozen of life lessons. All this to prove their point,""Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of do things that no one can imagine"".So, how good was the screenplay? I don't care. How good was everything else? I don't care. The first question you need to ask is if it's accurate enough. Everything else is secondary. That's where it fails."

" Fine acting but an highly inaccurate story
",0.1027,-0.9671,2020-07-19 00:00:00,6,"This was a somewhat enjoyable watch but I thought the movie was deeply flawed in its core. First off, though the general story is true I doubted much of its historical accuracy. Also its characterization of Turing was quite unbelievable. Was he a genius? Of course, we can clearly see that. But was he a flawless machine of a human himself? No. His colleagues were even made out to be completely incompetent dunces as well. Turing's character was portrayed as a cocky self absorbed man which he may well have been, but a lot of the dialogue and humor in the movie seemed out of place and very unlikely. I'm sure a lot of this has been completely dramatized and romanticized, even down to the simple aesthetics of his creation. Cumberbatch is highly praised for his role which was a good performance but failed in some areas. One in particular that I saw was his awkwardness. He was supposed have extreme difficulty reading people which at times he tried to act like that yet at other times he was witty and socially connected which goes completely contrary to that personality.The film leaves the audience with some implied or outright stated conclusions that did not sit well with me at all. The first was that World War II can be diminished down to a conflict being run by ""a half a dozen crossword enthusiasts in Southern England."" The writers acted like these few people single-handedly ended the war. This is just utterly ridiculous. It was also claimed that Turing saved 14 million lives and ended the war early by two years. That is something that you cannot possibly put a number to. There is no doubt that they achieved something remarkable and were an immense help to the war effort, but think of everyone who was involved in this and especially the men who died on the battlefields (which they conveniently avoided throughout the film even the short scenes of the war they only showed machines, airplanes, tanks and no human lives). It was really a slap in the face and a disrespect to the honor of those who fought, not to mention countless others. Having all of the information from the Axis forces would do no good if there wasn't anyone to act on it.Another idea that they insinuated was that if you are incredibly talented at something you are above reproach or that no one can ever rightly cast judgement on you. Part of that I think was their small push of their own opinions on homosexuality. I think they were trying to implant their own views on the subject as a way of subtle under-the-radar propaganda. I am not saying that Turing wasn't unfairly treated in the end, but they make him out to be a flawless god-like man who could do no wrong just because of his intelligence. The film really avoided the subject of him and his inner demons, not to say that that should have been their main focus.His demise in the end was also very unclearly presented. A robbery, a forbidden relationship, and the other events surrounding it were spattered throughout with no real explicit telling of the facts. It was just another problem near the end that made this movie not nearly what it is cracked up to be."
" Tragically Flawed
",-0.5719,0.9311,2020-07-17 00:00:00,6,"I have mixed feelings about this film. It purports to being based on a true story, but it diverges from truth so many times that the story bears little resemblance to the truth. The real shame is that the historically accurate story is very compelling. And sometimes attempts to dramatize history result in well-intentioned, but lazy, writing.The basics elements of this film's story are important and thrilling; they need no literary embellishment:1. Britain's survival during WWII---especially during the bombing of London---was a miraculous feat of will. The film provides a view of an important part of that effort.
2. Alan Turing is an iconic figure in the history of digital computing; his singular contribution to the war effort is a fascinating story.
3. Anti-homosexual prejudices, codified in English law, yielded many tragic consequences.Viewers of the film can refer to Wikipedia's entry for the ""Enigma Machine"" if they want to gain a basic understanding of how the film strays from the truth. And trivia entries in IMDb elucidate further.Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing is wonderful to watch. If only it stuck to the facts. The film, as a whole is moving. If it were totally veracious, it would deserve a ""10"". If only it stuck to the facts.Every attempt should be made to inform viewers of actual facts, especially when those facts are altered in a filmic representation of actual people and/or actual events. Writers and directors have a responsibility to their audiences. I suggest that variances from the truth be spelled out at a film's end, before the credits."

" Best of Benedict Cumberbatch
",0.6369,-0.7351,2020-07-11 00:00:00,8,"The Imitation Game is a historical drama based on the life of the genius British mathematician Alan Turing who played an important role as crypto analyst in deciphering the Enigma machine- an encryption device used by the Nazis during WW2 to transmit code messages. The script stretches over 3 time periods: Alan's school life- where he was bullied and where he met with the tragic loss of his love interest, his life at Bletchley Park and the post war period where he was punished for his homosexuality that preceded his suicide (Homosexuality was a crime then). Historians estimate that breaking Enigma shortened the war by more than two years, saving over 14 million lives. Turing's work inspired generations of research into what scientists called ""Turing Machines"". Today, we call them computers. Unfortunately Alan Turing was never acknowledged enough and for 50 years his work was kept secret.His character is played by the immensely talented Benedict Cumberbatch who blends well with the roll of Alan Turing. Keira Knightley is superb in her role as- Joan Clarke, a lone female involved in deciphering enigma. Although this movie combines facts with fiction, it is an impeccable thriller with an emotional roller coaster attached and with a pace that keeps you hooked throughout."

And the task of bringing a brilliant mind to the screen in a way that is understandable to the general public is even more complicated. However, Morten Tyldum does it in 'The Imitation Game' in a way that is both human and extraordinary.
The film does not present the character of Alan Turing as someone totally unattainable and incomprehensible, it shows us as someone very intelligent and very closed, full of secrets. But the way he brings him closer to the public for true empathy is to approach him in the most humane way possible, not as a perfect genius, but as a person full of flaws. And clearly this would not have been accomplished as well had it not been for Benedict Cumberbatch's incredible performance as Turing. The actor manages to reflect in each scene, in a very genuine way, the complex mind of this character beyond his intelligence.
The film shows us the mind of a genius in a very simple way, a job that is not easy at all. It is easy to follow his thoughts thanks to the vision of the director and the absolutely good performance of Cumberbatch."

The society, though, benefits greatly from those very idiosyncrasies.The movie is meticulously well shot - taking us back to the war-era.

" Computer science got the backseat
",0.0,-0.4664,2020-04-28 00:00:00,4,"As a software developer, I was interested in this film because of the computer science aspect, particularly during a time when computing was essentially non-existent. Alas the story was overwhelmingly about his personal struggles with repeated flashbacks to his school days and random shots of Benedict Cumberbatch running really fast.The actual computer science side was incorrect because Alan Turing did not invent and build the Bombe (the machine with all the rotating things) from scratch by himself as portrayed in the movie. The British bombe was a development from a device that had been designed in Poland, the initial design being from Alan Turing but the engineering design and construction was undertaken by an entirely different company. It was an official project so the scene when the machine had been running for a day and he fights to keep it running is almost certainly fabrication.While speaking of fabrication, when the machine finally does work in the movie, they happen to decode a really significant message but Alan Turing supposedly decides that they have to keep the news to themselves in order to hide their new capabilities. Not taking action based on every intercept did indeed occur but in real life if he had done that he probably would have been executed for treason! A decision like that resulting in massive loss of life would have been up to the admiralty or the Prime Minister. It simply was not his decision to make."

An unexplained genius image is brilliant under the interpretation of Benedict. Turing, the film presented to the audience, is a lonely person, and there are no more intimate people around him.

" A brilliant film about a brilliant mind.
",0.8225,0.9982,2020-04-17 00:00:00,9,"This film is based on the life of Alan Turing, the father of the modern computer. He is a truly remarkable character, responsible for the era of technology in which we live and one of the most brilliant people of the 20th century. This film focuses mainly on Turing's effort, during the Second World War, to decipher the secret codes of German military communications, hitherto undecipherable. The film, however, also addresses the issue surrounding Turing's homosexuality.As it was a period film based on a book, I was already expecting some mishaps to the true story, and it was unsurprisingly that I read some reviews where it was mentioned. But I am not the best person to evaluate this because I do not know the figure of Alan Turing in detail, nor did I dedicate myself to read that book to see if it shares the same flaws. But yes, I admit such possibilities and, given that it is a period film based on a true story, this is something that I personally penalize. I am one of those people who understand that, in these cases, freedom of creation must be well demarcated. Another thing I would like to understand better is whether the book, like the film, takes Turing's suicide for granted, since there were serious doubts about it at the time. Aside from these reservations, I had no major problems with the script that, without giving too much detail, sweeps the scientist's life very close to death, making use of the flashback to visit and present situations from the past.Morten Tyldum ensures effective and competent management. He is a director I didn't know yet and who has been circulating more on television, but he did a good job. Benedict Cumberbatch, whom I only remembered seeing play secondary roles and the villain of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"", had his opportunity to show value and did not disappoint. He was devastating in the main role, complex and psychologically challenging character. The work paid off well, and although I haven't seen many of the films he came in after this one, seeing his filmography here on the website is enough to see how much his career has benefited and grown. Next to her is Keira Knightley, a veteran of period films, with an already solid career. Rory Kinnear, Matthew Goode and Charles Dance also did a good job.Technically, there is little to say about this film. The filming and photography work was well done but the exquisite editing and post-production effort, with all those flashbacks, stands out particularly. The soundtrack, by Alexandre Desplat, is to be congratulated and remains a little in the ear after the film ends. The sets and costumes are excellent and I think they are faithful enough to the period portrayed.Oscar winner (Best Adapted Screenplay) was nominated for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Edition, Best Soundtrack and Best Production Design. Not being a perfect film, I think it was relatively close to that."
" Funny genius
",0.4404,0.995,2020-04-16 00:00:00,9,"What kind of person is Alan Turing? He was born in public school and graduated from King 's College of Cambridge. He received the education of the elite intellectuals in the tradition of corruption. From one aspect, he has always been in a well-protected, as long as there are scientific research problems, he can be happy Live in the environment. Turing was shy and sensitive when he was young, and he was not good at expressing his feelings in words. After he opened it, he did not understand the human world and did not know how to use political means to achieve his goals. The Turing of Guan Fu presents such an image to people. He worked hard and could not understand the intention of his colleagues to order him to eat; he insisted on his deciphering method and hurriedly explained to the army leaders who came to inspect (this super cute paragraph). He did n't even know how to talk to his sister ...
But on the other hand, Alan Turing in reality, and the two skills of dumb and poisonous tongue ... he probably belongs to the kind of person who never understands the air and always speaks straight. Instead, it won him the love of his peers and juniors. When he was at Bletchley Manor, there was always a group of brains around him.
Contrary to the doubts and entanglements about homosexuality in the movie, Turing actually ... never concealed his orientation. When chatting, he simply came out with his colleagues when he found an opportunity. Of course, the techies did not agree with his orientation, but they finally accepted him.
Turing usually likes to wear pajamas with a sports jacket instead of a suit that highlights his body in the movie (Fortunately, the movie chose a suit and can lick and lick). On a formal occasion, he would wear ... a formal jacket.
Turing likes to ride bicycles and long-distance running, and almost represents the United Kingdom in the Olympic Games. Therefore, Juan Fu will run around in the movie. The reason why he likes long-distance running is to relieve the pressure (serious face) that no one asked him.
Turing also has a somewhat cute attribute of pollen allergy, so that people around him are not surprised that he wears a gas mask to work. Saying that I really look forward to Juan Fu's tears and allergies, or a gas mask face! It is a pity that this stalk is not used in the movie. Only in the last question and answer from Turing with the detective did the line ""I am allergic to pollen"".
Turing can also drink a pint of beer in one go. Seeing here, did you think of Professor X in the first love of Cha Nan! That's right. At first, my brain supplement to Turing was like him!
Turing is still a big hand writing little yellow text, which is true. When he was investigated by the police because of his gay identity, the police asked him to write a statement. He ... wrote five pages of paper with beautiful words and fluent sentences, describing the relationship between him and his lover in detail and vividly. The police I was shocked. I didn't expect this person to be so straightforward.
Having said so much, if I want to evaluate this movie objectively, I can only say that it only depicts a short period of Turing's undulating life; it also shows only one aspect of Turing's personality. It will allow more people who have not even heard the name ""Turing"" to understand this great scientist, knowing that it is his job that ended World War II for several years in advance. On the other hand, Turing's other scientific achievements, the bold and forthright aspect of his character, and his bloody love life can only be found in the original biography. So everyone is going to read the biography! It's really burning and rotten!"
" Excellent performance

" A Heart winning masterpiece
",0.8176,0.8757,2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"At the very beginning of the movie the viewers got the glance of what they're going to witness thoughout the movie though a deep, self explanatory disclaimer by the protagonist Alan Turing( Benedict Cumberbatch)-""Are you paying attention. Good.......Pay attention"". Here the mastery of the director Mortem Tyldum came into play. Alan Turing along with his fellow mathematicians were pushing themselves to break into the unbreakable Enigma and instead of the hostility of the commander (Charles Dance) and his fellow colleagues he ended up building his mighty machine which was brilliant enough to put the in favour of Brutain.By Alan's - ""God didn't win the war......"" Mortem cleared of not making the viewers believe about anything like God. Keira Knightly, was just brilliant along with Benedict, acted as Joan. The part that anyone can barely accept in the movie was the attack on the a passenger didn't even tried to make stop evokes a heart rendering truth. This movie also taught us how a saviour can end up his life as a prisoner. This is not a tale of tragedy but of triumph. An affecting tale of an extraordinary human being."
" A little bit of movie watching
",0.0,0.9392,2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Regarding the advancement of the plot, the film uses three time periods to narrate the story, mainly in the period of World War II Turing cracking the password, supplemented by the student period and the middle age period. Although the three time and space switch back and forth, but the plots do not contradict each other, but instead take care of each other, the connection is very perfect. The movie begins with a mysterious monologue in the interrogation room, ""Are you paying attention to listening"" ""If you don't listen carefully, it's easy to miss something"" ""I won't say the second time"" plus Juan Fu gloomy 'S voice, the soundtrack full of suspense colors, gave the audience a strong sense of anticipation, and this mysterious beginning certainly has a perfect correspondence with the ending.The characterization of the characters is also quite in place. Turing's game with the general during the interview for the secret position allowed us to see that although Turing spoke a little strangely, he was clever and courageous, and then gradually told the audience that Turing was a bit through the scene of the car accident between him and his partner. The out-and-out ""weird man"", his own way, no one in his eyes, confusing words and deeds ... In short, in the eyes of others, it is a nasty ghost who is difficult to get along with. The story slowly reversed, gradually telling us why Turing is Turing. This process also caused people to have compassion for him. Later, the appearance of the heroine helped him get along with his partners, and it made people discover that Turing was not an annoying person, but he also liked some places. The setting of the heroine made the character characterize And the development of the plot is more reasonable. All in all, when portraying the image and character of a character, it is not only vivid, but also the reasons for the character.There are many profound topics in the film, the theme is divided into two, one is to reveal the cruelty of the war bit by bit through the process of a group of geniuses to crack the German intelligence, and trigger the audience to think about the war. When the password is deciphered, the brother of a partner will be sacrificed and the whole movie will be sublimated there, which has a profound philosophical significance. Another theme is the autobiographical narration of geniuses. ""The greater the power, the greater the responsibility."" Although this is said, but the glorious surface you see is easy to make you take for granted, but you don't know the cruelty behind the characters. Growth process. These two themes also lead to branch topics such as campus bullying, sexism, and injustice suffered by homosexuals. The various branch topics seem to be unintentional actions in the main story of the protagonist, but they are actually intentional. The time when the various branches of the topic unfolded was up to the point."
" The Man Who Saved Britain
",0.4215,0.9991,2020-04-03 00:00:00,8,"The story of the breaking of the German Engima code during the Second World War is one of those incredible real-life stories filmmakers seem drawn to, like moths to a flame. That seems due, in part, to some of the remarkable figures involved with the effort. One of them was Alan Turing, a young Cambridge mathematician whose work not only helped crack the code but give birth to the modern computer age. Helping tell Turing's story to a broader audience is 2014's The Imitation Game, with Benedict Cumberbatch as the man himself.Let's be honest: If you were going to cast someone to play Turing, you could a lot worse than go with Cumberbatch. The man who had brought to life a modern-day Sherlock Holmes and, before that, Stephen Hawking in a BBC TV movie, clearly had a pedigree for bringing to life those blessed with genius and eccentricity. Even so, his performance as Turing stands as something of a triumph. All the facets of this incredible, if at times distant, man is there on display with Cumberbatch finding ways to play them with both subtlety and, at times, explosiveness. The shift from vain to vulnerable can happen in the blink of an eye, the raising of an eyebrow, and Cumberbatch presents all of that wonderfully. It's a remarkable performance, and it is no surprise there was an Oscar nomination in store for his work.Elsewhere, Cumberbatch is given ample support by the supporting cast. Keira Knightley's Joan Clarke is a prime example of this, a little known figure in her own right, whom Knightley brings to life with a performance that hits all the right notes. Turing's fellow codebreakers are likewise well-cast, from Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander to Allen Leech as John Cairncross. One good bit of casting is Alex Lawther as the young Turing, offering the viewer an elegant depiction of the up and coming mathematician. Elsewhere, the film features a procession of the UK's leading character actors from the likes of Charles Dance as Commander Denniston to Mark Strong as MI6 chief Stewart Menzies and the ever-reliable Rory Kinnear as the policeman looking into Turing in the 1950s. It's a choice cast and one that brings out the best in their roles and, ultimately, Cumberbatch as Turing.The Imitation Game is also a handsomely made film. From the cinematography of Oscar Faura to the sets of Maria Djurkovic and the costuming of Sammy Sheldon Differ recreating Britain of the forties and fifties, it's a gorgeous film to look at, rich in detail. It also sounds impressive, thanks to the score from Alexandre Desplat which is every bit as idiosyncratic and remarkable as the performance of the film's lead, capturing the intricacies of the moods and racing mind of Turing, as if musical quicksilver. Brought together under the direction of Morten Tyldum, it's an impressive combination that elevates the film that much more.And then there's the script from Graham Moore, an Oscar-winning one at that. Working from Andrew Hodges' biography of Turing, Moore crafted an immensely compelling piece of work, one that highlights so many aspects of Turing's life and works. Yet, Moore frames his story around what, ultimately, became Turing's downfall, meaning he would never be known for his work during his lifetime. It's a remarkable story, without a doubt, and Moore finds ways to turn an often complex narrative into something understandable for those who aren't either mathematicians or experts on the Second World War. It also means, at times to the detriment of both script and the film, that there's the invoking of cliches, not to mention stretching of historical facts to their breaking point. That isn't to take away from Moore's achievement or what the film does, but perhaps suggest why such a remarkable piece of work has the occasional air of being formulaic at times.Even with sometimes playing to a formula and stretching historical truth, The Imitation Game does a fine job. From Cumberbatch's performance to the work of its cast and crew and even the finer moments of Moore's script, it succeeds beautifully in bringing to life again one of the remarkable minds of the 20th century. For that reason alone, it stands out as a piece of filmmaking worth seeing."

And while I can agree that there are historical inaccuracies, I think the well-intentioned reviewers are missing the point.This is not meant to be a pure biographical piece that details the life of Alan Turing with perfect accuracy. It's a story.If they mentioned that the machine was already half-built by the poles the challenge would've seemed less impossible and the task less impressive, leading to a less satisfying ending.If they had everyone on Alan's side from the start, and write to Churchill together, it would've seemed like Alan didn't have to overcome the personal problems and lack of social skills. Leading to a less satisfying character development.If they had Turing quickly concluded to eliminate common words from the possibilities in coded messages, then there wouldn't be any tension.If they Turing's team had no idea what the broken codes would be used for (Sometimes saving lives, sometimes letting them die) then there would be no consequences for the decision they made to let the ships be sunk. And continually choose whether or not to let the germans carry out their plans.If Turing didn't tell the detective his story, he wouldn't have gotten to ask the detective: ""Am I human? Am I robot? Am I war-hero? Am I a criminal?"" Which for me at least, was one of the most impactful lines of the entire film.So, were there inaccuracies? Of course. It's a film after all and ""BASED on a true story"". But if the writers had stuck to history instead of using creative license, this would be a far less compelling story. It would have far less impact. And many of the people who enjoyed it, likely wouldn't have ever even seen it.In the end the irony was that Turing didn't get to enjoy the world he helped protect. And if this film's goal was to protect history, we wouldn't have gotten to enjoy it."

" Thrilling and Tragic in turns--but apparently fictional
",0.0258,0.8667,2020-03-11 00:00:00,8,"Everyone who has studied computer science or mathematical logic knows who Alan Turing is: the father of artificial intelligence, largely responsible for the computer revolution which has transformed all of our lives. But do they know what he did during World War II?The Imitation Game presents itself as the fascinating story of how Alan Turing managed nearly singlehandedly to break the Germans´ Enigma code and consequently save the lives of millions of people by shortening the war by two years. It´s a great story--no doubt about it, but looking over some of the negative reviews, it appears that the story as relayed has been severely fictionalized.As a fictional film, I cannot find fault with The Imitation Game. It is too bad, I suppose, that the filmmakers took excessive liberties in order to make a better film about a real historical figure. That said, The Imitation Game does manage to convey the difficulties faced by intelligent and marginalized people (in this case, homosexuals back when it was considered pathological) in coping with government bureaucracies.I recommend this film as a work unto itself.

Behind every code is an enigma .Unlock the secret, win the war .An enjoyable biopic based on the real life story of legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing, the movie portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his expert team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II. Main cast and support cast are frankly well . Main starring Benedict Cumberbatch is terrific along with Kiera Knightley . They are well accompanied by a very good support cast as Matthew Goode , Rory Kinnear , Allen Leech , Matthew Beard , Charles Dance and Mark Strong playing Stewart Menzies, who is the basis for Ian Fleming 's boss ""M"" in James Bond series . It contains a rousing and sensitive musical score by Alexandre Desplat . As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Oscar Faura . The motion picture was well directed by Morten Tyldum .Adding more remarks to his biography , these are as follows: Alan Mathison Turing (1912 - 7 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. In fact , Winston Churchill stated that the Bletchley Park codebreakers made the single greatest contribution in Britain's war effort. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it's hard to estimate what effect Ultra intelligence had on the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. However , Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that ""gross indecency"" was a criminal offence in the UK , as he accepted chemical castration treatment to avoid prison punishment . Rating : 7.5/10 . Better than average . Well worth Watching"

",0.5994,0.9954,2019-10-29 00:00:00,4,"Consider this the textbook example of Oscar-bait. Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Alan Turing, a brilliant and influential mathematician and computer scientist who helped decode the Enigma machine that the Nazis were using to send encrypted messages (this saved countless lives) and was later prosecuted for being gay and forced to be chemically castrated. It's an appalling story that this movie does no justice.The first fatal flaw is its portrayal of Turing. Apparently getting all of its information about genius mathematicians from movies such as Rain Man and A Beautiful Mind, Turing is portrayed as a sort of savant like character who is incapable of social interaction (in real life Turing was not like this). Benedict Cumberbatch is solid, but you can't help feel like he's playing only a slightly altered version of Sherlock (socially inept, eccentric, brilliant). There are other numerous historical inaccuracies as well (it's a movie so full historical accuracy is not needed, but just don't expect to get a good history lesson here).The other main characters in this film are okay to forgettable. Kiera Knightly is fine as Joan Clarke, another brilliant codebreaker who struggles to gain acceptance because she is a woman. We unfortunately don't get enough time with her. Charles Dance is the tough military guy (he's got a good tough guy routine) and Mark Strong is the mysterious spy. Both completely forgettable.The script suffers too, mostly playing it by the book with cliches we have seen a thousand times before. There's a corny inspirational line that gets a call back not once, but twice! And there's a eureka scene in a bar that feels like a direct rip off of A Beautiful Mind. I have no idea how this won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.Overall, just go and watch A Beautiful Mind. Or go and watch it again if you've already seen it."

" I don't know if I should give this a 10 or a 1...
",0.0,0.9004,2019-10-14 00:00:00,10,"I have deeply conflicted feelings about this film. It is one of the least stuffy, stagey biopics I have seen. The screenplay very cleverly splits Turing's life into 3 sections and inter-splice them to give a general impression of the Turing's state of being. Unlike most biopics it does not feel like a encyclopedia entry of first guy did x, then guy did y. ETc. It feels like a story.Best of all the film uses something like a Turing test as the central image of the film. (spoilers?) Turing was arrested for gross indecency because he was gay and the film builds the flashback structures around a (fictional) account of him being interviewed by a cop. It is only at the last moment the confession is presented as Turing asking the cop to judge his humanity based on what he says. (This notion of the ethical implications of a machine passing the Turing test is not at the forefront of Turing's idea but an obvious consequence of them). It is striking how this structure demonstrates Turing's idea.The film's technical aspects are wonderful. I especially like Cumberbatch's performance. And Knightly gives a very good performance as well. The directions finds a nice balance between being thrillerish and drama.But for all that it really, really bothers me that Turing's work on cracking Enigma is presented as almost a single handed achievement. The work by the Polish intelligence service and Polish mathematicians is completely ignored. (This is not trivial, through statistical analysis they were able to decode about 60% of messages). The movie makes it seem like only one decoding machine was built, and by Turing himself. In fact over 200 machines were built and a whole slew of engineers were involved. Etc. The film even got the order of cribs (i.e. working from known words to crack the code) wrong. The Victory (aka Christopher) machine was built starting from a crib and it wasn't an idea that occurred to Turing at the least second. This really beefed up the social isolation of Turing to a degree that was unwarranted.Likewise, the film does not shy away from Turing's gayness as a fact. And more importantly it does not whitewash his suicide. To the film's credit it presents the societal oppression quite correctly. But Turing is weirdly de-sexed. His gayness is presented as an academic aspect of his life. There is no scene that shows him being intimate with another guy. The love story in his youth is weirdly chase.In the end I think I really like this movie but I don't know. I guess 10 today will work."
" Beautiful movie yet with ""fabricated truth""
",0.7351,0.9528,2019-10-12 00:00:00,6,"I honestly loved the movie and the way it was filmed but after digging more into the story there were many fabricated and twisted events. Alan Turning was not the first person to crack the Enigma Machine, but a Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski in 1938 (after 6 years of building the machine ""Bomba""). Alan Turning was not hated as much as it was shown in the movie but he was supported instead.
But all in all, Benedict Cumberbatch did an amazing job as Alan Turning."

" Enigma and the Imitation Game.

The Imitation Game goes further in the descrption of how Alain Turing and his colleagues managed to break down the Enigma code.This time the name of Alain Turing is written in big letters and is worthy of all the honours for his great contribution.
The Imitation game is a fascinating story, a run against the time for decoding the German military code.
Finally the performance of Benedict Cumberbatch is really great, but the performances of Matthew Goode, Keira Knightley and other actors are very good."
" Beautifully done.
",0.5719,0.8956,2019-09-19 00:00:00,10,"Based on the life of mathematician Alan Turing, The Imitation Game is the beautifully told story of a brilliant and persecuted man who played a major role in ending World War II. Played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Turing joins and eventually leads a British team in creating a machine capable of decrypting highly sensitive German communications. Their successful work turned the tide of war and eventually led the allies to victory. His story is poignantly juxtaposed against his future self, where he tells his story to a police investigator while being investigated for (and eventually convicted of) homosexuality. It also explores parts of his young life, including his first love and the beginning of his interest in cryptology. Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, a member of Turing's team who becomes his closest friend and, eventually, fiancée.
Directed by Morten Tyldum, the film brilliantly and seamlessly moves between Turing's childhood, the years he spent working on Enigma (1939-1945), and the period where he was persecuted for homosexuality (1951). There are plenty of clues that help the audience place the time period, making the back-and-forth movement uncomplicated. For example, in one scene we see the police detective trying to track down Turing's military records, in the next, we see Alan approaching a World War II-era military vehicle where troops are loading up. Narration (from Turing's interview with the detective) is pulled in and used to tie the time periods together at times.
The film uses montages extensively and skillfully. In one short montage, the screen shoots between conflicting scenes rapidly to show the link between these scholars' work and the war. It effectively portrays the effects their important work has on the war and hints at the effects that their momentous decisions have on them emotionally. A close-up of someone completing a mathematic equation is followed by actual footage of soldiers firing machine guns at targets. Bombs dropping, men dying, and the intelligence director opening up a document that surely came from Turing's group is followed by Alan running at a desperate and punishing pace. Through this montage, Turing is narrating what the war was like for their group. He vividly describes the years after their breakthrough, using evocative phrases like ""blood-soaked calculus"" and ""fleets of ships weighing down the oceans."" The dialogue here is stunning, but it is very nearly eclipsed by the emotionally consuming visuals.
The film is darker, with heavier themes than The Theory of Everything, another film that came out that year. Both are about extremely gifted men who were forced to confront momentous issues in their lifetimes. However, Imitation Game capitalizes on the magnitude of Turing's work by creating a suspenseful yet emotional film and weaves it skillfully with Turing's later plight with oppression. These two time periods were the most significant times of his life, and yet they really had little to do with each other. I'm not sure a film about his life could have left either time period out, nor could it have woven the two together more brilliantly. Tyldum's film about Alan Turing's life, accomplishments, and the tragedies that befell him is both engaging and bittersweet."

" Exploring an Enigma
",0.0,0.9968,2019-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Norwegian director Morten Tyldum's English-language debut ""The Imitation Game"" is the type of movie that seems custom built for awards recognition. This classy historical drama explores the life and contributions of a man whose impact would not be acknowledged until many years after his tragic & untimely death. That man was Alan Turing, a mathematician who played a key role in breaking Germany's ""Enigma"" code during World War II.The screenplay is loosely based on a biography of Turing and, from what I understand, it isn't shy about bending the truth for dramatic effect. Personally, I don't find this to be a problem because the story is compellingly told and none of the fabrications or exaggerations strike me as being unreasonable in the name of entertainment. If you're only interested in stringent historical accuracy then you probably shouldn't be watching movies to begin with. That being said, for what it's worth, the screenplay was rewarded with an Oscar, which was surprisingly the only major award that the film received.The cast is comprised of a fine group of British thespians, with Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role. Cumberbatch is always good but this might be his best performance to date. Also notable was Keira Knightley in an Oscar-nominated supporting role. The rest of the cast is a model of professionalism and features the likes of Mark Strong, Matthew Goode & Charles Dance.From a production standpoint, the movie does an excellent job of recreating its period setting, from sets to costuming. Morten Tyldum's direction is nicely handled and the movie also sports a score from Alexandre Desplat (one of two Oscar-nominated scores from Desplat in that particular year). Overall, certainly a prestige picture whose individual components all show considerable care and attention.Although ""Birdman"" & ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" hogged most of the awards recognition for 2014, I think that ""The Imitation Game"" is right up there with them. Sure, it may play fast and loose with the facts but it sheds light on an important subject, all the while giving us a fresh perspective on World War II. I certainly don't have any reservations in recommending it, though you've been warned about what I feel are justified liberties taken with the truth for dramatic effect."

All of these parts of WW2 are well known by everyone. But there are parts of WW2 that need to be acknowledged and given credit for.This film is based around the fact that during WW2 the Germans had developed a code machine that they used to communicate with its army and every 24 hours it would reset itself and change to another.So failure after failure of having pretty much an army of people taking a wild guess of trying to crack it by hand Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) stated that he was going to develop a machine (The Bombe) that would crack the code daily as it needed to.The acting within this film and the actors who played their roles was pretty much perfect. Benedict Cumberbatch played Alan Turing incredibly well as well as Alex Lawther and you could see how their presentation of the character were very similar to one another. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke was done well as well as Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander.The Plot was actually very easy to keep up with and was always able to keep your curiosity.Overall if you are someone who is interested in certain aspects of WW2 this is definitely something to learn from"
" 'The Imitation Game' = only Alan Turing's Absolute brilliance as Logician could break the 'Enigma' code (and save millions of WWII lives).
",0.7964,0.9967,2019-06-29 00:00:00,9,"The 2014 film 'The Imitation Game' and the story of ultra-brilliant 'outsider' Alan Turing is important and fascinating in a number of ways. On the large-scale it presents the positively incredible concept that sheer 'brainpower' could in effect undermine/defeat the fiercest of armies (i.e. Nazi Germany) = by breaking/decoding the unbreakable 'enigma' code-transmissions, providing the Allies with vital information on movements of enemy warships, bombers, etc.The decoding-effort was thought by many to be virtually impossible, but Alan Turing made the intellectual 'jump' head-long towards the direction of designing one of the first 'thinking-machines' (soon to be know as computers), to tackle the seemingly insurmountable feat! The artificially-intelligent Turing-machine came through with flying-colors and made the world safe for people that just wanted to live in peace, freedom and civility (or did it?!)That's the great irony of Alan Turing's authentically tragic story, His unprecedented brilliance and ultra-creative logical successes, probably won the War for our free-World (or at least shortened it considerably), and saved millions of innocent Lives - but unfortunately the still archaically-unsympathetic (irrationally-cruel) Laws of his own British-Isles homeland (as of the early 1950's) essentially sealed his dire fate, facilitating the taking his own life thru cyanide poisoning (by not allowing him to be judged solely on the 'content of his own character' - subjecting him to a brutally-inhuman 'chemical-castration' which probably hindered/ interfered with his previously astonishing powers of concentration - and also not giving him full credit (at the time) for his astoundingly crucial code-breaking achievements during WWII (partly because his achievements were highly classified in the midst of a burgeoning 'Cold-War').It seems doubly ironic now, in the age of I-Pad/I-phone, where even the 'common-person' places essential reliance on these 'thinking machines' = that might never have come into existence if not for Alan Turing (and other key artificial-intelligence 'founding fathers' like John Von Neumann and Marvin Minsky).Actor Benedict Cumberbatch gives a positively uncanny performance as Turing = fully-transmitting Turing's other-Worldly 'outsider's' brilliance (as well as his palpable social awkwardness).If I had a slight critique, its in the pacing and 'focus' of this film = I think the drama builds well in the second-half, with some extremely powerfully moving scenes towards the end) - but some of the early scenes seem a bit unfocused (and unfortunately the earlier scenes between Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly seem to lack sufficient 'chemistry' and seem a bit 'forced' although I have to say that their final scenes together are quite emotionally-resonant!Overall, I enjoyed this movie and found much of it quite insightful - just wish Alan Turing himself could have been cognizant of how much his ground-breakingly original ideas about artificial-intelligence have genuinely shaped/influenced our 21st Century, and beyond!note: Charles Dance gives a brilliantly intense & intimidating portrayal as 'Commander Denniston' = Alan Turing's bureaucratic superior and foil thru much of this film!"

False 'facts', twisted interpretations, manipulated history... have all served to make me very suspicious of ""Based on a true story"" movies. Although they're described as such, but only transiently at the beginning, they are invariably passed off and accepted as literal fact.I don't know for sure, but I very much doubt that one of the team was a woman... and I'm not being sexist by saying that. It's just that my suspicion is that it would not have been the case in that day and age. I suspect it's yet another film industry appeasement to political correctness.Similarly, although Cumberbatch is a very good actor, I just get the feeling that the real Turing was not the insecure, inadequate, socially inept eccentric he's portrayed as.However, the film is extremely well made, excellent production values with great attention to contemporary styles/fashion, and is directed well.Although I'm never particularly keen on Rory Kinnear, he was adequate in his portrayal of the detective snooping into Turing/Cumberbatch's background.In all, I wonder how much of this movie is actually true to historical fact. This is what upsets me and puts me on edge. Films to do with real historical events should *stick to* precisely the fact... they should not be twisted for any reason, and the least reason for political correctness.Regardless, although I personally feel this film deserves a rating of approximately 7.7, I shall round up to an 8."

I saw a lot of biography films on local TV channel by accident but never carefully watched it in details. I always find that biography films are very boring and nothing to make me interested in. So, I'm always avoid those kinds of films.I only watched this film because it went into Oscar nominations. When I was checking out the Oscar nominations that year, I've found this film was one of the nominated and I was surprised when I read the plot. Moreover, Benedict Cumberbatch was in it, so, I decided to watch.I always find that whichever films Benedict Cumberbatch is in, they are kind of great films like Sherlock produced by BBC. I love his performance. The way he talks, the way he performs, I love all. That's why I watched this film and I was amazed because of it's quality. The film is so great. Even though the film is based on the second world war, but it's still doing great and I totally love the film.What I love of this film is the proposal scene. It's so funny and cute in some way. Too bad for Joan is that Alan is homosexual. Otherwise, I want Alan to end up with her.Another scene I love is how Alan find his members. That scene is kind of funny and I love those words which one of his members said after Alan solved the Enigma ""you just solved Enigma....."". When I saw that scene, I smiled.Although those scenes are great ones, the final scene is so sad. Alan is a great guy. He doesn't deserve all that happened to him, especially, his homosexuality. I guess at that time, homosexuality was banned, so, Alan has to go though hell.The final scene makes me angry. All they tried is just to see how strong/secure their code is? When I saw that scene, I really want to hit them.All in all, this film is so great and so enjoyable. Although it is a biography film and I thought it would make me bored, but it didn't. Moreover, it is the best of best biography films I've seen. I would recommend you all to watch because you won't regret watching it since it's a great film."
" It looked well-done and it was
",0.0,0.9919,2019-05-05 00:00:00,8,"The Imitation Game is a great film. It is set very well with good visuals to depict the time period. The soundtrack is phenomenal, all of the music is great and fits the theme. The way the movie moves in time is smooth and really adds another layer to the story. When watching, I noticed those things but more than those the two things that stood out to me were as follows. The writing, the writing is extremely well done and keeps you engaged and wondering throughout. This writing evel works well in the form of narration which most films tend to stay away from because they fear they will do it poorly (unlike this one). This leads into the other thing being the man himself Benedict Cumberbatch. The cast is good and well acted; Benedict steals the show (as he should). He absolutely accels at playing an anti-social awkward super genius, similar to his role of Sherlock in the hit show 'Sherlock'. However what is different from his role in Sherlock is how he portrays himself here. He has crafted the perfect character here that feels very far off from Benedict himself. Beautiful acting and writing overall (and the cinematography is pretty good too)."

It shows a very important part of both the technology and its importance and the social aspects of what was happening at the time.I hope that more people will choose to watch this film because it truly is an important piece."

",0.0,-0.9378,2019-02-26 00:00:00,9,"This is a fairly accurate representation of the incredible life of one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. There were some dramatizations added to the movie, but these are relatively mild diversions from the true story. Benedict Cumberbatch does do a very good job of realistically portraying Turing. Parents should know that some portions may be intense for young kids as Turing died very tragically; he committed suicide at the age of 41, and this is mentioned at the end of the film. Though the movie does feature some sad portions to it (particularly in a touching scene at the end of the movie where Turing breaks down because of how he has been treated for his ""crime""), there is also some humor throughout the movie. The main focus of the film is on Turing's code-breaking efforts during World War II (with some mention of his other contributions to mathematics and computing), and so there is some violence shown related to World War II. This is a very good movie that brings the work of a great mathematician to light."

It is elevated however, by its sharp and poignant themes. The film is not just a war movie, a biography, or a mid-century costume drama; it is a tragedy about closed-off societies which abuse those who are different. It is a look at a heartbreakingly backward time that destroyed a man. With these emotional and mental ideas powering the already-engrossing film, The Imitation Game becomes a remarkable piece of work."

" Good but it could have been much better
",0.7003,0.9841,2019-02-01 00:00:00,7,"This film is based on the life of Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), an Englishman who headed a team that decrypted the Nazis' Enigma code during World War II. Through flashback and flash-forward, three time periods are exposed: Turing's childhood in a boarding school in the 1920s, the war period, and his post-war life beginning in 1951 after he had been convicted for being sexually involved with another man.""The Imitation Game"" is successful in recreating time periods long gone. The middle war-time section is the one that is given the most time and it is rightfully filled with excitement. After reading Wikipedia's comments on the film, however, it seems that many liberties were taken to embellish the historical truth for dramatic purposes. While this works most of the time in film, it is questionable in this case - not only for the large number of changes but also because at least one posthumous reputation has been harmed.I believe the film would have been more effective with a different time structure. The rare early flashbacks were perfect and complete. Young actor Alex Lawther (young Turing) is very powerful in a scene in which he is given bad news while his face shows how well trained he already is in upholding a stiff upper lip.I believe that the other two sections should have been linear and included the time period between them. It would have been intriguing to see the transition from post-war glory to adjusting to regular life as well as the terrible times during and after Turing's conviction. This last section included a very moving scene that was well acted between Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley who played Joan Clarke, the lone female on the team of cryptanalysts (whose story might also make a fine film).Sadly, this last period of the film had such a limited time, it felt more like an extended footnote. It deserved more emphasis. There might have been more genuine drama if the middle section had less embellishments and the later section exposed more of the real drama - the heartbreaking irony that a national (and international) hero was prosecuted by a cruel law unfairly relating to private conduct.Cumberbatch's best acting is in this last section. In the middle portion, he does a fine job as someone who is work-obsessed and emotionally withdrawn but this later section clearly shows a man who is broken and heavily medicated. There is also little evidence in the movie that show's Turing's homosexuality aside from various comments. In exposing more of the post-war period, Cumberbatch's performance would have been elevated from one that is very good to one that would have been outstanding."

" Disappointing dramatisation
",-0.4939,0.8877,2018-12-29 00:00:00,3,"I had high expectations of this film, having already read Graham Moore's fine historical novel ""The Last Days of Darkness"". This was an ambitious, and in my view largely successful, to tell the story of the rivalry between Westinghouse and Edison for the control of the electric power industry.
Regrettably, Moore's success as a novelist has not carried across into screen writing. He had first rate raw material: what could be more fascinating than how the British broke the German codes in WW2? And did it with such subtlety that the Germans were never aware of it.
Let me be clear that I would not criticise a writer for simplifying events, merging characters or telescoping events. These are necessary to condense messy reality into a drama that can be absorbed in two hours or so.
I do have problems when a writer completely mis-characterises the protagonist as a socially dysfunctional victim of autism/Asperger's when Turing in fact was not like that at all. Turing did not get engaged to Joan Ckarke. Hugh Alexander did not threaten to destroy a computer called Christopher with a hammer, not least because the computer was not called Christopher. Commander Denniston was not a prickly martinet.
These dramatic fabrications pile up to the point that the film simply loses credibility in the eyes of those with respect for historical authenticity. I am surprised that many reviews have been taken in by the Hollywood sheen and have failed totally to register obviously crass histrionics and stereotyped characters.
The acting was top class, the concept was simply amateurish."

" Well crafted but mostly fictitious film about Turings involvement at Bletchley Park
",0.1406,0.5911,2018-11-11 00:00:00,5,"This is well-made and well-acted film, with an important message. However, the danger with films like this is that the masses think they are getting a history lesson, but in this case they are most definitely not.The film takes enormous creative liberties all the way through, by adding conflicts where there none; by portraying Turing as if he were autistic when he was not; and by inserting a number of fictions about Turing's character and achievements.Perhaps the most glaring fictionalised part of the movie, which will no doubt upset many historians as well as the descendents of those actually involved at Bletchley, is the lie that Turing singelhandledly invented and built the machine that could break Enigma's code. The machine was actually invented by Polish crytanalysts before Turing even started working at Bletchley! Turing's involvement came later, when he helped mathematician Gordon Welchman (who is not even mentioned in the movie) designed a newer model that looked for likely letter combinations.I also want to mention that the conflict between Turing and Denniston (played by Charles Dance) is completely fictional, and Denniston's family have taken issue with the film's negative portrayal of him. Denniston picked out Turing based on his work at Cambridge, and Turing never went to Winston Churchill to complain, and Denniston never tried to fire him!Contrary to what the film depicts, Turing was an approachable person with a keen sense of humour, and was well liked at Bletchley. There are many more inaccuracies, such as his lack of knowledge of German, his dislike of sandwiches and the scenes about his compulsions regarding carrots and peas. All of this is fiction. I could go on... but I've pointed out the main issues I wanted to raise.So once again, as with so many bio-pics (recent examples being Churchill and Dunkirk) an opportunity is missed and we are presented with a mixture of fact and fiction - fiction that goes well beyond what we generally call artistic licence, to the point that people living today connected to those war-time efforts are deeply offended."

On the one hand, I think it's a difficult act to achieve, but you could see a character absent from reactions, I would have liked to see a little more of the inner character and explore other áreas. In addition, the character of Joan Clarke played by Keira Knightley, is a great woman with a great ability to be part of a great team capable of master strategies, although I would have liked to see even more of that empowerment, more of those actions than the led to overcome the obstacles against women. Out of all that, the film perfectly managed to combine two sides of the life of Alan Turing and managed to show the influence of each other in other areas of his life.

The film is about the life of Alan Turing, a mathematician who always had great hability in mathematics as a child, but this caused him problems with his schoolmates because they treated him very badly and made him cry.Alan Turing did an interview to work on the decoding of 'enigma' with which the Nazis sent the codes every day, for the war, and which contained information on where to attack, as was the weather that day, among other things and in the end they concluded with a Heil hitler. He was not good at working as a team and one day he was left alone and he reasoned and came to the conclusion that a machine could think faster than the brain. Alan Turing, after all, invented a machine to decipher the code of the Germans during World War II. That was the most important contribution the English made to end that war. So important was this man to build the world we live in now.
This movie is amazing because it shows a man who fought for his goals and achievements, as well as the role of a woman. It was a film totally recommended, it is full of passion and sadness as well as realism. It's amazing, thanks."

",0.6588,0.9975,2018-10-05 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the best movies that I've saw in a long time, I really liked this film because it focuses on different aspects of Turing´s life: it shows him and his team trying to break Enigma, it shows Young Turing during his time at boarding school, and the events after the war; so it's a very complete story.What makes this movie very interesting and emotional is Turing´s personality, because he is a little egocentric and arrogant with his team, but little by little you can see the reason of his personality, so you can understand Alan's behavior.Another achievement of the movie is the great atmosphere, it captures the ambience of England during 1940 with great costumes and locations. In addition, I think that Keira Knightley does a very good job as Joan Clarke, she really transmits a lot of feelings to the viewers. But definitely the best part of the film is when Turing deciphered the enigma after several attempts, it is a scene full of suspense and joy. My only criticism of the movie is that it could include more details about how Alan made the machine, to understand more about how it worked.
In conclusion, ""The Imitation Game"" is a great movie, besides having fun watching the movie, I learned a lot about who was Alan Turing and the importance of his invention, I think that the filmmaker achieved his goal because there is a balance between reality and fiction, I mean, although it´s based on true stories, it isn´t boring like other movies of this type. I recommend this film especially to curious people, because it explains in an interesting way the origin of something that we use in our daily lives: computers. In my opinion, Alan Turing was a great mathematician that everyone should know, since his invention is one of the greatest in all history.So next time you´re using your computer, don´t forget to thank the man who invented it: Alan Turing."

England is being attacked by the Germans and they can not stop them. Hitler and all his Nazi people have a code to plan their attacks without England being able to prepare. Then they gather a group of the best mathematicians to be able to decipher the enigma code. It seems an impossible mission because this code changes every 24 hours. Until finally, Turing creates cristopher, a machine that by entering the code in it after a few minutes manages to decipher it. 
This movie has an excellent plot; I think it does explain his goal of showing what the situation was like in England during the War. My favorite part is that one of the mathematical experts who decipher the code is a woman because it is good to see how women also consider us capable of doing great things.
I recommend this movie a lot because it has a great message that no matter what obstacles come up, we have to look for the way out of our problems. And if we believe in ourselves, we can achieve great things."

I highly recommend this movie if you are interested in knowing a bit more about history but not boring, if not more dynamic, it is a very good movie and I recommend it 100%."

",0.0,0.9584,2018-09-23 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed the movie, since it introduces you to a World War II theme which in its essence is compelling, but if you're one of those people who knows the real story you will most probably hate this movie. I want to review this movie by itself, not relating it to the real life story because in the end it's just a movie.The cinematography is straightforward, somewhat special at the beggining of the movie but slacking as the story develops. It doesn't provide a special element to the story: it just portrays (which is fine, I personally enjoy when cinematography has a play in the development of the story). The storyline is full of plotholes that contradict with the screenwriting itself. I quote a previous user who said ""if sexism was so prominent in that time of history, why would she have 2 important math degrees?"", as well as ""by portraying Clarke as an emotional element in the movie, it's contradicting the fact that she was portrayed as the smartest of all of them, by not actually serving as such an important figure in that matter"". The storyline, being far from the actual happenigs, is also weak in the aspect of not being original, since it's the same as any other Hollywood movie that sells millions.The acting is superb, the story is weak, the cinematography is simple."

The transformation with Benedict Cumberbatch was a great change. He looked like a whole new person. He looked a lot younger. The props looked pretty good for this movie. It looked like a real lab. The CGI could have been better. There was some plot holes that they filled with typical scenes from other movies. Overall, The Imitation Game is a great World War 2 movie. I would check it out."

Well, it depends.The chemistry between Cumberbatch and Knightley is perfect, the other performances are also good. The plot isn't anything special, it also had pretty weak moments (e.g. the scene where colleagues support Turing). The atmosphere of the movie felt a bit unbalanced - some parts were dense (e.g. Turing's dialogue with Menzies), other parts not as much.Historical accuracy is not worth a dime - Turing's persona is simply portrayed as Aspie, breaking Enigma also happened in a little different way but for the sake of the drama I'm able to accept those simplifications. Howerver, there were several biographical movies done in similar style before and Immitation Game doesn't offer anything truly exceptional to make it more memorable experience."

I sat down to watch a Hollywood film representation BASED (however loosely) on a true story. So, I think we all need to relax a little on how ""horrifically"" inaccurate this film is - nobody is writing textbooks based on this film, the facts are out there so let's all just enjoy a good old movie shall we? Acting - 10/10, story - a teensy bit predictable but none the less captivating. Benedict Cumberbatch deserved his Oscar nomination without a doubt, an incredible performance, that did not slip even for a second. Kiera Knightly and the supporting cast again, outstanding.

Any other year, Benedict would have been a shoe-in for the Oscar for best actor but to come up against Eddie Redmayne in his outstanding performance as Stephen Hawkings was just cruel timing. If ever there was a year for a tie for best actor this would have been that year. And this takes nothing from Kiera Knightley who is fantastic in the supporting role. She shows here true acting prowess in ensuring that the importance of Joan Clarke's role in the work at Bletchley Park, all to easily attributed to the men, is not diminished.Simply put; a must watch film."

The music is very good written and added to the value of the scenes. However the direction was average and the story really didn't present that historical incident well and focused more in Alan's sexuality. Also it was predictable and had no worries watching it knowing that it will happen and they will break the Enigma code and that was the challenge to make you doubt that it will happen and present the suffering and work done to achieve it and focusing on it's result and on the war too and it's effect on it. The characters were very full of stories and feelings that could have been used instead of having unnecessary scenes and focusing on how to present the smartness of Alan's mind not telling us he is a smart and has a different attitude than others and you know that it will work in the end. Also small Alan was different than the big one that I felt the small one was performing another Alan with a mental disorder.Also Keira's character wasn't powerful or had any difficult scenes to present her well. However the movie is full of good scenes with performance and music and irresistible to watch.

Benedict Cumberbatch gives an insightful performance of an introvert who's driven to the edge of what's possible and maybe beyond.
Of course, the screenplay is made for a modern audience so it isn't perfectly true to the actual events to deliver some entertainment along historical facts but one can easily forgive that. The acting was good with the surprising exception of Keira Knightley who left me somewhat underwhelmed yet above average. Hence ""only"" 9 stars. This movie is a must for any nerd like me!"

" A potential boring movie, turned into a compelling drama by Cumberbatch
",-0.1027,0.7479,2018-05-28 00:00:00,8,"The Imitation Game is a drama about the efforts of Alan Turing (Cumberbatch) to break the Enigma Code, which plays a significant role in ending WWII.The Imitation Game has the elements to be a boring drama, with standard cliches and some story elements that feel rushed. Turing is portrayed as an autistic person, unable to work with a team and unable to have social relations. So of course a big part of the story is how he creates a relation with his team and future (ex) wife. Needless to say there are elements of betrayal. Such as Turing ending his relationship because he is gay. Sarcificing soldiers in order to protect their decoding success. And of course the spy who leaks to the Russians. All these parts are rushed and don't add to the story, partially because of historical inaccuracies.The reason why that doesn't bother the movie, and why I still rate it an 8 is for the simple fact that Benedict Cumberbatch is nothing short of brilliant. Rarely have I seen anyone playing such complex emotion in a person who is unable to emotionally connect. Cumberbatch acts with his body language, words, voice, eyes, stutter, and with compelling silences. Cumberbatch, and Cumberbatch alone is the reason why the movie becomes compelling and interesting from the start to the end."

Alan must keep all kinds of secrets, both personal and at a government level. It is estimated this man who received no recognition during his lifetime saved 14 million lives and shortened the war by two years.While I have heard the name Turing as the inventor of the modern computer during WWII, I had no notion about the man behind it.Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

" Great as a film, annoying as a true story

But there's something deeply frustrating about the decisions behind the screenplay. It clearly focuses on Turing's unfair persecution for being gay - this is the tragic element that we're left with as an audience. Which is absolutely worth a story, for sure. But if that's your angle, then why did they focus on enigma/bombe and miss out so much of his contribution to modern computing? They make out he pretty much worked alone on designing/building/running the bombe (called Christopher in the film) which is just unnecessarily false. I'm still waiting on a decent film or mini-series to portray the incredible events of what happened at Bletchley during the war: it was truly a collaborative effort. Gordon Welchman has just as much input as Turing on the bombe machine, which was first invented by the Poles anyhow, and built by engineers at Letchworth. There were eventually many bombe machines - not just one that Turing seemingly built with his own hands in a hangar-sized 'hut' (the huts were a lot smaller). The whole design/point of the bombe was to exploit a flaw in the enigma, requiring a 'crib' - a known phrase like 'heil hitler' used in the film, which they could match up alongside the cypher to extract patterns. The film delivers this discovery as a eureka moment at the bar, well after Turing has built the bombe! Which makes no sense and is confusing to the viewer as to what the original intentions of the machine actually were. The film implies there was a spy in Turing's team. Really - is this kind of cinematic device really necessary to keep audiences engaged? Was the REAL story not interesting and exciting enough?! When told properly at least. There are far more angles to the story - how so many misfits/outliers were brought together to collaborate on genius ideas, with huge determination and drive. The idea that the seemingly impossible can be achieved. Its a really inspiring moment of history that should surely be pushed more in today's world. Its a great film ciematically, but its annoying how the personal agenda of the book's author and film's screenwriters biased the film away from truth towards one aspect of Turing's life, and in doing so failed to really do either angle as much justice as was deserved. It might have also been fitting to have shown how much sexual abuse happened at Sherborne school when/where Turing attended, which continued well through the 20th century according to well researched documentaries and reports, but I guess that's not quite as pleasing for sunday afternoon cinema audiences."
" Gripping from start to finish

But because of Benedict Cumberbatch's outstanding performance I was gripped from start to finish. I wasn't very familiar with the story of Alan Turing but I knew he cracked the Enigma and had to hide that he was gay for many years. But that was pretty much all I knew.
The film enthralled me. I payed attention to every single thing that happened in this movie. And that payed off at the end. At the end of the film some text appears telling us that Alan Turing committed suicide through cyanide poisoning after undergoing Chemical Castration for 2 years. When this happens you see the team throwing their work into a fire whilst cheering and laughing. This ultimately made the film even more emotional.
Through Cumberbatch's incredible performance you really see how attached he becomes to his machine ""Christopher"" and it was truly emotional to watch
I have to recommend this too everyone interested in history or film in general"

This might have been more down to expectation and preference, considering the machinations of the device are fascinating to say the least, than anything else, though, since the slight bait-and-switch is actually a welcome one. It allows for a much more personal stake in all of the action, though the balance could have perhaps been a little finer. What we have is, for the most part, a character study on a figure so often noted yet perhaps equally misunderstood. The flick is an interesting and tragic insight into his unfair and borderline inhumane treatment. It is engaging for its duration, even if it can be a tad slow and sometimes slightly strangely structured. 7/10"

His success at that cryptoanalysis work is kept secret which prevents him to be recognized as a hero who has largely contributed to shorten the war time and thus saving millions of lives. Besides that he is always being harassed by his superiors to deliver quickly that code decipherment. By the way this story is based on real events.

After much work and some intervention from an intelligent woman, he will create the first computer known to man, which will ultimately have to face the Enigma encryption machine.It's an excellent biography, which manages, with the help of its great cast, to deliver a very good imagining of the last part of Alan Turing's life, in which he manages to create one of the most important inventions of mankind. His troubled life is presented in-depth, with its many bumps and blockades which he must face in order to see his dream come to life, dream which will play a determinate role in the upcoming war.

" Fantastic source material, so-so execution
",0.5574,0.9568,2018-01-25 00:00:00,5,"The Imitation Game is the story of Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a 20th century mathematician, who is known as the father of theoretical computer sciences and the breaker of the Enigma machine during World War Two. He's also the inventor of the Turing Test, in which a machine is to be said intelligent if someone conversing with it cannot tell whether it's a man or a machine. Which makes him the father of artificial intelligence as well.What a fascinating man, and to the film's credit, the actual story cannot be watered down. The film focuses on Turing's career as a World War Two codebreaker and his invention of a machine capable of breaking the Enigma machine, which the Nazis used to hide all their important messages, making war intelligence rather lopsided in their favour. Now, to be fair, the film is rather famously historically inaccurate. Turing was nowhere as near autistic as Cumberbatch shows him, he didn't really quarrel with military leadership, he didn't confront any spies and while he was homosexual, it didn't define his life like this film is trying to claim. And that last part is a big problem in the film. Sexual equality is an important subject, certainly, but with Alan Turing there is so much more to talk about. I'd be much more interested in finding out more about his theories concerning artificial intelligence than I am watching him figuring out his feelings about male gender. But now the movie takes its sweet time raving about homophobia, effectively splitting the narrative in half, with neither side coming out feeling whole and fully realized.Still, the majority of the story is interesting. Not a perfect film, but a serviceable period drama no doubt."

I really didn't feel any emotion for the characters, especially in the flashbacks. Even when Turing is breaking down because of his persecution for his sexuality, even with the excellent acting from Benedict Cumberbatch, I still felt next to no real emotion for the character. You can't just plop down a character, say he's gay, say he's persecuted, and make him cry and expect me to feel for him, no matter how good the acting is. You need to flesh out the character and make the audience connect with him. Same thing goes for the scene where they are forced to let one of the team's brother die. I knew nothing about the character or the fact that he had a brother up to then, and I had no reason to care.I usually don't care to much about a movies accuracy to reality. If it's a good story and an entertaining movie then who cares if it's accurate? But this movie seriously annoyed me for a few reasons. Turing's character is unbelievably exaggerated and it ultimately hurts the movie. He's shown as a genius asshole who doesn't understand how to act human. This does not make him likable in any way and it does not make the story more interesting. The story itself is very inaccurate as well, skipping some parts, overemphasizing some parts, and straight up inventing other parts. The real story many not be as ""audience friendly"" but it is much more interesting. There was no reason to warp the plot so hard.At the end of the day, it has flat unlikeable characters, a meh plot, and creates no emotional investment. I am physically incapable of comprehending the fact that this got nominated for best picture, especially with so many other great movies out this year."

There is not a boring part, from start to finish it keeps you hooked up.Despite some inaccuracies, after watching the film you know who was Touring and what he did. But the film conveys much more than history, it conveys emotions and teaches a well-balanced lesson. I am used to historical films in my country, Spain. Even or specially the ones with more money/budget and great costumes, try to present modern ideas in old times and they comit two sins in my view, creating evil creatures without taking into account the customs of the period and offering a highly pesimistic, dark vision of the past in Spain, as if in the past people were unable to have happy moments. This film, however, even criticizing the period, recognise the efforts of everybody and shows a positive picture of Britain and the people in that period. I envy that fair treatment.Individuals, without taking into account their political, religious or particular things, are the key. But the thing I like most about the film is its capacity to transmit emotions till the end. **********************SPOILER**********************
In the end you see a man broken by the doings of those who will never make any difference, touching scene with ""her wife"" and the crossword.

Although the movie takes place during the second World War, no guns, shooting, killing, or too graphic scenes are showed. Some intense scenes could be when several families are in the subway hiding from bomb blasts during a raid (short scene, about 5 seconds). A man is convicted of homosexuality in a society where it was not acceptable. A boy's young friend dies of a disease and affects him very much. A sexual joke is made in a bar where a man wants to put his **** in a woman's mouth while she hums a song (as a joke).Overall:This film is excellent, loving World War Two history, this movie captures what actually happened in London. It may not be extremely historically accurate, but for what it is, it is one of the best World War/Mathematician movie out there."
" A truthful glimpse into the unique life of Alan Turing
",0.4588,-0.6109,2017-10-21 00:00:00,8,"The Imitation Game is a honest and truthful glimpse (or at least as truthful as a Hollywood movie can be) on the life and works of Alan Turing, one of the founders of modern Computer Science as we know it. Now to be sure, the greatest work that Turing did was formulating the theory of Turing machines and decidability, but since that work is not really exciting or dramatic enough, the movie focuses on his work on breaking the cryptographic Enigma code used by the Axis in the Second world war. Now I was slightly disappointed during the first half of the movie, focusing on the usual melodrama involving unsocial and mis-understood geniuses, love interests, 'traumatic' childhood memories, uncooperative bureaucracy, unknown spies and double agents, etc., but Turing lived a unique and singular life, and the second half exemplifies this. As Turing understood so well, while breaking the Enigma code was a challenge, the even harder problem was what to do after it was broken, and how to use all the un-encrypted information strategically so that the Axis would remain blissfully ignorant of their vulnerability. The movie unfortunately does not dwell much on this exciting storyline, which could have provided a much more interesting and unique look at what was going on behind the scenes in the Second world war. The final years of Turing's life were a tragedy, and fortunately, the movie does not shy away from these ugly details. We can only wonder at what discoveries Turing could have made if he had been allowed to work with freedom and support. But, be that as it may, Turing's legacy will continue to live on in the future, and for us mortals, the immortality of their works and ideas, their name is the greatest achievement that we can hope for."

",0.0,0.953,2017-08-31 00:00:00,1,"Falsified history. Enigma was cracked years before WW2 by Polish mathematicians - in 1932. They cracked several versions of Enigma machine, they created mathematical models, a few versions of Enigma machine prototypes, basing only on encrypted data, and they created tools for decrypting messages. Suddenly Germans and Soviets attacked Poland and the possibility to continue their efforts has been lost, so they decide to get through to Great Britain to continue their efforts, and Alan Turing help them to create more powerful tools for cracking more advanced Enigma codes (brute force approach), but his participation was only partial. It was the great success of: Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski, Jerzy Różycki mostly - not Alan Turing!"

",0.0,0.9965,2017-08-29 00:00:00,9,"Alan Turing was a fascinating, complex person who deserves to be better known to the world. Likewise his story is important and deserves to be told rather than forgotten. Had high hopes for 'The Imitation Game', after hearing so many good things about it, and it ended up being one of my favourite films of 2014.That 'The Imitation Game' is historically inaccurate and has distortions didn't offend me as much as some reviewers, biographical dramas are notorious for this so it's come to be expected by me (not that that is meant to be an excuse). All that was wanted was a film that made me think, moved me, was well made and well acted. 'The Imitation Game' was all those things and more.It isn't perfect, the political elements are on the preachy side and there are a few strands that could have gone into more detail, Turing's sexuality should have gotten into more depth than it was.However, 'The Imitation Game' is exceptionally well made. It's immaculately photographed and has some of the best production design of its best, especially in the costumes. The direction allows the film to be absorbing, while the music score is often hauntingly beautiful and never intrusive.In terms of the script, 'The Imitation Game' does a wonderful job in provoking thought and providing emotional impact and nuances and fleshes the characters out with remarkable complexity. What could have been potentially dry treatment of the subject matter turned out to be fascinating, thrilling and very moving.Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best performance of a very solid career, an outstanding portrayal that won't be forgotten for years to come. Keira Knightley is a sympathetic confidante and Charles Dance is excellent as always as his superior. The supporting cast are without complaint.Overall, wonderful film and its acclaim is a long way from an enigma. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

I was about to forget that Alan Turing is a real person while watching because this story is so unbelievable. Without doubt, he had a big influence on history and contributed to this world. This film is about a genius man who encloses the code during world warⅡ. Cumberbatch plays Alan's suffering and his personality that is poor to express his emotion and communicate with others successfully. He achieves amazing things for his short life in accompanies with his secret, homosexual. His life is strongly impressive for me. Especially, the ending is moving and made me cry. I think little people know about him and I suppose that there are a lot of people who is not known though they contributed to the world. One of roles of films is that those who is not known for people is paid attentions from audience through seeing a film."

However, decrypting code is hard to do alone.This film is about real British mathematician Alan Turing. In this film, he is a very proud man so he never change his opinion easily and usually believe himself. Actually, that is bad for team working bad he was enthusiastic. Sometimes, like him, we may have to be stubborn believing ourselves although if the mates think of us as troublesome.So, he was a unique person and he has distress so I think it was difficult to act as him, but Benedict Cumberbatch acted him literally well. In fact, Time magazine selected him as first place of the best actor of the film in 2014.I often watch action films and don't watch films like this because those are mostly boring, but this was not.

" The Imitation Game - Movie Review
",0.0,0.9981,2017-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Since I was a child, I have love war films. Those ones were full of action, amazing battle sequences, and realistic visual effects that made that war, real. But when I saw The imitation game, I was surprised for how this movie It's about war, but doesn't have action in it.Recently, I watched this movie again because I haven't seen it in a couple years, and this movie has got even better with the years that have passed. It's a masterpiece, but now let's talk about why The imitation game it's so good.This movie It's about Alan Turing. A person really good at solving puzzles and also very good at math, has to decode Enigma. Enigma It's an unbreakable code that was made by the Nazis during WWII so they could communicate with each other and organize an attack. So the plot of this movie It's about how Alan Turing and his team decode this code to win the war. That's it, I mean there it's a lot to talk about the plot, but I won't tell you more about it because in my opinion that will be kind of spoiler territory.Moving on to the filmmaking of this movie, first, it's very well directed. Morten Tyldum did such a good work directing this film, the way he cuts the scenes, the camera-work, the editing, It's looks fantastic and when I watch this movie makes me feel that I am in this time period. The script of this film it's so well made that this movie feels real, suspenseful, dramatic, and emotionally powerful. All this characters are so well realized that you look at them like they were real people trying to solve this situation and end this war that is killing everyone.The performances are all great, Benedict Cumberbatch it's one of my favorites actors in the world and as Alan Turing was amazing. This is the best performance that I have seen from him in any movie or TV show. I love him as Doctor Strange and Sherlock Holmes but, if i have to choose one, I choose Alan Turing. Another one that shines it's Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, great performance and it wasn't a surprise that she was nominated for best actress in a supporting role.The imitation game it's a beautiful movie, is such a great and important achievement. This story should be known by anybody, really make yourself a favor and watch this movie."

The story was alright, emotions were fantastic, acting was phenomenal, characters were alright, and the dialog was great, but this movie had a few short comings that just couldn't go unnoticed. This film had the ability to be such a great movie, but was bogged down with some boring characters, and unnecessary plot points. If it were up to me, I would of focused solely on the story of the team breaking the Enigma, and less of Turing's life. The movie opened with such a bright story and ended with a really depressing epilogue, and because of that I just didn't feel a huge connection to this movie at all. Overall, I gave this film a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or an 7 out of 10, since there were some really good, and really just eh parts to this film. If you're looking for a drama filled, realistic film with huge amounts of Cumberbatch, then this is your movie.

" Historically flawed and grossly unfair.
",-0.6124,0.7896,2017-06-21 00:00:00,1,"I believe that other users have covered the many faults of this film. The only point I want to make is that if the writers wished to create a period drama set in and after WWII, they did not need to trivialise the immense contribution of one of the true geniuses for the 20th Century. Just choose an imaginary character and concentrate on his sexuality, if that's what you want to do. There is no reason to pretend that the most interesting aspect of Turing's life was that he was gay! We are all sick of Hollywood rewriting history but this film seeks to discredit a great human being."

The phrase ""Sometimes it's the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine"" also touched me a lot. I was surprised by the intelligence of this fantastic mathematician - Alan Turing, I will remember his contribution to the whole world in the WWII and he has brought peace to everyone."
" Alan Turing – Inventor of computers!
",0.0,0.5679,2017-05-26 00:00:00,9,I generally like the nerd nature. In this movie character played by Benedict Cumberbatch (Alan Turing) attracts you very much. The movie has a peculiar quality to keep you engaged till last. His bold nature in not caring much for anybody also attracts you. The movie than shows you about how Alan learns to behave with his other counter parts while gradually cracking the Enigma code.It's sad that the inventor of turing machines (computers) gradually commits suicide for he was being treated (medically) wrong.Highly Recommended.
" Intrigue Makes Up For Flaws
",0.0,0.9751,2017-05-23 00:00:00,7,"The Imitation Game is a film that tells a story everybody should know. It's nice to see a war movie that takes a different approach from films like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, and show the technical sides of war.Benedict Cumberbatch gives one of the best performances of the year, and all of the supporting cast members deliver on their roles as well. The movie is so intriguing and interesting, you will stay invested in this movie for the whole run-time. Watching Alan Turing try to solve the enigma code while getting along with his co-workers, trying to keep his job, and hiding his sexuality all add so much depth to the story. This is definitely a film that will have you invested the whole time.This film is pretty great, but sadly not flawless. There are a few pretty cheesy moments, and the flash forward scenes can be hard to distinguish from the present events. The film also has a tendency of missing opportunities with certain plot lines. For example, there's a side-plot about one of the mathematicians being a soviet spy. Once the soviet spy is revealed, they do nothing with it for the rest of the movie, probably because it's so close to the end of the film and they need to wrap it up. There are a few other plot lines that I personally felt the film could've done more with.Despite it's flaws, The Imitation Game is still worth seeing. It has an amazing performance from Cumberbatch, an amazing setting that nails the WWII vibe, and a story that everybody should hear."

It takes its source into reality, which makes the film even more poignant. The fact that we almost don't see fighting scenes reinforces the intellectual side of war, with maths and computer technology. Nevertheless, some scenes are quite repetitive and there comes the boring aspect of this film."
" If you've never heard of Alan Turing, this is the film for you
",0.0,0.9481,2017-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10I came into 'The Imitation Game' knowing quite a bit about Alan Turing. He comes into conversations about science, mathematics, history and civil rights. I had seen the 1996 BBC drama 'Breaking the Code' starring Derek Jacobi, as had Benedict Cumberbatch, who has said in interviews that Jacobi's performance of the role influenced his own. For this version though, the focus is more on the effects of Turing's autism on his life than of his speech impediment.This is Cumberbatch's forte: characters who are right all the time, about everything, but communicate poorly. He's got the charisma to be likable even while behaving (on the face of it) badly toward people. In fact, he heads a cast featuring Mark Strong, Keira Knightley and Charles Dance, all doing the exact types of performances at which they excel.Turning this kind of story into a drama faces an obstacle that doing maths and breaking codes in rooms is not inherently cinematic, but the screenplay does a good job of getting around this by various means. Graham Moore's script is excellent in many regards. Also, I would like to point out some great location scouting and set dressing.My only hesitation is that... Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think The Imitation Game adds much to the knowledge of even a fairly educated layman. There's very little new information here, and some questions I had remained unanswered. It covers the basics in an engaging, dramatic, insightful way, but if you are coming to this to expand your knowledge of Turing, you might want to look elsewhere instead."
" Alan Turing: saved millions of lives through artificial intelligence, and killed by human stupidity...
",0.1027,0.9943,2017-05-08 00:00:00,8,"World War II wasn't won on the battlefields but on the field of intelligence as information was the nerve of the war to the point the Allies not only needed German information but to let false ones leak from ""spies"" or arrests in order to mislead the Axis. Secret as well as human intelligence were involved but WWII allowed a third form of intelligence to rise.When Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is applying to a job in Bletchey Park, things don't go as well as expected, his commander Denniston (Charles Dance) opens the door, ready to throw this cocky self-absorbed prick away, Turing utters one word: Enigma, and Denniston closes the door. And I was enthralled already by the premise because Enigma was probably the only name I remembered from a 2000's documentary series about how the world war was (really won) and I knew Enigma was beaten by the ancestor of our modern computers.I'm a math buff and a real nerd who loves crosswords and plays on words, so I could relate to Turing who took Enigma as an intellectual challenge, on which millions of lives were pending. The Germans had made a machine that could encrypt codes made of complex and apparently random sequences of letters and with a new coding system each day, which makes a combination of billions and billions of possibilities to work on every day and after midnight, having to get back from scratch, over and over again. Even by hiring people working on different codes without stopping, day and night, the amount of time required to break the codes would be counted in millenniums.Alan Turing leads team that includes a champion chess player Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) and later, a crossword prodigy Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), but only he knew it would more than human minds to break Enigma, his project was to create an artificial intelligence, a universal machine to do the job at faster speed than human brain, imitating our brains process, our maybe improving them. The film chronicles the process that allowed him to get to decrypt the code and while it works on the thriller level, there's more to appreciate, ""The Imitation Game"" is not just a study on math and information but on fascinating man who finally gets his long overdue recognition.While striking as an individualistic snob, Alan Turing gets progressively more complex as we get hints of his past experiences with bullying and a growing childhood romance that leaves no doubt about Turing's sexuality. In fact, it is very fascinating that his passion for cryptography came from the 'I love you' messages he sent to his friend, as if math wasn't just a passion, but an area of total freedom, a mirror of personal truth where he could express himself to the fullest. He had made math his own world, but only with the value of team-working, he could overcome the obstacles, including the patronizingly antagonistic attitude of Denniston.But I didn't care much for these 'dramatic' bits that, while not unbelievable, were not worthy of such a complex personality, I doubt that Denniston could really order to destroy the machine or if he submitted that deadline. The film also suffers from similarly doubtful moments: I couldn't believe Joan Clarke wouldn't want to join the team, I mean didn't a MI6 official tell them that they were serving the country? She was just contemptibly dismissed by a nosy clerk who took her for a secretary and now, she wouldn't take part to a project because her parents thought it wasn't correct? The film didn't need these moments, Turing's story was enough good material.I must admit I was first perplex about the part involving his sexuality but it became apparent that this was a part of Turing's life that couldn't be overlooked because it highlighted the tragedy of a man who saved millions of peoples' lives but never got the credit he deserved, on the contrary, he faced a public indignity because of a sexual scandal, which indirectly lead him to suicide. That a man who saved people, who should be seen as a benefactor of humanity, had his legacy ignored for years made me realize two things: math are too abstract and people believe what they see, virtually, Turning saved people but no one could materialize it, to measure up the glory of his work.There's a magnificent moment where the code is broken and when his friend is ready to jump at a phone and prevent a ship bombing, Turing stops him. If they change the course of the war right now, Nazis will immediately cancel Enigma and annihilate their years of research. That's a subtlety that is extremely hard to accept, sacrificing thousands of people, to save millions, or to shorten the war, one could say that Turing let British people die, but maybe this act itself has saved millions others. But human intelligence is too blind to see it, what a tragic irony that the man who saved millions of people with artificial intelligence was sacrificed on the altar of human stupidity.But the film at least respect our intelligence and says a lot without words, two standout moments I got at the first viewing: Alan tells Joan about the machine's name, Christopher, something is odd and she doesn't mention it, and yes, it took me a few seconds to realize that I expected a woman's name. And that was a brilliant hint of Alan's homosexuality before the revelation. A second moment is when he's in London train station with Joan and mothers and soldiers stare at him with disdain, he's obviously seen like a coward. How ironic that they'll never know this man is as heroic as them.""The Imitation Game"" is an imperfect film but from the subject it handles and its importance, it is as highly recommendable as if it was a masterpiece."

But what worked well in old film has not succeeded here in anew one. My opinion - while that old one was a perfect mix of suspense, thriller, drama, war epic, tragedy and romance, here it is a bleak dull shaggy description of some ill and variously challenged man with a good mind. But it all falls flat with a painfully slow delivery, unpersuasive tonality, certain flaws and goofs and a very silly air of pathetic motto: Who, if not us. OK, they did a marvelous job, but some aspects of war were so mundane and boring that they do not deserve a film to show. Do we really need to see a highly unwell man breaking codes or very blatantly Oliver Stone style of interpolation being stolen? No, certainly not. What is also very obvious and painfully poor is that rainbow scheme flag agenda propaganda slyly creeping into a plot, delivering a certain ungodly message. Okay, we can watch this once and quickly dismiss"
" The Incredible Machine
",0.0,0.9895,2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Cracking the Nazi Enigma machine takes a toll on mathematician Alan Turing in this biographical drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Far from a traditional biopic, the film transitions between Turing's childhood, his World War II days and the 1950s in which he was investigated on charges of homosexuality (a crime in the UK at the time). Some of the transitions are a little jarring, but in general, the film flows well, giving quite an insight into the way Turing's arguably autistic mind worked. One of the best elements of the film is how Turing's code cracking days help the socially awkward man learn how to function in the world, discovering that if he is nice to others, they will want to assist him and so forth. There is something quite sad to his tale; not just because he was persecuted for being gay and never recognised as a war hero, but because his social awkwardness was never properly treated. This is, however, ultimately an inspiring and uplifting tale, with Cumberbatch's boyish excitement when he realises that he has finally figured how to crack the code coming off just as intense as his sadder moments. Alexandre Desplat's score with sounds similar to computer dings is a nice touch too, and while the script may take some historical liberties, it nevertheless provides a fascinating look at the success of a social misfit and the society that refused to accept him."
" Cumberbatch shines in ""The Imitation Game""
",0.0,0.9988,2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Can machines think? This is the main question posed in ""Computer Machinery and Intelligence,"" a 1950s paper published by Alan Turing. The paper's concepts surfaced in his single-handed design and construction of a machine that broke the German Enigma codes during World War IIor so the film says. While the historical accuracy of ""The Imitation Game"" comes into question on several occasions, the outstanding quality of the film's acting, direction and story is no enigma. The movie focuses on the life of Alan Turing, a British mathematician, computer scientist and cryptanalyst. The British Intelligence recruits Turing along with other cryptographic minds to crack the Enigma codes that the Nazis use as secret communication during the war. The film's narrative alternates between three significant times in Turing's life: his education at Sherborne School as a teenager, his classified work with Enigma during the war and the investigation surrounding Turing's sexual orientation in 1952. The settings of the Enigma machines change daily as the war progresses. The small group of cryptographers has 18 hours each day to figure out the settings of the machines before the Germans alter the settings the next day. This is a virtually impossible task for the team to accomplish because of the infinite number of possible settings the machine possesses, causing progressive frustration amongst the team. Turing's initial rudeness, apparent social detachment and unwillingness to work with the rest of the team only add to the growing tension. Turing conceives, designs and begins to build a machine that he believes will be able to mull through the numerous Enigma settings possibilities at a considerably fast rate. A machine like this has never been built, much less proved to work. His endeavor brings about much skepticism and agitation from the team. Over time however, especially after the acquisition of Joan Clarke (Keira Knightly) to the team, Turing begins to treat his colleagues with respect and gains their trust.To say that Benedict Cumberbatch had an amazing performance at this point in his career is the equivalent of saying the sky is blue, and it remains blue yet again as Cumberbatch knocks it out of the park. Turing as shown in the film is extremely intelligent but lacks normal social skills. He is not the most likable guy; he has trouble interacting with others, takes everything that is said to him literally and has a sense of arrogance that puts others off. However, there is also warmth about his character and he genuinely desires to be liked by others. Cumberbatch expresses both aspects of this persona beautifully. The supporting cast is equally fantastic. Those who play the members of Turing's team (Matthew Goode, Allen Leach, Matthew Beard and Keira Knightly) have great chemistry with each other and Cumberbatch. Alex Lawther as the young Alan Turing mimics Cumberbatch's portrayal well, and viewers will truly believe the struggles he endures from being different than everyone else. Graham Moore took home an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work on the film, and it's not hard to see why. The well-written script is the fuel for the gripping, emotional drama exhibited in the actors' performances.Morten Tyldum's direction is not to be ignored either. The interchange between the various time periods in Turing's life are done smoothly, and the non-linear story telling is carried out excellently. The writing, directing and acting present Turing's struggle well as a homosexual in the 1950s and the punishment that he had to endure because of it. While both aspects of the production are good from a narrative standpoint, the direction and the writing is also where the main issue of the movie lies.In ""The Imitation Game,"" viewers are led to believe that Turing built the machine that cracked Enigma and conceived its design virtually by himself. In reality however, the Polish Intelligence gave a primitive version of the machine to the Government Code and Cypher School in 1939, and Turing was hired to make improvements on the machine based on his knowledge of computers. Also, unlike the movie portrays; Turing was actually well liked by his colleagues and was placed as the head of the operation until 1942. This is one of several factual errors present in ""The Imitation Game"" that range from Turing giving his machine a name, to John Cairncross being a cryptanalyst and a somewhat influential character in the story. Despite these historical inaccuracies, the movie has received widespread critical acclaim. In addition to winning the Best Adapted Screenplay award, it also received nine Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor.""The Imitation Game"" is a riveting drama with stellar performances, excellent writing and solid direction. Among the better films of 2014, it remains a must-see for 2015."
" Great Story About WWII and the War One Man Battled With Himself
",-0.25,0.974,2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"The Imitation Game is a dramatic movie with a slight touch of suspense based on Alan Turing's experience well working for the British Government Communication Headquarters. Ultimately Turing is able to help break the code for the Enigma machines that the Germans were using to send encrypted messages during war time. The movie starts with the present day of Alan's life, a break in at Alan's house and how Alan reacts to the officers and the way he responds to others being in his house is alarming to the police that are trying to get information for their investigation. This sparks officers to look into Alan's background. The film then transitions to 1939 when Alan is interviewing for the British Government Communication. This point of the movie we get see the characterization of the key roles in this film. Something that sticks out about Alan is that he a very literal person. We see how socially awkward Alan is when he interacts with a group. At this point the film continues with the non-linear format and flashes back to when Alan was is in grade school. This sets up another character of the film. Christopher, Christopher is Alan's school friend that Alan states is the reason he was able to get through school and who introduced him to cryptic messages. Because this film his based on actual events that occurred and on parts of Alan's life the story is very credible. The film does a fantastic job of showing what life was like living Britain during WWII. All of the clothing and scenery is very dull. Not too many colors and the town's people seem to have come to term with bombings that happen quite often. In one scene the alarm for the citizens to take cover goes off. The camera shows the plane flying over the very dark city and then shows a families calmly but steadily to the bomb shelters. As the bombs were hitting, the scene shows some of the celling falling in the shelter but no one reacts. The screen then transitions to the morning after showing all the destruction that has been caused. This sets the mood to show the pressure that Alan his under help solve Enigmas encrypted messages. I found it interesting that the only other person that Alan truly let see him for who he was Joan. I think Alan was able to relate to Joan because he understood some of what she went through being different. Woman during that time were not allowed to work certain jobs because they were viewed as not being able to have to same brain capacity as men. Joan was a woman who could solve math problems and crossword puzzles faster than Alan. This was unheard of and men never gave her chance, so Alan did. Alan tells Joan the same words that Christopher said to him when he was unsure of himself. ""Sometimes it is the people no one images anything of who do the things that no one can imagine."" At the time Alan does not tell her it was Christopher that told him the very same words but Joan learns to trust Alan and is thankful for what he has done for her. Joan character develops into someone that is strong and sure of herself that no longer has to rely on Alan to protect her. She actually tries to protect Alan later in the movie when the allegations come out that he is gay. She is scared for Alan and is willing to commit perjury to save him from the government sanctioned laws against gay men. The two points of climax for me was when the commanding officer finally has enough Alan's attitude and takes his personal feelings out on Alan by getting back at him professionally and bring a team to unplug the machine. Alan his able to convince the commander to give him another month which heightens the suspense and anxiety of the audience. We want to see Alan win, he has been through so much and believes in this machine so much. Plus the machine is a extension of Christopher for Alan so it has to work. The second conflict when the officers find out that what Alan was hiding that he is a homosexual. The officer knows that Alan his a war hero and does not want to pursue with the charges but at this point it is out of his hands. The charges are eventually filed on Alan. Alan's internal conflicts eventually win over him. Alan knew he was different when he was younger and tried his best to hide that he is gay. Because of this he does not even want to admit that he was friends with Christopher when the school official tells him that Christopher has died. The very thing that Alan worked so hard to hide and keep to himself is the thing that ultimately ends up ruining the man he was."
" Embrace Enigmas
",0.3182,0.8432,2017-03-19 00:00:00,9,"The Imitation Game (2014) seamlessly ties together three story sequences from different times in the life of brilliant mathematician Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Most of the film's screen time is dedicated to wartime when Turing and his team, hired by British government, are working diligently to crack the Nazi code, Enigma. Turing has a brilliant obsession to create Christopher, a machine sure to break Enigma. Turing's teammates, including initial team-leader Hugh (Matthew Goode), find Turing's personality to be quite intolerable, which leads to tension and disconnect amongst the members. Turing's only female recruit, Joan (Keira Knightley), understands and appreciates his quirks and genius, and helps build bridges between Turing and the rest of the men. When tensions arise and suspicions of a spy surface, the group finally comes together to use Christopher to break the code, and use their newly gained knowledge to make war-winning decisions. Throughout this storyline, seamless transitions are used to take us back in time to Turing as a young school boy, developing feelings for his classmate, Christopher, and learn how and why he became the master code-breaker we see during the war. We also are moved forward in time to post-war life for Turing, when, after reporting a break- in, Detective Nock (Rory Kinnear) pursues an investigation of Turing which has devastating long-term effects on his life. Accepting enigmas seems to be an underlying theme of the film, whether the enigma is a machine, situation, or person. Turing himself is an enigma to others; he is uncomfortably antisocial, often seeming self-righteous, and no one understood him or expected his machine to work. This is supported by dialogue, one quote in particular which is repeated three times throughout the film: ""Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine."" Christopher said this to young Turing, Turing to Joan, then Joan again to Turing later. The structure of the storyline is also somewhat of an enigma, as it begins in medias res, and the viewer is forced to pay attention to follow the back-and-forth of times, though superb editing makes this easy to do. One such smooth transitions, is a wipe with the left to right transition of a bomb flying across the screen which turns into a cigarette getting put out against a wall in a different time and place. Once the pieces of the plot ""enigma"" are put together in the end, it falls into place for the viewer to understand, similar to Christopher Nolan's The Prestige (2006). After seeing the film, you might walk away with a stronger conviction to accept people for who they are and to embrace a challenge, no matter how confusing they may seem in the beginning."
" Benedict Cumberbatch Offers A Brilliant Portrayal Of A Troubled And Tormented Man
",0.2023,-0.9938,2017-03-14 00:00:00,7,"Benedict Cumberbatch was absolutely superb in this biopic as Alan Turing. Turing was a bona fide war hero - a status achieved not on the battle field, but at home. A mathematical genius, Turing was part of a team that managed to decrypt the coded messages the Germans sent using their ""Enigma"" machine, primarily through the use of his so-called ""Turing machine"" - which was basically an early, primitive computer. Some have referred to Turing as the father of modern computer science. His hero status aside, however, Turing was a troubled and tormented man. He was socially awkward, isolated, and largely friendless. Although the word is never used in the movie, it seems clear that by modern standards, he was probably autistic. Adding to his torment was the fact that he was also gay in a society that was actively hostile to homosexuals, and in which homosexuality was illegal. I thought Cumberbatch captured the complexities of the man brilliantly.Essentially the movie is presented as a flashback. Turing's homosexuality was discovered several years after the war's end, and the story of his past is told as he's interviewed by a detective. Most of the film is set in Bletchley Park, where the work on Enigma was conducted, and revolves around his troubled relationships with his co-workers on the project, including Joan (played by Keira Knightley) - the one true friend he made, and to whom he was briefly engaged. At times, the flashbacks go back further to his time as a student at a boarding school where he develops the other great friendship of his life - with fellow student Christopher Morcom, who tragically dies of tuberculosis, an event which surely traumatized Turing greatly.The movie follows Turing's life up until its end in 1954 at the tragically young age of 41. The film accepts the official determination that he committed suicide by cyanide poisoning. Having been discovered to be homosexual, he had been given the choice of prison or ""chemical castration"" - basically being forced to take estrogen in order to weaken his libido. The movie shows him being despondent and physically shattered by the treatments, leading to his suicide. That thesis isn't universally accepted, though. Some have pointed out that the hormone treatments had ended a year before his death, and that Turing had made some very definite plans for his future work, and he had been engaged in some experiments that could have led to accidental cyanide poisoning. There is even the inevitable conspiracy theory, suggesting that Turing was murdered by British security forces. However, the official verdict is suicide, and none of the other theories was explored or even mentioned. In the end, the film becomes a critique - and an appropriate one - of the decision of previous generations to criminalize homosexuality, noting the thousands of men who had been convicted under the old laws. Finally, in 2013, Turing was posthumously pardoned, and laws have allowed the pardons of several thousand other men similarly convicted.There are some historical points in the movie with which one can quibble, but to do so misses the point that the movie wasn't really about the history of the events (although they are reasonably if imperfectly portrayed) but was instead about Turing's complex and tragic life. Cumberbatch brought the man to life brilliantly, and the writers managed to give us a fascinating glimpse into his mind. It's not an especially exciting movie, but it is a good study of a man who deserves to be better known than he is, since Turing's work on Enigma was kept secret for many years after the end of the war.

" Very well told true story
",0.6659,0.9046,2017-03-13 00:00:00,10,"The Imitation Game is a great movie that is based off of true, real life events during WWII. The performances are magnificent! Cumberbatch and Knightly are wonderful in their portrayals of these historical people. Benedict Cumberbatch is a fine, skilled actor and this Oscar nominated performance showcases that, it puts his raw talent up on display for all to see. The same goes for Keira Knightly, she is a a very talented actress, anyone who has seen her movies knows that for damn sure. The sets, the costume design, and how everything is constructed makes for a near perfect representation of WWII times in Britain. The script is also very well written and it showcases both the historical events that occurred and the backgrounds and personal horror the individual people go through. The main one I'm of course talking about is Cumberbatch's character Alan Turing. Turing endured many many down right atrocities and horrific treatment in his lifetime. He was gay and had to keep it a secret since it was illegal and you'd get in very big trouble if you were found out to be LGBTQ. They made him undergo cruel physical treatment to ""change"" him, which is extremely sad and tragic to see. But I'm so glad to see that the filmmakers accurately portrayed this and had facts about the inhumane, dehumanizing treatment of homosexuals during that time in history. All in all, this is a wonderfully made film that I recommend to everyone."
" A story that needed to be told, told in a way that is too Hollywood
",0.0,-0.4548,2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"There is a formulaic quality in the way the movie was done that overshadowed the good acting and the important story of Turing's life. Much of the situations that had Cumberbatch's character as a focal point in the film were rarely so in real life and many were completely fabricated. I understand how telling the story of an autistic gay mathematician in a manner that would make people want to see it was not an easy job, but as such much of the movie felt cheap.Turing is credited for inventing the modern concept of computers, although, as the movie itself shows, his design for the machine that broke the Enigma code was not only based on a Polish design, but was a collaborative work with a person that isn't even mentioned in the film. The situation of him being treated the way he was because he was gay and the ridiculous way the British government refused to acknowledge they did anything wrong for half a decade is only briefly mentioned in a screen text at the end.Bottom line: if you know nothing of Turing and wish to watch a populist retelling of his story, so watch The Imitation Game. It is not a bad movie at all. However, if you are interested in the actual person, search for other sources of information.Personally, I am tired of this style of film in which an arrogant but brilliant ass of a person gets vindicated only because at the end he is proved right in one situation or another."
" Completely Brilliant
",0.624,-0.3299,2017-03-09 00:00:00,10,"Despite the few historical inaccuracies, this film is absolutely splendid. Mostly the little things that were historically inaccurate are there only to further along the plot in a cinema-friendly way for audiences who will be largely unfamiliar with the story. From the start, a viewer might think that they were watching another episode of Sherlock, since Mr. Cumberbatch is essentially just playing another socially awkward genius. But very quickly his performance separates itself from Sherlock entirely, and you see a very different sort of man, full of tragedy and longing as much as intelligence. His performance was exceptional and this film is vastly underrated. Keira Knightley demonstrated beautifully that she has grown as an actress since her Pirates days, and she was a great compliment to Cumberbatch's character. Some of the scenes that depict bomb dropping were created in a way that seemed out of place with the film, they were strangely animated. The last 20 minutes of the film will have anyone with a soul weeping. Written and directed wonderfully,what someone might have considered a boring premise (a war movie about math, or a math movie about war?) takes on a life as though the viewer were living it. This deserves a place among any classic."
" This is the classic that we should never ignore permanently!

This movie takes place during World War II to deal with Hitler's invention Enigma. Turing decides to decode Hitler's secrets and makes sure the secrets get revealed before it gets too late.I'm sorry that Alan is having a gay life and his relationship with Joan was never successful, unfortunately.We should never ignore watching this movie because this is permanently education for the rest of its life here on planet earth!"
" Amazing story and character, OK movie
",0.7739,0.9967,2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"The Imitation Game tells an amazing story about an amazing man, the British scientist Alan Turin, one of the fathers of computer science. Overall, the film is very enjoyable and has, a priori, everything to succeed -- great actors, an interesting story, and a fascinating historical period. However, the production, direction, and script ruined it for me. I find surprising that the script won an Oscar, really unbelievable. The main flaw of the movie is the lack of focus. The historical episode and Turin himself are fascinating subjects. If you want to produce a two-hour movie, you have to choose what you focus on; otherwise, you'll get a movie that is flawed because is all over the place, like a scattered brain. That is, you focus on Turin the man and the scientist and tell his story from childhood to death and all his scientific breakthroughs, or you focus solely on the cracking of the Enigma code. The movie tries to do both things and fails, produces a clichéd and somewhat contrived version of Turin, and the cracking-the-code episode lacks dramatic tempo because the time to build it was used to tell general facts about Turin. I found the double flashback in the movie, really interesting narratively, but it doesn't help much to create an image of Turin that honors the multifaceted person and scientist he was. As a viewer, the film failed to move me and to engage me fully. The second flaw of the movie is the acting. Don't take me wrong, I think most of the actors do a good job with the material they are given, but only one of them fully shines: Alex Lawther as the young Turin, who is truly superb and believable 100% and he wasn't nominated for any Oscar! Having Cumberbatch and Knightly together in a movie is a real treat, but is their acting in this movie really great? The answer is No. Is their acting better than other performances of theirs in movies for which they weren't nominated to an Oscar? The answer is No!The third flaw of the film is the atmosphere. Not bad at all, but not good either, and full of cinematic clichés and scenes that were deja vu.It felt more for a TV mini-series than for a film. Overall, an enjoyable film with an intriguing character, a great performance by Lawther, but way overrated."
" Not enough science
",0.0,0.9844,2017-02-04 00:00:00,6,"This is a good flick. But if you are like me you started skipping the interpersonal stuff about halfway through. It would have been such a better flick if the gay agenda wasn't being pushed so hard. Okay, he was a sweet kid who fell in love with an older student. I can't help but wonder how he would have turned out in a school that wasn't all- boys. Some nice young girl might have taken him under her wing, and the rest of his life wouldn't have needed to be hidden. In either case, the interpersonal stuff was just in the way.Much more about the reasoning involved and the particulars of the development of his 'machine' would have made this so much better a motivating movie."
" Another hollywoodized biography movie...
",0.0,0.9939,2017-01-23 00:00:00,1,"It's becoming annoying that movies nowadays are based so much on the artistic part rather than delivering a message and telling a compelling story to the audiences so that after you watch the movie you'll say ""it was worth it!"". This movie is no exception from what I wrote above, here's why:The Science: In a movie about the invention of the first computer, you have to be scientifically authentic and I mean to use scientific terms or at least try to explain to the audiences what the hell is Enigma? In this movie Enigma is as enigmatic as the tesseract in MCU... The only moment when there's actually a hint of science is the scene between Alan and Joan where Alan tries to explain enigma to her but that scene makes Alan look like an idiot.. I mean a guy who knows so much about decrypting codes should sound like a guy trying to speak on understandable terms even though he might struggle with that due to the fact that he knows so many scientific things... Benedict tries so hard and I appreciate his effort but the writers are to blame here for a lame and hollywoodized script.The story. I don't know the actual historical facts but the way the characters are presented to us make them unbearable and way too clichéd. I couldn't care less for Alan who's story was just used only to gave the actor playing him a great performance in order to win the Oscar. The scene at the end where he is shown to have hormonal problems is supposed to make us care for him? Why didn't they developed that early in the movie so that his character had a reason for being this way. Remember when biography movies told us from the beginning that the main character had a problem that made us care for him and even start the plot (see King's Speech) , while here the protagonist's problem is thrown in the movie at the end like ""Hey! Here's Alan's problem and you should care for him!"" disgusting... There are tons of examples of great performances within movies that have great story and make you care for the characters and for what happens in the story. Take for example Colin Firth's performance in the King's Speech. That movie actually had a compelling story that made you care for the main character's problem, while here is just a display of Benedict's and Kera's acting. This movie's story has so many clichés, even more than Spider-man 3 I should say and here are some examples: A girl is ridiculously smart and finishes the test so fast it just points to her BING! There's the hot smart girl in this movie. The only way to make her more clichéd I guess was to write a note on her forehead saying ""This is the hot and clever chick in this movie and she'll have a relationship with the main protagonist!"" Anyway moving on... Alan is being bullied like a high school kid for being to clever, this is worse than Tobey's Peter in Spider-man(at least that movie had a compelling story and a fantastic heart to it)... I could go on like this but there's a word limit.The music: Bland and typical Alexandre Dumas... although his score for Godzilla was way more epic and inspiring than this garbage which by the way gets nominated for Oscar, while the other score doesn't even gets nominated for an Oscar. Surprise? Just another soundtrack made to please the Oscars. There are tons of great soundtracks that didn't get nominated for Oscar and are way better than this sh*t. This just shows that not everything that is nominated for Oscars means is the best there is out there. This movie is again, no exception.To sum up my review: This is a typically Hollywood ""trying to impress and win Oscars"" movie that has no heart and no clever or intriguing plot. I rated this movie with 1, since it can't be compared with biography masterpieces like The King's Speech for example or Rush. This movie's real rating should be around 6-7 probably more towards 7, but with IMDb's rating system and with all the so called ""critics"" here, this movie's rating inflated to 8.1, which is even higher than The King's Speech."

Turing job interview scene was hilarious. How intelligence system works, and Turing's ability to manipulate his boss. The portrayal of spy games and spy masters was compelling. What did not work: Turing was bright and right about issues, but lacked social graces. The viewer could see why Truing's co-workers and boss hated Turing. The declassification of knowing the German cold and the harsh decisions left the viewer cold. The Imitation Game okay, but hard to watch. Six out of ten stars."

Important events such as the first Bomba's developed in 1938 by Polish Cipher Bureau cryptologist Marian Rejewski and colleagues Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki were ignored, as were the contributions of the vast staff of Bletchley Park and related organizations.Turing's role was formidable, but only part of the secret intelligence war that produced 'Ultra'. This is not a war history film, it is an oversimplified biography of Turing, a much more complex individual than the one depicted by actor Benedict Cumberbatch. Nonetheless, Cumberbatch did a very credible performance despite the limitations of his script."

The police send a man to follow Turing into a pub, where he hands an envelope to a male prostitute, who is arrested shortly afterward and confesses that Turing is a client. Staehl is ready to charge Turing with gross indecency, but Nock is still convinced that Turing is a spy, and begs Staehl to let him interrogate Turing for half an hour, whereupon the latter begins to disclose his top-secret activities during the war.In 1939, after Britain declares war on Germany, Turing is accepted by Commander Alastair Denniston, of the Royal Navy, for a code-breaking job at Bletchley Park, working alongside Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards.

" So inaccurate it's embarrassing, 1st review I've ever bothered to do.
",-0.6326,-0.9897,2017-01-14 00:00:00,3,"Yes I joined IMDb just to say - please don't think this film is in any way accurate. Secondly - please don't watch it for fun! The invention of the world's first super computer should not go down like this. I also cringe to think of people discussing the war with what they learned in this film. I don't think it's even a stand alone good romance / historical fiction either. The boiled down plot is very childish, makes little sense as it dawdles emotionally along. Ahem - there was a wee war on? Where's the flight / fight that would be in effect...***************************SPOILER ALERT******************************If you want to know anything about the real story please watch the English documentary Codebreakers, containing actual mathematical techniques used in cracking codes.The movie lacks any actual maths or cryptography at all. And the docu also shares more info about Turin and Flower's futures after the war which I found fascinating. I won't spoil that for you! Seriously cool men did all this, not just one guy.Cumberpatch is one of my fave actors too. Very disappointed he got involved in such a ruination of two of the most important historical stories of the 20th C. It's not often that real life is so much more interesting that a film! The acting is solid, although hugely similar to most of his other stock performances, so no new angle except for his sad eye moments... bit of an eek addition to his portfolio. Victimy without having much charisma. From what I understand in real life, Turin was really quite dapper, they weren't having a popularity contest down at Bletchley park because, ...there was a WAR going on! Being gay / bullied / unpopular not as important as saving your country! Of course IRL he got in trouble after people found out he was gay. It was the 40s. And there was no mention in real life of fully incompetent superiors, this is just thrown in for extra bullying effect I guess!Also he words that they say in the movie helped them to crack enigma are fully bogus and never appeared in the real transmissions. Not in code. It wasn't even enigma !?! it was a machine Hitler called TULLY. Enigma was broken 10 years prior by the Polish! There were no woman on the crack team of maths heads who of course had no say in what info was later shared. So much unimaginative fantasy. Really could be the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. I quite like Keira also.NOTE TO CREW: don't go making movies about something super important that the allies can be so proud of and then mix it up with Alice in Wonderland and a 12 year old's expose on bullying please.Also there is also a heavy touch of... ''straights won't be able to sympathise with gay people unless they've been bullied severely'' in it. Very unnecessary.Please believe I'm not a continuity geek really, this was just so bad as well as historically inaccurate. I was so looking forwards to it too. I left it playing in the sitting room I walked out before the last 15 minutes, after thinking how stoopid it was that the main (imaginary) woman in the story married a homosexual that had never kissed her, and 6 months later with some kind of straight face managed to look mildly surprised that he was not straight after he confessed to her. It would have made more sense if she had burst out laughing or cried. But no - I guess as an actor she had lost interest in the floundering plot at that point also. I did end up going back to and check what facts they shared with the audience at the end of the movie, just seemed to be the tragic gay only based facts really.Come on. I mean doesn't it even seem too ridiculous, the story line? A socially awkward mathematician with no military training being allowed to judge what info to share with his immediate superiors? Being made an honorary spy? If Britain had been this crap at intelligence the war would never have been won, honestly. This movie had the chance to put the yanks straight, that the British codebreaking won the war more for the allies than the American input at the end of the war. Hmm... these producers are American...Please watch Codebreakers the documentary, especially if you have an interest in problem solving. I didn't enjoy having to bring back the word Bogus. Pros: close ups of the machine (and woolly vests) were interesting. But the starring computer was not called what the movie called it : Christopher (too gay lol), but was really known as Colossus. I think the story of the invention of the world's first super computer / computer deserved a much more valiant effort, what lazy film making.I will be blacklisting this group of directors / screen writers from my future viewings as I really don't respect how they think, feel, or handle facts. Beware WEINSTEIN BROTHER's PRODUCTIONS! NOT WORTH viewing."
