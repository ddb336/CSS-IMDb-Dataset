" Quite moving story of the difficulty of achieving a quality relationship.
",-0.34,0.7702,2021-03-21 00:00:00,8,"It's a sad reflection on the dumbing down of America that reviewers here just don't get it. Good actors can play any role. Just because some actors are known for their comedic parts doesn't mean they can't do dramatic roles too. Reviewers whinging here they didn't get a comedy should send alarm signals about America's education system. Dumb.
There is nothing much to complain about with this film. It's a realistic portrayal of the potential disintegration of a marriage when circumstances present a mirror of their true characters.
I'd recommend this for its realism and heart. Julia and Will perform brilliantly and you will be making judgements until the ironic (and yes, for the comedy lovers, wickedly hilarious) end. I really enjoyed it."
" Moralized reactions under a microscope
",0.0,0.9048,2021-02-21 00:00:00,9,This film makes a strong case for self reflection and was very successful in reaching this viewer on that level. It raises a string of questions based on hypotheticals and takes its time easing off the pointedness. This is emotionally and intellectually intriguing and certainly bets on women to have your back when things get tough.The discussions the characters have allow the bigger question of why people react differently to breathe and different ensures explored. The audience may be smaller than an avalanche blockbuster might suggest but do your research and give this gem a chance.Highly recommended
" THE COMEDY IS SO FRICKIN DARK.
",0.3612,0.8413,2021-02-11 00:00:00,9,"A slow-burn relationship drama that just explodes with brutal honesty and awkward tension. The comedy is so frickin dark and I love it. This film is definitely very thought-provoking and worthy of analysis, so simple yet crucially fundamental."
" Terrible

" Black comedy cum disaster film?
",-0.3818,-0.126,2021-01-08 00:00:00,8,"What a strange film.It basically flirts between a disaster film in its publicity and actually challenges relationship perceptions in a family dynamic when you watch it.The Towering Inferno it ain't!The story is basically of a Swedish family (think Alan Partridge, Benny from Abba) holidaying in some posh French ski resort.On the first day the family are all luvvy duvvy. On the second an incident occurs that changes the family dynamic for the rest of the holiday.An avalanche in a mountain top restaurant.
The film drags on as the mother moans that the husband legged it from his family.
At the end the husband redeems himself and the tables are actually turned.Great cinematography of the alpine scenery."
" Dissapointed
",0.0,-0.6438,2020-11-09 00:00:00,6,"I made the mistake of watching the Will Ferrell , American remake of Force Majeure (Downhill) before I saw the original and now I'm totally confused as to which I like best - Or should I say least ?In the Hollywood version they didn't make the characters half as annoying as in this .
I really disliked the wife , Ebba. A thoroughly nasty piece of work who just loved humiliating her husband in front of friends because he made a mistake in running away from an avalanche instead of protecting his family .The whole film revolves around that one incident and you can't help but think that , yes he should have reacted differently, but why ruin a holiday over it ?After a while , instead of cringing , which I think was meant to be the viewers reaction , I just got angry and wished the husband would grow some balls and tell her how horrible she was being .Getting back to which film is best . Unusually for me I think Downhill just shaded it , but I also think if I'd have seen this first , my choice might have been different , if that makes any sense ? .Overall I was expecting much more this and all it really did was wind me up ."
" Anxiety inducing brilliance

This was followed by panic and cursing the stupidity and arrogance of the father on the foggy slopes and then more anxiety on the bus ride home.....this is why i will never go skiing, i'll stick to birdwatching as my hobby."
" If Parasite can win the best pic Oscar...
",0.8402,0.9724,2020-08-13 00:00:00,8,"I've not actually seen 12 Years A Slave so cannot compare it to Force Majeure but it must be some film to have trumped the latter.Thematically I found FM an identifiable precursor to Parasite, the tone, minimal editing (aside from the hilarious alpha-male nightclub scene) and in depth examination of the shadow-self.Fore Majeure is brilliant. Tragic and hilarious, so many nuggets of really intelligent film making. It's a highly intelligent film, with subtitles, so I can appreciate that it won't have universal appeal."
" Catches you with its thrilling moments, then forgets the direction and leaves you
",0.4767,0.8332,2020-08-04 00:00:00,6,"Nicely enters and develops the story. Gives you all disturbing feelings and emotions successfully. And after that point, you keep sharing the tension and conflicts of the characters.
With its realistic, depressing scenery, details and effects, the movie forces you to expect something bigger, something shocking or disturbing.
However, the last part of the movie leaves you on the mountain, and goes to another direction to support its idea. And this makes you to feel unsatisfied while still feeling tense.
Nice movie about the roles of men/women. You surely question yourself. A little slow but makes you watch.
Definitely not a comedy movie. I wonder who classifies it like this. :)"
" Should have been a TV episode
",0.0,0.7635,2020-07-04 00:00:00,5,Two hours seems like an eternity in this self important and quite frankly boring film. The core idea is good but the character development and lack of seemingly anything happening makes it deeply flawed. Worth watching but not at all remembering trust me.

And not in the 80s John Carpenter (as an example) style of making a comedy+horror+action+drama(!) since those would just jump from one style to the other (some times successfully, others, not so much). Force Majeure doesn't jump, it has its own style throughout. However, it is you, the viewer, that is changing and reacting differently to it."

" Very accomplished drama about masculinity and family
",0.4927,0.899,2020-02-19 00:00:00,7,"I can't fault the writing, the acting or the piece as a whole in any way really.The dynamics and relationships between all the characters, especially of the central family, were done very convincingly. This did feel like a real family and the individuals behaved believably (even the young children).I felt that the main ""subject"" of the film was masculinity. The way in which Tomas handles the position he finds himself in; and the way Tomas and his friend Mats try to exorcise his feelings.I could relate to Tomas, also being a father with two young kids, and that probably helped me to ""get into"" the film. I do wander how much I'd have got out of it had I been (for example) a 25 year old bachelor."
" BORING
",-0.3182,0.5729,2020-02-16 00:00:00,1,I dont know how this is rated so high by others. There was only one funny part. Maybe the French and other foreign countries have a different kind of humor than the US.
" Super Toxic
",0.5994,-0.0516,2020-02-16 00:00:00,2,Devoid of entertainment or enlightenment. Just 2 hours of relationships decompensating at a posh ski resort after an incident that leaves the characters questioning their lives. Off putting and depressing art house drivel.
" How did they waste this concept?
",-0.4215,0.2424,2020-01-21 00:00:00,5,"On paper this movie should be hilarious... sadly the writer and director makes some absolutely bizarre choices that severely squandered a great premise. The most egregious choice is that nearly every single shot is a static wide shot that lasts at least 30 seconds if not more (some shots of literal blackness or white out). I think I counted only 4 shots where the camera moved at all with only a handful more shots of close ups on the actors. What this does is create an incredibly harsh, impersonal, lifeless atmosphere that is only worsened by a very understated script. Why the director chose to shoot the movie this way? Who knows, but to me it came across as lazy rather than artistic or stylized. What's worse, is these incredibly lingering, flat shots were of the most mundane activities. It felt a bit like they had an hour of actual story and had to fill the rest of the time with coverage of whatever their actors were doing between takes. At first I thought it was just a slow burn movie (which I'm a big fan of), that was building up the tension and anticipation for a big climactic ending, but no, it just sort of ends. The movie made me chuckle maybe 3 or 4 times but it was mostly because I was relieved that SOMETHING was happening, not because what happened was genuinely funny. This is my first Swedish language film so perhaps this is typical of their sense of humor and I just don't get it, but for my American sensibilities, I found it to be a MAJEURE let down."
" Nothing ""wickedly funny"" in this movie
",0.0382,-0.8849,2020-01-14 00:00:00,2,"I found this movie to be incredibly sad and depressing. A weak narcissistic father and husband shows his true colors when he runs away from his family during an avalanche instead of protecting them, then denies it. His wife and kids resent him for this and feel like they were abandoned, and they were."
" Slow paced, spectacular
",0.0,0.9531,2019-12-30 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this slow paced film in which the main themes seemed to be masculinity and the points of conflict which arise from the different roles and characters we all inhabit.The film concerns a seemingly perfect nuclear family going on a skiing holiday. The family witnesses a large avalanche, and they experience an acute moment of fear for their lives. The automatic response of the father in that moment creates an emotional avalanche that is the driving force for the remainder of the film.It was mostly quite a light film, with a good dose of humour, which nevertheless raised some interesting and thoughtful questions about society. The scenery was quite spectacular."

",0.0,-0.8587,2019-07-19 00:00:00,3,"This is a movie about a couple with some relationship problems. The whole movie is hinged up on discussions about a situation with an avalanche where the guy runs away from his girlfriend and their children. You can feel how the director of this movie hoped that you will feel the tension between this couple in various situations where they talk to eachother and others about the avalanche and other things.The problem is that its really hard to care at all about anyone in this movie. No one is very like-able or interesting. There is no tension, it just ends up feeling forced. The actors are not brilliant either - they are not terrible, just not good either. Take that and blend it with some superficial psychology mumble and you get ""Force majeure""."

" A great psychological study
",0.6249,0.7571,2019-04-22 00:00:00,8,"A Swedish couple ( Johannes Kuhnke and Lisa Loven Kongsli) are on a week's skiing vacation in the French Alps with their children. At the beginning of the trip, a frightening incident brings out the worst impulses in one of the family members. The remainder of the film is the fallout of this incident.Director Ruben Ostlund does a great job with a fine cast in displaying tension below and above the surface. The beginning is the proverbial ""dinosaur in the living room"" situation where everyone pretends that nothing happened while trying in vain to hide their feelings. When feelings can't be hidden any more, things get really interesting.Kuhnke and Kongsli are great in their roles especially Kuhnke during a major meltdown scene.""Force Majeure"" shows that we may never know what our true instincts are until a major event happens. The pivotal event at the film's beginning ripples into how it affects another couple who are informed of the situation and how one member's instincts are also brought to the surface.There were two events near the end of the film that might not have been necessary (or at least could have been shortened) though they still do add interesting information to the equation. The second last scene seems contrived at times; the last scene seemed to add unnecessary drama though a small crowd scene strongly shows the fate of two secondary characters.But these complaints don't stop ""Force Majeure"" from being one of the best movies of 2014."
" Struggling to find their 'inner Viking' maybe but who cares!
",0.5255,-0.1375,2019-03-20 00:00:00,7,"I was left somewhat open mouthed by the end of this and not in a good way. There must be something lost in translation of lost something lacking in my understanding of Scandinavians. Rather frustrating film that seems to want us to assess and then re-assess our perception of gender but because everyone is seemingly silly or even stupid most of the time (except when interminably brushing their teeth en famille) this is a fruitless and tedious exercise. Add to this the fact that the makers seem to reckon all this disfunction is 'funny' makes a full appreciation of this film very difficult. I will say it is well shot and when the slopes don't look disgustingly grey and awful they look pretty spectacular. I shall, however, be very wary of ski-slopes and Scandinavians in future. Struggling to find their 'inner Viking' maybe but who cares!"

It starts with a great hook but disintegrates into a tedious, pretentious story which leaves the viewer with little empathy for either of the main characters. The scene that everyone talks about is a mess; it is unclear what happens visually, yet the movie's entire debate hinges upon it. It seems to end about three or four times which clearly shows that the author doesn't really have a point. It does, however, demonstrate that this could have easily been a 45 minute movie and lead to the same result."
" A Quiet And Engaging Film
",0.34,0.6302,2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,"""Force Majeure"" is a quietly engaging film that explores what we expect of each other, and what we expect of ourselves. The film follows a Swedish family on a ski holiday at an elite resort in the French Alps. All is well until an avalanche races toward the family as they begin a leisurely lunch on a sunlit patio. The mother grabs her two children and ducks for cover, while the father clings to his cell phone and instinctively runs away. The avalanche passes without doing any physical harm, but the decision each parent made in the face of danger will challenge their marriage to its core. This film takes us inside the crumbling relationship over the next several days of the ski holiday, and captures the dynamic well. It's not a ski film in the traditional sense, but the mountain environment becomes a private world in which we begin to understand how individuals and relationships are shaped by decisions made deep in the subconscious.""Force Majeure"" is a multi-lingual Swedish film with English subtitles that spends most of its time quietly observing the family after the devastation of the avalanche. The production, photography, and audio are strong, and the acting is solid, but the film is burdened with a few distractions that pull away from the main story. ""Force Majeure"" is a small 2014 independent film that has already been optioned for a remake by Fox Searchlight. I can imagine the story could be told a bit more efficiently, but I doubt a major studio will be able to preserve the subtlety and intentional awkwardness of the original."
" Fair drama, definitely not a comedy
",0.4386,0.9472,2018-07-18 00:00:00,5,"If you come into watching Force Majeure expecting a comedy, even a dark or dramatic one, you'll be very disappointed. It's not that the humor is too serious or dark for somebody's taste, it's just that it is not present. It's a case of false marketing. Some scenes are terribly awkward, and terribly unpleasant, sure. But to laugh at these scenes or to find them amusing is to not have a grain of empathy, and the actors really evoke it as they give complete, subtle but powerful performances. It's not only about empathy, it's not about whether the characters deserve their predicaments, it's about the realistic possibility of the events of a movie happening in random lives. It's not Meet the Parents awkward, it's the it can happen to you life-changing awkward. Grounded. As for the drama part, yes, the movie delivers on interesting themes, raising important questions yet somehow answering them too much on the nose each time. The pacing is too slow and there are parts which seem like are there only because the director wanted to cram as much of his ideas in a single movie."
" Could've been named 'Abyss between us'

That terrifying moment left them alive but still had a major impact. That occasion brought to the surface everything that was left unsaid between the husband and wife. Originality of this movie lies in the clever combination of the setting and realistic portrait of emotions. Throughout the movie we see beautiful shots of Alps and their grandeur compared to human. Still, compared side by side, it looks like ""force majeure"" of nature is nothing compared to ""force grand"" of human emotions. Here we see that it is easier to control nature than oneself. This movie has some scenes which do break the flow, but it's important to recognize their true meaning. For example, there are several scenes where the couple brushes their teeth. Boring, isn't it? The point is that you can live with someone and do even the most private things together and still be separated. Force majeure or Tourist may have been named ""Abyss between us"".If you're tired of superficial storytelling without any meaning whatsoever with real life, you might want to check this one out."

There are also lots of random and unexplained events, but they were just playing out what happens on normal family holiday with no explanation or lead-up.

" A Psychological Winner
",0.5859,-0.9777,2018-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Force Majeure (Swedish: Turist) (2014) This was a film about snow, families, marriages. Mostly, though, about the survival instinct. A Swiss family takes a vacation in the French Alps. A workaholic father, an attentive and loving mother, a son and a daughter, brother and younger sister. Tomas, Ebba, Vera, Harry. Plus Ebba's girlfriend, who seems to relish a polygamous lifestyle, Charlotte. Mats, an old friend of Tomas's, and his young twenty year old lover, Fanny. Day One. Family together, skis, uneventful. Ends with Vivaldi. Day Two. Family skis in the morning. Lunch, it becomes Avalanche Day. When Tomas grabs his belongings, runs from the scene. Escaping the avalanche, which fortunately never makes impact. Away from his wife. Away from his children. Away from his son calling, ""Daddy!"". Ebba looks around; she has never experienced anything like this in her life; she is scared; she clutches her children, looking for her husband. Vanished. Laughing, he returns to the table a few minutes later, as if nothing were wrong in the world. That night, dinner with Charlotte and her current man. Tomas insists he did no such thing, he would never run away, of course not. Ebba, plainly shocked into speechlessness. More sharp Vivaldi Concerto No. 2 chords. Day Three. Ebba wants an alone day. She returns to have dinner with Tomas' friends, finally admitting out loud how depressed she is that Tomas denies fleeing from get and the kids. Expressed how afraid she was. Tomas says nothing, even after they watch the video he filmed, clearly showing him running away. Discussion regarding survival instincts. Fanni tells Mats that she feels he would probably react as Tomas had because of his personality. He understandable takes offense and things are different between them after that. Vivaldi. Day Four. Guys day. Mats & Tomas are skiing alone. Mats convinces Tomas to try scream therapy. Tomas feels better. He returns to the hotel but cannot find Ebba. He goes back out and finds himself at a rave party. Non Vivaldi screaming music with sharp chords. Screams more. Pivotal scene. Outside their room, as they're children eavesdrop and hug each other in consolation, Thomas cries out that he hates that bad part of him, that he also suffers. Hates his cowardice. Here cheated in games with the children. Confesses to cheating in past. Final Day. Very foggy day. Ebba is lost in the snow. Tomas tells the children to stay where they are, leaves them to search for his wife. Follows her voice, successfully carries her back to reunite his family. Film ends with another scene showing how we react in survival situations. A bus ride down a winding mountain with sharp turns and driver is obviously not very skilled. Ebba panics, demands to be let out. Overreacting? The bus full of tourists is panicking, screaming, rushing out. Mats very firmly tells everyone to leave in a logical manner, women and children first, otherwise people will get hurt. Success. Charlotte (who previously stated she loved risks) remains in the bus along with a handful of others. Would the purpose of this scene be to show that Ebba can also overreact in what she deems to be a survival instincts situation? Still, she stays with her children by her side. They walk down the mountain. Close curtain. Three things. From a psychological standpoint, I liked this film, its exploration of what we do in a fight or flee survival situation, its refusal to take a side. Secondly, I personally do not feel that Tomas redeemed himself by saving Ebba on the last day of their vacation. Though since Ebba does not seem to want a divorce, I can see why she convinced herself that he did. Thirdly, weird music, sharp Vivaldi that serves as an interlude between days, maybe as foreshadowing to danger, was not to my liking. Other scenes of whiteness and snow and emptiness played well into overall message in film. For this film, the typical Scandinavian somber tone is apposite. Great camera work, 
Simple premise plays out well.

" Powerful Marriage Drama
",0.4215,0.9951,2018-01-30 00:00:00,9,"Force Majeure is a stunning 2014 drama by Swedish director Ruben Östlund (who did Involuntary and more recently the Academy Award nominated The Square) about a family of four spending a vacation at a resort in the French Alps. The husband Tomas, his wife Ebba, and their young son and daughter are, in the first day-and-a-half or so of the trip, by all appearances quite happy and having a good time in their stay, skiing down the beautiful slopes, having their pictures taken, laughing and so on. Then suddenly something changes everything: an avalanche, done through a controlled ignition, that strays further than intended towards where the four eating, and causes quite a fright among the diners, though as it turns out no one was ever put in any mortal risk. Ebba stays by her kids, while Tomas reacts I think the way many would in the heat of the moment. The next three-and-a-half days of the five day trip--the movie is segmented by day with pretty night ski-slope montages in between--will show the ramifications of that reaction in vivid, often times uncomfortable, detail. The two lead performances by Lisa Loven Kongsli and Johannes Bah Kuhnke are terrific; they truly inhibit this couple, as their at least outwardly strong marriage and family starts to unravel. At first it seems what transpired might not be that big of a deal, but it's there simmering underneath, and decisions by both in how they handle make it progressively more toxic. Nothing seems deliberately exaggerated, even what might be considered the film's climax: a huge turn quite hard-to-watch turn when Ebba and Tomas are with a few friends in their hotel room. There are other people who come into the scene--friends, casual acquaintances, and one particular stranger--who observe the couple in their conflict, viewing them almost as we the viewers of the movie do; or viewing them while apart from one another, as the two are in much of the movie's second act. The actors playing the daughter and son do good job, and though the film clearly isn't as much about them it's interesting to see how they react to their parents' escalations. The film ends (don't worry, no spoilers here) with a fascinating sequence. For what the filmmakers tried to do, it could have so easily looked clumsy, forced, or like a cliché. But it's pulled off spectacularly: a revelation which wraps the story up in a striking, arguably brilliant fashion. Few films, in my opinion, have such a near-perfect conclusion as this one, and the journey taking us to that point is never showy and frequently powerful. No one, I believe, can watch this film and help but think ""How would I really react?"" But this film is about much more than that, strewn with themes like marriage, gender roles in a family, masculinity and others that are analyzed in poignant and perceptive ways. The way characters outside the two main are utilized is also something to behold. Definitely see this movie."
" Scandinavian hysterics
",-0.4215,0.5686,2018-01-28 00:00:00,1,"This film was highly praised in (Belgian) newspapers for its ice cold depiction of a marriage being swallowed up by an avalanche, so to say. My eagerness to watch it was, as you might imagine, set in motion!Yet it didn't take long to get me all worked up. What started out with such potential quite rapidly unravelled into a combination of irritatingly one-dimensional charachters, an almost cartoonish portrayal of events and numerous pointless scenes. Scandinavian film making unworthy, truly!"
" Fascinating and absorbing
",0.5423,0.2742,2017-12-26 00:00:00,9,"Fascinating and absorbing. From the score to the non-speaking parts to the beautiful mountain shots, every moment supports the central question and the central characters' journey. It's a film built for discussion...like a Linklater movie but with more plot and tension. The pacing was off at points, but almost everything else was just right."
" A must see about the limits of family commitment
",0.3818,0.9392,2017-11-25 00:00:00,7,"Not ever a movie brought such strong matter for debate. For sure many couples will do it after watching this food for thought movie in which everyone is invited to take a stand and eventually imagine oneself in both sides of the situation. It's a powerful movie in the sense that after laying out a simple, plain holiday family story, needs only a 20 seconds scene in which the absence of an expected attitude from the husband is enough to undermine the grounds of a marriage and therefor totally change the course of the holiday and possibly the entire future of that family. After the ""little"" incident everything appears normal again but a fly in the ointment becomes more and more visible and the issue can no longer be put aside for the sake of convenience. Everything changed because one of the most elemental bricks in a marriage - trust - ceases to exist. What to do then? The unfolding of the before versus the after is very interesting to watch, specially the aftermath of the incident in which the lowest point is reached when an overwhelming scene of total inner desperation is magnificently presented, laying totally open for display the wound of the abyss of that lost human being who can no longer put himself up for life. A heartbreaking moment of child tenderness and its participation against the implosion of that marriage is beautifully set, being the girl the last resort for keeping the ties when she practically demands that the mother consoles her father. A negative point is the length of the movie and the superfluous 2 further scenes. Despite bringing ambiguity and richer facets to the matter of the film, they however weaken an already autonomous story that can perfectly live by itself."
" Men to the rescue
",0.5106,0.9609,2017-10-29 00:00:00,7,"In a society that is in constant change, sometimes it is difficult to know where your place is. And nowadays this feels harder than ever, with social networks, smartphones and constant connection to every corner of the world. So many things are happening that sometimes people are not sure about their position in society or family, or even what they are supposed to be and do. And this adjusting may be in particular hard for the ones that have been more privileged and have had more power. Not because they have lost privileges, but because they feel they are losing their position in the world, their prerogatives and rights. And it is hard for them to accept that.And that is what ""Force Majeure"" is about. A perfect family of four are having dinner in a restaurant when an avalanche happens. At first they take it as a thing to take pictures of and enjoy, a controlled avalanche. However little by little the avalanche comes closer to the restaurant... and the man decides to run for his life leaving his two children and wife behind.From that moment on we have a really engaging look on family, relationships, women and men's position on society and how difficult it is to the privileged to accept changes or their loss of power. By looking at a family, Östlund develops all these ideas in a subtle but never superficial way. The pace is slow and takes its time, but it never lets the viewer down and it adds little by little to the story. Some imaginary is too heavy-handed (like the toilet moments in particular), but in general the direction is spot on and all the moments have relevance to what is happening, with some touches of humor to stop the story to becoming too dark and broody.""Force Majeure"" is a really interesting movie."
" A surprisingly slight tale
",0.296,0.8093,2017-08-03 00:00:00,3,"On release, FORCE MAJEURE was widely applauded as a bleak Swedish comic drama, in which a father's act of cowardice during a family skiing holiday has powerful repercussions for his place in the family. It sounded good, but having just endured watching it, I can report that the praise is unfounded. This is a simple character drama, of the type they make so many of, and it has little to recommend it. The events depicted early on are surprisingly trivial, and the film fails to make the protagonists in any way likable, so watching them argue, fight, and cry is a real chore. The actor from GAME OF THRONES is the only thing I liked about this slow, slight, and uninteresting tale, which is about as interesting as watching paint dry."
" Where we learn how easily trust can be lost....
",0.6908,0.9904,2017-07-24 00:00:00,8,"How far can we trust each other in marriage? What kind of trust do we accept, or place? What happens when trust is put in jeopardy? Can you trust your life to your wife (or husband)? How do you know - truly know - either way? If trust is gone, what happens to any marriage ... or any relationship?What would you, I, anybody do when we lose the trust of our partner? Or vice-versa?Implicitly and explicitly, this story uses those issues as its thematic thrust, initiated by a seemingly close encounter - by a typical tourist family at a ski resort - with a controlled, snow-laden avalanche which, for a few terrifying seconds, comes too close to the restaurant setting where the family is having breakfast on the terrace. As the fog of snow and ice enveloped the family (along with other tourists), panic followed, immediately: the father, Tom (Kuhnke) grabbed his cell-phone etc to flee into the hotel, leaving his wife, Ebba (Kongsli) desperately clinging to and covering the daughter and son, Vera and Harry (both Wettergren), and screaming to Tom to come back to help. Blurred vision and screaming sound fade to ... white silence (as the snow fog thickens, but gradually dissipates as we watch).That's the heart-thumping action, all in two minutes or so. The rest of the story centers upon Tom and Ebba, mainly, as they warily discuss what happened, what each did, and why. Naturally, each holds a different story in their heads, a different perspective about what really went down - thus providing a number of opportunities for a goodly number of highly emotive exchanges. However, on the final day of their stay, after much personal to-and-fro angst, Tom unexpectedly proves his worth - or did he? - on their final downhill ski run, with Ebba and the children, during a white-out.A happy ending, or so we think as we watch them, next morning, boarding a bus to begin the homeward journey. It's here, however, that the screenwriter/director provides a third perspective - an all inclusive one, you could say - which balances the scales between Tom and Ebba, conclusively and categorically. It's an innovative end to this story - one which, I understand, caused some dissatisfaction for many viewers - but not the end of the issue. That's something we all have to live with, every day of our relationships.The acting is adequate if not Academy Award level; direction is competent; dialogue is realistic and appropriate; and the resort scenery, beautifully captured, is merely a prop. At two hours, it probably seemed too long for some, yet it held my interest without flagging because it's a story which demonstrates how trust is so hard to earn, so easy to lose, and almost impossible to win back.Recommended for all, including adolescents.

" Simply boring.
",-0.3182,0.9761,2017-06-08 00:00:00,3,"Why this film was nominated for Golden Globe and won Guldbaggen and other film prizes, must be simply because some important people in the juries recognize the kind of life rendered in the movie, and for only this reason find it amusing and enjoyable in a parody fashion. I simply find it boring. The director of this mediocre project has won the Palme d'Or for his latest film, the Square. I really hope it's far better than Tourist, or Ruben Östlund must hit some cinematic nerve that I just don't understand, and never want to understand either. I really don't think he has found any nerve in directing the actors in this film other than making it annoying. They are mainly overacting and some times remind me of the many horrific Norwegian films from thirty years ago or so. Are they supposed to be funny? They are not, nor is the effect of the on and off sudden music score, with an accordion playing Vivaldi on over speed. Please casters, there are other and much better actors if you just look a bit outside the regular click in Oslo and Stockholm. Only the non professional kids seem actually natural in their acting, and well acting children is always a plus, one of the few in this more or less dull film. It's the main reason for giving it as much as 3 stars."
" Scenes from a Marriage in the Snow
",0.0,-0.7147,2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"With Ruben Östlund just having won the Palme d'Or for The Square, he could look back at Force Majeure as having given him a foot in the door for Cannes recognition. Watch out for the IMDb synopsis, giving the impression this is a survival story. It's nothing of the sort; the family are not actually in the avalanche, no one is harmed in what was a controlled avalanche. The key is that for a split second, it appears to get out of control, and the husband's reaction breaks down trust in his marriage. Force Majeure is essentially Scenes from a Marriage in the Snow, a marriage drama in which the wife struggles with abandonment issues, and the family could come apart. This, and some beautiful, striking photography are two key qualities of the film, though those out only for an action/survival story will not appreciate this.On the down side, Force Majeure does drag in parts; Östlund can't expect to be Ingmar. The end, with the bus, where the roles of wife and husband are reversed, does lack subtlety- yes, it turns out we don't know how we'll always react, and perceived brushes with death, however mistaken, will lurk behind every single corner. Still, it's obvious why Östlund would have established himself as a director to watch with this."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.9148,2017-05-08 00:00:00,1,"Quite frankly, this was the worst film I have ever seen. It is so bad that I am writing my first review to help people avoid the mistake I made. Everyone in my environment who watch the movie were very disappointed too, and some had to re-sell it immediately. Seriously, I think people that are giving high marks to this film are trolling. The movie basically pictures a family in a sky resort, and when they are in the cafeteria, an avalanche occurs. The man of the family got scared and ran away. The rest of the movie is just about the wife complaining on him for running away instead of staying with his family. That's it. Nothing else. You can try to see more and describe it with deep and eloquent words, but the film is quite bad. You are warned! The photography is beautiful, though."
" Husband and wife struggles
",-0.3612,0.8583,2017-04-22 00:00:00,7,"A different movie experience This film addresses both gender roles, intercourse issues and how to deal with crises. The movie is good, but demanding to watch. The actors do a great job, especially the main actors as the couple who are really put to the test. When I saw this movie it is easy to think how one would react in different situations. For example, it's a little odd to me that the husband getting faster and clearly confronted by his wife. But she tries in her own way. The tension rises between them. The film therefore also provides insights into reactions and how people handle unpleasant episodes in close relationships. There is no fuss on such, but this couple is not good at it, to express it in one way. The score are also used very effective. The film is slow and a well-performed movie drama"
" Interesting film
",0.4019,0.9439,2017-04-18 00:00:00,7,"For me, the main theme of the movie is owning up to yourself.I think the film is at its best when Tomas is confronted with is actions, first when Tomas and Ebba takes a beer with another couple, and then after the dinner with Tomas' friend and his girlfriend.Off course, Ebba has a problem with Tomas leaving them during the avalanche, but I think the problem grows much bigger when Tomas denies it. The moments of denial are brilliantly played, in my opinion.I think the discussion between Tomas' friend and his girlfriend afterwards also is interesting. But here, I think the roles are switched. Because the girlfriend first comes with accusations, and then, when he wants to discuss them, she backs away and just tell him to forget it. If the accusations are legitimate or not is not possible to know for us. But it is clear that they need to be resolved in one way or another. And they are not. Just as Tomas' and Ebbas situation is not resolved until Tomas' breakdown.The situations where the film is most confusing to me are the ""accident"" of Ebba in the mountains, and the scene in the bus at the end. They seem a bit out of character for her, and they also seem constructed and not entirely believable. They make me question whether the main concern for Ebba is her children, or her husband taking care of her. It is totally irresponsible for Tomas to leave his children in the middle of the slope searching for Ebba. It is also strange that Ebba in the bus, suddenly is not concerned for her children anymore.I like how the film contrasts the dramatic event with our protected lives. If we always live in our safe bubbles, there are sides of ourselves and of our close ones, that we are never confronted with."
" Leaves you with the disturbing idea that you may never truly know the people closest to you
",-0.6914,0.9574,2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Wounded machismo and domestic disintegration are the order of the day in Swedish director Ruben Ostlund's comedy drama Force Majeure. Holidaying together at a fancy ski resort in the French Alps, the family at the centre of the story are presented as the pinnacle of bliss and success. Mum Ebba (Lisa Loven Kongsli) and Dad Tomas (Johannes Kuhnke) and both good-looking and financially comfortable, and along with their children Vera (Clara Wettergren) and Harry (Vincent Wettergren), make for a Kodak-cute unit, highlighted in the opening scene where they are badgered into posing for a few snaps by a tourist photographer. Tomas is taking a break from his busy work- life, and Ebba is happy to have her husband by her side for a week. As they ski, nap and dine together, frequent explosions - creating 'controlled avalanches' - boom in the distance, suggesting that something troubling is looming.On their second day. the family relax in a cafe when an avalanche starts to rush in the distance. What begins as curiosity and excitement soon turns to terror as it appears that the giant wall of snow is heading straight for them. They are engulfed in mist, but are relieved to discover that the avalanche came to a halt some way off. As the fog clears, Ebba still embraces her children, while Tomas is nowhere to be seen, although he has remembered to save his iPhone. It would seem that the husband and father isn't quite the man they thought he was, and this sets off an incredibly uncomfortable yet shrewdly funny breakdown of the photogenic unit over an increasingly long week away. At first, Tomas refuses to admit any wrongdoing, but is pecked away at by his wife and eventually confronted in two particularly uncomfortable scenes over dinner and drinks. Even his buddy Mats (Game of Thrones' Kristofer Hivju) struggles to defend his cowardly actions.Shot with a Michael Haneke-esque eye for emotional violence and domestic unravelling, Force Majeure is often far more awkward than the work of Ricky Gervais, thanks to Ostlund's ear for witty, realistic dialogue and some committed performances from the leads. Tomas' fall from hard-working patriarch to emasculated cry-baby is both brutal and utterly hilarious. Ostlund clearly doesn't like the privileged bourgeois, and has fun picking them apart. The most wince-inducing scenes are somewhat relieved by the comedic timing of Hivju, who inspires humour by merely reacting to the horror playing out in front of him, siding with his friend as his much-younger girlfriend Fanni (Fanni Metelius) comforts Ebba. The gender divide is drawn in the snow, and thanks for a conversation between Mats and Fanni where the latter throws hypotheticals at her recently-divorced fella, this is perhaps the worst film in the history of film to watch with your partner. While it could have benefited from a running-time trim, Force Majeure leaves you with the disturbing idea that you may never truly know the people closest to you."

To make room for FORCE MAJEURE, Ms. Hogg had to leave such Crowd Pleasers as AMER!CAN SNIPER, MOCKINGJAY, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, CAPTAIN AMER!CA: WINTER SOLDIER, and THE LEGO MOVIE off her Top Ten Honor Roll. ""What's wrong with that?"" you might argue, ""Everyone's entitled to her own opinion!""

Sometimes Payola can take the form of a Booty Call in the arms of some Swedish PR Flac dude built like Thor.

" A movie about crying men
",-0.4767,-0.4742,2017-01-16 00:00:00,4,"This is a feminist movie. The women are strong and accuse the men of everything. Men are weak Swedish guys who spend a lot of time crying and complaining why the heck they did what they did. Visually the movie is nice to watch, it's just extremely boring and I feel embarrassed for the actors.I was hoping for the avalanche to wipe out the family and their two friends, that would have saved a lot of trouble from everybody. It would also have saved us from any possible sequel with the same actors.The gas guns trying to launch a controlled avalanche are also extremely disturbing as they bring zero value to the movie. Maybe the director just need some other sound than just the crying."
