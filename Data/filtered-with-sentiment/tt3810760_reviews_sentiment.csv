" All Over The Place - This Movie is Self Promoting Hodgepodge
",0.3612,0.108,2021-03-02 00:00:00,1,So disappointing. Loved No Impact Man so thought I would like this. A few parts were mildly interesting but this movie has no focus and was a hugely missed opportunity to present more facts and less random clips of generalizations and self promotions. Zero depth.
" 2 White Guys Think They Invented Minimalism
",0.0,0.9171,2021-01-27 00:00:00,2,"After a few years of exploring minimalism, I was excited to watch this documentary, hoping to find even more advice or tips on how to live minimally. Instead I watched a super long ad for 2 guys who are making tons of money off telling Americans that they spend too much money - which seemed pretty obvious to most people already.
I see they have good intentions, but the thing that annoyed me the most was that the main guy acted and spoke like he invented minimalism. Sir, no, no you didn't. I'm pretty sure it's been a long practiced idea in almost all religions, especially Buddhism, where it teaches you not to become attached to physical things. Also when you realise that the 2 guys in this basically released the exact same documentary a year or 2 ago, plus wrote multiple books and charge $5 per podcast episode, it starts to become more of a corporate, money making exploitation of minimalism.
In short, I didn't learn anything practical and i'd recommend many other youtubers, books, free podcasts, etc. to learn more about minimalism."
" Thought Provoking
",-0.2023,0.4235,2021-01-21 00:00:00,7,"The film is very thought provoking and is worth watching because of the self-examination it invites. I enjoyed the thoughts and decisions it brought up in myself and the discussion it elicited with my wife.In general, I agree with the overall concept of not consuming material goods for the sake of material goods, but most of the detailed aspects of minimalism, as described by the directors, don't seem to hold up went though through to their conpletion."

Our lives and our world would be more beautiful and more meaningful if people were open to receiving the lessons in this movie... It is time to realize that this is your one and only life.
" This was bad.
",-0.5423,0.8533,2021-01-06 00:00:00,1,"I really wanted to like this, the subject interested me a lot. But it just didn't do it. When the two guys talked and gave monologues, it was obviously scripted, in a bad way. They seemed really egocentric. I think they were trying to promote themselves instead of the lifestyle. I wish they'd just tell us more about minimalism itself rather then their stories and telling us why they're and we're wrong. More like a documentary then just wanting us to become minimalists, probably to benefit them since they're public figures. Honestly, I had to watch the whole 1 hour film in 4 different sittings cause I was really bored."

You can't be the creator and promoter of the consumerist culture and be against it at the same time. You can't destroy countries to promote brainless market economy and try to fix the damages caused by it at the same time. It doesn't work that way."
" Overplays the evolutionary biases in our natures
",0.0,0.953,2020-12-24 00:00:00,2,"Too simplistic.At the start of the flick a neuropsychologist and entrepreneur talk about how we are 'hard wired to be addicted' and how this would have been helpful throughout our evolution.I don't think this is really correct. There are many human societies who do not share our unending hunger for 'the next consumer hit' and are not trapped in dopamine fueled cycles of self reinforcing activities like checking social media multiple times an hour. The current depression-pleasure cycle of human behavior is more likely to be an outgrowth of human evolution AS EXPOSED TO THE MODERN WORLD and all it's attention grabbing products and arbitrary time consuming routines like school work etc. This makes people feel stressed and disempowered and to then habitually prioritize short term thinking - as we would when faced with real danger and stress 'in the wild'. This cycle is probably not an inherent state of existence in itself.
We have dopamine and pleasure based reward systems due to evolution which help motivate us but this does not mean we are 'hard wired to be addicted' as default. It is more complicated than that and I don't like it when people make big science-y claims that have no solid evidence behind them just because they sound plausible and attractive. A lot of research suggests we also evolved to take it easy A LOT and allow our bodies to efficiently use the limited calories we could acquire, not just keep pushing and pushing."
" It feels like one hour long advertisement
",0.3612,0.9718,2020-12-13 00:00:00,2,"Well, for a documentary that wants to present the minimalist approach to its audience, it does not make use of that at all.
My issues with this one are that:1. It has a lot of repetitive speeches,
2. The whole doc felt for me like a hypocritical statement, because they present you how bad the advertising on social media has become and all the impulsive purchases that are the result of that, but still they use the exact same tactics and advertising to promote their goal, which from what I've seen is to buy the book of the 2 main protagonists that show up in this doc film.Overall its just felt like an hour long advertising, which in the end I can say that the focus wasn't in explaining what minimalism really is and how beneficial it can be. It was just to promote a product (their book).Still, there is one thing that I've liked about this, which is the final statement when the doc ended: ""Love people and use things. Because the opposite never works."""
" Alot of lost poor souls coming together over stupidity.
",-0.8074,-0.8792,2020-10-20 00:00:00,1,"I had to write a review about how extremely shallow and stupid this documentary is. It is one of the stupidest films I have seen in the last few years.Opens with guy with a smart phone, a car, a house, and everything he needs, who tries to explain how proud he is of having so little in his life. Almost all the people featured in this documentary are upper middle class americans who realised they have been overspending money on trash. Completely unbeknowst that this is not normal. And infact, we dont live like that in Europe, Asia or Africa. Guess what America, we know you overspend. You caused the housing crash financial crisis ten years ago.So here we are witnessing a bunch of idiots basically who now claim this thing called minimalism is their new religion. Typical american way of thinking, taking everything to the extreme. Either they want maximalism or they want minimalism. Completely disregarding that this approach has been practiced in other countries such as those following buddhism, where Buddha preached this 2500 years ago.There's nothing new with the concept of this documentary. The only new thing here is the complete lack of self-insight for these americans. The storytelling is just so offputting, and it doesnt help with one of the main characters who used to be a CEO, needing to hug everyone. He talks more about hugging people who doesn't want a hug, than he talks about minimalism. Alot of lost poor souls here coming together over a new found religion."

" Contradictory!
",-0.4003,0.7136,2020-09-07 00:00:00,2,"I like the idea that the documentary promotes, however everyone in this show obviously earned enough money to live this 'minimal' lifestyle... it's kind of like they built enough capital in their 6 figure jobs to quit everything and live off their reserves, then write a book to make some more money should that run out.Many of the people interviewed and the main two narrators pushing their book had Apple MacBook Pro's! How do you live a minimal lifestyle whilst owning the most expensive laptop money can buy.Lastly the guy who worked in Wall Street in finance and was 'financially minted', he got a promotion and said he has never been happier since he walked out the job and never went back, he then went travelling the world!!!! How on earth do most people do that??? if I followed suit I'd loose my house, my car, probably my wife, my kids would suffer and I'd have enough money in the bank for up to two weeks in a budget hotel in the adjoining town and then what?? Why did they show this person as an example - basically his whole scene was ""I earned a tonne of money to enable me to travel the world and now I'm really happy"""

This makes it very drawn out, which in term makes it very boring to me. The message behind the documentary, to look at the things we have in our life, and evaluate if it has meaning is an important one. However, the documentary didn't apply this philosophy to itself. I am not here to learn about these guys being huggers, or to see them going around the country. I am here to find out about minimalism. The documentary talks about it, but it is filled with all this other stuff I don't need. Much like the message of the documentary itself, I turned it off for this reason."

",0.0,0.8431,2020-06-15 00:00:00,6,"This documentary resonated with me and a bunch of friends around me.It gave insight into the minimalist idea and material ways of living that lifestyle.
It was also great to see Matt Da'Vella's work for myself.However, the one thing I will say, is that it skewed too far in one direction without giving a bigger picture view. It was a great idea, and the story was probably crisp, but the execution didn't meet what I was thinking of.But at the end of the day, maybe my opinion doesn't matter because the goal of the documentary was to do just that.
Interesting documentary otherwise."

" Felt like minimalism is a new religion against capitalism
",0.3612,-0.3423,2020-06-08 00:00:00,5,"I like the concept of minimalism, so I was really curious about this piece of documentary. However, the more I continiued watching the more it felt like a bad advertisement for a new religion where they travel around to tell people like they have been told something holy overnight. The fact that they are huggers will not even make it cuter but worse after this point. The story arc is completely confusing, jumping from small houses to choosing minimalistic clothing, from meditation to advertisement for children. None of these stick with the viewer, unfortunately.
I also must add, I dont know how minimalisim is lived in different countries but in the end this documentary just made me feel like it is something americans need in order to escape from haunting of capitalism."

" Great Introduction for Minimalism
",0.6249,0.9015,2020-05-15 00:00:00,9,"Honestly,i don't concur with the harsh criticisms about this documentary. It is obvious that if you want to learn more about minimalism,then you should read more and research more.This documentary per se will not be sufficent.However,in the documentary,they talk about important basics such as ""Quality over Quantity"", the benefits of living in the smallest space possible,the fact that there is nothing wrong with consumerism but the compulsory consumerism,how you should give more value to your health,growth relationship,growth and contribution than your stuff,the importance of living at the moment than worrying about past or future,or the fact that minimalism is not a radical lifestyle .Also,i can feel that the underlying motive in the movie is more about spreading the recipe for minimalism than publicizing the book.All in all,i think this is a great documentary about minimalism,thanks a lot for that."
" A self-promotional documentary about a book tour
",0.0,0.8627,2020-05-13 00:00:00,1,"Under the guise of a primer on minimalism, this film starts out with doom-and-gloom about American consumerism to pivot into documenting a book tour. Viewers are subjected to endless scenes from the book tour, shots of the stars hugging strangers for no reason (are they promoting minimalism or the free hugs movement?) and the same repetitive information. If the lack of substance in this documentary is any indication, the book they're promoting must be pretty light-on.Unfortunately the doom and gloom left me feeling more depressive than empowered, which undermines the message about the positive power of minimalism. This probably should have been a 10-minute TED talk, rather than a feature-length documentary.If you're looking for a great primer on minimalism, keep looking. The hint is in the title: this show is about ""The Minimalists"" (the moniker the stars of the documentary go by, rather than Minimalism."
" An inspiring film but bad as a documentary
",-0.5927,-0.9118,2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,"I think this film is quite inspiring for those who are interested in or want to try minimalism themselves. The questions that are asked several times in the film are indeed important in our life: what are really important to us? Do we really need this and that? After watching it, I think quite a few would like to do something to be more minimalist.
BUT as a documentary, this is a true disappointment. Or to say, it is rather an advertisement for the book authors and the mini house designers. Regarding the narrative of the book tour, I see no necessary relevance to the concept of minimalism. It was more like a biography of a bestseller. At this point, it has differed from the original topic: minimalism.
Besides, I am not a huge fan of the idea that minimalism is the solution of a problematic life. But unfortunately, the film was implying this. Everybody had a bit problem in the life. Then they became minimalists and the problems went away. It is a very dangerous signal. Because minimalism is not THE SOLUTION to the problems, which do not go away automatically if we become a minimalist. It is only a tool to help us concentrate on our problems and fight for/against them.
Not everybody can/should become an author and write about their minimalist life, or leave their carrier behind and go travelling the whole world (why is that minimalist anyway?). But how the concept helps in the normal life, especially in the metropolises, it is actually an interesting part but unfortunately not been given that much notice in this film.
Last but not the least, this film is actually NOT THAT OBJECTIVE about minimalism. It is more or less an advertisement for this concept, or this life style. It kept showing us how the minimalists live and how the problems in their lives are solved somehow. This is fairly ironic since it is what was criticised once in the movie: to sell the dream to live a perfect life. But there is no perfect life, and minimalism is definitely not a direct solution to any of our problems."

The topic of becoming a minimalist certainly has broad appeal in a world full of consumer slobs such as myself. This doc spends a lot of time on the physical cleaning and tiny house downsizing and no time highlighting examples of ""the Important Things"" gained by becoming a minimalist... Which is what I was hoping to learn by watching. The book-tour road trip side-story was unnecessary and if anything, felt like an advertisement for the book (which compelled me to hit the fast-forward button a few times).

Since these particular people bought a lot of stuff and were in debt because of it, stuff was the enemy.It's also eye rolling for someone who made ""6 figures"" (which is constantly said) to insinuate it's ""easy"" to just ""travel and find life"". Yeah, those years of making a large income make that possible for you.

The idea of minimalism is great, but these two guys are just tryin to get rich . I'm not even sure I believe they ARE minimalists or if that's just what they show you on camera. The houses they show are probably just Air B n Bs they rented to film the documentary."
" Left me wanting more in the way of substance
",0.0,0.9897,2020-02-23 00:00:00,5,"Here's a doc, one would think, for all the neo-Yuppies and pack rats out there, either living the high life as status seekers or as those enslaved by their material possessions. These are the types of people I think the two subjects in MINIMALISM are out to reach whilst on their book tour/lecture circuit, but are these ones even in attendance, or does not their message speak only for those already converted to this rather commonsensical and practically timeless notion?Call it ""Voluntary Simplicity"" (which has been around for decades), frugality, or Christly spirituality, what these two subjects present in this picture is certainly nothing new, and yet this documentary follows these two young men around as if they were philosophical trailblazers who have hit upon a radically novel approach to living. My guess is that millions of people are already eschewing the fast lane and conspicuous consumption for a life of moderate consumerism, without giving it a name or feeling the need for there to be a movement around for (ambitious) spokespersons to champion and promote.In MINIMALISM, there's footage of a mob elbowing their way into a retail store in a mad rush to get inside, overcome by the gimmies. We're introduced to a globe-trotting derelict as well as a man who used to work on Wall Street, up until he walked away from it in order to pursue a less money-centric lifestyle.I found the documentary to be at its best whenever it was less about its two subjects giving interviews on talk shows or hosting speaking engagements and being treated like they were cultural pioneers.One needn't even have to go as far back in time to the early Christians to find teachings pertaining to the golden mean. Here I think of Henry David Thoreau's ""Walden,"" for example, published just a little more than a century ago.Recently, I watched a film about self-help gurus. In it, there was a clip of an overly enthusiastic and stentorian speaker asking of his audience who among them wants more (as in more money and stuff). It was all so very rah-rah, with the guru acting like a cheerleader, and the audience members responding by way of excited applause and unified shouts in the affirmative. And this is why the basic concept of living in moderation will never catch on with the majority, at least not in the faithless and secular parts of the world. Not only are most consumers seemingly excessively acquisitive by nature but these ones live in a culture where some if not most of their perceived wise men condone if not outright promote overconsumption! Still, I would not recommend MINIMALISM to such ones, as it's a doc more about two guys on a book tour than it is a message picture about not being materialistic, wasteful, shallow, and indulgent."

The film does a good job of showing the emptyness of materialism and introducing the viewer to a new movement, but it doesn't really put anything in the place of that emptyness. One senses that many of those interviewed are trying to fill St Augustine's ""God-sized vacuum"" with frugality. Still, the idea of contentment with less is a good one. I hope it catches on"

I'm not a minimalist but do a better job than the main guys in the documentary. They need their sunglasses, necklaces, hair gels, and most awkwardly a hair dryer. As a documentary about overt consumption, it attempts to target money and Wall Street to blame, it doesn't make sense. One character, that's considered a minimalist, has a laptop but still has a bluetooth mouse, that's not being minimalist a laptop already has a integrated mouse. It's a massive fail in my book, they keep blaming corporate jobs for societys' overconsumption which is an inadequate explanation. I was expecting more.

I believe it needs more data and more exploration of the viewpoint of the advertisers and marketers to see how they feel about targeting to children and fueling the consumption of junk. As it stands most will look at this film and say this is a ""hippie"" leftist movement and dismiss a very real and true message. The fact is consumerism in the west is driven by corporate advertisers which is tied to stock price and shareholder value. This will only end by ending Capitalism or by legislation. Neither will ever happen until society is on the brink of collapse because of excess. Those driving it as are at the top of the food chain. This film needed to explore this aspect more thoroughly."

Yes it's nice to have a house full of stuff to make it look more lively but sometimes it is best to always narrow it down to some stuff you really need on a day to day basis (utensils, table, toaster,chairs, etc).Anyways enough gabbing, the documentary was really interesting on how people take on the ""minimalist"" lifestyle in different ways like making their houses smaller and having less stuff in their houses. I really liked hearing Joshua Fields Millburn (who looks like River Phoenix)and Ryan Nicodemus' stories on how they got where they are today. They have likeable personalities and honestly I could just listen to them all day lol. I'm shocked to see that there was less interest in any of their talks shown in the film.

But of course, one of the main points of minimalism is to not need outside validation to be happy. 🤷‍♂️Also, not sure if this a directorial error, but the least interesting people in the documentary are probably the two main people highlighted on the cover - The Minimalists. They have the least practical and actionable substance to say but unfortunately seem to get the most screentime."

" Some interesting ideas.
",0.4019,0.9387,2019-07-10 00:00:00,5,"A film that sadly doesn't practice what it preaches. Whilst I agree with a lot of this and definitely see the appeal of a minimal lifestyle, the two guys (Josh & Ryan) telling this, their story are quite annoying, in a slightly pushy self help kinda way. Commercialism is certainly a problem though to my mind, we accumulate and consume far too much, partly through habit and mostly through advertising. Thankfully though, it's not all Josh & Ryan, there are lots of interesting stories here, from quite full-on almost 'off grid' approaches to simpler smaller reductions and there's some cool and thought provoking stuff shared. It's American focused (isn't everything) and the driver is not only a holistic one, but unsurprisingly an economic need. The tiny house idea is wonderful and made me feel quite uncomfortable truth be told, but I'd have been happier if this documentary had more focus on the functionality of minimalism and less a puff piece for Josh & Ryan who ultimately made it feel ironically bloated. 8/10 for the idea, but for the execution... 5/10"
" Interesting but felt like a sales pitch.
",0.6249,0.971,2019-06-23 00:00:00,2,"I like the underlying sentiment and enjoy learning about minimalism. I also liked the segments about consumerism and fast fashion, having studied those effects. One thing I didn't like is how it centered almost exclusively on financially well off people. I was left feeling like their brand of minimalism was unattainable for me as I was still questioning the cost of the luxury tiny houses, world traveling, and high-end looking apartments. A huge issue I felt was that the film was in one breath rightfully criticizing consumerism and in the other breath promoting The Minimalists book. It felt like a huge book advertisement which just made it fall very flat when that very issue is criticized in the film. It feels like there was so much dissonance between the intended message and the messengers. It was way too long for what the content was. If they took out all the book tour content it would have been a much more enjoyable watch."

They haven't talked about any practical advices on how to be a minimalist nor do they explain the point of it. It's only about them and how rich they are and now they are living like a rich homeless person. In one moment in the movie some woman said how she throw away most of her clothes and how all the clothes that is left is amazing, which is really not a point of being a minimalist.

There's a lot of debate that can be generated from this topic and I don''t think there's any certain path that can guid you through a ""minimalist life"". In the end, you're the one who chooses how much you want to get rid of stuff and what, sort of, ""level of minimalism"" you want to achieve. I like the fact that it is thought provoking, at least, and that it sparks interest to people who are discontent about their life and who want to bring change to it, by trying this new hype called ""minimalism"", which seems to exponentially escalate in the century of cosumerism."

I use the word ""documentary"" loosely, as this more closely resembles some self-promotional video.""Does this item or possession give you joy or add value to your life?"" - I couldn't quite figure out who was ripping off who more. Did Marie Kondo cash-in on minimalism first? Or was it these guys? I don't even know.This was definitely more about ""the Minimalists"" themselves, rather than the concept of minimalism. Every now and then there was a little cross-promotion with some of their hipster friends' projects. When the Joshua Millburn started reading his book out loud in the desert I almost switched it off. The thing is, the guys' priorities in life were already messed up. Mine aren't. I could get rid of some stuff, but I already know what truly matters and live my life accordingly.While I can't remember the last time I purchased something materialistic, that wasn't a survival need, I do consume in other ways - via social media, my phone etc. That aspect of things was quite interesting - meditation, and removing stimuli (rather than just possessions) from your environment was a healthy reminder to me.Minimalism was disjointed, and a little too America-centric for such a universal concept. Gotta love all these minimalist people surrounded by all their expensive laptops and technology too. It all felt so rehearsed, scripted and fake - especially when that Joshua Millburn guy reminisces about the life events that made him reevaluate what mattered in life.Do yourself a favour - don't watch this. Switch off your TV instead and go throw some junk out."
" Imagine a life with less - Inspiring thought

But as a documentary flick it wasn't that great to watch as there wasn't much stories or ways explained to be one minimalist. The idea of minimalism has well influenced me and even i would like to follow this and also will spend time to explain the same to my friends and colleagues & relatives. Kudos to Dan Harris & Joshua Becker for coming up with this though provoking idea and helps the society to realize the importance of things in their life. The documentary ends with a beautiful storming dialogue from Dan Harris "" LOVE PEOPLE AND USE THINGS BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE NEVER WORKS"""

I was expecting to learn more about minimalism, but that could not add more than one or two articles I read online. It added one thing though, how different people apply minimalism. In a world of society that is so focused on consumerism, it is good to see variety of ways of applying minimalism to our life. Be ware: It makes you want to throw away the garbage you do not need!"

" Changed my life
",0.0,0.8575,2018-07-29 00:00:00,10,"I had this doc on my Netflix list for some time. The reason I didn't rush to watch it was because I knew I needed to be in the right head space to really appreciate it.
4 days ago I started a juice detox after a highly stressful period and without overthinking I selected it. 
With the clarity and non toxic state my head was in I understand exactly what it's telling us.
The thing is the path to happiness is ever changing and there will never be a clear cut answer but if you can take even just a small something from the doc and the stories you are told you can really learn something about that.It's about real human beings and the trappings and social pressures life presents. 
You will only take something from this if you are really ready to understand it and want something to change. 
Be brave people it's your life and you can make you own rules."
" The message is undermined by poor execution
",-0.6808,0.9951,2018-07-25 00:00:00,5,"I wanted to like this documentary, but it came across as being a rather repetitive infomercial for its ideas, or maybe that's just one idea. And it was way too much about these two guys instead of about the purported subject. In other words, the meat of this project could have been conveyed in about 30 minutes, not 80. One of its central problems is how vague it is about the two men. What exactly were the jobs they were discarding? Was it completely their decision to leave their jobs? Were there events in their lives that precipitated the sudden changes? Instead, we're given generalities, instant epiphanies. Okay, anyway...I applaud the mission, which is to make people rethink what stuff they need in their lives and what will make them happy. However, because we are all very different in what can make us happy, it (probably unintentionally) wants to tell us exactly what that is. For instance, in my life (I'm in my sixties now), I've collected about 350 books, 300 films, and 1200 LP's/CD's. And I pare down my collections to just what I reread, watch again, and listen to. These are things that add to my enjoyment of life. For someone else, it's going to be entirely different. One interviewee admits that our society really isn't that materialistic, because the stuff we buy is soon discarded for the latest things. Their enjoyment, or happiness, was temporary. And this hints at what's missing from their message. One person after another talks about how ""we are expected to do this"" or ""society wants us to"". With further analysis, they could have shown how propaganda techniques are used by Madison Avenue, as well as the psychological consultants employed by them and corporations to get the public to buy in. About 3/4 of our economy is dependent on consumerism. There's a lot about 21st century capitalism that could have been talked about here, as well as specifics on how technology companies exploit people's insecurities.Why is that important? Because just traveling around by car talking to a few hundred people in bookshops isn't going to change things much. You might get a few people onboard, but those people are going to be primarily young singles, as we see in the documentary. For instance, you can't really raise two or more children easily in a house that is 700 square feet. The solutions shown in the film don't address our most common family units, so it undermines their arguments.But as someone who grew up in the 60's, I can tell you that a lot of this ground was covered by people like Alan Watts and Baba Ram Dass back then, and I think their audience was much the same as today's. In fact, it should have been easier to convince the young back then to reject consumerism, because thought control of the masses is even more insidious now. But it didn't happen. I would mention that Baba Ram Dass, in his book Be Here Now, pinpoints why people aren't happy in the rich West. And it's wrong for the filmmakers to think that it is built into our DNA, because if you look at human history you can easily refute that argument. The reason was clearly enunciated by the Buddha, who realized that life is suffering, and that the suffering is due to desire. If you do not live in the Now, you are thinking about the future and what you want from it. Once you get that thing, it quickly becomes clear that you are still dissatisfied, because some other desire occurs. Capitalists are more than willing to step in to make sure that you still aren't happy. What the filmmakers miss here is that the crisis they faced was not merely existential, but spiritual. Rejecting mindless consumerism is laudable, but it does not guarantee that people will be happier as a result. And I think that, basically, people want love. We want to be loved."
" Good introduction to the concept
",0.4404,0.7044,2018-07-06 00:00:00,7,"I liked the message of the documentary. It argues that we don't need all the extra stuff that we are constantly collecting. This is obstructing us from things that really matter. You don't make space for that since consuming seems more fulfilling myopically and seems more urgent. 
There were examples of multititude of people speaking about apparels, home space, career related things which we just get hooked on to without rethinking if that is for us. 
The documentary didn't get very deep in the challenges of implementing it, or even the nuances and how several people have adopted it in their daily lives. There were traces of meditation helping, connecting with people, implementing this within a family or just your spouse. But it felt a little superficial. 
But overall I recommend it. The next time you are purchasing something, if this movie triggers a deliberation, then it has left a mark. It seems to have done for me."

" Boo F'kn Hoo

People begin to invent things to piss and moan about no matter how good they have it compared to rest of the world. Perhaps it's the nihilism creeping in that is destroying a people's sense of purpose and meaning in life. Maybe it's not the evil greedy capitalist overlords concocting a scheme to brainwash everyone into consumerism. I'm sorry but going off the grid and living in a log cabin and eating nothing but leaves and berries won't make you happy. What's the point if we can just go down the street a few miles and fill up our shopping carts with groceries? What about the infrastructure that modern capitalism created to dispose of all the trash we produce so we can have the luxury of such a clean environment. We so take for granted our profoundly advanced and established infrastructure that we forget what life is like without it imagining it looks like fresh streams and beautiful meadows where we all sit around and breathe the fresh mountain air. I'd like to see these two film-makers selling the merits of minimalism to the average person genuinely living it in poverty-stricken areas like sub-Saharan Africa. I think they might reconsider their premise after getting a whiff of the strewn about trash, dysentery and disease-infected streams that the locals have to draw water from due to not having any sewage treatment or filtration system."
" Great Documentary, Easy Access to Minimalism
",0.7906,0.9387,2018-02-28 00:00:00,8,"I am one kind of person who live for more stuff, actually I care much about what people think, and of course what I own. When they compliment me for the success I got with those expensive stuff, I feel proud and happy but not for long. I keep buying stuff, to maintain the proudness about these. Afterall I realize people don't really care about what I got.
The movie is somehow describe me, people may call they're crazy to go backward to the norm of society. Yes they do. But It's a good thing for us both in term of metal health and physical health when the environment get more burden from scare resources and pollution. 
And why this movie don't give any specific direction to minimalism and the purpose of it. I think it advice us to give be concentrate on each individual's important things. And that's what different between people. We can't tell exactly. We gonna find out our all ways. 
I feel grateful watching this. 
I will give myself a time to grow and become a minimalist, not because they ask me to or I admire them. But just because I'm tired of the way I used to live : Living for more."

Some may be more cynically inclined than others of course.Having said that, I won't knock the general idea of consumerism taking too much time and emotional value from any of us. But the question is, where to go and how to find a path for ones individual needs. As it is pointed out, how do you keep it minimal, when you have a family? And kids ... just the fact of them going to school at one point ... the social pressure of having the latest gadgets and best clothes ...

This is a documentary made for people who don't already live minimalist and haven't done any reading on the subject. This could serve as a great wake up call for many and all Western materialists should watch it. It's like an easy introduction to the topic.It doesn't do much for someone who already lives like that but so what? ""I rather read blogs on the subject and bla bla bla"", yeah okay sorry guess what? You are the egotistic hipster you so much like to mock. You don't need guidelines or blogs to live a minimalist life. To be able to choose minimalism is always a huge privilege as you can see in this documentary and I think this fact makes it easier for Western people to relate and absorb something from Minimalism."

Its not rocket science, its simple common sense. Now instead of working 5 days a week I work 2, simply by reducing the need to buy lots of stuff I don't actually need. Unless you love what you do so much that you want to be living at work then look at what you truly need when it comes to material possessions.

Minimalism is all about making a lifestyle change by getting rid of things that you don't need, things that do not add value to your life, in order to make room for the things in life that are actually important such as relationships and passions with more freedom and less stress. A person does not need to be wealthy in order to make a lifestyle change that adds to the quality their life. Anyone can make that change.

If you swapped minimalism with any other product, you'd quickly see that these guys are basically just crafty salesman. Hoping you'll buy not into minimalism, but their sales pitch for their book. It's smart, but transparent. I learnt literally nothing about Minimalism, this documentary has little or no insights. It's really just a pseudo documentary.

",0.6249,0.9047,2017-02-19 00:00:00,5,"In short, the truths / points / principals / lessons found in this documentary are essential for all people in the developed world, however that's where the beauty of this documentary ends. The disconnected storytelling, plot references and emotional neediness leave you feeling less than inspired. Still important to watch."
" Maximalist Review On Minimalist Lifestyle
",0.0,0.9955,2017-02-09 00:00:00,8,"My wife claims I'm a minimalist. I disagree whole-heartedly. Sure, I'm able to easily part with stuff, but I still have a lot of stuff. I have my baseball game wear, football game wear, basketball game... you get it. Even with the amount of clothes and other things I have I still strive for less. So, naturally, I was attracted to the title and subject of this documentary.In general, I favor documentaries. The simplicity of them, the unscriptedness and raw truth--even if it is only from a certain perspective. This documentary was no different. I am not a minimalist but I wouldn't mind being one. It is a lifestyle that I see as quite fulfilling and sustainable. It was exciting to hear from minimalists and how they arrived at that lifestyle. Some were single (as the featured duo were), some were married with and without kids so as to show how this way of life can work for various family structures.Some may have viewed the different participants in the documentary and only seen the myriad of things they would have to part with, or they may have seen a huge void. Me, I saw freedom. Freedom from stress, freedom from clutter (which is a big contributor to my stress), freedom from the pursuit of space for the stuff and freedom to move around or just be. It was a very nice documentary that is not wholly unique. The idea of anti-consumerism/anti-capitalism has been around for decades. Movies and documentaries in various forms have already been done condemning the idea of consumerism. This documentary does the same thing in a different manner. One thing I would've liked is to see a minimalist approach to those who accumulate stuff by other than purchasing--such as the junk mail collector, the memento collector or those who otherwise collect other largely useless trinkets. Their argument for keeping their stuff will always be that they never purchased it so how harmful can it be? In any case, the documentary is marvelous. I'm not a minimalist, I may never be a minimalist but it is still something I can greatly appreciate."
" White Finance Bros Find Enlightenment
",0.0,0.9537,2017-01-26 00:00:00,2,"If you want to hear about how two white finance bros stole Marie Kondo's minimalism idea then this is the movie for you. They go around the country telling people to simplify their lives by removing their possessions but keeping those most important to them, such as cars, phones, computers, nice sunglasses, and some of the other things seen on these guys throughout the movie. And add their book to your life of course! The only saving grace is otherwise decent commentary by scholars and experts. Other highlights include another former finance bro that became ""homeless"" by renting flats in other countries while traveling the world. I would love to see how minimal these people's bank accounts are."
" Hugging Hipsters Hawk Extreme Anti-Consumerist PsychoBabble
",0.4215,-0.4832,2017-01-18 00:00:00,1,"This may well be the most cringe-worthy film experience I've ever waded through in my life. There's nothing ""minimal"" about the excess marketing these annoying ""huggers"" are up to here, which appears to be the entire raison d'etre of the documentary, more about promoting their book than laying out a cogent manifesto for a movement. For instance, you hear glowing testimonials for ""tiny houses"" that sound like advertisements and then you note that Jay Austin, the guy doing the talking, is a ""Tiny House Designer"". If these upscale hipsters find satisfaction in assuaging their consumerism guilt by swinging to the opposite extreme I say more power to them. But don't try to convince me that it's the only way I can exist without contributing to ""the problem"". And I'm not buying it as a philosophy, it's already been done much better by Guatama Buddha (who gets some lip service in a short segment but not much more). But then again they don't present a compelling case for minimalism in the first place. And the cherry on the top is all the crappy totally extraneous music that intrudes into the proceedings on a regular basis. For a film about minimalism all that unnecessary music seemed to show it for what it really was: a boring long infomercial that insults viewers' sensibilities and intelligence in one fell swoop."
" Recommended if you don't know about Minimalism, otherwise not so much...
",0.2023,0.9485,2017-01-16 00:00:00,5,"If you have not heard about the minimalism movement and feel curious about it I totally recommend this movie (available on Netflix), it could be eye-opening and inspiring for you.However as a person who has read a few articles and watched a few videos on minimalism and consumerism issues, I found this documentary lacking in deep, new and engaging ideas. It felt more like a long promotional video for the book with interesting stories of people thrown in between. The excerpt from president Carter's speech was the most interesting part to me, the message might not be new but it was delivered with clarity and strength."
" A blueprint for a better way to live
",0.4404,0.8798,2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"This documentary illustrates what happens when you take a step back and evaluate what you need versus what you have. It's sobering when you're made aware of how much material items you posses that you don't use. It's even more gratifying when you realize how much happier you are without the mound of material possessions.This is the central theme of MINIMALISM: A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE IMPORTANT THINGS.Josh and Ryan, the authors of ""Everything That Remains"", take you on a journey across America to spread their message of a less cluttered, more substantial life. And it all starts with you, the individual.I was inspired by this documentary. I had recently begun to un-clutter my own life before seeing this, so it reinforced my drive.There are some points in the film that kept it from a higher rating (say an 8 or 9, instead of the 6 I gave it). There were two instances where the authors' message is hijacked by people with socio-political agendas, such as the Eco nut raving about consumption destroying the planet and the professor rattling on about the evils of child marketing. Neither of those issues is related to the message that Josh and Ryan seek to share, which is how to create change IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL WORLD. I even e-mailed the authors and advised them to watch out for socio-political movements trying to co-opt their platform.Other than those two instances, the documentary film will make you consider your personal habits and reassess what makes you happy.As Tyler Durden stated in another movie ""The stuff you own, owns you.""MINIMALISM forces you to confront the unnecessary stuff you own and see forward to a less cluttered, debt free and a meaningful existence."
