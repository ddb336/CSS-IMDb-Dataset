" History Written by the Victors
",0.0,0.9169,2021-04-09 00:00:00,7,"A predictably amber-hued depiction of the early day of the women's suffrage movement that ends with the funeral in 1913 of Emily Davidson rather than women finally getting the vote five years later after proving their ability to keep Britain ticking over while the male population were being slaughtered in France.Having long subscribed to the heretical view that women got the vote despite the suffragettes rather than because of them, I found conspicuous by their absence from this narrative either of the two real reasons women were enfranchised in 1918: The Great War (which Emmeline Pankhurst had enthusiastically supported) and the invention of the typewriter (which enabled the vast numbers of women unable to marry to find financial independence through office work).Ironically Meryl Streep makes a guest appearance as Emmeline Pankhurst (who later became a a Tory M. P.), since she had recently won an Oscar for playing Margaret Thatcher, the only prime minister in the past half century to have dared not to have included a single woman in her cabinet, and who broke the miners' strike with the same ferocity we here see used against the suffragettes.By further irony the majority of women voters have used that hard-won vote to keep the whip-hand in the sweaty paws of conservative governments (including that headed by Maggie's greatest fan, Tony Blair), so that over a hundred years after giving women over the age of 30 voting rights, Number 10 is currently occupied by yet another Old Etonian.More women are in the workplace these days because a couple can no longer afford to live on one income than as a lifestyle choice. But I suppose it's progress that when wage slaves arrive for work a few minutes late the manager curtly upbraiding them for their tardiness like the one seen here is in the 21st Century as likely to be female as male."
" Never surrender never give up the fight...Rather be a rebel than a slave
",-0.1531,0.2916,2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the historical drama Suffragette (2015) where in 1912 London, women do not have the rights to vote and literally are treated crap where wives are legally subordinate to husbands. A young working mother Maude Watts, played by Carey Mulligan, is galvanised into the feminist political movement made up of wives, daughters and mothers are fighting the rights for all women to vote. The women who are willing to meet violence with violence and use foot soldier like strategies to raise their cause and movement. Soon the women pursue a dangerous game of cat and mouse with an increasingly brutal English Government. Maude and Helena Bonham Carter's character Edith, are working women who had seen peaceful protest achieve nothing. Both women among others turn to violence to gain attention on what is their right among all women - equality and the only way to ensure change does occur is the will to lose everything in their fight for equality - their jobs, their homes, their children and their lives.Now I watched this flick due to finding out Meryl Streep played a historical figure, Emmeline Pankhurst, who was the main leader of the women's rights party however only has a brief cameo in the middle of the film who provides good lines in the movie, ""Never surrender never give up the fight...Rather be a rebel than a slave."" After that there is no footage of Streep which is a shame as the suffrage movement did evolved around this real-life character. Having said that the movie itself still does well with the filmmaker ensuring the atmosphere of the film's era was dark and claustrophobic and very male orientated. Mulligan's performance is really clever where you see the sides of a mother and wife however a woman in general who has gone through abuse by her laundry employer. You see her expressions and as a viewer you are invited to join her journey to be part of the female radicalised political movement. terrorist. The suffragette who threw herself under the King's horse scene - it would have been good to have this character to be part of the main actresses. A good history lesson flick however the filmmakers should have allowed a wider intake of the suffrage movement character rather than focusing only on 3 characters. As someone who has no clue on women rights, this film shows how fragile and hard-won those rights are however not on the key figures, which is a shame. The plot doesn't seem to be clear and the characters are a little underdeveloped including Violet and Emily. The poor storytelling holds Suffragette back, but it still has a powerful message about the struggles that past generations have faced to gain the freedoms that women have today - overall 7.2/10"

Women were no more than property, and men only could decide what could happen with their children. Women were beaten by the police and no one tried to stop them. The suffragettes paved the way for other countries to allow women to vote. I'm not sure that everyone understands what they endured for future generations.The acting is top notch and it was great to see Meryl Streep as Mrs Pankhurst, the leader of the movement.I think it's worth a watch."

It clearly shows, through the experiences of one woman, why women wanted and needed the right to vote, as well as other rights. It could have gone into more detail in certain areas, for example, a discussion between advocates for women voting and opponents, based on what were considered ""rational"" arguments of the time, instead of people yelling at each other, telling women to go back to their husbands where they belong, etc. Also, a little more background on the organization where the movement was based - it had a building with its name on the front, so it had apparently been around for a while, with Emma Pankhust as its leader. Also, why were the women learning self-defense and how, if ever, did they utilize it?"

",0.0,0.676,2020-07-06 00:00:00,8,"Watched this to better understand the feminist roots behind the Golden Age Wonder Woman (of which I am a super fan), I was not disappointed. A respectful, somber depiction of the first Wave feminists, the atrocities they suffered and the recognitions they asked for, perfectly in line with what William Moulton Marston wrote in his comics (no, WW didn't suffered just because of a fetish thing). Not entirely sure on one particular issue (the Gender Gap) being already a thing in victorian England, but whatever. Highly recommended.
Edit: Watch this instead of any garbage produced by WB and you'll have the definitive WW movie."

I think all college and high school students should see this, not only for the aspect of suffrage, but a look at turn of the century england/london.
One thing it is not: meryl streep really has a cameo; if you are looking for a streep film, this ain't it."
" Such an important topic -- Carey Mulligan is great in a grim film
",0.296,-0.9016,2019-11-30 00:00:00,7,"This grim historical fiction about the 1912 Women's Suffrage movement in the United Kingdom is elevated by an ernest performance from Carey Mulligan as protagonist Maud Watts, a twenty-four year-old laundry worker. Maud labors long hours at a thankless job with a vile, violating boss, then rushes home each night to her joy, her young son, George.While delivering a package, Maud gets caught up in a suffragette protest and later ends up being put on the spot to speak to Parliament when her coworker is beat up and deemed unpresentable. Maud's husband eventually evicts her for shaming him, and he quickly adopts out their son, George. Maud is also fired from her job.The set-up presents a woman - a symbolic everywoman - who has with nothing to lose, who gets involved in a fight for Women's Rights.Meryl Streep has a cameo as Emmeline Pankhurst, a leader of the Suffragettes who founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), with her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia. Pankhurt redirected her campaign from the ruling class to the working class, and when civil demonstrations did not achieve their goal, she called for violent protest.The film also stars Helena Bonham Carter, Anne-Marie Duff, and Ben Whishaw, who all give strong performances.Maud Watts and her compatriots are desperate, dedicated, bold women who became radical participants in the Suffrage movement in England in order to achieve the basic rights that were denied them. They held rallies, blew up post boxes, and got repeated prison sentences, where they staged hunger strikes and were force-fed. There is a cat and mouse aspect to the story: Inspector Steed, played well by Brendan Gleeson, tails Maud and takes photos of her and her compatiots.I was drawn to the film because of the topic. While I got swept up in rooting for the underdogs, it was difficult for me to feel supportive of the violence, yet one cannot imagine the conditions these women were in. I'm not an expert on the Suffrage movement in England, so this led me to read about the participants and their fight.Of the times, Emmeline Pankhurst said, ""The first time I went into the place I was horrified to see little girls seven and eight years old on their knees scrubbing the cold stones of the long corridors ... bronchitis was epidemic among them most of the time ... I found that there were pregnant women in that workhouse, scrubbing floors, doing the hardest kind of work, almost until their babies came into the world ... Of course the babies are very badly protected ... These poor, unprotected mothers and their babies I am sure were potent factors in my education as a militant.""The movie is good, not great, but I'm glad I saw it and grateful for women who fought so hard and diligently for equal rights. We have such a long way to go. I advocate for patient's rights -- the current medical system is rife the corruption that negatively affects men and women, but the widespread extent to which medical providers violate women's bodies and lives is shocking and unacceptable. Every story that depicts a human rights movement that is successful inspires me onward."

Votes for Women!"
" Gritty historical thriller
",0.1027,-0.3689,2019-11-16 00:00:00,8,"With great skill Suffragette ratchets up the tension in this highly polished historical thriller. The cops are after them, their jobs are on the line, and their husbands are rebelling against the rebels. It's really wicked, and unexpected. I expected a much less visceral depiction of women chaining themselves to railings before going home to cups of tea to argue with their husbands and write letters to Parliament. It's nothing like that at all, at least not for our heroine here. It's quite an eyeopener on life at the turn of the century too, as well as pulling on the heartstrings, and not just for their cause either. Great performances and all the bells and whistles in this transporting production. Do see it and be surprised."
" More Feminist propaganda
",-0.3134,-0.9897,2019-09-09 00:00:00,1,"In 1912 neither men nor women had the right to vote but by lies like this film we only here that women could not vote. The truth is women did have the vote, if like men they owned property. The vast majority of men who fought in the first world war did not own property and as such had no say in Britain going to war. They died to the tune of three quarters of a million. Hundreds of thousands more suffered horrific life changing injuries. Men fought to earn the right to vote. Women were given the right to vote less than a decade after their male counter parts. Suffragettes were nothing more than terrorists, setting fires to homes and public buildings alike. They were mostly middle class privileged women who tried to shame men who had been crippled by the war by giving them white feathers, a sign of cowardice as they saw it.I have nothing but contempt for this rewriting of history to make women inherent victims of male aggression and oppression. When by far men were the real victims and they were the victim of power, as it always has been for both genders.This film is not worth your time unless you like living in an echo chamber and like feminist reinforcement of the oppression narrative."
" Very Good
",0.4927,0.9527,2019-06-30 00:00:00,9,"Carey Mulligan takes a star turn as Maud Watts, a mother and laundress in the early 1910 in Britain. She gets recruited to become a foot soldier in the fight for womens voting rights.
There is nothing bad I can say about this film. Excellent production values, able, professional cast and subject matter that informs.
This movie illustrates why men should get out of the way and let women rule. Women give birth, raise children and work for pennies and still they love the men they choose. Men, who think their mothers, wives, sisters and daughters are nothing more than vessels to satisfy mens needs. It pains me that over 100 years after the period in which this movie was set that men still seek to dominate, dictate to and treat as inferior the women whom give life to us all!
See this movie with your favorite woman/women and show them you care."
" Tremendous Script, Sterling Cast Recreate the Suffering of Women
",-0.4767,-0.9537,2019-06-05 00:00:00,10,"Classic script, sterling performances brings life and reality to 1918 Britain and shows the anguish and pain women endured because they had no right to anything: money property, even their own children.. Britain, at that time, was a police state that did not allow opposition. Over 1000 women protested, some with dire consequences, to even get the right to keep their own children. Husbands had all the power -- and could ""sell"" a child (adopt it out) anytime he wanted citing the mother as a bad influence. This vividly raw picture is a story of a place and time that we never want to re-visit."

" A drab tale of women's rights
",0.0,-0.9381,2019-04-14 00:00:00,6,"The movie tells the story of a young married working class woman, Maud (played by Carrey Mulligan) in early 1900s when women were fighting for their voting rights in England through the Suffragette riots. It is a decent movie with good acting and notable cinematography which reflects its time in realistically and beautifully recreated London scenes. The brooding and dark look of the setting matches well to the somber theme of the movie. The story telling is good but not great. Indeed, the pace of the movie is a tad slow and sort of disengaging. After a few days of seeing the movie, I stumbled upon a documentary about the Suffragette movement and realized how closely the script stuck to the facts. While this certainly helps the producers to avoid any criticism for twisting the facts, it also renders the story a bit dull and devoid of passion.Perhaps, the biggest shortcoming of the movie was its inability of telling Maud's motives for getting involved in a movement that would drastically and tragically change her whole life. As a young mother, she had to endure a backbreaking labor under an abusive supervisor but so was her husband (and men of that time). Apart from the difficulties of a working class family of the time, she had a decent marriage with a little baby and a non-abusive husband who was sharing household chores, baby care etc. while going through the same difficulties of life -well except voting rights, although however much an important issue that would be for a person of his class (be a man or woman) is wide open to debate... Even as most of her peers and some other women were frowning upon the acts and tactics of the Suffragette movement, what made Maude so resolute to join a campaign which is hardly a concern to a woman of her class, while upsetting all of her life seems a bit contrived and incredulous. Indeed, this was never made clear in the movie. Moreover, pivoting the narrative on the focal point of a person who'd not normally be attracted to the Suffragette cause fails you to engage the story. The movie has some tension due to her broken marriage and the cat and mouse play with the police detective but the slow flow of the events struggles to sustain it at times.All in all, this is a movie that earns your respect and appreciation owing to its theme more than its entertainment value."
" Carey Mulligan ....
",0.0,0.4967,2019-04-10 00:00:00,10,"Carey Mulligan plays Maud, an impoverished laundry worker in 1912.She becomes increasingly drawn into the Suffragette movement through a work colleague and eventually participates in its more militant activities.Anne-marie Duff and Helena Bonham Carter play her closest fellow suffragettes.Once the prospect of protesting at a horse race attended by the king is broached, anyone with a sound knowledge of British history begins to realise a woman in the group often seen yet not as yet referred to by name will in fact turn out to be the courageous Emily Davison.We learn of the occupational abuse, police brutality of the time and just how much a patriachal society it was. At one point her young son is put up for adoption as a result of her behaviour and there isn't anything she can do about it.Watching Maud become emboldened is so inspiring. We owe those women a great debt."
" uninspired and disinterested
",0.0,0.6764,2019-01-11 00:00:00,5,"The best way to describe Suffragette is simply that its lifeless. It's unfortunate really, because the storyline is trying to portray enormously inspirational and important events. think the dullness can be attributed to two primary factors, the first being the film's obsession with it's time period. The best instances of a period being established are executed by allowing the characters and narrative to dominate the film, with the world being built simply being lived in. Constant eye-catching props from the period being shoved into the frame is obtrusive and distracting."
" Deeds, not words.
",0.0,0.7566,2019-01-02 00:00:00,7,"It's a telling point in history, that of the Suffragettes, the militant women's organisations in the early 20th century who, under the banner ""Votes for Women"", fought for the right to vote in public elections. So case in point that any filmic treatments are greatly anticipated - and wanted of course, so here we have Sarah Gavron's film that is written by Abi Morgan and starring Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter, Brendan Gleeson, Anne-Marie Duff, Ben Whishaw and in cameo Meryl Streep.Right off the bat it should be noted on two crucial points, one is that this is merely a story strand involving a group of Suffragette women, this is not all encompassing, something which is emphasised by the fact that Suffragette leader Emeline Pankhurst is only cameoed here by Streep. Secondly it has to be said that this is a condensed narrative for story telling emotional gain in favour of the Suffragettes, their more serious activities for attention are very much played down. So with that in mind anyone interested in the subject are urged to seek out literary sources for story as facts.Filthy Panks!The gripping story here dramatizes events that builds to the death of Emily Davison at the 1913 Derby. We are privy to the harsh realities of the life of women in this era (period detail superb), the employment pay structures, the treatment at the hands of the authorities, and the home lives that could result in losing ones child on account of poverty. It's potent stuff and ensures that we at least understand the need for change and fully support the women in their ultimate goal, the arguments put forward viable and just.Thankfully the makers are not on a one way mission to portray all men as monsters, there's a nice balance between good and bad. The implications of the women's long road to reckoning is given thought, the social distortion possibility hanging in the air alongside economic murkiness. So although the narrative often gets heavy handed in striving for dramatic impact, the point is well and truly made and begs all to delve further into a cause that ultimately needed winning.Small in scale as regards the Suffrage Movement as a whole, but important as an historical pointer and acted with professional assuredness by the cast, this achieves its goals regardless of condensement gripes. 7/10"
" A half-arsed attempt at telling half a story
",0.0,0.9936,2018-12-23 00:00:00,4,"1912 London and a young working mother Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) is a dutiful wife who loves her child and her husband. However, when Maud becomes friendly with a bunch of women who feel that women are as equally important to society as men and whom choose to do their best to give women the right to vote the women form a united front and do everything in their power to get their message across, but their journey is fraught with disapproval, hardship and tragedy....On a technical level this film is a success and ticks a lot of boxes; the era is well-captured, the acting is good and it does have a sense of worthiness about it. Unfortunately, it does struggle slightly beyond its technical prowess...I'm prepared to accept that the film does a reasonable job in capturing the women's struggle to be heard and also does a fairly good job as painting them as second-class citizens (which presumably was the point)... However...What it doesn't do so well is that it does very little to create a particularly balanced account of the Suffragette era; Meryl Streep appears as the great Emmeline Pankhurst but she is in the film for all of about 5 minutes and one wonders what the point of this was? Emmeline Pankhurst was the main person who was responsible for helping to get women the vote, but in Suffragette it basically reduces her to a cameo role and the ridiculous way she addressed everyone from a balcony made it look as though she was The Pope. To me it seemed ludicrous that the character of Emmeline Pankhurst was featured so little in a film about the Suffragete movement. It just didn't make any sense..I think what makes things worse than is that the film had no real sense of journey or purpose; sure it shows the hardship that was endured by women and director Sarah Gavron does a good job in getting us behind the women and their cause, but to me that's only half the battle and story. Why was their lobbying with Parliament glossed over and their struggle with Parliament and King George V all but ignored? Yes I'm prepared to accept that the film focused on the women's struggles, but it didn't focus all of its energy in the right areas resulting in a rather imbalanced, and at times rather poorly constructed film. It also doesn't help that the characters are rather thinly drawn which ultimately distanced me from the film resulting in me not caring as much for it as I perhaps should have done.Still to end on a positive, I thought Carey Mulligan was fantastic and I thought that she was well supported by the likes of Helena Bonham Carter and Anne-Marie Duff, but I still can't shake this feeling that Suffragette is slightly underwhelming and would have been better if we'd have had a director behind the project who was willing to tell the whole story"
" Never surrender. Never give up the fight.
",-0.3818,0.9516,2018-07-17 00:00:00,7,Meryl Streep played Emmeline Pankhurst in this film for a very short performance. The cast included Carey Mulligan as a suffragette in an unhappy marriage with a son. She is fighting for the right to vote. You would never think that there were rules to prevent women from voting in elections. The film tells the story of how the British suffragette movement and how they fought for equality. Meryl Streep does a very good job. The film cast is first rate with Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter were terrific onscreen. The entire cast was terrific but the writing could have been better. The film was set in 1912 and the art direction was first rate with the costumes and setting. Anne Marie Duff was great as Violet. Helena Bonham Carter played Edith. The film has some weaknesses in the storyline. The ending was satisfactory but left feeling incomplete overall.

",0.5859,-0.8987,2018-03-18 00:00:00,10,"Great film, well acted and surprisingly accurate though not based on an actual individual freedom fighter but an amalgamation of various heroines.Sadly women's suffrage has been widely ignored in education which is a great pity as these women were lionesses who in ancient history would have been feisty Spartan mothers. From the little I know about the torture, humiliation and brutality used against the Suffragettes this film captures some of the awful abominations like being force feeding nasally whilst on hunger strike. This happened and I was privileged enough to listen to a veteran Suffragette who was recorded by the BBC in the 60's or 70's describe her own experiences and the impact of torture physically and mentally she bore for her remaining years.I respect the Suffragettes in the same way I respect all abused groups who sacrifice everything for liberty at great cost to themselves, perhaps the soldier in me understands courage against overwhelming odds. These great women went on to lose husbands, sons & brothers in the carnage of World War 1 & to some degree in WW2. They helped win if you can call it that both World wars to despite how they were treated, I can't help but feel that that fire and determination was due to the Suffragettes & Suffragists.People have felt the film drags in places but I would prefer that to an action film. The cast was excellent and the scenery,costumes and sets were as authentic as possible.Great film now useless vile politicians both male & female build a permanent memorial on the empty plinth to remember the movement."
" The Fight For Women's Rights Has Not Received The Attention It Deserves
",-0.3818,-0.9384,2018-03-15 00:00:00,7,"For some unfortunate reason, when we think of the great civil rights movements of the past we tend to overlook the fight for women's rights. I have to confess - with some embarrassment - that I'm not especially familiar with the history of the suffragette movement on either side of the Atlantic, so I embraced this movie as a learning opportunity, and from that perspective it does not disappointment. It is the true story of the suffragette movement in England in the early 20th century, told largely through the experience of Maud Watts, one of its leaders. Watts worked in a laundry, was a wife and mother and had little interest in the fight for women's votes. But she gets introduced to the movement by Edith Ellyn (played by Helena Bonham Carter) and becomes more and more involved in it - eventually losing almost everything that had given her life meaning in the process. Watts was very well portrayed by Carey Mulligan. The piece of the movement portrayed here is a somewhat more ""activist"" group. They plant mail box bombs, the cut telegraph lines, they even blow up Lloyd George's house - being as careful as possible to ensure that no one gets hurt by their actions. They're hunted by the police, they're subjected to ridicule by the public and abuse by both their husbands and the authorities. But they continue on, fighting for the cause. The authorities here are largely represented by Inspector Steed (Brendan Gleeson) - who recognizes the difficult task he faces. He has to get the situation under control, and yet he has to avoid creating martyrs - because a martyr would ensure the movement's ultimate success.It's not particularly a fast paced movie. There are snippets of excitement in the first hour or so, but it isn't a movie that grabs you and pulls you out of your seat. It offers some background into the movement and the women involved in it. it's at about the hour mark, though, that the movie picks up speed, when it becomes clear how much Maud has lost by being a part of the movement. The movie picks up its pace at that point, and it leads us up to the climax of the movie - the thing that Steed had feared above all else: the creation of a martyr, in a shocking fashion that - being unfamiliar with the history of the movement - I was not expecting, although from what I've read since seeing the movie, the true motives of Emily Davison - whether she actually planned to become a martyr or not - aren't really known. The point is that she did, and her martyrdom lent impetus to the movement that eventually resulted in women receiving the right to vote.It's a very different world we're introduced to in this movie, where women have few rights and are basically the property of their husbands. At the same time, in the light of the #metoo movement of recent months, this movie also seems to have a social relevance. It's generally well done, and offers a look at the fight for women's rights in England. (7/10)"

",-0.5777,-0.0943,2018-03-13 00:00:00,10,"I was ashamed to be a man while women were mistreated, harassed, bullied, abused, denigrated, with most disregard for their well-being, how we men are so cowardly childishly and pathetically gripping dominance to feel of value, in control and safe, while completely blind to the fact that we'll be way better with women as our equal giving the emotional analysis and guidance that we almost completely lack, and that will lead both sexes to happiness, compassion, tenderness, balanced comfort and an enjoyable life, as they are experts on that as they have practice on their houses for millions of years; not giving them equal Rights is a huge detriment for Humanity, and as coward as you can be"
" A serious depiction of what the fight for a cause means
",-0.4404,-0.7775,2018-02-14 00:00:00,9,"This is not a movie for entertainment or enjoyment. There is nothing nice see or watch, not a lot of happiness (although there are sparks), and no whimsical characters who always seem to know what to do. It's the reality of a time that forces social change: cold, unforgiving, alienating, unsure, and demoralizing. There are no magic answers, and even the leaders are scrambling to know what's next. Even those supposedly fighting for change aren't necessarily expressing agency, they are sometimes left with absolutely no other option.All that said, the film manages to be compelling despite that it is a stark and dreary 105 minutes. It helps that the cast brings humanity to the characters, which somehow gives a string of hope through everything."
" Missing important true facts at the ending!!
",0.4559,-0.4664,2018-02-05 00:00:00,6,"Movie is representing the women's fight for their right of vote in Britain and we are well aware about Suffragette movement which was a real struggle. Great reminder of the past events, but unfortunately the ending text was not getting the facts right or as usual, smaller European nation is not mentioned as women in Finland got their right to vote in 1906, first country in Europe and the following year they had first elected representatives in the parliament in the whole world! Unfortunately the world seems to forget or is not informed correctly, but we Finns are proud of this fact."
" Predictable, but educational
",0.0,0.5927,2018-02-05 00:00:00,6,"SUFFRAGETTE is an acceptable filmed version of the Suffragette movement in Britain in the early 20th century, making sure to cover all of the main ground: the oppression faced by working women, the difficulty of working conditions, sexism, family relationships, the violence and rebellion of the Suffrage movement, the attitude of the authorities. It ends in the most famous event associated with the movement and as a whole is very predictable, but educational at the same time. I would have preferred this if the main character hadn't been heavily fictionalised and if we had a little more depth and layering, because as things stand this is very black-and-white in approach. Meryl Streep's cameo is too much of a distraction too. Still, the likes of Mulligan, Bonham Carter and Garai work hard to invest you in their roles, and it moves with a briskness and efficiency to keep it engaging."
" Compelling topic but lacking character depth
",0.1154,0.863,2018-02-02 00:00:00,6,"Oh, goodness. I REALLY was excited for this movie. The suffrage movement is so interesting and inspiring. It's a great piece of history and it's a ripe topic for a movie. But this fell a little flat for me. I felt like the characters - their motivations, struggles, strengths, weaknesses, regrets, etc - were not explored very deeply. It just kind of was an expose of suffrage moments but it wasn't anchored by that much heart. There was some grit and the historical elements of production were strong. But it fell a little short at the script level."
" Intense re-creation of events in London around 1912
",0.0772,0.9943,2017-11-22 00:00:00,9,"Like the film ""Jackie"" I reviewed recently, ""Suffragette"" from British Director Sarah Gavron seeks to achieve a necessary ""roughing-up"" of history made a bit too smooth (and hence unrealistic) by the passing of the decades. Without it, we are likely to add inappropriate refinement to pictures of actually-rather-demure-looking ladies in old sepia photos, with their smart-if-stiff-looking Edwardian-type clothes and such old-fashioned, even twee, names as ""Emmeline Pankhurst"" and ""Emily Davison"".This film will have none of that. Here are women - of various ages and (very importantly) various classes - boiling over with fury at the injustice they suffer, fed up with promises of enfranchisement that get nowhere. They struggle on at work for low (and lower-than-male) pay, give birth at regular intervals without much choice in the matter, face routine sexist abuse, are treated like property, pass most rights to their husbands as they marry, and just cannot stand it any longer.And this in a basically-democratic Britain that has long prided itself for the way it stands up for rights. Indeed, by 1912, male workers have won plenty of rights for themselves already, but now see it as convenient for the process to stop at that point.So here is a film whose main positive (if sadly mostly invented) characters are female; and since they are acted by the likes of Carey Mulligan (our increasingly radicalised heroine Maud Watts), Helena Bonham-Carter (as composite character Edith Ellyn) and a cameo Meryl Streep (as the real-life Mrs Pankhurst herself) - we have nothing to worry about in the sense of quality.Most male characters are not shown as clearly, and where they are, the light is often negative. (That appalling womaniser) Lloyd George in his pre-PM days is well done by Adrian Schiller, but he is as ineffectual (at this stage) as he is basically well-meaning. Maud's husband Sonny, played nicely enough by Ben Whishaw, is a basically-decent everyman entirely unable to distance himself enough to see that the woman he does indeed love deserves more than that. From the ruling class, the (sadly never-existing) Benedict Haughton MP (played by Samuel West) is willing to use fair means and foul to keep the lid on a growing rebellion that his own wife is a part of. And he is aided in this by Special Branch's Inspector Arthur Steed - the ""man of the match"" for this viewer at least, played with great deftness of touch by the ever-talented Brendan Gleeson. Steed is now deploying the first hi-tech as he seeks to spy on - and of course undermine - the plotting Suffragettes.And here we come upon a key point of the film, given that the portrayal of the activists here makes few bones about the fact that they are terrorists, actively encouraged into acts of terror by their leader. As it happens, nobody actually dies in the film - except for Suffragette Emily Davison, who famously ran in front of King George V's horse at The Derby (having been imprisoned on several occasions and apparently force-fed 49 times). Certainly injuries are sustained as the police wade into crowds of protesting Suffragettes. But the latter's activities could indeed have taken lives, and were certainly highly disruptive.The makers would like us to accept that the women were left with no other choice, but, though that case indeed has its historical merits, this same excuse has been used by (worse) terrorists a little too often for us to feel fully comfortable with the concept.In any case, the portrayal of London in 1912 is remarkable, and there is a great deal of squalor still present there - for men and women both, it might be added. Ground-breakingly, the film is also the first in history to be permitted to use true House of Commons settings - a testament to its great worth, and to the key historical events it portrays.Except that this is not purely historical. As the DVD's Extra Materials make clear, our film here was made with more than one eye on the fact that wage-differentials exist even in today's Europe, while basic rights are still denied to women in a host of countries right here and now in 2017.For this and the clear historical imperatives, ""Suffragette"" is simply a well-acted and skilfully-presented must-see."
" Movie sucks
",-0.3612,-0.0516,2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,Just another formula movie skip it.Meryl Streep is just phoning it in for another paycheck.People like Streep should just retire and change jobs.I think her political views are hurting her acting.She should just shut up and act.
" Better than I expected
",0.4404,0.9847,2017-02-21 00:00:00,8,"What a good movie this is, I wasn't sure what to expect but I was gripped from the outset. The set direction is superb and you really feel that you have been transported back to this awful time in history where women had very little if any rights. The story is one we all think we know but this movie reveals some surprises. Checking the history of this time it appears that this movie gets it right within the confines of cramming it all into under two hours.I though Carey Mulligan was outstanding as the fictional Maud Watts, who was clearly based on an amalgam of real characters, she captured her character brilliantly and showed a wide range of emotion as she became, at first reluctantly, drawn into the Suffragette movement.Meryl Streep has a very small role, almost a cameo, but she is as always 100% convincing as Emmeline Pankhurst. Helena Bonham Carter is also outstanding in her role and I found every character believable.Is is disturbing to think that the events in this movie took place not too long ago and it is sad to see that men used their positions to prey on women and young girls and treat them as little more than property or sex objects. The actions of the Police were particularly disturbing.This is not the type of movie I would normally watch but I can highly recommend it to anyone interested in History."
" Inaccurate
",0.0,0.875,2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"At the end of the movie, the claim was made that in 1920 women gained the right to vote in the United States. This is inaccurate. Only White women gained this right. Black women didn't get the right to vote until the 1960s. This fact should have been clarified. The film itself was okay. Not sure how accurate it was which is what you can expect with most ""based on true events"" movies."
