" The funniest espionage!!!!!!!!!!!
",0.6973,0.6351,2021-03-02 00:00:00,10,The funniest sequence is where Dwayne Johnson is shown in the shower!!
" Good
",0.4404,0.9876,2021-02-22 00:00:00,8,This movie is funny but funny and funny funny but funny funny movie is funny funny but and I enjoyed it.
" Slightly above average buddy comedy flick!
",0.4199,0.9835,2021-02-17 00:00:00,6,"(minor spoiler)Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart star in this buddy comedy that involves high school reunions, the CIA, wrongful accusations, bullying and being your own hero, or something like that. 'Central Intelligence' is full of clichés and predictable plot outcomes, but it's pretty much what I was expecting. A watchable comedy where Dwayne Johnson shows his comedic chops, and Kevin Hart does Kevin Hart yet again. It is okay, but I do tire of comedies referencing a movie or a pop group, and that movie or pop group appears, or is recreated at the end! 'Sixteen Candles' seemed to be the film of choice here. As far as a predictable plot, you can pretty much guess who the villain in Black Badger is when they show a prominent actor seemingly getting a bit part. It's all been rehashed and rethreaded in many films, and the buddy comedy has been done better in past films!*** out of *****!"
" Rock Fatigue?
",-0.25,0.9856,2021-01-16 00:00:00,7,"Nearly but not yet. As a recovering wrestling fan I am well familiar with the Rock and have enjoyed his foray into movies (mostly).However as he seems to be in every second movie being made at the moment I am 'starting' to get a little Rock Fatigue (I am writing this 5 years after the release date, so he has been busy since then).But as I mentioned the fatigue is coming but hasn't arrived fully. The reason I mentioned this is simply to say I wasn't exactly jumping out of my skin to watch this film.
So Central Intelligence was a pleasant surprise.Its funny enough, exciting enough to let me forget just how much Rock I have seen.So if you to are starting to tire then perhaps wait a while and throw it on when the world has a new flavour of the month.You will enjoy it :)"
" Very Funny
",0.4927,0.9115,2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"The Film in the complex is very funny, there are some good action scene, and also some twists and turns.
The combo Dwayne Johnson - Kevin Hart it's perfect have a tune that you don't see among other actors.
I recommend you tu see it!"
" It doesnt Work
",0.0,-0.9397,2021-01-03 00:00:00,2,"First of all i want to point out that i am not the biggest fan of the rock Movies.
They always were just bad or atleast mediocre. Mainly my Problem with this Movies are the comedy for me. its just so plain and bland and i only get one chuckle out of every of this movies. Theyre just so bland and unfunny. But with Central Intelligence
its a bit different. The film wants to go in two directions or would like to combine them: Action and Comedy, but it cant decide in which direction it will go. Sometimes there are only comedic scenes. But suddenly it tries to look like a serious action movie wich doesnt make sense and doesnt feel right. The Plot is not worth talking about and is just stupid. The acting is also quite bad. The rock isnt very talented and kevin hart likes to overact all the time. The Characters are just so bizarre, especially the rock and his past. But dont think its over: It even has stupid side characters who i dont care about!If you want a very dumb film go watch this the rock, kevin hart comedy
I DONT RECOMMEND!"
" So Average it's Bad
",-0.5809,0.9983,2020-11-03 00:00:00,3,"Central Intelligence stars Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart and is directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber who is best known for his work on We're the Miller's which was a 2013 comedy I actually quite enjoyed, however his latest efforts with this film proved to not be as successful. First off this movie is about Calvin, a former popular kid in high school turned bank account, and after realizing that his life may have peaked in high school, an individual from his past re-enters his life. I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, on one hand I was hoping for the best as I am fan of Kevin Hart's standup and Dwayne Johnson can be hysterical as well, but nothing from the trailer made me laugh and for the most part so did the movie.The jokes in the movie didn't feel all that clever and I felt as if someone sucked all the life out of this movie. It felt like completely soulless while telling its simple, straight forward story. Apart from its unoriginality I did enjoy the chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, I felt like they bounced off each other well, also one reoccurring thing that did make me chuckle a few rimes was how The Rock's characters would appear out of nowhere in certain places, I thought that that was cleverly funny. It's unfortunate this movie suffers from a tired story, as like I said before, the two leads did seem to have great chemistry, I would like to see the pair team up again in another comedy that would possibly offer a bit more laughs. Now this movie proved to me one thing I was afraid to admit and that is Kevin Hart's overexposure, he plays the same character in this film that he does in every other movie and honestly, it's starting to wear thin. Some of his quick quips are starting to get old/very predictable and as an actor he should be scared, no audience wants be able to predict how the punchline of a joke will go. Comedy is all about being unpredictable and spontaneous in the right context and sadly that is starting to fade for Kevin Hart. Overall Central Intelligence is just another cash grab of a comedy, that felt as lifeless as the next cheap comedy. I did not enjoy myself all too much and probably would have much rather have watched Ride Along because at least Ice Cube is pretty funny. I don't how much I'd recommend this film as it's something you have to see for yourself and honestly I just didn't really connect with the movie, with that being said Central Intelligence gets a 3/10."

" No 'intelligence' in Central Intelligence
",0.2263,-0.5145,2020-08-29 00:00:00,5,"Central Intelligence is an action comedy movie directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber and stars Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson, Amy Ryan, Aaron Paul and Danielle Nicolet in the leads.The movie is indeed not the best buddy cop movie and will be one of the many forgettable movie and may or may not disappoints you, the movie is neither a laugh riot nor the jokes and punches are humorous. The over zealousness of the pair will annoy you. The chemistry between the lead characters has no sparks and doesn't ignites.The story and the script is weak and the irritating performance is just adding the salts to the injury. It seems that the action scenes is the only saving grace of the movie. Jason Bateman impresses in his little cameo.The movie can be watched only once if you are a fan of cop buddy comic movies or if you are a die hard fan of any of the main leads."
" Good plot
",0.4404,0.9557,2020-08-25 00:00:00,8,"This is a typical Johnson movie, but nevertheless it is entertaining and has quite a good story to it.
Lots of humour makes it a good family movie."
" Kevin Hart is cancer.
",-0.6597,-0.5432,2020-07-16 00:00:00,1,Hart should not be allowed in movies. My dead grandma could act in circles around him. Same goes for Dwayne in all honesty. Some people do not deserve fame.

" I kinda liked it - just not entirely sure why
",0.0844,0.9815,2020-06-05 00:00:00,7,"I feel as if I should be hating on this film, but I kinda liked it - just not entirely sure why.'Central Intelligence' isn't the strongest attempt at comedy, it doesn't do anything particularly unique as it produces a lot of things you've seen before. The premise itself isn't entertaining, while a number of the jokes simply don't land.However, I still look back on this with somewhat good thoughts. The film surprisingly starts and ends with heart, which I didn't expect. Dwanye Johnson (Robbie) and Kevin Hart (Calvin) work well together, it is one of the weaker performances I've seen from Johnson; even so I appreciate him giving something slightly different from his usual. It's also cool to see Aaron Paul (Phil) and Jason Bateman (Trevor) involved.I believe, all in all, it's the likeable cast and unpredicted (minor) charm that keeps things ticking over to avoid everything dragging. Johnson and Hart have done better, though."
" Central Intelligence
",0.4767,0.7497,2020-05-12 00:00:00,5,"Despite a few scenes and exchanges of comedic value, Central Intelligence does it's fair share of recyled jokes. The plot is crazy, and non-sensical, and sometimes leaves a few holes. However, it's still a relatively entertaining action buddy comedy. Not horrible, but nothing special."
" Cliche, overdone - lazy writing
",-0.3612,-0.5274,2020-04-24 00:00:00,2,"One would think that with the star-studded cameos - the end product would have justified their compliance. This was not the case. Ie., the childhood bully character - please - offer your viewers some dignaty and at least try a little to make this char believable.I admit i made it through the whole movie withiut angrily changing the channel - but barely. And now I regret it."
" Movie makes no sense
",-0.296,-0.5719,2020-04-18 00:00:00,3,Theres no logic in the movie. Full of mistakes. It's about the story and more for kids i think.
" Next time let's aim for something a bit less trashy and lightweight
",0.0,0.9063,2020-04-18 00:00:00,5,"The Rock and Kevin Hart pair up as a set of dysfunctional high school acquaintances who embark on a quest for gunfights and fireballs on the eve of their high school reunion. The leading duo has a great rapport, funny without feeling forced, and it's a good thing because that's where all the magic lies; the plot is flimsy as all get-out. I understand, it's important not to overthink a dumb buddy comedy, and Central Intelligence brings a lot of amusing, brainless fun to the table. Sometimes it pushes a bit too far, though, and that's tough to look past. I'm talking about the watery acting (when they aren't ad-libbing, the two leads ham it up like a Christmas dinner), terribly awkward music decisions (shoehorned to fit the late '90s theme) and downright awful effects work (The Rock's face superimposed over a heavy-set teen is especially bad). There's enough meat here to merit another adventure with these guys - their social media promo clips for the film show they've got compatibility in spades - but next time let's aim for something a bit less trashy and lightweight."

",0.8399,0.9808,2020-03-30 00:00:00,7,Central Intelligence. True friendship is not a hindrance to a gun. Great comedy and which is a little action movie. Dwayne Johnson perfectly plays the role of a muscular and kind healthy man and Kevin Hart is a simple guy who will do anything in a difficult situation.
" Very cool film!
",0.4376,0.8481,2020-02-29 00:00:00,10,"I had a great time at the cinema (back in 2016). It's a very fun, action-comedy movie with a heartwarming core thanks to the very sweet character Johnson is playing :)There are 2 small details I didn't like. 1) With Johnson's character being actually innocent, the guilty smile & look he gave to Hart's character behind his back close to the end of the movie was out of character. And so the sole purpose of that smile was to trick the audience into still doubting about his innocence. I understand they wanted to keep the audience guessing until the big revelation at the end, but that was not the correct way. And 2) the real flashback scene between Johnson's and Aaron Paul's character during the revelation at the end felt cheap/weak, because Paul's actions were over-comical and thus unrealistic towards Johnson's character. They could have fixed that easily.Overall though, I can easily see beyond these details and as I said, I like the movie a lot and I like a lot that Johnson's character is all about stoping bullies!"
" Decent odd couple action adventure comedy
",0.3612,0.995,2020-02-12 00:00:00,7,"In High School, Calvin (Kevin Hart) was the cool kid that was destined to go on and do great things, everyone loved, and he was the ""Golden Jet"". Meanwhile, Bob (The Rock) was a fat kid that everyone made fun of and laughed at - there was nothing particularly wrong with him, but high school kids sucks.Fast Forward and Calvin finds himself in an accounting job which he dislikes, working with people that he dislikes; in fact the best thing in his life is that he married his childhood sweetheart. He's got a decision to make, does he go to his high school reunion, or more to the point, how do he get out of going? He receives a random friend request from what appears to be Bob. When they meet up Calvin is amazed to see that Bob is a musclebound hunk that, despite being a little geeky and naive, is confident enough to handle any situation in front of him. Before he knows it though Calvin is under suspcion of harbouring a dangerous criminal, a spy gone rogue, Bob! Who is Bob? Can Calvin trust Bob? Can Calvin escape Bob? Should Calvin escape Bob?This was actually a fun film, a bit predictable in places but still ok. I guess you'd class this as a buddy action movie with hints of comedy. It has some moral lessons hidden within the film and lots of feel good too. Hart and The Rock have a good chemistry, this isn't their first film together and it seems they are both able to bounce off each other. The film doesn't bring anything new to Hollywood but it is a good action film that doesn't require too much thinking - it's a sit back and enjoy film rather than a deep and thought provoking film. 7 out of 10."
" Opposite ends
",0.0,0.9427,2020-02-05 00:00:00,9,"Usually Kevin Hart plays the comedian and the rock plays the serious actor. But in this, it's the opposite. The Rock should definitely do more comedy roles. Their chemistry is excellent."

" Good Duo

" Kevin Hart is good, the movie isn't.
",0.4404,0.9108,2020-01-04 00:00:00,5,"Because I think they couldn't quite define a tone for the movie. That's why we go from ""Mean Girls"" to ""Naked Gun"", then maybe a ridiculous Matrix parody, just to be the next few minutes a pure action movie like Will Smith's ""Bad Boys"". And that roller coaster was just in the first act.In that sea of styles, the only that works all the time is Kevin Hart, possibly because his character is the only constant. I sincerely laughed with him and is the reason the movie is not a disaster because...Dwayne Johnson fails hard at portraying his schizophrenic role. His acting as a still childish special Intelligence agent not only doesn't feels realistic (not important in this movie) but also fails at being funny (with some exceptions). To be honest, he's just obnoxious.About the story: not really important. It's so ridiculous, it's irrelevant. The movie is not about anything. Kevin Hart saves it and makes it a brainless fun time."

As far as 'action/comedy' quality, this compares to the 'Bad Boys' films. At the end of the day, The Rock has such a charisma that he can make any film stand out a little. The self-deprecating and likeable nature of The Rock in this film may be the reason that we will, someday, see him holding an elected political position in the United States government. Wait!

Definitely not one of the enjoyable ones from The Rock's catalog.My biggest problem with this movie was Kevin Hart, I haven't watched many of his movies since when i have seen his work, it's always that hyperactive, screaming and self-repeating guy. It worked in Die Hard 3 when Zeus told John Mcclane that he wants's nothing to do with this plan (and them slurring insults to each other, it was funny,) but here, Kevin Hart seems to be repeating that line all the time when the action starts.
It grows old really quick, and then he becomes that annoying sidekick that won't shut up.After about halfway of the movie, he starts working together with The Rock, and the movie turns into a mediocre buddy cop-movie. Not much action to remember it by, some jokes are good, some not. Just overall a neutral experience. Run-of-the-mill movies that are ok to watch when nothing else to do or watch."

So it was pretty bad that I didn't think the Rock's character in this movie AT ALL. I don't think I laughed at one thing he said. Kevin Hart made me laugh a few times. But left me quiet a bunch of other times he was trying to be funny. The supporting cast was not funny at all, especially Kevin Hart's coworker in the office. And when they tried to get serious and give the story some meaning and depth, it was just so lame. I probably would've given it 2 stars if it wasn't for that (1 viewing)"
" Intelligence is in short supply
",0.4767,-0.6638,2019-06-26 00:00:00,4,"I remember enjoying this the first time I saw it (oddly, exactly three years ago to the day) at the AMC in Burbank but the second time around it did not have much charm.Dwayne Johnson plays a fat, bullied kid all grown-up into a CIA hardass but still retaining his teenage insecurities, with Kevin Hart his only friend who stood up to the bullies in his defence. It's a sweet dynamic and enough to make a movie out of on its own, but they try to make it exciting by having a dreadful spy plot and lots of pathetic action scenes that involve nothing more than people shooting and missing. It's so not committed to making the action memorable that when Johnson confronts a motorcycle assassin in an old warehouse the movie just cuts away to a different scene and it's never mentioned again even though they spend time establishing this guy as a credible threat.The quieter scenes are where this movie works best and even then the humor is already become quite dated despite 2016 being not that long ago. It relies too much on camp and stupidity, which is even more grating in the extended version as the extra running time is nothing but the lead actors ad-libbing out of control. It's not funny at all.A good idea was wasted with this movie. It looks cheap, it's badly directed, and in ten years, even five years, time it will be completely unwatchable. Johnson and Hart are capable of much better."

I believe that is a mistake, because after watching this funny, intense, and inspiring movie, I just want a second one. I want to see the story and friendship grow. I think the idea for it to be the next Rush Hour, or Bad Boys, or Beverly Hills Cop is a stretch, but I don't completely dismiss the idea. I think it could grow. I think there is a lot of potential in having Kevin and the Rock on screen! I hope they reconsider, because I would consider that to be a great movie on the directors part, as well as numerous others that enjoyed watching this film."
" Central Intelligence Review
",0.4767,0.9351,2019-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Fortyish accountant Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) was once the coolest guy in school, but now he's depressed with his middle management lot. That changes when the former geeky kid at school, now a CIA assassin (Dwayne Johnson), enlists his help.
Everybody loves The Rock, right? His skill at both one-liners and punching people through walls means an action comedy with his name above the title definitely pops the interest. Sadly, in Kevin Hart he's saddled with a co-star who, rather than bringing the belly laughs, is nigh-on unbearable, and a script that barely feels like it reached a second draft. As is sadly familiar, The Rock is the best thing in a deeply ropey enterprise.Hart's performance seems to be gunning for Joe Pesci in Lethal Weapon 3 in the irritation stakes.
It's a shame, because there's an inkling of a decent idea here. Twenty years ago Johnson's school fatty was humiliated in front of his entire year - his digital transformation into an obese teenager is quite something - and now he's turned his life around, lost the weight, and works for the CIA. The cool kid who comforted him - Hart - is depressingly aware he peaked in high school, and now hates his childless, professionally unfulfilled existence. The Rock bursts back into Hart's life out of the blue thanks to some vague spy nonsense, and in the film's sole interesting touch of reality the cool kid/fat kid dynamic from school is recreated in adulthood - despite Kevin Hart being the size of a table leg and The Rock being, well, The Rock. Central Intelligence's best moments come when this is stressed, with the nerdy, bum-bag loving chump persisting inside the man-mountain.That set-up suggests that character comedy was initially the goal here, but it's not what's resulted. We're sure not in the realm of intrigue: the central McGuffin - something to do with Hart, an accountant, being able to track transactions pertaining to stolen spy satellite data - is barely sketched, and the terrorist threat it carries with it makes no sense, unless Isis are headed to America via Zeppelin.Instead, we're faced with an action comedy where the action is so perfunctory it makes Cop Out seem like Heat. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber (Dodgeball, We're The Millers) has no form in this department, and it shows - this material needs an Edgar Wright, not a point-and-shoot journeyman.The comedy isn't up to much, either: scenes plod on and on with the slack editing of an Apatow improv-fest, only without the jokes. Hart seems aware of this, and tries to compensate by screeching his way through a performance that seems to be gunning for Joe Pesci in Lethal Weapon 3 in the irritation stakes. Dad jokes about Twilight and social media suggest the script sat on a shelf for a while: you can practically see the dust falling off the screen. Jason Bateman and Kumail Nanjiani do show up for welcome cameos, with Bateman producing a comic riff on his nasty turn in The Gift, and when they do you can feel the whole thing come to life - but it's only twitching on the table.An action comedy without any action or comedy - not even The Rock's charisma and enthusiasm can save this dud."

Who are the good and who are the bad intermix and even at the end the final scenes are very confusing
Everyone is shooting at each other and hurting each other in a way that does not look as through it's a set up and the bullets and totprture are real making it very confusing considering at the end everyone is friends between the two groups who were trying to kill each other throughout the movie
If that sounds confusing
It is
I'm still confused
Watching this movie made me feel like I was watching a poor copy of Shrek and Donkey
It did have some humerous moments but barely raised a smile
Would not waste my time on this one"
" Great Buddy Comedy with Cast
",0.765,0.9928,2019-02-02 00:00:00,7,"Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart have both surprised me with their movie discography. They have pretty good quality entertainment. Not anywhere near Academy Award winners, or nominees of any kind in anything, but they are very fun movies to watch and enjoy, a lot of them with family.This is an action movie that centers on an accountant and an insecure CIA agent. It's a fun watch if you love spy movies and action flicks in general. And Kevin Harts add a lot of sidekick comedy to it.Go see this. I can't say you'll be pleased, but I definitely loved it.7 stars"

" It All Depends On What You Like
",0.3612,0.9938,2018-11-14 00:00:00,10,"As with so many other films like this, I went in expecting to like it, but also prepared myself for the fact that it may be disappointing, as The Rock and Kevin Hart both often put out hit-or-miss films, but this one greatly surpassed my expectations, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.But I have to say, I was surprised at how much I liked this, especially since I ended up liking it more than I expected or wanted to going in. This really just looked like another raunchy, foul-mouthed, shoot-em-up movie that the 2010s so consistently produce, and while this film is no exception, it does all of the aforementioned elements with style. It really is just another fun, buddy action comedy that really soars because of the chemistry and gravitas brought by the two main stars.The story follows Kevin Hart as a high school jock/heartthrob who grows up to become a boring accountant who married his high school sweetheart. Dwayne Johnson was an overweight, geeky high school student who had one, embarrassing encounter with Hart's character, and he eventually reaches out and contacts Hart's character through Facebook years later. The two meet up at a bar, and they hit it off, but both realize how different the other is. It turns out that Johnson's character is a rogue CIA agent who was framed, and now he's running from his own people to stop the and guys and prove his innocence, but he needs Hart's accounting expertise to pull off his plan. What follows is a string of well-directed and edited action set pieces, along with often uproariously funny comedic moments, with some character development in between.This is a certain kind of movie for certain kinds of people, and not everyone will like it...not everyone has to. It really comes down to wether or not you like at least one of the two main actors, and wether or not you're ok with Hart's loud, at times obnoxious motormouth character who is unprepared for the intense, fast-paced action-packed scenarios that Dwayne Johnson's intense, likable character throws him into. If you're not a fan of loud, sometimes annoying, sometimes slapstick comedy, or over-the-top, fast-paced and occasionally brutal action sequences, then this movie isn't for you.There's a surprising amount of slick action in this film, although I shouldn't have been surprised since The Rock's in it. Several memorable scenes include the bar fight scene, office shootout/fight, garage fight scene, compound shootout scene, parking garage shootout, and final fight. I honestly expected less, but this film gave me so much more, and as an action fan, I was quite pleased. I often find that low expectations make for better enjoyment.About the comedy, this is actually a hilarious movie. I laughed out loud many times, and still do, when I rewatch certain scenes (they were that entertaining). The bar and airport scenes in particular still make me crack up, and I find that not many comedies manage to achieve consistently funny jokes throughout, let alone jokes that make you laugh just as hard upon rewatching them. Even if you're not a huge fan of Kevin Hart screaming and talking really fast, the Rock is funny and charismatic enough to make it watchable.This is the first Kevin Hart movie that I've seen, and I've only seen The Rock in one or two other films where he wasn't a main character, but if both of them are making movies like this, I would like to see more of them then."
" October Review
",0.0,0.7964,2018-10-26 00:00:00,7,"This movie is a Comedy filled with details and has a good storyline, the author starts in high school and moves into modern day life showing the changes inbetween. And the actors play there characters to a tee with a lot of emotion it seems like the character would have . Also the Movie has more of a Action feel due to intense moments in the movie with shooting and fighting."
" Another Great Comedy from Thurber
",0.765,0.98,2018-10-23 00:00:00,9,"Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock really puts on a great performance in Central Intelligence, as does Kevin Hart. The two actors play great off of each other, which is easy to see why they did Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle together. And the direction by Rawson Marshall Thurber is excellent, he really knows comedy. His last big comedy was Dodgeball in 2004.This film had a good premise though, two guys from high school catching up, who were really never close. There are a lot of cultural references to other films like the Bourne Supremacy and even references to Dwayne Johnson's own life (the fanny pack). This is a great film though, very funny, but not family friendly. If you're a fan of Kevin Hart or Dwayne Johnson, you'll love this film."
" Surprisingly funny
",0.6249,0.8836,2018-09-30 00:00:00,7,"The Rock rocks and is kinda adorable, may be because he is not a rock afterall. Hart is himself, they match good, I was surprised to watch it till the end and laugh."
" A fun mismatched buddy movie
",0.5106,0.9952,2018-09-27 00:00:00,7,"In 1996 two very different students were finishing high school; Calvin 'The Golden Jet' Joyner, a boy judged most likely to succeed; and Robbie Weirdicht, the fat kid whose life is made a misery by bullies. Twenty years later Calvin's life hasn't gone as expected; he is a midlevel accountant at a local firm... he is not planning to go to his high school reunion. Then he is contacted by 'Bob Stone', a man claiming to be a friend from school. They meet up and it turns out Bob is Robbie; no longer the fat kid but a towering man-mountain who swiftly deals with a group of bar-room bullies. Bob then asks Calvin to look at his accounts... it quickly becomes apparent that Bob is involved with some shady individuals... he claims to be after a man, known as the 'Black Badger' who is selling state secrets but soon the CIA turn up claiming Bob is the 'Black Badger'; Calvin will have to decide who he believes.This film provided a decent enough central plot which served up plenty of laughs. For a comedy the opening is a painful watch as we see Robbie humiliated in front of his school... of course this makes the inevitable payback all the more satisfying. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart work well together as Bob and Calvin; two very mismatched characters. The humour is fairly varied; on the one hand we have Dwayne Johnson, wearing a unicorn tee-shirt, talking about his favourite movie 'Sixteen Candles' and how he identifies with Molly Ringwald's character; on the other we get some fairly crude jokes that are pretty funny but will put off some viewers. The action is okay but is clearly played for laughs rather than thrills. The rest of the cast are solid enough; especially Amy Ryan who played CIA Agent Pamela Harris; the woman after Stone. Overall an amusing action comedy with the emphasis on the comedy."

",0.0,-0.5583,2018-08-21 00:00:00,1,"Why put Kevin Hart in this movie. What a worthless actor. It would have been good if he was not in it. Only screams, not funny, and is a scum bag."
" Not even nearly as bad as I feared
",-0.7717,0.9883,2018-07-31 00:00:00,7,"Despite being a die-hard fan of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, I didn't bother watching 'Central Intelligence' in the cinema. I just didn't like the look of it. It just came across as yet another tired spin on the 'mismatched buddy-cop' genre and probably all the best jokes were the ones featured in the trailer. However, after watching it, I'm actually quite surprised at how good it was. Actually, it is just another example of a 'mismatched buddy-cop' film, but, seeing as it had laughs and a high-entertainment factor, who cares? It was fun!The film opens twenty years ago during a High School finishing event where star quarterback (Kevin Hart) helps fat loser (Dwayne Johnson - courtesy of either one hell of a 'fat suit' or CGI effects) during some extreme public humiliation. Skip forward to present day and The Rock is now a super CIA agent and Kevin Hart works with spreadsheets. However, the pair meet up and inadvertently have to stop a major conspiracy from doing those dastardly things which will probably topple governments... or something. Do you care? Like I say... it's just fun.So, take one generic genre, add one generic plot and you may not be left with much. However, the charisma of the two leads elevates it to a great time if you're into some light-hearted entertainment and you're not expecting much. The jokes land and you won't care about the story much, as there's plenty of over-the-top action to allow Johnson to do what he does best.A couple of unexpected faces show up (unless they're featured in the trailer, or marketing in general - however, if you're like me and didn't know too much about the film - their inclusion was unexpected). And, as a massive fan of 'Breaking Bad' I would have liked their representative to have been in it for little more than just his extended cameo.There's not that much more to say about 'Central Intelligence.' If you're looking for something funny, easy-going and you're a fan of either/both Dwayne Johnson or Kevin Hart then you're going to have a good time here. On the other hand, if you're in the mood for something deep, meaningful and will blow your mind for its originality then you won't find any of that here."
" Funny
",0.4404,0.8963,2018-06-16 00:00:00,8,"This really is a surprising movie. It is well acted, and funny. While it is let down by Kevin Hart, Dwane Johnson shows he is a good comic actor, and is more than capable of carrying a movie. It's a couple of years old now, but is vastly superior to a lot of recent movies."
" A mediocre comedy that proved entertaining
",0.6597,0.8383,2018-05-29 00:00:00,6,"There wasn't much to this one and I am usually not a fan of Kevin Hart's screaming routine all the time. But in this movie it worked as he played a scared working stiff thrown into some crazy scenario.The jokes are mild but still kind of funny, like a ""hmm that is humerous"" vs. ""stop I can't stop laughing Imma pee my pants"".I am starting to become a fan of The Rock though. Last movie I saw him in was Baywatch and it was surprisingly funny. Also a mediocre comedy. If you go with this movie you could be making the biggest mistake of your life. Or the biggest good decision of your life. You ever play russion roulette? Time to spin the chamber Boris."
" Good chemistry
",0.4404,0.9979,2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"The advertising banner for this film - ""A little Hart and a big Johnson"" - is both clever and funny, and suits this action comedy.1996 saw Calvin Joyner as the big star of his year at High School, and voted Most Likely To Succeed. It also saw fat nerd loner Robbie Wierdicht humiliated when bullies throw him, naked, into the final assembly: the student populace laughs at him, but Calvin compassionately lends him a jacket. 20 years later, Calvin has married his high school sweetheart and Homecoming Queen, but finds himself in a boring job as an accountant. When a Bob Stone contacts him for a get together on the eve of the school reunion, Calvin is surprised to discover that the fat nerd has changed his name and become superfit. He is even more surprised to discover that Stone appears to be a rogue CIA agent, especially when he becomes involved, very much against his will, in a caper which is fraught with danger.The chemistry between Kevin Hart as Calvin and Dwayne Johnson as Bob is very effective, as is borne out by the very funny outtakes which accompany the closing credits. Importantly, notwithstanding a couple of inconsistencies in Bob's motivations and behaviour, both characters are fairly believable: Calvin never goes over the top in writing or delivery, and Hart is commendably restrained.The story, though familiar, is quite strong, and provides excitement of its own as well as a good vehicle for the action, humour and character moments. There are laugh-out-loud moments in this - there is a role-play scene in particular which had the audience in my cinema all laughing, not to mention the taser moments - and the film is just plain likeable.There are two cameos which work well, the supporting cast are all fine, and the two principals have fun and perform well.In a film which is fairly clear of toilet humour, sex, and innuendo, there is a single ""f*ck"" included, as seems to be the fashion, because F*ck. I find this really annoying, because it adds nothing.That aside, this is an enjoyable buddy movie with some good laughs."

It is your average action comedy, nothing special. If you are looking for a movie in this category, I would recommend Jumanji, Welcome to the Jungle. It is funny, having both Kevin Hart and The Rock, with a lot more story and character development. I liked, but not because it was anything exceptional. It doesn't have much re-watch value, but it is great to watch it once.

The film did well at the box office mainly due to them. The trailers did make it somewhat appealing yet also quite odd or bizarre. The comedy in this film is typical, there are some decent jokes and some misses that are not as funny as it could have been. Though what makes the film better than it should have been considering the recycled plot and predictable format, are Johnson and Hart, as their chemistry excels and they are both great entertainers. Central Intelligence blends both comedy and action and keeps it up but at the same time, feels quite bizarre and unrealistic at times with its over the top action. In a way, Central Intelligence is better than expected but also quite forgettable."

Unfortunately Kevin Hart, was, well Kevin Hart and as suspect actually ruined what could have been a good easy watching film. The role could have literally been played by anyone and probably played better by anyone, I didn't laugh once while Hart was on screen.Without Hart the film would have been a 6-7 rating. Unfortunately his presence and poor acting/comedic skills ruined yet another film and bring it down to a 4. Certainly not one to re-watch."

I haven't enjoyed a good comedy movie for a long time (and this was only because I hadn't had the free time)Honestly, this movie hardly deserves a 7. The plot has a lot of holes, Kevin Hart is overreacting about pretty much everything and Dwayne Johnson was not as convincing as I expected to.But it is only a comedy. Is there any comedy without plot holes? The main characters, Hart and Johnson have an unparalleled chemistry. And even with all that ""not so great"" acting, it is a funny movie.My best scene: CIA agents have Calvin (Hart) and Bob (Johnson) surrounded on every side. Calvin is inside a trolley which Bod holds. Calvin is terrified with his hands up. The CIA agents call them to put their hands in the air. Bob raises his hands and BOOM, out of nowhere his gun hits Calvin in the forehead. It's not a masterpiece, but a funny film!"

The Rock and Hart have great on screen chemistry and played off each other very well. I actually laughed out loud several times. The Rock who in high school was obese and got mightily humiliated in a huge and embarrassing moment and has later turned into a muscle-bound man and works for the CIA. Hart's character was the only one to not laugh at him and the two meet up 20 years later as The Rock needs his professional accounting skills to assist him on a mission. The plot is solid and has a few twists so above average for this type of comedy. Don't worry ladies, there are more than enough shots of The Rock topless and a long scene where he's in his birthday suit for your imagination only. Overall it was Fun and Funny."
" Rating: C+
",0.0,0.9984,2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"This is not a bad movie whatsoever, it's actually a pretty decent comedy with the main pro being the cast. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart have an amazing chemistry that can, not only be proved throughout the movie, but also at the end credits with the blooper reel. It really seems like a genuine friendship and that was the best part of the film: every time they were together I had a blast!I like Hart as a stand-up comedian and as an actor as well, even when he has those Kevin Hart's moments (high-pitched voice, screams, excessive gestures). Both him and Dwayne Johnson were good, but I struggled a bit with the last one: I didn't know if he was being annoying or actually kind of cool ... I guess it was a little bit of both, it worked for me, so nothing to complain here.The writing is OK, there aren't exactly moments to make you laugh until you cry, but it sure gave me some good laughs. The directing was also surprisingly good! The up-close action sequences weren't that nice, a lot of shaky-cam and abundance of cuts, but the chasing and shooting scenes were really great and cool to look at.The movie crumbles when it tries to introduce a more serious tone to the plot, which is already not that good. It's predictable, full of clichés and it didn't really captivate me. At one point the movie stopped caring about the plot and it was just trying to make something up so that Hart and Johnson could be together again.A huge mess is created while trying to explain the villain's story, Black Badger. First, everyone appears to be the Black Badger, since everyone exclaims ""No, I am the Black Badger"" successively in a scene (like, 2min of this constant re-iteration). Then, through flashbacks, the film tries to explain who it really is so many times when it didn't need any explanation and it made the last act of the film a lot more confusing.The ending has a very important message about bullying, but it could have been handled in a much better way instead of the cliché-type that kind of took the whole spirit out of it.Still, Central Intelligence has its good moments with the perfect chemistry between the two protagonists and, if they are able to remove the serious side of the plot without ruining it completely, I can totally see a sequel in a near future.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"

" Central Intelligence has positive aspects and negative aspects.
",0.4588,0.8957,2017-06-03 00:00:00,8,"This is an entertaining action/comedy. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart have great buddy chemistry. As a black person who has an individual mindset i like the fact that this movie exposes the narrow-mindedness of black culture, example there's a few lines delivered perfectly by ""Calvin"" (Kevin Hart) where he mentions that ""black people don't go to therapy"" and that he ""doesn't watch movies featuring Caucasians because he is black"", this type of mindset is unfortunately active in the black community today and has been for years, also as a Christian i like that this movie exposes Scientology for what it is, we see that when the bully now a grown man asks for forgiveness - it's a positive thing, and then the negativity happens as soon as he mentions he is a Scientologist, we see him being mean all over again.The negative aspect to this movie is ""Bob Stone""'s (Dwayne Johnson) reaction to bullies as a grown man, we see that he beats people to a pulp when they try to bully him, the line ""i don't like bullies"" is used to justify it, this film is not teaching people how to handle bullies the right way, violence isn't the answer, the line from 'Spider-Man' ""just because you can beat him up, doesn't give you the right to"" has a much better outlook on how to handle bullies. Central Intelligence is trying to have a lot of action scenes, but the shoot em up scenes is more than enough, the scenes where ""Bob"" is beating people up is not action at all, it's just someone resorting to the bullies level therefore becoming a bully himself, so the line ""i don't like bullies"" is actually hypocritical as he is now referring to himself.""Bob"" acting like an 8 year old in social situations and then acting like a serious action man in other scenarios is presumably because he doesn't have any social skills or he's trying not to give anything away being a CIA Agent.The scene where he spills a drink all over ""Calvin""'s computer was an interesting small scene, it's possible he actually spilled that drink on purpose due to ""Calvin's"" computer being tracked.Central Intelligence is one of those action buddy comedy flicks that is worth watching, once at least."

Probably more than I should have, but I liked the message the movie was sending. Allow me to elaborate. Synopsis: Calvin Joyner was voted in high school the guy most likely to succeed. 20 years later he's an accountant. As his high school reunion approaches, he tries to make contact with his old schoolmates. And someone named Bob Stone contacts him. He says that he was known as Robbie Weirdicht in school. Calvin remembers that he was picked on, as a matter of fact after an extremely nasty prank he left school. They agree to meet and Calvin is surprised by how much he has changed. Bob asks Calvin to help him out. He says yes and the next thing he knows some men burst into his home. They're CIA, the one in charge is looking for Stone, she says he's a rogue agent. When they can't find Bob they leave. Later he approaches Calvin telling him, he is not a rogue agent, he's trying to find a person known as the Black Badger who is planning to sell some information that in the wrong hands can be disastrous. So he needs Calvin's help to stop him. Calvin's not sure whom he should believe. Starring: Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart Director: Rawson Marshall ThurberThere is an epidemic going through the country right now and it's called bullying. This movie had one line in the movie that was said by Dwayne twice in the movie. ""I hate bullies."" That's what this movie is all about. Dwayne's character was bullied his entire life. He decided to change that. He changed himself so he could go against the bullies. That is why I am giving this movie an 8.Final Thoughts: I know I am not giving you much to go on except for the point of the movie. And that should be the reason to watch the movie.ntrRating: 8 out of 10That's it for me folks. If you would like to continue to follow my post, go ahead and like this page.

" we Americans love everyone we keep the whole world laughing
",0.8126,0.9951,2017-04-25 00:00:00,3,"Oh really, was this supposed to make us laugh? Sometimes I laughed, but that was more out of ridicule, of the acting, and lack of spontaneity from Johnson and Hart, probably because their characters weren't well designed either.Johnson only has a couple of mimics, like Schwarzenegger, maybe they had the same acting course. I always get the feeling he's telling me : Look here, I'm the Rock and I can be really funny. Well he can't. He's not a natural.Hart, its even worse. He's like a cheap clone of Eddie Murphy, who I couldn't stand either.Alright I admit, I don't like comedies, at least not that kind of brainless comedy. Jokes and funny scenes are so coarse, so primary. It's alright for kids though, and those who remained. Well there must be a lot of them in the USA, or else they would not have raised the budget.So what's a great comedy in this kind of style ? Ruthless People! That was funny, really funny, great characters, great comedians."
" Not bad, a great laugh
",-0.5216,0.9914,2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"Central Intelligence was a great experience. It was very funny, had great chemistry between the leads and a nice story to tie it all together. The film starts off with many laughs and is nonstop in delivering great comedy and a reasonable plot for the audience to follow and go along with. Aaron Paul also makes a great appearance and uses his signature phrase we all never get tired of hearing, you know what word. The Rock and Hart make a great comic duo in this spy comedy. Also who doesn't love a tale where someone turns their life around like the Rock did. The end where he turns his bad memory into a good one at the reunion was a nice touch.Definitely recommended."
" A warm movie with a good message trying to fight bullying that makes you laugh.
",0.2263,0.9749,2017-04-18 00:00:00,5,"Real-life lesson: You never know how long something you do or say to someone stays with that person. Being horrible to someone in high school can affect them through out their life. And you don't know how obsessed someone can become with you, you might not realise the impact you leave on people. Plausibility: The aim of this movie is not to be plausible so let's not get into it. Bullying affects people, that is plausible so let's leave it with that. Also overliking the only person that has shown kindness to you also is plausible. Storytelling: Slow at the beginning but takes off well. Has its interesting moments when you don't know if Bob is a good or a bad guy. Character development: Jet is the only one that develops a bit realising that his life is not a failure. We already know what motives Bob and what has affected him and make him who he is so much character development is not needed.Acting/Casting: Both are amazing and have an amazing chemistry. At the beginning I feel like the rock had a bit trouble portraying this goofy warm hearted kid even after 20 years but it gets better towards the end. Overall, a warm movie with a good message trying to fight bullying that makes you laugh."
" Big Hart
",0.0,0.875,2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"Central Intelligence sees a high school fat kid Rob Wierdich who is humiliated at his last day in school being transformed into muscular but timid Rob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) who is now a CIA operative.Twenty years later and with a high school reunion on the horizon Stone hooks up with Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) the star student known as the Golden Jet and the only one who came to Wierdich's aid. Joyner's career as an accountant has not been as stellar that high school promised but Stone wants to use his skills to decrypt some financial transactions. The agency thinks that Stone has gone rogue and are out to get him.This is essentially a buddy action comedy. Hart is actually the straight man, leaving the light goofy comedy to Johnson. They make a good team but the plot is too formulaic and unadventurous. Still the offbeat characterisation from Hart and Johnson makes this film amusing enough."

Thinner with terrific muscle tone, he is a CIA agent and as we come to realize, the most popular guy who feels that his life has been a disappointment, soon gets caught up in an espionage caper thanks to our now well-trimmed guy.The film is a good one as it becomes a guessing game on who is to be trusted or not.

" A decent film hijacked by ""Kevin Hart""
",0.0,0.9169,2017-03-18 00:00:00,4,"This film has a plot which, if made as an 18+ film with bullets actually hitting people and people actually dying in a 'CIA criminal bad-ass movie' (which would be the most common thing occurring), has potential.However, the same tiring ""Kevin Hart"" brand of 'look how short I am' jokes and over-exaggerated off-topic ranting (as if it was a stand up show), ruins it. Seriously. As a result, the whole production panders to it. Cheap and repetitive. If you want to watch Kevin Hart attempt to act but end up playing the same character he has always played in any (comedy) film, creating the same mind numbing content to satisfy people with a single digit IQ then go ahead. You'll love it."
" The Rock
",0.0,0.6597,2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Dwayne Johnson plays the part of an overweight fat high-schooler who is embarrassed in front of the entire school. A number of pranksters get him in front of the audience completely naked. He is saved by the all-athlete all-academic Golden Jet. Fast-forward 20 years into the future and the top athlete/academic student is an accountant when the Rock comes into Kevin Hart's life. There is a mix-up of operatives in the CIA and the case of international monies. The situation is bizarre. Kevin Hart's character has to choose who he believes – the Rock or the CIA. It is a good, funny movie."
" the Rock is off his game

He gets in touch with fellow high schooler, Calvin, played by Kevin Hart. Calvin was voted most likely to succeed, but is stuck at a boring job. He meets Bob for drinks and is shocked what he's turned into. Even changed his name. Other CIA agents are after them, thinking Bob has turned treason. They solve the case but still have the 20 year reunion to go to. Both of them get all the attention and Bob meets his high school crush, Melissa Mccarthy.FINAL VERDICT: OK, had some funny pars, but not the Rock's best comedy."
" An enjoyable but slightly bland Comedy
",0.5835,0.9958,2017-03-15 00:00:00,6,"Central Intelligence follows Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart), a once popular high schooler, who twenty years later works a dead end accounting job, is having small marital issues, and is unhappy with his life. Calvin receives a message from an old peer Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson), who was overweight and bullied in high school. Calvin agrees to meet with him, as an impending high school reunion approaches and he worries about what people will think of him.Stone, however, has changed drastically in many ways. Although still awkward and weird, he is now fit (this is Dwayne Johnson we are talking here). Calvin and Stone go out for beers, but Calvin begins to suspect something isn't right when Stone asks him for help with some odd accounting abnormalities. Soon, the CIA is hunting Calvin and Bob as they race to stop a nefarious plot, and Calvin can't decide whether he should trust Bob Stone, or trust the CIA.Central Intelligence was a fairly enjoyable film in many ways. I personally really enjoy Dwayne Johnson as a modern action/comedy star. He continues the trend set by Arnold Schwarzenegger, as a goofy but lovable action hero. Hart was also adept in the film, offering good bits of comedy, and some good acting. Unfortunately, the characters in the film are one dimensional, and not fleshed out well. Johnson's awkwardness seems forced and awkward in itself. Hart is often useless and listless in the film. Many of the side characters suffer from similar lack of character.The film itself was fun, and had some good humour in it. As previously mentioned, I enjoy Johnson in film, and find he has great on screen charisma and tact. The film was carried throughout by his acceptable comedy performance, and some over the top action scenes. However, some of these scenes were certainly forced, ridiculous or cheesy to the point of disbelief.This film was a mixed bag, as can be scene. It is an excellent ""popcorn"" film, with little substance to it, but one that will offer a few laughs. It never feels boring or contrived, and is perfectly watchable throughout. However, weak characters, a weak plot, some petty comedy and some poor action result in a mediocre film. Johnson carried the film for me personally, but this will certainly not be the case for everyone. This film is viewable and fun in certain instances, but offers little else of value. A weak 6/10."
" Superb with Slight Fix
",0.6249,0.9878,2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"The movie is certainly a classic family fun in my book. I think the movie was put together very well and carried out well too. The only issue that it had was Kevin Heart. I do not think he was a perfect for the movie. He fit in well with the character in certain areas and expectations for what he filled, but he is not a seasoned actor. His stand-up comedy seemed to mix in with his lines. Whether the lines were intentionally written or not, it was a huge draw back. For the character I would have preferred to have Will Farrell, or Chris Tucker. I think for similar pitch without the drops, both actors would have picked up very well. I have to note that Dwayne Johnson played superb in the movie. His character is very hard to fill, not sure if it was intentional or not, the character came out as a genius, mixed with ignorance or clueless appearance. This made the movie much more of a comedy than a thriller. His character definitely fit well. The Rock is definitely one of the marvels in Hollywood."
" Central Comedic Perks in this one pairing Johnson & Hart
",0.4019,0.9341,2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I did not think that the comedy ""Central Intelligence"" was going to be under the covers of a surprise enjoyable flick, but it sure was. Dwayne Johnson stars as Bob Stone, a former paunchy punching bag target of high school bullies; who years later becomes a musclebound CIA Agent. Kevin Hart co-stars as Calvin Joyner, a former high school athletic phenom who years later is displeased in just being a straight laced accountant, which in reality it calculates to a decent living. Joyner and Bob (in high school, Bob was known as Robbie Weirdicht) were not the best of friends in high school, but Joyner did help that Weirdicht in an embarrassing ""all dicht out"" left-in-the-nude prank on Robbie that was orchestrated by nasty high school bullies. Weirdicht, now a Rolling Bob Stone, never forgot Calvin's graciousness and reaches out to him to help Bob in a CIA case where he is being semi-framed. The plot is not the central intelligent point of ""Central Intelligence""; its rather the clicked chemistry between Johnson and Hart; and most notably Johnson's uproarious comedic performance that simply (what's the word?)... rocked!!!! Director Rawson Marshall Thurber did not manufacture a complex narrative, and that was not his intent. Thurber's direction of the Joyner & Stone interactions is what made him a Thurber King in helming the picture. So I rest my ""Central Intelligence"" case, and I suggest you should investigate it for yourself, you will be pleased. **** Good"

The beginning of the movie was pretty good but then after the build up it really just got dull and boring and the ending was not all that great either. I mean with the caliber of fire power you have with the actors that movie should had been funny throughout but it really got annoying with Robbie Weird Dick(Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson) trying to be too funny by acting a little weird."
" Hart misses the mark again
",-0.2263,0.9979,2017-02-19 00:00:00,4,"For a comedian who has yet to show good form in feature films, Kevin Hart is certainly laughing all the way to the bank, as the hugely successful American stand-up comedy master has yet again with Central Intelligence hit pay dirt, even though his feature length material fails to add up to anything more than an experience that provides a few chuckles but missed the mark badly in concerns to story and hearty, memorable laughs.After big roles in films like Grudge Match, Ride Along, About Last Night, The Wedding Ringer, Get Hard and now this film, Hart is stringing together quite the list of mediocre films that have failed to capitalise on whatever charisma the performer seems to possess that has made him such a drawcard in the American marketplace.Whereas comedians turned movie stars like Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler found initial success in their transitions to the big screen, Hart is walking a tricky line of never achieving the success many of his counterparts have found with their films that still manage to entertain to this day and not even the teaming up with Dwayne Johnson here can bring out the laughs like it could've.No stranger to hitting comedy high notes and seemingly a fan of partnering with Hart (the two performers will next be seen together in the Jumanji remake), Johnson gets some easy laughs as high school fat kid turned Jason Bourne like super spy Bob Stone who reunites himself with Hart's one time High School kingpin turned sad-sack accountant Calvin Joyner but Dodgeball director Rawson Marshall Thurber never finds the right balance needed to make Central Intelligence truly take off and while the film even tries its hand at some uneasy action sequences, even at 100 minutes Central Intelligence feels like a joke that wears out fast, after the initial funnies of The Rock with a bum bag and unicorn t-shirt wears off.Appealing to the somewhat low common denominator that modern comedy audiences have sadly come to know and love, Central Intelligence isn't the worst comedy you'll watch this year but it's still a long way off being much more than a background diversion, future TV re-run big shot and another forgettable entry into the increasingly disappointing Kevin Hart feature film catalogue.2 Sixteen Candle screenings out of 5"
" Great movie!!
",0.6892,0.9383,2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"I gave it an 7 only because of the office scene where Agent Stone is 'attacking' the agents' butts in the office scene....only to find out what the ending was which discredits this whole scene. Also, in the scene where Agent Stone spends the night at Hart's place, the wife is nowhere to be found that night or the next morning. she should've been home right? Even if she was still sleeping or in the shower, she would have known when all the agents came swarming into and searching the house.But, overall, it was full of twists and hilarious!I really enjoyed this one. Roles were well done and the movie had an AWESOME, encouraging message for everyone to take to heart!"
" 'Central Intelligence' is the movie the world needs right now.
",0.4767,0.9974,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"What would a Summer-Movie-Season be without Kevin Hart and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson? This summer, the two team up in an action-comedy called 'Central Intelligence', directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber ('Dodgeball' and 'We're The Millers') and co-written by actor/writer Ike Barinholtz ('Neighbors'). With so many buddy-cop action comedies out there, it's sometimes difficult to tell one of them from another. Sure, there are the greats like 'Lethal Weapon', 'Turner and Hooch', and 'Tango and Cash', but what does modern day buddy-cop action comedies hold that the past films don't? When relating this to 'Central Intelligence', it seems like the filmmakers thought it would be a lot of fun to put these two personalities together and basically let them riff off each other for a couple of hours. Throw in a some guns and a half baked plot about world security and terror, along with a message about being bullied, and you have yourself 'Central Intelligence'.This film doesn't really pay attention to much with the actual plot at hand here, but more or less has Hart and 'The Rock' running around in comical scenes with some action to move the so-called story along. I know that doesn't sound great, but the chemistry and comedy between these two is quite funny and charming all at the same time. It's this only aspect that makes the film watchable and thoroughly enjoyable. You've seen better action scenes before in other films and you've laughed harder elsewhere too, but when these two actors come together, they make for a hilarious duo. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a sequel to this at some point.The film starts out back in the mid-90s where Calvin Joyner (Hart) and Bob Stone (The Rock) are in high school. Calvin is the star of the school and is involved in everything from sports to theatre and is most likely to succeed. Bob Stone is a fat kid with braces who loves John Hughes and sings in the public high school shower. After a major embarrassing incident in the middle of the whole school, Bob is truly defeated and Calvin is the only one who helps. Cut to present day where Calvin is unhappy with his mediocre accounting job and Bob Stone is now 'The Rock'.Sooner than later, bad guys and even the CIA are gunning for Bob Stone and Calvin now, and you never know if Bob Stone is an enemy of the state or the good guy, but none of this really matters here, as an excellent field of cameos pop up and the jokes between The Rock and Hart are almost endless, with the exception of when Calvin is trying to decide if his old friend is trustworthy. Again, 'Central Intelligence' isn't the ultimate buddy-cop action comedy, but it certainly has its moments. There are a ton of movie references, some solid comedy, and 'The Rock' wearing a unicorn T-Shirt. You just can't get enough of that silly fun. Stay tuned during the credits for outtakes.RECOMMENDED!"
" Huge let down.
",0.3182,0.7944,2017-01-20 00:00:00,2,"I was very disappointed that The Rock's character didn't actually turn out to be ""that cool guy,"" the trailer was misleading in that regard. I just thought his humor/character remained weird and uncomfortable. The Rock is a really funny actor but this movie just didn't let him do that, and it was almost unbearable to watch his talent go to waste. Kevin Hart was great but I've just seen better characters from both of them. Just unfortunate. The reality that his character didn't evolve as much but just became better looking may just be the point that sometimes that happens, and that that's okay is fine by me. It doesn't fall under the stereotypical movie that suddenly he is the coolest person. I just wasn't hoping for that to be the case. I'm not positive what I would have done differently to make it closer to my vision."
