" HOLLYWOOD IDIOTS
",0.0,0.4553,2021-04-12 00:00:00,1,"Really come on WHY WOULD YOU DISTRO THIS FILM HOLLYWOOD AND ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN REALLY.Come on ANNIE IS SHORT, WHITE, WEARS A WHITE AND RED DRESS, SINGS THE SONG ""TOMORROW TOMORROW"". AND OTHER SONGS. RED CURLY HAIR AND A BROKEN NECKLACE. OH AND A NICE BIG CHUBBY DOG.OK I am NOT a Bigot or anything ANNIE was NOT BLACK. Oh and the Man that was going to adopt her. Was Old Fat and Bold. Plus the Lady at the ARFANE AGE WAS A OLD DRINKING LADY. That was in her late 40s or 50s. She was NOT A HOT LOOKING CHICK. This New Film was TOTALLY GARBAGE. SHE LOOKED NOTHING LIKE ANNIE. ANNIE WAS WHITE NOT BLACK."
" I liked it. Jamie Foxx saved a Girl's life
",0.6808,0.9514,2021-04-09 00:00:00,10,I really enjoyed the movie. It was really good and cute. Seeing Jamie Foxx save the little girl Annie from almost getting roadkill and from danger. I loved seeing the relationship between them.Also She was being abused by that mean White drunk Foster lady along with those other girls I felt bad for. She wanted to see her parents but turned out they weren't her actual parents towards the end of the movie.That part when She straight up told Jamie Foxx to his face your not my Dad hit me hard then at the end still forgives him. I recommend this movie.I loved it!10 stars.
" I don't understand all the hate.
",-0.5719,0.9885,2021-03-16 00:00:00,8,"Sheesh--It's almost like people were paid to leave bad reviews. I love every Annie production, whether Broadway, movie, or made-for-TV. And I own all the soundtracks. I think each production brings its own unique spin. I'm not sure if it's a racial thing or not (that would be disheartening), but as a white person, I enjoyed seeing a fresh take on the classic. It's nice to see a male POC being a successful businessman. And the new and updated songs by Sia are so catchy and singable. I found this movie to be touching and relevant, not to mention delightful. Yes, am I a little annoyed by the ""closure"" to the search for Annie's birth parents (oh, well, shrug our shoulders because we just can't find them anywhere), but it doesn't detract from my enjoyment. Yes, it's a little campy and it won't win any Oscars, but I thought the actors did a great job, and I thought the direction was handled with finesse. This is definitely one of my favorite movies."
" Underrated
",0.0,0.9423,2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I first saw ""Annie"" in the theater. I've seen it quite a few times since. It's an easy watch that always hits the spot. The movie looks great. The cast is good with standout work by Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx. Foxx gives a terrific performance in this movie. I think that more people should give this movie a shot. It's a lot better than its reputation."

" Loved It
",0.5994,0.9894,2021-02-16 00:00:00,9,"I am someone who hasn't seen the earlier versions, because aside from the song, they didn't appeal. I wasn't hopeful I would enjoy this version. But after a few minutes I was engrossed. I loved Quvenzhan√© Wallis as Annie - she has pizzaz !The costuming and set decorations were super and I thought it was well cast. The storyline and songs were great. The singing ability of the actors was fine - it suited the movie and gave it a ""down to earth"" appeal.Sure there are a few holes in the plot, and some parts could have been done differently, but does that really matter? It's a movie meant for enjoyment. Take it for what it is, without comparing it to earlier versions.I'd especially recommend it to those who aren't familiar with the originals."
" Why?
",0.0,-0.4588,2021-02-11 00:00:00,4,There was zero reason for a remake other than them trying to make some kind of point. This movie was awful
" Loved it
",0.5994,0.96,2021-02-08 00:00:00,8,"The original Annie was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid. I tried to show it to my 5 year old daughter, and she was so bored she could barely sit through it. I gave it six months and showed her this version. She LOVES it!! I thought it was charming. No movie made for kids will be free of cheesiness, but for what it is-a kids' movie-I thought it was pretty adorable. I like the modernized versions of the songs, so much so that I think I actually prefer this version of It's the Hard Knock Life."
" Good

I'm not saying they're wrong, but I honestly think they should have said this was ""inspired"" by the original Annie movie. I really like it, and I think it's good. But, it's not the greatest movie ever."
" A sacrilege to my favorite musical movie
",0.4588,0.9803,2021-01-17 00:00:00,1,"You know what needed to be remade? Annie. But not just any remake. No, it needs to be a modernized, hip hop infused remake that focuses on materialism. Well, if that's exactly what you wanted, that is exactly what you got! The bad thing is, this is exactly what Annie didn't need. The modernized take on Annie follows an orphan who has a chance meeting with a billionaire mayoral candidate, but that meaning changes both of their lives. This remake falls into the category of pointless. The original from 1982 and even the Broadway musical from 1977 are more than enough, and the original can be considered a classic of sorts. Well, the film has been made, so its time to break it down.For starters, the acting is subpar. The opening scene mocks a redhead and freckled girl representing classic Annie who does a joyful tap dance to rolling eyes in front of a modern classroom. She then gets booted off stage for being ""uncool."" Enter Will Smith's replacement ""Annie"" who then takes over and of course the class loves her because she's into hip hop culture and ""cool."" The child actors are expectedly bad, most of the adults are given nothing to work with, and then there is Cameron Diaz as Ms. Hannigan. There is absolutely no excuse for how horrible she is. She's just too nice, pretty and bubbly to play a heartless woman. It was like she put up a ''bad break-up'' mood to act cruel, and it didn't work. You cannot put a friendly-faced actress to perform as Ms. Hannigan: in the original, Carol Burnett nailed perfectly into the part. This is a poorly written film that bounces around all types of tones, with pacing that moves things quickly until the musical numbers kick in, which feel very out of place and bring things to a screeching halt. Which brings us to the music... The film ""modernized"" the classic songs by changing the beats of the songs to a faster tempo hip hop beat. If it sounds pointless, its because it is. By the time the credits do roll, there isn't much that sticks in the mind except one insanely horrible performance.Nothing more to say, if you're gonna make a black Annie, you might as well fully commit and make all the originally white characters, black, just saying. ""The Wiz"" (1978) it's a good black rendition of ""The Wizard of Oz"". And don't come with nonsense like racism or anything like that.PS: If you liked the performance of Cameron Diaz as Ms. Hannigan, go watch ""The Mask"" instead."
" Mediocre
",0.0,0.6249,2021-01-02 00:00:00,1,"When will these remakes learn. Dont try to get cute, the material is already there. Don't need to try that hard. To fit personal agendas."
" A different spin on the classic musical
",0.0,0.4404,2021-01-01 00:00:00,5,"Annie is a somewhat remake of the 1980s musical and stars Rose Byrne,Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz(in her final acting gig). The movie replaces the red curly heroine with a black African American girl who lives in the orphanage with Miss Hannigan(Cameron Diaz who I swear is morphing into Michelle Pfeiffer). Of course one day she gets to stay with an African American man (Jamie Foxx) and his assistant(Rose Byrnes). Will she or won't she stay with him in the end?
Jay Z and Will Smith served as Executive producers for this film. Sia appears too."
" It's not a 1 star..
",0.0,0.976,2020-12-21 00:00:00,3,"Uhh, so it came out in 2014 but I'm rewatching it and decided to come see it the reviews reflect how I feel about it.The target audience is definitely children, it's much harder in my opinion for anyone with an actual concept of what is good and bad to enjoy. I've noticed that with modern films or TV shows, a lot of the time child actors REALLY over-act, which is what happens in this film, a lot of mediocre drama-kid acting; which I guess annoys me since you'd think as we improve with time, that the standards of acting would also improve or at least.. Not stoop too low.
It's also weird how with modern movies we just NEED to auto-tune singing, and badly at that. Why not just hire someone who can actually sing? Just listening to this new rendition of 'Tomorrow' makes me wince.
Any warmth and spirit seems to have been sapped out of the movie with it's new modern setting, everything comes across as being really superficial, and even though the characters are nice, you never get to the point of really liking them.I'm giving it a 3 because the movie does still have structure, the characters are consistent throughout and there's no continuity inconsistencies.. But then again, all their key story points have already been laid out for them with the original Annie."
" Poor, all in all
",-0.4767,0.3772,2020-11-30 00:00:00,5,"Not for the lack of effort, but 'Annie' isn't good.I've admittedly never seen the original musical, not that I think that's necessary anyway. I like the cast, while the songs are alright - if cringey. Everything else is either slow, predictable or straight up boring. It might've, perhaps, worked better as a flat out drama - though then they'd get hate for changing things, I guess.As noted, the onscreen talent stopped this from falling far down my ratings. Jamie Foxx and Rose Byrne are two actors I enjoy, I found them satisfactory in this - could've been better, could've been worse. Quvenzhan√© Wallis is more than decent in the lead, while David Zayas is solid.Cameron Diaz is, however, truly awful - and that's coming from someone who likes Diaz; she's very good in films like 'Shrek', 'Knight and Day' and 'Bad Teacher' but this is certainly the worst I've seen from her - it's a shame that she went out with this as well as the dreadful and overall inferior 'Sex Tape'.Despite me rating (most of) the cast themselves, I don't think the casting itself is anything praisable. Foxx, Byrne and Diaz are not three actors I'd immediately think of if I was making a musical - a few of their songs are a tad ropey.Poor, all in all."

",0.0,-0.8098,2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,"Did Sony really think reboot a classic movie about a red-headed orphan was gonna be great? Hell no! After seeing the 1982 and 1999 versions they announced a reboot of Annie and I was like okay! When I went to get it on DVD, I was very disgusted with this film. I am disgusted with the characters (Except Cameron Diaz's role as Miss Hannigan, that guy at the bodega who likes Miss Hannigan, and some minor characters) I had wasted over $5 to buy a dvd of a bad movie reboot.
The plot is about a bratty and spoiled 10-year-old named Annie Bennett (Quvenzhan√© Wallis of the award winning film Beasts of the Southern Wild; 2012) who lives with other very annoying girls in a foster home ran by the former super star now alcoholic Miss Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz of the mixed to critically panned 2000s Charlie's Angels films, and Shrek; 2001) who is actually likable without the alcoholic issues. This is Mrs Diaz's final role in film before retiring in 2016. After saving a dog from some kids who were randomly added as extras. Annie almost became road kill by William Stacks (Jamie Foxx of the Jamie Foxx Show and Beat Shazam; 2017-?) who they grow a close connection and blah blah blah our title character helps Grace Farrell (Rose Byrne of Two Hands; 1999) fall in love with Will blah blah blah god damn this movie is a nightmare. QUVENZHAN√â CAN'T SING FOR NOTHING. Don't waste your money for the dvd."

" This Remake Is Better Than The Original
",0.6369,0.9864,2020-05-29 00:00:00,10,"The remake of the 1982 musical Annie, was better than the original. It had more charisma, and the story-line was better - especially the use of backstory on the characters. It helped us viewers engage more with the characters and feel sympathy, hatred, happiness or love towards them. The acting and screenplay was a lot better - its the 21st century now, and Zach Woodlee did a fantastic job with the choreography. Furthermore, the singing was better, and the actors and actresses did an amazing job. I loved this musical so much, I have seen it 3 times!!"

" Why, Cameron Diaz?
",0.0,0.9514,2020-03-30 00:00:00,7,"This isn't the pop-culture travesty many people fear it to be. I enjoyed it very much. The only complaint is that Cameron Diaz can not sing. I ask you, Mr. Director, why would you cast someone in a musical if they have no singing ability? Everyone else has incredible singing chops, though. The film is surprisingly watchable and is an example of a remake done (mostly) right. They could have cut a very slow, boring song about an hour in the film, but I guess all musicals need at least one so it gives the audience a chance to get concession refills. While it has been updated to be modern-day instead of Depression-era like the original, that's not a bad thing. No kid would want to see a movie about the Great Depression anyway. I did have one problem with this movie though. Apparently they name Annie's dog Sandy because he/she (I don't know the dog's gender; its never mentioned) has a lot of energy like a hurricane. Too soon, guys. Too soon.
Grade: B. 7/10 3/5 stars"
" these reviews are all horrid.
",-0.5423,0.995,2020-03-25 00:00:00,9,"I love this film. I really do. Sure maybe the acting isn't top notch, and maybe the jokes are corny and the songs auto tuned, but I absolutely love it. Sure it's not a match to the first Annie, but maybe it wasn't supposed to be. This film does exactly what it advertises to do. It's a really fun, feel good family film. And I really liked the songs. And I adored Cameron Diaz. Sure her acting wasn't exactly incredible, but she's really funny, and brings a lot to the film. It's not oscar worthy, but it's a really cute film and a brilliant way to spend 2 hours in my opinion. I guarantee unless you're as stone hearted as the rest of these reviewers you will come out smiling."

" Adorable Remake
",0.4939,0.9911,2020-01-27 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this version of Annie. I was born the year the original ""Annie"" movie came out and as a little girl I would watch it when it would come on NBC. I also would rent the movie as well. Being a huge Shirley Temple fan, I'm often surprised she never played the character since it would have been the perfect role for her.So, when this remake came out, I didn't see it on its initial run in the theater, but I watched it today and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Quevazhane Wallis was adorable as Annie. Is she the best singer? No, but she's got the spunk, determination, and charm that captures the character of Annie. Jamie Foxx is always good and so is Rose Byrne and Cameron Diaz.As an African American woman, I got a little choked up finally seeing a movie with a talented young lady play in a role that I would have loved to see 30 years ago. I remember when Keisha Knight Pulliam played in ""Polly"" a version of ""Pollyanna"" with an African American cast and it was spectacular. These roles are few and far between. Moving forward, I would to see more young ladies of color in starring roles."

I thought the songs were fun and catchy (including the new ones). The chemistry between Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx gave the movie an emotional weight and yes, I did cry towards the end.

She is a street smart kid who lives in the foster home of Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) a tough mother who deep down, really deep down, is a good person. Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) is a billionaire running for the mayor of NY with PR problems. He comes across worse than Mitt Romney eating ""cheesy grits."" He literally runs into Annie, a girl obsessed with finding her real parents.Against his better judgement (kids have germs) he becomes her foster dad for photo ops. Annie realizes her role and plays the part, enjoying it while she can. As you might guess the two become attached to each other and he even allows her to adopt Sandy, a misfit dog who ""licks her own hoo-ha."" She becomes the best thing that ever happened to him.The film has scenes of hope, love and redemption. It is not that serious of a film that it doesn't make fun of itself, musicals, or Annie films in general. As a musical it left something to be desired.

She is sad yet resentful and constantly dwelling over her past and what could have been. This character is very different from Miss Hannigan in the original, played by Carol Burnett, who was abusive and hated children, but did not want to see Annie die.The songs were changed to fit with present day. So were most of the story lines. That did mean that a lot of songs and plot lines that made the story were cut out of this version of Annie. The movie does reference some parts of the original. Annie gives a class presentation on FDR. Updated versions of songs from the original are played.But this movie is not the original. I have watched it repeatedly because I find the tunes to be catchy. The original is a classic. This movie is a take on what that storyline would look like today.Watch both."

",0.4404,0.7835,2019-02-16 00:00:00,6,"I saw this on Amazon Prime. The original was one of my favorites. This movie misses the mark in so many ways. A lot of really important plotlines from the original movie are missing. Cameron Diaz is attractive and I have liked her in other roles (My Sister's Keeper and Bad Teacher), I just didn't like her as Miss Hannigan. Carol Burnett nailed that one.This movie is a modernized version of a classic. Too different from the original for me."
" Loved It the First Time and I Still Love It Now
",0.8442,0.9947,2019-02-15 00:00:00,7,"Is this the best musical, comedy, or family film? No, it's not, but does that mean you can't enjoy it? Absolutely not.I saw this movie in theaters with my sisters, nieces and nephews and absolutely loved it. Having watched it recently, sure, it's not perfect by any means--especially with the writing, dialogue and some of the lyrics--but I still love it as much as I did when I saw it the first time.It's definitely a movie that you can enjoy and have fun with, especially if you don't have high expectations and just want an entertaining, family-friendly movie.The cast, songs, comedy, and character development are still well-done to a certain degree, and even if you haven't seen the original like I have, again, you can still enjoy this film. All you gotta do is give it a chance. You might even be surprised. Either way, I love this movie and it's one of my favorite musicals next to 2007's Hairspray and 2008's Enchanted, as well as 1989's The Little Mermaid. That's how much I love this film. Plus, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Wallis' performance, and the fact that Sia helped write the songs just make it even better. Trust me, you'll see what I mean. Ignore the haters and watch this film."
" Hard knock watch
",-0.1027,0.0869,2019-02-02 00:00:00,4,I've never been a fan of Annie so an un needed remake was never going to make me to happy. It's not going to be a movie that is remember led unfortunately
" Very good
",0.4927,0.6753,2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Feel good movie, better than the older one. The characters are portrayed very well and the music is good. The plot is very basic but an all-around family movie."

" A beautiful retelling of a classic
",0.5994,0.9335,2018-11-05 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it is a superb retelling of the classic Annie. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.
" Horrible
",-0.5423,0.2659,2018-09-13 00:00:00,1,"Cheap, cheesy knock off of what was a great musical. Horrible acting and worse directing. Just goes to show Hollywood is running out of original ideas so they are destroying well done classics and taunting them with corny jokes are bad actors. Don't waste your time. Watch the original with Albert Finney and Carol Burnett. Better than any remake."
" Flop

" Joyful

" Annie
",0.0,0.9996,2018-04-01 00:00:00,4,"The original 1982 movie, an adaptation of the Broadway hit, based on the popular comic strip, is fun and worthwhile enough, this contemporary remake sees the title character going from red-headed moppet to an African American child with a big afro hairdo, I was willing to give it a chance, produced by Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith and Shawn ""Jay-Z"" Carter, directed by Will Gluck (Easy A, Friends with Benefits). Basically in Harlem, Manhattan Island, New York City, Annie Bennett (Golden Globe nominated Quvenzhan√© Wallis) lives in foster care with several other girls under the care of Colleen Hannigan (Razzie nominated Cameron Diaz), a bitter former singer taking the benefits, who spends most of her time drinking. Annie spends Fridays waiting outside Domani's restaurant, hoping her parents will return, as promised on a receipt note. One day, a city inspector checks on Hannigan's treatment of the girls, she sees her social security number on his form, and goes to find information, but she learns nothing she does not already know about herself. Annie saves a Shiba Inu dog from bullies, she steps out into the road, but is saved by mogul William Stacks (Jamie Foxx), who is running for mayor. Stacks' campaign manager Guy Danlily (Bobby Cannavale) tells him the rescue was caught on video and has gone viral, boosting his popularity, Guy convinces Stacks to take Annie in, to live with him, in a scheme to boost his campaign. Annie enjoys her new surroundings, and makes friends with many staff members, including Stacks' assistant Grace Farrell (Rose Byrne), and she adopts the dog from earlier, naming her Sandy. Bonding with Annie, Stacks reveals he never really knew his father, due to his work commitments, but believed he could understand him if he worked as hard, Annie also helps Stacks and Grace realise their romantic feelings for each other. Annie requests Stacks take her and her friends from Miss Hannigan's foster home to a movie premiere, Stacks is at first disinterested in the movie, but becomes a fan, along with Grace, Annie also insist they go to the after-movie party. Annie's friends are returned home, Annie then shows Grace her Friday routine of waiting for her parents; Grace sympathises and agrees to keep this secret from Stacks. At Hannigan's foster home, the girls accidentally wake her up; Hannigan snaps at them, saying rich people are not nice and will ditch anyone they don't like anymore, recalling her past, in a drunken state she recalls her former music career. Annie is asked to read a speech at a charity event, she runs out, revealing she cannot read, despite being 10 years old and attending school, Stacks decides to find a special-ed teacher for Annie, but Guy believes she will only hinder the mayoral campaign. Teaming up with Hannigan, Guy plans to find imposters to pose as Annie's parents, so that Stacks appears to have found them, to boost his popularity and win, Guy and Hannigan will share the payment. However, Guy plans to dump Annie back into the system following the election, with no care for her wellbeing, by the point Hannigan is having second thoughts, the imposters have already kidnapped Annie. Hannigan tells Stacks about the plan, Guy is fired, and Stacks, Grace, Hannigan and the girls board a helicopter to chase the getaway car. Annie is mistaken in thinking that Stacks arranged her kidnapping, the kidnappers assumed he paid them, not Guy, when she is rescued, she refuses to believe him that he had no knowledge of the scheme. To prove his innocence and he truly cares for Annie, Stacks announces to the press that he is quitting the mayoral race, and Annie helps Grace and Stacks admit their love for each other, all three of them dance and sing happily. Later, Annie announces the opening of the ""Stacks Literacy Centre"", to help children like her learn how to read, everyone sings her song ""Tomorrow"", Hannigan attempts to sing, only to be stopped. Also starring Lost's Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Nash, David Zayas as Lou, Dorian Missick as Annie's ""Dad"" and Tracie Thoms as Annie's ""Mom"". Wallis is suited to the leading role, she is both cute and confident, Diaz is nowhere near as memorable as Carol Burnett, and Foxx is adequate as the cynical billionaire won round by the youngster. It sticks to the same sort of plot, girl brought in to change a rich man's reputation and wins him round, only differences are she is an orphan in foster care rather than an orphanage, and everything is more modern, including the use of technology to assist characters. ""Hard Knock Life"" and the other original songs you are still just about able to sing along to, but it is a bit haphazard, the script is predictable, the choreography is not as slick, and the use of more vibrant colours is distracting, it is a fair but slightly sloppy musical comedy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Opportunity"", and it won the Razzie for Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel. Okay!"
" Great movie!
",0.6588,0.9577,2018-03-25 00:00:00,10,"I thought the movie was great! The original movie was in my era; however, I love the modern day version- lots of funny parts, entertaining musical (which I normally am not the movie musical type), etc. My child who is a 12 years love this movie too. Only part I thought could have done better was the musical part in the helicopter but I still would rate this movie a 10. Warm and fuzzy movie :)"
" Just plain awful
",-0.4588,-0.9834,2018-01-29 00:00:00,1,"Seriously it's just bad. How bad you may ask? To paraphrase a quote from Will & Grace, ""Mariah-Carey-in-Glitter"" bad.This movie is just so awful there is literally nothing good about it. Jamie Foxx's Will Stacks is so unlikeable you find yourself wishing he did get hit and killed by the truck at the beginning. Rose Byrne is grossly underutilised and given horribly vapid dialogue that even she can't make work. Cameron Diaz's performance as an abusive, drunk foster mum began ok and then she opened her mouth to sing and my ears started to bleed. As for newcomer Quvenzhane Wallis (P.S. Your parents should be shot for giving you that first name) seems to have been picked only because she's African American with a fro and a gap between her two front teeth. There really is no acting, singing or dancing talent here. The dialogue is pedestrian and for some reason everyone is speaking at 3x the normal speech rate so it's ridiculously hard to keep up with what's happening. And this is probably the biggest problem with this movie. It's moving so fast there's no time for character development or an emotions whatsoever. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE."
" A lovely family film
",0.5859,0.9653,2018-01-05 00:00:00,10,"The original is a great film, but I found this as good if not, better than that. It obviously brings it bang up to date. The tunes are fabulous and catchy, the film is fun and the actors and fun and convincing too. Simply put, what's not to like?"
" I wanted to like it...honest
",0.3612,0.9687,2017-12-26 00:00:00,4,"I really wanted to like this movie, partly because of nostalgia and partly because of the actors' charms. But it was not good. There were far too many awkward and obvious moments between those poorly dubbed musical numbers with loud drum machines. They somehow managed to make this story even more cliche...which is pretty darn impressive. I loved my Annie; my kids will love this Annie. Me? I pass."
" A good movie
",0.4404,0.9693,2017-11-25 00:00:00,9,"I loved the original movie, so was a bit skeptical about seeing this one, especially as it had some negative reviews when it first came out in the cinemas.The movie was similar to the original, but modernised. Gone are the mansion, maids, down-trodden streets of New York, the dark lighting, the all-white cast¬Ö in it's place, we know what Will Stacks (the modernised version of Daddy Warbucks) does for a living, a girl who can look after herself and is looking for her identity (maybe that was also in the original, but I can't exactly remember), and a multi-racial cast. Halleluiah!I remember an episode of Boston Legal where a girl was auditioning for a stage production of Annie, but the producers denied her because she wasn't the typical, stereotype, racial white. Who cares?! This movie proves that Annie can be whatever nationality she wants to be, and it's great!What made the original movie great was Carol Burnette's Hannigan, who was a nasty piece of work who only cared about herself and really put those poor girls to work ‚Äì I really felt sorry for those poor foster children! While Cameron Diaz doesn't have quite the same punch as Burnette, she pulled this role off in her own right, over the top as it was.The music was great, and I didn't notice, until I read some reviews that some of it was original pieces, which was great and spruced up the movie a lot more!Would I see it again? Sure."
" Real music, v1.00
",0.0,0.9673,2017-10-29 00:00:00,10,"I am finding these stories to be getting better and better. If the 1982 is a good 7, then the 1995 is a good 8 and the 2014 is more like a 10.I noticed some user reviews that objected to this not following the original play. I hope that to many that will seem like missing the point, and not just because of the original being a long running newspaper cartoon series.I find the music to sing. The familiarity of the old music and the new music, too. The only real flaw of the 1995, for me after seeing this, is that it included music when it would have been better without.Armchair tourism. Most stories have elements that are not too clear. North of 96th Street, yes. Try to follow the final chase with Rough Guide and Google Maps, I could not understand it too well. Two bad guys drive to a bridge in New Jersey via the Henry Hudson Parkway, then the George Washington Bridge, then south to Liberty State Park and then to the bridge. Why not the Holland Tunnel? I assume that a New Yorker would know."
" Won a ""Razzie"" for worst rip-off remake.
",-0.1027,-0.9623,2017-10-04 00:00:00,4,"Not an all black cast! I was surprised and pleased by that. Once I got over the initial fact that there ""ain't no freckle-faced redhead"" in the lead, I tried to gave the movie a chance. I really didn't like it very much. The 11-year-old playing Urban Annie can sing but is a weak dancer! However, some of the songs are almost ""thrown away"". I just didn't like some of the lead actors. A cell-phone magnate is a far cry from an industrialist or real estate tycoon. As it was set in the present day, it lost all all of its 1930's period charm. No Punjab! I suppose that today's orphans might be called Foster Children? ""Opportunity"" is the only decent new song and several familiar ones are missing. Jamie Foxx sings surprisingly well. Cameron Diaz does Miss Hannigan as an ex-pop star and there are only 4 kids. What happened to ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile? It plays over the end titles. Otherwise, it stands alone as a ""different"" musical remake and it seemed like a cheaply-produced TV movie. A penthouse view is not The Warbucks Mansion. Annie's parents are still alive but never show up! Very disappointing but it was a box office success! It only played 2 months past its Christmas Debut. For another bad ""remake"" see ""Annie-A Royal Adventure"", from many years ago."
" Very good family film
",0.4927,0.9737,2017-08-19 00:00:00,10,"This is a very good film. If someone is looking for a nice family film that the kids can watch with their parents, this is it. It has good story, it is funny, there is singing and there is no sex scene. There was only one kissing scene and it was light kissing. I really appreciate that. I am usually with the remote control , ready to change the scene when watching films with the kids. That was not necessary with this film.The scripts, acting, directing and producing of the film was good. Too bad some people decide to give it a low rating. If I was looking only at the rating to choose a film, I would not have seen this. It was good that I read the story and decided to go for it."
" A modern 'Annie'
",0.0,0.945,2017-07-07 00:00:00,5,"Having not seen any of the other film adaptations of 'Annie' or indeed the stage show I was actually one of the few perhaps who could watch this film with an open mind without constantly thinking ""oh they did this better in this version..."" I found this modern 'Annie' to be a warm hearted film, one in which everyone breaks into song, yes, but for a reason.It's a simple story told well, and a lot of that credit goes to writer/director, Will Gluck, who controls all the important plot points/moments well.I enjoyed this film."
" Quvenzhan√© Wallis the perfect Annie
",0.5719,0.9957,2017-06-13 00:00:00,10,"The 1982 Annie is one my top five most perfectly adorable movies of all time. To me it has a special place in the above ten star category, like fifteen stars. The story, music, choreography acting and flow were perfectly done. So, trying to compare the newer versions is difficult.This version of Annie is modernized, with cell phones and all kinds of electric gadgets. I didn't mind the modernization, it was fun to see the story in a different setting with enough new plot points to keep me wondering what going to happen next. The colors were brilliant, a real feast. The dance choreography is comparatively sparse, particularly ""Hard Knock Life"". There are additional songs, one of which (a rather quiet solo by Annie from her super-modern bed) I thought was a welcome addition, the others forgettable. The costumes were beautifully done. The movie as a whole was fun. My little nieces (6 & 12) watched it twice with sound full blast. What makes this version a ten star film rests on Quvenzhan√© Wallis being an absolute perfect Annie. No red hair, but well, her acting is adorable, funny, and lighter than air like the best young dancers. She out-sparkled even the very sparkly Aileen Quinn (Annie, 1982). Jamie Foxx as Stack is an extra bonus, a very funny ""Warbucks"". Taylor Richardson who introduces the movie as ""Red-haired Annie"" set the stage perfectly, so let me recommend seeing her more extensive role in Jack of the Red Hearts(2015), and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. The rest of the cast fine, but nothing to stand out or criticize."
" Great movie

I love how it is modernized. The songs are great quality and are sung by highly experienced actresses and singers It features Cameron Diaz, helping target market."
" The Sun Ain't Coming Out Tomorrow with this film
",0.0,-0.8646,2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,"Trying to modernise a well loved story/classic film is fraught with danger. If you change things you are damned for changing. If you keep things the same you are damned by comparison to the 'classic' versions that have gone before. This film fails on both levels. Setting it in modern times makes you cringe with embarrassment. Acting kids always have that smiley theatre trained over confident, precocious totally unreal 'fake' sound and look, which is pretty much standard for a group of kids, particularly in a musical. In this offering they actually reach a new level of annoyance. But you can excuse the kids, because the adults are so so much worse. Cameron Diaz cannot act - it was pitiful. Do not waste your time watch this film, you will never get that 2 hours of your life back. You have been warned."
