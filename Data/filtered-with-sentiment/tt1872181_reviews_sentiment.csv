" Good, but could be better
",0.7003,0.1949,2021-03-21 00:00:00,7,"The special effects at the battles with Electro was impressive. As a comic book fan, those scenes were fantastic to me! Also as a fan, Gwen's death match my expectations: It's was sad, impacting and totally alike the comics. It is a mark at Spiderman history, what makes a shame that the 3Â° movie was cancelled.
The villans are very poorly constructed, specially Harry Osborn, that was so well constructed at the previous trilogy. It's was kinda desappointing. Electro's motivation was also weak, maybe the movie tries to introduce to many characters at once."

-The Relationship between Peter and Gwen
-Green Goblin's look.
-Terrible plot.
-Way too less connection to The Amazing Spider-Man 1.This movie did not please me..in The Amazing Spider-Man 1 I kinda felt a connection between Peter and Gwen but in this movie it just felt like a ordinary movie relationship problems..
Everything seemed so sloppy..there were a lot of loose ends left untouched from The Amazing Spider-Man 1, and the plot felt so forced and stupid at times(ex:the start scene with Rhino) just to create some action and to add some jokes..
I did not like the Green Goblin look or his ""fight"" at the end of the movie.. they should have just stopped after the Electro fight because after that everything gets super rushed and messed up like Gwen's Death and the other stuff.. I just wanted the movie to end already.."

" The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014, Marc Webb) Garfield's second outing is fun, but formulaic
",0.5499,0.997,2021-02-11 00:00:00,6,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014, Marc Webb)
This latest Spider-Man adventure finds Peter Parker and his webslinging alter ego up to most of the same tricks. He's flying around the city fighting crime with his usual panache when seemingly out of nowhere a super villain rises to the forefront to challenge him. Added to this is the wrinkle of Parker's parentage. Peter continues to search for answers behind who his parents were and why they left. While this is just another in a long lineage of super hero movie staples the story here doesn't feel stale or retread. It has pep and vitality primarily due to its lead, Andrew Garfield. While Tobey Maguire did the best he could he never seemed correct or comfortable in the role of Spider-Man or Peter Parker. Garfield takes to both roles with equal vigor. He may not be quite the bookish nerd that Parker should be but he is convincing as this tragically haunted yet brilliant kid. And as Spidey he excels especially in the way he banters and cracks wise with the criminals he's apprehending. With a new movie we get a new super villain and in this case it's the fiend Electro played by Jamie Foxx. The CGI for everything surrounding Electro is another element that allows the film to flourish. When the nature of your enemy is that he can become pure energy/electricity the visual effects really need to be on point to effectively utilize the character. Also in the mix is Harry Osborn who is Parker's friend but as we all know by now destined to become one of his greatest enemies in the form of the Green Goblin. Dane DeHaan is excellent as the aloof yet menacing Osborn. Emma Stone returns as Gwen Stacy who is Parker's love interest of the moment. The back and forth between them is one of the down checks of this movie. Peter's is in love with Stacy yet also knows that as Spider-Man anyone he loves is a target so begins/continues this will they or wont' they dance which really starts to wear. Also trying to follow in the footsteps of 'The Avengers' films and all those inhabiting that universe they are trying to, rather heavy handedly, lay ground work for further film in an attempt to expand the Spider-Man film universe. Only time will tell if following that same model will be successful however this Spidey flick is a fun entertaining ride that feels fresh while sticking to a tried and true super hero formula.

In my opinion I don't like when it was Peters destiny to become Spider-Man, I don't like it there could be people who like it but I don't but that's ok. Green Goblin only stuffed in this film to kill Gwen. This wasn't really a Spider-Man film it was a set up movie. They were setting up everything. If they took their time to set everything up they would've come out with a good movie. The cgi and the the suit are one of the best things in this little series. And Peter is the first act isn't that serious I understand Spider-Man pulls out jokes but this man lets people die and cars crash just to put out a few quips. Idk why they made it like this. Garfield with some work could've been a good Peter but it just didn't work."

It left me with tons of tears everytime i watch TASM 2. I have no idea why many people have disliked this movie. I mean, Andrew Garfield was perfect to play the iconic character. Andrew and Emma's performance alone made this movie fantastic. People hated the excessive villains but to me, it was rather entertaining and coherent for a comic book movie.The visuals are exceptional, which should be, because of the production budget. Spiderman's free-fall swinging sequence was amazing! Marc Webb's direction was great, the duo's chemistry, humour, heart, breathtaking cinematography, action sequences and uncontrollable emotional depth.The Hans Zimmer's score, which is remarkable as usual.

This movie is not that bad what critics says or some people or""SPIDEY FANS"" says this spider man is not a "" IRON SPIDER"" if you are getting what I want to say.
Now days what spider man movies we all are getting is zero if we compare it with its cinematography ; Basic plot (yes basic) ; and the most important ""SPIDER MAN COSTUME"" (yes I really love this costume and web shooter).
But the homecoming and far from home only succeeded because of MCU (IRON MAN)

" Disappointing Waste of Time
",-0.7184,-0.8022,2020-11-25 00:00:00,4,"The acting and camerawork are fine in it, but those are really the only positives. The plot is a huge mess with inconsistent writing for characters, too many villains and plot lines, and it all dissolves into a boring mess of a movie."
" Disappointed
",-0.4767,0.3716,2020-10-10 00:00:00,6,A good film but dissatisfied as the first film was one of my favorite Spider-Man films of all time.
" Missing the point...
",-0.296,0.9866,2020-10-06 00:00:00,5,"Director Marc Webb was trying so hard to accomplish with the Spider-Man franchise what Christopher Nolan achieved with the Batman franchise, but he simply isn't as polished as Nolan.If you were to skip the first 80 minutes of this overlong movie, you really won't miss much (ok, maybe just watch how Max Dillon becomes Electro). As for the rest, there were so many scenes that could and probably should have ended on the cutting room floor. There's simply too much uninteresting drama and unnecessary humor. And whenever Peter Parker and Gwen are together, their scenes drag the film down. Their relationship is boring and rather annoying, actually.The many character introductions are too comical, and mostly a waste of time. I felt like hitting the 'forward' button more often than not. I enjoyed the fact the film finally showed us what happened to Peter's parents, though.'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' only really gains momentum at around the 80-minute mark, when it becomes mysterious and a lot more interesting, with a lot going on all at once. Harry - Peter's best friend - is back (why he was left out in 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is still completely beyond comprehension). Only, Harry is not the same character Harry used to be in 'Spider-Man' (portrayed by James Franco). Harry is a devious character in this film - as if there are not enough villains already... (Dane DeHaan's performance as Harry is nevertheless very good).The film features some amazing visuals and photography, but ultimately way too much CGI - and I mean way too much! The villains also destroy things without purpose, simply for the sake of destruction. It didn't feel realistic and was merely an excuse for more CGI.As mentioned, the second half of the film was far more interesting than the first, and if I were to watch it again, I'd probably start watching around the half-way mark."

" Falling Without a Spiderweb
",-0.1531,-0.6788,2020-09-29 00:00:00,4,"The superhero saga and the cramming of franchise-building junk in ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is garbage, but the camerawork and effects are an improvement on past Spidey iterations, including the first ""Amazing Spider-Man"" (2012). From the start, the camera is swinging and twirling between skyscrapers right along with its CGI-enhanced vigilante. It's a far cry from the modest deployment in ""Spider-Man"" (2002) of the cable-suspended ""Spydercam."" There are no static greenscreen views of the Green Goblin in this one; no, he looks ridiculous for entirely different reasons this outing. Plus, the slow-motion effects move with the camera this time, are more consistent throughout, and are relevant to the climax instead of merely looking derivative of a Zack Snyder trademark. Since superhero movies are largely about spectacle, this isn't a complete failure. Now, about the rest of the movie....Vigilantes and criminals flying around and knocking each other about is only so compelling, so it helps when there's something narratively to ground it. Spiderman is promising relative to other comic-book series because it has a built-in meta-narrative, of Peter Parker's profession as a photographer, complimenting his spectacle in spandex by also being the recorder of that spectacle with the publication of his snapshots in the ""Daily Bugle."" Like Clark Kent and Lois Lane, but more visual instead of written--perfect for cinema. ""Far From Home"" (2019) succeeded in largely transferring this visual storytelling within the picture to the arch-enemy and the business of projecting images--films-within-the-film. Alas, such photographic reflexivity hardly factors in to the ""Amazing Spider-Man"" reboot. When not web-slinging, this Peter Parker spends most of his time in a will-they-won't-they teen love drama and combatting that out-of-control research lab, as well as playing with his crazy board and a secret subway car in his search of his father's work. Excessive and none too interesting.There seemed to be some promise to the Electro villain, too. While nothing came of his being black, or having apparent psychological problems and feeling underappreciated, his first big confrontation with Spidey occurs in front of jumbo screens in Times Square. The police in this one also seem to be miraculously quick at partitioning off spectators outside the boundaries of these action sequences. It's like street theatre. Shot of Spidey shooting webs and Electro firing bolts, followed maybe by footage of people in peril, then it cuts back to Gwen Stacy and other bystanders occupying the space of our surrogate movie viewers inside the movie. Perhaps, a decent plot could've been made of the superhero and supervillain competing for flattering publicity as well as for whose fastest at using their powers to overcome the other. But, no, the picture quickly diverts from this tract in favor of some petty supervillain team-up.""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) added to the photographic storytelling that of Mary Jane as an actress, so an actress-playing-an-actress. This offered the opportunity for plays-within-the-play that could compliment and reflect the outer narrative. A photo-journalist and a thespian instead of just a couple high-school grads and amateur scientists. Maybe it's just a coincidence that the will-they-won't-they of the romance wasn't as tiresome there, either.Another unique opportunity with this comic-book supe is that the movies usually portray him as a teenager. So, his discovery and eventual mastery of his powers can work as a puberty parable. Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" did quite well in this regard methinks. ""Homecoming"" (2017) added call-backs to past high-school movies. But, this Spidey is just some jerk who can't keep a promise and who is the catalyst for all this city destruction, from passing off the work his dad went to the trouble of hiding as his own leading to the lizard of the first movie, to stealing from a convenience store killing his uncle and burglarizing a lab creating his superpowers, which in this sequel inspire other wackadoos to seek revenge against him. The ""Daily Bugle"" is right; he's a menace.The only thing worthwhile here outside of the spectacle is the pun in one scene of Peter and Aunt May literally hiding their dirty laundry from each other."
" Way to sad and emotional
",-0.3612,-0.9564,2020-09-24 00:00:00,1,I literally can't take the amount of tragedy and sadness. If you dont like watching people die then do not watch this!! Its horrify!
" This had so much potential!
",0.0,0.9735,2020-09-20 00:00:00,7,"I try really hard not to compare a film to the comic books that they get their inspiration from, but it's tough not to. I get frustrated with people who say, ""it's not as good as the book"", so I try not to do the same thing with the comics. However, the comic book fan in me hated this, but if you remove that influence from the equation, this actually is not a bad movie.Lots of emotions run high in this film and the action is perfect. There are some silly lines of dialogue, although appropriate for the Spider-Man mythos. Some of the comedy was not needed. The Producers of these films need to remember that a large bank of the viewing public thinks these kinds of movies are silly, so don't make it even more silly if you want to keep ticket sales going. The special effects and action scenes are worth the money at the theater, so don't think I'm not saying to wait for DVD. It must be seen in the theaters.Although, I don't think she is a good Aunt May, Sally Field still manages to knock it out of the park and Dane DeHaan does a spectacular job as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin. Jamie Foxx as Electro seemed a little bit like he was just collecting a paycheck. The chemistry between Garfield and Stone is very good, but I still think the relationship between Maguire and Dunst in the Sam Raimi movies was more believable. I am still a bigger fan of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films, although Director Marc Webb did show some promise, that may have come in the third film, which, as we all know, never happened. Which, may have been a blessing, because we all know that Sam Raimi ran out of gas once he got into Spiderman 37.6 (C+ MyGrade) = 7 IMDB"

" Spider-Man 3 without the strong characters, relationships, and emotional core
",-0.2737,-0.7149,2020-08-21 00:00:00,2,"Marc Webb's sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man finds the superhero genre and filmmaking mediocre at its best and egregious at its worst. There is no style or originality when it comes to Webb's direction or the storytelling. The 142-minute film is so focused on setting up future movies and introducing so many characters and subplots that we only see Spider-Man himself for 30 minutes out of that runtime. Here are all the characters and subplots the film tries and fails to balance: the Rhino wreaking havoc on New York, Peter and Gwen's on again-off again relationship, the disappearance of Peter's parents, Norman Osborn's death and Harry inheriting the business only to be removed as CEO later on, Peter and Harry's supposed friendship, Harry wanting Spider-Man's blood to combat a disease he inherited from his late father Norman, an Oscorp engineer named Max that becomes Electro, Aunt May studying to become a nurse, and ""The Gentleman"" appearing at the end of the film form the sinister six.The film as a whole can best be summed up by its opening scene: poorly shot, edited, and paced, derivative of other action films, and ultimately pointless in the context of the story. Just as with The Amazing Spider-Man, the subplot regarding Peter's parents remains a nonstarter, having no effect whatsoever on the rest of the movie. Marc Webb is a talented director and understands how to film romantic comedies, such as his first film 500 Days of Summer, but he doesn't have a clue when it comes to filming action. The times square sequence and the final showdown between Spidey and Electro and Green Goblin are so sloppily filmed and edited they can't even rely on the special effects as a crutch as it all looks artificial. Not to mention his use of televisions, holograms, computers, and Sony products solely as exposition dumps. Even Hans Zimmer, an immensely talented composer, leaves much to be desired with his musical score. The majority of the film's score sounds like stock action movie music, with no unique flair. Spider-Man himself doesn't even get his own spine-tingling theme to kick in whenever he's called into action.The dialogue in this film is without a doubt the worst in any Spider-Man movie ever made. Reviewers that claim Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films were too cheesy compared to Marc Webb's films have some nerve after listening to the predictable, clichÃ©-ridden dialogue on display in this sequel. The 5-minute exchange between Peter and May in their house about the laundry is so painfully unfunny and poorly written it's embarrassing. Then there's Electro, playing the ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"" with electricity and uttering lines like: ""It's time to light my birthday candles!"" The romantic scenes between Peter and Gwen are the worst offenders of this. Garfield and Stone had palpable chemistry in the first film, but it's somehow lost in this movie. Their interactions are so awkward and wooden, and Peter once again comes off as a creep, admitting to Gwen that he has followed her at least once a day since they broke up.None of the actors in this film are done justice nor are their characters. Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Paul Giamatti, Jamie Foxx, and Dane Dehaan have all been established as gifted actors in other movies, but if you only watched this movie, you'd never know. Giamatti is clearly going for an over-the-top and funny performance, and only succeeds at the former. Watch Sideways instead. Jamie Foxx manages to muster some sympathy for his character, a nerdy scientist named Max Dillon, but really his characterization copies that of Jim Carrey's the Riddler from Batman Forever: a brilliant but socially awkward scientist that obsesses over a superhero, talking to themselves, and ultimately growing to hate their hero. The motivations for this villain are so weak and senseless: he has no reason to hate the web-head in this film because Spider-Man is the only one that has noticed Max and told him that he's a somebody, calling him his ""eyes and ears."" Foxx's clear dedication to the role aside, his performance becomes lost in the horribly rendered, CGI Electro, that looks about as convincing as a video game character. Watch Collateral instead. Dane Dehaan's Harry Osborn is perhaps the worst character in the film. Not only is Harry introduced 30 minutes into the film, but his subplot regarding a horrific disease he inherited from his late father Norman that in his mind requires Spider-Man's blood to counteract makes no sense. The clock is ticking for Harry and yet it took decades for it to claim Norman's life, then at the end of the film when asked about it, he merely states: ""it comes and goes."" Dehaan's line delivery is so stilted and stagnant that it causes every single scene he's in to drag. And if you thought Willem Dafoe's costume for the Green Goblin looked silly, Dehaan's looks worse, boasting a truly ugly and unimaginative villain. Watch Chronicle instead.I understand and applaud the fact that the screenwriters were going for a love interest that had more agency and wasn't a damsel-in-distress. However, while Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy was a damsel-in-distress to the point where it was ridiculous and frustrating, she was a dynamic character that had a mature and realistic character arc. Mary Jane was a human being and the writing for her character was consistent. Gwen Stacy, portrayed by Emma Stone in this film, is so poorly written and characterized that it's insulting to the character and Stone's talent. Gwen doesn't exist outside of Peter Parker's world and her character never rises above a generic love interest. In Spider-Man 2, the beginning established that Mary Jane was able to make her dreams come true and enjoy success without Peter. The writing for Gwen during the climax is so illogical and ham-fisted. Gwen shows up to the final battle with Electro and the Green Goblin against Peter's wishes, exclaiming: ""Nobody makes my decision for me! This is my choice!"" She shows up having neither the weaponry, fighting skills, nor the superpowers to survive a situation like that, and she doesn't. Her death scene has no emotional weight to it because she didn't have to be there nor was she taken there against her will, she chose to be there, and it was that ""strong"" choice that got her killed.Sam Raimi's underrated Spider-Man 3 has probably one of the worst reputations a superhero film can have: being constantly referred back to as ""bad,"" a ""disappointment,"" or one of the worst of all time. Needless to say, many people think it's an overloaded mess and the worst Spider-Man film we've seen. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 hits the exact same beats that Spider-Man 3 did: three villains that crowd the picture and too many subplots and new characters that don't receive the screen time they deserve. However, the main difference between these two movies are the characters and the risks the directors were willing to take. Raimi dared to take his characters to dark and mature places, exploring the darkness within Peter Parker and how it affects his relationships with others. Was it a perfect film? No, but it has enough going for it to overcome its flaws. Webb directs his characters with no clear direction or sense of seriousness. The movie never takes itself seriously enough to pack an emotional punch. Instead, he decides to introduce Spider-Man as a hero that's fine with letting destruction, chaos, and possible life loss occur as long as he can do a comedy routine for a criminal. And the motivation and arcs for the rest of the characters need not make sense or take their time. The one good scene in the film comes when Spider-Man saves a little boy from bullies and walks him home. This is the only scene that captures the spirit of Spider-Man and present him as a hero worth looking up to.Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man 2 fails as both a Spider-Man film and a superhero film. He and the four credited story writers try too hard in certain areas of the movie (setting up future films, introducing as many characters and plotlines as possible, taking advantage of Garfield and Stone's chemistry) and doesn't try hard enough in others (character development / motivations / relationships, dialogue, style, focus, tone, action, musical score.) This film is without a doubt the worst Spider-Man film we have received thus far and an example of how to make a movie that advertises Sony pictures and future films to come without having to tell a cohesive story with strong, developed characters."
" Good film!
",0.4926,-0.4215,2020-08-05 00:00:00,7,"The story and plot had potential that was not completely realized. The action was good - 8 - liked the POV/First person shots and camera moves. The acting was modest - 6.5. The character's dialogue was pretty good most of the time, witty, sharp - 7 but when it failed it was a 2, and it failed at critical times. The dialogue (and acting) really fell short during the dramatic emotional scenes. A lot of close-ups and teary-eyed emotional scenes that hit the same note and seemed trite. The characters said exactly what they thought, spilling their guts with no subtlety -- dialogue was too head on. The characters ultimately came off as shallow. The story got long and seemed to wander at the end becoming as much about setting up the next movie as satisfying it's potential. More time could have been spent making the characters compelling."
" Depressing Spider-Man
",-0.3818,0.4208,2020-07-22 00:00:00,5,"I just finished this on FX. Never saw part one. I skipped both in theaters because I thought Andrew Garfield was miscast. I was right. He's whiny, weepy and behaves more like a counselor. ""It's gonna be alright. It's gonna be ok"" he says regularly as Spider-Man. He has good chemistry with Dane DeHaan and zero chemistry with Emma Stone. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey is annoying. I never found her annoying in other movies. Jamie Foxx nails it as Electro, but his character is never fully fleshed out - from pushover geek to powerful villain in 5 minutes. Dane DeHaan and Colm Feore are great and fascinating actors, and I liked their scenes. Still, they deserved a better script. Aunt May is tired, aging and hustling for double work shifts to put Peter Parker through college, yet I never saw him in one class. Later on, Peter Parker mourns someone at a grave site through winter, spring, summer and fall - it was a bizarre and depressing montage. I grew up on the Tobey Maquire Spider-Man movies. They were mostly fun and well-written. This Garfield one was ok, but too depressing."

Neither the reason for these maniac turned villains seemed to be strong enough to turn against our super hero, nor the plot helped them enough in this cause. The progression in character development we saw in this movie with eminent chemistry between Andrew Garfield starrer Amazing Spiderman and his lady love played by Emma Stone was the saving grace but not as much as to feel sad about a tragic end to it. 6/10 is all I could muster for this."
" Not as bad as others say!
",0.484,0.8536,2020-07-07 00:00:00,7,"I think this film is quite underrated. It's not as good as the Spider-Man films with Tobey Maguire or Tom Holland, but it's better than its predecessor. The actors all portray the characters well, though it does get morose at times. Jamie Foxx does surprisingly well in his role considering it is not his usual type of character. It is definitely a new interpretation of the franchise. However, I can understand the complaint that it is too long and combines too many storylines in one.

" The Worst Spider-Man Movie
",-0.6249,-0.9623,2020-06-24 00:00:00,2,"I have seen quite a few of negative reviews about ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" and the Andrew Garfield franchise as a whole, so I had quite low expectations for the two movies. While the first movie was alright (5/10), this one was not good at all, the acting lost its authenticity, Garfield's performance in this movie is the most inauthentic Spider-Man performance I have seen. Other supporting actors such as Foxx and Stone were okay but did not do much to stand out. The plot is messy and I do not understand why 2 villains, Electro was suffifcent and the final battle was not really enternaining to watch. Some of the visual effects were alright in this movie, but other most prominent effects such as Electro and the Electric visual effects were not impressive and felt ripped-off from some other Marvel or Sci-Fi movie.Overall, I think I can deduce that this is the worst Spider-Man movie I have watched, it really dissapoints at all levels unfortunately. Messy plot, bad acting and crappy visual effects. Please do not watch, in fact do yourself a favor and avoid the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man franchise, both the Tom Holland and the Tobey Maguire franchises are a hell of a lot better than this one in almost every way."

I am now 40 minutes into the movie... and... i'm sorry... but 5/10 is all i can muster.

" THE Amazing...
",0.0,0.5966,2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,"After so much controversy and criticism pertaining to this particular film, I decided to give it a rewatch and I can definitely reassure Spider-Man fans that, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't awful, but flawed...To avoid any spoilers, I will just state the biggest argument of this film, which is that: ""It had a lot going on"". The reason for that though was due to Sony's plans to set up a Live Action Spider-Man Universe. So The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was the one film of the series that essentially had to get sacrificed with too much being in it in order to kickstart their future film plans, which was: Sinister Six, The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Venom, etc.PS: I really recommend that before you watch this movie, that you also watch videos critically reviewing it, because after the movie is completed, you'll be shocked as to how far off most of those reviews are. A lot of them nitpick every aspect of the movie that rubbed particularly them the wrong way... You really begin to appreciate the Marc Webb, Andrew Garfield films much more compared to the current team."
" The amazing Spider-Man 2
",0.5859,0.9827,2020-06-10 00:00:00,6,"Once again a good example about movie that critics don't like, but I enjoy to watch. Of course this isn't greatest movie of history, but as a comic book filming it is very entertaining. Spider-Man's leaps between skyscrapers are beautiful to watch especially in 3D experience is like sitting on a roller coaster. Andrew Garfield is great as a Spider-Man, Emma Stone succeed well as Spider-Man's girl friend despite the tragical end. Sally Field is always great actress. Only Jamie Foxx don't convince in his role as a nerd. Luckily he act nerd only half of the film and the rest of the movie he is digitally enhanced Electro. Story is entertaining and pretentious comic book adaption and that is the way it should been watch. Albeit the dialogue is quite childish at time to time it doesn't bother too much. Lots of popcorn and enough of soda is all you need to enjoy this movie. If you want to say something bad about the movie you could say it has been inflate to so big that it will be a hard to surpass on next movie. Movies massive budget (200 million dollars) is hard to cross over. On the other hand if movie makes enough profit as theatrical release couple of more millions should not be any infeasible to approve."
" More of the same - an uneven, overblown CGI-fest
",0.0,-0.9897,2020-06-10 00:00:00,6,"Spiderman (Andrew Garfield) faces off against Electro (Jamie Foxx), an electrically-charged super villain. Typical MCU PG shtick: a superhero cracking wise while saving the city from violent but mostly bloodless carnage. Garfield is OK as the web-slinger but much of his dialogue was strained and contrived, especially the incessant quips. Emma Stone makes for a striking Gwen Stacy but the character's 'deux ex machina' arrival in the power plant was a silly plot twist and Jamie Foxx is fine as the syntho-voiced and largely CGI Electro but painfully awful as pre-villain nebbish Max Dillion. The film seems rushed and is stuffed with too many characters. In addition to Electro, there is a perfunctory fight with the Green Goblin (including a wedged in back story) and a teaser squabble with a ridiculously mechanised 'Rhino' (Paul Giamatti, although it's hard to imagine any attempt to depict the Rhino character not looking ridiculous). The plot is a by-the-numbers superhero sketch with yet another energy-sucking threat that maybe can be stopped by feeding it too much energy (a threat/solution that's been around since at least 1953's 'The Magnetic Monster'). Typical for MCU opuses, the film is very uneven, swinging between sentimental melodrama and light-weight action-adventure, and even the tragic event in the final reel is granted no more the a few minutes of drama before Spidey is back to his signature gibes and one-liners. Most of the climactic battle is so drenched with flashing lights and shifting colour that it is hard to tell what is supposed to be happening and action sequences are filled with too many gimmicky (and clichÃ©d) slow-mo and bullet-time shots. The film's unimpressive returns killed this iteration of the Wall-crawler (the second of three in a decade)."
" Debated to give it a 6 or a 7
",0.0,0.1082,2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,This is a really strange movie for me. It is a lot less serious than its predecessor which doesn't work for me. There was some interesting sequences like the fight with Green Goblin at the end which turns out to be a very emotional scene and even the other fight scenes work to. I also liked the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. The plot to me was ok but I'd probably put the villains on the weaker side of the scale making for a not bad sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man duology.

",-0.3612,-0.6547,2020-06-04 00:00:00,4,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I just can't see past its many MANY flaws! The writing is one of the worst I've ever seen put on film. There is no meaningful dialogue in the entire movie, it is riddled with plot holes, the villains have weird to no motivation, Spider-Man has a total disregard for human life (also, why is there ALWAYS a crowd gathering around very dangerous situations like it's some sort of theme park attraction), at this point everybody knows that Gwen Stacy dies so there is no surprise in that, Harry Osborn is the worst representation of the character I've ever seen in any kind of media... I could keep going, but instead, I recommend The Cosmonaut Variety Hours video on YouTube discussing this movie. Watch that video and you'll know pretty much exactly how I feel about this film. 4/10, and that's generous, because I still love Spider-Man."

" The Underwhelming Spiderman: The sequel
",0.0,-0.3313,2020-05-24 00:00:00,5,"Really not a lot to boast about here. The 5th film in the total movies of its kind really needed to be a fresh take. Unfortunately, a villain who was mistreated his whole life suddenly receiving electrical super powers after a freak accident is just not that. Its not all Jamie Foxx's fault, the script and the character were just not on par.The acting was similar to the theme of the movie. Andrew Garfield gets a C as the hero himself, Emma Stone gets a B as Gwen Stacy, and Jamie Foxx gets a B- as Max Dillon aka Electro. Performances ranged from average to below average, and again it is not all to the fault of the actors.Overall, I do not have a lot to say about this film. Nothing stood out, nothing was memorable, and even the action wasn't anything to write home about. There were no attempts at a fresh story line or approach, maybe besides the death of Gwen, but that seemed like a futile desperate reach. The father dying at the end of the first movie and the daughter at the end of the sequel does not bring it home. The thing is, I believe it has a lot to do with the writing of the movie. It didn't give a chance for the actors and director to make something great out of it even if they pointed it in the right direction. Ultimately, I don't think it really would have ever taken flight. We aren't holding Jamie Foxx accountable here though, he did what he could which wasn't much at all."
" The Amazing Catastrophe!
",-0.2244,-0.9977,2020-05-20 00:00:00,3,"I could tell I wouldn't like this movie from the fact that it opened up with a bad plane fight scene invloning Peter's parents. Other than that however, the movie starts out strong! The opening montage is probably the best stuff this movie has to offer, we get introduced to our villain and we see spidey in his best with his new (gorgeous) suit. Annd then it all goes downhill.Where to start with this! One of the main problems this movie has is it's got waaay too many plot points! Electro becomes a villain and attacks the city, Spiderman needs to work out his relationship, Harry wants to cure himself, Peter wants to find out about his parents, Captain Stacey haunts Peter, Aunt May wants to be a nurse and Uncle Bens killer is still on the loose! Though you wont have to worry about that last part cause THEY DON'T ADRESS IT. The reason Peter put on the mask initially in the first movie was to find his unlces killer. And he never does! In either movie! Did they flat out forget about it?Other than that Electro is laughable. He falls into a tank of eels, ofcource that fixes his tooth gap and gives him powers aaand now he doesn't view Spiderman as a friend anymore and he suddenly decides that *yeah I'm gonna be a god*. Seriously? Plus his design is awful. Rhyno is a joke it's best to pretend he's not even in this. And Harry... where to begin with Harry? First of all, the performances here are fine, and the cast is great but Harry is so badly acted for some reason. It's hard to watch at times. Also his whole arc makes zero sense. His father tells him he must find a cure for the plot diseas.. oh excuse me the Osborn disease or he'll die like him. Ok.. doesn't he have like at least 30 years? The guy is in his early 20s and his father is like in his 50s if not 60s. Why is he in such a rush? Also when he asks for Spidermans blood, why would Spiderman decline? He's supposedly gonna die very soon anyways! Yes your blood might kill him, but not giving him your blood WILL MOST CERTAINLY kill him! Also I love how Harry approaches Peter cause *he takes pictures of Spiderman so he must know him*. Harry that's not how photography works!On another note, we have Peter making fun of every situation. I know he makes jokes in the comics, but he doesn't sacrifice human lives so that he can make the jokes! And don't get me started on his parents! When I saw Peter accidentally breaking a calculator only for it to reveal coins that he used on an abandoned subway station that revealed a secret wagon-lab where his father had arranged some expository dialogue for him... I think I lost a few IQ points that I will never take back. The romance is also incredibly annoying. And even worse than Electro is the Goblin who looks like a crack addict and who Spiderman doesn't even take seriously. The ONLY reason he's in this is so they can remake Gwens death for cheap fan service.But what bothers me THE MOST is that Peter being Spiderman has almost NO impact on his life. Yes Gwen dies because he's not willing to let her go in order to protect her, but it's not like he didn't have a thing with her. Other than that he's great! No money problems, no not being able to pay the rent, no failing classes, no impact whatsoever! The conflict between Peter and Spiderman is pivotal to every Spiderman story, and here it's almost non existent!The ok things about this movie are some nice fight scenes, some ok acting and some decent cinematography. Also not gonna lie the cgi is spot on. On every other department it fails, miserably! It's like the looked at everything that made Spiderman 3 bad and said *let's do that but even worse this time round!*. Worst Spiderman movie and it's not even close. 2.5/10."

Honestly if I'm being fair, I'd rather choose to rewatch this movie again that the first one, it's just because that it kind of manages to be funny unintentionally the whole way through from the god awful score, the laughable villains, the acting, characters and the convoluted script. The worst Spider-Man movie, there is nothing much to say really, except the fact that it's hilarious. So if I'd want to get a fair few laughs, I assume this movie could be ok, but I also find it aggravating for how bad this movie is."

" Fun, well done and well acted, but with script problems, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 has great chances of repeating the success of the previous film
",0.9274,0.9995,2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Despite some criticisms, the previous film received several positive reviews, in addition to a good result at the box office worldwide, thus guaranteeing a sequel. Again directed by Marc Webb and scripted by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt based on the characters created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, we see the return of Andrew Garfield as our hero, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, as well as Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Paul Giamatti in the roles of the main antagonists.In this sequence, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) loves to be Spider-Man, even though being the arachnid hero puts him in very complicated situations, especially with his girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and aunt May (Sally Field). Despite this, he balances his various facets as well as he can. At the moment, Peter is more concerned with the ghost of the promise made to Gwen's father, that he would walk away from her to protect her. At the same time he has to deal with the return of an old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), and the emergence of a powerful villain: Electro (Jamie Foxx).""Spectacular Spider-Man 2"" continues several plots presented in the previous film, showing Peter who remains Spider-Man and helping to save New York City and who also works as a photographer for the Daily Bugle. In love, he continued the relationship with Gwen Stacy, but he lives tormented by the promise made to the father of his love, which ends up wanting to cause a series of conflicts in the relationship and distancing him from Gwen even with the two loving each other. This plot is interesting and makes the relationship evolve, bringing new questions, such as the proposal for Gwen - who continues to work at Oscorp Industries - to study in Oxford, England amid the separation of the couple, which leads them to question whether they should or not to follow different paths in life. Would the couple's love be enough to forget past promises and move on, respecting each other's choice? Once again the chemistry of the couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone - who at the time were also a couple in real life - is genuine and engaging. The pair of great actors manage to pass all the complicity and love to overcome the barriers in their relationship. They understand each other in looks, in conversations, in small teasing with each other. By the way, Gwen has a much greater importance than it already had in the previous feature.The character Mary Jane Watson would have a small appearance in this film and would certainly assume the role of Peter's love interest in an eventual conclusion of this second trilogy of the character, especially after the events of the last act of this second part. Mary Jane would be played by Shailene Woodley, who even filmed some scenes like the character in the film, however, months before the premiere, it was announced that Mary Jane was cut from the film. Director Marc Webb later said the cut was ""a creative decision to simplify the story and focus only on Peter and Gwen and their relationship"".
Another plot that has new developments is the past of Peter's parents and how he continues to influence the hero in his decisions. The script shows us more of what happened to the parents just before the plane crash that killed them, the connection between Peter's father, Richard Parker, with Norman Osborne and why he had to abandon his son in the care of his uncles Ben and May, as much as they didn't want to. Finally, Peter - and the audience, of course - has many of the answers to the mysteries he has always sought to unravel since he was a child. Her relationship with Aunt May (Sally Field) is also more interesting, with her aunt wanting to protect the boy from the events of the past concerning Peter's parents, whom she believes to be the truth about what had happened. This unbridled desire for Peter to know the truth about his parents' past also causes jealousy in May, who does not want to see his boy suffer.However, the way of approaching the villains was once again the major narrative problem. Even though he has been on the production team since the first trilogy led by Sam Raimi, it seems that Avi Arad and Kevin Feige did not learn much from the initial trilogy. Again, the producers and director Marc Webb try to put several villains and interconnect them in a single story, but just as in ""Spider-Man 3"" - which brought together Areia Sand, the new Green Goblin and Venom - the script does not convince and tries to get just an excuse to join the greatest number of threats possible in a single film, without developing any of the characters.Theoretically being the main villain of the film - which even gives the film its name - Max Dillon (Electro does not pass the image of a great threat until near the end. Played by Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, the character is presented as a brilliant scientist, who developed a plant alone for Oscorp, but who is a rejected person, without friends and who has always been invisible to everyone and who puts on a pedestal anyone who gives him a little more attention or who makes him feel special. Living like that alone made him an extremely unstable person. The point is that Electro's motivations are not credible. The fact that Spider-Man paying attention to him has already made him venerate the hero, even when the Spider doesn't recognize him anymore transformed after the genetic alteration he had suffered after the accident at Oscorp, it is enough for him to become his enemy. Not to mention that he is easily defeated in the fight in the middle of Times S quare and only reappears in the final act when allying with another character.Harry Osborne appears after studying at a boarding school at the age of 11. Rejected by his father and destined to suffer from the same genetic inheritance as his family, the heir of Oscorp Industries returns to see his father Norman (Chris Cooper) practically on his deathbed and starts trying to get the blood of Spider-Man, who could use to search for a cure for your degenerative disease and save your own life. Harry is presented as arrogant, ambitious and doubtful. His father's abandonment and rejection shaped that boy into what he became. Peter's old childhood friend and having helped him when the boy had lost his parents in the past, the two meet again and resume the friendship relationship. The two support each other, as they consider themselves as two rejected, abandoned by their parents. This relationship could have been much better developed, but Harry's vindictive attitudes occur extremely quickly, as well as his transformation into the Green Goblin - with a much better look than that presented in the first trilogy. The villain appears out of nowhere, attacks the hero out of nowhere, loses easily and then disappears, to resurface in the end allied to the mysterious Mr. Fear, in another moment of pure confusion. Despite the good performance of Dane DeHaan, the abrupt form of changes that occurred with the character, are negative points. DeHaan's Green Goblin would deserve an entire film as the main character, so that it could be fully explored.To make matters worse, they still managed to fit in a third villain, Rino (Paul Giamatti), who appears in the first and last scene of the film. The great visual surprise of the film has mere seconds to show its best shape. The character only served to show the audience fans of the comics, what the villain's look would be like in real life. Giamatti, who is an excellent actor, does not have any space to develop the villain.The director Marc Webb bets again on the direction of actors and proved to be competent again both in the action scenes with his camera always very well positioned to bring the best angle to the audience, especially when she passes for the heroes of the arachnid. Despite very well constructed scenes, the feeling we have is that more impactful scenes were lacking. Highlight for the fight sequence between Electro and Spider-Man in Times Square - the electrocuted handrail with the highlight - and the entire final sequence at the Oscorp plant between Spider-Man and the two villains. As in the previous film, the visual effects are incredible. We can also notice a greater number of comedy scenes. In addition to the chemistry with Emma Stone, Garfield is even more comfortable with the character. The Spider looks like he's out of the comics. The attitudes of the Friend of the Neighborhood are perfect. In the fight against villains we have the playful Spider, practically dancing with the enemies.The soundtrack was composed this time by Hans Zimmer, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film. Marc Webb and Zimmer formed a supergroup with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and Eurythmics, David A. Stewart, to create the music for the sequel. Eventually, Stewart did not participate in the film's music, and the supergroup, credited as The Magnificent Six (in reference to the Sinister Sextet) helped Zimmer in the compositions.However, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 is again a lesser adventure than it could be. It lacked the old lesson of ""less is more"" to guarantee a feature film in its total efficiency and with fewer questions that invalidate its potential. In the face of this gigantism and the poor choice in the subplots to be addressed, The Spectacular Spider-Man 2 is stuck for much of its narrative. The film only thrills once and for all in the beginning and also in the final stretch, when it gains apotheotic airs. It's time for the special effects show, the exciting battles and a good dose of courage, to the delight of those who know the story of the arachnid hero in the comics. Fun, well done and well acted, but with script problems, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 has great chances of repeating the success of the previous film."
" Visual effects are good, the plot is not good
",0.7003,0.9684,2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"I think this is a choice between small love and big love. Spider-Man's existence as a savior is his responsibility to put on ""clothes"", but he is only an ordinary person who takes off ""clothes"". He has the most ordinary feelings. The beautiful special effects scene has once again improved. In addition to the Gwen 's death, the storyline has not become the inherent ending of the American hero movie. There are too many main lines of character relationship, which is far from being able to fit a movie."
" Still better than baby face Maguire
",0.4404,0.9984,2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Well it seems the hate for this sequel to the first rebooted Spider-Man is even more than the first film received. I really don't get it, the Raimi films were not that good, interesting or especially spectacular. Really people, Spider-Man 2 only gets the love it does because of the villains. Nothing to do with Raimi, Maguire, the script or anything else. Look, I get a lot of people have some love for Raimi's trilogy, but they were just not very fun films all round. The one thing this era has going for it (other than all the things I praised in the first film) is that it's fun! Sure a little over the top at times, but this is a superhero film. They are supposed to be fun and entertaining, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 delivers that in spades, even more than the first film did. Having got past the background and development you can get straight into the action so-to-speak.So The Amazing Spider-Man 2 opens up by showing us more details of what happened the night Peter was left with his aunt and uncle as a child. We see Richard Parker destroying and disabling various things before being locked out of Oscorp and having to flee. We then re-run the events (shorter version) of Peter being left and then we get to see the events unfold immediately after that (I won't go into details) and how events unfolded leading to their disappearance. I liked this segment as it gives us more back story on Peter's parents and Oscorp as well as letting us know that these events have not been forgotten and pushed to the back burner and dismissed. They are import as they hold the key to everything Peter is and everything ultimately Oscorp is too.The story begins fully in earnest with an immediate action scene. Spidey is enjoying himself in the skies above while swinging through the city (while also being late for his graduation) before learning of a police chase involving a stolen Oscorp truck. Naturally our favourite web-slinger swings into action and naturally chaos ensues. I have read in places that some people hate this whole introductory scene, citing Peter's selfishness about not caring much when it suits him about everyday normal folk. What they fail to realise is that, Peter is himself an average every day person, a teenager still in fact. What kind of attitude did they expect him to have? The same as Thor...or Iron man for that matter? The arguments are ridiculous. Regardless, Peter saves the day as every good superhero should do and just about manages to graduate on time (cue Stan Lee cameo).This then leads us into the meat and potatoes of the film. Peter's ability, or lack off to deal with his life on a personal level, a family level, relationships, understanding who he is, dealing with the guilt of breaking his promise to Gwen's (Stone) father and of course, being the cities web-slinging hero. Once again Garfield excels in his role. He is funny, arrogant, selfish, caring and loving the attention when in his suit. Garfield pulls it off brilliantly and I will say it again, so far ahead of Maguires acting skills it isn't even funny. This second film does have more action and visual set pieces but also has a lot more interaction going for it in terms of the people in Peter's life. The film also does a great job of humanizing Peter's character too, showing that in spite of everything else, he is still just a nerdy teen who has no clue what he actually wants or when, as like most people of his age, that seems to change on a daily if not hourly basis.We also have two new villains introduced this time round and personally they were the only real let downs in the films. Electro is fantastic and Foxx plays the character with a lot of gusto, I just feel he was a little underused or that his character could have been explained a little more or better. DeHaan is reasonable enough as Harry Osborn but feel his alter-ego comes on a little too quickly and far too late in the game to make any real difference other than a convenient and slightly contrived plot device. That being said, both play their parts well enough with what they are given to work with. While there have been complaints a plenty regarding both characters quick change to full on lunatic, let's be honest here folks, the villains in these kind of movies are never exactly the most well wired upstairs are they? They are all, in their own way, an olive short of a pizza, so a rapid decline into full on villain mode within the confines of a films run-time can mostly be forgiven.Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is once again a highlight of this series and her chemistry with Garfield is excellent. In a change from the first film, Aunt May's (Field) character has a lot more to do this time around and I personally thought the interaction between her and Peter was genuinely moving and funny at times. I guess just like any parent and child and they rub off each other wonderfully, much better than in the first film. The rest of the cast all do their job in an efficient manner. This sequel also (as hinted at before) delves into Peter wanting to find out more about his family and the connection to Oscorp. The scene where Peter finally starts to find out the truth and where he watches the 'Roosevelt' upload is very well done indeed and for an action superhero film it tugs at the emotions more than you might expect.Visuals and photography are top notch here and overall the CGI is very well done. One particular scene where Peter's web shoot turns into an outstretched hand was particularly awesome given the context of the film at that moment. Probably not the most difficult CGI job in the world to a professional but it was well done and made me think at the time 'damn that's pretty cool'. Audio is excellent all round and the colour and look of the film is perfect. Just like a real life moving comic book. The film is very visually pretty and nice to watch. Action scenes are well filmed (much better than the first) and the only real complain might be the sometimes slightly dodgy script, but that can be forgiven easily in this kind of film, we are not after all watching The Godfather. Which leads once again to my opening paragraph. The film is just a great deal of fun all round.To sum up, the film is not the mess that many critics and paying fans made it out to be. Easy to follow and with a simple enough story-line. Once again Garfield shines as Peter Parker and it is a real shame that Sony will never be finishing this new trilogy due to finally coming to an arrangement with Marvel to allow our beloved Spidey to appear in the MCU. The second part of this bad news is that Andrew Garfield's services were not retained and I personally feel that Marvel missed the boat there, unless there was some contractual reason behind that. A new branching story-line or even continue the third planned film as a full Marvel production perhaps, it's a real shame that didn't happen.If I could give this a an extra quarter of a star I would as it isn't a four star by a long shot, but neither does it deserve to be three and a half either. Excellent fun superhero feature if that is what you are into (and don't still hold onto Raimi's films like a jilted lover). Once again, sorry Sam.

" Pleasant to watch, weak story but I like it (7.5)
",0.5346,0.9159,2020-01-16 00:00:00,8,"First of all, it was a pleasant film, although it received a lot of bad reviews I think we can say a good movie. Much better in terms of visual effects compared to the previous spiderman series, of course, the reason for this is the difference in years.If we look at the beginning of the film briefly I liked the first plane scene in the first film they continued the subject.
later battle scenes visual effects according to the first film did not develop much in terms of, in fact, the biggest difference of amazing spiderman we watched too many spiderman, but I didn't see much of peter parker's own life so I think the first three Spiderman movies more beautiful than this series.
just focus on the action and forget the Peter Parker I felt like Peter Parker was just investigating his family.I didn't like the bad character it should be used another bad character in my opinion instead of Electro.
Harry Osborn was also a very short battle scene as the goblin came to the last scene of the film, and it seems to me that they wanted to keep it in the sequel, just like they had a preview and we don't enough see harry and peter friendship.They've skipped too many topics and focused more on the action instead I think they could have done better than the first series."
" one of the worst superhero movies ever
",-0.6249,-0.9944,2020-01-09 00:00:00,1,"Of course there are other contenders, like Steel and Fant4stic... but this movie had a high budget and a dedicated fanbase and it still was a failure by all definitions of the word. The writing was terrible and awkward, as if the actors were improvising every line without knowing what the plot was about, and for some strange reason characters say the same lines twice in a row which is very irritating. Harry Osborn just shows up without even being mentioned in the first film, and the audience is supposed to just go along with him and Peter being best friends since childhood... so there's that. Also we're thrown into some hackneyed, underdeveloped subplot about Harry trying to steal Spiderman's blood to cure himself of a genetic disease that his father kept secret from him until he was on his death bed because he hates him I guess? Apparently this disease makes green goo leak out of your hairline and gums, which I guess was one of those comic book plots that would be really difficult to adapt in a movie without it appearing ridiculous because it appears very, very ridiculous. Another really dumb subplot is Peter's father leaving him a big ol' scavenger hunt to solve in order to learn whatever. I forgot what is at the end of the scavenger hunt because the last ""clue"" is a coin that Peter puts in an abandoned subway terminal, causing a car that his dad mechanically rigged to come up out of a secret hole in the ground, and I think there was a working laboratory inside or something really stupid like that. Oh yeah and Electro is in this movie too, not the Electro from the comics but just some weird guy who has a random love/hate relationship with both Spiderman and attention, and gets free orthodontic work from some electric eels (I could make this stuff up if I suffered enough brain damage, but I assure you it all really happens in the movie). They even try to shoehorn in the Sinister Six as sequel-fuel, which made me laugh while watching this because nearly every scene in this movie was a nail in the coffin of Garfield's turn as Spiderman. The only decent part of this movie is when Peter is crying over Gwen's dead body, then it immediately reverts back to its true form: a terrible, clumsy, boring, awkward mess of a film."

" Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino are the enemies
",-0.4939,0.996,2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"This is a movie, or a sequel, that delivers. It was a very good movie - The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The story was very interesting. I like how the movie introduces the new villains, and they are a favourite for many, especially the Rhino. It was great to finally see Rhino appear though the only thing I don't like about Rhino is the way it looks. It would've been better had it looked like the one in the animated series. But we only saw a small glimpse of the Rhino which is fine for this movie. Another villain is the Electro, who happens to be the main villain in this movie. The story for Electro is amazing. Electro made this movie succeed. I also like the soundtrack of Electro - that was so cool! It was great to see two completely new villains (Electro and Rhino), and this is why I found the movie so good. It isn't boring - The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I was upset regarding the story of Gwen Stacey, and it really didn't have to be like that, and I feel the movie would've been more better had it been different regarding the story. It would've been better had Gwen still been around. There's another villain called the Green Goblin who happens to be Spiderman's biggest enemy. I liked how it appeared in this ""Amazing"" Spider-Man story. Somehow, this movie worked, but the amazing thing is that it could've been more better. I really liked the beginning and final parts especially the ending. I liked the way this movie was going basically. The ""Amazing Spider-Man 2"" was a very good sequel apart from a few things."

I agree with a lot of what people say. But personally I love this movie. I found it so much fun to watch. The character's shine so much on screen. Dane Dehaan is perfect as the green goblin. I think problems arise from the marketing showing the entire film which I avoided thankfully. Gwen and Peters relationship is so real it was almost like improv which it more than likely was.Go in with an open mind. Enjoy it. Suspend your disbelief for two hours or whatever.

Visually grand, with excellent CGI and sound effects, but lacks effective plot and performance-capable characters.This movie is the sequel to the 2012 movie, once again centered on the figure of Spiderman. Here, young Peter Parker is very torn between Gwen's love and the fear that her action as a punisher might endanger her. Then comes a new super villain (well, the whole story about him really didn't convince me, especially when he hates Spider-Man), and it all happens too fast from there.As in the first movie, the characters are superficial and the plot is undeveloped. The cast can't shine, because they didn't give you material for it. To some extent, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are saved for their good romantic match. The fast pace of the film and the way events run over allow no developments or delays. The film is clearly focused on the use and abuse of CGI and quality visual and sound features. Undoubtedly, they are remarkable, but they do not justify the film, which is full of dramatic and psychologically profound moments that the plot then completely wastes to the detriment of the action, CGI and show-off, which is really worth seeing. .Of all the movies about Spider-Man, I think this must be the worst, or one of the worst."

There was like twenty sub-plots going on at the same time. Why did they put the Rhino in all of the trailers but only have him in the movie for thirty seconds. The actor for the green goblin is the worst actor in any movie I've seen. Also spider-man doesn't act like spider-man. What happened to the time when he beat Bonesaw. Do not watch this ever skip to spider-man homecoming featuring fat funny man and Vulture.

" The Amazing Spider-Man Expansive Film Universe (2012-2014)
",0.5859,0.8496,2019-09-03 00:00:00,9,"Who are we? What do we have to do? What is the purpose of our life? Existential and essential questions that this second episode of the brief Amazing Spider-Man Expansive Film Universe (2012-2014) answers. With a level of quality worthy of the first (9/10) and third (9/10) episode of the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy (2002-2007). Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, in the roles of Spider-Man / Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, are just as excellent as Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Jamie Foxx embodies an Electro / Max Dillon who is both sober and electrifying (According to the actor, the make-up part was the most difficult phase during filming). Dane De Haan compares to James Franco as Harry Osborn / Green Gobelin. The only disappointment is that Sony cancelled the sequels and spin-offs because they transferred Spider-Man to the MCU in 2015. Even though MCU's Spidey movies are great too!"
" Too much villains
",-0.6597,0.7507,2019-09-01 00:00:00,7,"To start it of, the movie had too much villains that we're shown. The main villain Electro had poor motives to actually be an antagonist. Villains like the famous Green Goblin was also shown though lacks screen time; and lastly Rhino, it really did disappoint me when they actually showed Rhino in the trailer knowing that he will actually be one of the villains but then again he was only shown in the last part with actually no action time. Other notable characters were introduce like Felicia Hardy, Alistair Smythe. One good thing to say about the movie though is that the fight scenes were really well thought of. Spider-Man was pretty amazing in terms of it."
" Too many hands in the pot.
",0.0,0.9995,2019-08-31 00:00:00,7,"Following the release of the first Amazing Spiderman film in the summer of 2012, it was no surprise that Sony Pictures, producer Avi Arad and director Marc Webb began working on a sequel and given the strong box-office numbers the film pulled in, it showed that the webhead could stand on his own as a film property, independent from the greater Marvel universe. With this temporary success in mind, Sony made it evident that they had no plans to let Spiderman join the MCU thus while The Amazing Spiderman 2 was being made, Sony revealed release dates for two sequels with the intention supposedly being to move forward with a direct storyline akin to what Sam Raimi did with his Spiderman films. However, the plan changed yet again when Sony decided that the shared universe format that had worked so well for The Avengers would be applied to Spiderman and that The Amazing Spiderman 2 and its two sequels would be used as a starting point for various spin-offs. Thanks to the sudden shift from a contained story to a shared universe, director Marc Webb had his job cut out from him as The Amazing Spiderman 2 had a lot more to live to by the studio executives at Sony. Webb however, wanted to focus more on the plot point of Peter's parents but Sony wasn't playing ball here as they continuously twisted the script to tease more sequels and spin-offs which came at the cost of developing the story and its characters. Even Sony's CEO, Kaz Hirai supposedly had a hand in editing the film despite not having any experience in the field. The film was subject to a fair amount of behind-the scenes-middling from Sony and when the film opened on May 2nd, 2014, it was met with severely mixed reviews from both critics and audiences and was the lowest-grossing film out of the entire Spiderman filmography up to that point.Now, much like the first Amazing Spiderman film, my experience with The Amazing Spiderman 2 when it first came out is limited as comic book movies weren't my thing at the time so I never saw it in theaters. However, in early 2017 in preparation for seeing Spiderman: Homecoming, I decided to finally give the film a watch and much like the first film, there were elements that I enjoyed such as the acting and the musical score but many other aspects of the movie such as the story and characters left a lot to be desired in my eyes.The movie begins with Oscorp scientist, Richard Parker recording a message explaining his reasons for going into hiding. Later on, Richard and his wife, Mary are flying on a private jet when the two of them are attacked by an assassin and die in the ensuing plane crash. Years later, Richard's son, Peter Parker now fights crime in New York City as the hero Spiderman. After chasing a truck full of plutonium and apprehending the driver, Peter is able to make it just in time for his high-school graduation. While there, Peter breaks up with girlfriend, Gwen Stacy. Peter's childhood friend, Harry Osborne returns to New York to visit his dying father, Norman and upon his passing, Harry is named the new CEO of Oscorp. While working late one night, Oscorp employee, Max Dillon accidentally shocks himself and falls into a tank of electric eels and he becomes a supervillain. Now, with this new threat to face, Peter Parker now must don the mask to protect those he loves as more secrets about his own past resurface while more enemies begin to tear at Peter's world as it starts to crumble.
What is so unremarkable about The Amazing Spiderman 2 is how much it tries to feel like a comic book even if it isn't even close to having that kind of feel. Not that it's based on any of the Spiderman comic books themselves, even though there are numerous call-backs to memorable moments in the Spiderman mythos, even right down to the suit being pulled straight out of the comic pages rather than looking like a basketball like it did in the first Amazing Spiderman film. It isn't that Marc Webb is attempting to recreate the look and feel of a comic book as this isn't Ang Lee's Hulk or Into The Spiderverse, but instead, it again feels like Avi Arad and Sony bulling Webb at every turn to the point that Webb simply doesn't feel comfortable here as The Amazing Spiderman 2 feels more like a movie made by a committee rather than a movie with a story and characters the audience can be invested in and root for.Take all the blatant problems that the first Amazing Spiderman film had such as the plethora of set-up and subplots that go absolutely nowhere, the cringe-inducing plot advancements, the moronic subplot of Peter learning about his parents' past that does nothing for the story at hand and absolutely head-scratching details like how a high-school student is given access to classified corporate files or knowing how to restart a power plant and turns it all up to 11. Add to that, numerous plot points that are never brought up again, an overstuffed story with too many plot threads, an incompetent script, Sony breathing down Marc Webb's neck at every waking moment and a movie spending more time on starting a shared universe rather than focusing on the story that it should be telling and you're left with one fundamentally flawed film. Sure the film tries to tell its own story, but thanks to Sony micro-managing it to hell and back and a lackluster script curiosity of Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Kevin Pinkner, the story here just feel weighed down by too much focus on making the film something that it shouldn't be.At one point in the play, The History Boys, one of the characters says that history is just one thing after another. One can only envisage that Kurtzman, Orci, Pinkner and the editors of The Amazing Spiderman 2 might have that saying framed and on their desks, because it would seem that is their method of building a story is just to throw in one thing after another with no rhythm or reason to it. One could make the point that the scenes themselves are decently put together, but the various sub-plots and the various tones never really come together in a harmonious way but rather feel like they're fighting each other for attention and just clash continuously with nothing ever adding up with what the story wants to tell. Ultimately, it's fruitless in the end because when you get down to the core, The Amazing Spiderman 2 isn't really about anything. When it comes to the world of superhero movies, I adore ones that have great characters and that are able to tell a compelling story as well as provide an escape from real life, something that almost all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films have been able to do and this is true with many other superhero films. However, with The Amazing Spiderman 2, that is clearly not the case as the movie is more focused on setting up future films in Sony's shared Spiderman universe, only on occasion delivering on some kind of theme, but never consistently enough that it can fill the bare space at the film's heart. Once again, the beat of the film is so chopped up and broken that maybe there was a more consistent version of the film that was left on the cutting room floor, but I'm quite sure that much like Josh Trank's supposed original of Fant4sic, we'll probably never see that cut of The Amazing Spiderman 2 thanks to incompetent editing and Sony's typical meddling.There's something that can be said for using at least one movie in a franchise to set up your potential shared universe as both the Mummy reboot and Batman V. Superman attempted and failed to do just that and this is an issue that many films like them have suffered from as they try in desperation to ride the coattails of what The Avengers had already done so perfectly, but the clumsy way that Sony tried to achieve the world building in The Amazing Spiderman 2 makes the shared universe building in Iron Man 2 look certainly delicate by comparison. Now, if a movie can create a world from the ground up and make it feel organic and lived-in, then that's perfectly fine. Hell, this is something many big movies have tried to do since the release of Star Wars and for the most part, almost all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films have even been able to pull off the perfect balance between including easter eggs for fans of the comics and also letting the films be their own thing. But in The Amazing Spiderman 2, Sony executives and Avi Arad feel the need to throw everything and the kitchen sink into the movie. Given how the character of Electro feels more like a side note rather than having an actual purpose in the film and Harry Osborne only becomes the Green Goblin towards the end of the film much like Venom did in Spiderman 3, the story in the film like it's trying to fire on all cylinders, rushing towards a third Amazing Spiderman film where Sony, the writers, Avi and even Marc Webb would have said that is where all the cool stuff will happen rather than focusing on what is happening in the movie itself and there's an even bigger problem even if Webb had made a third Amazing Spiderman film. By associating the creation of the villains along with Spiderman to Oscorp and Harry, the possibilities that the shared universe has are made small and trivial. Sony attempting to develop numerous films from the Spiderman cannon already felt like complete insanity and given how underwhelming The Amazing Spiderman 2 was, the further projects that Sony has lined up after Venom doesn't make me feel any more optimistic about what they may unleash upon us particularly now that Spiderman has been yanked out of the MCU.One of the best things that divides the character of Spiderman from many of the other Marvel and DC superheroes is his blue-collar everyman quality. He's not a super-soldier, a billionaire in a high-tech suit of armor or a razor-clawed mutant with a healing factor, he's just an everyday nerdy kid who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time but ueses his powers for good simply because that's the kind of person he is.

Electro is an awful villain with a cliche origin story and a boring personality, the Green Goblin is even worse and Rhino only comes twice I believe. The subplot with Spiderman's parents is stupid and boring. The movie has good actors whose performances are just underwhelming. The music is so bad, which sucks because you want a Spiderman movie to have really cool music or at least ok music. The only good parts were, like in the amazing Spiderman, the scenes between Gwen and Peter.

" Great Villians shame about the rest
",0.25,0.9908,2019-07-11 00:00:00,5,"This was very messy, if it wasn't for the second half of the movie this would garbage. For the first half we get, a reason Pete's parents left, introduction and origin of Electro, Harry Osborn introduction, showing Oscorps inner evil, what Aunt May, Gwen and Peter's relationship woes and a 15 minute action sequence that adds nothing to the film. There is so much crammed into the first half I'm surprised I didn't get whiplash, some of the set up works like Harry, Electro and Oscorp but the rest is just so unnecessary. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy Peter's parents but it actually set the ending up in quite a smart way, the action sequence was good as well but apart from kind of connecting to the ending doesn't add anything the narrative of the movie. There are some weird things in here like the relationship with Gwen, it worked so well in the first one their chemistry was on fire but here it just felt very clunky and didn't really mesh too well with what they portrayed in the first. Gwen is given a little bit more to do but much like the action sequence it doesn't really add much to the movie, there are other way to show their feelings.I will say Jamie Foxx was awesome, granted what he was given wasn't the best. His character takes a massive leap for no reason but there is never a dull moment when he's on screen though, he just chews the scenery. Dane Dehaan does similar thing but there isn't a negative with anything he does in fact I'd say he's probably the best written character. Which is weird because he was such a vital part of the original trilogy, you'd think seeing him again wouldn't be compelling but it was. There two are easily the reason to watch this, everything else is just fairly ok with some good parts.The ending of this was fantastic, it gets me every time. Just wished they'd mixed this and the alternative together then it'd bring 2 subplots to a close nicely instead of having to choose between the 2. That's a small gripe as it only effects 2 minutes of the ending overall but doesn't subtract from it too much.Much like Spider-Man 3, there was a lot of studio interference they wanted to do one thing whilst Marc Webb wanted to do something else. This could have been great if they had let him take the reins, shame though as they just over stuffed the movie with fluff."

" Some How Worse Than The First
",-0.4767,-0.8871,2019-05-18 00:00:00,2,"Somehow worse than the last film. Peters parents have not been very large in comics and haven't really blown up in the stories they've been in. It was an intriguing thought. But the way they used him was so inadequate. They said that Richard Parker specifically made it so that the powers could have only affected Peter. This is really annoying and I honestly think Stan Lee would hate this movie. When Stan Lee created Spider-Man (Miles Morales, Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy) his intention was to create a character where anyone was able to get bitten and become a superhero like race, gender, sexuality, beliefs. And this film decides to crap on Stan Lee and makes it so that it was Peter's destiny to become Spider-Man. They even made a whole film based around it - Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse. Peter Parker had a soft change. Not a big thing, just a minor nitpick. Andrews voice for Parker is a New Yorker accent, and this movie it got more aggressive. But unless you watch the movies immediately back to back it is quite unnoticeable.They have improved Spider-Man but now he is more Deadpool than Spider-Man. What I mean by this is that he goes with more making people laugh than saving people. So an example is at the very start of the film is when he starts to annoy Rhino but instead of stopping him he just makes jokes. Especially since you see him rampaging and killing people on the street. He has improved but they replaced the fact that he was a criminal in the last film, with Deadpool like personality. Every scene with Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield made me want to rip my eye out. They were boring and repetitive. They were both quite. Them two in the same scene acting wise has not really improved.The beginning was probably the best ever shot I have seen in a film. The cinematography in the flick was incredible. There are so many plot holes in the film. People are running upstairs which at the end of them are blocked, and they ran to get away from the bad guy. Green Goblin is ill and his father is just dying and same with his grandfather. In that logic that means to any simple-minded human being, he would die at the same age as his father. There were three antagonists in the movie and that's if you count Rhino as one. I liked Rhino and that was it, although I hate how much of him they used. He is a big part of Marvel comics. Electro and Goblin are both dumb. So Electro's origin was fine but his intentions were unclear.And the thing that was so unintentionally funny was that when he was getting his power in a fish tank. His tooth gap disappeared as his teeth attracted towards each other with electricity. And there was so much earnestness that went into that 5 seconds moment. Green Goblin had a bad actor, looks when he turned into the Goblin, and his character development could have been grown more. The reason I thought the Rhino was so great was the CGI concept and the actor. People say there were too many villains. I think it's fine but to make it work, you have to develop them all together otherwise it turns into a villain origin story. The audio was as I said, the same as Amazing Spider-Man 1. The ending was actually good because I'm tired of Emma and Andrews relationship with their characters. The end fight was also great. The end credit scene left me excited despite the fact that we won't get a third. The ending also showed the Rhino in a huge suit and fired rockets at Spider-Man. And somehow he redirects the rockets towards innocent people. The bad things I said despite how many there are, are a very big deal. So that explains the rating."
" Not as good as Spider-Man 2 and Homecoming...
",-0.3412,0.6124,2019-05-15 00:00:00,1,"The only good thing is Electro, and that's it. Skip this turd of a movie and watch the MCU spiderman saga as well as the Macguire films."
" How Embarrassing!!!
",-0.5386,-0.9969,2019-05-12 00:00:00,2,"Here's the sequel of Marc Webb's The ""Amazing"" Spider-Man. And guess what guys: It's a really HUGE disappointment. I don't like most of this movie. It's not like Spider-Man 3, it's way worse. Sony had gone too far, leaving bad performances behind for audiences to see.We got Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx as Electro, Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin. The performances were really bad, really really bad, especially the villains. There's Paul Giamatti playing the Rhino and he was completely the worst. The screenplay is a total disaster. They were too easy and really childish. Emma Stone didn't take her role seriously on being Gwen Stacy, she's just...boring like ""Nobody makes my decision, I'm Gwen Stacy"" and she's dead. What a stupid decision. Another stupid part in here is Electro, the policemen were morons, complete idiots. They didn't even listen to Spider-Man saying that Max Dillon is a good guy. Even the crowd were complete morons as well. Are they deaf? Didn't they hear what their hero's trying to say? WTF!!! I hate those scenes. Jamie Foxx being Electro is hilarious, noting dark and evil.The only things I liked about this movie is the costume. It's a lot better than the previous one, it's awful but this one looked like a real Spider-Man with big white eyes. Also there's a scene when a kid is bullied and Spider-Man came and made the bullies away and talked to the kid. That scene made Spidey more like Spidey.The CGI and fightings are okay, but they're not epic at all. Most scenes were forgettable and really boring. I really don't like them, like when Electro playing the Itsy Bitsy Spider song. Hans Zimmer was really dumb putting dubstep on this and electro went like ""Today's my birthday, time to light up my candles!"". The plot was really not cool, especially when Harry Osborn went like ""I want your blood, Spider-Man"". This is not a disappointing movie but it's kinda worse. Like I said, it's not even as good as Spider-Man 3. When the Green Goblin was knocked out and when we saw him in prison, how could he change back to himself? And I felt like when Gwen Stacy wanted to help Peter Parker defeating Electro, at least she should've said ""Spider-Man need help too!"" like MJ in Spider-Man 2 or 3 (I don't's remember).I really don't like this movie. It's really terrible, except for a few parts. This is for sure one of the worst Spider-Man movies I've ever seen. This movie had proved that the CGI and fights are better, but it had also proved that sequels could sometimes be a big mess.Ratings: 5.4/10"
" Unfortunate sequel
",-0.4588,-0.7351,2019-03-30 00:00:00,3,"Plainly said, poor secondary casting, poor writing."
" A heavily-glittered Greeting Card with no Meaningful Text.
",0.4019,-0.9665,2019-03-24 00:00:00,4,"I'll be candid, I didn't watch this movie at one go - which may be an argument against the movie itself. Having just watched the first film, I wanted to see how the 2nd one continued the story. Watching it in 2019, my expectations from this sequel were at bay as I had already known of the mixed response to this film.Things started off okay as the opening scene with spider-man came along. The visuals were much brighter than the first one, the suit much more faithful to the comics, and the spider-man seemed more quippy.Of course, Paul Giamatti's character (who wasn't Rhino yet) already gave me a sense that the villains in this film were not to be taken seriously - given their somewhat-nonsensical actions, the motivations thereof, and even just the dialogue delivery being synonymous to the 'pure evilness' of villains - who did things just to 'be evil'.The opening scene was further intercut with a scene where Peter's high-school batch were graduating, and Gwen giving a speech as the valedictorian. The way these two scenes were intercut felt incoherent and without motivation other than to show these two events occurring simultaneously.This incoherency also gave me a sense that the film and its plot were to follow the same suit.There's no denying that Electro's character had really no development or motivation to do what he does in the film. The character went from being a caricature of a nerdy Spider-man admirer straight to becoming a caricature of being a Spider-man hater without any formidable reason other than ""Spider-man did not remember my name.""Speaking of which, all the villains in this movie are just caricatures of the evil, up-to-no-good villains prevalent in action movies before the 80s, comic books and even story books written for children.Everything about them was unfortunately repulsive - the performances, their non-existent arcs or character development, and their insignificant relevance to the protagonist, story and plot.I stopped watching the movie right before the Electro boss fight, as I already knew by that point what would happen in the story later on. There was no reason for me to continue watching the film, as I wasn't keen on watching Electro (given his character's poor development and execution), neither did the film make me care enough to see Spider-man defeat him.The role of Gwen felt rather ambiguous and vague, as though her only purpose was to be a token romance character for Peter to care for. Her motivations for doing certain things had no weight for justifying her existence in this film other than to simply set up her (SPOILER) death at the end.Coming to Hans Zimmer's score, I actually liked the dubstep score of the Electro fight - despite the fact that Electro 'making' that music made absolutely no sense. But the score did add some needed tension onto the CGI-heavy fight between Spidey and Electro.On the other hand, Zimmer composed a special theme for Spiderman which rightly gives off a 'hopeful' vibe, but the theme itself is overused in the movie to the point that its' impact diminishes with every use of it.On a positive note, I have a somewhat special connection to the final few scenes (except the futile Sinister Six setup). Being in a dark moment of my own life, I could somewhat relate to Peter going through his period of grief and finally getting over it. This credits solely to Andrew Garfield's performance, since the screenplay added nothing to make me feel for him.In a scene where Peter watches a video of Gwen's valedictorian speech, a particular line struck a chord with me:""It's easy to feel hopeful on a beautiful day like today, but there will be dark days ahead of us too. There will be days where you feel all alone, and that's when hope is needed most.""Although, the way the speech ended up in Peter's laptop made no sense, since there weren't any cameras shown to record her speech in the graduation the way it was shown in the laptop.The ending scene with Rhino had only one good thing - Peter finally getting up from his state of grief to fight back.Other than that, the scene was terrible overall - Paul Giamatti's 'crazed' performance, the way it was shot with shaky cam and abrupt zoom-in shots, the CGI of Giamatti inside the Rhino suit, and the convenience of no casualties suffered (especially among the cops) despite the enormity of Rhino's attack.Even Peter's motivations of becoming Spider-man again was very sudden and poorly shown, intercutting between him looking at his suit, smiling and the Rhino making an appearance. Peter conveniently became Spider-man at the same time as the Rhino wreaks havoc, having no correlation between the two.In my opinion, what would have made the scene better was to show the escalating tension of the Rhino wreaking havoc, and this resulting Peter in having to return as Spider-man to save the city that relies on him.Apart from that, the film consists of several sub-plots and setups that are incredibly futile in the primary plot-line - the pointless and shoddy set-up of Sinister Six, the disappearance of Peter's parents, the inclusion of Norman & Harry Osborn and the possible separation of Peter and Gwen.Overall, I can say that the film is somewhat like an insignificant greeting card - all shine and glitter without any valuable or meaningful text to it. The characters and overall story lacked depth and relevance that had potential to the film more compelling, resulting in the audiences not being able to care about anyone or anything in the story.....which explains why Sony decided to move on and finally collaborate with Marvel on the character, a move we're all grateful for."
" A weak but fairly entertaining sequel
",0.4404,-0.9602,2019-03-15 00:00:00,6,"Despite lingering doubts about the necessity of a reboot, the Amazing Spider Man was a resounding success and it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. Well now it's here, and it's a fun movie that will please a lot of audiences, but it's not as good as it could have been or as the last movie was. This is not to say that ASM 2 is another Spider Man 3, which was itself not as terrible as a lot of people remember it being. ASM 2 has great acting and heart pumping action, and at no point does it induce cringes or bad laughter, it's just that it tries to do more than it should and not all the pieces fit together perfectly.This installment picks up roughly where the last left off, with Peter fighting crime as Spider Man while struggling to choose between his love for Gwen Stacy and his promise to her dying father. Unanswered questions still linger about his parents as well, and but it's developments within Oscorp that pose the greatest threat as a freak accident turns mild mannered underdog Maxwell Dillon into the powerful villain Electro and Harry Osborn's search for a cure to the disease which killed his father drives him in increasingly dark directions.The movie's strong point is its acting. Despite being a Brit, James Garfield perfectly fits the role of goofy all American teenager Peter Parker. He's more than a bit nerdy, often awkward, and spouts quips and cheesy one liners like a pro. Leading lady Emma Stone is just as good. Plucky, intelligent, and undeniably cute, she makes the perfect sidekick/love interest for Peter. Buoyed by the exceptional chemistry befitting their real life relationship, their scenes together make for one of the better on screen teen romances of recent years, and it would have been nice if this element had been played up more.The bad guys also make quite the impression. Jamie Fox seems like an odd choice to play Electro, but he works. As Maxwell Dillon he's so pathetic, so earnest, so downtrodden at every turn that you can't help feel sorry for him. But when he decides that he's had enough of being kicked around and gains the power to do something about it, he gets downright scary. Dane DeHaan also puts in good work as Harry Osborn. Not as charismatic or as versatile as James Franco was, he nonetheless is more brooding, calculating, and borderline obsessive, making him a more convincing Goblin.Now for the bad. The main problem with the movie is that there are simply too many characters and subplots. Most of plot threads are well written and contribute to the main narrative, but together they give the runtime a cluttered feel and the transitions between them are often somewhat rough. The start- or perhaps I should say resumption- of Peter's search for the truth about his parent's death is particularly abrupt and oddly timed. At times the plot also relies on characters making incredibly stupid decisions, but given their circumstances I suppose their choices are plausible.Now I'm afraid I can't continue any further without getting into spoiler territory, so consider yourself warned. Fans have known that it was only a matter of time until Gwen Stacy died tragically, and this is that time. Her death, at the hands of the Green Goblin of course- was well handled, the modest changes to the circumstances taking nothing away from its impact. Yet I can't help shake the feeling that in a movie featuring her famous death scene, it should be the main villain who kills her. Her death should be the climax of Spider Man's last fight with the Green Goblin, not the first. I just hope the filmmakers will use this as the basis of a bitter feud with the Goblin.While the movie has a very good ending, it fails to recognize it as such and continues with another fifteen minutes of material that would have been better left to the first act of the next movie. Despite its very real and sometimes serious faults, I still mostly enjoyed Amazing Spider Man 2 and wouldn't have minded another instalment. Overall it's not the home run its predecessor was, but as a fun summer action movie it mostly works."

",0.0,0.5547,2019-03-06 00:00:00,2,"Dear lord this was just one painful minute after another. The only truly redeeming part of this haphazard sequel was the casting of Jamie Foxx as Electro. His performance is stellar amidst (and in spite of) the drudging script and an ensemble of cringe-worthy performances from the rest of the cast. But that's really all it has going for it. The graphics aren't much better or any more believable than the first ""Amazing Spiderman"" of which this is based. I appreciated the overall plot line somewhat, but not enough to suggest that anyone else subject themselves to the 2+ hours of torture. This movie, in fact, isn't even good enough to have playing in the background while you are working on something else and aren't even paying attention to it. I actually would like to keep writing about how bad this movie really is, but I keep getting more and more worked up as I go along, and I'm afraid I might blow a fuse in my brain if I get bent out of shape any further. Moral of the story: Amazing Spider-Man 2: Twice the amount of Un-Amazingness."
" Interestingly terrible
",-0.1027,0.7091,2019-02-26 00:00:00,5,"Director Marc Webb is not the one to blame for this travesty of a superhero flick, nor is Andrew Garfield, I blame Sony for their awful attempts at a cinematic universe, and their constant product placement where I played a game of pointing out how many Sony products there were. The story is lackluster, and has so many plot-points that are either dropped, or go nowhere. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Spider-man is much more lighthearted and fun but confusing on his motivations. The story continues from the also dropped plot points of the first Amazing Spider-man movie and does nothing satisfying nor entertaining with it. Jamie Fox's Electro is the only fun part, he tries his best with the dumb cartoonish character he is given. The green goblin is a wasted villain who only exists to be put on the poster, as with Rhino who is awful and cartoony in this film. The music is awful, Hanz Zimmer doesn't seem like he put any effort into the score, and Pharell Williams puts out of place songs everywhere. The special effects are amazing with the Spider-man web slinging shots looking the most realistic, and are overall fun. The plot is dumb, the writing is atrocious, but it's the best looking Spider-man movie ever made. This film has a little bit of style, but no substance. If you're a die-hard Spider-man fan, than just turn your brain off, or watch it out of curiosity."

The fight scenes. . . Yes they was good like the first one against electro and spiderman was good and all but i don't understand this movie got so much hate.

It's a confectionary creation that's likely to drive kids wild, and plenty of adults, too. As an adult, I've rarely fallen victim to my inner 10 year-old, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" consistently broke down the critical barriers that I've honed throughout the years. It's a sugar rush of a film and, quite simply, I liked what it did to my brain. It's often not able to see past its own nose, content to exist forever in the moment, but it's popcorn filmmaking in its purest form, and Marc Webb deserves all the credit in the world for making such a delectable cinematic cake from a line of incongruous ingredients.

",0.128,-0.9754,2018-12-21 00:00:00,5,"The Amazing Spiderman 2 is my guilty pleasure movie. It's so hilariously weird and absurd. In the beginning we get Paul Giamatti yelling absolute gibberish hilariously, while there's like 30 police cars which crash all on each other. I mean Spiderman literally jokes around while people die.However this movie also has some great stuff. The returning cast is still great, and I think we got the best Spider-man in this film. His suit is the most accurate and looks the best out of all the movies. He's cracking jokes moderately, while still staying serious when he needs to be (for the most part...). He's also clearly capable, and smart. This is how Spider-man should be.If I'd have to say some genuinely great things about this movie would be the music and visuals. The visuals are gorgeous and the cinematography makes it all better. The music is also really great, having ominous music for Harry, and (my personal favorite) dubstep theme for Electro.The villains are a mixed bag. The Rhino is barely in the movie and he's just silly screaming.Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) was pretty good. However I don't think we got enough development for his character, and once he turns into Green Goblin not only does he look horrific, but he becomes completely insane, laughing like a literal mad man, and it ruined the character a little for me. The movie rushes to make us care for him, and rushes Peter's friendship with him. I mean in the last movie peter went to oscorp, Harry's company, and there's no mention. Their friendship should've been set up previously or established in the last movie. He has the motivations, he's dying and his father (who has this Hereditary disease?! And is green?! That is also weird...) who has neglected him his entire life, tells him he's literally dying, and is giving him the company, whilst Donald Menken is trying to take the company away from him by framing him. It's overwhelming for him. I think he could've been perfectly set up for the next film, but it was rushed for this one. Also it took 40 years for his father to die, I don't get why he's so upset, he has a few decades to live. Rushing him also made us get peter unfortunately have to email J. Jonah Jameson being reduced to an appearance via email, so Peter could have the relation ship with Spiderman needed for Harry. I also thought his transformation to ""The Goblin"" didn't really make sense, and his suit is saving him now despite his father saying they have no cure yet? I did like Harry, but he was very rushed and Green Goblin looks disgusting.Electro (Jamie Foxx) was, in my opinion, actually really good. I loved Jamie Foxx's performance and the look. Electro's motivations are perfect, and to top it all off he is schizophrenic, so it maximizes everything for him. Everyone is always either making fun off him, or ignoring him, and he's dying for attention. Not only that, but he's constantly neglected and his work was literally stolen, but he's afraid to speak up, because then he believes people will like him even less. We get him imagining our burst of what he wants to do, and I think this is a great way to show the pain he's going through. AND ITS HIS BIRTHDAY. Also he's a huge Spiderman fanatic and he gets saved by him. Spiderman of course being a nice guy tells Max he needs him. Max of course takes this literally and when he actually meets Spiderman again (after he's gotten his powers in a very silly way) It's the perfect time to get him against him, and I thought it was done in a great way. Max looks for the area with the most electricity and goes there. It's a very crowded place of course. People seeing what he's doing are afraid and the police intervenes. He doesn't know how to control his power and is scared himself, accidentally attacking the police. However he finally gets the spotlight, people actually ""see"" him, but Spiderman comes (already having forgotten his name) and takes the spotlight, and then despite Spiderman telling them to not shoot, they do shoot him, making him feel betrayed. In the his theme you hear him whispering to himself ""he lied to me, he shot at me, he hates on me, he's using me, he's dead to me, he is my ENEMY"" This is the point where his snap, the only thing he cared about has ""betrayed"" him. You might think it doesn't make sense, but he's schizophrenic, to him everyone is against him, and he now realized he can take them himself, he's a ""god"" to them. This was just perfect for me, and I think Electro was such a great villain. He just really worked for me, however I do wish we got more of him despite him actually having a lot of screentime.This movie also has another issue. It doesn't have a consistent tone. The movie begins with a jokey Spiderman, and a villain who's literally yelling gibberish, to the end of the movie where we get a horrifying, and disgusting goblin who literally kills Gwen, and Peter literally grabs her dead body and cries for 2 minutes, and it shows him going to her grave every day for the entire year. Like holy crap that is dark, and then at the end the screaming rhino guy is back?! What the hell?! I do think Gwen's death was really well done though. Emma Stone (Gwen) and Andrew Garfield (Peter) were actually dating at the time, and it shows, they have great chemistry. Gwen once again wasn't a one dimensional damsel in distress she actually does things, and when she does die it's actually sad. Just looking at Peter crying over her (great performance by Andrew Garfield) is just sad. Especially realizing that this was exactly what Gwen's father didn't want happening, and peter had promised.I also think that was done very well, with Peter suffering PTSD from his death, Uncle Ben's and Captain Stacy's death really carries to this movie.From this we also get some weird and stupid sub plot with Peter's Parents. Honestly having shown why Peter's parent left could've been great, but then we get this sub plot where peter literally gets a calculator from his bag, opens it, finds metro coins, goes to an abandoned subway and a train comes up from the ground revealing a video explaining everything, and to top it all off it turns out that Peter was special because he was the only person that the spider could've worked on. This just ruins Peter. He should be the average nerd, but now he's been special all along and destined for this? What if he never got bitten and the spiders did die?! It makes no sense and it's so dumb.There's a lot more I like and I dislike from this movie. The Easter eggs like having Felisha (Black Cat) and Alistar Smythe as actual characters in the movie being set up for the future is great, but then it's over done with literally showing the entire sinister six in a room.They also did something I really liked. Having set up things like over changing a battery when Peter tries to fix his web shooters, and saving the kid, coming back at the end. I thought it was done very well and it shows development for peter and other characters.I also did think this movie had some genuinely good dialogue.Despite having some great stuff, the movie does feel extremely stuffed, and it's a mess. Overall this film had a lot of great, but also a lot of bad. It felt rushed trying to set up the sinister 6, but it still managed to be an enjoyable movie, and get you excited for the future.

",0.6369,0.9953,2018-12-18 00:00:00,10,"Much like with Daredevil, this is a film where I really wanted to bring attention to just how unfairly maligned this film is. Thus, I'm going to structure it in a manner where I will mostly be directly addressing and debunking the various misconceptions and (In my opinion) shallow arguments that are made against it. It's also worth noting that, to date, it's my 3rd favorite Marvel comics film behind Spider-Man 2 and Into the Spider-Verse.Reason #1: ""Electro turns evil because Spider-Man forgot his name.""Starting off with stuff that's just objectively false, we have the complaint that Max Dillon loses it because Spider-Man couldn't remember his name. This is ludicrous. There's a good 2 minutes of very important content between Spider-Man forgetting Max's name and Electro beginning to snap. While Spider-Man, the only person who had shown Max an ounce of compassion or love in his entire life, forgetting his name was definitely hurtful, Max still puts his trust in Spider-Man to save him, agreeing to talk with him in a safe area away from civilians. Immediately upon putting his trust in Spider-Man, Max is shot by a trigger-happy sniper. When Max retaliates, Spider-Man subdues Max and saves the sniper. This leads to the entire city cheering and applauding Spider-Man while jeering, booing and insulting Electro. A man who has been mistreated by everyone he met nearly his entire life gets humiliated in front of one of the most densely populated cities in the United States by the only person he thought he could trust. So we have an abandonment complex, presumed decades of abuse and humilation/perceived betrayal by a loved one in front of a mass audience, and people still think Electro became a villain cause Spidey forgot his name?Reason #2: ""The film didn't know what tone it was going for.""It was going for the tone of the comics; a universe where lighthearted characters coping with dramatic and serious events. Just like the Spider-Man comics it's based on, it perfectly balances cheesy, fluffy comedy with heavy, emotional drama, using the former as a way of counterbalancing against the latter and making its impact hit all the harder. The best Spider-Man comics are the ones that start of amusing and comical and slowly ease their way into something more emotionally powerful and affecting. Peter's silly, goofy quips and cutesy, dorky dialogue with Gwen make the shock and weight of her tragic death at the clock tower all the more hard hitting.Reason #3: ""Gwen is useless and an idiot and responsible for her death.""The ""responsible for her death"" complaint is just flat out not true. She went to the power plant to stop Electro and succeeded (She's actually even more useful in defeating Electro than Spider-Man is, which pretty much negates the whole ""idiot"" complaint.) None of the characters, especially Gwen, has any way of knowing about Green Goblin at the time. As for ""useless"", she has a clear and well paced arc of coming to terms with her feelings for Peter, while still not letting her feelings for him control the direction of her life, and, like I said, defeats Electro in the film's climax. Now compare this to Michelle of Spider-Man: Homecoming, a plot device who solely exists for Peter to have a crush on and save as Spider-Man (And later to make the Vulture twist less shocking.)Reason #4: ""The film has no themes and too many subplots.""While the film has many subplots that may initially seem a bit overstuffed, they are all connected by the themes of the film; those being abandonment and hope. Peter feels abandonment from his parents, Electro feels abandonment from Spider-Man and both Harry and Gwen feel abandonment from Peter. Of all these characters, it's only Gwen who finds the hope and inner strength to push past her own abandonment and move on from it. It's in her death that we see Spider-Man find the hope he needs to persevere beyond his pain and mourning (A brilliant subversion of the ""women in the refrigerator"" trope inadvertently started by The Death of Gwen Stacy, the comic which the film is heavily based on), becoming the hero we all love and recognize as Spider-Man fans. Now that I mention it, Gwen is almost more the hero of the story than Spider-Man is.Reason #5: ""Peter is a whiny crybaby.""I really don't like this complaint, to be honest, as it reeks of toxically masculine concepts that ""men can't cry"" which shoulda died out a while ago, but look at what this Spider-Man suffers. He's dealing with a crisis of conscience with his relationship with Gwen, abandonment complexes from his parents leaving him, his best friend dying and the death of his girlfriend. He had every reason and more to cry.Reason #6: ""It spends too much time setting up future movies.""The only example of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 doing this is the scene with The Man in the Hat at the ending and MAYBE Felicia Hardy. That's it. And yes, that includes The Rhino. Rhino represents how Spider-Man's challenges are only going to get harder after Gwen's death, but how he must keep his own hope alive. Because his hope represents the city's hope. That's why Rhino starts the movie off as a common thug and ends it as a supervillain. Meanwhile, Homecoming shoves in/teases the Scorpion, The Prowler, Mary Jane Watson, Betty Brant, the Iron Spider and the Sinister Six, all of which have no connection to the narrative or themes of the movie, and yet it somehow gets a pass.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an emotional, funny and brilliant comic book movie that does a wonderful job tackling very serious real world issues like abandonment, hopelessness and mortality all within the framework of a painstakingly loving Spider-Man adaptation. It's a perfect encapsulation of everything I love about the Spider-Man story and one of the best superhero films ever."
" Goddamn it.....
",-0.4767,0.5722,2018-12-17 00:00:00,2,"The did so well on the first movie how did you screw this up?! All you had to do was be like ""What did they like from the first movie and what they didn't like."" It shouldn't be his difficult to make a Spider-Man movie. There is so much wrong with this movie. Why did Peter not know who Oscorp was but secretly knew the heir since childhood? Why are you so damn fixated on Peter's parents even though everyone likes the concept of this can happen to anyone? Why are you making Spider-Man 3 look like The Godfather of spiderman's? Why is it so hard to make a Spider-Man movie?"
" Blue No Longer
",-0.296,0.9683,2018-12-13 00:00:00,8,"181212: Wow, I feel a bit blue about neglecting my comic book roots but not as blue as Jamie Foxx's Electro. Though I'm a huge fan of the old yellow and green version, Foxx took over the reigns of this Spider-Man adversary giving him an unexpectedly fun, yet murderous energy. Great seeing Sally Field again, she stole this boys heart in 1977 and is as beautiful as ever. Finally, this review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the new Rhino (Paul Giamatti). Out of the gate, I wasn't impressed with this mechanical wonder but when he started to run on all fours, my only question was; where is the sequel? I need to see more of this horned beast. Poor old Goblin, overshadowed by his own creations. Fun times found when I needed it most."

As from my review u could probably got an idea that I'm the one of the die-hard fan of SPIDY and offcourse the PAIR of ANDREW & EMMA....Screenplay was damm good, and storyline was also pretty much acceptable as far as what one who had read the comic of ""Death of Gwen Stacy"". The Chemistry between the 2 lead was just charming, and everlasting..
The Movie also holds the feeling ""hope"" in a emotional manner. Although the screenplay for one of the villain Electro was not that glorified but was still acceptable. Simply touched the heart of every Spidy's Fan."

",-0.6652,-0.34,2018-11-22 00:00:00,10,... story is not complete this is annoying we want part 3
" Great chemistry
",0.6249,0.9874,2018-11-20 00:00:00,8,"I really like this film. And not for the obvious reasons, the action, the fx, the humour...
I liked it for allowing a relationship that actually feels genuine. My favourite scenes are the ones where Andrew Garfield interacts with Emma Stone and/or Dane de Hahn. In these scenes the director Webb proves that he's great at portraying twenty-somethings.
The chemistry between Garfield and Stone is real and that comes across nicely. I actually cared for them and wanted them to be together. Not to spoil anything, but in the end I couldn't help but cry. Not having read the comic books and steering clear of certain online platforms, I didn't know what would happen and was shocked. All those deaths at the end of Infinity War didn't mean that much to me because I don't have any emotional connection to most of them. This was different.Finally, in my humble opinion, Andrew Garfield is the best actor having played Spiderman. Toby Maguire was likeable, sure. But there were scenes where he 'acted' too much. With Garfield it all feels more natural. Tom Holland is fun. But that's it.So come for the fun, come for the action. Stay for the characters and their chemistry."
" Nice visuals, a great soundtrack and a solid Spider-Man movie!
",0.8313,0.9894,2018-11-16 00:00:00,7,"Since this movie was released I've seen it a couple of times. And I always come to the same conclusion, this wasent bad at all.
Garfield does a solid Spider-Man. It's not the same ""nerdish and a little shy like"" version as Tobey Maguire did, but instead it's a more straight forward Spider-Man/Peter Parker that feels a bit more modern at times. The old trilogy is classics already by all means, but this one felt more visual pleasing somehow.
The chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone is still there. Sure the story of one of the bad guys played by Jaime Foxx felt a bit too much to maybe make me sympathize with him turning over to the darkside. But then again with great powers comes maybe too much responsibility for some right? Some people just can't handle the power. We can still understand his motives so it doesnt take much away from the action. And this movie felt really great when it comes to visally upgrading the action scenes, making spidey more visually stunning with it's more colorfull visuals then maybe ever before.
I also think Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn felt alot better then the original trilogys version that felt flat and childish. This one had depth and his own motives and struggles.
The soundtrack is another great one from Hanz Zimmer that adds another level of the emotions felt by the characters and the scenes.
All in all i think this one did alot better then people give it credit for. And it feels like a missed oppertunity not making a 3rd one. They had alot of potential moving forward from this one, without going into spoilers. Instead we ended up with a new Spidey that doesn't do it bad either but feels a bit too childish for my taste. This one felt more like a middleground suited for all ages, like it should be."
" Andrew Garfield ruined these movies

I don't understand why it gets hate. But this film was good and Andrew Garfield was a good Spider-man and did what he do best. 8/10. Sorry not sorry.
" I'm dying Peter
",0.0,-0.9977,2018-10-29 00:00:00,5,"I don't like this movie.
It's not good and that's something almost every film critic agrees on.
And gonna give my reasons to why it's bad.SPIDER-MAN
Spider-Man is way better in this movie than the last one.
He actually consistently cracks jokes but of course there is a problem with that.
First the jokes fall flat 98% of the time the jokkes Spider-Man throws around are the simplest jokes you can come up with and none of them are good.
There was one joke in the movie that made me chuckle and that was when Spider-Man teamed up with fire men to splash water on Electro.
It made me chuckle a bit but that was the only time the movie made me chuckle.
or sorry that was a lie there was this other scene when Harry said ""I'm dying Peter.""
That got me laughing.
Overall Spider-Man in the movie is a 6/10 in the last movie he was a 4/10 which is an improvement.CHARACTERS
Idk what to say about the characters.
i never liked any of them i never hated any of them.
Aunt may is still there to worry and be stressed about everything.
Gwen is now an independent wamen who can make her own decisions.
It's always a thing in these movies that when a character is supposed to die in the movie they make sure that they are there to die they don't have any other importance than to die.
And that's the same for Gwen stacy she is an independent wamen just so that she could die.
She gets herself into these crazy situations where she could die and her excuse is that she makes her own decisions.
Peter in this movie was fine i wish i have something to say about him but i don't so lets move on to the villains.VILLAINS
The villains are what made this movie so bad.
I don't even know Electro's motivation to kill Spider-Man or i think is that they are teasing him and they think that he is a monster and that is a weak motivation that never gets talked about or developed.
Electro is just has no personality.
But Harry he is probably worse.
He is a character that never got talked about in the last movie they never even said his name there and then they just say in the sequel.
""Yeah Peter and Harry where best friends they did a lot together:""
And it just blows my mind that they did that.
Harry has some personality which is good.
And his motivation for killing Spider-Man is that he needs his blood that motivation isn't completely bad and is in my opinion mediocre.
But when Harry turns into Green Goblin then he is a worse character but luckily we never got to see how bad Green Goblin could have been.ACTION
The action is way better in this movie it looks so cool and great but it's not really that creative or dose anything new.
They never do anything new with Spider-Man's combat skills in this franchise which leaves the action just mediocre.
This is a nitpick but why whenever Spider-Man is gonna fight some evil dude why do people watch him fight shouldn't the police make sure that the people are as far away from the crime as possible.
But anyway the action overall is mediocre.TONE
The tone is way more different in this movie and that's why i thought at the time that this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen.
I was dumb back then.
But i like the tone it's different and looks way more cooler but the movie is still badCGI
In my opinion the CGI looks amazing it's so beautiful to look at Spider-Man fighting the villains but that's another small thing i wanted to talk about.SUIT
The suit looks way better it doesn't look like a basketball this time and i would say it's one of the best Spider-Man suits.THE RELATIONSHIP
It's mediocre.
I like the scene where Peter and Gwen where talking about ground rules.
The topic of ground rules was stupid but the chemistry between them was good and it seemed genuine when they talked to each other.
But keep in mind that was the only scene where the chemistry showed cause the other scenes when they where together felt really empty they should have kept the chemistry between them consistent but they didn't.VERDICT
don't hate me for this but i like this movie more than the last one cause i hated the last movie.
This movie is bad and i wont deny that it's the worst Spider-Man movie but i liked it more than the last one and the reason is that i felt less annoyed about the flaws of this movie and i would rather watch this one than the first one.
But they should really just ignore the parents stuff about this movie cause that stuff is unnecessary.
Don't watch this movie"

",0.0,-0.9913,2018-08-16 00:00:00,1,"Before I continue this review, I just want to warn anyone with photosensitive epilepsy not to watch this movie. Honestly, no-one should watch this movie, but there is a long sequence in this move where the screen flashes colors rapidly. I'm not even someone who is easily bothered by flashing lights, and that sequence hurt my eyes. Plot - This movie is really boring. Honestly I was hoping that it would be so stupid that it becomes funny (like the first movie) but at no point does it get to that level of ridiculousness. There are several pointless subplots (like the romance) that only seem to be in this movie to waste time. The only scenes that I kind of liked were a few of the scenes with Spider-Man, but even then they were kind of dumb. I'm glad that this franchise ended. Every other version of Spider-Man that I've seen so far is so much better in nearly every way. I know a lot of people didn't like ""Spider-Man 3"" but at least that movie had believable effects and a coherent story.Effects - This movie has pretty terrible effects. Electro never reaches the same level of goofiness as The Lizard, but he's still bad. Unfortunately, all the bad acting, action, and effects in this movie end up just being really dull as opposed to funny. Again, the action is really bad. I'm pretty sure that nearly everything in the fights is CG and it looks really bad. Acting - Like I said, most of the acting is pretty bad. I don't know if its the bad script, the bad direction, or if no-one cared. Probably all three. No-one in this movie gives a convincing performance.Overall this movie is the worst thing that a movie can be - boring. I'll give the first movie credit, it had me laughing. It was at the movie's stupidity, but at least the first movie was creative in how dumb it got. This sequel is just poorly made, cliched crap. Also, and I'm not even making this up, this movie put my little brother to sleep. He was fast asleep on the couch about an hour into it. That is how boring it is."

The film doesn't have a convoluted story. It's very neatly executed and the narration is very easy to follow. This film, in short, is a complete treat for any SPIDER-MAN fan.There's always a lot going on in the film, and the director avoids usage of pointless subplots, which makes each and every sequence integral to the story. There are a lot of touching moments as well. For instance, one brief scene in which Spidey walks along with a young boy is bound to stay with me forever. It made him so lovable and kind that I found it to be one of the best moments in the film. Similarly, the way his web has been shown in slow motion, in one sequence is simply heartwarming.The action is really entertaining. Every action sequence dazzles, and the sprinkling of CGI on it makes it much more fun. The web-slinging sequences have been shot extremely well. The story is very simple and straightforward. Every single performance is remarkable, especially that of Andrew and Emma, while other actors also put up decent acts. The final shot is quite energetic and concludes the film on an epic note. Last but not the least, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is simply an entertaining superhero movie which has loads of entertainment and light hearted fun."
" Happily the last Sony Spider-Man movie
",0.5574,-0.0064,2018-05-30 00:00:00,6,Andrew Garfield put on the Spider-Man suit once again in the second movie of sequel. Emma Stone also appeared in this one with less interesting parts. She came back as his girlfriend at the beginning for braking up in the first minutes of the film and dying at the end. Who do that? There's a non written rule that prohibits to kill a beautiful women in a movie and even more when it's a important character. I was frustrated when I saw it. Once again it's a too important death. Some franchises are not killing enough characters but Sony are making too dark movie.
" Everything wrong with the first film is back, but much worse.
",-0.7351,-0.9933,2018-05-08 00:00:00,3,"There's nothing much to say here. I had no idea I could be disappointed by a movie I wasn't even remotely excited for. I didn't like the first Amazing Spider-Man but it was a average movie as a whole, this movie somehow takes all the problems I had with the first one and either got rid of them and introduced some more, or kept them and somehow made them worse. The acting, unlike the original, is awful. No one is enthusiastic about anything and literally no one gave a damn. Electro looks stupid and his origin is just as stupid and Peter's romance with Gwen is inconsistent and not believable in the slightest. It's not as dark as the original but when it does try to get dark and dramatic they fail on every level. The ending, when Gwen dies and Peter is distraught I did not feel a single bit of emotion because they're relationship was done so badly and the acting never convinced me. I honestly do not get why so many people like and defend this movie as it completely bastardizes the Spider-Man character."

I love Andrew Garfield and all but as Spiderman he lacks any real emotion as being the Spiderman character he is supposed to fill. Spiderman is a teenager still in high school and Garfield looks like a grown 25 year-old man. The motivation and reasoning for the blue electro ""no-one-cares-about-him"" villain portrayed by Jamie Fox is completely abysmally stupid. ""Spiderman doesn't remember me from that one random time I said hi to him and even though I LOOK NOTHING LIKE I DID BEFORE he should remember me"". Shut up. This villain character sucks and is forgettable in every way possible. 
I'm glad Gwen died in this movie honestly. It's a perfect representation of this catastrophe that was ""The 'Amazing' Spider-Man"" franchise. 
Was it enjoyable? 
not really as the SGI for Jamie's character made it look like he had an extra 20 chromosomes and was not believable whatsoever. Even at the age of 13 I didn't understand why electro dude hated Spider-Man so much. It made no sense.
You ruined my favorite superhero and I will hate you forever for it. Waste of money and time, but it is the perfect example of what NOT to do in a movie.

It's unecesarry and stupid, and plagues so many parts of this movie. It looks bad and is only there because the cinematography is so bleedingly atrocious. The beginning has it especially bad, with shaky cam out the wazoo, and it never works.Nothing in this movie looks good. The color correction is horrible and the characters look dumb.The story is incoherent, dumb, and cliche. The villain's plot is stupendously dull, and the tone is bad and inconsistent. The humor never works. All of the shots are so bland and tasteless.This is a forgettable, talentless, boring movie, and it really shows. Do not spend money on this disgusting piece of film."

Heavy technology can't beat the deeper dimensions of human emotions. What was missing is the antagonistic attitude of Harry; poor dealing with electro. Can't the spider-man still be reformative in his approach rather than finishing all the evil doers. The effects and sound do add but little. The entire innocence of spider-man is turned into a witty role that is not much suited.

I was heart broken when Gwen died (unfortunately) in the end. This movie deserves a high rating simply for having the ""guts"" to confront mortality and the reality of even a super hero's ability to save even the ones we love most. Phew...now that the heavy stuff is over I'll make a long story short.

This is another overblown, bloated, and unappealing mess of a movie, with a ridiculously overlong running time at two and a half hours. It just goes on and on and on, through the same old plot scenarios (the Green Goblin AGAIN?) and cheesy romance already witnessed in the Sam Raimi trilogy, and failing to add anything new whatsoever. Okay, so the CGI web-slinging scenes are better, but the film is still light and superficial and doesn't even try to connect on an emotional level. Garfield is stuck playing an immature character and the rest of the cast aren't much better. This film is at its best in the energetic opening and closing sequences, both starring a cameoing Paul Giamatti, and in the scenes involving Jamie Foxx's entertaining villain. The rest is merely mundane, and the 3D effects are completely uninspiring too."
" Adolescent Schmaltz
",0.0,-0.9891,2018-03-14 00:00:00,3,"Maybe I should have expected this movie to be bad. The previous Spiderman movies with Toby Maguire were coated in a syrupy view of life. Virgin youth fighting cartoonish villains in a rich man's landscape. This one is more of the same, just worse. Andrew Garfield portrayed Peter Parker as an impatient, sullen teen laying around his room. Then swinging about in New York with a whole different personality. Emma Stone portrays his girlfriend who graduates high school and in the next scene in a high tech Oscorp corporate job. What? The movie portrays a rich man's landscape where those to be envied are the 1%ers and the battlefield is New York where this week's monster villain sprays bullets at random, but no one is actually killed. Blocks of New York are destroyed but no one is actually killed. No one is shown homeless due to the goings on. Ridiculous. Maybe it is the intended audience they are appealing to, teens and man-children. I can suspend belief and enjoy Sci-fi movies but the landscape has to be just a bit believable. Consequences happen, except in Marvel movies.
Poor Jamie Foxx is one of the villains, unrecognizable under makeup after the transformation. He is cast as a nerd, a nobody. See nerds are still acceptable to make fun of, to be the focus of human meanness. Previously that person would have been a Stepin Fetchit or some ethnic class but that is no longer PC to do but the meanness is still there. The desire to ridicule, the need to have a justification for offensive behavior. It's fun for the audience to make fun of people. You just have to pick the ones no one will object to. So the nerd. Jerry Lewis made a whole career out of it.
Typically the action sequences were filled with CGI that ignores any real physics but are fun to watch. Human interactions are sappy, banal, and adolescent. It would be nice to see a special effects movie peopled by complex adults. I guess the audience isn't there."

",0.3182,-0.5981,2018-02-25 00:00:00,5,"I have to applaud Sony for their ambition, I mean you can literally see that they wanted to create a reinvigorated Spider-Man franchise so badly. It oozes exposition and universe building that it has now become a detriment to the film itself. Peter Parker, having now saved the city once, is entangled in another threatening situation(s) where his number one fan is involved in a freak accident that leaves him with electrifying powers. Having forgot about him, Spider-Man has now made a sworn enemy who simply just wants to be noticed. Whilst this is happening, Harry Osborn takes over his father's company but is battling his own personal hereditary disease in which he needs Spider-Man's blood to save him. Don't forget though, Gwen Stacy wants to move to England for her education so Peter must deal with his one true love and prevent her from leaving. Oh wait there's more! The Rhino is apparently in this wreaking havoc (for all of 2 minutes). Felicity Jones...wait, Felicity Jones is in this? Oh yeah, she is. Aunt May has to work double time which sounds exhausting. A blackout occurs which leaves two planes flying blind, will they collide!? Peter investigates the mysterious disappearance of his father. There's lust for power in Oscorp and to top it all off, Max's teeth get magically straightened when he turns into Electro...yes, I'm done. To say this film is overstuffed would be an understatement. There is far too much happening and hardly any of them interconnect. They are separate plot points where most feel unnecessary. Who even cares if Aunt May works double time? Who is Felicia...wait, Felicity Jones? Really? Oh yes...I see her. Having three villains in one film just doesn't work. Focus on one, or two if necessary...but three is overkill. The action scenes with Electro were pretty, and actually compelling. I applaud the final ten minutes to kill off a certain character, was a damn bold move which paid off. Just unfortunate the rest of the film is a mess."

It's still an under-cooked and over-produced mess, though, one that is most certainly the result of too many cooks (and super-villains) in the kitchen. There are scenes that provide passing entertainment - for example, the spider-swinging sequences are fantastically realised with honestly some of the best visual effects I've seen - but the feature then gets bogged down in exposition and stupidity as a corporate espionage plot comes into play and then promptly fizzles away, leaving us with nothing but the empty promise of sequels which, after this film failed so spectacularly, will now never see the light of day. 5/10"

Which is a shame considering certain things teased at the end of the film but will never happen now.Again Garfield doesn't shine in the titular role, in fact few people do. This sequel is uninspired, hollywood cliche filled and quite frankly boring.The Good:Colm Feore & Dane DeHaanThe Bad:The changes to the villians are far too severePoor soundtrack againThings I Learnt From This Movie:Paul Giamatti should adopt his characters look on the inside so that his appearance is as ugly as his personalityMost superheroes also have the power of recklessly endangering the publicLittle known fact, the Christian god's real name is Sparkles therefore Electro couldn't have called himself that in fear of getting sued"

In the beginning of the movie I thought that Spider-Man was trying really hard to be that sarcastic, funny, wise-guy that Stan Lee realized, many years ago, Spider-Man was supposed to be. Certainly this franchise has come a long way since Toby Maguire's version of Spidey, but it still isn't quite there yet with Andrew Garfield playing the web-slinger.I didn't really get into this movie until it started looking, feeling, and sounding a lot more like a Marvel movie does today. Until that point, I was considering more like a 3 or 4, rather than the 6-stars I eventually gave it.I didn't see this film until 2017, so I think I was perhaps spoiled by the ""new"" Spider-Man and a host of fantastic Marvel movies that followed The Amazing Spider-Man 2's release in 2014.If you're a fan of the ""Marvel Galaxy"" of movies, see this.

Sure, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is not as good as its predecessor from two years ago, but it is still very enjoyable. The film does well linking back to the first film, while also laying some back story for the next one.The storyline starts off quite simple - Peter & Gwen are in still in love, but he's conflicted because of the promise he made to her Dad, so there's a bit of ""will they, won't they?"" But at least we have Garfield & Stone - both just plain better actors than Maguire & Dunst. They introduce Max/Electro (Foxx) quite well, but Harry Osborn (DeHaan) a little less so. And I wish they'd saved the Stan Lee cameo for later on! Still, it's mostly faithful for the comics - with the exception of Giamatti as The Rhino (almost unrecognisable!), although it makes sense he'd be in metal armour, rather than rubber!I feel they went a little too close to the original trilogy by focusing on Osborn/Green Goblin/Oscorp and not enough on Electro as the main villain & Gwen as the love interest. When you see how powerful Electro becomes (I don't recall him being as strong/capable in the comics), it makes you question why/how Spider-Man would actually be fighting him - seems like a job for the Fantastic Four or The Avengers! It's probably a little too long at 2 hours 20min, but still, there's some rousing speeches (thanks Aunt May & Gwen), some very funny moments and plenty of great action.

The movie starts off with Gwen at her graduating ceremony waiting for peter while he is fighting the rhino which shows a separation between peter as himself and as spider man. Through out the movie peter feels regret in dating/seeing Gwen due to her father dying and the promise he makes to him (not seeing Gwen) which eventually leads to Gwen's death. The movie has a great love/relationship story between Peter and Gwen/ Peter and Harry. The movies uses shots like point of view and close up views. Although I liked the movies a lot i didn't like the part that Gwen died which brought a depressed mood to the story which could have been the end of Spider-Man.
" Surprisingly watchable
",0.296,0.986,2017-10-23 00:00:00,6,"A rare case of the sequel being an upgrade on the first installment. This film is a mixed bag. It sometimes suffers from the same disjointed storytelling as its predecessor, and is often corny as hell and therefore predictable. There are too many competing story lines, and they don't entirely add up or resolve themselves. Spiderman is a certified jerk. There are some bits that just don't quite work - how, for instance, a man who consistently demonstrated to be made of pure electricity, and who can disseminate himself at will, can be physically punched and tied up in the final battle is beyond me. But the characters themselves are intriguing, well-cast, compelling, and visually exemplary. The best thing about this film is that it feels quite like a video game - the segmented nature of the plot, the visuals, particularly in the Electrode battles, and the overall tone really take you along for the ride, and it was quite refreshing to have a film like this just having some fun with its content, something which the first installment entirely failed to do. Doing so draws the eye away from the problems, making them, if not less noticeable, then at least less irritating. This is a deeply flawed film, but once it gets into its stride (which, admittedly, takes a while) it is pretty good fun. The ending is surprisingly brave, and is a powerful way to round off the narrative. Also, any film that nicks its final scene from The Incredibles knows what's good for it. Glad I watched it."

If you're going to do Spiderman, you either have to start small, from his beginnings, and dedicate a whole movie to that, or just make a movie assuming he already holds the mantle of superhero and have him solve a big mystery using his brains. More of Spiderman at the computer if nothing else. I know this may remind some of the Spiderman and Friends cartoon, so if you're too cool for that I guess, then, well... So what.This movie did not captivate me or anyone else. Who cares if Andrew Garfield is young. It would be that much more hilarious if he was a well-established superhero in New York City. Then, just when he thinks he has everything figured out, an alien craft is reported over the city. At first the sighting is a joke, but a week later people begin disappearing. Mutilated bodies appear in the streets. A strange creature called Venom is rumored to exist. Spiderman must fight him and then in the end he wins back the black Spidey suit in the most epic thing that has ever happened. Bitchin'."

This movie also had a lot of action and Jamie Fox was great as Electro.But there were a few flaws to the film like Rhino at the end of the movie was a guy in the suit. Harry Osborn as the Green Goblin killed Gwen instead of Norman Osborn even though we saw him at the beginning of the movie which never made sense speaking of the Green Goblin the guy who played Harry in the movie was great as James Franco's successor but he was a miscast as the Green Goblin. But what never made sense was how did Gwen exactly die from falling inside the clock tower when Spiderman caught her in time.I really wish Marc Webb didn't pull the plug on this movie and have The Amazing Spiderman 3 get canceled. If they weren't going to have a Spiderman 4 in the previous films. I hope they don't play this game with Tom Holland as Spiderman in the current films as they did with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield who have both been great Spidermen in these films."

Well, they decided that The Amazing Spiderman 2 was going to be Spiderman: And The Set-Up Of The SpiderVerse Or Something. IT tries and succeeds at SOME good moments here and there, but the whole adds up to an uneven and overstuffed and not wholly satisfying experience.Spiderman is one of the greatest characters to have ever been conceived in comics: and it took til Spiderman: Homecoming to bring the character back to his roots of being a high-schooler trying to juggle superhero life with his personal life and not worry about building a bajillion sequels to a start-up franchise.

I also can't stand how villains are portrayed. Rhino was completely useless, Electro was a joke, and words can't describe how bad Harry is as both himself and as the greed goblin.

",0.7003,0.9261,2017-07-22 00:00:00,3,"After the carbon copy remake of 'Spiderman' (2002) that was 'The Amazing Spiderman' (2012). albeit with Gwen Stacy as the love interest (played beautifully by Emma Stone) rather than Mary-Jane, proved successful it was no surprise to see Andrew Garfield (still too cool for the role) return in this sequel.It's a better film than the one that preceded it, mainly because it's not having to cover the origins of Spiderman, and also it doesn't just feel like a copy of what Sam Rami did in his trilogy of films a decade ago.Emma Stone is the best thing about this film, effortlessly playing what is essentially a thin role, but Jamie Foxx is good as the villain too.Like me, Marvel obviously weren't convinced by this these films. Garfield got the boot, and yet another 'Spiderman' reboot has just been released."
" A decent sequel but a failed franchise starter
",-0.6652,-0.8934,2017-07-09 00:00:00,6,"The sequel to the reboot expands on the backstory of Spider-man's parents and introduces new villains in an unsuccessful attempt to build a Spider-man universe. After a brief prologue about his parents, Spider-man (Andrew Garfield) swings through the city, a lot more comfortable in his role as a hero as he fights the criminal Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti). In the process, he saves the electrician Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx). Late for his own graduations where valedictorian Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) gives a speech, Peter Parker swings in just in time having stopped the criminal from getting away with stolen plutonium. Living at home with Aunt May (Sally Field), Peter struggles to continue to be a hero and keep his identity a secret as the city has mixed feelings about him.Max Dillon is obsessed with Spider-man making up voices for him as he readies for work and imagining scenarios where he worked with him. Gwen Stacy also works at Oscorp whose founder Norman Osborn (Chris Cooper) has died, leaving the corporation to his son Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan). Max stays behind at Oscorp tower to fix a power problem, is shocked, and falls into a tank of water filled with electric eels. Harry takes control of Oscorp assigning Felicia (Felicity Jones) a top role but taking time to socialize with his childhood friend, Peter. As Oscorp tries to cover up his death, Max Dillon awakes as Electro, possessing an out of control electrical ability.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" Decent sequel with mature tone & listless story, but excellent (shocking) final act
",0.7876,0.988,2017-07-08 00:00:00,6,"Released in 2014 and directed by Marc Webb, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" stars Andrew Garfield as the troubled, but likable hero with spider powers who struggles with relationship issues with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and battles Electro (Jamie Foxx), a humble electrical engineer transformed into a living electric generator. Dane DeHaan is also on hand as Harry Osborn, who has a startling transformation of his own. Sally Field plays Aunt May while Felicity Jones appears as Felicia.It's best to watch the first film before this one because some story elements transfer over. It features the same main cast and has the same tone, so if you liked that one you'll probably like this sequel. Thankfully, they fixed Spider-Man's costume, noticeably the mask & eyes. While I like the mature, sometimes reverential tone, the story feels listless, particularly the part revolving around Electro (which is thoroughly changed from the comics). Foxx is fine; I just found the character, as written, uninteresting. Ditto with the other convoluted subplot. DeHaan works better as the second villain (I'm not going to say who, but it's obvious if you know anything about Spider-Man).Thankfully, everything perks up in the final act where the creators do something bold. I didn't think they'd do it and found it almost shocking, although they didn't milk it for it's potential (but they did well enough). Even the Rhino shows up.The movie runs 142 minutes and was shot in New York (The City, Rochester & Long Island) and Los Angeles. WRITERS: Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci & a couple others.GRADE: B- (6.5/10)"
" ""You were my friend and you betrayed me!""
",-0.2714,0.8506,2017-07-07 00:00:00,4,"15 Expected it to be an utter crap & it truly lived up to that prediction. After opening with a pretty good prologue, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a downhill trip from there & follows Peter Parker enjoying his life fighting crime as Spider-Man but having hallucinations of Gwen Stacy's deceased dad whenever he is with her. But soon he has other things to deal with as new villains in town arrive starting with a Spider-Man obsessed fan who after a mishap mutates into Electro. Next comes Harry Osborn who later transforms into Green Goblin & last we have Rhino but the less I talk about this ass-wimp, the better it is.Director Marc Webb tries to do so many things at once in this sequel that the movie as a whole becomes entangled in its own webbing & not a single one of its sub-plots come out as well as one would've liked. The screenplay is dull, camera-work is more focused on 3D experience than contributing to the story, editing leaves so many unnecessary scenes in tact, VFX is where most of its quarter-billion budget seems to have been expended, the entire plot has no sense of direction, characterization is poor & even Hans Zimmer's music fails to deliver this time.The very few things likable about it is the new Spidey costume which now closely resembles the comic books look, the Gwen/Peter chemistry that's on or off throughout the film, Peter/Harry friendship that should've been further explored & the scenes involving Aunt May which feel most authentic on an emotional scale. The recurring cast has done the same job they did in the last film, adding nothing new to talk about in this one. Jamie Foxx hams his way through as Electro, Dane DeHaan has better moments as Harry than Green Goblin & Paul Giamatti's Rhino is far worse than imaginable.And don't be blinded by the false advertisement going on here as Electro plays the main villain, Green Goblin is present only during the final moments but not for too long & Rhino almost doesn't even exist in this film. On an overall scale, the 2nd chapter of this needlessly rebooted franchise delivers another lackluster cinematic experience & proves that the team has learned nothing from the mistakes it made in the last movie. Adding more extravagant elements into its production only to later end up choking on it, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is far less amazing than what it's selling itself as. Do yourself a favour & waste your money on something else"
" Entertaining.
",0.4404,0.9957,2017-06-19 00:00:00,8,"This is the best Spider-Man flick so far, the film score is better than all the others, this score is lively, catchy, dramatic and has electric guitars as well as classical, a very unique score. Great performances, it's a long film, but it never gets boring, the bad guys are much more interesting, the love interest aspect does not have that much focus as opposed to the previous flicks. This one has a great plot, it's fast- paced, you can't tell whether it's great editing or great directing because the entire motion picture is put together perfectly. Overall The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a brilliant colourful cine."
" This movie was too long and disappointing like the last film.
",-0.1779,0.9201,2017-06-16 00:00:00,2,"I hope that new reboot with Tom Holland is better than The Amazing Spider Man films. Jamie Fox did a bad role in this film like why did the writers screw it up like I don't get that. Most scene are pointless, the Rinho is bareling in this film, and the Green Goblin look terrible in this film like he look like he did drugs and stuff like that."
" One of the worst marvel movies
",-0.3182,-0.9958,2017-04-22 00:00:00,7,"This has to be one of the worst modern superhero movies I have ever seen, possibly also one of the worst. This film has a lot of flaws so bad, so filled with it, it would take a lot of time to analyze it. THE PLOT: The story is a jumbled mess. There is no sense of focus to the film. It tries to answer what happens to Peter's parents, but later on it tries to add mystery when Peter finds the video about his father. Like, why? You already answered the question, why put this in? It just has no sense of pacing. And then there is Electro's sub plot which is forced, poorly fleshed out backstory with the most generic choices a film maker can think off in a superhero movie. This is a bottom of the barrel type of villain, even worse than terrible villains like Lex Luthor from bvs or the joker from suicide squad. On top of that, you also have Harry's sub plot, which is also phoned in, it is just there to add more torture. They try to make him this sympathetic and lost person who loses his family and friends, but here is the problem: THEY BARELY SHOW STUFF LIKE THAT. He barely has any chemistry with the rest of the characters, so why should we care about his arc? THE WRITING: This is one of the worst, poorly written blockbuster movies I have seen. Just like suicide squad, they use cookie cutter dialogue. In the first scene with his parents, the dialogue is really clichÃ©d. They don't talk like real people. Here is some of the dialogue in the plane scene with Peter's parents: Mary Parker: ""Did you see his face? He's never gonna understand"" Richard Parker: ""Mary, we've been through this. Our life, as we know it, is over. We're gonna spend every day from now on looking over our shoulders and never feeling safe. We can't do that to him. "" Why should we even care about this if you don't even build up these characters? Aren't they supposed to be crucial to the plot? Why even bother to put them if there is no care? I also need to point out that the humor here is terrible, like really terrible. I can point out my finger at the scene where Spider-Man strips the Rhino's pants and stop there, but I'm not gonna stop there. I've noticed that many of the dialogue is repeated a second time for some reason. I don't understand why. Did the director think it will add ""drama""? Because it doesn't. It's just annoying. THE DIRECTING: Okay so this is actually a mixed bag. Some of the directing is nice, like the scene where Spider-Man swings in the first 10 minutes, or the scene of his room shot upside down. But sadly, there is unneeded shaky cam. In the first ten minutes, when the ""bad guy"" tries to hijack the plane, there is pointless shaky cam to the point where it's hard to follow it. The choice for musical score is also very lazy. These are scores you find on YouTube for crying out loud. The only decent use of directing is the slow motion which does give some insight of details that matter, like when Spider-Man goes out of his webs in the scene he meets electro for the first time, but still there is poor direction. THE CHARACTERS: I hear this a lot, Andrew Garfield is the best Spider-Man for some reason because he tells jokes or because he is more confident. But here is the problem. Peter started as a geek. From the first reboot, Peter is already a much more confident person. He doesn't need to be bullied or be seen as a nerd. Some of the choices he makes are also alienating. Like for example, he promises Gwen's father to not harm her, but he doesn't attend her funeral to support her loss. It really also doesn't help when Andrew Garfield gives a poor performance. Even when he does gives the quips, it just comes off as cocky, irresponsible and childish. Gwen Stacy is the only decent character in this entire franchise. She is supportive, she is decently acted by Emma Stone, she is smart and uses her brains to help Peter, she is the one who actually shows more emotion and makes this ""love story"" more believable. But sadly, they just don't give enough focus, because the film is a mess. So, when the time comes for her to die, where you should be invested, it seems be a generic death scene for comic fans to recognize. Electro: This is also one of the worst villains in a comic book movie. He starts off as this generic Edward Nigma rip off (Yeah for some reason, this sounds like a good backstory) who forcefully becomes Spider-Man because he saved his life, but then he turns on him because he thought he set him up, even though Spider-Man offered him help, so it just comes as contradicting and a continuity error, and becomes a forgettable, generic villain. I know a lot of people love this movie and I respect that, but I personally just can't love it. In fact, I despise it. ï»¿"
" A huge mess of Sony products and bad dialogue
",-0.5719,0.9969,2017-03-17 00:00:00,1,"Marvel has been on a tear lately, making great film after great film it seems like they can do no wrong. Believe it or not Marvel wasn't always this perfect. Back in the 80s and 70s, but in the year 2014, we expected great things from Amazing Spider Man. Surprisingly it was in fact amazingly shitty. This movie is almost everything I didn't want in a spider man movie and makes this awful sequel for the web shooter. This movie takes place after the events of the previous film where Peter Parker is on top of the world. He has everything going for him and then he meets Harry Osborn and Jamie Foxx is introduced as the villain ""electro"" and Parker's life turns to s**t. I'll start off by talking about the good. Andrew Garfield is a great spider man, he portrays the character really well. That's the only good I have to say about this film. This review may just seem like I am hating on an average film, when in reality I am making a good case to not see this piece of s**t. I think Emma Stone is great actress, one of the best working today, but in this film I just- just don't know what she's doing. The relationship between her and Peter Parker is so poorly written it's incredible to see that from this kind of movie. At one point Emma Stone says in the film ""I'd break up with Peter,"" What does that even f*****g mean. Dan Dehaan is a great actor as well, but he was absolutely awful as Harry Osborne. He so mundane and so mad all the time, he was more like a cartoon character. This movie is a huge mess. All the events in the film don't flow together at all, While the screenplay itself is s**t, the story just bugged me. It seemed like they took the most generic Spider Man story possible and put it into this film. I wasn't interested at all what was happening to Peter and Gwen mainly because it came straight out of the comics. Now that isn't a problem for everyone, but you see everything from a mile away, it's so predictable. Now believe it or not their are more problems with this movie. Number one the action scenes almost felt unnecessary, which is a big problem to have in a Superhero movie. It seemed like during action scene I thought to myself ""hm they could just talk it out"" TALK IT OUT! That is the last thing I want to think during a movie like this. I want the action to make the movie have weight and significance, but it didn't work in this film. The action scenes felt more like they were there because the script said so and not because it made sense. Even some of the worst action movies make the action scenes matter in a way. The special effects are good though, what I expected, but as we all know special effects can't make a great movie cough ""Titanic"" cough. The most glaring problem with this movie was the villains. Like Spider-Man 3 there is too many villains that the movie wants to spend time developing. One of villains in the trailer was barely in the movie, He was heavily advertised and everything, what the f**k. Overall The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a huge piece of s**t and I don't recommend seeing it. Spider-Man Homecoming looks awesome, so here's hoping this movie will be forgotten soon."
" The fact that this movie came out the way it did is ratter astounding

I have enjoyed every Spider-Man film up until this one, and yes that does include The Amazing Spider-Man 1. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a poorly acted, convenience driven, incoherent mess of a film. Nothing in the plot makes any sense whatsoever, and let me get this out of the way now the soundtrack may be the worst one in decades.3/10 Garbage"
" Missed the mark by miles
",-0.296,-0.9711,2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"I don't even know where to begin.This film fails on almost every level. The pacing is all over the place, the character arcs are underdeveloped, the story is incredibly inconsistent, and this movie clearly just exists to sell advertising.There are constant subplots that could have just as easily become self-contained movies, but nope! Sony crams everything in because they need to sell merchandise! And if that wasn't enough, the in-your-face product placement will certainly discourage you faster. Every TV and computer shown are Sony branded. No thought or care was put into making this film.Let's see: three villains, criminally underused in the film, and even when they are used, the narrative and dialogue are just disastrous. Also, Peter Parker's on-off relationship with Gwen Stacy takes up way too much of the running time. They try to give us closure as to what happens to Peter's parents, but the only problem is that nobody cares.Jamie Foxx plays Max Dillon, an Oscorp engineer, who might as well have a neon sign over him saying ""NERD"" because all the clichÃ©d stereotypes are overblown here. He has no friends, nobody pays attention to him apart from Peter and Gwen. He forms an obsession of Spiderman because he got saved once by him. He gets electrocuted by electric eels after falling into the most precariously placed tank ever and becomes Electro, whose change of heart about Spiderman is so quick, blink and you'll miss it.Dane DeHaan plays Harry Osborn, Peter's 'childhood friend'? The way this is written is done so poorly. They haven't met in ten years and automatically they're best friends? At least Sam Raimi's series was consistent. Basically, Harry is dying from a hereditary disease that killed his father Norman. For no adequately explained reason, he is dying at a more accelerated rate and is desperate for the healing factor in Spiderman's blood. Thanks to the 'logic' of Peter taking a picture of Spiderman meaning Peter knows Spiderman, Harry pressures Peter into trying to bring Spiderman to him. The motivations and character driven plots are executed so badly.Paul Giamatti plays the Rhino for about five minutes of the overall running time and the worst thing is, we have no idea what the actual conclusion of that fight was! There is no natural flow to this movie at all. It only exists because Sony wanted to build an expanded Cinematic Universe and they kept alluding to the Sinister Six. How arrogant do you need to be to think, ""Oh yeah, we don't have to put effort into this film because we're guaranteed a sequel either way!"" Just as well there's no follow-up because, to be honest, where do you go from here?! Andrew Garfield is way too handsome and charismatic as Peter Parker. He's just a hipster, and kind of an ass, to be honest. In the opening scene, he prioritises his wise-cracks over the lives of civilians.I'm just gonna stop because this brings back Vietnam flashbacks every time. We're depending on you, Tom Holland. That's all I'm saying."
