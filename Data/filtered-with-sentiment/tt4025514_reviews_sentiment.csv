" Subarra, it could be a good film
",0.4404,-0.1405,2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,"The story itself might be good, but pale scenes containing corrupt politicians and their conspiracy to the Mafia, cheap drug 'n' sex, well, I don't need such bad interpretations, because they are probably the truth...
But the most annoying was the poor music score, old-fashioned keyboard sounds without any kick. No this is a really bad movie!"
" Very good.
",0.4927,0.7351,2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"If you're a fan of Gomorrah, 4-Blocks, Narcos, and other similar stories of organised crime, then this is for you. Based in Rome, rather than the more usual South, this is an excellent depiction of a mafia land deal, overlaid with the real events around the resignation of Berlusconi. The acting and story isn't quite to the standard of Gomorrah (which I rate 10-10) but it is not far off. An excellent movie."
" A storyline you can follow
",0.0,0.8636,2020-12-29 00:00:00,7,This is an Italian film featuring corrupt politicians and the Mafia. Unlike some the storyline is easy to follow and it all comes together quite nicely. Well worth a watch.
" Pleasantly surprised. Make sure you get to see this one.
",0.743,0.932,2020-10-20 00:00:00,8,"If you like great acting, timing, poise, delivery with tense standoffs blending it all together, watch Suburra. A whole bunch of wicked and nasty characters all seeking to outdo eachother - or kill eachother, either for control, bloodlust or just to cover their own tracks. Suburra has it all. Corrupt politicians. Old school mafiosa, new gen crims and dodgy ""business"" deals. Stir in some hookers, junkies and wannabes and you've got a delicious callous mix of fight-to-the-last man - or woman, intensity.This is a gritty film. It's a gritty eight out of ten and I'd almost relent and give it the nine. I think you'll be happily surprised. It's an actors film. And amazingly everyone in this pulls it off to perfection. I certainly cannot fault the cast performances one iota. I loved this because it has some genuine European authenticity about how the tale is told and the way in which corruption unwinds. Not just some Hollywood flash in the pan with big-budget effects thrown in for good measure.Ya. Eight outta ten from me. Now go watch it."

" A violent film with great visual style about delinquents , corrrupt politicians and Italian Mafia
",0.0516,0.8837,2020-05-19 00:00:00,7,"In 2011 , Ostia , the port of the Ancient Rome is the main issue of an important project of construction to become it into a new Las Vegas and whose great promoter is a mobster called Samurai (Claudio Amendola) . While a politician (Pierfrancesco Favino) provides the change legislation where necessary . But the politician gets caught in a dangerous and compromising situation when he is with a prostitute (Greta Scarano) and things go awry .Then ambition , blackmail, vendetta , kidnapping and decay reach everything and everybody .Rome will fall while corruption is infecting the city .Thrilling film with a lot of violence and murders in which a real project that participate various dark social stratum with the purport to make the Ostia harbour in Las Vegas-alike goes wrong. A heavy-going story has a moving and politically incorrect writing and especially dealing with corruption interwoven between Parlamentary members and Mafia . The picture contains thrills , violence , nudism , strong sexual scenes , disturbing subjects , suspenseful , being pretty entertaining , though sometimes resulting to be hard to follow . While this picture is certainly not the most pleasant thing to watch , it does provide a daring insight into the corrupt world of politicians on the take and a mafia-controlled system which is brooding and frank . This exciting and thought-provoking film displays a good cast who gives nice performances , such as Pierfrancesco Favano , Claudio Amendola , Greta Scarano, Borghi , Germano , and Jean Hughes Anglade as a Cardinal.It packs an enjoyable musical score by Pasquale Catalano in New Age style and wonderful , sensitive songs . As well as luxurious and colorful cinematography by Paolo Carnera .This intense and intriguing film was well directed by Stefano Sollima who delivers an unflinching filmmaking resulting in one which fans of the Mafia/thriller genre will no want to miss . Sollima is a director and writer especially known for Sicario 2018 , Gomorra the series , Crimini , La esquadra , Rome Criminal, Zerzerzeo and A.C.A.B. Essential and indispensable watching , this highly recommended film is the same as the Italian Mafia film or Poliziesco of the 70s."
" Never boring mafia thriller
",0.1695,0.7043,2020-04-11 00:00:00,7,The running time ran very quickly away. A sign that this thriller was never boring. Good actors with a well packed intriguing story between politics and the Vatican. Very interesting mix with all needed ingredients to get a real bloody mafia movie under the local clans. The soundtrack was top. You can watch it even you have already seen the mini Netflix seasons of Suburra. I can highly recommend both of them. 7/10.
" Italian Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9603,2020-04-10 00:00:00,9,"I am a big fan of Narco-drug series, and this one is probably one of the best I've watched in the past.
AMAZING. It's brutal, realistic and pretty well done. To add, if you love Gomorrah or Romazzo Criminale, this one is for you. A truly gem's genre."
" What a load of g@rbage
",0.0,0.6808,2020-04-08 00:00:00,2,This film I don't know but i thought it was pretty naf to be honest I could not watch it went from the pope and Vatican city to gangsters and back to Vatican city then a threesome at some guys house and then Vatican city had to stop watching as was confusing
" Loved it
",0.5994,0.9349,2020-03-31 00:00:00,9,Brilliant I loved it as a massive fan of the whole crime/gangster genre this as far as I am concerned is up there with the best .now going to watch the TV series
" A Real Bad Story
",-0.5423,-0.8201,2020-03-10 00:00:00,8,"It looks pretty realistic how the story goes in this mafia story. It's disgusting and frightening how the story goes, but it feels also realistic in a bad way. The dirt, the intrigues, the milieu, the politics. The death of people in this movie looks realistic. If 'The Godfather' would be remade these days, I guess it would look like this movie. It might look sober in some scenes. But I guess even this is realistic. A recommendation for people who like mafia movie that feel realistic."
" Quite average film of revenge
",-0.5267,0.7809,2020-01-18 00:00:00,5,"During these few decades Italian film industry has been producing films for the local market and it shows. Of course ask any italian and they'll tell you that in italy the state, catholic church and mafia are the same thing.I felt like an outsider during the two hours. All the characters were dislikeable caricatyres of anti-heroes.What comes to a brief and funny sex scene, the director appears to underline that this is not a romantic affair and in that sense the raw material gets justification.One could also argue that bad taste is taste like any other taste, however this film was obviously made for young men. Some other director could have made a far better film with the same material, focusing on the characters.It's just mediocre at the best."
" La Squallido Vita!
",0.0,0.9861,2019-12-11 00:00:00,8,"Stefano Sollima's Suburra is a fine addition to the ranks of Italian neo-noir mafia crime films. It tells an intriguing tale of interrelated stories all semi-connected to a corruptly-sought land development in the seaside Roman suburb of Ostia, over a number of days in November 2011. Though specific dates designate the various chapters of the movie and the events depicted are supposed to be inspired by true occurrences, this is one film that many would hope to be largely fictional, as the forces of the established good, have virtually no part in the proceedings we see played out.Politicians and various gangster families and groups vie for a piece of the real estate deal, that is to be shadily financed through the back rooms of the Vatican, after a controversial zoning law is passed by a Coalition government coming to the end of its effective administrative and electoral life. Given what we know about modern Italian political history, this is a quite realistic scenario, though I'm really not sure of the significance of the planned resignation of the Pope, we see identified in the early stages of Suburra. This is the one narrative thread never really followed up. (Pope Benedict did retire/resign in 2013 of his own volition.)The acting throughout by the whole cast is universally good with special mention to be made of the frighteningly good Adamo Dionisi as Manfredi Anacleti, the patriarch of the anarchistic gypsy Anacleti family. I was also engrossed with the enigmatic Samurai, a ""mature"" senior Mafia strongman with a legendary reputation, who appeared to be the most principled of the vast array of participants. He was intent on seeing the deal facilitated smoothly , whilst seeking to keep any likely disruptions minimised.There are some half dozen mini-stories playing out across the broad canvas which leads to the climactic November day cryptically identified from early on in the movie as The Apocalypse. In the telling of the stories there are plenty of surprises, shocks, betrayals and towards the end, a couple of pleasing twists. Throughout all, Sollima directs with an assured hand, ensuring the very comprehensive chains of events are still followed to a logical end relatively easily. The production values of the film are of a high quality and his handling of a couple of big set pieces, such as an out of control shopping mall shoot out and a high speed rush through narrow Roman streets, is extremely professionally thorough.Though the good guys, like the police, are virtually invisible in Suburra, they don't end up being really missed. The eventual outcomes though frequently bloody, provide a satisfying conclusion to the story. I'm not surprised that Netflix, on the basis of this film, decided to make a prequel TV series, as you do wonder, whilst watching, about the earlier lives of characters like Samurai."
" Edgy dark thriller stumbles at the last
",0.1027,-0.4404,2019-12-11 00:00:00,6,"As with many great productions, there can be superlative writing, acting, score, cinematography, pace, tension and drama all working together to immerse a viewer in a visceral, emotive story such as 'Suburra'.However, for some frustrating reason an unlikely deus ex machina is thrust into this plot at the final sequence-making one feel as if one has just entered a different film - a b-grade revenge action thriller.The previous film up until the last five-ten minutes superb, it's strength lying in a sense that one is peeking beyond the veil of everyday pretence to a dark yet familiar underbelly.Yet again cheap 3 act by-the-numbers themes of resolution, revenge by an ridiculous character ( possibly to please bloodthirsty feminists ), ending up cheapening and spoiling the whole piece.
I'm glad not every director panders to frivolous political signaling because it's starting to ruin good stories.
Go and watch the new ghostbusters or other trite."
" Definitely Worth A Watch
",0.5574,-0.088,2019-11-07 00:00:00,8,"I went into this film not really knowing what I was going to see. I'd acquired it because I read somewhere that it was pretty violent. It is, but not so much that it overwhelms the movie. In fact, if anything, the one all-encompassing overwhelming element on display is the acting of all those involved. They were all top notch. The cinematography and splendid pictures of Rome were to die for. Makes me want to break out my debit card and head over to the airport!"
" Hard hitting and brilliantly filmed
",0.5574,0.9493,2019-09-24 00:00:00,10,"If you loved Gomorrah, either movie (2008) or TV series (2014), then Suburra does for Rome what Gomorrah did for Naples. Perfectly cast with an array of characters no one could love, an aspect that was oddly compelling - no heroes - and testament to what a great film achievement it is, the story builds drama by amazing degrees through both the shifting storyline as well as the graphic cinematography using good cameras. The production values were high, with much of the action, and artistic flair, set during a thunderstorm. The locations were brilliant, with some great use of lights, and often involved huge crowds, adding immeasurably to authenticity. Loved the gangster outfits. The acts of violence were sharp and intensely shocking indeed, and often came out of the blue. I nearly docked it a point for a sub-plot that seemed to have no point, but other than that this is the most thrilling Italian crime drama I'm yet to see."
" Good film,but not as brilliant,as reviews say...
",0.4404,0.8998,2019-08-22 00:00:00,6,"Good film,but not as brilliant,as reviews say...
Very good cinematography,superb acting,good story.But,personally for me,It's too over stylized ,it doesn't have the same,if I may say.charm of more traditional mafia films...Basically ,here I couldn't be emotionally involved with any of the characters,most of them kind of one-dimensional.Anyhow,definitely a very good one time watch and,also definitely will not be added to my personal collection."
" Not sharing the enthusiasm of other reviewers
",-0.5773,-0.8811,2019-06-19 00:00:00,6,"Suburra has a very decent production values, including plot, cast, camera work and colors. It has the necessary raw, brutal approach to the subject matter, depicting the characters as they probably would be in real life.The main drawback, for me, was on the storytelling side. The transition between the scenes wasn't smooth, raising multiple questions to fill the gap. For example, how did viola find Samurai so easily? And how was Ostia's gang so unprotected for Samurai so easily to invade it?Another flow was character underdevelopment (for most characters at least). The problem arises from lack of small talk conversation that not necessarily advance the plot, but rather shows who they really are.Not a bad one, but I wouldn't recommend it as a must see either."
" Congratulations to the creators
",0.5994,0.8271,2019-05-14 00:00:00,7,"Great film love it from the first minute This is a rare good movie about dark side of Italy this movie just made top ten in my list masterpiece. Unfortunately this movie is based on one of the worst scandal of Rome, ""Mafia capitale"""
" One of the the best crime movies of 2010's
",0.1779,-0.762,2019-05-03 00:00:00,9,"Sollima has great style and he doesn't pull back punches. The villains in this movie are guite memorable, especially the brutal gipsy king with his depraved clan. The photography is solid and action scenes are fresh. The shootout in the shopping mall is memorable. Overall a very recommendable crime movie, though not for the faint of the heart. The sex scene can be a bit too much for American tastes."
" Absolutely brilliant !!
",0.6885,0.7906,2018-12-16 00:00:00,8,"A blockbuster of a film up there with the greats in gangster and organised crime thrillers like the Godfather series. Just watched it for the second time and it's a riveting story brilliantly scripted, acted and directed.A must see and you won't look away for a second."
" Living in the (Italian) gangster's paradise.
",0.6369,0.9701,2018-09-20 00:00:00,9,"Wow! This was a superb sample of high-quality crime movie making. ''Suburra'' is an excellent Italian production with a storyline which involves politicians, the clash between the mafia and gypsies clans and the Vatican as well as young thugs, hookers and junkies. The centre of the plot is the building of a series of casino hotels in Ostia a suburb in Rome. The bill has to be approved by the Italian parliament which is not oblivious to external influences such as the mafia or rich businessmen. The notion of corruption is omnipresent throughout the movie, leading to crucial questions regarding the Italian political life. The first forty-five minutes of the movie is a bit confusing as the viewers introduced to a multitude of characters with no obvious connection between them. The story covers a time span of one week, in the form of a countdown to the day of the ''Apocalypse'' which is also the finale of the film. The plot is even-paced reaching a bloody, nevertheless redeeming, finale with a high body count. The performances from all the actors in a movie that has no central character are top-notch while the direction by Stefano Sollima offers many moments of true artistic beauty in the beautiful Roman setting. It should be also noted that ''Suburra'' has a captivating soundtrack which suits the atmosphere of the film and that a tv series under the same title began in 2017. European crime fiction seems to be alive and kicking! Highly Recommended."
" Excellent view of organized crime
",0.0516,0.9631,2018-08-02 00:00:00,9,"This is an outstanding achievement. While many European productions basically look like made-for-tv films, this is cinematic in the best way. 
Still, you have to be patient to be rewarded. Much like Soderbergh's ""Traffic"", the movie features several protagonists and sub-plots that, in the end, all come together. The violence is all there, but not in a show-off action movie style, it is really closely connected to plot and characters. I have not seen a contemporary movie that shows you so much about the power of organized crime. Throughout the movie, police is nonexistent. The crime is not just restricted to gangsters, politicians are part of the system, even the Vatican (just some hints of it).
The actors are great, for non-Italians some are real discoveries. Production values first rate, music, locations all combine to create something really special.
I watched the movie in its dubbed German version because my Italian is just shaky, but it was still great!"
" A sad indictment of the world by compelling watch
",-0.296,0.7809,2018-04-27 00:00:00,7,Get over the subtitles and it's a good movie! Nothing we haven't seen before but played out in a believable gritty way. No spoilers from me. Enjoy the slow burn start as characters are introduced and keep a count of who is left at the end.
" Complicate movie
",0.0,0.7269,2017-10-27 00:00:00,10,My son has been told by his friend about the movie Suburra. Me and my son watching it. It's so complicating for me till Episode 4 I got it to understand the show. We have 4 more episodes to go then wait till next year. Keep up good work. This is my first watching Italian show on Netflix.
" Dark on dark
",0.0,0.2725,2017-10-06 00:00:00,6,Every action has consequences. Unintended or otherwise. Just when you don't think it can get any darker someone goes over the edge and commits an act that at first looks like the end of a story. Of course most of the time those acts are just links in a chain of never ending violence and far reaching consequences. The main feeling you get while watching this film is one of being being sucked down by a giant whirlpool of corruption and crime. There is so much rain it looks like a monsoon. That it (the story) ends in a waterlogged courtyard is fitting. For some reason most of the outside scenes of Rome take place in rain at night. Whether that is a metaphor or not it fits the tone. Dark on dark - but then again maybe the water will wash everything away.
" There's beauty in misery.
",0.0258,0.989,2017-09-10 00:00:00,9,"My 2nd Italian film, my 2nd hit. Gomorra type level (movie and TV show) and hope the new show on Netflix with the same name be at the same level. Well, where I'm start . . . these movie was so good that even the sex scenes between Sabrina and Filippo worth the time. And I'm not a fan of pointless sex and nudity on movies, but even that type of scenes where beautifully filmed in Suburra. I don't know if it's a combination between the dramatic music, the facial expressions of both of them, the surreal beauty of the Italian cities, the beautiful way the movie was filmed or even the great style the italians have to personify people that work on the underworld and corruption. If you're a fan of mob-style crime dramas, I truly recommend these movie and if you don't know yet the Gomorra TV show, give it a look (my favorite TV show produced out of Hollywood) and better than a lot of overrated American TV-shows.PD: That bed conversation scene between Sebastiano and Sabrina was so sad and lovely at the same time."
" Crime in the City
",-0.5423,0.6124,2017-07-25 00:00:00,9,"You know this is structured in the best sense, a familiar sense for people who have seen a couple of crime movies. You know a little bit of how they are structured, you can feel where it is going. And still the suspense is there. Even when you are like ""I see, I know"", it still delivers the punch with such precision that you don't mind a bit of predictability. Also the quality is of the highest standard.Acting wise and story/script wise that is. We are talking about a very tight story about many characters, connected one way or another. If you judge this morally you may have some issues. It'll be hard to find a likable character in this. But that is not what this movie is about. Since this somehow connected to the people who did Gomorra, the show and I reckon the movie, I'm looking forward to watch that too"
" Gritty, tense gangster drama
",-0.34,0.4033,2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"A gangster known as Samurai is putting together a deal to construct a Las Vegas-style casino complex in the harbour area of Rome. He has all the pieces put together - the land (through leaning on the former landowners), the funding (from wealthy mafia families), a politician to help the project get through red tape and change legislation where necessary, and peace within the different mafia families to enable the deal to go through smoothly. Then the politician gets caught in a compromising, potentially career-ending situation and things start to unravel. Samurai has to use all his contacts, negotiation and persuasion skills to keep things on track.Gritty drama. Initially the plot feels quite unfocused, with several sub-plots operating seemingly in parallel. Over time everything comes together, making for a tense and intriguing film.Great final few scenes, as loose ends are tied up and issues resolved, sometimes in unexpected ways."
" overwhelming
",0.0,0.8625,2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"A sprawl of beautifully cast characters and their many intersections. Handsomely crafted, redolent of the types of crime thrillers they don't make anymore, though a little bit too glossy. In keeping up with the crotch-grabbing (sometimes literally) masculine milieu that Sollima – working from a novel and screenplay by Italian journalist Carlo Bonino and writer Giancarlo De Cataldo – seeks to depict, the sexual politics are prehistoric. The women, invariably, are wives, high-heeled secretaries, prostitutes, and molls. Their male equivalents are cardinals, big-wigs and bigger deals. Overall a great story superbly acted."
" New angle on old story: superb direction, acting, photography and dialogue
",0.6249,-0.9195,2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"Italy has made some of the best movies and TV series on the Mafia. Stefano Sollima had previously directed GOMORRA, but I find SUBURRA better in terms of acting, photography, direction, and action sequences. The story unfolds against a time frame of seven days to ""Apocalypse"" - which, I assume, will be an all-out war among the various underworlds in Rome. It offers the usual menu of gloriously beautiful women having sex with corrupt politicians; underhand interests; treacherous souls; unscrupulous blackmailers; overbearing murderers; drug addicts and underdogs... and also an insight into the corrupt and corrupting power of the Catholic Church.I found viscerally scary the character of Manfredi Anacleti (played by Adamo Dionisi), a larger than life gypsy clan leader who lives by blackmail, usury, and murder as he plays rough with his children and treats the world with contempt, respecting only courage - to that end, he keeps poking and provoking an American Pit Bull Terrier canine that provides a truly terrifying sequence at the end.However, the single sequence that will forever stay with me involves pimp Seba (Elia Germano) who gets calls from his father but is too selfish to realize that he needs help. However, his father is already beyond help - in a film pervaded by a perverse and perverted sense of religion, this is the classic biblical case of the father's sins being visited on the son.Seba's father owes millions to Manfredi. The father commits suicide and within a couple of hours Manfredi's men have tracked Seba down and he has to turn over all his property to make up for his father's debts - which he wasn't even aware of.As a pimp, Seba is a tolerable young man, but as his tribulations increase and he loses his ill-begotten wealth, he becomes more complex as a cowardly snitch and, ultimately, a murderer. The irony is that he is one of only two ""winners"" in the end.There are a few other brutal interactions among characters that you hope never to meet in your life. In between all the sordid souls and motivations, there is, however, love.There is love for the corrupt MP's son who gets kidnapped (and that is all you get to know about him, one suspects there'll be no way back for him) and there's love in the ruins of this criminal microcosm. It does not matter that that love emanates from drug users, it still grows like a flower in asphalt, and it provides a solitary ray of hope. Ultimately and unexpectedly, the minnows have a say and you come away feeling that it is a great thing you were not born, and do not live, in the slums - or, for that matter, in the posh suburbs - of Rome.Sollima's direction is superb, the acting is first class across the board, photography is memorably and pungently beautiful - it contrasts with the very evil of life and ugliness of human greed - and the action sequences breath-taking in their authenticity, which is also present in a script backed by raw dialogue.Strongly recommended. 9/10"
" Mob reality
",0.0,0.2665,2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I never watched a lot of Italian movies but this one I will certainly watch again in the future. If you like crime stories then Subbura is for you. It has everything you can ask for. Corrupt politicians, different mafia families, bloody violent scenes, drugs and sex, religious scumbags, scandals and so on. The actors are all excellent and play their roles with much conviction. If you didn't knew they were actors you would really believe they are all mob related. The darkness drips of this movie. One of the better Italian film noir I've seen in a long time. If Stefano Sollima is planning on making more of those movies I'm going to be a fan. It's a long movie but with all the twists, violent scenes and great discussions you will never get bored."
