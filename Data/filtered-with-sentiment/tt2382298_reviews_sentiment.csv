" Intimate, unflinching portrait of the influential film critic
",0.2023,0.2105,2021-02-09 00:00:00,7,"I count myself as a lifelong (well, ever since I discovered him, anyway) fan of Roger Ebert; his reviews, along with those of Leonard Maltin and Pauline Kael, shaped about 90% of my concept of what film criticism should be: above all else, something that a) tells you enough to judge if you're gonna like a movie regardless of whether the author of the review likes it or not, and b) something that is worth reading (and re-reading) for itself, for its own value as a piece of writing, no matter if you agree with it or not. This documentary has many choice moments (like filmmaker Errol Morris suggesting that he probably wouldn't have a career if Siskel and Ebert hadn't promoted his early effort, ""Gates Of Heaven"", against all odds), but I felt the quantity of focus on Ebert's health condition, although Ebert himself demanded it, bordered on the uncomfortably voyeuristic at times. It's a sad yet still hopeful movie, because, after all, Ebert will live forever: with his thousands of reviews covering several decades of film production, plus his ""Great Movies"" retrospectives and other tributes, there will always be something new by him to be discovered, studied and argued for or against. As he himself said, he is still seeing us all at the movies. *** out of 4."
" RIP. Roger
",0.0,0.8956,2020-12-20 00:00:00,7,Love watching Sieskel and Ebert as a kid. Good documentary and held my interest. I do agree with another reviewer that too much of degenerative condition was shown... and has left a lasting impression that is not pleasant.
" Could have been better
",0.4404,0.8973,2020-10-11 00:00:00,6,"It was interesting to a point because I didn't know that much about his history and his partnership.I thought that it dwelled too much on his final days. While this is obviously relevant it would have made a better documentary if it was included in the last five minutes. Also, while trying not to trivialise it, someone dying of cancer has been done before and could maybe be a separate documentary altogether. I wanted more of his wit, insights and pros. He won the Pulitzer after all. What actually made him great in the first place. Not what killed him. I looked at some of the deleted scenes on the dvd. Some were of his political comments and things he'd said in the past which I found more revealing than watching him have his throat sucked out...twice!"
" Deeply moving documentary
",0.0,0.8841,2020-07-28 00:00:00,9,"This is a very emotional and heartbreaking documentary.I always loved Roger and his reviews. I consider him one of the greatest critics of all time. He introduced me to a new world of films, films that about art, not only having fun and that's it. Films that left you wondering, thinking about them. And if it wasn't for him, I'd never known them. I inherited so many things from him, he helped me to understand cinema, to expand my knowledge of it. And, lastly, to devoted myself to this exquisite form of art. Rest in peace, Roger, you'll always be remembered."
" it could have had a different pace, but it's an emotional and passionate work of cinema.
",0.7579,0.9991,2020-05-25 00:00:00,8,"This is about a man and his passion, and about someone that tries to be honest with himself. It's a great documentary about love for cinema, enthusiasm but above all your heart put in something you love. Plus it can be very emotional too, and it mexes very well with the biopic by itself and the intense moments where we see ebert not being able to speak.and actually those moments where we see the man and his huges physical fragilities were for me the most engaging and endearing part of the film. I think they capture beautifully the love ebert still had in those days: and how he was not willing to give up on his passion until he could. The movie also shows very well how his wife was important for him not to let go. For me this was the biggest challenge of this film: how to show this man during this recent period? The movie accomplished that totally.The information about his own life and career might have some ups and downs: we culd have known a bit more of his work, but let's face it: a documentary doesn't need to have the huge amount of footage this movie had, displayed into the screen - it needs to be able to cut until only the right moments appear: so his relation with siskel was well made, his enthusiasm about film festivals and hanging out with friends. would i love to see more of scorsese or other guys? Sure. But i think that wasn't totally the point this movie wanted to make.For me this is a love letter to films and to the dedication of a man that loved his work and had a cool sense of humor even in times of despair. I think is a great movie that definitely should be seen pretty much by anyone. I hope this can get a bigger following that it has, because it definitely deserves. It's emotional its powerful, it's funny and it's about love."
" Marvelous Documentary
",0.5994,0.971,2020-04-07 00:00:00,9,I was a big Richard Ebert fan and always loved his reviews. This documentary is just wonderful. It's about Ebert but also about so much more which is for me a mark of a great film - something that works on a number of levels. The filmmaker Steve James is a master (if you'e not seen his film Hoop Dreams you must). James takes us on a beautiful journey - bravo!
" A critic who was more than just all thumbs
",-0.2732,0.9845,2020-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Recently, I took to re-watching LIFE ITSELF.It was in the late '90s when I first began to read this critic on a regular basis -- his reviews and later his ""Movie Answer Man"" columns. I was a faithful reader, and the news of his death brought tears to my eyes. (Neither before nor since have I ever gotten teary eyed over a media personality or celebrity.)I never knew or even met this man, although I did manage to catch a glimpse of him in person at one of the Toronto International Film Festivals back in the early Aughts. Had I the opportunity to have met him, it would have been at the time one of the highlights of my life.I am older now and understand that Roger Ebert was human just like the rest of us. As this biopic relates, he had his personality flaws. Yet to this day Mr. Ebert remains a favorite writer of mine. His reviews I still read, as do the memoirs which this film is in part based on.As an aside, I never understood the reason for a *professional* film critic and consider the occupation to be somewhat elitist and hence overrated. The writings of the majority of paid movie reviewers I've always found to be somewhat on the cerebral and pretentious side -- too detached, rambling, and analytical. Roger's crisply written reviews, on the other hand, had an emotional depth and warmth which appealed to me.As LIFE ITSELF reveals, Roger would sometimes mingle and befriend actors of the very movies that it was his job to review. Not everyone in his line of work had thought this smart of him.He got married, for the first time, at the age of 50. His father was an electrician. Interestingly, Roger did not set out to become a film critic, but fell into the job, very early in his writing career. These are just some of the bits of trivia about the subject which are brought out in this affecting documentary tribute, that I like to watch on an annual basis.Incidentally, as one of Roger's faithful readers, I never read his reviews in order to be influenced by them. In fact, quite a number of his favorable and panned reviews I happen to disagree with. For me, he was a brilliant writer, first and foremost. For all I care, he could have been a culinary critic and I would have still consumed his writings, regardless, even though I'm not a foodie.LIFE ITSELF brings out the nostalgic side in me. I will always remember Roger for those articulate and insightful reviews of his which long ago introduced me to a whole new world of cinema, in the way of independent and foreign-language films. Up until that time, I'd been unaware that there was more to celluloid than just contrived big grossers, which often left me bored and which to this day I avoid at all costs.Admittedly, the TV show that Ebert was a co-host of might have played to the gallery, but anyone who followed him in print felt more in the textual presence of a great wise man than a mere film critic into telegenic thumbing.A final word: I would have given this film a full 10-star rating but for the non-appearance of Richard Roeper; conspicuous by his absence, and a curious if not inexcusable omission on the part of the director."
" Enthusiastic Thumbs Up!
",0.5411,0.9884,2019-08-18 00:00:00,9,"Life Itself, a comprehensive, honest biography of film critic and 1975 Pulitzer Prize winner Roger Ebert's life, (based on Ebert's own memoir of the same name, and directed by Steve James of Hoop Dreams), is a great movie; I think Roger would have given it a hearty Thumbs Up.Ebert had a modest upbringing in Urbana, Illinois, quickly rose in the ranks as a reporter and then film critic at the Chicago Sun-Times, going on to educate and influence the world about the power and beauty of films, and specifically, the ability of a cinematic experience to expand our worldview and compassion.I watched Ebert's various film critique shows for decades, beginning when I was a kid. I used to record the shows and watch them to help me determine which movies I might want to see. In viewing this very well organized, touching and witty documentary, I realized what an impact Roger Ebert had on my life.His early drive as a writer, a voice of political reason, young carousing, social alchoholic, (who later got and remained sober), with a bent for Russ Meyers films as well as film classics, foreign and independent fare, and a wholly passionate approach to his work as film reviewer is covered, as well as his rivalry-inspired chemistry with fellow critic and long-time TV show partner, Gene Siskel. Some of the footage with Siskel is hysterical. Friends and colleagues, (including Martin Scorsese and also, Gene Siskel's widow, Marlene Iglitzen), as well as his wife, Chaz Ebert give revealing, sizzling , heartful interviews. Roger himself also has much screentime as he is interviewed in the hospital late into his illness.In the last decade of his life, Roger had cancer of the thyroid and salivary glands and his lower jaw was removed, leaving him disfigured and unable to speak or eat normally. Regardless of this awful physical predicament, Roger glowed with love for his wife and family, and life itself, and he remained steadfast in his fervor for his work.I give Life Itself an enthusiastic THUMBS UP!"
" Two thumbs up!
",0.0,0.91,2019-07-03 00:00:00,9,"A great, touching, and at times hard to watch documentary that sums up and celebrates a huge force in popular culture."
" Sad but gratifying
",0.5267,0.9933,2019-01-22 00:00:00,8,"I started watching this and almost could not continue. I found the pictures of Roger after his surgery to be quite upsetting. Seeing his lower jaw hanging open with no teeth, or even a lower jaw was disturbing but it was worth it getting past that.This is another great movie that many people have not seen or even heard of, a hidden gem. It tells the amazing story of Roger's life, his successes, his demons, his challenging relationship with Gene Siskel and his amazing wife who he married later in life. The scenes with his wife and grandchildren are especially touching. This is a film of great joy and hope. Life is tough, but love will help us through."
" Someone Else's Shoes.
",0.0,0.9965,2018-08-09 00:00:00,9,"Life itself is a Documentary film about the life and career Roger Ebert a host on the very popular show Siskel and Ebert and a Pulitzer Prize-winning film critic. For about a day I debated whether I should write a review of this film at all. I had never watched the Siskel and Ebert show, never even read a word of Roger Ebert's countless film reviews. I was an outsider and felt that in a way my opinion was unimportant, but then I reflected back on the way that Roger democratized film criticism at the Conference on World Affairs with his Cinema Interrupts series, and I was sufficiently emboldened. 
 The film starts with a clip of Roger speaking about the advancement of civilization and the importance of empathy. When he mentions film he makes it clear that the most important thing a movie can do is put you in the shoes of someone else and give you that experience in a way no other media can. After watching Life Itself I am struck by just how perfectly Director Steve James and Roger Ebert accomplish this. I went from being someone who knew nothing of Roger to feeling as though we could have been friends. 
 This film made me do more than laugh and cry it drove me to take up writing movie reviews again! Roger had his own newspaper column at 15 years old when he was still delivering that same paper! My friends and I were newspaper boys for a short while in high school and none of us were bright enough to have written for the advertisement and coupon holder of a paper we delivered! As much of a hit to the ego as this all was I couldn't help but be inspired by the ability Ebert displayed. This was a young man who at one point literally stopped the presses! 
 We are taken through time in a mostly linear fashion during the movie aside from the occasional interviews with Roger in the hospital. The film starts by giving us an idea of Roger's childhood and the relationship he had with his parents through questions posed in the interview, quotes from his memoir, and photographs from his youth. The Documentary skillfully continues to weave together interviews with friends, family, and excerpts from Rogers's reviews, along with many photos and video clips. Director Steve James pulls all these fragments together giving us a clear impression of Roger's life. 
 Some of the most memorable clips were of the behind the scenes bickering between Gene Siskel and Roger on the Siskel and Ebert show. The two of them would do anything to knock the other off his game and always had a snarky remark for when the other messed up a take! Over time though they started to gain respect for each other and even grew close when doing the later seasons of the show. 
 As the feature comes to a close we are introduced to more of Rogers health struggles and hear more from his wife and family. There are many touching exchanges that are initiated by Roger who has seemingly come to terms with his mortality and wishes to put things in order. Emails between Roger and Steve the director become more labored and eventually stop. When Roger posts his final blog entry you feel as if you've lost an old friend. 
 Documentary films offer us something other movies can not. We are given a window into the lives of people rather than characters, life rather than cleverly or clumsily written stories. I have developed a deep adoration for a man who only a few days ago I knew barely a thing about. Life Itself is a beautiful walk in someone else's shoes."
" A reminder of what film could/should be
",0.0,0.9313,2017-12-26 00:00:00,9,"At this film's outset, Ebert talks about movies being ""machines for empathy,"" and this film was just that. It moved me, to tears and to laughter. James managed to capture the beauty of a well lived, even with only a couple months to work. There were so many little moments that were beautiful, and I think that's true for all of us."
" Until next time, the balcony is closed.
",0.0,0.9676,2017-12-18 00:00:00,9,"In 2013, a bright light went out in the world. Someone who very early on inspired me to not only enjoy watching movies, but to be excited by them. Someone who taught me that nearly anyone could participate in film analysis and pass some amount of judgment (good or bad) about the films I watch. He was Roger Ebert.I loved to see him spar with Richard Roeper in the early 2000's on movies as inconsequential as Death to Smoochy. Clearly, Ebert put his heart on his sleeve when it came to most films and it offended him the most when a film wasted his time. On the other hand, when he adored a film, his praise was simply poetic. He had a way with words, man.. and he knew a good film when he saw one. If Ebert said to go see it, I would usually follow suit. His criticism was astute, meaningful and 9 times out of ten, summed up what he just watched in the most precise way.Life Itself honors him in the way he should've always been honored. Someone far beyond your average, pompous film critic. An average midwestern guy who loves a good flick, but smart enough to have received a Pulitzer Prize. Such a common man's film critic, he might as well have stood on a soapbox outside the theater he attended in Chicago to profess his feelings. Life Itself articulates the anger we all felt when he lost the ability to speak. We see Roger struggle to live any kind of peaceful life, having to constantly go to the hospital for physical therapy. Filmed just a few months prior to his death, it is difficult and angering to watch him suffer. One must wonder, had Roger been able to speak, what would he say? Had his life turned into one of those bad movies he's reviewed in his lifetime?But what will never change from Ebert is his profound affect on the film industry and how fellow filmmakers revered him, even though he may have maligned their films when he felt it was necessary. There's really something to be said about that. Thumbs way, way up."
" A Documentary that can make you sympathize with a person, even if you never knew their work.
",0.0,0.9708,2017-04-25 00:00:00,8,"Now admittedly, I was not very familiar with Roger Ebert's work or career until right before I watched this film; I actually was surprised to learn that he had passed away, due to the fact that I still see reviews from his website everywhere. My only real knowledge of him was that he was essentially the go-to film critic, and the primary face of film criticism. But after watching this film, I don't feel like I know every single bit and piece of the man's work, and because of that I feel like this movie did exactly what it wanted to do, for better or for worse. ""Life Itself"" strikes the perfect balance between informing the viewer on its subject while still not spoon feeding the viewer; we aren't given every little detail of Ebert's life, but a flowing narrative that informs us on his character and his career. This movie serves more it seems as a visual companion piece of his autobiography, as many excerpts from it are used in the film, and in that regard I think it really works very well. This film never paints Ebert as perfect, but it always shows the right balance of sympathy and realism to really feel like Roger Ebert as a person is encapsulated well in this film. This movie isn't about a movie critic as much as it's about a man's life. A man who just happened to have a deep passion for film criticism. And ultimately, this film does an excellent job of representing a man whose impact on the realm film criticism very well, albeit with the occasionally pacing issue or interview that feels a little unnecessary. Overall, I can definitely recommend ""Life Itself"" to any movie fan. 8.7/10"
