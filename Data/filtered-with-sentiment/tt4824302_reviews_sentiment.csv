" Funny, entertaining and feel good movie
",0.8271,0.9237,2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,Not sure about the low ratings. It's a simple funny entertaining movie. Watch it if you want relax and enjoy. Being a mother I love this movie.
" Mother's Day
",0.0,0.996,2021-03-18 00:00:00,4,"This movie follows on from Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve, all-star ensemble cast movies from returning director Garry Marshall (Beaches, Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride), essentially using the same concept as Love Actually. I watched it when it was broadcast on television on the actual Mother's Day. Basically, Mother's Day is approaching, and many unconnected characters in Atlanta are reconsidering their relationships, including with their mothers. Sandy Newhouse (Jennifer Aniston) is a divorced mother of two boys whose ex-husband, Henry (Timothy Olyphant), has recently got married to a younger woman, Tina (Shay Mitchell). Sandy finds it hard to get used to this, as it messes with plans to spend time with her children. Bradley Barton (Jason Sudeikis), a former marine, has recently suffered the death of his wife Dana (Jennifer Garner), a Marine Lieutenant, he and his two daughters miss her terribly. Miranda Collins (Razzie nominated Julia Roberts) is an accomplished author and television personality who appears to have no children and is focusing on her career. Kristin (Britt Robertson) is a mother to a daughter and is pondering whether to marry the father, up-and-coming stand-up comedian Zack (Jack Whitehall), her boyfriend who she lives with and is competing in a stand-up contest to win a big cash prize. Kristin, who was given up for adoption at birth, contemplates the missing part in her life and her friend Jesse (Razzie nominated Kate Hudson) encourages her to search for her birthmother. Jesse and her sister Gabi (Sarah Chalke) have their own issues with their parents, who they feel are too racist and homophobic to be in their lives. Jesse is married to Russell (Aasif Mandvi), a man of Indian descent, and Gabi is a lesbian and married to her girlfriend Max (Cameron Esposito), and have adopted Gabi and Russell's son, Charlie (Owen Vaccaro). The sisters are surprised when their parents, Earl (Robert Pine) and Florence ""Flo"" (Margo Martindale), suddenly show up, and plenty of catching-up is in order. Sandy meets Bradley in the supermarket, and later in hospital, and they form a close connection. Sandy hopes to get a job designing sets for Miranda, who is shocked when her adult daughter Kristin shows up wanting to connect with her. Kristin decides, following Zack's surprise victory at the stand-up contest, to surprise him by proposing marriage to him, which he accepts. Earl and Flo are shocked when they realise Jesse has married a man of colour and they have a child, but after an online conversation with Russell's mother Sonia (Anoush NeVart), she and Earl slowly they learn to accept these things. All the characters happily spend time with their mothers, and most continue with their relationships, and those that have just begun. Also starring Hector Elizondo as Lance Wallace, Matthew Walker as Randy the Clown, Jon Lovitz as Club Owner Wally Burn, Genevieve Joy as herself, Mia Jackson as herself, Ella Anderson as Vicky Barton, Jessi Case as Rachel Barton, Larry Miller as Motorcycle Cop, Family Guy's Christine Lakin as Railroad Crossing Hostess, and the voice of Penny Marshall as Opening Mom Narrator. Like Love Actually the makers seem a bit more interested in getting the big names in and not concentrating enough on trying to make the audience laugh a lot. Aniston is amusing talking and ranting to herself loudly, Roberts is too smiley and workaholic, it is good to see British comic Whitehall in an American movie, Martindale is interesting as the casually racist mother, and the other cast members do what they're meant to. The film is daft old fashioned chick flick mush and hardly worth watching, if you want to see big stars brought together, fair enough, and you might titter in moments, otherwise it is just a silly romantic comedy. Okay!"
" The main cast make this an OK watch, if not necessarily a good one
",0.1348,0.9708,2021-03-14 00:00:00,6,"Alright viewing. Nothing worth remembering or revisiting though.'Mother's Day' has a good cast list. Jennifer Aniston is always a pleasant watch, as she is here as Sandy. Kate Hudson, Julia Roberts and Jason Sudeikis also feature. I liked all three of them, they and Aniston are certainly the strongest parts of the film.Garry Marshall staple HÃ©ctor Elizondo also appears, he is as likeable as he is in, e.g., 'The Princess Diaries'. Jack Whitehall and Britt Robertson are together in this, I found Whitehall a bit wooden to be honest. Elsewhere, they somehow make Margo Martindale unlikeable - I've only seen her in sweet roles before, but her Florence (and Robert Pine's Earl) is rather detestable. That whole 'arc' is poorly written.Not as cheesy as predicted, even if it still does feature a fair amount of cheddar. The main cast make this an OK watch, if not necessarily a good one."
" I enjoyed it.
",0.5106,0.1531,2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"Mothers Day is a 2016 comedy drama and its the last movie Gary Marshall directed before his timing death. The movie stars Julia Roberts,Jennifer Aniston,Jason Sudakis,Kate Hudson,Britt Robertson and Hector Elizondo. The film is centered on 4 people. Sandy( Aniston) who's a divorced mother to 2 sons who's husband is now married to a younger woman named Tina(Shay Mitchell), Jessie(Hudson) who's married to an Indian while her sister(Sarah Chalke) is married to a woman, Bradley(Sudakis) who's a widowed father as his wife(Jennifer Garner in a surprise cameo) passed away since she was a LT in the Marines and finally Kristen (Robertson) who's dating a British man named Zac(Whitehall in his movie debut) who is looking for her birth mother who gave her up for adoption when she was just a baby (turns out its no other than Julia Roberts).And thats it. overall if you loved Valentines Day,New Years eve or if your a fan of the late Gary Marshall's work then check it out."
" No clear storyline
",0.1027,-0.2163,2021-02-27 00:00:00,3,"Pretty poor film. Too many characters and no thread or clear storyline. Found myself bored and looking at my phone at regular intervals, which is never a good sign. Not the worst film I've seen but definitely not the best."
" Horrible
",-0.5423,-0.2617,2020-12-13 00:00:00,1,"So let's get a ton of famous actors together and everyone will watch it anyway. Why bother in writing a decent script. ðŸ™„ Even though it's a movie of average length, it felt sooo long. Didn't get me to laugh even once. Not that I was expecting a quality movie but tis was just an all time low."
" Beautiful and sensitive...
",0.5994,0.9837,2020-10-13 00:00:00,9,"I love these films with interrelated groups, and especially when the theme is motherhood, I was able to delight, cheer and thrill, in a mixture of romance, comedy and drama, all very adorable and sensitive, a little exaggerated and very engaging, big names, great script, total chemistry..."
" I had high hopes for this move but that soon went away 30 minutes in.
",0.2263,0.7717,2020-09-29 00:00:00,3,"Audiences who like a shred of cohesive story telling or characterization, or even a chuckle during a supposed comedy, should stay very far away."
" I loved this movie
",0.5994,-0.0258,2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,I have now seen 3108 movies and this is my first review ever. I don't get it why this movie gets bad reviews. This is a good movie I laugh and cry trough the movie.
" It's a nice feel good comedy...
",0.6908,0.8951,2020-08-16 00:00:00,6,"And I don't agree with some of the reviewers over here. Look, it's not the best one of Garry Marshall's, but it is not the worst. I mean, come on, no one is claiming that this is a masterpiece. It's just another movie that makes you feel good and smile and probably wanna call your mom.
I know there are some cheesy scenes that you can see in this kind of movies, like the classic reunited mother-daughter scene between Julia Roberts and Britt Robertson (adopted child finding her birthmother after sooo many years) or the lying daughters' lies all come out with a surprise visit from the parents, etc.
And I have to say I was really pissed at first all the racists and homophobic comments of the Texan couple (as you can imagine) but in the end they got reconciliation and this was the movie's main point.
So, it is not a total waste of time, you will not regret it, there were really good comedy scenes, but obviously it will not be a classic."
" Truly, astonishingly bad
",-0.1531,-0.7351,2020-08-08 00:00:00,1,"Easily the worst writing of any feature I've ever seen (it was the only non-news English-language programming on Greek TV). I've seen episodes of The Brady Bunch infinitely more witty, complex and true to life. Embarrassing to watch; must have been a constant humiliation on the set."
" Good comedy movie
",0.6597,0.9788,2020-07-20 00:00:00,10,"I honestly don't get the ratings and the reviews - something wrong with the expectations maybe? For me this was a great feel good, comedy movie with great actors. Good topic, nice plot (for a comedy movie), good acting... Absolutely enjoyable to watch. I have seen it a couple of times and it is for me a go to on a rainy evening."
" Not bad
",0.431,0.9706,2020-06-30 00:00:00,6,"This movie is entertaining and filled with laughable moments, but it's not as amazing as Valentines Day. The story lines was alright and relatable. The acting was great from all the actors and actresses. The jokes were funny but I have seen this movie plenty of times and never realized how offensive many of the jokes were. Overall, it's fun to watch for every Mother's Day."
" Not bad
",0.431,-0.3573,2020-06-17 00:00:00,7,"I was surprised to see so many negative reviews. Sure enough, this is a no-Oscar movie, quite average. It is more than OK to kill an evening. Just don't have too much expectations. It is in no way boring, it's just very down to earth. Exactly what you have in real life.
Perhaps, not everyone can appreciate it for what it is - a life story of a mom with two kids, whose father found a new love and left... which, actually, utterly destroyed her perspective on life. So, being married and having kids is actually a must to watch this title. Just imagine your current partner leaving... and your kids, the only thing you have left, starting to spend more time with the new ""mom"". This is the drama part.
Then we have a couple of stories for the comedy, and a little bit for romance.
All things considered, I expected to see at least 6.5 rating."
" Painful to watch
",-0.4404,-0.9044,2020-06-07 00:00:00,2,This turkey of a movie terribly written terribly acted and an embarrassment for the high quality cast involved. I do not recommend it.
" Disappointed
",-0.4767,-0.2382,2020-05-19 00:00:00,5,"I want to say that this movie has some of the best actors in the world, but this movie is a waste of them."
" Too narrow focus and not well done
",-0.2057,0.9966,2020-05-11 00:00:00,5,"The focus of the movie is on mothers, but it's very narrow. So, if you're not an active mother (say, a man), it's not relatable. Outside the story of several moms, there's not much else and their stories are really very focused on them being mothers, not so much on other people in their lives and how they interact.Also, the connection between these several women seem artificial, it's kind of obvious they are put together with no substantial connection, just to increase the number of mothers and their life situations.Now, there are good comedies with much less to go on, if there's enough jokes and fun. But, here there isn't. There are a few good jokes and some fun, mostly towards the end. That's not really enough to make up for its issues.Acting is also sub-par. Essentially none of the mothers does a good job, well, unless you count the Jennifer Garner cameo, but, it's really too short and special to be counted. Some fair better than others, Sarah Chalke is OK, quirky as she know how to be. Julia Roberts, in a supporting role here, is mostly uninteresting, until the end, where she proves that she (still) has the best legs, with all other much younger than her, some twice younger. Jennifer Aniston, who's supposed to be more-or-less the protagonist, is really off here, even though she has probably the best material to work with. It isn't so much that she's doing Friends' Rachel, which she does do too much, but, she's just doing things wrong and not being funny during the process.The only one who's really good (and with a substantial role) here is Jason Sudeikis. He has had more misses than hits in his career as it moved along, but, here he's spot on, he's funny without even trying."
" Heartfelt movie
",0.5423,0.9686,2020-05-06 00:00:00,7,"Honestly for the first half of the movie, I was not really sure if I should continue watching this. But I'm glad chose to continue watching cause the 2nd half of the movie was awesome. Heartfelt so feel good movie"
" NOT a family film!
",0.0,0.68,2020-03-22 00:00:00,1,"Thankfully, having recorded this for family viewing, I read that this features a lesbian character and thus having checked a few reviews this ISNT suitable family viewing for those who are of the ""old fashioned"" type folk like me. Distinct turn off!"
" Among the worst films
",-0.6249,-0.7792,2020-01-30 00:00:00,1,"A movie that will embarrass human beings, the movie is very bad, jokes are worse than that..."
" Enjoyable happy movie
",0.765,0.9805,2019-12-28 00:00:00,7,"Not my usual kind of movie but a really nice afternoon family movie with humour, fun, good sentiment and moments you can see coming but still a good laugh and a 'happy' movie."
" Terrible film.
",-0.4767,-0.6583,2019-11-24 00:00:00,1,"This movie should seriously be banned. It is full of not funny  jokes. The whole film is so messy with dialogue which lacks insight and inspiration. Cast full of great actors, whom all give average performances. What a waste."
" What a missed opportunity!
",0.2244,0.8648,2019-06-30 00:00:00,3,"I guess this movie never meant to be a classic, but with such a great cast it could have been an enjoyable, even rewatchable comedy, despite a story full of clichÃ©s. Oh, boy, they didn't even come close to that. The situations and the dialogues are all so badly written, it's a miracle how this was even greenlit. The ""big speeches"" are so dumb, sometimes it is literally painful to listen to them and one can only wonder how they affect anyone in any way. The only reason this movie doesn't get the lowest score from me is the cast. But what wonders could have they done with a good script!"
" A++ for triteness
",0.0,-0.886,2019-05-28 00:00:00,3,I don't know where to begin with how lame and unimaginative and just how boring this was. I was too bored to even fall asleep to it. What a waste of the actors involved in it. I gave it a 3 cos the standup comedy scenes were actually funny.I wonder how many of the people who thought this was a good movie also dissed The Tourist. It would make sense... in a sad and pathetic kind of way.
" Light-hearted and cute
",0.4588,0.9889,2019-05-16 00:00:00,8,"I waited awhile to see this movie because of the reviews it received. If you are wanting to see a dramatic, deep, and moving movie then the reviews are correct. But, I wasn't and therefore the reviews are wrong. It was simply sweet and cute. I laughed and I even got a little teary-eyed when reflecting upon my own relationship that I do not have with my mother. The story lines are pretty accurate, but exaggerated so there will be a cute vibe and subtle drama. I loved the references to other movies and shows. I loved this movie! So glad I silenced the reviews and gave it a shot. It made for the perfect lazy afternoon."
" Skip the film, stay for the credits
",0.3612,0.1027,2019-05-14 00:00:00,4,"The ending credits are sprinkled with cute outtakes, and are the only amusing bits of this painfully contrived movie. The plot is onion paper thin, however the actors do an amazingly decent job, due to Garry Marshall's directing abilities no doubt."
" Routien annual interconnected dramedy movie
",0.0,-0.9458,2019-04-17 00:00:00,2,"Everything about this movie was so forced and pushed, the director, the writers and the producers probably all got hernia. Why try to make all these subplots run together in a single movie? None of them got serious development. I bet these were all single script rejects and someone decided to make a Frankenstein movie out of it. Well it sucks. It was boring and tedious and completely non-engaging. I think I laughed only at the pox whistle. I understand this movie is targeted at suburban middle class women in their 40's and 50's, and it shows. This movie is so detached from reality, only detached from reality living in a bubble spoiled women could enjoy it. This movie made me depressed. It was like staring at someones fake smile for 2 hours. Absolute torture. And the wedding scene was just the soulless cherry on top of this pile of materialized life disappointment for divorced women. Avoid at all cost or you will want to jump from a bridge."
" Bland but harmless
",0.3612,0.7282,2019-03-31 00:00:00,1,"It was watchable but very predictable, maybe 2 jokes made me laugh. Just seemed to pander to a certain crowd so outside that you wouldn't like it. Wouldnt recommend you watch"
" worse than jack and jill
",-0.4767,-0.049,2019-02-27 00:00:00,1,This is without a shadow of a doubt the worst movie I have seen in the last two years. Julia Roberts (who looks fab) is the one saving grace. I feel robbed of 90min from my life and will be following up with the producers separately for some form of compensation
" Please Garry Marshall just stop!
",0.1007,-0.5475,2019-02-05 00:00:00,3,"First we had Valentine's Day then New Year's eve and now Mother's Day. I can't wait for his next films Arbor Day and Boxing Day with only Canadian actors.It's another ensemble cast movie set around Mother's Day. We got Mother's like Bubba Gump had shrimp. We got your divorced mother, We got new step mother, We got interracial mother, we got gay mothers, we got dead mothers, we got racist mothers, and we even got mom's giving up babies for adoption reconnecting mothers! You want it, we got it!A few cheap laughs and pulls on the heart strings but it's a cookie cutter bore."
" Worst movie I've ever seen
",-0.6249,-0.9332,2019-01-31 00:00:00,1,"I couldn't figure out what this movie was about based on the trailer I watched a few times. I watched the movie anyways and never figured out what it was about. There is NO storyline, just a bunch of random scenes thrown together to make it seem like a movie?! As soon as it was over (I can't believe I watched the entire thing) I was so pissed off that I wasted that much time watching this garbage. Ugh what an awful piece of crap. Please do not waste your time. If I could give this movie a zero I would."
" A Perfect Contemporary Mother's Day Treat
",0.7506,0.9922,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"3 May 2016. This movie hits all the emotional buttons of contemporary mothers everywhere. In some ways, perhaps too well. This is like an updated, saccharine Mother Knows Best, like the 50s television series Father Knows Best but in a great way. For Millenials, however, this movie might be too tame and for older men, this movie might be like watching some unrelatable foreign movie. See the almost unbelievable division of IMDb ratings for this movie.For the rest of us, this movie reveals much of what most Americans experience but hide and avoid talking or feeling about. Garry Marshall has once again created fabulous comedy-drama that somehow with all the multitudinous characters the story lines remain intelligible and entertaining. This movie taps into and reveals many of the hidden difficulties of being both a female and a mother and acknowledges their wonderful and vital contribution to humanity. By tapping into the female psyche and offering a mainstream audience a view of a ""politically correct"" or better yet, a more realistic but morality lesson, Mothers Day is a tribute to better, quality movies so sorely under-rated by the male film industry and those that can't comprehend what this movie is really about."
" Average

" Highly Inauthentic
",0.0,0.9209,2018-08-24 00:00:00,4,"(Flash Review)The movie is about a bunch of various families, their uniqueness and their plans for an upcoming Mother's Day. In particular a recently divorced mother who's ex married a much younger women and her emotions around that. The movie did manage to elicit a smattering of chuckles and was lightly entertaining. Drama is generated by manufactured scenarios and the only emotion the viewer feels is what is they brought from their own life experience. Plot points are rooted in reality yet masked by an insincere and artificial facade. The editing is choppy and clunky with better cinematography seen on many television sitcoms. Using an abundance of A-list actors, many of whom had minimal screen time, the movie's goal of an easy draw to get mothers to relax for an afternoon on Mother's Day was probably achieved. But mothers deserve a better effort. This film takes too many easy shortcuts."
" Perpetuating stereotypes
",0.0,0.5647,2018-07-26 00:00:00,5,"There were some fun parts but I was disappointed because:
Those awkward jokes about feeling awkward about period when it;s something normal, making women feel bad about thir bodies.
The 'miserable' business woman becomes happy only when she meets her daughter. (perpetuating the stereotype of a woman being fulfilled only by motherhood).
It was mentioned that only mothers know how to take care of children best, which is wrong.
The good parts were the messages about racism and the lesbian couple."

" Lousy Movie.
",-0.5423,-0.4682,2018-07-08 00:00:00,2,"A film as arbitrary as the day it ""celebrates"", this was clearly a case of trying to fit a bunch of characters and events around a central theme - and failing.The lazy writers (5 of them!) give us a set of cookie-cutter characters - the lesbian moms, the interracial couple, the adopted daughter and her celebrity birth-mother, the bigoted grandparents, the cute British guy, the sad widower and his teenaged daughters, the frazzled divorcee - and connects them all together via a contrived and unsatisfying ""storyline"", culminating in an abrupt and anticlimactic ending.There are no laughs in this ""comedy"", and very little romance. There is no real drama. Zero actual story, besides the thinnest thread of narrative that binds the characters uncomfortably into a single film. There is really nothing at all to see here, except a couple of has-been movie stars, a few up-and-comers, and a llama.Whatever meagre offerings are served up in this film, you can see done much better in a dozen other films. It gets two stars from me, not because it's worthy of them particularly, but because there are films even worse."

Then Henry remarries, to a hot 20-something. Meanwhile, author and shopping channel host Miranda has a secret. Meanwhile, sisters Jesse and Gabi live next door to each other but their redneck racist homophobic parents don't know that one of them is gay and the other is married to an Indian. Meanwhile, Bradley, father of two girls (one of whom is newcomer Ella Anderson as plain but likeable almost-pubescent daughter Vicky) is still having difficulty in getting past the death of his wife over a year ago. Meanwhile, Zach wants to marry Kristin, mother of their daughter, but she has an issue. And Mother's Day is coming up... Like its predecessors in Garry Marshall's holiday romance anthology series, this film is broadly likeable, populated by a good cast, featuring multiple, lightly interlinked threads where quite nice people face not very serious problems which get neatly and sometimes improbably resolved by the end, and which leaves you with very little aftertaste. It's all pretty inconsequential.That's not to say it's bad - it's too anodyne to be bad, but it's like a meal which is pleasant enough to eat but afterwards you wonder why you didn't choose something with a bit more spice in it.I was going to say that there's nothing to take offence at, but the sisters' racist homophobic parents are fairly offensive. As someone with a moderate sense of dramatic structure, however, I found their utterly unjustified (from the point of view of character) change of attitude even more offensive: the film provided no reason why they shouldn't have been as racist and homophobic at the end as they were at the start.Did it matter? Probably not. Nothing in this film matters very much. It's like spending a pleasant evening in the company of some people you're friends, but not deep friends, with. Next day you can't even remember what you talked about.."

This was the most predictable and lazily written movie I have seen since, well, any number of the other formulaic tripe that we see come out of LaLa land. The actors had to know what a poor script this was. They probably got paid a lot just to show up and recite thier lines.

The racist parents from Texas who only drink American beers and hates gay people? Check. The same parents don't know that their one daughter is gay and in a committed relationship? Check. The other daughter is married to a man from a different culture? Check. A successful entrepreneur who doesn't have kids and is so focused on her career? Check. The same woman is hiding the fact she had a child at one time? Check. A divorced mom who soon discovers her ex husband's much younger new wife isn't so bad after all? Check. 
I could go on and on and on which it what it seems like this movie does as it fills in its movie paint-by-number script. There isn't one funny line in the entire movie. Even the stand up comedian doesn't have one funny joke but gets a lot of laughs during his sets. He even wins a stand up contest with his ""improv"" about his baby (which wasn't funny at all). Here are a couple of other notes I mentally took as I zoned out listening to this movie:
A child with asthma who has an attack while at his step mom's house. Step calls bio mom in panic because the inhaler is empty. Bio first tells step to put him near an open freezer because it helps him breathe (SINCE WHEN HAS THIS EVER BEEN THE CASE FOR AN ASTHMATIC?) but second, tells step that there is a back up inhaler in his backpack. Don't you think you would mention that first. And don't you think the kid would know that too?? 
For the storyline regarding the racist parents, how could they have not known about their daughter's husband and grandson that is at least 8 years old? They haven't even spoken in that amount of time but suddenly show up as a surprise for mother's day? What about the big holidays like Christmas, or milestone birthdays?
The town holds a Mother's Day parade?with floats and things. Huh? I have never heard of such a thing. Have you? 
The interior designer has a website that looks like a page from 1995 in a beginning html class. I wouldn't hire a designer with a site done so poorly. This was such a waste of the talents of Julia Roberts, Asif Mandi, Jason Sudekis, Jennifer Aniston, and others. And it's a sad way to remember Garry Marshall."
" Despite places of disappointing writing, some real, real-life gold
",0.3875,0.8444,2018-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I would have loved to have given this movie a 9 or 10, but couldn't. First, the wonderful elements of this movie (two categories), from lesser to greater: 1. Four great roles, with four great actors, doing wonderful work: Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Timothy Olyphant, and Julia Roberts, all doing some wonderful work in their characters' roles, whenever the script and plot will allow them to do so; 2. The fantastic, real-life themes this movie addresses: grieving for a deceased spouse who was greatly loved, grieving over a marriage now in divorce, the pain of rejection (in several characters in several ways), the pain of an ex-spouse's remarriage, being a single dad, being a single mom, conflicted feelings about an ex's new spouse, struggles with the unfairness of life, experiencing lack of appreciation from one's kids, insecurities that come with being adopted, deep regret over giving a child up for adoption, the hardship of divorce and the post-divorce relationship, and the fear of being rejected a second time by meeting one's biological parent(s). Wow: what a list. And all these are done well and mostly very honestly--really, really, with high quality. This is real-life stuff--stuff of real pain and sadness--and this movie nearly ""knocks it out of the park"" on these things, both in plot and acting. However, the plot fails many times these themes and does not allow these actors to bring the themes to the great, cathartic end they should have had. That said, there's another 50% of the movie that deals with other characters, unsupported changes-of-heart and renewed relationships, and plot-lines (huge cast; many stories going on at once, and that's OK) that I considered ""throw-away."" The story line of worth is that with the four characters I've named. 20% of the movie had me rolling my eyes, but the good parts, the good acting, the good lines, the real-life themes with which the movie deals make that WELL worth it, and push an otherwise ""4"" movie all the way to a ""7"" in my book. I almost gave it an ""8."" The movie's downfall is from its lack of awareness of what it is--the writer and director (mostly writer) didn't know if he/she was making a comedy, a tragedy, or a drama of mixed measures of hope. The movie is the latter two, but attempts comedy, with stupid characters (yes, I'm looking at you, sisters' parents, Dr., and Dr.'s mom). Fortunately, these things don't get in the way too much of the good half of the movie and plot-ilnes. Were the bad-half of the movie/characters removed, there would have been room (time) to develop the good half 40% more. This is going on my list of great movies that show the value of marriage and the hurt of broken relationships therein. Incidentally, Jason Sudeikis's ""Hall Pass"" not only has a similar feel, but also a good message in the same direction."

Not sure who owed who a favor, but this should have never been a feature film. It's basically an average Lifetime movie, but gets a slight bump only because of Jennifer Aniston, who always pulls off these safe familiar roles with some spark and even some depth, but that isnt enough to help save an otherwise horribly predictable and flat script."

" Garry Marshall's holiday comedy pits an inspiring ensemble cast in a joyless comedic fare that bears nothing resembling charm
",0.6049,-0.8758,2017-11-12 00:00:00,2,"Garry Marshall's third foray into a supposed trilogy of holiday- themed dramedies following 'Valentine's Day' and 'New Years Eve' marks yet another film involving a large ensemble cast of A-list actor and actresses placing themselves in witless comedic fare. This film sets stone to a spiritless comedic wasteland where the talent of the large cast is buried under Marshall's perfunctory approach at portraying family values and individuals coming to terms with their relationships with their mothers, and that includes squandering the comedic chemistry each member of the cast has demonstrated in the past. Those poor souls who bother to sit through this near two hours of tediousness are bound to be left questioning what kind of wit is Marshall expecting to squeeze out of a story dealing the dynamics of Mother's Day when tied to a script that fails to provide the cast with even an inch of wiggle room to flex their talent muscles. Following the familiar story structure of 'Valentine's Day' and 'New Years Eve', this movie focuses on three interconnecting families on their celebration of Mother's Day including Sandy (played by Jennifer Aniston), a recently divorced woman who is disillusioned y her ex-husband upon learning he is married to a new woman Tina (played by Shay Mitchell) who barely looks like she's in her early twenties. Then there is sisters Jesse (played by Kate Hudson) and Gabi (played by Sara Chalke) who are paid an unexpected visit from their parents who are not pleased to learn the former is married to an Indian (played by Aasif Mandvi) and the latter is a lesbian. Next, we have Kristin (played by Britt Robertson) who is pregnant and is facing anxiety by marrying her longtime boyfriend, while coming to terms with her estranged mother (played by Julia Roberts). Finally, there is Bradley (played by Jason Sudeikis), a widowed father who must learn with his two daughters to celebrate Mother's Day for the first time since their mother's death. Garry Marshall doesn't go all out with a laugh-out-loud comedic flair, but instead tries arming the film with a heartfelt story with a comedic undertone that fails to compensate for how charmless it is. Marshall's sense of humor leave the film aggressively restrained to what feels like a series of sitcom episodes stretched into a lame two-hour skit that the actors never rehearsed for. Nearly every moment of humor fails to land, often resulting in one eye-rolling joke after another, while the more dramatic moments where audiences are supposedly intended to reach for the tissues simply fall flat. As poignant as it tries to be, the storyline concerning Jason Sudeikis helping his daughters come to terms with the death of their mother fails to touch the heart in a way it intends, which explains why I never found myself grabbing any tissues. As for the comedy bits, it appears as the film's definition includes Kate Hudson and Sara Chalke being the daughters of parents who are apparently racist and homophobic, Jennifer Aniston constantly whining about her ex- husband being married a woman who likes too young to even be in college, and Jason Sudeikis trying to break it down in a karaoke, only to subject himself into a cheesy slapstick gag even children who find overly derivative. In shorts, it's just plain stupid. And if that is not worse, one should consider the erratic editing in numerous scenes that take their time to set up a joke only to cut to another scene before the supposedly climatic gag occurs. If you find yourself laughing more than once, that would be called a miracle because funny is far from the appropriate word to describe this horribly misguided dramedy. Mother's Day is tedious, unfunny, and severely lacking in charm; and at the worst, showcases its usually talented stars exercising at the lowest peak of their careers. Offensively dumb and dry in cleverness, this film is instantly forgettable the minute the end credits begin to roll. Good word of advice: don't choose this as a movie to watch with your mother, just don't."
" A new unsuccessful way to use an old idea
",-0.3612,0.991,2017-09-19 00:00:00,5,"I understood a very long time ago, that you shouldn't base your opinion about film only by cast. And Mother's Day isn't an exception. Looking at the idea of the film, you might think that this will be another movie like ""Valentine's Day"". But, after I saw the trailer, I thought this might be a good and thoughtful film. Yet, after watching it, I only had a negative impression. Firstly, most of the slightest hints of clever topics are mixed with sometimes completely inappropriate humor. Secondly, the idea seems stretched, as if the director just wanted to make the film as long as possible and did not really worry about the script. Finally, most of the characters look like they're underdone, just as their dialogues. There are many funny, and at the same time clever and enlightening, dramas. However, I can't say that ""Mother's Day"" is one of them. It wasn't a total disaster, as this is an Ðµasy movie, which can theoretically be written in family-friendly and is good for evenings, when you have nothing else to watch. I wasn't expecting very much from this film, so I gave this film 5/10."

Can we stop putting this garbarge in films? So your eight year old boy can't handle shorts and pins? What are we teaching kids nowadays? Teach them not to look at women inappropriately. And then, we have the widowed dad who we are full of sympathy for until he's writing a shopping list which is new to him since his wife died, then his daughter requests tampons and he struggles to comprehend. He ends up not saying the word and can only manage to write down the initlal. If a dad can't handle to say the word tampon, he shouldn't have kids.

I saw the other similar named-after-holidays movies, and in my opinion, they're continually going downhill.I'm not telling you to avoid it. In fact, you'll probably want to see it. Since the cast is so huge, there will probably be someone in there whose films you never miss. Told in interweaving, seemingly unrelated but secretly super-related stories, Mother's Day is about a bunch of mothers trying to struggle through their difficult lives. Children, ex-husbands, secret marriages, step-mothers, friends of no help but plenty of quip, and actresses who make you point at the screen, exclaiming, ""Good God, she got old!"" make up this not-at-all-delightful romp.My weakness is Jennifer Aniston; I watch all her movies, even the terrible, rotten ones.

The cast is as likable as any you can get together in a movie and the scenarios are quite funny.Shay Mitchell of PLL is a scene stealer as younger second wife and she can hold her own in both looks and acting ability with the A list cast. Jennifer Aniston looks comfortably older as divorcÃ©e first wife. The funny situation is Kate Hudson's character hiding her Indian husband from her racist white trash parents. Brit Robertson never seems to look older than a teenager plays a woman with commitment issues. Julia Roberts looks deliberately I think a bit garish as a home shopping queen.Don't understand why people criticized this movie so badly. It's actually okay.

And I chuckled - very slightly - when Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) got her arm stuck in a candy vending machine. And that was about it for chuckles. I winced a lot more. I winced at the racial jokes - not that I'm especially fixated on political correctness, but just because that whole sideline wasn't funny. I winced at the Oh so obvious route the film was taking. I winced at Julia Roberts - never been a big fan, but frankly she was awful in this movie, and I can't really say that anybody else was much better. It just was not a very fun or funny movie to watch.It was Garry Marshall's last movie as a director. He died just a couple of months after it was released. It's unfortunate that he must have been aware of the deservedly bad reviews this got. Marshall has an impressive resume overall - but his ""holiday comedies"" aren't his best, and this may have been the worst of the three. It's one of those ""several separate stories"" that ultimately come together in some way. And, since it's about Mother's Day, they all revolve around motherhood in one way or another. One mother has to deal with a new and younger stepmother entering her children's lives; one mother has died, leaving her husband and two kids to try to move on; one mother doesn't want to get married to the father of her child because she was adopted and never knew her own mother; meanwhile, her mother is - well - Julia Roberts, in that awful performance; then there's the racist mother, whose two daughters are also mothers in potentially complicated relationships (one bi-racial relationship, one lesbian relationship.) It's a muddle of a movie. I'm not really a big fan of these intersecting story-line movies at the best of times. But this one really didn't work for me. (3/10)"
" It's all just bad, bad, bad
",-0.8885,-0.5719,2017-02-07 00:00:00,1,"This is one of those movies that doesn't have a script so much as talking points. Actors do a lot of mugging and spluttering in an attempt to emote and say words at the same time, and it doesn't always work. Jennifer Aniston and Kate Hudson are the worst offenders. These are actors who need a solid script with real words, or they just go off on tangents that look like exaggerated improv-class hamming. Aniston throwing a fit in her car is some of the worst acting I have seen on film in a long time; it was an embarrassment. Here is a wonderful comedic actress who has been given little to work with and no direction, and it shows. The scene where she goes off on her husband's new wife at a children's pageant is cringe-worthy, and only serves to make her character unappealing - who does she think she is to think that she has the right to reserve a chair in the front row just for her purse?In general, the acting is awful, and cartoonish. Even dependable veterans like Margo Martindale come off looking bad. She and her on- screen husband portray ignorant ""trailer trash"" in a way that is an insult to the audience's intelligence and to all people living in trailers everywhere; seeing the husband driving his RV while simultaneously sucking on a macerated chicken bone was one of the more egregious ham-fisted attempts at characterization in this movie, of which there are many. The extreme lop-sided hairstyle of the gay character is another example, as is her contribution of a ""womb"" float to the Mother's Day parade (although in this day of ""pussy protests"", perhaps not.) The action scene with the womb float chasing the trailer (for no apparent good reason) at dangerously high speeds through a highly populated town centre was wildly annoying as was the over-the-top backyard party scene with the large blow-up ""bouncy"" slide that deflates to comedic (NOT) hysteria. It's all just bad, bad, bad. I could go on, but I think I make my point. This is a movie that has too many moving parts, where everyone lives in a brightly coloured, high intensity cartoon world. There is too much pointless action, and mind-numbing dialogue that is obviously improvised by actors who really don't understand their characters. No one comes out of this movie looking good; even Jennifer Garner in a small cameo comes off looking like an amateur."

Each connection needs more time to develop and inhabit the situations. If this movie gets split into four, one or two hold the possibility of developing into a good story if I'm being generous. These A-list stars don't help either."
