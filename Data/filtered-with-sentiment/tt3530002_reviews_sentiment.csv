" Legitimately funny.
",0.4404,0.9776,2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,"'The Night Before (2015)' sees three lifelong friends try to get to the perfect Christmas Eve party as a way to end their yearly tradition. Along the way, they hit several bumps in the road and have to contend with their own issues, clashing with one another as all friends do around the holiday season. It's a fun, irreverent and often hilarious comedy that packs a surprising amount of character work into its relatively slender frame. Of course, its narrative essentially comes second to its humour; it's a good job that the thing is legitimately funny. Most 'comedies' struggle to get more than a few chuckles out of you, but this is consistently amusing and keeps a smile on your face throughout. It also provokes many, many belly laughs. It's a cohesive, Christmassy and sometimes ridiculous concoction that works far better than it perhaps ought to. 7/10"
" This movie is so bad that.....
",-0.6696,0.2263,2020-12-24 00:00:00,1,"1. I didn't even get halfway through.
2. I can't even stand to read the reviews about it. Reading about it just reminds me of the unfunny, corny, boring parts that I did see. It's pretty bad... at least the part that I did watch."
" Hilarious Christmas movie!!
",0.508,0.9677,2020-12-23 00:00:00,9,"Just watched this again last night and I laughed through this entire movie, lots of good actors & pretty good story. Looks like a bunch of nerds who are anti drugs gave this movie a 1 star, people take everything so seriously sometimes, this is classic Rogen. But if you're high af & looking for a great late night laugh fest then this is the movie for you! This is definitely in the Christmas rotation for me every year."
" It's ridiculous, but they make it work
",-0.1901,0.9943,2020-12-22 00:00:00,8,"Funny.'The Night Before' makes for very amusing viewing, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie are great together, I like all three actors individually and as a trio they are just as terrific - all give entertaining performances.Rogen plays the most obvious role for him yet absolutely nails it, Gordon-Levitt is probably the weaker of the three but is still pleasant to watch - as is Mackie. The casting is top notch, with supports like Michael Shannon and Tracy Morgan. There are other noteworthy faces involved too, like Ilana Glazer and Lorraine Toussaint.The plot isn't anything crazy or distinctive, yet still feels suitably fresh for the vast majority. I will say, though, the film does hit a bit of a wall at around the midway point, but thankfully picks up almost immediately - thanks to a great scene with a couple of fun cameos.An enjoyable film. It's ridiculous, but they make it work. Recommended."

" Nothing amazing, but pretty damn fun!
",-0.5954,0.9925,2020-12-17 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this film. Its light and breezy, full of good laughs, has a decent collection of characters, and a decent plot to boot.The chemistry between the three leads, Gordon-Levitt, Rogen and Mackie was fantastic. I loved all of them in this film and found them very enjoyable to watch together.In terms of plot, I appreciated the simplicity of it. Sometimes comedies can get a bit carried away and self involved, and try to construct an overly complicated and farcical plot, but this one was nice and simple. Beneath the simplicity was a decent amount of character development which I thought was quite well done.The comedy was pretty good too. I've never seen Seth Rogen fail to sell a comedy, so its not surprise that the film was funniest when he was on screen. A particular scene with him at a church service was a real highlight for me.Any comedy lovers be sure to give The Night Before a go as I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
" It's a great movie
",0.6249,0.9538,2020-12-16 00:00:00,8,"I guess you are going to find it diferently appealing depending on where you are at life. Guess that I just recognised somethings therefore enjoyed it. The fear of loosing friends, becoming irrelevant, not progressing as fast as your friends.The fact that sometimes drugs and alcohole is a remedy for those fun moments. Yea, this is not really a family film but maybe just a film for the average guy to watch. It has the bro humour, some cliches and so on. But I think it's okay, not everything needs to be original. Just fun, and following the main character was fun, he is sad, and the only thing keeping him from that scary thought of his lonelyness is his friends."

" Think 'before' you watch it.
",0.0,-0.8997,2020-12-09 00:00:00,5,"Not exactly destined to be a yule classic, The Night Before has a messy plot, a scattering of laughs and not very much of the Christmas spirit. As someone who watched it with me said: take out the festive songs and the assorted decorations, and this doesn't feel much like a Xmas movie at all.For a film ostentatiously targeted at adults, it's surprisingly tame... which makes the fleeting moments of sex, drug abuse and bad language stand out so much. Talk about an unhappy hybrid of a 'sweet' bromance and more graphic material.It also has three quite unlikeable main characters who talk and talk about stuff which isn't very interesting, and a whole load of random nonsense thrown in because I guess the writer ran out of inspiration along the way. Here's a tip: don't try to squeeze a hour-long flick into 100 minutes. It shows.That my favourite character is a lady who steals weed from our trio, robs the homeless and re-enacts scenes from better Christmas movies in a kind of weird pilgrimage should tell you everything to need to know. At least when she trips the fellas up with Micro Machines, or 'Hans Grubers' off of a building, it's entertaining and original. Most of the rest simply fails to come anywhere close.Final paragraph must go to Seth Rogan's wife, who's pregnant in this and urges her husband to have a 'safe' night... then proceeds to give him one of every narcotic in existence. She went on Craigslist you see, and brought them all, and... I'd like to say it makes sense in context, but I'd be totally lying. 5/10"

We found it consistently funny, very funny in quite a few places; not subtle obviously but none the worse for that, and a proper Christmas movie if you don't mind a bit of untraditional bad language. And the star turn was Miley Cyrus - she's hilarious, as well as belting out a great Wrecking Ball. I'm now a fan :)"
" Yule have seen it before.
",0.0,0.9953,2020-11-27 00:00:00,5,"Another Christmas movie added to Amazon was ""The Night Before"" and my selection rules meant that I watched it next. I didn't see this when it came out in 2015 and though I'm usually a fan of Rogan's comedies and whilst this has its moments, ultimately I wasn't missing out on much.Three friends, Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Isaac (Seth Rogan) and Chris (Anthony Mackie) have spent every Christmas eve together partying in New York, since Ethan's parents passed away in 2001. With Isaac about to start a family and Chris now a successful football star - they decide to end the tradition, but not before one last blowout, which is made extra special when Ethan scores tickets to the Nutcracker party, a legendary shindig that they've been hunting down for years.The film sees Rogan's stoner comedy age up a little bit - as it's acknowledged that drug fuelled nights out can't really continue into your thirties and so this night is special. The occasional gross-out moment remain - mostly centred around Rogan's aspect of the story. Gordon-Levitt has to come to terms with splitting up with his girlfriend, played by Lizzy Caplan - as well as the upcoming separation from his friends and the memories of his parents. Chris is dealing with his success that has come late and is built on using steroids. He loves the spotlight though, as isn't prepared to give it up.It's amusing, rather than funny - and I suppose that's the biggest problem for the comedy, I didn't hate it, but barely an hour after watching it I'm struggling to remember anything that made me laugh, apart from the scenes involving Michael Shannon - he's the films MVP. It's not particularly original either, lessons learned over Christmas has been done before and the film homages ""A Christmas Carol"" a little. There's just too much going on, too many subplots and characters, too many diversions and sidetracks and it makes the film feel long.I didn't hate it, but nor am I going to start watching it every Christmas."

Many recognisable, funny, relatable actors make this enjoyable. The Night Before spends a good amount of time on funny moments and also family or relationship moments, like Hangover movies. Story progression feels very like 21 Jump Street, another successful comedy. Christmas theme makes it different.Improvement Area:
Ideas are not very original, all similar to other Seth Rogan movies. Maybe we do not need this movie, lots of money spent but does not tell a new story.Yes this is a funny movie but also forgettable. Actors make it worthwhile. 6 stars."

",0.5106,0.996,2020-04-15 00:00:00,9,"Ridiculously fun and entertaining, The Night Before may not land all the time, but is certainly one hilarious Christmas comedy that deserves seeing. The performances are great, Joseph Gordon Levitt most of all- and the main 3 (Mackie, Levitt, and Rogen) make for a great trio that is endlessly entertaining when they are together. This brings me to the films most crucial flaw- which is its tonal changes when the 3 are separate. It feels like film wants us to care about Levitt's character, and we do, but it's so hard to watch, and becomes frustratingly harsh to a point and simply breaks out of the fun mold it tried so hard to put intact in the first place. That being said, the film has plenty to offer otherwise. The tone may not be steady, but the jokes all throughout the film remain equally hilarious, and the situations so as well. In the end, The Night Before is not a great film, but a mighty fun time, with just enough energy, magic and laughs to earn its spot as a future Christmas comedy classic.
My Rating: 8.75/10"
" Great festive comedy

My wife and I found this movie to be laugh out loud hilarious! I really didn't think that this would be her kind of movie but she loved it. It really seems like a Judd Apatow film.

" Hilarious with the Right Amount of Christmas.
",0.4019,0.9981,2019-12-18 00:00:00,9,"Review:
'The Night Before' is a Christmas stoner-comedy film directed by Jonathan Levine.
This film has been on my radar for a long time now, I just never got around to sitting down and putting it on around Christmas time because there are so many other movies to watch. After viewing it I was very happy with how the story was executed and the three leads were great together.
The film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie as three childhood friends who annually reunite on Christmas Eve in search of the best party in New York City.
The three leads in the movie not only need to be funny, but also need to have the right amount of chemistry, and they certainly do. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was making me laugh in the very first seconds as an elf in an hotel. Seth Rogen is maybe at his best he has in a while, yes, he is the stoner again, but his character also has a something new, becoming a dad. Anthony Mackie is good as usual, but he may be the underrated one here. He really shows his comedic skills without being too cocky even if his character stays the most human most of the time.
There may be a lot in this movie that can be offensive. There are jokes about sexuality, male body parts, sexting, and a baby acting like an adult, as well as friendships between Christians and Jews and the clash of cultures between their religions during the holiday season. I think the movie pulled off these jokes well. Instead of it feeling like they were making fun of a certain group of people, it felt like they were making fun of themselves.
Overall, the movie could go down as a Holiday film to watch annually. It has plenty of laughs as well as being packed full of Christmas traditions that different people celebrate.

" Fear and Loathing before Christmas
",-0.7845,0.9927,2019-12-16 00:00:00,6,"""The Night Before"" is a 2015 Christmas comedy directed by Jonathan Levine starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie. After having watched this flick I'm slowly beginning to question Rogen's talent as an actor, as he (again!) played himself in here. Or is it just a coincidence that he's always portraying a loveable and awkward Jewish stoner with strong deep bond to his childhood friends who's overwhelmed by his life? We'll never know. Despite the sympathic leading trio, the film immediately gives away it's cheap nature. More than the first half contains scenes that aren't either funny nor did they make me laugh. It's too fast, too stupid and way too overwrought. All of this is extremely cringe and I was covering my eyes in shame, because of how unfunny some situations were. The only redeeming feature in this disaster was Michael Shannon's performance of the dubious Mr. Green who turns out to be more than just a simple drug dealer. Despite the mess the screenplay is, he impressed me with how he gave his silly character so much depth. Next to both ingenious and idiotic references to countless holiday classic films there's nothing notable that made me giggle. I was tremendously confused of what the story tried to be. From the beginning, it didn't hit a good tone and changed it several times. Was it hilarious? Was it satirical? Was it childish? Yes, all of them, in a totally messy way. Goldberg and Rogen again tried to live out their most childish fantasies on the big screen, but this time it simply made me facepalm countless times. Most of this was uncomfortably cringe I hoped would be over soon. Even cameos of the usual suspects of the Rogen bunch couldn't quite make it a better film, only in the final act it finally managed to make tracks. In this segment they finally dealt with the most important values I wish they have thematized before: emotions, friendship, love and the true meaning of the Christmas spirit. Those final moments even touched me on a deep level, because they showed what all is really about. All in all, this mess is a film one could probably only enjoy on a excessive drug trip. It's a mediocre and disastrous flick with severe problems, but with one great performance and an enjoyable ending. If you're bored with all the perfect classics, go watch this and you'll be reminded of how much you actually love them. The general score isn't as high the protagonists are - deservedly."

Certain storylines I didn't see the point in and could have done without being there. Same with certain characters also.
It just felt really loose and didn't really have too much depth. Like, the film is based on them getting to this party and yet it barely plays a part in the overall scheme of things.But yeah.

The first minute seemed promising, but it seems the entire film fell apart scene after scene. The humour was neither smart nor funny (taking drugs alone does not make great comedy), the overplayed black character speaking about weed all the time was annoying, and the film started to completely drag with embarassingly unfunny scenes like that karaoke bar singing. Did they intend this to be a musical gone bad? Had to turn it off after 10 minutes or so as not really any plot was developing and the artificial acting was unbearable."

thought it was funny, nothing over the top, or overbearing. I liked the way their
friendship was highlighted, they seemed really close; and all three had great chemistry together. Anthony Mackie was really interesting, I don't recall seeing
him in this kind of roles before, so it made the dynamic far more interesting.As far as the story goes, I particularly liked how making it to that Christmas party was sort of like a quest, an exciting adventure. It had great cameos and it
wrapped up nicely too. Not a masterpiece by any means, but enjoyable from the cosiness of your own home."

Basically in December 2001, Ethan Miller (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) lost his parents in a car accident, his best friends Isaac Greenberg (Seth Rogen) and Chris Roberts (Anthony Mackie) resolve to spend every Christmas Eve with him, this becomes a yearly tradition. In 2015, the three friends must face up to their various responsibilities, Chris is a famous football player, Isaac is married with a baby on the way, and Ethan is a struggling musician, it means the end of their tradition. Ethan has found and stolen tickets to the Nutcracker Ball, a tremendous, invite-only Christmas Eve party they have wanted to go to for years, Isaac's wife Betsy (Jillian Bell) gives him drugs to use during the evening. The friends do the usual tradition, going from place to place, with the intention to go to the party afterward. They start at the Rockefeller Tree, where Ethan reveals the tickets to the ball, and Chris buys marijuana from their former high school dealer, Mr. Green (Michael Shannon), Chris smokes some of this weed. While a karaoke bar, the friends bump into Diana (Lizzy Caplan), who recently broke up with Ethan for refusing to commit, and Diana's friend Sarah (Mindy Kaling), the friends learn the two ladies will be at the ball as well. While at the bar, Isaac has negative affects to the drugs he took, resulting him making a video phone message admitting he is terrified of having a child, and Chris also has his marijuana stolen. Wanting more marijuana, Mr. Green meets them at the house of Mrs. Roberts, Chris's mother (Lorraine Toussaint), Isaac smokes a special weed, which shows him the future where his daughter is a stripper, and his wife blames him for it. The friends end up having dinner, cooked by Mrs. Roberts, who encourages Ethan to make up with Diana, and Isaac realises that he accidentally switched phones with Sarah. The three friends split up, as Chris wants more marijuana, Isaac wants his phone, and Ethan wants to go to the party. Ethan, Isaac and Chris meet again back at a subway station, where the tension between the friends explodes. Despite making revelations to each other, the three friends still go to the Nutcracker Ball, there Chris is teased about the video he made earlier, Isaac gets his phone back, and Ethan finds Diana. Ethan is amazed to meet singer Miley Cyrus at the bar, he knows Diana loves her song ""Wrecking Ball"", Miley suggests she sings it and he comes onstage with her to make a public proposal. Diana publicly accepts the proposal, but privately declines, saying she only said yes because she was put on the spot, she thinks the reason he proposed is because he fears losing his friends. Mr. Green reveals that he created and has hosted the Nutcracker Ball since its inception, he takes marijuana with Ethan, who experiences a memory of his friends initiating their yearly ritual. Ethan joins his friends, who are thrown after arguing with partygoers, the friends reconcile by the morning, just as Betsy is going into labour, Mr. Green rushes them to the hospital, but it turns out to be a false alarm. Mr. Green is also revealed to be an angel, who has been helping the friends to earn his wings. The trio spend Christmas at Isaac's house, after which Chris admits to his mother doing steroids, Ethan goes to Diana's house and apologises to Diana, she accepts his request to meet her parents. One year later, the friends and their loved ones spend Christmas together, it ends showing that the story was being told by Santa Claus (Tracy Morgan, also narrating), who is the father of Mr. Green. Also starring Heléne Yorke as Cindy, Ilana Glazer as Rebecca Grinch and Aaron Hill as Tommy Owens. Rogen is a force of nature as the high father-to-be, Gordon-Levitt is good as the partially sensible one, and Mackie is also likeable, this might not become a Christmas classic, it is just a series of drug and sex filled misadventures covered in tinsel, but I cannot deny I found myself laughing at the gross and slapstick moments, a fun seasonal comedy. Worth watching!"

" The Night Before
",0.0,0.9881,2018-12-21 00:00:00,5,"I admit seeing Seth Rogan on constant drug craze during Christmas Eve as Anthony Mackie (Captain America: Winter Soldier) is searching for the thief gal who stole the weed he bought off of enigmatic and intensely silent brooding pot-dealer Michael Shannon while Gordon-Levitt (who I like in almost anything) pursues the former girlfriend he just couldn't commit to, always finding excuses, isn't particularly of my own personal interest. If you love Rogan on overdrive (he is ""allowed"" by his pregnant wife the chance to ""indulge"" after ordering a box of various drugs ""off Craigslist""!), unleashing a fearful tirade about how unready and unprepared he is to be a father or puking his guts out in a Catholic church (while wearing his specially made Jewish sweater...there's a whole bag of jokes on this in the film) while freaking out at a child wicked-smiling at him then this is for you. And, yes, Franco makes an appearance as Mindy Kaling's phone (there's an accidental phone swap between Rogan and Mindy in a karaoke bar when the gorgeous Lizzy Caplan and Gordon-Levitt reunite after a breakup due to a lack of commitment) has dick pics Rogan receives embarrassingly. Mackie is an aging baseball star hoping to impress ""The Messiah"", a major league player currently at the ""big NYC party"" known as the Nutcracker Ball (Miley Cyrus is the musical act, later contributing to a big proposal with Gordon-Levitt even singing alongside her!). Gordon-Levitt lost his parents in 2001 and Rogan and Mackie were the friends who eventually serve as his surrogate family. The loss of his parents and loneliness obviously contribute to Gordon-Levitt's own inner battles to truly commit to Caplan, always coming up with excuses, too afraid that eventual marriage and family will threaten his symbiosis with his two pals. But Rogan already has a wife and eventual son while Mackie is connected to success in baseball so Gordon-Levitt soon realizes that Caplan isn't someone he should continue to keep at a distance. Shannon's dealer-with the kind of dope that can send you into the future and past to experience situations that awaken existential thoughts and feelings, even with emerging wings and copping to being the secret Nutcracker Ball's ""Great Gatsby""-steals the film. Gordon-Levitt's sincere performance, even as Rogan goes full tilt boogie and Mackie remains invested in catching Ilana Glazer's weed thief (who Home Alone's Mackie with micro machines before pulling a Hans Gruber fall from a building into a dumpster to get away), is an anchor I appreciated. Honestly, this film overall didn't light my fire. It is one of those ""night in the life of..."" films where three friends have adventures in the city during Christmas Eve but I'm not much of a dopehead comedy fan myself."

One of the characters goes on a drug trip, which I think was supposed to be something along the lines of The Hangover but instead fell flat and just seemed to go on forever.All the characters were given self reflecting quests to go on to ""figure out"" who they were and what they really wanted from life, at least thats what this turns into. But instead of being a hilarious romp it was kind of a slow, almost sad and very forgettable movie. I really wanted to like this movie as I liked all the actors in it and thought they all did a pretty good job with what they had to work with.If this was supposed to be a drama there wasn't much going on there. It was super predictable and boring. This is the type of movie I like to throw on during the winter season when it's cold and snowy outside, curl up in my big comfy chair and have a nap while it plays in the background - guaranteed that no matter where I wake up during the movie I won't have missed a thing."

",0.0,0.9042,2018-06-09 00:00:00,5,"""The Night Before"" turned out to be an adequate comedy, and it managed to live up to whatever expectations that I had to it.This is in, all honesty, a very generic comedy that uses a formula that has been used countless of times in other similar comedies, so don't expect anything new or innovating here.The cast was actually the best part of the movie, and I must admit that despite the fact that I am not much of a fan of Seth Rogen in any way, then he was actually the one who stood out the most in the movie because of the drug scenes, which were also the highlights of the entire movie. And Mindy Kaling were also standing out with her performance, just a shame that she had limited time on the screen. There were also some nice cameo performances by the likes of James Franco, Miley Cyrus and Tracy Morgan. And it definitely was a shame that James Franco didn't have more on-screen time, because he was hilarious here.""The Night Before"" is a very run-of-the-mill comedy. So it is good enough for a single viewing, but it hardly has enough contents to become a Christmas classic."
" Picaresque Fantasy

Forget the basic plot - the dialogue and characters are what make this movie different. One scene that is hard to forget though is the punch-up with the Santa Clauses. This violent scene is shocking and spoils the spirit of the movie. Joseph Gordon- Levitt physically resembles the great Heath Ledger more and more. Best line: ""Friends come and go but fans last forever.""!"
" The Night Before follows the current tradition of a Christmas party comedy, except this one is just as bland as the others.
",0.6369,0.9883,2018-02-27 00:00:00,5,"Really? Why? Why must we have these every year? We've seen one, therefore we've seen them all. This time around we follow three best friends as they party on the night before Christmas. That is it. There is no more context. Sure some weed is stolen, phones are swapped and a karaoke session is performed...but it's just a party. Christmas is a time of reflection. It is a holiday to be spent with loved ones, cherishing all the little idiosyncrasies that friends and family share. But apparently in Hollywood, Christmas is about snorting cocaine, consuming shrooms and fulfilling a joyous night with plenty of regret. However, before you discard me as the local Grinch, I did find this watchable. The narrative does include your typical comedic structure. Main characters have fun, something happens, they fight, they make up. But it's executed in a way where it feels, dare I say, intelligent? No no, I take that back. Let's face it, the cameos and film references is what makes this work. James Franco flirting with Seth Rogen's character is somewhat humorous. Who can top that? Miley Cyrus. You bring in the 'good girl gone bad' popstar to sing ""Wrecking Ball"". That's how you do it. I actually found her funny. *sigh*...what's wrong with me? The cast was somewhat interesting. Seth Rogen having the most experience steals the limelight, Anthony Mackie and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were just there as a side show. And why oh why oh why is Michael Shannon in this? Why? He's better than this (although he played his role with conviction). The countless film references were horrendous. Die Hard, Home Alone, Big and even The Great Gatsby. Sure this comedy felt Christmassy, but it's just another generic party-a-thon. I feel like I've questioned myself as a film reviewer, why do I put myself through these when I know I won't like them? I guess it's that small glimmer of hope that it might actually break tradition and be memorable. Nope, this isn't it."

His friends Isaac (Seth Rogen) and Chris (Anthony Mackie) become his new Christmas bar buddies from this time forward. They hear about the ultimate Christmas party known as the Nutcracker, a private affair they can't locate. It appears this is going to be their last Christmas together. Isaac has a wife who is very expecting while Chris has gone on to be a famous Football player...one that doesn't have to practice over Christmas. Ethan comes across and steals tickets for the ultimate party, a party where they must face the realities of their life...in order to give a stoner film some meaning.The film did have some colorful characters which made a formula stoner film digestible. Mr Green (Michael Shannon) the drug dealer and ghost of Christmas past, present, and future was somebody we have all met. Rebecca Grinch (Ilana Glazer) was another favorite of mine. It is nice to see Tracy Morgan is alive, but in all honesty Samuel L. Jackson giving a salty reading would have been far better. Potty mouth Miley Cyrus did a fair job playing herself. The conversation between James Franco and Seth Rogen was funny on a different level considering the number of movies they have done together. This is a 30 something stoner film. My main criticism is Seth Rogen acting on drugs dragged on way too long to a point I was feeling nauseated too.I liked the film with apologies to Charles Dickens.Guide: F-words, brief sex, brief stripper nudity, and James Franco's manhood on a phone. Sex talk. While there were a lot of crude elements in this feature, I thought they were funny within their own right and not done just for the sake of being crude...mostly."

This is almost more of a drug film than a Christmas movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing - or a good thing. Simple concept - Ethan (Gordon-Levitt)'s parents died when he was 18, so his two best friends, Isaac & Chris (Mackie) have a Christmas Eve tradition where they go drinking in New York.From there, it's easy - people grow up & grow apart, so this is their farewell to the tradition. Drugs are taken, ridiculous situations ensue. Rogen didn't write this, but there's still plenty of jokes for him and his drug-addled self, even if he is playing the ""responsible Dad"" from Neighbours', just with the night off. Lizzy Caplan needed more screen time and backstory, but it's good to see Michael Shannon, Tracy Morgan & James Franco pop up.A few great laugh out loud moments, particularly in the Midnight Mass scene, and some other chuckles throughout, but there's not enough sustained hilarity, or heartfelt moments, even if the film gets there at the end. Not the worst Christmas film, but nor is it 'Bad Santa'."
" Some hits and misses
",-0.2263,0.9799,2017-12-28 00:00:00,6,"The Night Before seemed to have came and went when released during the holidays in 2015. Not much of advertised was for this film and some of the trailers were misleading. Nowadays having rarely many R- rated Christmas films, this was certainly going to be a flop, and it was and is somewhat forgotten. To the film, the comedy involves around the chemistry of its leads, which were good but the overall gags and jokes were many misses. Some decent laughs but overall many of the jokes felt forced and weren't that funny or clever. The Night Before starts off slow then gets better and more consistent after midway through (around the big party scene with Hollywood cameos). Although predictable, in the end the film does show its softer side as it comes together and proves how good friendship and loyalty are towards everything."

Ethan finds 3 tickets to a party and along the way they encounter a mysterious man, Mr. Green (Shannon) who puts their lives in a magical yet whacky perspective. James Franco, Miley Cyrus and Tracy Morgan also appear. This is a good comedy with humorous and bizarre moments with a great cast. I recommend this."
" Better than the average wild R-rated Christmas comedy - it has a soul
",0.6597,0.9979,2017-12-22 00:00:00,7,"If cinema in the 21st century has failed in any one regard, it's delivering new classic Christmas movies. Sure, there's a point to be made that great Christmas movies are older movies because they should evoke nostalgia, but nostalgia is relative. ""The Night Before"" won't be recognized as a new classic, but in the era of raunchier, R-rated Christmas films we somehow find ourselves in, at least it evokes the ""spirit of Christmas"" without falling all over itself.Like every great Christmas creation, ""The Night Before"" is of course made by Jews. Jonathan Levine, who previously brought Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen together to make the severely underrated cancer comedy ""50/50,"" gets credited with the story and the screenplay (co-written with Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir and Evan Goldberg). The reason this makes sense is because only a Jewish person would have experience with Christmas Eve debauchery, seeing as everyone else is spending time with family.So it makes sense that the story follows a 30-something bachelor in Ethan (Gordon-Levitt) who loves Christmas but who lost his parents as a teenager and therefore has nowhere to go. His friends Isaac and Chris' (Rogen and Anthony Mackie) effort to spend time with him therefore morphed into a Christmas Eve tradition with a mix of activities from PG to Hard R. Only now, Isaac is about to be a dad and Chris is a star football player, so their tradition (and relationships) are at a crossroads. ""The Night Before"" is as much about sorting through the stark realities of being in one's thirties as it is about being a Christmas stoner comedy and that's where Levine excels. His films have always marketed as comedy but remain invested in actual human issues. And that's not saying that the script haphazardly throws in feel-good Christmas themes or wedges in other values; he actually commits screen time to those themes and values and they go deeper than the self-evident, surface level.All that being as it may, ""The Night Before"" cares foremost about its commitment to being a comedy. What separates it from other films that have attempted the same is the writing and the cast. Most of these ""epic night out"" movies force and fabricate the most outlandish comedic situations imaginable and end up losing sight of reality. And while Michael Shannon playing a weed dealer with abilities out of ""A Christmas Carol"" can't exactly claim to be in touch, a talent like Shannon understands exactly how to play that kind of scene to underscore the value of him being there aside from being a hilarious cameo.Another good example: all these movies have trippy drug scenes. The difference with ""The Night Before"" is that going nuts on drugs is written into Rogen's character. His pregnant wife gifts him a mystery box of substances as a pre-fatherhood ""thank you"" and the line between recreational use and trying to feel better about his underlying fears is the essence of his character arc. Him going crazy therefore isn't condensed into one wild situational comedy sequence. ""The Night Before"" could easily be reduced to a dumb Christmas-themed guys' night out stoner comedy, or it could be looked at more closely as a film about aging out of that stuff through the lens of Christmas spirit. It works on both those levels, and that's kind of a nice gift. If it had more originality to it, it would probably rise above its above-average comedy status into something more memorable, but in the crowd of Christmas movies that tried to do the same thing, it stands a bit taller.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" A nice movie to watch for people feeling upset on the Holidays.
",0.5106,0.955,2017-12-20 00:00:00,7,"This is probably one of my favorite holiday movies of all time. I watch it every Christmas, especially when I'm not feeling the happiest. It's such a nice movie to watch when your feeling upset. It's such a colorful and happy movie, it's also very lighthearted. There couldn't be a better main cast than Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anthony Mackie, and Seth Rogen. It's definitely a really fun movie and a really good one to watch for the older and stressed out people on the Holidays. And, if not the Holidays, then that's what ""Neighbors"" is for."

" Where are the jokes?
",0.25,0.9667,2017-11-21 00:00:00,4,"I'll start by saying that I've been a long time fan of Seth Rogan, even through some of his (supposed) 'misfires' such as 'The Green Hornet,' therefore I was quite surprised that 'The Night Before' sneaked by my consciousness and popped up to view on an online streaming services. I read the blurb about three old friends going out just before Christmas for one last big party before they all have to carry on with their adult lives and figured it would be worth an hour and a half of my time. It wasn't.Since watching it I've read a number of reviews, many bashing it for its 'glamourising drugs,' one viewer going as far as to say that 'the drugs were almost like a character in themselves.' However, that didn't bother me so much as the fact that I just didn't laugh. Most comedies fail to make you split your sides with laughter, but you should at least get a few chuckles and wry smiles out of a known comic actor's offering. I just didn't. There were simply no jokes. There was a lot of shouting and a few gross scenes, plus a fair amount of swearing (again, swearing bothers me about as much as drug-use, but it needs to be incorporated into the jokes, rather than just to fit as many four-letter words in as possible). There are undertones of likening the story to a modern retelling of 'A Christmas Carol,' therefore expect the odd (borderline) supernatural experience to be thrown in there. I don't know whether it was supposed to be really supernatural, or just brought on by the drugs, but it wasn't necessary to what little plot there was and it certainly wasn't as clever as it was supposed to be.I wouldn't even call the humour 'crude,' simply because there wasn't any humour on display. The three central characters just bumble from one drunken/drug-induced (supposedly comedic) set-piece to the next as they go around town. If they were likable you may actually care about their lives and the problems they're (sort of) trying to escape from (namely growing up), but you don't. They come across as the sort of 'bros' you don't wanna know.I still like Seth Rogan and will look on this as the first of his 'misfires' that actually misfired with me."

" Comedy as it should be

Yet, I will now reiterate myself and watch ""The Night Before"" countless times in addition to exploring comedies with the various cast from ""TNB"". Seth Rogen in his PRIME, the movie would not have been a movie without Rogen. Damn phenomenal performance."
" Funny, but missing the heart of an Apatow comedy
",0.34,0.98,2017-09-09 00:00:00,6,"Entertaining if forgettable Christmas stoner comedy. Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie go out on Christmas Eve for one last hurrah with their friend Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who they have all gone out together since the death of Gordon-Levitt's family, one last time before they all basically become responsible adults. It's a rather morose set- up for a light and often crass comedy. Judd Apatow was not a part of this film, and ""The Night Before"" is missing the heart and emotional resonance that Apatow typically brings to comedies he produces (yes, I'll make the case for even the goofy ones like ""Anchorman 2"" and ""Pee-wee's Big Holiday"" having heart). I think that's my main complaint about the film. The dramatic elements are rather maudlin and do not come off as all that sincere or genuine. Still, the comedy is pretty darn funny and that's more than enough to carry this film and make it worth watching. It also doesn't hurt that the film features a very funny supporting cast that includes Lizzy Caplan, Jillian Bell, Mindy Kaling, Tracy Morgan, James Franco, and even Miley Cyrus. Michael Shannon gets a special shout out for his part as the thoughtful drug dealer Mr. Green. Overall, this film isn't a comedy classic, but it's funny and will hold your interest while you watch it, even if you'll c completely forget about it two hours later."
