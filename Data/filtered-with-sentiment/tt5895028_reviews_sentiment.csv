" Enjoyed until race baiting at the end..
",0.5106,0.4337,2021-03-12 00:00:00,2,"The documentary was good until the segment with Trump. Then it turned gross and typical how they took his words, then put them in context with images from days of Jim C and make it seem like this is what he was referring to when it couldn't be further from the truth...after seeing that I couldn't take any of what I watched serious. And this is why mainstream media and liberal hollywood is dying, can't be trusted.. if your on the line or simply agreeing with liberal ideas because you believe what you hear and read. Please look into it because the left has been holding down minorities for years, and don't want them to be looked at as equals. They want them to be held tightly in place and needing to rely on government so they can manipulate them and there votes.. It's not hard to find the truth nowadays.. Simple start around Jim C times and move forward. There's no reason to be ignorant to what they preach today with all the information we have at our fingertips.... And trust me I'm not cheerleading for the Right, I think they're both crooked and gross."

Racism is a reality in our world and it's important that we have data coming to us through accessible language and different perspectives, and this film does the trick, the interviews show different sides on the issue and presents statistical data to make its point as it ties well the topic of institutional racism with the topic of incarceration and the Black Lives Matter movement. It's no wonder it won so many awards."
" i've seen this a million times
",0.0,0.4444,2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,"I have literally seen this at least 5 times, probably more, because it gets assigned frequently in high school/college. That being said, I think this documentary is completely appropriate and useful for high school and anyone who has no exposure to the criminal legal system in the United States. However, it is unfinished. By that I mean they present a lot of information about the history of incarceration and the structures currently in place, but there is really not much in the way of solution/how to oppose these structures. I attended a talk by Angela Davis, who is interviewed in this documentary, and she said herself that they left out her more radical comments on the subject. I would recommend it for those who haven't thought yet about the deeply systemic nature of racism, because it gives a really strong overview and introduction to the subject."

With the rise of the KKK instilling fear into the black community for 60 years post 1915. This is all within the last 60 years and counting of America's history and we are still talking about law and order. I admit the documentary never showed the other side of the story and almost never admitted that any of the black people arrested were in gangs instead of trying to get educated etc. But the brutal crackdown on soft drugs in the form of cocaine and the slavery they installed inside the prisons by making them private and trying to get as many people as possible in there. To give you some perspective they said 1/3 Black men will spend time behind bars in their lifetime this is a massive issue still going on 4 years later check it out."
" Big Youth Headlines: 6 Dead & 19 Gone To Jail
",-0.6486,-0.9761,2020-10-02 00:00:00,10,"Most documentaries are loaded with bias. This is no different. The bias is that the documentary tries to prove that a large percentage of Black Males are incarcerated in comparison to the rest of the population. My argument is that when it comes to slavery, it's a 'class war' not a racial thing.President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863 declared that the enslaved in Confederate-controlled areas were free.The Thirteenth Amendment (Amendment XIII) to the United States Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, 'Except As Punishment For A Crime'. This is where the documentary picks up and the story begins.The US Constitution provided a broad & very generous loophole in the law - a loophole that is open to all manner of interpretations - ie: if the vast majority of Black Males are criminalised & subsequently punished for their major or minor crimes they cannot or have no rights to wave the 13th Amendment & proclaim 'freedom'. In other words if a Black person doesn't say a perky 'Have A Good Day' to his neighbour, it can be made a criminal offence.It's only an eye opener to the young & unconscious who before now ignored that it is 'the law' that permits peoples as well as institutions & organisations to put padlocks on 'freedom', in order to harness the nation & control the masses."

",-0.7003,-0.98,2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"This was a horror movie hidden under the disguise of a documentary. This documentary basically opened my eyes to the fact that slavery is still not gone in America. If you're a prisoner, you're basically a slave to the nation, and there's nothing you can do about it. With interviews from numerous professors and journalists of all races and genders, including Angela Davis (that's pretty cool), we learn more about the monstrosities that went on in the 20th century - present. Also, I learned more about Fred Hampton. He was only 21, and he was uniting people with the Black Panthers. 21! Makes me even more excited to see Judas and the Black Messiah in 2021. I also had to see many innocent African Americans be killed by the hands of the police. It's very scary, especially because all people could do was stand and watch, not wanting to be arrested or worse themselves. It's terrible, and it happened everyday, and then these people get off with a slap on the wrist. Disgusting."

" Mandatory viewing

If a person were to be declared a criminal, they would spend live incarcerated and would be treated like a slave.This begins with exploring the cinematic connection of glorifying KKK in the _Birth of a Nation_, in 1915. This film led to KKK's ritual of burning crosses. This started fortifying the connection between Blacks and criminality. Then, it moves in to laws such as Jim Crow, which promoted segregation based upon races and enforced racism, legally.This shows how both the political parties have been, well, a party to the criminalization of Blacks, with Nixon , Reagan etc who started mass incarceration under war on drugs to Bill Clinton with his _3 strikes, mandatory minimum_ etc. And then, the last 30-40 minutes are dedicated to the prison government complex (prison management, with its 100s of millions of dollars worth of food, health and phone calls happens to be one profitable private sector enterprise) with organizations such as the little known ALEC, who help write laws that are then passed on by politicians, who end up benefitting the organizations supporting ALEC and various bail organizations.It is hard hitting, gut wrenching and mind blowing and is made in such an engaging manner that all of such complex and new info can be absorbed easily in one viewing.Mandatory watch, to understand why movements such as Black Lives Matter are so important.

In it we have the people who often have nothing to offer the world picking on the most vulnerable of our society. So they can feel ""good"" about themselves. If I had one thing reinforced, it is a world where a race of people allowed a part of America (the South) the ability to flourish without any benefits to these poor souls. This story needs to be told. And stop that ""race card"" crap. The anger over the race card means nothing to anyone but racists. This is not a perfect film, but it showed how pervasive this discrimination is. And finally, those poor MAGA people that are being attacked. How many Trump allies had rubber bullets fired at them? How many were confronted by the National Guard?"

Instead, the majority of the film content turned out to be repeated 5-15 second snippets of interviews in which interviewees present opinions on historical events. The snippets of historical media clips that intertwined these are interesting but they were not joined together well or explored in-depth. The repeated, very brief clips of interviewees' views resulted in losing interest and giving up on the film."
" I Am No Longer Accepting the Things I Can Not Change. I Am Changing the Things I Can Not Accept...
",0.1027,-0.9538,2020-06-18 00:00:00,8,"PROS:
~13th starts in a smart way and goes back to the era of slavery pointing out that racial inequalities weren't completely eradicated but relived through different ways until the Civil Right Movement. After the Civil War people of color were presented as murderers or rapists of white women. The reference to the movie ''Birth of Nation'' is on point and the romanticization of KKK is unconceivable to think that existed. Furthermore, the arrest of people of color for labor purposes and the degredation of them into second-class status (Jim Crow laws) are clear examples of their oppression, just with a different approach.
~The racial discriminations, however, were maintained even after the Civil Right Movement. The film depicts perfectly the different ways the governments found in order to lead people of color into prison without causing reactions about the racial inequalities. The biggest example was the laws that were made to deal with the drug plague. It's shocking to learn that the sentence for a crack cocaine possession wasn't the same with the one about powder cocaine, a situation that was harmful only for black people. As a result of these tactics, the incarcerations and the number of people in the prisons were increased, enhancing a general feeling that minorities were subordinate human beings.
~The documentary explores the growth industry of prisons and why this condition benefits some groups like CCA (Corrections Corporation of America). It's unbelievable that the criminalization of minor activities was intentional so specific businessmen could profit from the prison labor or the fact that a certain organization of private sector representatives (ALEC) could draft legislation.
~As expected, the media play a significant role for the social inequities against black people using catchy phrases to highlight their crimes. Moreover, police brutality shows that many fights should be given by minorities in order to have a better future. This documentary is a must see film for educational purposes considering the tragic events people of color relive over and over again.
~The songs that are used intermittently are effective enough and the illustration of some words with a bigger font help to highlight some themes. Ava DuVernay chooses clever ways via montages to adress that these problems exist even in the today's society showing the resemblances between the past and now. The interviews of important personalities and activists add more authedicity to the documentary.CONS:
~The film sometimes plays safely and omits to adress why people of minorities are often led to crime. I believe that it avoids this situation in order not to be misuranderstood or demonised but this is wrong for me. It is known that the biotic level of minorities is inferior to the one of white people. As a result poverty can be a reason for commiting a crime making this action justifiable. In other words, the film could have mentioned that commiting a crime has nothing to do with the race.
~The movie often lacks a more coherent narrative structure considering that the prison system is the one that the film should have focused more. To my point of view, it could have included stories from real prisoners and their experiences.P.S. The conversation between Ava and Oprah is an interesting companion to this documentary."
" 13th
",0.0,-0.8955,2020-06-18 00:00:00,7,"De Vernay's biting expose of the US Penal system and how the 13th amendment which did away with slavery, in practice allows it to continue to be used where punishment for crime applies and how this is in turn used in a clearly racist way.The documentary uses stock footage and talking heads to initially walk through successive presidents who seem to make things worse one at a time, generally motivated by the need for strong on crime election promises irrespective of the consequences. Thereafter the focus tightens on America's financial need to keep prisons full for inmates to support the economy ie quasi slave labour and then into the appalling police brutality.Fascinating, shocking stuff that often makes the blood boil and sit back in amazement that this di called developed country can treat people like this. The film should be watched by all as it id certainly an eye opener reflecting very badly on the USA and its continuation of myriad racist agendas."
" Slavery, Jim Crow, to Mass Incarceration
",-0.7003,-0.9698,2020-06-16 00:00:00,7,"I have no doubt a documentary such as ""13th"" has a positive effect on the real world, perhaps educating some and contributing to debates that lead to such legislation as the prison reform bill passed subsequent to its release. Its thesis is clear: that slavery and Jim Crow have been continued in America by mass incarceration, including disproportionately of black men, whereby cheap labor is exploited, voting rights disenfranchised and racial minorities segregated and labelled negatively as ""criminal,"" ""super predator,"" and such--all through the slavery loophole of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which otherwise supposedly ended slavery in the U.S. Some of the editing of clips is effective, too. The matching of images of racial animus during the civil rights movement to words from now-President Donald Trump and the violent actions from some of his supporters at his political rallies works better, I think, than similar historical crosscutting in Spike Lee's later ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018).But, ""13th"" is also largely comprised of the usual talking heads, which is one thing when they're academics, legal experts or some other intelligent observer of or participant in the history of race, but I can do without politicians the likes of Charlie Rangel and Newt Gingrich offering half-hearted apologies for the legislation they passed that exacerbated the problem, let alone interviews from hacks like a propagandist for the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). The result is that ""13th"" appears too much like something cable news would produce, with a top-down approach heavily focused on presidential politics--oddly the opposite of the ground-up view from the same director's ""Selma"" (2014). Seems to me that something such as discussing former President Bill Clinton apologizing to the NAACP regarding his Crime Bill, but subsequently getting into some shouting match with ""Black Lives Matter"" protesters could be cut.Compare this to ""I Am Not Your Negro"" (2016), also nominated for the Best Documentary Oscar that year; that picture, based on an unfinished manuscript by James Baldwin, starts with the individual and their relationship with racism in the nation, from which the argument transitions to cultural artifacts, such as motion pictures, that influence and reflect societal biases. ""13th"" mentions the racist epic ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915), then moves on to lengthy regurgitations on the politics of presidents from Nixon to Trump. It would bolster, too, the movie's still-stinging concluding comment by Bryan Stevenson (the lawyer portrayed by Michael B. Jordan in ""Just Mercy"" (2019), by the way), which does turn the focus back on us, the individual and society at large, as he cites the hypocrisy of asserting one's superiority to past atrocities when, today, we continue to tolerate new forms of slavery, lynching and segregation."

Media spread the black's stereotype and made people blame individuals.The songs used intermittently are Hip hop and the lyrics show black's suffering from racism, with trendy beat and sounds. And it makes me feel ironic, I never have thought about their historical background although I usually enjoy hip-hop. The trendiness of songs is the evidence of the fact that black's problem is occurring in very recent days.Regardless of controversy whether it is the well-made doc, the problem exists, and this content at least helps people over the world to perceive the problem.

This is a large scope for a documentary and I applaud Ava DuVernay for maintaining a clear, concise and comprehensive overview that never drags or diminishes in meaning or the overarching thesis. Neither does she run down any rabbit holes or ruminates on a single subtopic, as tempting as it might be. It's an ideal introduction, but more importantly, it clarifies that this is nothing new, but the continuation of centuries of oppression. It may look different, and smell different, and talk different, but it's still the same. And as relevant as ever.

",0.0,-0.9945,2020-04-21 00:00:00,2,"I understand and agree that our prison system is in need a major overhaul. Having a for-profit system is just ludicrous to me. There have been countless legal proceedings related to corruption and embezzlement and much more in regards to those who run various prisons throughout the country. It's terrible. However, this film is not focused on this side of things as much. As many others here have said, this film seems to sometimes be a bit inaccurate with it's information and other times seems to be intentionally misleading the audience. Figures are overblown and inflated in order to paint a much different narrative. It looks more like armageddon through the filmmaker's lens.I wish I didn't have to say this but I'm probably going to get people assuming I'm some sort of racist just because I didn't like this movie. It used to be only a thing if you were plainly obviously that way but anymore people say that at the drop of a hat. I'm a realist. I take things at face value and logic dictates my thought process in everything. The film throws all sorts of horrible sounding statistics and then interjects them into concepts about systemic racism and slavery and basically saying that prison is just another version of slavery. This is 100% inaccurate. While there definitely are some abuses in our criminal justice system, to outright say that slavery never ended is dangerously ignorant. It's specifically misleading also. This is where my huge problem with this movie lies. It's propaganda behind a smokescreen of largely inaccurate statistics and manipulative editing. The filmmaker clearly wants you to become very emotional watching this. I understand that emotions are definitely part of this conversation but don't use emotionally manipulative techniques and editing and lies to paint a narrative that isn't true.What would have been much more effective is for the filmmaker to focus more on prison reform. Instead of essentially saying that every black prisoner is in there by absolutely zero effort on their own part. This is absurd. We should have focused on the ones that we know are there and shouldn't be. Using actual facts and cases that are not manipulated to look more substantial. I have no doubt that there would have been enough information to fill the entire length of the movie. This isn't what we get though. How can you call this film anything substantial when manipulation is at the heart of it? Yes there are truths in the movie but would you believe a truth and a lie together if the truth was big enough? Yes racism still is a problem today but films like this don't help. In fact it sets us back further. Attempting to actually assert that nothing has changed in the last hundred years is not only a lie but it's insulting to everyone who helped to improve race relations in the country. I just wish more people could see beyond the obvious emotional manipulation in this faux-documentary. Made to pull at your heartstrings"

",-0.3412,0.9806,2019-10-11 00:00:00,6,"Let me start by saying any doco or movie that aims to illustrate the endemic inequality in the US is to be applauded. '13th' is no exception. It contains a lot of information that should open the eyes of many. Having said that, it is not a great documentary.My first objection is the music. While the songs used intermittently were effective, the score throughout was beyond heavy handed and distracting. The music was in direct competition with the people speaking and I, at least, found it difficult to follow along. It just never stopped and played throughout the movie. It was also unnecessarily emotive. I mean, the subject matter alone was pretty emotionally heavy, I didn't need any musical cues about how to feel. The other more technical complaint i have is that visually, it was a bit lacking. We see lots of talking heads from different angles, jumping from one person to the next quite rapidly. The occasional break to newspaper article was beyond welcome. There were still pics and such now and then, but not enough to switch it up. More graphic illustrations would have helped.As for the most important part -- the information -- it could have been more balanced and meatier. I'm not saying the info was not true (definitely not!) but there could have been more statistics and facts to back up the points. For example, there are the shocking numbers on the rise for incarcerations. Great, very effective, but why not simultaneously show the stats for whites, hispanics, etc. Compare the percentages. There were some other moments where I really wanted them to give more information to better paint the time and place, or give a better perspective. I could have done with fewer people 'teaching' me and repeating a lot of the same things.I would still recommend this movie to just about anyone. It was worthwhile, but just did not deserve all the praise it received as a documentary. 6.5/10"

Ronald Reagan loved the civil rights movement. But is hated because the war on drugs which is horrible for a person and their body especially with crack. Then we have the Clintons. Both criminals and talking with terrorists. This is possibly the only thing that was put across correctly.Next is the statistics, and the cases used within this documentary.
The statistics used are highly biased and aren't factored in100%. This is clearly seen when they state the population of Black people who h was something like 6% with 40% of them in jail. But the documentary is forgetting that they also commit more than 50% of crime. In addition to this with what Bill says about the 13 year old boy killing another 13 year old blog is something that black lives matter completely miss. Black on black. Crime is more prevalent and isn't talked about in the media or the black lives matter movement.
Finally the Donald Trump. When referencing Trump the Documentary has used voice clips and videos to falsely use against trump. This is a clear political bias that is being used to scare people into unsupportive this man and everything he is for. Even some of the quotes used are simply incorrect with the video used and some of the interviewees used quotes incorrectly.This documentary is political propaganda that is incorrectly used to destroy and separate a country just like that movie it references to.it sides with literal terrorists the black lives matter movement and males white people out to be a problem"

",0.0,-0.965,2018-02-12 00:00:00,8,"I try every year to watch as many, if not all, films nominated during Awards Season, especially the Oscar nominated movies, this documentary was one I had heard about, so I watched it when it was available on Netflix, directed by Ava DuVernay (Selma). The title is in reference to the 13th Amendment in the United States Constitution, this was responsible for the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. Basically the film focuses the criminal justice system in America, specifically the ""intersection of race, justice and mass incarceration in the United States"". It also explores the fact that a majority of prisoners held in the various prisons around the States are African American, many of them have convicted for one crime that is perhaps not as serious as others, e.g. possession of drugs, vagrancy, and that the number of prisoners increases every decade. It also delves into how racism has played significant roles in history, in films (like The Birth of a Nation and 12 Years a Slave), and in the political climate, including the creation of the KKK (Ku Klux Klan), Martin Luther King and Malcolm X fighting for Civil Rights, and Barack Obama becoming the first black man to become President of the United States. Over the years, many have tried to combat race related issues in various ways, even Presidents have made statements about combatting the ""war on drugs"", a subtext for racial issues. It is a fact that the United States is 5% of the world's population, but it has 25% of the world's prisoners. Using archive clips, and interviews from politicians, activists, academics and former presidents, it really makes you realise that the treatment of black people is perhaps still being tackles, with protesting, militarisation of law enforcement, and police shootings becoming key issues. It does have disturbing images from the past, including about slavery, the original perceptions of black people, segregation (with ""coloured"" bathrooms) and other injustices, and the rules of imprisonment are harsh. Recently featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I can see why this is an important film, it really delivers its message that there are still changes to be made in America, especially when it comes to laws and racial equality, it is a shocking, fascinating and insightful documentary. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. Very good!"

I've been enough to that country to know how people think and are over there. Not that everybody is the same, far from that, but besides the beautiful country it is for nature, the uglier it is for their white patriotism and racism against everything that is not white as them. The negative reviews this documentary gets are for 100% sure coming from those same white patriots, or the richer republican bourgeoisie, people with no feelings about real life. I've traveled a lot in my life and I never been in a country with more patriotic flags attached to their house. Patriots that think they know it all and need to teach the rest of the world how you should live. Well they couldn't be more wrong about the standards and morals of life. America, land of the free, it's just the most absurd thing to say. Free for the rich yes, but the rest are seen as pariah. If you are rich and guilty of a crime you get away with in America, but if you are innocent and poor your chances are as good as non-existant to be judge a free man. I'm married to an American, and she's my true love, but I will be damned if I ever set foot again in that biased country. That people vote for a racist sexist like Trump says enough about that country. You can think of me what you want, I couldn't care less, I live in the real land of the free, where all people are equal. It doesn't matter what color they are. Justice is here the same for everybody. This documentary should be mandatory in every school and household in America, maybe then people will open their eyes.

""Selma"" director Ava DuVernay's Netflix documentary ""13th"" homogenizes a lot of discussion and history into a profound resource on the black experience in America with an emphasis on the post-Civil Rights era. To use the most relevant terms, it explains why, in fact, black lives matter.DuVernay and her ""Selma"" editor Spencer Averick have crafted an extremely efficient overview of this subject matter. Despite its purely educational purpose, the stringing together of facts and footage of so many troubling moments over the last 50 years creates an unavoidable emotional resonance. When shown in contexts where it will matter most, ""13th"" will undoubtedly be politicized, but the documentary reveals decade by decade that no single political party is to blame for what we today refer to as the mass incarceration epidemic. From Nixon and Reagan's War on Drugs to Clinton's ""Three Strikes,"" politicians posturing to be tough on crime created laws that disproportionately affected people of color to the point that today, one in every three black men is expected to serve jail time.At its most fundamental, the film suggests that the wording of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery ""except as a punishment for crime,"" has allowed for modern-day systems of oppression to go unchecked. The film assumes no intentional wrongdoing – no cries of a conspiracy among any person or group of persons to enslave black people through disguised means – but rather it shines a light on the racial animus that many people claim no longer exists, which underpins those means. To say that fear, mistrust and hatred of ""the other"" has nothing to do with the enactment of laws and policies that hurt people of color is to be willfully ignorant of history. The way these attitudes manifest themselves has simply gotten less direct.The educational framing of ""13th"" puts a limit on the film's creativity, but techniques such as motion graphics, incorporating relevant music and lyrics and the thoughtful environments where DuVernay interviews the film's many commentators help elevate the material where possible. Nothing about ""13th"" breaks ground or reveals something that wasn't being told at all, but few can argue that there's a documentary more necessary right now for the education of the American people than ""13th.""~Steven CThanks for reading!

Spencer Averick edited the film. Produced and filmed in secrecy, 13th was revealed only after it was announced as the opening film for the 2016 New York Film Festival, the first documentary ever to open the festival.This is a great film about segregation, racial disparity, and laws about crime. But it does meaner a bit. From private prisons to ALEC to drugs to Wal-Mart's gun sales... it seems like some of this is not really directly connected to the central thesis. Though much of this does support an important point that few seem to grasp: the 13th Amendment effectively legalizes slavery, so long as a crime exits."

The War on Drugs started by the Nixon administration (DuVernay includes an incredible quote from John Erlichman admitting that the ""War on Drugs"" was a ploy to persecute anti-war protesters and African Americans) is shown to have been a tool to exploit the public's fear of black men and push agendas to get people elected and to allow corporations to profit from the prison system. A superb documentary that perhaps attempts to make few tenuous connections here or there, but is generally spot on ... and amazingly infuriating as a result."
" Poignant but inaccurate
",0.0,-0.9899,2017-07-22 00:00:00,4,"This documentary was truly poignant and inspiring. I have no issue with the motivation or the legitimacy of the increase in prison population or the fact that minorities make up more of the population than social majorities. I also acknowledge and appreciate the patterns throughout history that may have contributed to this problem. I do, however, have an issue with the fact that many ""facts"" were exaggerated for the purpose of sensationalism. The ratios of population demographics, the prison population numbers, and the skewed political views made it very difficult to appreciate or trust the documentary's information. There are real numbers and statistics that support the basis of this film, however, they are not the ones presented in the documentary. For example, the population numbers are inclusive of local jail inhabitants despite being labeled ""prison"" population, increasing the numbers by hundreds of thousands for dramatic effect. Also, the documentary stats are that African-American males make up 6.5% of the US population, which is true. The documentary also states that African-American males make up 40.2% of the prison population. In reality, African-American Inmates of both genders make up 34.8% according to the Department of Justice's 2014 report. Hispanic/Latino inmates of both genders make up 34.9% while Caucasian inmates of both genders make up 27%. These numbers are accurate but not as dramatic as the ones presented in the documentary. They are still disturbing since they are not proportioned with the US population, showing minorities at a gross disadvantage since Hispanic/Latino and African-American races make up roughly 70% of the prison population despite only making up roughly 30% of the United States Population based on the 2010 Census. The problem is legitimate. The documentary's statistics are not. They also did not address the serious economic failings of our last president that contributed to poverty which contributes to crime, unemployment, and drug rates, however they did address failings in every other administration. The documentary was also politically skewed, using propaganda and voice overs out of context to disparage a certain political party or individual. Therefore, their political views could not be seen as objective either. Individuals presenting an issue of such grave importance should not allow themselves to be discounted by giving into the temptation for sensationalism, dramatics, and petty propaganda. Let the true facts speak for themselves to make known that the issue is real and must be addressed."

The only problem I have with it, is that it should have been a docuseries instead of a film. It's too short to properly delve into the subject matter. Race relations, the war on drugs, the war on crime, privatization of prisons, mass incarceration-these topics are too great and the history is too rich to adequately and thoroughly describe in just two hours."

",-0.289,-0.7582,2017-06-18 00:00:00,5,"There are some interesting things to learn here. Stylistically it's very nice. I'd guess a child as young as 12 would be fine watching this mentally, maybe not emotionally though. It's not dense. The problem is the stats are cherry picked, and all the powerful moments are not cohesive. I think the creator was hoping to find some evidence that the working in prisons was the reason that the government puts a lot of people in prison (conspiracy)-that would fit perfectly with the title. But no evidence is provided for this theory, the closest it gets is the ALEC stuff, the fact that corperations craft legislation (obviously they don't vote on it).Prison is not perfect as a solution to crime in society, that's for sure. At the end we learn that electronic monitoring may be gaining traction with politicians as it would save money. But the film seems to be against this too, for the reason that it would be unfair to black people, and a continuation of slavery/segregation in a new way (my impression of their reasoning.) No suggestions of something that would work better than electronic monitoring or prison, for what to do about criminals. I felt it was very biased. It does make me curious to watch other similar documentaries."
" People are not a commodity
",0.0,-0.9907,2017-04-27 00:00:00,8,"In this eye opening documentary, the prison system is exposed as modern day slavery. The basis for this conclusion is a single line from the 13th amendment, ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime..."". Did you catch that? Slavery was made illegal, except as a punishment. In other words, the 13th amendment introduced a new form of slavery, the prison system. In regard to the films bias. The producer tries to remain balanced and nonpartisan, but it is clear that the there is a specific agenda at work. The first half of the film has a fairly balanced representation of both democrats and republicans as part of the problem, but the in the final 45 minutes the scales are woefully tipped to only spotlight liberal perspectives. This is the worst aspect of the film and the reason my review is not higher. I found that the heart of the film is not in a broken justice system, but instead in the value of people. Prisoners are people. Each has a story. The escalating number of prisoners has torn families apart and removed opportunity from otherwise productive members of our society. I am in favor of consequences for wrong actions, however the film highlights that there is a great deal of injustice in the system that results in unnecessary and overwhelming consequences. In a society that is built on treating people equally, the prison system with it's billion dollar economic system, often tramples on those values. Herein lies the tension. How do we honor and value all people and hold people accountable for their wrong actions? A prevailing value in our culture is that all people deserve fair and equal treatment. This is found throughout our justice system, but was born our of the Bible's text, ""For God does not show favoritism."" (Rom. 2:11; Acts 10:34), et al. The people in prison are fellow human beings that deserve dignity and respect. They also need someone to be their voice to stand up for the injustice in they system. Not just for them but also for their children and grandchildren. The voice of this film is a clarion call for justice reform on behalf of this generation and the next. I give my highest recommendation for this important work."

" A Mess
",-0.3612,-0.9968,2017-04-18 00:00:00,5,"This movie has some good information about the prison-industrial complex. But it contains misleading and even inaccurate information, conflates so many different things it becomes a jumbled mess and even ends up contradicting itself.The film does a good job, more than 30 minutes into its footage, of beginning to explain how many laws have been passed and prisons built solely for the purpose of corporate profits. What it doesn't explain is how and why the public supported those laws and prisons. The public didn't support mass incarceration in the 80s and 90s because of racism, which seems to be the film's argument. The public supported tough-on-crime measures because there was a massive crime wave related to the crack cocaine epidemic.If you are under 45 you wouldn't remember this, but Blackcommunities in the inner cities were under siege, with drive-by-shootings a regular occurrence. A local TV news station in Washington DC had a nightly program called ""City Under Siege."" You don't hear about this in Ava Duvernay's film. Her perspective seems to be that the crack epidemic was a fiction invented by white people. It most definitely was not a fiction and there was no similarity between the heavily armed drug gangs having shootouts on city streets and the suburban powder cocaine dealer who didn't own a gun and made home deliveries. If you want to know a bit what the crack epidemic and the drug gang shoot-outs were like see the films ""New Jack City"" and ""Boyz in the Hood"" which by the way were made by black people.Is the prison-industrial complex because of corporate greed, or is it because of racism? It can't be both because corporate greed doesn't care about racism. Incarcerating white people is also profitable.The film swings wildly at one point from Bill Clinton's policies such as ""three strikes you're out"" to the murder of Fred Hampton by police which I think took place around 1970, then to the fact Martin Luther King Jr. had an FBI file. The notion seems to be that it's all about black people being oppressed by law enforcement but it's offensive to conflate a petty criminal with a Black Panther with a non-violent protest leader. They all become the same, black victims, in this film. Historical epochs are meaningless in Duvernay's view because she thinks nothing has changed. This film is intellectually dishonest and verges on being paranoid."

" Stop Playing The Race Card If You Want To Be Taken Seriously
",-0.2023,-0.9985,2017-04-11 00:00:00,4,"This is an Oscar nominated documentary . Its title is taken from the 13th amendment to the United States constitution which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude and apparently the disparity in rich and poor is so great in America that slavery still exists. I came to this documentary thinking that the documentary had a point. After all in America you have ""workfare"" where to receive state benefit you have to clean up litter etc . America still incorporates chain gangs and thankfully in Britain European Union legislation protects us from this exploitation which is nothing more than modern day slavery so yeah I came in to it ready to cheer for a classless society for my American brothers and sisters , fellow members of the international proletariat. Long before 13th finished I was actually booing The documentary comes in thee distinct parts and the first third is the worst. It gives a potted history of slavery in America and towards the end of this segment takes in the war against crime. What's the connection between the two ? Apparently it's all down to keeping the black population in their place and is a big conspiracy to criminalise blacks in order to jail them so they'd be slaves again. To be fair 13th that Richard Nixon introduced ""the war on drugs"" and Republican President Ronald Reagen took an even harder line. Common sense should tell someone the problem is if you outlaw a product then anyone who uses it becomes by definition an outlaw. But not here where it's all an excuse for right wing racist politicians to wage war on black people. This is all taken as fact so it's no good bringing statistics in to anything apart from the burgeoning prison population so I won't bother mentioning things like if America legalised all drugs and the state manufactured everything from weed to crack cocaine for dimes that cure a terrible problem and prohibition is bad because 13th wants to play the race card instead of talking sense To be fair it doesn't suffer from party politics bias because the Democrats are every bit as bad as the Republicans. Yes indeed Bill Clinton was pro death penalty and anti-crime , so much so a little known British Labour MP called Tony Blair went over to America to see how the slick spin doctors of the Democrats operated and came back with the slogan ""Tough on crime tough on the causes of crime"". Such a pity Blair never thought about winning a major battle against crime by legalising drugs. Even if you think Clinton and Blair were being draconian being anti-crime is a vote winner because everyone in general and lower class people in particular are the ones who suffer so why not give the electorate what they want? That's because it's all a big conspiracy to jail black people just for being black. As it turns out Clinton in shown in a clip saying he thought that his anti-crime legislation was a mistake. Why is it a mistake now ? Probably because like this documentary Clinton tells people what they want to hear and truth doesn't come in to it The second segment revolves around the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) which is responsible for amongst other things state level legislation and private prisons. Among other things it involves the ""stand your ground law"" where a person can use deadly force to protect themselves. It uses a high profile case that made worldwide headlines. Again the race card is used in this case but the fact is every state in America has a similar law, not just the states who have the stand your ground law, but again there's the insinuation that it's all a big conspiracy to put all the black people in jail. The third segment then tries to back up these statistics by pointing out the large number of black men jailed. Might it not be social rather than ethnic demographics have something to do with this ? ie if you're poor and white then you're more chance of going to jail than someone middle class and white ? And if you're black and committed a crime against a person might the person be black themselves ? Don't let an agenda get in the way of facts If nothing else 13th does go to show that Americans regardless of their background all seem to suffer from an irony deficiency we see a bunch of academics and politicians saying how much African Americans are suffering from institutional racism much of which is a conspiracy by a racist white elite. If this is the case then how on earth were the black academics and politicians interviewed able to get where they are ? If there was a conspiracy then I doubt if Ava Duvarney would have been able to make this documentary and Barack Obama would have never been allowed to run for President never mind winning two Presidential elections. It could be that people are conditioned in to being victims they will never get anywhere and despite being well made 13th is another contribution to keep the downtrodden proletariat in their place"

This reform was set to put an end to slavery, and when it passed, many thought it marked the end of racial discrimination that tattered our country (especially the South). Regrettably so, the unfair treatment against African-Americans still lingered, and it's a problem that still remains active to this day. While many influential figures such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. contributed to such political movements such as the Civil Rights of 1964, many African-Americans are struggling to find for their freedom in various areas. One of which involves the law enforcement, and how the prison system has continued to react reasonable towards crime committed by the white community, while given an unfair treatment towards the black community. Directed by Ava DuVernay who last took charge of the MLK biopic 'Selma', this thought-provoking documentary focuses on the history of the mass incarceration of African-Americans, and how it shed light on America's corrupt practice of racial inequality in the prison system. With the mass incarceration rate growing rapidly year by year, this film offers a deep intake of on how African-American have fallen victim to unfair treatment by the legal system.Ava DeVernay's purpose for this documentary is not to offer a bias sentiment on our country's legal system but to open the spotlight of an issue that has put racial tensions and the law enforcement into bitter collision. Embarking on the history of the 13th Amendment, this film pedals on the harrowing history of unethical conduct against the African-American community including lynching and hate crimes such as the murder of Emmett Till. DeVarnay powerfully supports the material with interviews of college professors and archive news footage of protests, beatings, and police brutality -- all of which are very haunting to watch. DeVernay also gears in the effort of touching on various policies the government's attempts on passing policies in reaction to the epidemic of prejudice treatment against the colored community. A vast majority of this material leads to the vital commentary of our country's prison system which has exhibited an alarming amount of imprisonment of wrongly accused black citizens. The further the film goes on, the more heart- stirring it proceeds as it grows more and more evident on how our society has fallen shallow in justice against the historically underprivileged demographic. Most importantly, it touches firmly on an issue that still remains wildly relevant to this day, especially when you turn on the news. Although some will argue the film plays on their emotions, it only offers a unpleasant truth of a controversial issue.13th is a harrowing, thought-provoking documentary that makes an enthralling delivery of a haunting issue that has affected our society in many decades, while offering a crucial historical lesson on the clash between race and law enforcement. It is not pleasant to sit through nor does it offer a bias agenda. But most importantly, it is a documentary that deserves your attention."
" too much room for improvement
",0.4588,-0.9184,2017-03-25 00:00:00,5,"I am a member of the target demographic who would be predicted to be sympathetic and supportive of this film. I really was looking forward to this film and upon seeing it pop on netflix immediately sat down to watch it. The film does a great job of laying out the political landscape that led to where we are on this issue and all the stripes of the political players who made this reality we find ourselves in today. It also does a great job regarding the cultural landscape and historical context that led us to where we are on this issue. The history of slavery, racism, KKK and civil rights movement is covered very well and captured powerfully in images that are difficult to look at. But there are some serious omissions that should have been addressed and its not a oversite that can easily be dismissed. Specifically, 1) If you are going to bring the drug war into this discussion, you should include an examination as to why poor neighborhoods and regions are saturated with these substances. If you don't, you allow the naysayers to run to easy cover under the shelter of ""law and order"" which only takes a few breathes before one starts blaming the imprisoned for getting caught up in the systematic net that was set up and created by design. 2) If you are going to compare statistics or numbers, you need to make damn sure you are comparing apples to apples and not using them willy nilly. If you don't, you look like at worst a propagandist and at best, just plain stupid. This issue is pivotal to the culture we find ourselves in as Americans today. There is no room for slapdash half measures to raise public awareness that we are slowly but surely moving towards a military state. A process during which the populace is taking it all in stride, swallowing the trigger language whole and behaving like frogs in a pot of water being slowly heated on the stove. The filmmakers could have done better and should have done better as it would not required much effort or much more research. They did not serve the issue well with this film and that is frankly tragic."
" Liked It, But It's Overshadowed by Other Better Documenatries That Came Out in the Same Year
",0.6956,0.9382,2017-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Be patient with ""13th,"" Ava DuVernay's documentary about how the American prison system has become a modern-day fill-in for slavery. For a long time, the film is a mess, scattered and unfocused. But gradually the various threads come together in support of her central thesis, and what emerges is an accusation aimed at the American white establishment and American big business that benefits financially from keeping the rest of America convinced that black men are criminals and deserve to be incarcerated.Whether or not you find DuVernay's arguments convincing depend I guess on how well you think she makes them. I liked ""13th"" while I was watching it, but I'm writing this comment while in the middle of watching ""O.J.: Made in America,"" a film that tackles many of the same themes but handles them all much better, and I have to admit that I can barely remember DuVernay's film now thinking back on it.Nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 2016 Academy Awards.Grade: B+"
" Half facts, half propaganda
",-0.25,-0.9944,2017-03-03 00:00:00,4,"Fair warning: I am aware my review will be downvoted into oblivion like everyone else who recognized the film is a propaganda piece. If you're willing to recognize an alternate (but factual) viewpoint, carry on.This film had potential to be great, if it wasn't biased. For example, around 46 minutes, Assata Shakur is brought up, being called a revolutionary hero. However, the film intentionally left out why she was serving a lifetime prison sentence, so I looked it up. She was a gang member and a cop killer, and the entire Black Lives Matter movement (literally a terrorist group by definition) is based on her. In fact, her alternate name is being used in the film so you don't immediately recognize this (if you previously knew about her).But if this was included in the film, the argument would've fallen apart immediately. The film tried to use her as an example of the FBI going after a powerful black figurehead, such as with MLK. You cannot compare those two individuals simply because they're both black and both were wanted by the FBI. They were completely different people.Beyond that example, which is just one of many instances of the purposeful omission of key information, the film simply grabs at straws. The concept is based on the oppression and ""slavery"" of African Americans beyond the Civil Right Movement. Yes, obviously this did happen, and the film did present some significant examples, such as presidents and elite politicians subtly having racist motives.Where this film fails is by not addressing significant philosophical and sociological questions. It does not discuss how, because African Americans were oppressed and many lived in cities, they could not find work or they lived in poverty. And what happens when you live in poverty, regardless of race or ethnicity? You're more inclined to turn to drugs and crime. So there's a reason to be arrested. In fact, while the film tries to say black people were specifically hurt by certain laws, those laws hurt everyone, regardless of race or ethnicity.The film doesn't discuss how the black race is, unfortunately, largely represented by an urban subculture which glorifies crime and violence as a progressive result of poverty. The film would've been better if it introduced this, because then the interesting argument of a cycle is created:Black oppression > stereotypes > poverty > excessive drugs, violence, and crime > tougher laws > longer prison sentences > further emphasis on stereotypes and racismThe film completely blows over this, and instead basically says, ""Black people did nothing wrong! It's all the white man's fault, trying to make us slaves again!"" In the last three decades, there have been many, many important African American members of society who made something of themselves, fought their way out of economic hardship, and so on. How about Jimi Hendrix, Neil Tyson, Oprah, Michael Jackson, Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, the former president, etc. What do they have in common? They weren't involved in that glorified subculture. In addition, the film is intended to be a combination of both black oppression and the insane incarceration rate in the USA, but it would've been better off not trying to say, ""It's the white man's fault!"" Discussing the prison-for-profit system and unfair poverty in the USA we have without incorporating a falsified perspective of racism would've been better.What you'll get here is a ridiculous argument about how the modern-day prison system is exactly like the post-slavery prison system, in which slaves were arrested for petty crimes to work for free again and rebuild the economy. The modern era is nothing like that, and does not unfairly affect blacks. It affects criminals."

" Relentless and affecting, but deliberately overwhelming in style
",0.0258,0.6924,2017-02-20 00:00:00,7,"I want to be clear that I am not reviewing the message presented by this film, a flaw in documentary reviewing that I find very common, even (especially?) among professional movie critics.Instead, I want to address how this film works as a film in delivering its message.13th is clearly intended to shock its audience. Its message is a wholly unpleasant reality to deal with - the idea that institutional racism is arguably as prevalent in the US today as it has ever been and that it serves the wealthy in maintaining their power and wealth. I consider myself to be relatively well-informed about the privatisation of the jail system in the US and other matters that the film highlights, such as police brutality and attempts to disenfranchise black Americans in many states. However, I did find 13th shocking still, and felt at the end of it that I had learned more than I perhaps even wanted to know. The film commanded my attention and, largely, stayed on topic and linked its points together credibly.Having said this, I did find that the pace of information delivered and the rapid editing was simply overwhelming at times. More than once, I had to wind back and listen to a point again, simply because my brain was still trying to register what was pouring into it. This made the film feel like a deliberate assault on the senses.A good illustration of this is the multitude of talking heads that are brought into the movie one after the other, all facing different directions, though they're the only thing on screen at the time, with barely a pause for breath between each point. The effect was as if there were 15 people in a room all talking over each other, but the camera is only ever on one of them at a time. Clearly these are all individual interviews, filmed separately, so why does director Ava DuVernay feel the need to present them all in such a haphazard manner? It felt to me that the only reason for this is to make the viewer disoriented as all of this information comes rushing at them. In short, to make them less able to critically analyse what is being said. It feels like the technique used by someone who isn't telling the truth. Now I am not arguing that this is the case here - I don't think that it is - so why make the style like this? I think that the message of this movie is shocking enough without the need to pummel the audience into submission with the way it is edited and I think that it's a shame that this was the choice made. With some audiences I imagine it will backfire and they will feel alienated by a message they may otherwise have accepted.Overall, I definitely applaud this film for its ability to enlighten audiences about an important issue, but I fault it for choosing to do so in such an overwhelming manner, which makes real-time critical assessment of its message difficult."
" A Simplistic Approach to a Complex Ptoblem
",0.0,-0.2383,2017-02-14 00:00:00,4,"Because it is almost impossible to separate the message from the filmmaking, 13TH is difficult to review solely as a film. It is important to note that this is a documentary, not journalism. 13TH is a propaganda piece advancing a clear point of view while omitting information that does not support its premise. Michael Moore and Dinesh D'Souza have made documentaries that also lack the objectivity of journalism.Some of Moore's documentaries manage to be entertaining while also advancing Moore's beliefs. 13TH is too strident to be entertaining. That lack of entertainment makes the film difficult to separate from its message. The cinematography is competent but unremarkable. The editing reinforces the message but nothing more. Without its message, 13TH is a slightly below-average film.Easily 75% of the film presents truths that are tough to refute or argue. However, those accustomed to the objectivity desired in journalism ought to take issue with 13TH when it does omit contradicting information.Perhaps most glaringly, 13TH ignores homicide statistics. While incarceration rates in the U.S. soared, the homicide rate plummeted. The nation needs to find ways to achieve the lower homicide rate without incarcerating so many people. Police tactics like stop and frisk likely saved lives, but those same tactics also have ensnared too many innocent people.13TH suggests that secret racism is behind the incarceration rate and aggressive police tactics. By ignoring the declining homicide rates, the film ignores that some of the public support for mandatory sentencing and tough policing is motivated by a desire for fewer racial minorities to be killed.A good portion of 13TH focuses on the suggestion that the prison system has become privatized and mass incarcerations have occurred for financial gain. While all of these arguments hold water, the film obviously ignores Al Sharpton becoming a multi-millionaire through his racial activism. The prison-industrial complex is not the only source of lobbying funds in Washington. Millions of dollars flow in and out of Washington in support of racial equality. Some filmmakers might even make money and win awards off of their civil rights activism.13TH suggests that through a clause in the 13th Amendment, slavery essentially continues unabated in the U.S. Eight years before the release of this film, this nation elected its first black president. The filmmaker does not appear ever to have been incarcerated. Some of the talking heads in the film like Cory Booker have not been incarcerated. The nation has moved forward considerably, but 13TH is correct in its depictions of the challenges still faced by some racial minorities.These issues are far more complex than the simple message of 13TH. It is unfortunate that the film neither attempts to present a call to action, nor does it convey the complexities that make solutions difficult to find. Ultimately, 13TH will make plenty of money off of those who already share its point of view.A more powerful film might affect societal change. Financial success and accolades will be the main accomplishments of 13TH."
" Bad name
",-0.5423,-0.8876,2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"The number 13 again used and identified as a bad number. But apart from the number connected to a law that was supposed to do a lot of good and instead only shifted things. So while there technically aren't any slaves in America (not talking about illegal working, human trafficking or anything else against the law), this law makes it possible to have some within the context of the law.Now while you may think criminals are bad people and I should not care about them, I'd advice you to watch this movie and maybe you reconsider what you think. It's not an easy movie to watch and it does put its finger into a wound that has not healed. And even without watching the interview the director gave to Oprah (late 2016 it was, because Trump already was elected, who's also prominent in this documentary), you can tell it was thoroughly investigated and there was a lot of time spent into the making of it, the ""sets""/interview locations, the editing and the Questions.

" Response to comment about false statistics

It took my about 5 minutes to clear up the differing statistics. The commenter mentioned that the film lists a 2.4M prison population as of 2014, while the DOJ's report released through the BJS states that the prison population in 2014 was 1.5M. The glaring difference between the two figures is very easily explained through the requirements necessary to be included by the BJS study. Anyone who is in a county holding facility for a period less than a year, or anyone being held at an immigration detention center, civil commitment, or an Indian Country facility are not included in the figures stated by the BJS. The Prison Policy Initiative study states that 2.4M people were detained and incarcerated for a period longer than 6 months in 2014 with no other limiting factors applied to their study. Checking facts is good, but is worthless if you don't check them well by corroborating multiple sources and reviewing the requirements and limiting factors applied to the statistical studies you are comparing. If you are only checking one source, there is no comparison happening, and you are ultimately just accepting the first response you came across without understanding what is included or not included in that particular study. That is called googling, not fact or source checking."
" Mass incarceration of African-Americans cogently tied to legacy of slavery but solutions may be a bit naive
",-0.5423,-0.996,2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"Ava DuVernay, known for last year's ""Selma,"" now enters the documentary field with 13th, a provocative take on the nation's prison system. DuVernay argues that the legacy of slavery is responsible for the mass incarceration of African-Americans, who are disproportionately represented behind bars today.DuVernay goes further by maintaining that those incarcerated today are victims of a new kind of slavery. She reviews the shameful history of the discriminatory treatment of African Americans as a whole—and specifically references how blacks were unfairly targeted, especially in the South, to compensate for the lost economic advantage of the slave system.DuVernay explains how after Reconstruction, blacks were intentionally arrested on false or trumped up charges and often found themselves receiving draconian sentences that kept them incarcerated for years. Blacks were used as a labor force in a system that demanded work without compensation and perpetuated a system of de facto slavery.DuVernay then reviews the history of both economic and cultural discrimination perpetuated against African-Americans up until the Civil Rights era in which most became economically disenfranchised. DuVernay masterfully injects clips from D.W. Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation"" (the 1915 film praised by President Wilson who watched it a private screening at the White House), which probably was most responsible for the spreading of the noxious and racist notion of the inherent criminality of African-Americans.The theme of inherent black criminality was reinforced during the Civil Rights era when leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks were jailed and branded as criminals (going to jail soon became a badge of protest by those opposing the racist establishment). 13th illustrates the turbulence of the Civil Rights era featuring disturbing footage of a black man being assaulted by a mob of whites in broad daylight (later the same footage is juxtaposed with comments from Donald Trump at one of his campaign rallies urging followers to attack a black protester).DuVernay makes it clear that it was the 1970s, with Nixon's ""Law and Order"" policies, that led to the expanding numbers of African-Americans in the prison system. Quotations from Nixon's henchmen, including John Ehrlichman, confirm that blacks were intentionally targeted during this period. Nixon's ""war on drugs"" and the subsequent draconian Republican policies during the Reagan Administration were probably most responsible for the startling increase of African Americans in the prison system. Ironically, Duvernay trots out Republican Newt Gingrich, as a critic of America's failed war on drugs policy. It's Gingrich who bemoans the unfair disparity in sentencing between offenders charged with sale or possession of crack, as opposed to ""mere"" cocaine.DuVernay is also highly critical of Bill and Hillary Clinton—Hillary with her references to ""super predators"" and Bill's Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 responsible for reprehensible policies including mandatory minimums (taking away discretion from judges in sentencing) and the ""three strikes you're out"" law, targeting some convicted of non-violent felonies. While Clinton later apologizes for the deleterious effects of the 1994 bill, the damage cannot be undone.Perhaps the most revelatory information one takes away from this informative piece concerns the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative think tank responsible for model legislation on behalf of corporations. ALEC was most responsible for the development of private prison companies—thus mass incarceration was seen as a good thing since now individuals could profit from such a system. Later ALEC began advocating for the privatizing of probation and parole services, a new way to meld corporate profit with burgeoning prison populations.Despite her cogent analysis of what caused the disproportionate numbers of African-Americans in the prison system, DuVernay falls short on offering any alternatives to solve what has become such a vexing problem. There is no acknowledgment here there is a class of violent criminals that must be incarcerated no matter what. The call for alternatives to incarceration, such as drug and educational programs, is fine. But even with the introduction of those programs, there is no guarantee that offenders will take advantage of them.Given the legacy of slavery and years of discrimination, it's understandable why so many African-Americans have found themselves a statistic in the prison system. Ultimately, however, it's the individual offender who must decide whether to become a law-abiding citizen or not. The substitution of draconian policies with more humane ones is certainly a worthy goal—but will they still work? DuVernay seems to think they will. More skeptical students of human nature may not agree."
" Definitely something everyone should see!
",0.4574,-0.5964,2017-02-01 00:00:00,9,"'13TH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new documentary about the excessive racism in the United States criminal justice system, which is still going on today. The film is titled after the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; which outlawed slavery, except as a punishment for a crime. The film argues that slavery is still going on today, through the unfair (racist) imprisonment of minorities. It was directed, co-produced and co-written by Ava DuVernay; who also directed the critically acclaimed 2014 biopic 'SELMA' (which obviously also dealt with racism). The movie was distributed by Netflix, and it's received mostly positive reviews from critics; it was also nominated for Best Documentary Feature, at the upcoming Academy Awards. I think it's a very well made, and important film. The movie was filmed in secrecy, and it contains several interviews with prominent political figures; all discussing issues of racism, in the US criminal justice system. The overwhelming consensus is that minorities (primarily African Americans and Hispanics) are unfairly targeted by police; they're then also treated unfairly by our court system. Due to their financial struggles, they're unable to defend themselves (in any way) as well. Our prisons also partner with big businesses, to use these prisoners as slaves (essentially).I've definitely heard the film's basic thesis before; and some of the information presented in the movie isn't new at all. Still, it's all presented in a way that makes it a very tough argument to dismiss. I definitely agree with what DuVernay, and others, are saying in this movie; and I think she did an outstanding job brining it all together. Like 'BEFORE THE FLOOD', from earlier last year, this is arguably one of the most important movies of 2016.

" The Era of Mass Incarceration
",0.0,-0.9066,2017-01-31 00:00:00,9,"13th may not be the most watched film of the year, but it's certainly one of the most important. Coming off of Selma, Ava DuVernay directs yet another socially and politically relevant film (this time a documentary) relating to black history. 13th tackles the largely unjust prison system in America, and does so brilliantly.Having done feature films already, it's no wonder that 13th feels like it has a higher production value and a wider narrative scope than most documentaries. Everything from the production designs of the interviews to the way she implemented music and other variations of art into the film give it a more relatable quality. Sometimes it's not necessarily the message that is given more so than the way it is said that makes it most effective.13th doesn't always tackle just the prison system head on. Instead, it covers nearly one-hundred years worth of material as to why The United States' prison population has skyrocketed, and continues to do so. DuVernay suggests the likes of D.W. Griffith, the War on Drugs, and other political failures have contributed poorly to the rise of the prison population. Based on the facts, she's not all that wrong. The problem dates back a long time, and unless we take significant steps to change, it won't go away anytime soon.One of the things I hope for out of a documentary is to not just keep my attention throughout, but also to inform me about a topic that I wasn't overly familiar with. 13th tells the history of the unjust prison system in great detail and it notified me of several facts that I was completely unaware of. DuVernay didn't force any information down my throat either. Sometimes films based on divisive subjects have a tendency to do that, but 13th stayed grounded in realism and simply did a rundown of the history.

" Wildly Inaccurate Statistics
",0.0,-0.9992,2017-01-28 00:00:00,4,"First of all, there is plenty wrong with our prison system and word needs to get out about it. A portion of 13th discusses the privatized prison business; it's a huge problem. The portion on ALEC is informative and important for all Americans to know. There are significant injustices on young, black men: the story of Kalief Browder is heartbreaking and maddening. However, 13th fails in what I see as the biggest problem with most ""documentaries"" these days (aside from the fact that they don't actually qualify as documentaries by definition, see below): when they present numbers that are inaccurate, I become skeptical of ALL information they present. If you can't tell the truth on items which can be fact-checked, why should I trust your opinions? A lot of what is presented in 13th is done so through the lens of the storyteller, which is understandable, but numbers are cold, hard facts and when one gets those wrong, every point presented around it is discredited. It would take too long to fact check the whole movie so I'll focus on the most glaring inaccuracies: prison population. Throughout the documentary, the storyteller shows the rise in prison population over the last several decades and at 50:37, the U.S. prison population in 2014 is listed at 2,306,200. That was a staggering number for me so I immediately searched for statistics. The Bureau of Justice Statistics shows a total prison population (state and federal) of 1,562,319 for 2014. If you want to claim the DOJ pads their numbers to make them look better than they really are, I'll allow a margin of error. However, margins of error rarely creep above 5% and in this case, the margin of error would have to be 47.6% percent for that to be true. FORTY SEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT! In my mind, that's when the documentarian went from ""documentarian"" to ""storyteller"". She also showed the rise in prison population from decade to decade but failed to mention that the prison population has been consistently trending down year by year since 2009. Granted, the number is small percentage points but it's truth, nonetheless, and doesn't fit her viewpoint.The storyteller also lends a significant portion of the documentary to (emphatically) suggest that the war on drugs was designed to put black men behind bars and further suggests that it wildly succeeded. While I won't attempt to prove or disprove the intent of the war on drugs because I can't do so with fact (and neither can she, by the way), I can discredit her assertion of success. Again on the BJS report for prison population in 2014, 14.9% were locked up on drug-related charges (3.5% of those were possession, the other 11.4% were trafficking and other offenses). The largest population of black men in prison, 57.8%, were convicted of violent offenses (murder, manslaughter, rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated/simple assault). If the war on drugs (which was only a ploy to lock up non-white males, as asserted by the storyteller) is what caused such a jump in prison population, why are just under 15% of the total black prison population behind bars for drugs? And only 3.5% behind bars for drug possession?In addition, the statistics on total black male U.S. population and black male prison population are wildly inaccurate.Let me remind you of the descriptions of 13th on IMDb and Netflix:""In this thought-provoking documentary, scholars, activists, and politicians analyze the criminalization of African Americans and the U.S. prison boom.""""An in-depth look at the prison system in the United States and how it reveals the nations history of racial inequality.""Not only does this in-depth ""documentary"" about inequality in the prison system fail to even mention the reason most black men are incarcerated, it outright tells you the reason is war on drugs. I'm left incredibly frustrated because 13th squanders its opportunity to inform people about what's wrong in our judicial system by largely falsifying information. In addition, the way it's edited at the end perpetuates hate, fear, and separation, which does nothing to promote change but further creates divide. Finally, I'll leave you with the definitions of ""documentary"" and ""propaganda"". Documentary:adj. Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film. n. A work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration.Propaganda: noun : the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person: ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause; also : a public action having such an effect"

Wow!Score Grid (out of 4):Script/Story: 4Cinematography/Visual Effect: 3Editing: 4Sound/Musical Score: 4Production Design: 4Acting/Performance: N/AThis documentary had a point of view, and it presented it very persuasively. The strong narrative push, and its emotional and intellectual appeal, is the film's strongest point. Its weakest point was its imbalance. While it presented a politically balanced picture of the situation (political being defined as in our two- party system where both Republicans and Democrats were presented as contributing to the problem), I feel it needed more balance on the racial component.It is an excellent piece of film making and an extremely effective product in the documentary category. I particularly like the narrative structure, where interviews are cut between archival footage and textual and auditory storytelling. I was extremely moved by this compelling work."

As a white, middle-class person of some privilege in leafy England, there was a lot to take in, building on much of what I already knew (the delights of ALEC, for example).I love the way the film-maker re-threaded early historical footage showed in the early parts of the film again later on, but under different audio that gives a really bloody powerful sense of history repeating itself. This as a powerful piece, and a must-see. It seems some negative reviews on this platform are knee-jerk reactions from affronted white people who probably need to be a bit more honest with themselves and the world they live in. This is where corporate America gets into bed with Republican AND Democratic lawmakers to destroy the equality of opportunity that a fair society would want. And now Trump replaces Obama to condemn a country to four years in reverse. This much becomes obvious when watching a masterclass like this."

And that's why this movie is so credible, we have been reading about this here and there, but seeing it like this in this way, almost exactly like Chomsky have described it, came like a chock. The first thing that goes through my mind is ""a country's leaders who can accept such a system is no better than Herr Hitlers Germany back in the thirties"" (it wasn't before the forties the Nazis started killing Jews systematically)or any system that reduce its people to animals or even worse. The only way changing the system, i think, is if people say ""stop"" and demonstrate heavily or this can only end in massive catastrophe somehow."

These are the documentaries that can help bring about solutions or cause people to further recess into their respective camps. This documentary was a must see.It's funny how you can know a thing exists but not be aware of it. The title of the documentary, 13th, refers to the 13th amendment:""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.""The 13th amendment made slavery illegal EXCEPT in the case of punishment for a crime. That is the basis of the documentary as the creator interviews a myriad of people on the issue of crime & punishment, law & order, and the prison industrial complex.There are a host of sensitive issues discussed that largely revolve around race and almost as many sensitive images shown which also revolve around race; e.g. criminalizing of certain things, the rapidly growing prison population, the disproportionate and over-representation of Blacks and Latinos in prison and more. This was a bold and daring project and it was excellently done in my view. We got to hear scholars, activists, teachers and even politicians (even a contrite Newt Gingrich was shown) speak about the issue of crime and punishment and all it entails.The entire documentary was truly amazing. It was informative, it was insightful, it was inspirational and at the same time invidious. I'd be lying if I said it didn't cause harmful feelings, but I think that was the intent to some degree. There was a definite intent to trigger an emotional response and that it did. Movies that can get you emotionally involved tend to be the best. I'm partial to documentaries anyway. They usually take a lot of research and they usually expose the viewers to things they didn't know. That's precisely what 13th did. Through imagery, narrative and interviews we got to see things we'd just as well assume didn't exist. The prison problem we have does exist and it won't be going away without some real change."
