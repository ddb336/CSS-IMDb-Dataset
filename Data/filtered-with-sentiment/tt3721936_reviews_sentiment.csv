" Ambitiously Messy
",-0.3612,0.9895,2021-03-20 00:00:00,6,"Andrea Arnold's latest drama American Honey is a raw, primal and contemporary Jack Kerouac meets Easy Rider road movie centered around Star (Sasha Lane), a teenage girl living in stark poverty. After catching the eye of Jake (Shia LaBeouf), she becomes convinced to join a crew of carefree, magazine salespeople as they cross the country. Known as a ""mag crew,"" Star is a na√Øve young girl attracted to the care-free excitement of the crew consisting of social misfits and outcasts with limited prospects. Star is placed under tutelage of Jake, the crew's best seller, at the behest of Krystal (Riley Keough), the sexually uncouth yet ruthless mag crew manager.For the duration of the film, the audience is placed in an almost-voyeur situation in which the adventures of the mag crew and Star are chronicled. Through Star's youthful naivety, she finds herself traveling through the American landscape as she thrusts herself into various quagmires. These experiences give view to the underbelly of American life inhabited by the cynical, uneducated, dissatisfied and terminally-ripped off Middle American underclass, viewed from a point of youthful ignorance where all platitudes have been rejected. Star is the window from which this world is shown, and Sasha Lane's performance feels natural in its environment. The film ambitiously conveys a naked romp through the summer night, exposing those far outside of this experience to something unpleasant, unusual and quite foolish.However, the film demands that it be viewed without judgment as it absorbs one into its abyss in an effort not be loved or liked, but to understood. The ambition with which the film is made is quite admirable in that despite its messy presentation and needless 3-hour run time, it forces thought and consideration of something beyond what is required as a standard or viewed as an accepted norm. The excursion of American Honey is one of arthouse grandeur that is likely to attract a certain audience while immediately repelling all others. However, its purpose seems less about commercialization or mass appeal.Instead, Andrea Arnold's film is more about extrapolating the thought found in the commonalities of the mainstream American experience into another part of its landscape that is far less understood, explored and viewed without an air of dismissive judgment. In doing so, American Honey may not become a kind of luxurious journey into youthful decadence as some more glorifying explorations have been. However, it will provoke a reaction and fester itself into the mind of the viewer. A film both this ambitious and messy can't help but so do."
" Real rating . . see below
",0.0,0.8183,2021-01-31 00:00:00,1,"4 stars . . Starts unrealistic and continues throughout. Right off , this girl taking care of 2 kids (we aren't sure who's) and digging through a dumpster for food, has a $600 tattoo and smokes but no money, no job, and no food stamps or government help (this is obviously NOT America). We move on to 2+ hours of rap music, driving in a van and more unrealistic scenarios. I loved Kids, but this movie is pretty much garbage. It tries, and the actors are decent, but the message is not realistic."
" A ride full of adulthood that goes nowhere 7/10
",0.0,0.9631,2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,"""American Honey"" is a movie that focuses on adulthood, it's not a random teenage movie but rather a one that shows the features of teenagers this age, their responsibilities and actions. The movie follows a young girl named Star who joins a group of teenagers like her in a quest around the country selling magazines. Star falls in love with Jake and forms a strong attachment to the group she joined. The movie mostly shows the teens screwing around, drinking, smoking and travelling far away from their lives and responsibilities. The reason Star is leaving her home in the first place is to get away from her old life and become a free teenager, no matters to take care of but herself. The movie has a very clear tone of rebellion among the generation seen in the movie, a sense of wanting to break free from the matters and codes in today's society. Unfortunately the movie doesn't have any consequences towards the end, nothing of a shocker happens throughout the film and Star the main character ends up still hanging around with the group with no turning events. The movie could have ended in so many ways: Star dies at the end or Jake.
The group of teenagers are involved in a car accident that kills most of them.
Star returns to her home town after acknowledging that this life doesn't suit for her.
All the teenagers are caught by the police, separated and sent to jail.
Overall what I'm saying is that the movie could have ended in a much more dramatic and different way. Instead of an open ending with no consequences, the movie should have had a darker and harder ending to affect the viewers, show them that eventually no teenager is safe no matter how much liberty they have or how rebellious they can be. None of the characters here were 100% safe nor untouchable by what could have happened to them. All in all this is a teenage movie ride that goes nowhere."
" This movie is a meandering, aimless trainwreck
",0.0,0.9259,2020-11-23 00:00:00,5,"Some reviews have been comparing this film to Larry Clark's ""Kids"", but other than following around a group of high-school and young adult aged people and giving the viewers some insight into their lives, there isn't much resemblance.Be prepared for a long film with many scenes that seem to extend far beyond their intended purpose and a lot of fluffy filler shots of flowers and landscapes. The film could have easily been reduced to two hours and maintained the same impact on the viewers.The story is set in America's midwest about a young lady named Star (Sasha Lane) who seems to be in a dead-end situation in her own personal life. The film does a very good job of portraying the bleak hopelessness and malaise that seems to be persistent throughout Star's world and life. She sees a group of traveling misfits making a scene at a grocery store and becomes intrigued about their lifestyle. Eventually she joins the delinquents in an adventure to make money through a door-to-door magazine selling scam.The film is about her journey to find a place where she feels that she belongs. There is a pretty run-of-the mill love triangle involving Star, Jake (Shia LaBeouf), and the head of the gang of future meth-heads. The flick has it all in terms of trainwreck qualities. There is a poor shoot-out scene, a lot of horrible decision making on the part of Star including severe alcoholism and prostitution. Star doesn't really go anywhere in this movie and seems to go from one desperate, hopeless situation to another one.There is no real overarching moral to this story. It is more of a snapshot of what can be assumed to be a somewhat typical life of a young adult living in America's meth basket of a heartland. The importance of the film is captured in the mood and the ambience that surrounds Star and the group of degenerates that likely have accomplished everything they will ever accomplish in their miserable, pointless, putrid lives by the time they were 15 years old.The soundtrack is a huge highlight of this film, with an excellent mix of some heavy hitting hip-hop and ethereal indie tunes."
" The worst movie I've ever seen.
",-0.6249,-0.8331,2020-11-16 00:00:00,1,"If you want to slow down time watch this movie. There is no plot, no story, nothing. Just a bunch of scenes that don't go together and make no sense.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME."
" Unacceptable swearing!
",-0.6476,-0.9934,2020-11-06 00:00:00,1,"Unacceptable and gratuitous swearing!
What's the meaning of? Offending a religion is unacceptable! If you don't believe in God is OK, offending Him is just because you're idiot and stupid and you don't have any respect for the others! Shame on the director! Anyway he'll reap what he sow!
No race, gender, people, religion has to be offended, it doesn't matter whether or not you believe in something, respect is respect, if you don't have respect for the others, it means you don't respect yourself.
My review is finished as I'm not going on watching this awful thing.
That idiotic girl (Star), expressed herself showing her incapacity to understand not even the smallest thing because she's a little, dull, useless person.
The actress might be good, but I'm sure 100% that if she refused to say that OFFENSIVE lines, nobody would have her fired, so she's guilty like the director.
I'm deeply offended, because I believe in God and my religion has been offended, without any acceptable reason.
Never I'm going to watch anything else shot from this director.
If the director would have done something like that in an Arabic Country, he would be killed."
" Let's not pretend this is good
",0.4932,-0.296,2020-10-23 00:00:00,4,"After 'Kids' and 'Thirteen' we did not need poorly executed wannabee versions like 'Spring Breakers', 'Mid 90's' and 'American Honey'.
It has already been done, nobody is still in shock about a couple of drunk teenagers and a lot of nudity. There is literally no point in telling this story. Cheap thrills."
" Brilliant and directionless
",0.5859,0.7035,2020-10-16 00:00:00,7,"Maybe that was the point?The cinematography of this film is seriously excellent, 10/10. Most of the film had a very real and genuine feel to it. The acting was on par as well. Being that the runtime flirts with 3hrs you're waiting for some profound character development or plot. It's not there, it never comes. That's okay for some people, for others it'll drive them nuts.From my perspective, a genuinely entertaining film that has no real conclusion or story."
" After a year of studying this
",0.0,0.9672,2020-10-04 00:00:00,7,"Yes I spent a year studying this film. Upon first watch I figured it was interesting but so loosely plotted that it could have been half as long. However, when you reflect it offers such an interesting and unique perspective and critique of the socio economic climate in the US. This is far from the best film I've watched but it's still good? Good acting"
" 2020
",0.0,0.976,2020-09-25 00:00:00,10,"Just seeing this movie now in 2020. I was looking for movies with Shia & came across it. I loved it and instantly looked up Sasha Lane after the movie was done. She was so beautiful, really a natural beauty and she played her role so well. Her connection with animals was something I think a lot of people missed in the movie! Shia was great as always, and I will now be watching films including Sasha Lane."
" Not a comfortable movie to watch....
",-0.4023,0.9517,2020-08-31 00:00:00,7,But it's well done and I like that it's dialogue was mostly unscripted and most of the actors are real people taken from the streets. It felt like a real dysfunctional road trip with some interesting characters. Pretty raw at times.
" Harsh critics about this movie.. from a 40 something this was pure magic
",-0.6249,0.9717,2020-08-30 00:00:00,9,"There are enough reviews that cut down every aspect, even if there was a minor issue or two I could force out, I wouldn't share it because of that. I turned it on and never took a look away. Riveting look inside the socioeconomic differences that create a lot of the unrest we see today, and in that regard way ahead (4+ years) of it's time on that message.Stirrs memories of relationships made at that age, exlores.the freedom and consequences of that freedom at that age, and I'm sorry but if the love story doesn't tug a bit at you alone, you've missed something in this film, or life itself .100% must see, no question. I came 4 years late to the party, still worth every minute. If your not aware of Shias childhood and issues prior to this stage if this life, check out Honey Boy, and then Peanut Butter Falcon.. amazing success story for an amazingly talented actor, Shia deliveres an enveloping, believable performance that sucks you in to the story and at the end of 2 hours and 45 minutes, I wanted to go back an watch again to see what i may have overlooked the first time."

I did love the character of Star, I feel like the audience missed so much about this wonderful, truly sensitive character.
I had to finish it though, unfortunately it was jumping ahead at 10sec frames just to get to a pointless conclusion."

",0.1779,0.7351,2020-08-10 00:00:00,8,"Well acted, realistic characters, captures middle America malaise with a subtle and thoughtful stroke. Saturated with symbolism and the beauty in every day moments, the movie forces us to examine the ways America and the contemporary condition pushes us to live out contradictions repeatedly. An incredible take on the race to the bottom that is capitalism and the American ethos."
" Trashy Little Movie
",0.0,-0.9361,2020-08-01 00:00:00,6,"6.5 stars rounded down. Some good production and cinematography goes to waste on a mindless plot about drifting aimless youth. They party, do drugs and have sex with other while trying to sell magazines. Nothing gets accomplished and nobody learns anything. Add in petty jealousies and dumb dialogue and there's not much to redeem this movie. Lousy soundtrack too. Avoid."

" Naturalism At Its Finest
",0.0,-0.576,2020-04-24 00:00:00,9,"There is an abundance of lyricism in the road drama, 'American Honey.' Realistic, full depictions of the poor are rare, but when they are realized those depictions are often quite idyllic in that there is tremendous social and sexual freedom in the lowest socioeconomic classes. As with any other group, in Hollywood there are stereotypes of the poor, and many of them are inaccurate. What 'American Honey' does well is it gives incredible nuance and humanity to some marginalized teenagers and young adults. The actors (especially newcomer Sasha Lane) do some incredible work of filling out their characters with an authenticity and vulnerability that is not easily achieved. In achieving this naturalism, perhaps it is no accident that many of the actors were new or virtually new to the screen. With its frequent hand-held shots the film often feels more like a narrator-less documentary. 'Honey' captures the ways those who live in poverty often struggle to make decisions with long'term - or even mid-term - consequences in mind, often moving from responding to one crisis or adventure to another. Yet they are still often able to enjoy the here-and-now and are more quickly able accept marginalized others (racial, sexual minorities, mental health challenges) in ways that their more well-to-do counterparts are unable under the burdens of distraction and social mores. Few TV series or films that I have seen capture the emotional and social realities of poor communities well (the early seasons on the American version of 'Shameless' is another). British director Andrea Arnold illuminates the plight of the American poor without preachiness or sentimentalism. Yet her (and cinemaphotographer Robbie Ryan's) depictions of ventured gestures of affection and connection amidst prosaic tragedies and daily injustices are as beautiful as the shots of the American natural landscape the film contains. Kudos to Andrea Arnold for a non-Hollywood ending, an unhurried pace and uncomplicated weave to a film that deserves every honor it has received."
" Complete waste of time.
",-0.4215,0.881,2020-04-21 00:00:00,1,"This movie is 3 hours of absolutely nothing. There's no real plot aside from a bunch of kids selling magazines, a loose and vague relationship with inconsistent rules for what is and isn't ok, horrible camera work, and over indulgent music montages that add nothing and only serve to flesh out.... nothing. None of the 20 characters are developed at all through the whole movie. Of the 2 things that do happen, there are no consequences. Characters are consistently saying one thing and doing the opposite with no explanation. There's no plot, no character growth, it's not thought provoking in anyway, and all it really manages to do is completely misrepresent today's youth."
" Masterfully made

",-0.5848,-0.6558,2020-04-04 00:00:00,1,"Well, I stuck it out through the first 2 hours looking desperately for some sort of reason to continue watching. Alas, enough was enough. I don't ask for much..a plot...a theme...something.Total waste of time...don't bother."

And unlike Easy Rider, she rides in a van, embraces capitalism and sells magazines...or whatever pays her way. Krystal (Riley Keough) is the boss of these throw-away kids, who in my day would either join a band or end up on Charlie's farm. Kids selling magazines is a lot tamer than making and selling drugs while listening to Hendrix and the Beatles and it makes for a far lamer film. Film quality is about that of a found footage.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Riley Keough, McCaul Lombardi)"

A powerful pasage of time of real america which takes you on a journey of a young girls escaping her hard reality to her dreams of escapism. The movie uses a hybrid of documentary style recorder , independent movie imagery to capture the hard poverty stricken life of Star who bands with a a bunch of misfit young Americans from similar poor and hopeless backgrounds to travel through all parts of America. The soundtack of heavy trap beats pairs well with a movie which hits your nerve to signal what modern day America is for the non-hollywood movie directors who fail to understand their own country."

" US less
",0.0,0.8707,2019-12-17 00:00:00,2,"Despite a largely sympathetic character in Star (played by Sasha Lane), this is way overlong, is unbelievable and doesn't really have anything significant to say.Any film over 90 minutes should only be of that length because it is impossible to cut it down without losing drive/meaning. This is not such a film. Several of the episodes of selling could have been removed without subtracting anything from the overall effect.I struggled to suspend my disbelief. Jake (played by Shia LaBeouf) is supposed to be this Pied Piper sort of character (according to his boss, Krystal, played by Riley Keough) who is there to entice girls to become sellers of magazine subscriptions. But we didn't see anything of anyone being a particularly effective seller and the whole business seemed to be financially implausible.And, finally, this doesn't have anything significant to say. OK, perhaps all these kids have had challenging starts in life, but this seems to suggest it's OK to abuse ""the kindness of strangers"" and that there is no personal cost to such immorality."
" The Director Loved the Script
",0.5994,-0.9432,2019-12-11 00:00:00,1,"This 163 minute epic highlights the need for a good producer and editor. When the director writes the screenplay, there is a loss of objectivity and the director is reluctant to cut one line from the masterpiece that they have written. This applies to the editing too. A good producer would question such a long self-indulgent running time for a pretentious little film with a flimsy to non-existent narrative. Eighty minutes would have stretched the patience of the average viewer of this drivel, but at it 163 minutes it is a test of masochistic endurance. Obnoxious characters speaking moronic dialogue in a vague criticism of Capitalism and the American Dream obviously appeals to pseudo-intellectual right-on critics, but its entertainment value is somewhat less than watching iron rust. This garbage will only appeal to simple-minded viewers who can relate to the characters and pretentious critics eager to hail another film 'auteur' who abhors the idea of a film with any commercial potential.."

Watched the trailer in theaters and instantly hated it because of the new age hip hop soundtrack. That's probably why it took me so long to sit down and watch it. Noticed it on Netflix and decided to give it a chance. I'm pretty sure the casting director walked down Hollywood Blvd and auditioned any squatter they could find. If Shia wasn't in this film. I never would of gave it a chance. The main actress was great and the story was actually pretty good. Kinda didn't go anywhere but I still liked it. The soundtrack made me cringe tho. Who composed this movie? Migos? Sounded like they picked the trap rap station on Pandora for the playlist. Movie would of been a lot better and not as long if they would of just cut those scenes out. At least Cardi B wasn't relevant during the filming. I'm sure a few of her songs would of been featured. Thank god for that.

" On The Road for the 2010's
",0.0,0.9757,2019-11-22 00:00:00,10,"I know I am in the minority on this point but even at nearly 3 hours I thought this film was too short. Do not get me wrong the storyline is fully developed and the characters resonant. But the atmosphere, the monotony of Star's life and the ebb and flow of growing up provides a wonderful mood and hypnotic spell. This is a slice of life film that rings completely true and it provides a pensive look at the frayed edges of our society.I think what I appreciate the most the film is the naturalism of how the sex is depicted. There is no sensationalism present and the director does a really good job of capturing the tender awkwardness of young sexuality. Much credit must be given to Lane who in her first performance delivers a complex turn that feels completely right.This is a startling film from start to finish."
" endless!
",0.0,0.9357,2019-11-15 00:00:00,2,"This movie is over two hours long. While the story is meant to be a love story, it is a tedious exercise. The lead female is an unlikable, self-centered loser. The lead guy is a little more likable, but not by much. There really is nothing here as far a plot. The two leads are attracted to each other. The male lead is in a quasi-relationship with someone else. There is a little jealousy. The leads flirt and occasionally engage in a physical relationship. There is a crew of young people who ride around in a van with them, drink and sell magazines. The ""love story"" is told in this context. My goodness! This story could have been told more effectively in 90-100 minutes. The scenes get to be repetitive. What was the director thinking? You will disappointed if you see this one through to the end!"

",0.4588,0.3378,2019-08-17 00:00:00,6,"American Honey is a film about the bottom of the American dream. A bottom that it emblematic of the entire dream itself. Where the poorest of society try to make by, in an economy that has left them behind. Andrea Arnold fascinatingly shows characters reaching for hope in a situation they know is hopeless. Star, our main character, comes for the ride out of loneliness and longing for a family of her own, despite the fact that to stay apart of this family, she frequently debases herself. What we see in the micro, is reflective of what many people feel in the macro. Even though we the viewers aren't unfortunate enough to understand Star's plight, we know to a certain extent what it means to sell yourself short in order to get what you want.Great performances from Sasha Lane and Shia LaBeouf. As a whole, American Honey is fascinating, but overlong and meandering. Many sequences could have been cut. We could have done without the two unnecessary sex scenes between Star and Jake, which if anything, pads this film out to nearly 3 hours. Worth at least one watch."

This is the type of movie that will make you think about life and see life from from a different perspective. Not everyone will be able to relate or understand this movie and that's okay.

",-0.4404,-0.9023,2019-06-26 00:00:00,1,Horrible movie. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened throughout the entire movie. If you want to watch a bunch of trash nuggets sing songs in a van then watch this movie. I felt like I watched nearly 3 hours of kids singing songs. And they weren't even good songs. What a waste of time. I can't even see how someone would call this movie artistic. The only draw this movie has is watching a train wreck happen right in front you face. Sometimes it's hard to take your eyes off of the train wreck.

If strictly analyzing this film for hitting the beats, delivering clear themes, take aways, pushing the boundaries of writers table paradigms, yeah I can see the 1 star rating.
Connection to a story is subjective.
But if I'm watching a movie, it's usually to escape reality for a moment.
I found myself not seeking out the analysis while watching but simply riding along in the van.
I lived out a chapter of someone else's life. Someone completely different than myself.
And to me, to be completely pulled into a story and world is something a billion dollar production like avengers couldn't do with it's Hollywood quips and polished CGI everything.
Those moves may entertain me.
But this movie made me feel and search.
Like life, you don't always get clear themed and empty platitudes. Sometimes you just have reality and it shapes you, with or without a recognizable point."
" A Pointless Movie

" Terribly Disappointed

I think the movie started off very interesting and took an ""in your face"" approach. The movie moved very quickly at the beginning but quickly slowed to such a pace I had to start to fast forward just to get through it. I think if the movie had kept its original speed it would have been far more entertaining."

" Shia and Riley Carry The Film
",0.0,0.9868,2019-06-01 00:00:00,7,"I'm three years late. But this movie proved to me why Shia Labeouf is and will always be a great actor. Riley Keough, too (though this is the first time I've seen her). Those two characters made the film for me.I like Sasha lane. However, I think that the movie is carried by her love story with Shia's character. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't care about her because she seems a little too naive and temperamental for her own good. Such as when she continuously hops in cars with strange men (which is the whole plot of this film tbh) and constantly has a temper in an environment where maybe keeping her cool would be the better option. (Especially when she chose to be there in the first place).The other side characters feel like real life people I would see from my generation. The fact that the film cast actual people rather than actors shows. But in a good way. It makes the film feel like it is a ""ride along"" rather than a movie.If it wasn't for the random, ""why is this here?"" artistic shots (like a grasshopper on Sasha's character's arm)...well, I feel like this was like being a fly on a wall in this particular place and people of the world.

Some of the scenery, and cinematography was well done, but overall what a disgusting mess. I felt like I wanted to shower throughout the entire film.
Wife, and I did laugh throughout at how bad it was, and asked out loud several times why were watching. Both wondering what the point of the movie was, surely there was some twist ahead, something that wrapped at least a small part of this weirdness up.*Spoiler alert*There isn't."

",0.0,0.8929,2019-05-21 00:00:00,1,"So, you know the story about the guy that put his glasses on the ground at an art exhibit and everyone gathered around taking pictures of it because they thought it was a part of a profound art installation, when really the guy was just setting his glasses down? I feel like that's a pretty good description of this movie. Inanely pretentious and making itself to be something it really isn't. I mean, really the very first scene features Shia La Beef dancing for a girl he's never met in a run-down, dirty Kmart to Rihanna's ""We Found Love (In a Hopeless Place)"". I mean, can you get any more on the nose? And don't try to save it by thinking it's some kind of meta-commentary, because it's not that deep. It's just hot garbage. Perhaps my attitude is a bit too ""hey you kids, stay off my lawn"" for this type of movie, but I couldn't make it through the first hour. The characters are unlikable, the plot is non-existent, and you feel like you're constantly being bombarded by an attitude of ""LOOK AT ME! LOOK HOW EDGY AND GRITTY AND ARTSY I AM!"" from the movie itself. Your time would be much better spent on a movie that's less full of itself."

In my opinion if you watch this just for pleasure, you will enjoy the ride. The acting is so real, cinematography is great and also both lead actors. The plot is... there is not a real plot so just try to understand the message, try to be openminded and consequently try to love something different. This is not Twilight."

",0.0,-0.0387,2019-05-16 00:00:00,7,"The movie strives in communicating positive vibes through the crowd of young actors that star in it. However, it fails in going deep enough in exploring the complexity of each character.

We finish the film with the satisfaction of a good movie but the regret of what it could have been."
" Just not very good
",-0.3865,0.7964,2019-05-13 00:00:00,5,"I don't need a film to have a definite story, or fully formed characters, but I need it to be more than LCD reality level stuff. This missed the mark and if it wasn't for the cinematography, warm hues that made everything feel like it was in slow motion, would have happily given it a 1 or 2. Life on the road for kids from poverty isn't meant to be idyllic or have happy endings, but as a filmmaker, you have to give a little more than the base mentality and the dullness of repetitive scenario's. While I appreciate the naked potrayal of youth from down and out situations, you can't make them all out to be cutthroat carnies looking for cheap thrills. Ultimately, it was boring, and other than 2 scenes not worth it."

I normally try and see things from other people's view point but in this case they can't. I understand that their is a lack of strong narrative compared to its older sister Fish Tank, and that film had a near neo-western show down at the end where as this miranders off into oblivion, (just like life) especially if you haven't been paying attention to the subtle use of animal symbolism during the flick. But this film is pure cinema. There is a drug like quality oozing out of every frame that belts you into a journey of confusion, awakening, heart brake and joy. It is the journey of a teenage girl running along side the metaphor of a gang of travelling sales people. Star (the star) is played by the perfectly chosen Sasha Lane who although not having ANY acting experience is holding her own against the madness of the modern master Shai. I'm a 37 year old garbage man and I've never related to a character more lol. That achievement lies fairly in the direction. Not a finer film you will see."

One of the cases when the author doesn't have a clue how to end its story and just lets it die on its own. A pitty."

" Worth Three Hours
",0.2263,0.9565,2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"American Honey is like Requiem for a Dream and Blue Valentine had a less mature baby. At base value, American Honey is sort of an angsty, slow story about young love. But dig a little deeper and it's actually a heartbreaking story of deceit and misfortune that develops nicely. There's this constant theme on needing to save life no matter how insignificant or lost that life is and I love that. This movie has a little bit of everything: crime, manipulation, sex, and even a a hint of romance. I didn't think I'd like American Honey as much as I did, but I strongly recommend watching it. Fair warning, I wouldn't say this is the happiest story on the planet."
" Irritating
",-0.4588,0.9612,2018-11-29 00:00:00,5,"My main problem with this movie is that there were no characters I really cared about. The main character is naive, stupid, temperamental, hypocritical and pouty beyond belief. Not that I think she deserved a lot of what happened and I do get her background, but she and everyone else in this movie was close to unbearable to watch for me.Cinematography is great though, the actors' performances are great, and at its best moments it's still interesting to follow the happenings of this group of young people."

" Excellent character study on overcoming life's given obstacles
",0.2732,0.9719,2018-09-16 00:00:00,9,"I was at first put off on watching this film because of the trailer which grossly misrepresents this great movie as a sappy romance. It is volumes above and beyond that stereotype, and really does not do the movie any justice. The film centers on a beautiful young 18 year old girl living in a hopelessly dreary home caring for the two younger kids of her drunken, worthless boyfriend. After a day of dumpster diving to bring home some food, a traveling van full of teens her age crosses her path. Intrigued, she follows them into a department store where she encounters Jake, the hiring manager. Sparks fly as he attempts to convince her to join them. Reluctantly, she runs away with them. Right from the beginning, Star is clearly not like the others in the caravan. Despite coming from similar backgrounds, she seems to be both surprised and thrilled by their wildness, yet never gives into their immature behaviors. The secondary characters seem to be non-actors playing themselves as they roll across the country leading a life which must only be marginally better than the oppressed homes they came from.The boss lady, Krystal, seems to size Star up right away, seeing she is not in it just for kicks but more to obtain the attention of Jake. Nevertheless, she recognizes Star's looks have high earning potential so she allows her in. From that point on, Star and Jake begin a strained affair that seems impossible to succeed in the environment they are placed.Krystal sees right away that Star is a complicated character that is far more sophisticated on an intelligence level than the others, and clearly does not need to sell magazines to earn money. Yet it is Jake that keeps her wanting to stick around, but never quite gives her his all, and even seems to bring her down at times. Shia LeBeouf is outstanding from the start, totally convincing in every way as the cocky leader who isn't quite as sure of himself as he appears. Sasha Lane is also well cast as a naive beauty that somehow knows there is much more to life than what she's experienced so far.The film has many symbolic, dreamy qualities, mostly in the scenes where Jake and Star are able to sneak away and be alone, away from the gritty ugliness of the lives they lead. The music backdrop evokes the emotions of the moment, whether they are being transported to the next destination, seeking a drunken refuge, or being caught in the moment of their infatuation with each other.As far as story plausibility that some users expressed doubt, door to door magazine sales have been around for many decades. The fabricated stories they use to evoke sympathy from potential buyers in the movie are absolutely dead on. Its not about the magazines so much as the sob story the sales person tries to push. I don't know how anyone over the age of 25 could have not encountered these scammers at some point in their lives. The story meanders through various situations that the couple can't seem to overcome. They always seem to find themselves back where they started. It's only our hopes for Star that keeps us going."
" Another great feature from Andrea Arnold
",0.6249,-0.9685,2018-09-12 00:00:00,10,"American Honey is the granddaughter of Thelma and Louise -- a road journey with classic mythic structure which follows the coming-of-age (or not) of an 18-year-old named Star. Star comes from a tough background -- the classic orphaned underdog, with a mother who has overdosed, and an auntie(?) who requires Star to look after her young kids rather than looking after Star, who definitely needs protection, from the abusive guy she's got hanging around.It's inevitable that a disenfranchised kid like Star will fall into bad company, because most any company is better than what she's starting out with. Bad company rolls into town as a band of magazine hawking troubadours, with a subculture reminiscent of Lord of the Flies.Freshly free of childcare responsibilities, we now get to see the childlike side of Star, who isn't ready for the world of work, even if that work is pretty dodgy. She plays the fool, gets high, and doesn't know a violent man when she sees one. If he promises her 'a present', she's putty in his hands. This movie is basically a love story -- or can we call it that? Like Fish Tank, this is the story of an emotionally neglected teenage girl falling in with a bad older man, then finally making her escape, or not.The film employs only a couple of professional actors -- the rest are amateurs recruited from carnivals and suchlike, but you wouldn't know it. This feels like cinema verite. You really feel like you're in the bus with these people, for better or for worse. If you've ever been on a bus trip, to summer camp, stayed in a hostel, flatted, or partied, you'll get this. There's commentary about rich and poor in America as the bus travels from mega wealthy to poverty stricken areas, where the problems look different. When Star visits a house of neglected children we're given closeups of photos pasted without frames to the wall, a near empty fridge, Mountain Dew. This could be Star's own house. She's missing her little cousins and though she's far from 'home', she's come full circle. Even the mother is familiar -- like these little kids, she grew up with a mother addicted to meth. This is the beginning of her epiphany, though we never get to see what that epiphany is. Maybe she realises this is her entire lot in life, which is why she buys food for these strangers with her sex work money. Or maybe she realises she can use situations like these as a negative example, and start planning to get out of it.The ending is left open for the viewer to extrapolate. Jake gives Star the turtle and she sets the turtle free. Then she joins the turtle in the water. One interpretation: Star is now free like the turtle, having experienced a revelation. Meanwhile, the others dance over a fire to Raury's tribalistic anthem 'God's Whisper'. If that's not religious imagery of rebirth, I don't know what is. Then again, Star has given away Jake's (stolen ring) present before -- is this the part where Star finally sees this violent, coercively controlling man for what he is? Maybe. But if she doesn't see it now, she never will. For us, Star's journey ends here. For all we know, this young woman could keep traveling these American highways forever, trapped in a hot bus with a bad man and a stifling, drug-addled rag-tag crew who don't seem to see abuse when it's right in front of them. This is the water they swim in, and this is how abuse works. Streetwise matriarch Krystal does see it, but she's toxic and ignores it. She may even revel in watching it play out, accepting the abuser back when she promised his victim he was gone. Why do girls fall for these guys? Many outsiders have wondered that. Star's journey in American Honey affords us a view of destructive attraction from the inside. We should now be left with a little insight for how these things work, and empathy for the girls involved."
" THEY GROW UP QUICK DON'T THEY...?
",0.0,0.7184,2018-09-08 00:00:00,8,"Sort of like Kids on tour, Honey tells the story of a disaffected girl, who stays at home taking care of her younger siblings while the adults are out playing, is picked by a wandering band of magazine subscription selling teens led by Shia LeBouf & Riley Keough to join their particular brand of circus. Made by Andrea Arnold who did a fascinating take on Wuthering Heights a few years ago, captures the ennui & aimlessness that is today's millennials who are as quick to have an opinion on everything as they are to partake in drink & drugs. At almost 3 hours long, this film never feels long or unwelcome but one feels a return film to catch up on our lead every few years ala the 28 Up series could be compelling."
" Could have been so much better
",0.4902,0.9354,2018-07-15 00:00:00,6,"Both the critics and supporters of this movie have valid points. 
The Good > There's definitely an artistic element to the script which is played out quite nicely for a while. Much too long? - yes - But the statement was there. Secondly, the cast does an excellent job selling it with well received acting. Several individually nice performances throughout the movie save it from being a waste for me.
The Bad > The length is completely and utterly unnecessary. There is so much repeating of the same concepts and dialogs that an hour could have cut without any affect on outcome or presentation. Way too many scenes were deja vu.
The Awful > Worst music selection humanly possible save a couple songs. I mean seriously.....if we're stuck watching repetitive scenes of youth listening and singing along with music while riding down the highway in a van at least choose some real music. Editing out 1/2 of those monotonous scenes would have cranked out a couple more stars from this viewer. Good Luck with this one. For what it's worth, I can say I don't regret watching it."
" 2 hours and 43 minutes that feel like 6 hours
",0.3612,0.8226,2018-07-14 00:00:00,1,"If you know only one thing going into this movie, please understand it is 2 hours and 43 minutes long. I didn't know that but did feel I was sitting there for 5 or 6 hours. There are many one star reviews for this movie and they are all telling the truth, it's awful. I would like to break it down some beyond the obvious excuse ""It's painfully boring"". There really aren't any spoilers either as it has no real plot. 
REASON TO SEE THIS MOVIE........
You love Sasha Lane and want to see her eyes, lips and body for many hours, in close-up. really it feels like eternity. I never have to see another movie with her in it ever again.
REASONS TO AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE........
Shia Lebeouf with an ugly clip-on braid (if it's real , well it looks fake) playing a white trash grifter. the part is poorly written and while normally I think he's a good actor he is awful in this.
ENDLESS scenes of supposedly very poor kids in a van singing or dancing to music, and I mean endless, and if they're not in the van they're dancing or rough-housing to music. Forget dialogue, lets' just show them riding in the van, over and over and over and over and over and over.............
No plot
A not very believable love story, it's a stretch to even call it that.
Sacha's lead character Star is one more unrealistic , only-in-the-movies grifter, but with a heart of gold. yeah right !
While this movie is perfectly cast, except for Shia, and many of the actors shine in their roles, they have little screen time. I love Riley Keough and she is great with what's she's given to work with here. A one note role that is only minor. She shows up it seems only to be nasty to Star.
The people behind this probably thought they were creating something realistic and gritty. I know people like this personally and life is not all singing and dancing for them. Watching this is like watching a nearly 3 hour commercial for hipster clothing and bad music. I won't even get into whatever message it's trying to send, it's enough to say that in this movie the ugly people are anyone with money or a job. The scenes that attempt to show the seedier sides of life are completely unrealistic. The running time alone for a movie with no plot that concentrates 99% of it's time on only 1 poorly written, uninteresting character is overindulgence to the extreme."
" Literally wasted three hours of my life watching this
",-0.4939,-0.9896,2018-06-16 00:00:00,1,"This movie is looooong! And also an improbable mishmash of condescending stereotypes and unlikely/unbelievable situations. To start off, the ending is stupid. She baptized herself? She wanted to be with the turtle she released? Made no sense at all. The entire movie is a mish mash of scenes that do not track with other scenes, so it isn't actually a movie in the normal sense, as there is no real story.I wanted to watch it to see how they portrayed the traveling magazine sales crews. Those were a real thing in the 1980's. I had friends who joined these groups with varying amounts of success and almost all of them said they were wild. I would find it very hard to believe that anyone would bother selling magazine subscriptions in this way today.If you are from the South be ready for an insulting portrayal of you, your families and where you live or grew up. Since you should already know that you (Southerners) are stupid, evil, hypocritical, racist, drug-addicted inbreeders then you won't mind being reminded of this. The beginning of the movie clearly demonstrates that Christians are heartless hypocrites and Southern women are the worst kind of baby-making trash.I expected better of Riley Keough. Her grandfather is from the South yet she helps perpetuate racist stereotypes.As for improbable situations, there is a scene where ""Star"" is walking near a refinery and steps in blood? Oil? Industrial waste? It looked more like transmission fluid, but having worked in a refinery I know that this hasn't happened in the U.S. of A in this century or the last half of the previous century. There is so much oversight in the US petroleum industry that even the smallest release of product on the ground is a big deal. They certainly don't dump hundreds or thousands of gallons of oil/waste 50 yards from the front gate. Stupid scene.The scene where Shia finds Star after she left with the three cowboys was completely non-sensical. She and Shia were walking and the cowboys picked her up in a Cadillac. Somehow, after they drove with her for awhile and go to one of the men's house in a rural community, Shia shows up in the man's back yard shooting his gun and steals their car, taking Star with him. Of course, there are no consequences for the many felonies committed in the scene because they completely get away by driving relatively slowly down the rural road in the stolen white convertible Cadillac and they even stop to have sex not far down the road. Of course there would be no police in the entire state responding to a shots fired home invasion.To say that this show is nonsensical is being generous. Literally have no idea what the point of this story is or was supposed to be. It almost seems like someone edited the film without consulting the script, because there are scenes that look like they were mistakenly put in or at least in the wrong place, like when the girls/female transgenders are urinating on the mountain in the sunrise. That scene literally was out of place and made no sense at all."
" Superficial film

" Boring story can't overcome good acting.
",-0.5727,-0.8677,2018-05-11 00:00:00,2,"I hated this movie because Sasha Lane's acting was good enough to keep me watching in the hope that the boring story would eventually turn into something interesting but, sadly, it simply ended in the middle of yet another tedious scene. Nothing is resolved, no one learns anything. There's barely a plot at all. If the point of the movie was to represent the drab existence of poor southern kids without making any particular point about it, then it could have been summed up much faster than the 2.75 hours it took. The scenes that should have led to something interesting were just abandoned with no followup. Why did the film open with her in a relationship and watching his 2 kids. This was quickly abandoned and had nothing to do with the rest of the film. Were there no repercussions to Jake shooting up the patio of 3 men and stealing their car? And how did he even get there so fast without a car? Why did he have blood on him immediately after Star returned from her date with the man in the truck? Why were such scenes put in the movie if they had nothing to do with anything else in the film? Why were there so many excruciating scenes with the small talk and music going on as they all rode in the van? Was there a rule that the film could not be less than 2 hours and 43 minutes? The only redeeming aspect is the realistic acting of Sasha Lane. It feels like you're watching a documentary as she never appears to be acting. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for her costars. Shia LaBeouf is always over the top. And until this film, I've always been amazed with Riley Keough's acting. She can sell a line with her eyes, a twist of her head or an inflection in her voice. But not this time. While Sasha Lane never seemed to be acting, Riley Keough delivers every line as though she's an actress delivering her lines. This was way below her usual high standard. My advice would be to watch for no more than 20 minutes just to appreciate Ms. Lane's acting. Once you get that, you can turn it off and not miss a thing."

Many road movies in the past have felt with these questions and they've turned out better than this. Did you really expect this to be better than Stand By Me?The centre of it all is Star. She's the less attractive version of Chloe-Grace Moretz. She lives in a dysfunctional family in Oklahoma and wants to get away from it all. The look that we get into her home life is brief, but enough for us to wish her hit the road. She sees a group of rebellious teens rip up a K-Mart and gets info about their next stops. The dude that charms her and informs her is Jake, played by Shia LaBeouf. He's cool, cocky, charming, and has a dumb ponytail. His crew sells magazines door-to-door. Since the internet steals business and there's a plethora of magazines at candy stores, the crew barely makes any money. Just enough for gas, food, and motels. Her first destination is Kansas City. After that, it's to wherever else.American Honey is an episodic look at life on the road. At each town and each pitch, the viewer becomes fully invested. Will Star screw up? Will any of the crew members get in trouble? There's fun and heartbreak. She falls for Jake almost immediately. She loves his attitude and not taking any crap. She likes the other members and their wild nature, with the only exception being Krystal--the head of the operation. Star isn't cut out for being a door-to-door saleslady, going cross-country and encountering people from all walks of life is helping her grow into a mature woman.American Honey takes a wonderful look at young lost souls. They're disconnected from society. These people are going nowhere. Their world is a minivan that travels from place to place. Along the way are beautiful shots and images of the good ole' US of A. There isn't much of a revelation and the ending is pretty open-ended, but that's not a takeaway from the experience we had with Star.One of the best things about American Honey is its filmmaking. This is such an immersive film that makes the experience all-the-more special. The aspect ratio is a little odd for an American epic, but that adds to the intimacy and authenticity. There is lots of symbolic shots and motifs (such as a melting turkey) and the movie takes full advantage of the unspoken word. This is an art-house film, but that doesn't mean it is made any worse than something big-budgeted. In fact, this was one of the best created films this year.This is a movie to see more than once. Get to know what kind of movie this is, and prepare yourself for the ride of your life.4/4"

I couldn't have said it better myself. There is nothing like watching a film which involves scenarios that I've never had to deal with. In that way, there's a keen sense of truth and honesty to the story. None of the actors feel like they're acting, which is one of the greatest compliments an actor can be given. Everyone has chemistry and everyone looks like they're enjoying what they're doing. So even though I can't outright say I relate to any of the characters, I can appreciate watching people do what they have to do to survive. At almost 165 minutes, American Honey is a long watch, and can be difficult when the plot seems to lead nowhere, but I'll always consider a new experience a worthy experience. And certainly spending time with a dozen magazine salesmen and women who travel the country and scam people to stay alive is a new experience. Long but inevitably inspiring, American Honey is one of the more unique films you'll see.7.3/10"
" A Phenomenal Film!
",0.0,0.9964,2017-08-13 00:00:00,9,"Indie Movies seem to be unstoppable off late. And in that rich list of films, 'American Honey' stands tall. This Drama/Road Film takes a piece out of you, due to its honesty & relentless spirit. And Lead Star Sasha Lane makes a heroic debut!'American Honey' Synopsis: A teenage girl (Sasha Lane) with nothing to lose joins a traveling magazine sales crew, and gets caught up in a whirlwind of hard partying, law bending and young love as she criss-crosses the Midwest with a band of misfits.'American Honey' is a harrowing tale on life & circumstances. We watch Star, the protagonist, struggle & embrace life with her uproarious courage & heartbreaking realism. I found myself stuck on to the seat at all times, engrossed & heartbroken with this story's heavy themes. 'American Honey' explores poverty with gut wrenching honesty & exposes of how ""The Great American Dream"" isn't for all. Even the character of Jake (Shia LaBeouf) is a victim of circumstances & is shoved down by the limited opportunities he's given. Its a relentless tale, the travels through America as we know it & offers a disturbing, yet truthful depiction of life is for some, despite their ambitions to fly. This isn't an easy film to stomach, but that doesn't mean it won't give you goose- flesh! Its right at your face, unapologetically. Andrea Arnold is in top-form as a Writer & Director. 'American Honey' is strongly written & very strongly directed as well. The Screenplay deftly captures the souls of its wandering characters & constructs a strong narrative. The Writing is dark & disturbing, but arresting at all times, as well. Arnold's Direction is terrific. She captures this human story with a with utmost honesty & conviction. Its a SHAME that 'American Honey' wasn't given its due by the Awards this year. Robbie Ryan's Cinematography captures American, skillfully. Joe Bini's Editing is crisp, despite its 163-minutes running-time. Art & Costume Design are natural.Performance-Wise: Sasha Lane is a show stopper. As Star, the conflicted protagonist, the debutant delivers a knockout performance that leads 'American Honey'. She's practically in every frame & not a second, does she falter. And lets not forget to mention that looks absolutely gorgeous! This is a Star-Making Performance, that needs to be seen. Again, were the guys at the Awards this year sleeping? Shia LaBeouf returns to fine form after a long time. And its indeed nice to see the actor portray his part with such commitment. Riley Keough is sensational in a strong, supporting role. Arielle Holmes is first- rate. Others lend great support.On the whole, 'American Honey' is a Masterstroke! Don't Miss It."

" The Cannes Jury Prize? Seriously?
",0.4515,0.9733,2017-07-30 00:00:00,2,"I just don't get it.I honestly cannot remember the last time I was this baffled over the Grand-Canyon-sized gap between a movie's rave reviews and my own experience viewing it. Granted, the on-the-road scenery was pretty to look at, but everything else was so laughably bad. Not one character, event, or line of dialogue rang true, and there were points where I actually felt insulted by being expected to believe what was happening on screen. Here are my major complaints: Say what you will about Shia LaBeouf - at least he demonstrates an ability to convey different emotions through facial expressions and vocal inflections. That's kind of an important quality for an actor. Unfortunately Sasha Lane didn't get that memo. The movie was nearly three hours long, and I can count on one hand the number of times her facial expression changed. Casting a block of wood as Star would have been a more economical choice, with virtually identical results.Here's how the adventure begins: Star is walking along the street, she sees a guy pressing his buttcheeks against the window of a passing van, and BOOM, she's instantly drawn into following them. That's supposed to be a believable precipitating incident? She's entranced by buttcheeks in a moving car? The character Crystal actually says the film's title on screen within the first 15 minutes. The only way it could have been more on-the-nose is if she looked directly into the camera and winked.Would it have KILLED Andrea Arnold to do some research on what it's actually like to work a door-to-door job? As someone who's worked as a canvasser, I can unequivocally say that not one magazine-selling interaction in this movie was remotely believable. According to this movie, people just LOVE when strange youngsters interrupt their day to show up on their property (dressed like total slobs in this case), selling them things they don't want and didn't ask for... especially rich people! They'll always invite you right in, and never assume you're about to rob them or case their home for a burglary! They're fine with you copping an attitude and talking back to them when you're inside their home!They'd love it if you appear out of nowhere and start following them up their driveway! They'd be totally cool with you playing around with their outdoor decor right in front of their faces! Most of all, they'd certainly never call the cops on you, not even if you're smoking weed or brandishing a deadly weapon on the sidewalk in broad daylight! Yep.I'll just give one specific example of one of the many non-reality-based scenes in the movie: So, Star is picked up by a car full of older cowboy types and brought to their house for a barbecue. Total strangers pick up some random girl they've never met, and just bring her right into their home to hang out (with no obvious ulterior motive). This was completely ridiculous, but as soon as Jake shows up with his gun to steal the car, it was catapulted to outright absurd. I mean, come on... a group of older caucasian gentlemen in middle America who are all wearing matching white cowboy hats - these are the kinds of dudes who probably keep a gun next to the toilet ""just in case."" In what alternate universe would they have NOT been packing heat, and NOT have shot Jake dead in a nanosecond? There were probably 100 more believable ways that this scene could have played out, but the one that actually happens just left me shaking my head.There were multiple parts where we could have seen the character depth/development that was so sorely lacking from this movie, but it was just one missed opportunity after another. Take the scene where Jake shows Star all the jewelry he's been ""collecting"" (i.e. stealing) over the years. This could have very easily been a catalyst for an argument between the characters about morals, or economic inequality, or the American value of ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps,"" which would have been a perfect way to actually build the characters and make them seem like real people. Instead, there was nothing. It's difficult to feel invested in bland, unsympathetic characters in a movie that doesn't give you one good reason to care about them.I was waiting for the whole ""Star getting into cars with strange men"" motif to take a scary turn, which would have been super predictable but at least interesting. It never did. Not once. This isn't just unrealistic - it makes for an unbelievably boring movie. Again, so much potential for character development/conflict/new lessons learned, but every opportunity was completely wasted.While we're on the car thing: Okay, Star is constantly jumping into vehicles with strangers, including an actual trucker who says he's running late... and then once the particular scene is over, she's magically back with her group of sales associates all hunky dory. HOW DID SHE KEEP GETTING BACK TO THE GROUP??? What exactly was the point of this movie? What conflicts were resolved? What did the characters learn? How did they change or grow? To reiterate my original point, I just. Do. Not. Get it.If you disliked this movie as much as I did, check out Tina Hassannia's review of it in Canada's National Post. You'll feel less alone."

We rented this movie, as DH thought it would be good- sales, marketing, hopefully wolf of wall street type wheeling and dealing, but showing young adults. Heck- I would of even settled for a decent plot. But was I was left with was some big school art student filming, directing and writing this junk. Girl runs off with a group of people who party in cheap hotels, drink and get busy.Horrible acting and fighting like their 8th graders. I couldn't finish it- I looked at my watch every 10 minutes, DH said give it some time, it may turn out better. It didn't, it only progressively got worse- with no plot being followed, and me asking, ""So, when is something cool going to happen?"". Just think of what an unsupervised kid would do on a trip- there's your movie. No laughing, no- ""oh my this is thrilling"", no suspense, drama, etc.I rather do hard labor, or cut my lawns grass with scissors- than attempt to finish this movie, or watch it again."
" Okay if you can get past the editing, but not a must see
",0.1154,-0.9822,2017-07-11 00:00:00,3,"There's a lot to like about this movie: good performances, with a standout from Sasha Lane, some beautiful shots and direction, a relatable cast of disenfranchised characters that will remind you of at least three people you've known (probably), and a tidy though very sanitised evocation of life on the road.Unfortunately, there's also a lot to really dislike. A bloated run time, self-indulgent pacing, incessant shaky cam and jump cuts that are jarring, irritating, and totally unnecessary, plus holes in the premise and plot (or lack of one; this isn't really a linear movie) that you could drive a white minivan through. The characters are likable enough as an ensemble - their easy rapport and the games they play to have fun on the road will, depending on the viewer, make you feel nostalgic, wishful, or possibly just confused - but sadly the movie wants to spend more time on Jake (Shia LaBeouf), the romantic interest of unbelievably naive and mushy- willed protagonist Star (Sasha Lane). Not only is he very dull and unlikeable as a character, but his introduction as a master salesman just is blatantly false, and LaBeouf shambles and mumbles his way through the dialogue without a trace of charisma, doing nothing to suggest Jake has any kind of hidden depth. Of course, part of the point of the movie is (presumably) its cyclical repetitiveness and lack of forward momentum - this is a world and an environment where there is no real change or prospect of improvement - but for all its messages about the fracturing of the American Dream, there's a strange dearth of realism in American Honey when it comes to poverty, abuse, or crime. The whole movie feels more like a sun- kissed daydream of what it is to let go of responsibilities and still not find freedom, and the promise of any satisfying conclusion to the narrative remains frustratingly out of reach. Ultimately, this is an unsatisfying mess of a movie that falls short of making any real statement or analysis, and left me with the uncomfortable sensation that the characters, their struggles, and their ignorance of the world they're not really part of were all there for the audience to gawk at instead of identify with."

I love a great drama like Rachel's Wedding, Juno or Little Miss Sunshine etc. The hand held camera and the way it's used shooting from behind the kids and to the side. The realism is spectacular. I felt as though i was taking the road trip in the car with them and reminds me a bit of the days when i tried selling encyclopedias and art and writing courses to people who could ill afford them. Also, reminds me of the times those guys came to my door trying to sell me magazines lying to me to try to make a living when it's so much easier to 'get a real job' but, perhaps, not for the folks portrayed in the flick. The 'characters' and the actions of everyone couldn't have been done better. The length of time i had to take this journey was perfect for me. I watched 1/2 one night and the other half the following night so i was spared any feeling of samo samo. The flick brings you right into the feelings and happenings of being there. Very good show."

It may have had something to do with the sure to be gritty subject matter or the challenging running time of 2 hr 43 mins. The film did feel long, I had to watch it in two halves, but I don't think it suffered for it. Andrea Arnold has an almost unique talent of immersing her audience totally into the reality of her characters, I felt like I was living alongside Star (played mesmerisingly by Sasha Lane). The hand-held camera work is certainly a part of this, often focussing on small details like fireflies in the sky or red juice leaking out of an out of date bag of chicken. Long stretches of dialogue between the amateur actors in quiet moments and extended plays of rap music with the characters singing along are also contributing factors. But I think it's the outstanding performances she teases from her stars: Sasha Lane, Shia La Beouf and Riley Keough; the audience feels their anger, hurt, mistrust and lust keenly alongside them. American Honey is another triumph for Andrea Arnold with her proving her expertise in serving up an authentic, absorbing and gritty slice of underprivileged life just as well on the other side of the pond."

The language was absolutely horrendous. The main character leaves one hell only to enter another. I turned off the sound as I can't stand so much cursing, just to give it a chance. Then the other forms of trash arose, making me use the fast-forward function. Each and every scene I observed surpassed the other in its complete nothingness. I even researched the ending to try and find something good about the film... Spoiler-- you can watch five minutes of the film at the beginning fast-forward to the end and you missed nothing!!! All you've done is wasted ten minutes rather than nearly 3 Hours of your life!!! I've read many deep thoughts of the true meaning of the gift and of her going into the water...Spoiler alert they are high and partying the entire time, complete devoid of sense. The turtle means nothing, her swimming means nothing, She's still living in an insanely ridiculous lifestyle devoid of hope and joy. I feel like anyone struggling with addiction should literally not watch this film, it is so stressful and insane it will drive you to want to drink and get high. Do not watch if you struggle with addiction find something better! I have read of the torture of waterboarding, I feel this movie could be used as a form of torture... it could drive someone to confess to a crime they didn't commit just to get you to turn the thing off! All the good and deep reviews must be from those involved in the film, related to someone in the film, or supporters of legalizing all drugs. Finally why does it deserve a rating of 1.... it does not! There should be a negative rating now as that is what it deserves a rating if -10."

At times it's repetitive, borderline manipulative or indulgent. (I still don't know that it's 2 hour 43 minute running time is really justified or necessary). It also felt less rooted in complex ideas and themes than Arnold's earlier work. It may be partly a problem of expectation. On first viewing I kept expecting more connected plot elements in what is much more a truly tonal, poetic film. The second time around I just let the film's images, performances and sounds wash over me, giving a sometimes powerful sense of being young, lost, poor but very alive in the U.S. heartland. It's also notable that this is very much a film about ""America"", by a film-maker from the U.K., and it occasionally feels a bit like an outsider's slightly cartoon-ish critique of American culture, greed, consumerism, poverty, family. One confederate flag image might have been potent. 5 or 6 starts to feel like shooting fish in a barrel. But all carping aside, there are some beautiful images and terrific moments and even some brilliant set pieces that boldly defy and challenge emotional expectations. Arnold gets remarkably natural, honest performances from her largely non-professional cast, and gets the best work from the talented but often wasted Shia LaBoeuf in quite a while. Even if imperfect, the film is well worth seeing for fans of Arnold or of tonal, deliberate film-making (Terrence Malick comes to mind)."

Sadly, the result is disappointing ‚Äì despite good or okay acting by the lead girl, the film fails to convey any significant message of meaning. Instead it rapidly devolves into a cavalcade of shallowness and base urges, complete with an annoying and unnecessary visual style.Many scenes are essentially a waste of film in a pretentious attempt to convey some purportedly sublime point that is supposed to be expressed in close-ups of flies resting on a car. The film also carries a repetitive element to it, with certain footage and settings being repeated over and over again. This makes one lose interest very fast.Not recommended."

But the tangible chemistry between the two soon complicates things, as does Star's questioning of her mentor's ways.Director Andrea Arnold keeps her camera close to her lead at all times, focusing on her eyes and her lips as she processes everything going on around her. The film is quite interesting and even with a long running time of over 2 hours and 40 minutes,it remains entertaining and interesting at all times. Lead by Sasha Lane as a possible star taking turn, she most definitely has a unique star presence and charisma. She carries the film in her scenes.American Honey shares some similarities to Spring Breakers, though that film is more visually stunning, with more over the top performances. American Honey may become a future cult classic type film, which is quite unique, fresh and brave throughout. This is a film that is for a certain audience and anti mainstream, where many people may be turned off to it due to certain aspects as it's running length."
" Skip this one......

So this review is meant to lower the average to help movie lovers picking movies. This is one of the most boring movies ever, and it lasts for 2h43mins. Pure hell. The plot is unrealistic and non-evolving. Characters all seem to have some kind of brain damage so it is really hard to identify or connect with them. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
" A wonderful film but with its share of longueurs
",0.631,0.9716,2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"There are close to 100 reviews of this film so I'll get to the point. On the plus side, it has an authentic feel to it as the crew cut through the American Midwest - I've traveled to these same places (albeit a long time ago) and recognised the look and feel of the landscapes. The film is basically carried by the Star character, Sasha Lane, and she's superb in the role - headstrong and annoying at times, but eminently likable, and in the end she finds a real family to belong to, which neither she nor any of the other misfit kids she's traveling with have presumably ever had. As a portrayal of a bunch of lost kids careening through America, it's excellent, both downbeat and uplifting at the same time. On the downside, the premise is a bit unbelievable. Can these kids really earn enough through selling magazine subscriptions to provide them with room and board plus additional expenses like all the drugs and booze they consume, plus fuel, clothing, dog food, personal items like cosmetics and toothpaste, etc? It seems unlikely, but that's essentially a minor point - either you accept that they can, or not. The real problem with the film is its length - at 157 minutes, it's just way too long, there are too many longueurs, too many shots of them singing rap and hip- hop songs in their van, while some scenes, like Star's encounter with the three identically dressed Texan men, go on for far too long and probably aren't even necessary; a good 40 or 50 minutes could have and should have been shaved from the film - didn't anyone have the nerve to tell Arnold this? It would have been interesting too to learn more about some of the other kids, as we're told virtually nothing about any of them. In all, however, its a fine, enjoyable film that despite its longueurs provides a sharp glimpse into the lives of lost and rootless young American kids."

She leaves the kids with their partying mom and follows his group of traveling youths led by Krystal (Riley Keough). She calls her a real American Honey. Ostensibly, they sell magazine subscriptions door to door but in reality, they get the money any which way.Newcomer Sasha Lane has a real presence about her. Shia LaBeouf is fully harnessing his instability. The young cast brings a sense of authentic intensity with the pumping music. I would have liked an older actor for the Riley Keough Pied Piper character. It would add to the creepy sexual tension in the power dynamics. Although, there is value to a scantily clad Riley. As for the story, the movie is a little long and rambling at times. Tighter writing would ratchet up the natural intensity of the performances. This movie is a nice revelation. It could have been a real standout of the year if the editing bay is employed more."

" Watch Fish Tank Instead
",0.0,0.983,2017-03-16 00:00:00,5,"Anyone comparing this film to Larry Clark's KIDS is way off. The only thing they both have in common is that both involve a ragtag group of teenagers. KIDS felt very real -- and scary. This film is laughable in its representation of kids going door-to-door selling magazine subscriptions in affluent neighborhoods. As some other poster noted, who does that anymore? Also, Star (Sasha Lane) puts herself into a few dangerous situations but comes out none the worse for wear. The kids all smoke and drink to excess (do they ever eat?) but still get up early and are able to work every day. Granted, there are some scenes that work such as the opening scene with Star and her siblings, as well as a later scene with her helping some impoverished kids. There's also a sex scene with her and Shia LaBeouf that's well-done. The film is indulgently long though and has a tedious soundtrack. If you like rap music ad nauseam then you won't mind. Andrea Arnold has made good films, notably FISH TANK, also starring an unknown young actress, Katie Jarvis. Both Lane and Jarvis give beautiful performances. FISH TANK, however, had a well-developed storyline and was engrossing. It also focused on a young woman who wanted to escape her family life. I would recommend watching FISH TANK rather than this one."
" Great film, relatable

Anyone who lives in a bubble may not be able to fully understand it, but it displays a story about the type of kids that normally would be looked down upon and it doesn't judge them, simply displays there life and hardships, it feels like you are actually on a long road trip with them,etc. For example,I've had the pleasure of being friends and hanging out in the poorest neighborhoods all the way up to swimming in millionaire's pools and having friends from all walks of life, ethnicity, gender, color, creed,etc. and that life experience helps me to relate to each character or sympathize with them.

People are pretending there is some poignant meaning or message in this film, there isn't, it's your imagination. Maybe the genius of this film is you're tricked into watching a couple of hours of dull conversations between dull characters who all possess the traits of dull people (they've spent some time making their appearance stand out to compensate for their lack of substance). You're supposed to believe that these charmless hedonists are capable of convincing middle Americans to subscribe to their garbage magazines, an unfortunate senile pensioner wouldn't give a bean to these morons. There's a curiosity that keeps you watching, waiting for something to happen, nothings does though.

Intrigued by the poster of Star from the back with her outstretched arm and bra straps on display, I missed my chance to see it. Netflix to the rescue with a blu-ray version delivered USPS. Long story short, the film is masterfully expressed bringing together disparate elements into a solid feature. It has a desperate energy unique in film with an ensemble cast (except for Jake) of virtual unknowns who subtly inhabit their characters and create a genuine and honest slice of life narrative. Whereas I found Kids to be bleak there is something profoundly hopeful about Star as she gracefully maneuvers through the modern landscape of southwestern America. I don't use the word masterpiece but once or twice a decade but this film has all the earmarks. I was transported to another world and joined these rowdy kids on their ersatz road trip finding it to be a thoroughly worthwhile artistic experience. I implore you to see this film. As far as 2016 goes it should be right up there with La La Land and Hacksaw Ridge as one of the best films of the year."

The result was a movie that at least was 30 minutes too long, probably an hour. The gaps in plot initially could be overlooked, but after awhile they just made the movie preposterous. (Who can drink half a bottle of mescal and show zero effects?) Much of the violence was nonsensical. In real life, these kids would have been arrested dozens of times, raped and/or robbed. In movie life, nothing bad happens."
" Brit director's sympathetic portrait of young, rebellious magazine subscription agents proves a tad bit troubling
",-0.34,0.1222,2017-02-20 00:00:00,5,"Andrea Arnold is a British film director, so what's she doing outside her native UK bringing us a story of young magazine subscription agents plying their trade in such far-off places in the heartland as Muskogee, Oklahoma and Kansas City? The answer is that she came here and did her research and even discovered the film's star, newcomer Sasha Lane, who was sunbathing on a beach while on spring break from college.Lane plays Star, a rebellious teenager residing in the aforementioned Muskogee, who is taking care of two children when she runs into Jake (Shia LaBeouof) at a local K-Mart parking lot. He offers her a job if she comes with him and his group to Kansas. After dumping off the kids back with their trailer trash mom, Star returns to where the group's van is parked and falls asleep until Jake finds her there in the morning, delighted that she has agreed to travel to Kansas and become part of the team selling magazine subscriptions.Keep in mind that this group of young people are not whom you might expect: a coterie of clean-cut, Fundamentalist Christians selling wholesome magazines--but quite the contrary, a group of foul-mouthed cut-ups who revel in playing pranks on one another when not working and obnoxiously belting out hip-hop numbers reflecting their anti-establishment weltanschauung. You would think that Star would fit right in here but her surly demeanor prevents her from being a particularly good salesperson.Star soon runs afoul of the group's leader, Krystal, an all-business supervisor who sees a potential problem with her new hire's inability to interact effectively with customers. Krystal pairs Star up with her best salesperson, Jake, entrusting him with showing her the ropes as they go door to door. Soon, bad boy Jake's sales performance begins to suffer due to being distracted by the sexy Star, but she's determined to prove she can outsell him. Soon afterward she's picked up by three middle-aged Texas ""cowboys"" who agree to buy a large amount of her magazines if she's willing to swallow a worm from the bottom of a glass of Mezcal (a strong Mexican alcoholic beverage).Wouldn't you know it but Jake shows up--mistakenly believing that the cowboys are taking advantage of Star‚Äîand robs them at gunpoint. Star I suppose recognizes that Jake is a quintessential bad boy and agrees to have sex with him, consummating their burgeoning romance. It's around this time that Jake reveals he has a stash of jewelry that he's stolen from various potential customers at the houses he visits, which he eventually plans to sell in order to purchase a house.Echoing the scene with the cowboys, Star is off again on her own, but this time earning ""extracurricular"" cash prostituting herself to an oil worker. Jake, in a fit of jealousy, attacks the oil worker (off screen) and is eventually let go by Krystal, who informs Star that he's been sleeping with all the girls he's recruited for her. Despite all of the negativity, director Arnold attempts to make her protagonist more sympathetic when she shows Star buying groceries for a bunch of kids in a rundown area in Rapid City, South Dakota. Is it really enough though? Both Star and Jake are not exactly what you would call upright, law-abiding citizens. Both are guilty of armed robbery (I wonder why the police weren't looking for both of them after the ""cowboy"" caper) and Jake is certainly guilty of assaulting the oil worker. An additional accomplice might be the film's director, in that it appears her fascination with such disreputable characters as Star and Jake borders on outright sympathy and misguided approbation. Others might argue that Arnold is merely a calculating observer of rebellious young persons who live on the edge. Certainly she's done well extracting strong performances from her principals, Lane and LaBeouf, reminiscent of James Dean and Natalie Wood in the ""iconic"" teen rebellion ""epic,"" Rebel Without a Cause. Still, she wastes too much time (the film clocks in at around a lugubrious two and a half hours)covering her mindless magazine subscription agents as they boorishly interact inside their van heading to one city after another.American Honey's ending is ambiguous. Jake is suddenly back on the team and gives Star a turtle, which she releases into a lake, immersing herself in the water, during the group's celebratory bonfire. The breed of amoral nihilists that Arnold finds so fascinating here certainly don't deserve our commendation. The director unfortunately has more mixed feelings about her subjects, and others might just find that a tad bit troubling."

American Honey is like a modern take of ""On the Road"" yet better in every aspect, the shots finds its beauty within its simplicity that being the perfect combination of the outcasted youth as they coast from gorgeous American landscapes, rich suburbs and white trash ghettos.In regards to the acting every now and then a film will come along with apart from Shia an unknown cast, this film sometimes finds yourself convinced they found these actors from similar backgrounds as there character, some what like the film ""This is England""All in all if you enjoy a film where you can switch off for a few hours and enjoy an emotional beautiful ride, in a story not often told then this is it"

" Where Did the American Dream Go?
",0.25,0.5023,2017-02-06 00:00:00,6,"With all the talk generated during the most recent presidential election about how out of touch one half of America is with the other, it takes a British filmmaker to give us a movie that brings the socioeconomic discrepancies between one part of America and another to light in a way that no other recent movie has.The young drifters in this movie are amazed at Kansas City, never having seen so many tall buildings together in one place before. A conversation with an older, professional trucker reveals that a dream both characters share is seeing the ocean. One girl thinks people who make $100,000 a year are rich.Wow, talk about a world away from where I live (Chicago) and where a salary of $100,000 makes owning a home barely affordable. For awhile, ""American Honey"" is a compelling glimpse into the life of those who have long since been left behind by the American dream. But the film goes on far too long and is far too monotonous to remain compelling for its entire duration. We only really get to know one person in the movie, a young woman named Star who is running from the hopelessness of her situation to.....what, exactly? She doesn't know, and that's the point of the movie. But that point is made long before the movie itself ends, and without much character development (Star's character arc is awfully short for a nearly three-hour movie), I found my attention and interest wandering in the film's final half hour or so.Grade: B"
" A beautiful experience: more than a movie
",0.5994,0.966,2017-02-05 00:00:00,9,"""American Honey"" is a movie that needs its unprecedented length. It transcends the usual tropes and boundaries of film and becomes an experience, not just for the people on-screen, but the people watching it. The most common boundary of all: the fourth wall, has been breached. You feel like you're up there with them, living free and loving life.Star is a teenage girl who flees her unhappy home life to be with a group of traveling salespeople. These are not people who live to work, but work to live, having stumbled on this one way to make a living, keep traveling, and keep the dream alive. The oldest member of the group, who appears in his late twenties, is also the craziest, a true example of someone who took the road less traveled and frantically reinvents himself with every sale.If the movie has a flaw, it's that the mystical nature of this traveling circus sideshow is a little hard to swallow as something that could exist. This group is so in sync and in tune with each other that you have to wonder how long they must have been together to achieve this harmony. But then, this is a question you don't have to ask, so why should you? If you were on that bus, with this crowd, would you be thinking about the past?Or the future?"
" ""We fell in love in a hopeless place""
",0.296,0.9977,2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"This is sun-drenched, ultra-cinema-verite, like if the Maysles took a couple of bong hits before making a movie about kids selling magazines halfway across the country. This said though, by the end of it, not unlike Springbreakers (this is VERY Larry Clark and Harmony Korine, more on that in a minute), though it's also clearly the same voice that did Fish Tank as well, I thought to myself... what was the point? But then when you have so many compelling little details it's bound to amount to something.While I'm not sure in American Honey if there is a 'point,' maybe Andrea Arnold didn't intend for one. Not every drama needs a thesis statement, but I was hoping for more by the end of the movie than 'well, they just keep going on, and maybe this character will move on, or not, it's what it is, right?' I'm starting off by saying this since I want to get my gripes out of the way first; for the most part, Arnold's film is worthwhile and special as a document of 2016 while seeming to be a piece of fiction. If there is a point to it all it's... 'hey, this is America, wow, what do you think of it? hashtagTrump, right?' Actually, when I think about it now typing this, it may be another example of current-day American neo-realism (the year before Bahrani did that to an extent with 99 Homes), where we, whether we are familiar with this world of the middle America, with its sometimes okay sections (i.e. those who work in the oil fields, some town) and the much poorer ones, see what the people are going through via some select fictional characters.This is a road movie that has the barest set-up - Star, a young woman who has a nowhere future with a man she can't stand taking care of kids that (I think) aren't even hers, is picked out by a sort-of-not-really-maybe-depends-on-which-way-you're-looking smooth-talker Jake, Shia LaBeouf plays, who asks if she'd like to come along with he and his group to sell magazines - and then takes off into nearly three hours of a narrative that is loose as hell, a series of episodes as Star and Jake sort-of-not-really grow closer, and she keeps on doing what she's always been: being herself, which can work and sometimes, painfully, not.If I were to teach a serious screen writing class to some younger people, this would be an excellent example of how to make a movie that doesn't necessarily have to adhere to a three-act structure. This doesn't mean that it's without an emotional throughline, at least in some form: we see how Star and Jake have their relationship, which gets tested by the ""boss"" of the group played by a no-BS (except when she gets away with it, which is often) Riley Keough (she, like Sasha Lane as Star, is so convincing I thought she was like all the other people, likely plucked from the 'streets' so to speak, and actually I found out Lane *was* plucked from the streets, it's her debut, which makes this as astonishing as something De Sica or Rossellini might do, it's one of the underrated performances of the year).But American Honey serves as a case where you don't have to follow some rigid structure, albeit it takes someone with a unique perspective to make it interesting. Does this mean it's totally unique? No, it's not; we've seen depictions of American youth who have no ties to any family and have made their own familial unit in a f***ed up way, but Larry Clark and Harmony Korine seem more like the closest of kin. The Springbreakers analogy may not be totally fair, however, as the crimes done in the movie are mostly (if not all) done by the loose-cannon Jake, who may or may not use that gun that gets set up pretty early in the story. And unlike that film, the 'don't-give-a-motherf***' world these people are in is anchored by Arnold's attention to details, and that Star is someone that, if we can't exactly put ourselves into as far as the full-blown empathy goes, she serves as someone we can see this world through up to a point, and the camera is often looking at objects and things: the scenery, bugs, water, oil derricks, fire, etc etc.I think the curious visual aspect, how she moves her camera, which can be at times as frenetic as a found footage movie and at other times, with its natural lighting and sense of a place that has weight and grit and raw energy of finding things in spur of the moments, carried me through a lot of American Honey, and it's a film that has a love for little details in the world. Yet the other problem comes that there's simply too much movie here, too much looseness. It's great to see someone who, I'm sure, exercised her final cut without even breaking a sweat, but there came some points where we're hanging just too long, scenes lagging to a point where I found myself saying ""alright, Get on with it!"" ala Monty Python. That's not a nuanced criticism, but it turned me sometimes into a cranky studio executive.All this said, there are passages in this film that are as affecting and effective as any major drama this year and LaBeouf is better here than he's been in years, likely taking from the energy that's there with Lane and the other real people to get to the point where he creates his own persona and (as much as he can try) is simply there with everybody else. While I didn't love it, I applaud it and hold it up as an example of uncompromising American independent cinema in this decade (again from the magnificent A24 studio, like the Weinsteins in the 90's only better and keeping the independent spirit in a truer sense). 7.5/10"

",0.6705,0.9039,2017-01-30 00:00:00,9,"At 2 hrs. and 42 min. in length, this film, as I see it, will be one that some viewers will really like while others will extremely dislike. I fall into the former category, as I found its astounding realism to be incredibly unique in a motion picture, and it maintained a mysterious sense of tension and danger throughout.The three leads here, Sasha Lane, Shia LaBeouf, and Riley Keogh, are all terrific in their individual roles, with Lane making an awesome feature debut. She portrays Star, a young woman living a miserable life who decides to join a band of door-to-door traveling salespersons, in the American Midwest. I'm certain we'll hear a lot more from this 21-year-old in the years to come.LaBeouf is perfect for the role of Jake, one of the managers and top salesman in the group, who is frenetic, highly unpredictable, and has immediate chemistry with Star. Keough plays the character of Krystal to the hilt as well, the imperious boss of the whole operation, who uses Jake as a man-servant and dislikes and distrusts Star from the start.Overall, this movie written and directed by British filmmaker Andrea Arnold, whose 2008 film ""Fish Tank"" I really liked, had me engrossed from the start and feeling like I was right there among these ""lost souls"". I had to watch it in 2 sittings due to its length, and am still feeling a pervasive sense of sadness about the whole experience."

Watching this at 2-4x speed with subtitles is the only way I could actually sit through the whole movie. And even then, the most tiny distraction from the film be it a text message, an email, or a book I've been putting off reading was far more engaging and entertaining than this movie. I honestly thought it would be good because the blurb drew me in and normally I love these stories where the characters are endearing and growing and beautiful, but these weren't even interesting. I understand the subject matter is pretty boring, but that's all the more reason to make the film shorter and more succinct instead of making it a chore to slog through totally throwaway scenes that blatantly bring nothing to character development or plot progression."

On the Odd-ysy, we are given a tour of middle America that might have been written by Donald Trump as he describes this country in his road to the election. No, we are not shown America as a land of Honey. The tour through hell relies on the viewer being blasted with a lot of rock songs that apparently are meant to tell the story, (what story?) instead of dialogue. We are introduced to a truck driver willing to give the girl hero $500 for a hand job, and a group of old boys in cowboy hats who feed her booze, promise to buy her books, and don't set the cops on her and her goofy boyfriend who steal their convertible. This is a picture that is hard for me to like in any way."
" Liked the premise but not well executed
",-0.0826,-0.9565,2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"This movie highlighted some of the issues, endemic in low socioeconomic societies in many contemporary cultures. Crystal for me was a sort of Fagan character. The rest of the 'team', could either be Fagan's gang or in contemporary terms not unlike a street gang. Both share that the 'team' is a pseudo family, Star is lured in by the fun and frivolity but Star eventually learns that not everything is as it seems. The team members live somewhat communally and travel together in a large van. To alleviate tension Crystal has devised a 'loser night', where the two team members that sell the least, are pitted against each other in a physical fight, which doesn't really appear to bother anyone. It's all about the sales, even their team songs emphasise this. Owing to the excessive length of the film, and boredom, I watched in chunks. The length of the film is at best the director being too involved with the film and not wanting to edit enough to sharpen and condense the story. At worst it is the director believing the audience is ignorant and feels the need to drip feed ALL of the subtext of the film."
" American Stupidity
",-0.4404,-0.9349,2017-01-23 00:00:00,1,"What a wonderful artsy movie. Perfectly captures American stupidity and millennial ignorance and entitlement. The acting was horrible. Felt like everyone in this movie was reading their lines off of cue cards. The main character was a pathetic, tattooed moron who seemed completely oblivious to what is right and wrong, and had the mental capacity of a 10 year old (no offense to ten year olds). Overwrought, underdevelopment, pure American immorality on display. This movie serves no purpose whatsoever,except to document Shia La Beouf's career descent and the lack of talent of the rest of the cast, and lastly, to provide some insight to the international audience, how the US could possible elect such a hideous criminal as president and how bleak our future generation really is."
" A poetic film about the impossibility of the American dream
",0.25,0.9965,2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"This is an incredible film by Andrea Arnold, but you have to be very patient. It is the kind of story that could be told in 90 minutes but Arnold takes her time making her characters so real that by the end, you hope there is a follow up sequel. (Although that unlikely given its art house genre!)This film is about the impossibilities of the American dream. It's anchored by rap, pop and hip hop music that the characters all sing along to. They know every word. Those songs promise a big full life: love, money, sex, power. But juxtaposed with the realities of these kids' lives (and of most Americans') they amount to empty promises. The songs sell a dream, like the kids sell magazines. It's a good hard sell that by its very nature it leads you to selling yourself.Arnold tells a story of complex ideas, with an incredibly light-touch. A portrait of the subculture of traveling kids selling magazines to make money for their pimp (a very excellent and subtle Riley Keough). Based on a true story from Rolling Stone magazine, it is not entirely bleak portrayal of transient living , instead Arnold decides to show you the pull of it. They have fun. They fall in love. They have wins. They have losses. They are us. Excellent, nuanced performances all around make for a very strong indie film. Reminiscent of the better American indies from the 70's but 100% uniquely Arnold.Almost forgot the 3/4 aspect ration because the world seemed quite big. But it is a stark reminder that for most of the world, life can never really be as big as the songs tell you it can be."
" Nice Visuals but nothing else...unless you like Hip Hop music
",-0.1938,0.9825,2017-01-15 00:00:00,3,"I recommend this movie only to rap enthusiasts who need a quick Sunday afternoon nap after working in the garden the whole morning. This is one very long, very repetitive movie. If you don't like hip hop then rather stay away. I remember Kids from way back. Why this movie is being compared to Kids I don't know. I don't want to put people off watching any movie but this one I can not recommend to anybody. I am sure there will be people who enjoy this. To be honest, there are very nice scenery throughout. It lacks in the story for me. Every scene is basically the same. I found it hilarious when even one of the characters got fed up with all the hip hop being played all the time.Please make movies the way it used to be made. I watched Back to the future this morning and even a old movie like that is 100 times better!"
" To redefine the life and to discover the love.
",0.6369,0.9754,2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"From the British director of 'Fish Tank' fame, this is another a young struggling girl's story. Being brought up in a low income and abusive family, and because of that trying to redefine the life. Not about heading the wrong way like drugs and other related stuffs. So this is the story of an older teen girl named Star who flees the home to find her new life and love. It all begins when she meets a youngster in a supermarket and since then she followed him everywhere. Actually the film focused to tell a gang of youth who are door to door magazine subscription dealers. They travel all over the country and have all kinds of enjoyment.In order to stay in the group, Star has to prove her worth. She reserves her spot, but working on her own way. I always feared the narration might go to take a nasty twist. There came a couple scenes near to that, but compromised not to change the mood of the storytelling. Because it seems the writer was interested to reveal a girl try to achieve two goals. After coming to know one of it was staged, how she contemplates the other one crafted carefully. Not to forget, her fate, the future depends on it, since she's not well qualified to go out in the world to do whatever she wants.So I think it was a decent film with a decent message. If you know the director, you would know what her films talk about. Unlike 'Fish Tank', this is about an American girl. The influence of lifestyle, culture, almost everything related to youngsters covered. The lead actress was good. It was not Shia Labeouf's film, but in a supporting role, he did his best. There are a few others I knew, but they did not get big part. The only issue with it was the length. If you are okay with it, especially for a slow drama, then the film is enjoyable. 'American Honey' is like 'American Money', one of the ways people try to make their 'American Dream' come to true. This film is exclusively for drama genre fans.7/10"

" Worst I've ever seen
",-0.6249,0.8993,2017-01-10 00:00:00,1,"This is a terrible movie, i have been watching low budget and high budget films over the past 20 years and merit some of the benefits like a great story from the lower budget ones,however this movie is full of idiots listening to idiotic music making horrible life choices and basically acting like the scum of the earth. These youngsters have no morals or respect for anything or one other than themselves. Anyone who answered a door to these morons or giving them money must be a weak dumb person,and that's what these morons pray on. There is no point to the story and no point in what they do. Its awful,the direction is even worse and as for shia labeouf. Shia has done some serious rubbish and i mean rubbish,the man likes to think he's mr cool but he is anything but,his acting talent is not that bad but he hasn't had a movie script worthy enough to prove himself. This is truly the worst film i have seen in the last 10 years, and these idiots in it and the direct should just go away from the movie business and realise there are people out there who are a lot more talented than them, who ever wrote this or funded it is one of those idiots who gave them money at the door. Cheap,bad acting,worse music,deadbeats, a recipe for trash."
" American ugly
",-0.5106,0.9462,2017-01-10 00:00:00,6,"Besides the sentimental digressions, this film is about people who abuse various marketing tricks to sell other people stuff they don't need, calls for pity being among those tricks. It seems that the film itself tries to follow the same way with its audience, giving us some raw or shocking imagery to induce sympathy and compassion, and then use those emotions to make us buy into the story happening on the screen.However, just like the main heroine who, out of her juvenile maximalism and stubbornness, breaks her partner/mentor's selling strategy, American Honey never seems to really care about making us believe that the movie characters actually want a better life for themselves. In fact, it actually promotes this life of a misfit as a source of some twisted and painful but still happiness, as if the characters don't complain about their destiny but rather brag about it.And since it's a dollar in our pocket that the movie is after, I have a question: ""it's all very gritty, but why should I care?"". Trying to combine the notes of a typical carefree road movie and a dark social/psychological drama, American Honey falls on its bare bottom right in between, failing to be believable and sincere as any of its options. And with no message other than the story itself, combined with no satisfying finale for that story, I just don't see how this film deserves to have my emotions and/or my gratitude.Perhaps, just like the characters keep reiterating throughout the movie, it's all about making money. But in this case you're not having any from me. Now please close the door from the outside and go look for someone more gullible."
" Worst ""movie"" I've ever seen in my life.
",-0.6249,-0.1377,2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"I watched the whole thing, not sure why, and I just couldn't believe how bad it was. I wasted and hour and a half of my precious time. The director should try a different career. Shame on Shia for doing this movie. The acting in general was pretty lame, even the music of the entire movie sucked big time. The only good of the entire movie was the girl, I guess. Not that pretty but kinda cute. Also, the story is awful and don't understand the message, or the lack of one. Honestly, I only watched it because of the 7 point rating. I respect Shia but I'm not a big fan of his movies, except Wall Street 2. Overall a horrible movie. 1 point rating."
" The Acting :)
",0.4588,0.6843,2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"For me in order to tell a good story you need good actors, people that will express the essence of the story that wants to be told. And the actors here were authentic, it felt real. Although it is a long movie and some shots become quite repetitive making it a bit tiring, in a way it makes you feel like you are there with them, inside the van traveling for hours to their different destinations, looking at them as if you were sitting right next to them. It feels like a true story being recorded with a common camera at times. There is nothing amazing about the story, it could probably have been any story, it is the actors that engaged me and kept me sitting there watching the movie. It was trying to understand their minds, it was feeling empathetic towards them and also feeling pity, sadness, disgust."
" American Honey (spoiler warning)
",0.0,0.9625,2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"My first reaction to American Honey was ""holy crap this is a long movie."" The movie clocks in at just about 2 and 3 quarters hours long. Unfortunately the length does not seem to be totally justified. In American Honey, young people take a hedonistic road trip, fueled by gasoline, alcohol, and marijuana smoke selling magazine subscriptions. American Honey focuses on the life of Star, a poor girl from Texas trying to find some meaning in the world. She begins the film in a rather unfortunate, not fully explained, situation taking care of a couple kids for two redneck parents. The mother of the children has an affinity for square dancing, as that's where Star drops the kids off after being uncomfortably assaulted by their father. After dropping the kids off at the bar, Star goes on a journey to Kansas City with a group of misfits to sell magazine subscriptions, a group including none other than the only real star in the film, Shia Labeouf, who invites Star to work for him and ""explore America, party, a whole bunch of ****, it's cool."" Shia rocks an awkward ponytail and eyebrow piercing in the film, which is oddly not out of place at all in the group of young magazine salespeople. The group of salespeople consists of mostly teenagers, pierced and tatted up, often shirtless, living lives of relative freedom and squalor. The group has odd rules, such as the salesperson to sell the least amount of subscriptions for the day is publicly shamed, and at the end of the week the two salespeople with the smallest takes duke it out in a straight on wrestling match. One character loves to show his dick to the rest of the group often. There are two gay boys in the group as well, who are actually very tastefully not exploited by the film's plot. The group of young salespeople is very authentic, with the actors delivering some very solid performances; so solid it almost feels like these kids are just living their lives in front of a camera. When star begins a journey to Kansas City, the film manages to evoke a feeling of newness and freedom, the open road provides the greatest of possibilities in Star's life. America is a place of the interconnected, highways running from town to town, city to city, gas stations and fast food restaurants all along the way. There is loud youth-based music, mostly hip-hop, blasting the whole drive. When the group arrives in Kansas City, Star explains to Shia that her mother named her because ""we're all made of dead stars."" Shia then starts calling her Deathstar throughout the movie. This sparse dialogue is heard throughout the film. It starts seeming a little heavy-handed and inauthentic. After the road trip and deep conversation about the state of matter, Star is confronted with a much bleaker reality, when she finds Shia Labeouf's sales tactics immoral on their first magazine sale. They are selling magazines in a very nice neighborhood, and a customer invites them into her house. Star seems to have a panic attack of sorts, and ends up acting very rudely towards the customer, cussing at her. Star's actions seem to be rooted in a sense of envy of their customer, for their lavish lifestyle and fancy house. She not only goes off on the customer, she goes off on Shia for his questionable sales tactics, which include lying about going to college by selling so many magazine subscriptions. Throughout the film Star shows an antagonistic attitude towards customers and the whole business of selling magazines. She shows an almost total indifference to her job. At one point in the film Star hitchhikes with a friendly trucker, who asks her what her dream in life is. Star replies that she has never been asked that question before, but would like her own trailer, and some children. Star later asks Shia's character the same question, and he also says he's never been asked that question before. It's somewhat far fetched that either of these characters have literally never been asked this question in their lives, but hey, heavy-handed dialogue is a feature of this movie. Star's indifference to the sale of magazines leads to an awkward scene with an oil worker where she ends up selling her body for money. Star has been defeated by the system. She doesn't have a career of any sort so resorts to selling the only thing she has in her life, her body. There are some other random scenes throughout the film involving non-human life. Bugs in swimming pools. A random bear walking around growling in Star's face. And a turtle Star places in the water. Star feels a deeper connection with these non-human life forms than she does to the human life forms she feels forced to spend time with. She does have an affinity for Shia's character, but realizes that he too, doesn't care about her, just like the capitalistic system she exists within. There is admittedly one scene where Star buys food for the children of a crackhead, which is touching. American Honey is an overly long film with some interesting moments and messages throughout: Capitalisms indifference to well being is a big takeaway; youth culture's ability to cope and interact with the need of an income to survive; nature and it's survival in the modern era, just to name a few. Freedom The two highlights of the film are the young group of actors, who all seem very authentic in their roles, almost like they've lived these characters lives, and the soundtrack, which is continually excellent and youth based."
" Huge waste of time.
",-0.128,0.9678,2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"This movie rambles on aimlessly for nearly 3 hours. The soundtrack is crappy, and the plot is nearly non-existent. I don't need 163 minutes to see a story about a teenaged love triangle. The theme of income disparity is made rather early and the rest of the time I found myself wondering when the plot twist or the conflict was coming. **Spoiler Alert** It never does. The soundtrack is mostly crappy rap music. I like good rap, I was raised on it, but there hasn't been any good rap since the late 90's or the early 2000's. Overall, I really wish I had those 163 minutes of my life back. The only thing that kept me watching was Sasha Lane. I found her look to be interesting and her cuteness was the only thing that held my interest. I would suggest skipping this snooze fest entirely."
" Lost and found on the road to nowhere.
",-0.3182,0.9185,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"A young girl, named Star, with no economic abilities, bears the heavy responsibility of raising her two younger siblings.Hungry after living the life of a teenager she gets attracted to a group of young people at a supermarket with high spirit and a bad attitude. She leaves her siblings behind and joins the group who lives from day to day selling magazines to whomever they meet. The common denominator is the selling of magazines. How to do it? How to manipulate the potential buyer with different kind of stories up the sleeve that is supposed to impose sympathy? As Oliver Twist is lured into Fagins lair and is taught to pick pockets without knowing what he is doing so is Star initially. At the point where she understands the rules and laws of the group, she is involved in such a way that she accepts the game and takes some very big risks and further compromises her own moral values.The force of the movie is the depiction of the life on the road, the interaction between our marginalized young people and slowly getting to know our protagonist, who in the beginning is the silent observer and little by little starts to unfold her personality.I can see that the movie is being criticized for being very long and not having a story that develops from a start- to an endpoint. I agree that some of the scenes are prolonged to a point that seems unnecessary. Besides this I think that this movie is a perfect example of how the truth often lies in the detail. This means that we need to dwell in some of the scenes and that the artistic challenge is to let this happen in a way that gets the audience involved.Again I must express my deepest respect for director Andrea Arnold who has the rare ability to show a milieu in such a convincing way that it at certain points seems as if you are not watching a movie but instead a documentary but without losing the storytelling.Regards SimonPs.

" Like Being On A Hamster Wheel
",0.3612,-0.9157,2017-01-02 00:00:00,2,"Masterpiece. That's what's being flung in the direction of ""American Honey."" Seems 'masterpiece' has several definitions: 1) a person's greatest piece of work, as in an art; 2) anything done with masterly skill; 3) a consummate example of skill or excellence of any kind.This film certainly is not three. Nor two. Not being familiar with the filmmaker's other work, this may be the first definition. That means the filmmaker's other works are more boring and indulgent than ""American Honey."" That's hard to fathom. Reminder: don't watch any other Andrea Arnold films.This pseudo-documentary cements its painfully redundant and overlong structure with meaningful scenes that are too few and too far between. A look at the watch at sixty-three minutes in brought terror as there remained another one hour and forty minutes. The film had all it had to say at sixty-three minutes. Cut that one hundred minutes by about seventy minutes and this might have been a damn good cinematic experience - though derivative of many far better films. You know them. Name them.There are forty-some-odd minutes of essentially the same footage, from the same angle with similar sing-a-long, of the magazine crew in the van bopping down the highway to Rap music while silent Star looks wistfully at the passing landscape. Forty Fricking Some-Odd Minutes! Sure, we'd like a sense of the repetitive nature of the character's lives, but we don't want to be as bored as them. Fire your editor, Andrea. No! Fire yourself.""American Honey"" is not without merit. There's a rawness and truth in the rootless lives of these magazine urchins, and subtle commentary of the gulf between haves and have-nots. However, Shia LaBoeuf and Sasha Lane (her first film) have zero chemistry. Further, LaBoeuf minces around as if in an amateur production shot with your uncle's video camera. His un-tethered performance, Lane's callowness, and the length, sink this film. The one bright spot is Riley Keough's Krystal. At least we know she's alive. However, we don't know anything more about any of the characters due to a lack of arc or development by final credits.Amazing this film is mentioned on many critics 2016 Top 10 lists. In a year as patently lackluster at the box office as 2016, ""American Honey"" is a dim bulb on a vast ocean of darkness. That's not wan praise. It's no praise for this bore of a film."
" Sasha Lane!
",0.0,0.911,2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Featuring a cast riddled with amateur actors (aside from Shia LaBeouf and Riley Keough (granddaughter of Elvis Presley) ""American Honey"" is more than just another Cannes Film Festival calling card for writer/director Andrea Arnold, it is a gritty, startling master-class example of ""slice of life"" direction, the likes of 2016's ""Manchester by the Sea"" or ""King Jack"".Synopsis: A teenage girl, living in extreme poverty, is recruited into a traveling sales crew filled with other teens in her same situation. The group travels cross-country, scamming people into buying magazine subscriptions by day and partying incredibly hard by night.Arnold's hand-held camera work only helped immerse me into this lesser known subculture, watching these economically disadvantaged teens make sketchy life choices as they come of age inside a van sized commune of their peers. But it's the stellar performance from newcomer Sasha Lane which gives major credibility to this film and justifies some of its more minor flaws as well as the run-time. Much of the satisfaction I received from ""American Honey"" came from watching Lane's character evolve throughout.Final Thought: There are a few misplaced lines of dialogue, which seem to force-feed a bit more than I would have liked, and at a nearly three hour run-time, this Indie will be perceived as an intimidating venture for some, but boy is it worth your time. The genuine atmosphere of ""American Honey"" speaks to this generation like not many movies do, and will stay with you for days after viewing."
" Awful
",-0.4588,0.1299,2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Boring, vapid and just plain phony. The film follows a crew of young, mostly white trash teens and twenty-somethings as they travel the middle of the US selling magazines, but mostly riding in a large van smoking cigarettes or pot and nodding along to hip-hop (note to Andrea Arnold: people who wear Confederate flag bikinis generally don't listen to much hip-hop). The plot follows newbie Sasha Lane, who joins because she instantly crushes on the alpha male of the group, played by Shia LaBeouf. They are led by Riley Keough, who is sleeping with LaBeouf and is wary of Lane. There's little plot, pretty much the same thing over and over with Lane and LaBeouf eventually hooking up. Somehow it drags on for nearly three hours. The music licensing has to have cost a fortune. Lane, LaBeouf and Keough aren't bad, but none of the hundred other characters on this trip ever comes off as resembling actual human beings. Like you think with twenty people stuffed together in a van for hours on end a couple of them might have a conversation, but you'd be wrong. What this is all supposed to be saying about America or honey I have no idea."
" what a movie!
",0.0,0.9858,2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I couldn't choose a better movie to start my new year. When I saw the trailer for the first time ( yes I admit I must have seen it 10 times more then ) I was already captured, and my expectations weren't disappointed. This is a great portrait of a generation, it talks about beauty and hope through little frame of a road trip going around without a fixed destination, except for the pursuit of money and the ransom that comes with it. But what makes this movie so magical is the relationship between the two main actors. The tuning breaks the screen, we feel the intensity, the impetuosity, the joy of a stealthy young love, grew up in an 'hopeless place', as Rihanna's song perfectly suggests. The soundtrack is also amazing, well interrupted sometimes with calculated moments of silence. Last but not the least, I was completely enchanted by the cinematography."
