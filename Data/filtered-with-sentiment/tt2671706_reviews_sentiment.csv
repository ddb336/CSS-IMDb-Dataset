It's a lot of talking.But it sucks you in quickly.He's a stubborn know-it-all.But what a performance. Not just Denzel Washington but his whole family does a fantastic job."
" Well done!
",0.3382,0.9503,2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,"As a fan of the play I was hesitant to watch it, afraid that it may Hollywoodize the story, but this wasn't the case. Denzel and Viola deliver great performances, and manage to make this a fascinating watch despite the limitations of the setting. Highly recommended."
" A nice adaptation of an important stageplay
",0.5574,0.7178,2021-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Fences was one of the first movies that I watched where I was immediately ticked off that the film was adapted from a play. Each piece of dialogue was uncomfortably long and I often felt it was gratuitous. Still, there was a clear benefit: the audience felt very familiar and understood each character and their motivations. Without the familiarity of the cast of players, Troy's reveal would have been much less impactful. We get an in-depth look at how families grow to be like or different from their parents and how families don't need to be blood-related, even in the most challenging of situations. Viola Davis gives a phenomenal performance that displays her being distraught as well as her resolve. I give Fences an 8/10."

" The difference between a film and a movie
",0.0,0.8299,2021-01-29 00:00:00,4,"Films and movies are they really the same thing? I suppose it depends on your definition or maybe you subscribe to whatever definition is online or suits you but for me they are different. For me when I think of a movie I think of something that calls in crowds and draws large ticket sales, at least in modern respects. Film on the other hand, and again this is the way I think about it, doesn't have to be good overall but must have great performances by one or more performers. Fences falls in the ""film"" category for me. The individual performances are fantastic but the story is just blah. If you asked 19 people who saw this film what it was about you might get 10 different answers and they would probably all be correct. I am a big fan of all of the main performers in this film but I almost shut it off several times. I found myself grabbing my phone and surfing the news instead of trying to keep up with the random shouting about oppression or baseball or parenting or providing for a family or adultery or war or war injuries or money blah blah blah. Watch it if you want. You won't feel good about it at the end. You will however probably say ""what the hell did I just watch?"""
" Fantastic movie

" I think I see the problem here
",-0.4019,0.9805,2020-12-10 00:00:00,8,"Austin Wilson wrote a play about a man of the 1950s (or the first half of the 20th century, more broadly). Denzel filmed it as a play about that man of the 1950s/20th century. But the people who buy tickets to see movies in 2016 have no more concept of the being alive in the 1950s than they do of being alive in 1850, 1750 or 1650. Never mind being BL@CK and alive in the 1950s.Troy Maxson represents the difficult transition from huge sharecropping families to the fractured families of the industrial north. From fighting for their own freedom in America to getting their heads ''half blown off"" fighting the war in Europe. From being barred from professional sports because of skin color to being recruited for college on football scholarships. There's much more, of course, both explicit and implied. But you have to pay attention.Maybe it helps to have had a father very much from the middle of the 20th century. Who faced discrimination. Who had to work hard for every scrap. Who understood responsibility. Who had to sacrifice. Who was distant. Who was demanding. And yes, who was flawed.This is a deeply intelligent and thoughtful character study faithfully brought to life by Denzel. I mean, I am as white as a snowdrift but I had no trouble seeing Troy Maxson as a fully realized man. You rarely see that in movies in the first place. And these days, forget it. People wanna see super-heroes and happy endings.The musical bed was so subtle I barely remember it. Which means it was probably top of the class. There is a complete lack of obvious Hollywood ''here's how to feel now"" shmaltz. The supporting characters were uniformly excellent. Maybe a half-point deduction for the ''magical n3gro"" trope represented by Uncle Gabe overall and certainly in his scene at the end. Personally, i don't think the movie needed it.I feel profound sadness for people who were looking for a sympathetic protagonist or were bored by the pace. I was riveted."
" An endearing drama with winning performances.....
",0.5267,0.899,2020-11-15 00:00:00,6,"Based on a Pulitzer prize winning play of 1985, ""Fences"" is an endearing drama of a black working class man and the upheavals of his relationship with his wife and children. The film offers some excellent interludes of dialogues giving the essence of a play, powered by excellent performances of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, both nominated for the Oscars. Rather than on a plodding whole, the film impresses in instances like the emotional clashes between Denzel Washington with his son over quitting the job for joining football or the emotional outbursts of Viola Davis. The dialogues are pretty long, but these hold much of the attention. The biggest flaw of the film remains its pace and incoherence which fails to keep up the audiences unlike ""Help"" or ""Moonlight.""Rating: 2 stars out of 4"
" Fairly difficult to rate this.
",-0.3612,0.8114,2020-11-13 00:00:00,6,"Not sure how many stars this should get to be honest. It's a decent character study, but feels unwieldy at times... not sure it hits the right spots, feels episodic and ""choppy""... the direction is pretty good, writing as well.... Danzel is alright, it's just that the theme feels a tad generic and the production isn't anywhere near it could have been. Also the conversations between the father and son feel repetitive after a while..."
" Wow
",0.5859,0.9971,2020-11-04 00:00:00,9,"Denzel Washington is truly a fantastic actor, and never has this been more perfectly demonstrated than in 'Fences'. His performance in this was the best I've seen him. So engaging, so well done, so involved. I couldn't take my eyes off of him and was hanging on every word. It really was fantastic, watch this film purely for his performance and you won't be disappointed. Viola Davis was of course incredible as Denzel's wife, and thoroughly deserving of her Oscar for this performance. The interactions between the two of them felt so real, so visceral, so meaningful and poignant. Two greats at their peak in my opinion.The story that Fences tells is fantastic. A very personal, uncomfortable yet uplifting look into the life of this family, with the focus on their flawed patriarch. The story explores key themes of family, race, relationships (the father - son relationship being a focus), the American dream, the purpose and meaning of life. There's a lot to dig through and digest after watching Fences that's for sure, as delivers power and beauty in equal measure.You can also definitely tell that it is based off of a play. They can't have changed too much as it feels like it's been lifted straight off the boards, with plenty of dialogue and the action confined to a small set. Not that is bad at all. They recreate the close and contained atmosphere of the theatre, the closeness to the characters and the emotion, and do it so well. You feel as involved as you do in the theatre without leaving the sofa!I absolutely loved it, and if you love stellar acting, accomplished story telling and intriguing characters, you will surely love Fences too."
" BLM target
",0.0,-0.8156,2020-10-19 00:00:00,6,"Oh, dear. The paternalistic way the father (DW) was building (however imperfectly) his son's character was a great example of the traditional father, the normal family; you know, the people, that BLM want to destroy. This black 1950's family was rich compared to us; he worried about the cost of repairing the roof -- ergo they OWNED the house. I was jealous of him having such a problem: we white Irish had no such luck -- it was rented rooms all our childhood. I'm just looking at the film through the eyes of my own experience. Two booooring hours in. There's a Jesus plate on the kitchen seal; she's in Church. Lack Lives Marxists are going to hate that. Can I take another 45 minutes?? No, stopped with 35 mins to go."

Though set in a working-class Black neighborhood in 1950s Pittsburgh, the themes it explores are timeless and universal.Yes, the film is mostly dialogue. But so what? It happens to be some of the best dialogue ever written! And it fully fleshes out the characters as three-dimensional human beings. What were you expecting? Action scenes a la UNSTOPPABLE?

" What a movie
",0.0,0.9357,2020-08-02 00:00:00,9,"An former frustrated baseball player lives his life as a garbage man looking only to support his family and throughout the movie it will present to us the relationship between Troy and the members of his family.
There's many reasons why I can rate this movie a 9 and here's some that u can catch at the first view.
Troy is a man attached to his past and all decisions that he made and all his views about the world were 100% influence by his past and all he had to live in. It's easy to symphatize with this character although it's equally easy to disapprove his actions and attitudes when evolve some actions that he had done with some members of his family. This easy symphatize is achieve because the writers and the director had the wisdom to give us his point of view and that make us understand it.
At the end of the second act to the third we are presented with an rollercoaster of emotions. It has been past some time and now things change and life went by. Everyone took different and one thing that I really appreciate is the fact that the metaphors didn't disappeared. The third act is very emotional. As the time goes by we will be presented with the feeling that something is missing, that maybe some issues should had been resolved and it wasn't because of the pride.
Rose is an incredible profund character. In my point of view she plays two parts. The audience part and off course the role she ment to be. With her we get to acknowledge that maybe the opposites of the story are in fact quite alike, and with her we are able to feel all the emotions that the movie have to offer. Viola Davis gave us the performance that we really don't deserve, but we need it. Rose is the sould of the movie and she carries out the 3rd act. Viola give us the true look when she's happy, sad or even worst when she's disappointed.
I like the fact that the redemption went in such an moving and not such direct way.
The only thing that I might criticise about this movie is some dialogue's that are too long and helps to much the audience understand every metaphor. I would prefer that the director had the courage to give the audience the opportunity to understand by themselves."

" Sadly, a boring film
",-0.6249,0.696,2020-06-12 00:00:00,1,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but an episode of BBC soap Eastenders wasn't it.It's a family with an overbearing (not abusive) character of a dad. Washington's character loves to speak all day long about himself and his opinions. He was something in baseball before becoming a bin man. He complains about not getting far in baseball because of his colour etc (we assume there were different leagues for black/white players, we're not told). Every other word he utters, has baseball related terms. BORING! Rose his wife looks miserable and downtrodden, probably due to his overbearing personality. We don't know if she works too.I wanted to like it, but it was like watching a too long stage play (which it was), with actors just saying their lines. There was no feeling of warmth towards the characters (except Cory and Lyons). Davis overacts so badly: she's either sad and miserable looking but the scene with tears and smiles as she talks of love is hilarious. It's just so overdone. As for the final scene - what the heck was that!If you like a family drama where not much happens except emotions, a few arguments, and some very over the top acting (from the two leads) then this is for you. Me; I can get this at home!Loved hearing Dinah Washington."

" Should have been kept a play
",0.34,0.4118,2020-03-23 00:00:00,6,Fences should remain as a play rather than being made into a film.It's very stagey. Well-acted but I lost interest from the mumbly opening.
" Everything that boy do, he do for you.
",0.0,0.9711,2020-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Denzel Washington and Viola Davis can only be a recipe for a good movie. That's what i said to myself when I saw the cast of Fences. And it was the last movie of 2017 best picture nominations which I haven't seen yet. So I had enough reasons to give it a try.
If there is one thing to be said about this movie is this: Viola Davis is superb. Her acting gives you chills. It is that good. Her oscar was really well deserved. I really can't put into words how good she is. The movie is basically plain dialog so you can understand that the whole cast did a great job.
But the most complex character is Denzel's Troy. He seems to love his wife very much and it seems they really have good relationship...untill you find out he is cheating on her. At first he looks like a really good father figure, working man, providing for his family. But suddenly he seemed to me just like someone with a big drinking problem, trying to project his life ambitions on his son in a very agressive way. Or more like he was trying to prevent his son to be more succesfull than him. Cory was a succesfull man in the end. But was it all worth it? At the end he just hated his father for all he did."
" Denzel's exercise in Redundancy
",0.0,0.7063,2020-02-29 00:00:00,1,"Movies were invented because plays suck. We have the invention of the camera with all its capabilities because watching people confined to a stage is boring. So there's no more bland, superfluous use of a camera than photographing a stage play - the very problem with early movies from cinema's first few decades, and the only modern instance I can think of that pulled off the formula successfully was Glengarry Glen Ross. What I'm saying is, What was the point of this plain, TV-flat, boring video that does nothing to move beyond the limitations of its source material? Denzel directs and stars in this, not even 'adaptation', but straight-up direct photographing of August Derleth's play. The actors mostly talk/yell, pace around the house that the vast majority of the story is confined to, dramatize in classic stage fashion, familiar family melodrama unfolds - y'know, a play. Same exact formulaic flatness as all those Willaims/Miller/O'Neill's you probably had to read in high school or college. This pretty much only exists as boring homework for Acting teachers to assign to their theater class."
" (Press) Play
",0.34,0.9768,2020-02-15 00:00:00,8,"When it comes to acting pieces (movies), this one can be seen as an example or how to or whatever you want to call it. Denzel is a powerhouse, but everyone else holds their own. This is really powerful stuff and every scene is mesmerizing and really holds a lot of tension. I do think that at places the pacing might be a bit off, but overall that is just nit picking.If you like dramas, this will do the trick. Also if you are into character pieces. Our main protagonist is flawed - actually that is an understatement. The fact that Denzel is playing him is quite the neat trick. You'll forgive him certain things .. it's Denzel after all right? But the character he's playing ... not an easy one to love. And yet he achieves that - it's Denzel after all (his wife is at least equally as good and as I said above, everyone acts their heart out)"

Starring Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Jovan Adepo, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Russell Hornsby, Mykelti Williamson, Saniyya Sidney. (PG-13)Film version of the Pulitzer Prize-winning August Wilson play (adapted by Wilson himself before his death, with additional uncredited work from Tony Kushner) is stagy to the point of distraction--rarely has cinematic equivalency felt so unambitious. Character study of a working class black family in the 50s is a good one, and it's performed with intense pride and commitment by the whole cast (showy at times, but forgivably so). Some of the meatiest movie roles that either Washington and Davis have ever tackled--they both previously nabbed Tonys for starring in the Broadway revival, and the latter won an Oscar--and the material they work with is often powerful, though it can also become long-winded and overwrought; scenes sometimes drag on beyond the moment that the point is made or emotion is reached, demonstrating that some things, which work just fine on stage, can become clumsy and meandering on screen. Far more savagely prudent editing could've elevated this one to near-great status, but as is, the parts that work tremendously well outweigh the unfortunate filler.69/100"
" GOOD
",0.4404,0.9896,2019-12-09 00:00:00,8,"As I read the play I kept repeating the same thing over and over again to myself, ""this book is soo boringgg."" This play brought immense boredom to me and I would get sleepy every time we read it. I didn't really understand what was going on and there were times where I would stop and ask myself, "" What is truly the message behind Troye acting like this."" I was too focused on getting the book over with that I missed the most important details because I was just so uninterested in the play.
After we finally finished the book, we were finally going to watch the movie ""Fences"" written by August Wilson and directed by Denzel Washington. When the movie first began playing I was a little disappointed on who was playing the role of Troy Maxson because throughout the whole book I had a different image on how Troye looked and his body structure. Whereas the other actors of Fences I believed suited the roles. My favorite actors throughout the whole movie was Viola Davis also known as Rose and Mykelti Williamson, made a perfect match for the role of Gabe. Through the acting of Viola, I was able to feel her pain and betrayal on Troy's behalf. The role of Gabe was a pretty sad role, but Mykelti did a great job playing the role. I was able to truly see the deep affects the injury had on him and the effect it had on Troy's family. The overall production of the film ""Fences"" was truly amazing I believe that Denzel Washington wasn't what many expected to play the role of Troy, but he still played it off amazingly. The scene that has the most meaning to me is when Rose tells Troy ""this child got a mother, but you're a woman less man."" This scene is really empowering on how women should get back on their feet from a betrayal like Troy's. Small details like this I missed when reading the book I felt like nothing was catching my attention and I'm just a person that really likes to see pictures so I believe the film really was fenominal on how it focused on many issues that are not as relevant today, but it was once a part of history.

" A Performance Driven Film.
",0.0,-0.8849,2019-12-09 00:00:00,8,"""Fences"" is a movie adaptation of a play. Denzel Washington directs a performance driven film while also having to play Troy Maxson, a father of a family with many tribulations. Viola Davis (Rose Maxson) plays alongside Denzel as his wife. Every Friday, which is payday, we see Troy Maxson in his backyard with his two best friends, Bono (Stephen Henderson) and a bottle of gin. Rose will accompany them at times to hear Troy talk everyone's ear off and Lyons (Russel Hornsby) would be there at times as well to collect some of Troy's paycheck. Through the talks in the yard we see how perverted and even miserable Troy is at times. He steers his long winded conversations from what he will do to Rose to how he has ""wrestled with death"". Every routine payday chat brings Troy closer to his actual wrestle with death.
Troy's toxic combination of masculinity, ego, and pain is his undoing as a father and a husband. He subconsciously pushes the pain he felt as a child from his father to his children. Troy will constantly refuse to let Lyons borrow money and the only thing that would change his mind is Rose. At one point in the play his other son Corey (Jovan Adepo) asks him Troy if he likes him. Troy answers with questions such as: ""You got clothes on your back?"", ""You eat everyday?"", ""You got a roof over your head?"". Troy tells Corey that he doesn't have to like him because he has everything he needs. This creates resentment from Corey and is a start to future altercations between him and his father. His undoing as a husband isn't seen until the end of the movie where Viola Davis performs a truly heartfelt scene. Nobody cries on-screen like Viola Davis. The pain from the text in the play is mirrored so well on the screen, I got chills. Speaking of amazing acting, Mykelti Williamson who plays Gabriel should not be overlooked. Gabriel is a disabled war verteran which is not an easy character to play but Mykelti does it perfectly. Mykelti humanizes Gabriel and bring his delusions to life without any form of mockery.
'Fences' is one of the few plays brought to the big screen that wasn't warped because it became too cinematic. Some of the setting and lines were changed for purposes of the movie but the movie is very 'stagey', in a good way. This movie gets a higher rank from me than its 7/10 from IMBD, I would give this movie an 8/10. It would've received a higher rank if Denzel hadn't changed some scenes such as the ending. In the play before Troy's funeral, Gabriel was dancing to the sky after telling God to open his doors for Troy. Gabriel didn't dance in the movie but only showed his gratitude after his horn finally made sound after several attempts. Another fault of the movie also falls into a character category but this the fault is with Lyons. I feel like as if his character in the movie isn't portrayed as importantly as it is in the book. In the book we get the misunderstanding of Troy and his sons as well as their resentment for him but in the movie Lyons in a way is just there, he's just a character without much importance. Aside from the few disliked details, this movie is no epic story such as many other box office movies like Spider-man or Black Panther but it's a story told epically.

" Amazing display of August Wilson's book Fences.
",0.5859,0.97,2019-12-09 00:00:00,9,"Recently I have watched the movie Fences, and I honestly believe the movie is outstanding in the way it is ""true to the text"". This movie is based on the book ""Fences"" By August Wilson. About how a man named Troy Maxson who is a Garbage man. A man with two kids and a wife who built a fence to keep his family in, and simultaneously breaks the fence down through his actions.Directed by Denzel Washington, Fences was filled with world class actors who can truly bring out the emotions the book was trying to convey. Set in a small house in 1950's Pittsburgh. With the movies main focus around Denzel Washington, the delusional father and Viola Davis, the strongest women who were the actors who truly conveyed their acting skills so well, you get the feeling that they are the characters themselves.One actor that really shined in the movie was Lyons(Russell Hornsby). Throughout the numerous times he was mentioned in the book, I expected that his conversations with Troy were a little more lax and not so serious. But as we have seen in the movie the conversation where he was arguing with Troy was a lot more serious and really changed how I viewed Lyons as a character.Through the slight changes between the book and the movie (Seeing Troy at the bar/work/inside the house) they bring upon a massive impact on the way the movie feels. When we see Troy(Denzel) At the bar we are able to see the change in how the interactions with other people changes. At the beginning of the play Troy always had Bono(Stephen Henderson) around him. Then after the conflict the separated Rose(Viola) from Troy we are able to see how he is losing the people around him. Sure Bono stops by the bar to check up on him but he leaves immediately without them sharing a single drink. Then when we see Troy at work, Bono also worked with Troy at the beginning and the same thing happened as the bar. He got promoted to a driver and couldn't work with Bono since they kept moving him around from place to place.One of the amazing things about the book and the movie is relatability. The fact that we are able to see what is happening in the book before our eyes, we can get a sense of feel that this is really happening. We know these things could, and most likely did happen in the 1950's. While watching, we are constantly in a state of either confusion and/or suspense of what i going to happen next which made the movie even more enjoyable.Overall the movie was outstanding in the ways it was true to the text. Also of how it was fully able to convey the emotions that were not fully clear within the book. The only thing that my have been slightly disappointing was Troy's interaction with Alberta and how it made him feel ""young and happy."" I wish I was able to get even just a small glimpse of how much he really valued Alberta and further depth of why she was the reason he separated from Rose.

" Stellar Performances
",0.0,0.9972,2019-12-09 00:00:00,8,"Pairing up Denzel Washington and Viola Davis was an exceptional idea. Their chemistry on screen was unmatched. Washington directs as well as stars, in the adaption of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play. The story unfolds in 1950s Pittsburgh, where Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) a garbage collector lives in a world filled with discrimination and where society places high expectations on him as a father and husband. He was once a gifted athlete, but Troy's life took a dramatic turn and his hopes for playing in the Negro League were gone. His brutal childhood that seemingly affects his sons Lyons and Cory (Jovan Adepo and Russel Hornsby) and wife, Rose (Viola Davis), shows viewers how the ""sins of our fathers"" have imprinted themselves upon Troy.
Fences is not only story-driven but dialogue-driven as well. As an adaptation, this film was very true to the text. The script was almost an exact replica of the screenplay. Though the action did not literally stay in one spot, the film's settings are evident in the way that almost everything takes place in one house, which is similar to the play.
Viola Davis as Rose was absolutely remarkable but I wish she was given more lines. I did not notice the excessive amount lines Troy had until I Washington acting. You would have not noticed that Rose was the only woman in the film. Her portrayal of Rose was so spot on, I don't think anyone could have played Rose, as well as Davis, did. One of my favorite scenes was when she told Troy ""I took all my feelings, my wants, and needs, my dreams ... buried them inside you."" From this scene, I understand why she got an Oscar award for her supporting role, because of her beautiful execution of Rose.
Let's also talk about Bono, Troy's best friend and his iconic line ""Some people build fences to keep people out, and other people build fences to keep people in."" Stephen Mckinley Henderson was not who I expected to play Bono. I imagined Bono, as someone was more aggression. However, after watching the film again, I noticed that having a character with similar traits as Troy would have been too overbearing. Bono in the book was depicted similarly to Bono (Henderson) in the film. He was a man of wisdom and Henderson, character was a perfect match.
Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson), Troy's injured war veteran brother provided both a comedic and serious tone in the film. Gabe, childlike speech gave a break from the heavy conservations, but it also showed how the impact war has on a person physically and emotionally. However, the ending with Gabe was quite disappointing. It was not the scene I had in my mind or in the book.
When we compare ""Fences"" to Washington's earlier work, we saw more originality and creativity. I honestly wish that Washington strayed away from the text and added more depth to the film. Even though it was fun reading along the lines, at some point during the film I became uninterested with the dialogue.
""Fences"" overall is worth the watch. It dives into the topic of the ""sins of our fathers"" affecting the lives of their children and their link with future generations. This film shows the viewers the importance of having a loving parent and the impact a dysfunction home has on children. Fences, definitely deserve a 4/5.M.F. P.D 3"
" Good movie if you like watching dramas
",0.6597,0.9966,2019-12-08 00:00:00,6,"On December 15, 2016, Fences, pg-13 drama film, produced and directed by Denzel Washington, and written by August Wilson hit the big screens. The long awaited film adaptation of the play Fences was here and it did not disappoint.
Fences is about Troy Maxson, a man, living in a time where liberation is in the air. The change from the 1950s to the 1960s turns out to be a difficult one as he is left a ""stranger, angry, and afraid, in a world he never knew and to a wife and son he understands less and less.""With a compelling performances from as Denzel Washington as Troy Maxon, Viola Davis as Rose Maxon, Stephen McKinley Henderson as Jim Bono, Jovan Adepo as Cory, Russell Hornsby as Lyons, ""king of the jungle,"" and Mykelti Williamson as Gabriel, a subtle but essential soundtrack, Fences is the rare movie that is better than the book. The attention to detail was well appreciated as it translated into an ending that was powerful and of so much substance. Even the way they showed time pass told a story. Between the sticking tongues out at each other and the meaning behind their looks, there was an unspoken family dynamic that gave the movie some verisimilitude.Just as Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) said, ""Some people build fences to keep people out, and other people build fences to keep people in."" That was a message well communicated as Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) built fences both physically and emotionally around himself and his family. He said ""You got to take the crookeds with the straights,"" but didn't take his own advice until it was too late. Luckily for him, Fences is a story about forgiveness and he happens to be the main character.Although the movie was pretty much verbatim, the movie made some changes. The biggest change was the change of scenery that doesn't really happen in the play since every scene was either in the house, on the poarch, or in the backyard. In addition, another difference between the book and the movie is that in the movie you get to see the reactions of neighbors when Gabriel yells ""better get ready for the judgement"" down the street. We also get to see how Gabriel is doing in the Mental Hospital, a moment we don't get in the book.
Fences is different from any other movie that we see today. General box office hits today are movies like Frozen II, Ford v Ferrari, and Joker, movies with fictional stories. Fences, however, is realistic. Fortunately, for me and many others the word realistic is closely associated with the word interesting. In my opinion, a non-fiction story entertains better than a fiction story because its something you don't see everyday.In the end, this movie deserves all the praise it got. Fences is a movie worth watching. However, its only a film worth rewatching if its something your into. This films fatal flaw would be its inability to draw in new audiences because it's a little too realistic. Other than that the film is great. August Wilson would be proud.Period 6 R.O."
" Fences
",0.0,0.9964,2019-12-08 00:00:00,6,"Fences is an interesting movie with suspense. Fences main actors are Danzel Washington, Viola Davis, Stephen McKinley, Mykelti Williamson, Jovan Adepo, and Rusell Hornsby. Danzel Washingston played as Troy, his role was not to be a good father or husband. Troy in a way did play his part of a husband and father to give his family their needs such as shelter, and food. But, he did not give them genuinely love like a husband and father should. Viola Davis played as Rose, her role was to be a Troy's wife and a mom. Rose treated her husband great, but when it would come to stand up for her son's she was not really good at it. Stephen MckKinley plays as Bonnie, his role was to be Troy's closest friend. Mykelti Williamson played as Gabriel, his role was to be Troy's brother, and seemed to be mentally ill. Jovan Adepo plays as Cory, his role was to be the youngest son of Troy and Rose. Cory seemed to be fearful of his dad, but caring for his mom. Rusell Hornsby played as Lyons, his role was to be the oldest son, and older brother. Lyons wasn't around much unless he wanted money. Saniyya Sidney played as Raynell, her role was to be Troy's daughter.There were a few differences between the film and the book. For example, in the book Gabe just seemed to be a calm person but in the film you can tell he is mentally ill. He would start yelling out of nowhere, the cops would stop him because he would be disturbing neighborhoods, and he would hallucinate. In the film Rose went to Troy's job to ask him when he was going to come back home. Rose was trying to say when was he going to start acting like her husband again, in the book Rose did not go to his job. Also, when Rose got the news that Alberta died she told Troy in the bedroom when in the book she told him in the yard.The actors in Fences played their roles very well. There was a lot of intense scenes with Troy, Rose, and Cory. I did not like how in this film, Troy was an ignorant person from the start to end. Troy never came to a realization of his actions and all the emotions he caused his wife and son to have towards him. He did not make up for anything that he did. I also did not like how Rose kept trying to be a good wife to Troy after what he did to her. Rose should've been stronger and left him because she did not deserve that. In a way, she was strong because she kept going even after what happened between them. Rose could've also stand up more for her son, she seemed to be a better wife than a mom. Troy and his son Cory had a very different relationship as a father and son. Cory was afraid of his dad, he did not feel loved by Troy instead he questioned Troy if he even liked and Troy did not even deny instead he started yelling at him.Fences plays a role in our culture, families might relate to fences. There are families that might not have great dad or husband. Some fathers might still be old schooled like Troy that did not believe that black men can succeed in life and be better than what they are. Some parents might tell their kids what they have to do in life, and not let them make their own choices and follow what they want to be. Troy did not want Cory to play football when that could have benefited Cory in his future. Some parents might not even approve their child playing football because of how dangerous it might be.

",0.2263,0.3377,2019-12-08 00:00:00,5,"It is the 1950s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Working class Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) works as a garbage man to support his wife Rose (Viola Davis), son Cory (Jovan Adepo), and mentally impaired brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson). Bitter over a denied opportunity as major league baseball player, tensions run high as Troy denies a similar football opportunity for his son Cory. Meanwhile Rose attempts to keep the family together.
I watched this film in class and in short this film just was not for me. It's really just an hour and a half of non stop talking mostly from Troy. I wouldn't have been able to sit still for this entire movie had I not watched this over the span of a week. Just like how ""some build fences to keep people out ... "" this play to on-screen adaptation keeps out any form of creativity in this movie. It strictly follows the play's script word for word with no deviation. Scenes that were not displayed in the play could have easily been added to the film to add more drama but no such content was to be found. Only some few scenes were changed like Gabriel visiting a gravestone, Troy visiting Gabriel in the hospital, and Rose and Troy sleeping in a bed together when the news of Alberta's death is given. This, in my opinion, is the""one time in my life I've got to say no"" to Denzel Washington as a director. Though that said, Washington is a much better actor than a director in the movie.
The acting in this film is outstanding. Viola Davis, Denzel Washington, and Mykelti Williamson stood out to me especially. They acted their characters amazingly, Williamson made Gabriel very lovable. Davis was able to show that she could play any character you gave her and ugly cry like no other. Washington was also able to take on the role of a bitter unlikeable man and execute it perfectly.
Though the setting of the 1950s of the film and play make it seem like ages ago, the main problem still persists today. Troy is a bitter man from his past experiences and because of that he projects his own experiences on to his son Cory. Though many factors stopped Troy from playing in the major league baseball, the only thing that stood out to him was the white man. This stays with him for a long time which we can see when he tells Cory ""the white man ain't gonna let you get nowhere with that football"". Even today parents will be scarred by experiences they had trying to get where they wanted to be and because of it they will in a way shelter their kids from having to experience the negative things they have. This movie/play shows just one example of this aspect of parent-child relationships.

" Fairly Mediocre For a Film Adaptation
",0.0,0.9901,2019-12-07 00:00:00,5,"The 2016 movie ""Fences based off the critically acclaimed play by the same name, proves that not every faithful adaptation can be stellar. With the film's dialogue being shot for shot the same as the dialogue in the screenplay, ""Fences"" proves to be an underwhelming experience at best. What made the screenplay so good was its ability to synthesize a realistic portrayal of an African American family, and managed to cram it into a screenplay without losing authenticity. The issue with the movie is its fear to venture away from the source material. While there were solid instances of this (i.e. the alter call scene, and the scene with gabe in the hospital). I feel as though the movie missed out on several opportunities for a flashback or scenes depicting characters like Alberta and Miss Pearl, who didn't have speaking lines in the play, but it would have been interesting to see.
Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington), his sons Cory (Jovan Adepo) and Lyons (Russell Hornsby), his brother Gabe (Mykelti Williamson), wife Rose (Viola Davis), and best friend Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson), were all brought to life quite impressively by the actors who portrayed them. However, while the emotion and tension of the play were all present, the delivery of the dialogue felt too piled on at times. A large part of Troy Maxson's character, comes from the fact that he doesn't stop talking. Washington's directing and acting highlighted this point, and then cranked the brightness to 11. There were many times throughout the movie in which Denzel Washington delivered his lines over the lines of other actors. This to me, did not seem in character with Troy Maxson. Maxson may be abrasive and crude, but I don't see him as the impatient type.
The character of Cory Maxson, portrayed by Jovan Adepo, also felt rather lacking. Not only did Adepo lack the physical build of a supposed 17 year old football player, but he also made the character of Cory Maxson feel more weak in comparison to his written counterpart. The scene in which Cory and Troy have an altercation leading to Cory leaving the house, felt like a complete 180 in Cory's character. He went from one second yelling angrily at his father, to the next looking terrified. When Adepo delivered the line ""You crazy! You know that?"" I was expecting a continuation of the unbridled rage that he was exhibiting towards his father, throughout the duration of the discourse. However, what I and the audience were greeted with were a shaken little boy., which felt totally out of place considering not even 10 seconds ago Cory was standing his ground against his father.
Ultimately, the movie, while by no means a masterpiece, was not a complete train wreck. The biggest point it has going for it was it's faithfulness to the source material. But, this could also be seen as the film's greatest flaw. One of the best and most powerful scenes from this movie, Gabe in the mental hospital, wasn't in August Wilson's play. If Washington as a director had expanded upon this scene, and wove a message about how society treats its injured war heroes, then that alone would have improved the movie drastically. Instead, Washington decided to go the ""safe"" approach, barely adding anything new to the narrative, ultimately causing the movie to feel more like a dramatic reading of a play, rather than a 24 million dollar production."

",0.6249,0.9962,2019-12-07 00:00:00,7,"This review contains spoilers.Based on August Wilson's 1986 play Fences is a very well put together drama that portrays the life of an African American family living in the 1950's. This film was directed and produced by Denzel Washignton, who also happens to star as the lead role. The overall movie was very entertaining with a great choice of actors like Denzel Washington as Troy Maxson, Viola Davis as Rose Maxson, Russell Hornsby as Lyons. With a few minor changes Fences the movie stayed as true to text then most other screenplays that are based off a book.Fences is about a family living in the 1950s with the father Troy Maxson (Denzel Washinton) facing the consequences of his actions while also fighting internally with his past. Rose (Viola Davis) having a very powerful women role and being the only woman in this movie until the end brings more attention to her as the main building block of the family.The movie shows the life of Rose and Troy Maxson and the struggles within their marriage. Troy has two kids Lyons (Russell Hornsby), from a woman before he met Rose and one kid with Rose, Cory (Jovan Adepo). The supporting cast includes Mykelti Williamson who plays Troy's brother Gabriel and Stephen Mckinely Henderson who plays Troy's best friend Jim Bono. For most of the movie Troy is complaining about how he was never able to have the career he wanted playing baseball because of his race. His son Cory is in high school playing football and is being scouted by colleges because like his father when it comes to sports he exceeds among the rest. Troy constantly tells everyone that Cory should stop playing football because in a white dominated business would never let a black man become successful in sports despite their skill level.We soon find out that Troy has been stepping out on his wife and later impregnated another woman. With this being one of the most dramatic scenes in the movie but it also happens to be my favorite scene because of when Rose tells the story of how her family is quite similar to mine. I connected so well with this scene because she says ""My whole family is half. Everybody got different fathers and mothers... my two sisters and my brother."" With her having such a strong role and showing a more vulnerable side of her life showing how strong she is to even be able to talk about it considering the situation she was just presented with. Later on in the movie the soon to be mother of Troy's child dies during childbirth, leading to Troy coming to Rose asking for help raise the child, Rose says yes because the child is innocent and shouldn't be blamed for the wrong doing of their parents. Even with her saying yes she also makes it clear that ""From right now this child got a mother, but you a womanless man"".With using such well known actors we expect more to come from then on the screen and honestly I wasn't disappointed with their performance. Every time I saw Denzel Washington in the movie it reminded me of his stellar performance in his other movies The Equalizer and Remember the Titans. Viola Davis never disappoints in any of her films and I know that whenever I see her on the screen I would automatically know that this film I was watching would be worth it.The problem that I had with this movie was it tends to jump around and does not follow a constant flow throughout the story with us not always knowing how much time has passed. But other then that I overall enjoyed the movie.I.K. Pd.3"
" Important depth but seemingly lacking execution
",0.1027,0.9592,2019-12-06 00:00:00,6,"I have read the play first before watching the movie and honestly they stay true to the text but watching it makes it seem like the executions is lack luster. How Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Jovan Adepo, and Mykelti Williamson portrayed their characters leaves a serious tone throughout the movie but it feels like more could be done -maybe in the background or maybe in how the sentences were stated- to have everything flow more easily. Still, all and all I was able to moderately enjoy the movie and applauded a bit when Viola Harris delivered a line in the movie that her character does not in the play that goes on the lines of When the sins of our fathers visit us we do not have to play host. We can banish them with forgiveness..."". Which is essentially the whole premise of the work and a quote by August Wilson, the author of the playbook.In this day and age, with the box office filled with such big name titles with big name actors, it is easy to see how this movie didn't do so well. But What the story teaches is very deep and really pulls at the heart strings. For instance, having to hear a parent say to their child that they don't like them and that everything the parent does for them is because it is a responsibility, makes one who is probably in that form of situation very sympathetic as they have either been in that situation or are currently facing that. in addition to having those who aren't in that type of situation think and understand how lucky they are to have a parent that does not view raising their kid as just another job that needs to get done.All-in-all, the story portrays a father in the 1950s and his struggles to fully get a grip on life and how it is affecting those around him. Having pushed one family out of his life and now still failing to keep hold of his current family. Cheating on his wife who still keeps him in the house as she has put years of her life. How he then gets a daughter and loses a mistress and a wife(Rose{Viola} takes in the daughter to raise but essentially divorces Troy{Denzel}), and then how he even kicks out his second son because he decided to stand up to his father. The movie is all about ups and downs but it is the final scene that drives home the meaning behind the play. That no matter who hurts you, be it your own father, forgive them and you won't face any of their demons.

" Fences.. The Film we all need to watch !
",0.0,0.5918,2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"I recently watched the 2016 film ""Fences"" which could be mistaken for your typical drama film but it captures the deeper meaning of failure, family, and forgiveness. Denzel does an astounding job bringing August Wilson's play for the big screen word for word.Taken down the streets of 1950's Pittsburgh to the small home of Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) and his wife Rose (Viola Davis). Within a few minutes of the film you understand why the book was so timeless with themes that relate to our lives today. The film is consistent with this eerie feeling of uneasiness that I couldn't quite capture reading the book. This film wasn't meant to be a big action film but an intimate story that leaves you to evaluate your own life and values.Denzel is known for his infamous roles as Malcom X & Bleek from Mo' Better Blues. I build this love hate feeling for Denzel playing this character Troy; unable to move forward from his trauma as a result hurts his family. He seems to come from a place of love but his actions do more harm than good. Alongside Viola with her impeccable acting of a heart broken mother who bears love. Together their powerful chemistry is undeniable and leaves you wanting more. TParts of this film I found dreading and unnecessary but there are extra scenes that make up for it. Troy screaming at the window to ""Death"" and Troy feeding Gabe (Mykelti Williamson) in the hospital. The camera panning in on the rose dropping and Gabe's trumpet. These tiny elements that bring this movie to life. Every detail means something. That's what I love about these kinds of movies. The line ""fences to keep people in or out"" leads back to the plot of this story. Troy pushes his own son Cory (Jovan Adepdo) away who he was supposed to finish building the fence with. By the end of the film the fence was built up and Troy was the only one left but weirdly brought everyone back in.August Wilson wanted this movie to be directed by someone who was black because no one can understand how to portray it. There's all a black cast but the story is universal. We all have hardships and we should forgive ""the sins of our fathers"" so we don't pass down that same hurt. We're able to break cycles and generational curses as seen with Raynell (Saniyya Sidney) and Cory.I give this movie a 3.5 out of 5 stars. I think everyone should read this play and watch this movie once in their lifetime and maybe watch it over to catch some things twice. This film will pierce a hole in your soul.S.G Pd. 6"
" A Relatable Story For All
",0.0,0.9989,2019-12-06 00:00:00,8,"""Fences"" is impressive in how closely it sticks true to the text. Denzel Washington does a fantastic job orchestrating an emotional, and relatable film. The direction, cinematography, and music prove Washington is a masterful filmmaker. It is not easy to adapt a stage play to the big screen, but Washington does a sufficient job, with only a few scenes feeling like a filmed stage set.Fences is a close-knit, intimate story detailing Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington)'s hardships and how they influence the way he boxes his family in. ""Some people build fences to keep people out...and other people build fences to keep people in."" - Troy's best friend, Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) describes perfectly how Troy's fence is symbolic of trying to keep his family boxed in. Troy's traumatic past with his father caused him to be cold, unapologetic, and reluctant to let his family - specifically Cory (Jovan Adepo) - pursue anything that is not guaranteed. Troy does not encourage Cory to pursue football due to his past failures with sports. ""You go on and get your book-learning so you can work yourself up in that A&P or learn how to fix cars or build houses or something, get you a trade. That way you have something can't nobody take away from you."" - Troy's reluctance to let Cory pursue his passion speaks volumes on the effects that parenting, or a lack thereof, can have on a person. Troy is imperfect, and Fences highlights this imperfection. Watching Troy deal with infidelity, it is easy to paint Troy as the antagonist of the story. Though, I think many men can see a part of themselves within Troy. Troy also cares a lot about his loved ones, even though he is not about to express it in the best way. In a conversation with Death, Troy states ""Alright...Mr. Death. See now...I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take and build me a fence around this yard. See? I'm gonna build me a fence around what belongs to me. And then I want you to stay on the other side. See? You stay over there until you're ready for me. Then you come on. Bring your army. Bring your sickle."" - Troy would die for his loved ones, and I believe that says a lot about his character. Rose Maxson (Viola Davis) is Troy's wife. Her unwavering loyalty to Troy despite his flaws is representative of her emotional strength. Throughout the film, Rose backs up Troy in circumstances that most other women wouldn't. She is the embodiment of a faithful wife. Some people may see her as weak for staying with Troy, but I see it as more of an indication of how strong she is.Denzel Washington uses minimalist cinematography with no crazy effects or big action, yet still creates a powerful film. The acting in this film is outstanding, and it is its greatest strength. Troy and Rose have incredible chemistry, and I think what stands out the most is that their relationship is relatable. Rose puts up with Troy's buffoonery for almost the entire film, but she eventually erupts in an emotional outburst towards Troy near the final act of the movie, and this is where Viola's acting skills shine the brightest. Her side of the story can definitely be found relatable by many women. The supporting cast is also solid, especially Stephen Henderson's role as Bono, Troy's right-hand man. Bono is a rational side to Troy's temptations with infidelity, and a great friend overall. Mykelti Williamson plays a solid role as Gabriel, properly playing a character that's mentally challenged (as weird as that sounds).The film has more than one setting, contrary to the play which only occurs on the porch of the Maxson household. In the play, I didn't interpret Gabriel as being a burden to anybody, but in the film, Troy is visibly annoyed with Gabriel, sometimes even embarrassed. The emotion is much stronger in the film than in the play, mainly due to the amazing acting. Everyone seems to be doing their best at giving August Wilson's words justice, and their efforts result in one of the most well-acted films I've seen. Fences is different from many general box office hits of today, because there is not much action and extravaganza. Fences is a relatable, emotional story that I feel everyone can find some enjoyment in. For those that enjoy watching good actors perform a well-written script, you will love this film.Period 3, JM"
" It wasn't too bad.
",0.431,0.9993,2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"Fences is an exceptional film that begs the question: What happens when a person fails to learn from the past and appreciate what they have in the present? It is one of the rare adaptations that succeeds in telling a profound story without changing the source material too much. This, juxtaposed with the spectacular acting of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, make Fences a very enjoyable film.
In Fences, the main character Troy (Washington) is a working-class African-American who tries to raise his family while also coming to terms with his life. Originally, I was skeptical of Denzel Washington playing a character like Troy who is supposed to be a big, hardened man who believes that ""Life don't owe you nothing. You owe it to yourself..."" but as the film went on, Washington was able to perfectly capture the embittered but responsible nature of Troy. Viola Davis is arguably the best part of this film. Though she was considered a Supporting Actress, she, in my opinion, is the heart and soul of the movie. She is able to masterfully capture the pain and grief her character Rose faces as a result of her husband's actions. One of her heaviest lines, ""I took all my feelings, my wants, and needs, my dreams ... buried them inside you."" perfectly captures the grief and pain Rose has experienced and will surely have you invested emotionally.
I must also commend the fact that Denzel Washington is not only the lead actor but also the director. His execution of the original screenplay by August Wilson was great. He barely took out anything from the original play and the things he did add on such as the montage of the aftermath of Troy's revelation adds more depth to the story and the characters. I can also appreciate the added sets Mr. Washington adds such as the indoor of the house, Troy's workplace, and the bar as opposed to just the yard in the play.
One of the best aspects of the film is its relatability. We have those questions about how to deal with our parents' wishes and our own dreams and when to listen to them or follow ourselves. The film teaches the lesson that ""You can't visit the sins of the father upon the child..."" and that we will not always stay in the shadow of our parents.
Another great aspect of the film is the dialogue. As mentioned before, the movie stays very true to the original screenplay and it is amazing. Troy's dialogues convey his tendency to tell tall tales while also fleshing out his character and worldview even more such as when he talks about how all he could offer to the world was his work. Rose's dialogues are even greater and work to show her motivations for staying with Troy and keeping her family together. The way in which Rose (Davis) and Troy (Washington) interact with each other shows a couple who have created a deep love and care for each other but also a sense of fatigue and yearning for more on Troy's part while Rose tries to keep him from straying. Troy's treatment of his son Cory (Jovan Adepo) shows Troy's embittered self and desire to protect his son from failure but also his own ego by refusing to listen to any other points than his own.
Although this movie is a wonderful film adaptation that stays true to the original material and is further strengthened by the magnificent acting of the cast. However, my one criticism of this movie is that it is not that exciting. Some parts of the film were quite boring, especially in the first few minutes of the film. I could barely stand listening to Troy constantly chatter about death and how great he was. I had not even heard of this film until I was introduced to it by a teacher and after I read the play in class. This movie is not one of the blockbusters you would commonly see these days like the MCU films or the Disney animated films. Instead, it flies under the radar and is quiet. Not much time or money is put too much into advertising like the blockbusters and that is fine. Fences is a hidden diamond amongst all the blockbusters we see today.
I consider Fences to be relevant film today. Its message and story are not completely out of touch with people today. The representation is always a plus with the mainly black cast. Even the story itself of familial issues and dealing with our elders who sometimes are so hardened and refuse to accept change or the fact that there are younger generations who could be better than them. Fences tells all of these stories.
Overall, Fences is a very good film. It is by no means that action-packed blockbuster most of us are accustomed to these days nor is it the most exciting, but if you take your time to watch, you will have spent your time very well. It is an interesting family drama brought to life by great acting from Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. It is one of those hidden gems that you won't be disappointed with once you encounter it.-JHPD6"
" Fences: A play, a movie, and a story
",0.34,0.9989,2019-12-06 00:00:00,8,"""Some people build fences to keep people out... and other people build fences to keep people in"" -Bono. August Wilson wrote ""Fences"" to open people's minds. Denzel Washington took August Wilson's ""Fences"" and built almost an exact replica, giving life to a 1950s/1960s African American family undergoing tension and changes. ""Fences"" is an intriguing movie. Its slight differences from the text allow the carbon copy to become a carefully formed diamond.The story unfolds in Troy's (Denzel Washington) job. We see Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and Troy chatting away as they collect garbage. This differs from the play since the only setting that is prominent in the play is the Maxon household. The subtle change in settings allows the viewer to immerse into Troy's life and experience his metamorphosis. Readers often overlook important events such as how the setting contributes to character development, but with the film, viewers are able to see how being in the kitchen or the living room as opposed to the yard contributes to the overall performance of the characters. For example, Rose (Viola Davis) is usually busy in the kitchen, which gives her something to do rather than just stand around entering and exiting the backyard. This conveys that Rose is a caring character who is attentive to keeping her family well, a prominent part of the story.Denzel Washington, a notable actor and director, manages to capture the intensity of a controlling father upon his family through his acting. Noting Denzel Washington's directing and acting skills in ""The Great Debaters"", he is able to immerse himself into the role of the character, almost becoming one with the film. As Troy Maxon seems to fill up the film, his incessant speech and the way he drowns out the other characters, portrays not only his controlling behavior, and Washington's formidable acting skills, but it also leaves the audience with a dizzying spell, wishing for Troy to stop talking. In the play, Troy's constant chatter is not very noticeable until you actually hear it acted out in the film. This helps develop Troy's character as someone who believes that he is always right, but in reality is just loud so that he can only hear himself while drowning out the changes occurring around him.In a powerful entrance, Viola Davis is able to capture a strong woman, much like in the movie ""The Help"" when she plays a servant in the south struggling to live and take care of her family: Aibeleen Clark. As Aibeleen, Davis suffers through discrimination and ardous treatment from her white ""boss"". Due to previous experience, Viola Davis is able to vividly portray her emotions and struggles to the audience. No wonder one could feel her pent up frustrations and rage spilling out in bitter tears when she claims through frustrated sobs, ""You take and don't even know nobody's giving!"" to Troy's infidelity in ""Fences"". To top it all off, she takes charge of the product of Troy's infidelity, Troy's baby girl, after finding out that Troy's lover, Alberta, died while giving birth. Despite being adamant against having a family where it was about ""your papa and your mama"", like hers was, Rose gathered all the strength within her to take care of Troy's baby because the child was not at fault for the sin of the father. Talk about courage! And who better to play out such courage than Viola Davis, a strong African American female actress.Bono's character was unexpected. I would have never imagined Stephen McKinley Henderson as Bono, but his acting completely engulfs Troy's best friend: someone that looks up to and looks out for his best friend. In the play, I imagined Bono like Troy, but slightly shorter and equal in body figure if not a little bit slimmer. After being able to see his character develop in the film, however, I concluded that McKinley Henderson is a perfect fit to play Bono.Cory (Jovan Adepo), Lyons (Russell Hornsby), and Raynell (Saniyya Sidney), all products from different women, but from the same father, each portray a stage of Troy's life. Lyons is the past, where Troy couldn't be present for his son. Cory is his present, a product of his comfort with Rose. Raynell is his future, the product of an affair. An affair which brought change and uncertainty to Troy's life. Raynell's presence is especially important because it demonstrates forgiveness and innocence.Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson) is a form of comedic relief (although it seems incorrect) when he provides a child's point of view, interrupting heavy conversation. One can't help but to feel sorry for Gabriel for what the war did to him. In the play, the stage directions didn't provide as much intell into Gabriel's condition as the movie did. The eerie music as Gabriel shouts ""better get ready for the judgement"" down the street resonates in the viewers' mind and leaves a solemn atmosphere.The Lion King is a movie that, like Fences, provides a sense of importance when it comes to family as well as doing what is right, or the next right decision, much like Rose did for her family. The significance of the film is that when change occurs, some will take responsibility and make something for themselves while others will not. One's decision depends on one's character and willingness to preserve one's family or what one values. In bad times, good morals. The film's ending could have used more detail from the text. I would have liked to see Gabriel dancing. Overall, the film was a great watch, but can only be fully understood if one reads the book first.Pd.3 FZ"
" The Truth Behind Fences
",0.3182,0.9798,2019-12-06 00:00:00,8,"If not exposed to much literature, many will be oblivious to ever knowing how the movie ""Fences"" came to be. A play by August Wilson became a piece of literature that is good enough to be taught in schools. However, those who have had the luxury of reading August Wilson's work may fail to see the truth behind it without seeing the movie as well.
As I read the play, I was enveloped with immense boredom and confusion. It was hard for me to interpret what Wilson was trying to convey. I frequently found myself looking over much of the play, missing the little things that in the end made a world of difference. I didn't understand the deeper implications of lines like ""You can't visit the sins of the father upon the child,"" ""You're living with a full count. Don't you strike out,"" and the song about the dog named Blue.
""Fences"" was first brought to life as a play. From there it took off, eventually becoming a movie. Unlike when I was reading, I became infatuated with the going ons of the movie as I watched. Instead of looking over what was happening, I was zeroing in on it, taking it for what it was meant to be. Lines like ""Death ain't nothing but a fastball on the outside corner"" and ""Some build fences to keep people out. Others, to keep us in"" started to resonate.
Actors like Denzel Washington (Troy Maxson), Viola Davis (Rose Maxson), Jovan Adepo (Cory), and Mykelti Williamson (Gabe) make the movie more enjoyable. The way they are able to portray their characters drove the movie by leaps and bounds. I was able to feel the pain and betrayal Rose felt. I was able to see the difficulties Cory went through. I was able to see the true depth behind Gabe's mental state. I was able to hate Troy. It was through the direction of Denzel Washington and the amazing actors in this movie that this was possible. As the movie played out, I noticed slight differences from the play. As the director, Washington must have done them purposely. For example, Troy making Cory put on his helmet when having a conversation about how many strikes he has, Rose telling Troy about Alberta and the baby in the bedroom rather than in the yard, and showing Troy visiting Gabe in the hospital. I asked myself why did he decide to do this? By doing all of this, Denzel emphasized these scenes, making me look deeper into them.
I've always been the type of person to take in account the title of a piece of literature as I read. Constantly asking myself why this title? Why is it significant? The most important part of this whole endeavor was, in the end, being able to interpret the meaning of the fence throughout the story. When Cory says, ""Tell Mama I'll be back for my things"" and Troy responds with, ""They'll be on the other side of the fence"" was the moment I realized its truth.
""Fences"" gives an inside look into the world of an African American family and strived to bring out the point that like any other family, we want to protect our own. Like many movies today featuring a predominantly African American cast, ""Fences"" did extremely well in the box office. When compared to recent movies, the conflicts discussed in ""Fences"" are quite different, but still relevant. If it weren't for the movie, I may have never been able to look back and enjoy the play.af6."
" Fences has outstanding acting, but not much else
",0.3612,0.9946,2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"Based on August Wilson's 1986 play Fences is an intriguing drama that portrays the life of an African American family living in the 1950's. This film was directed and produced by Denzel Washignton, who also happens to star as the lead role. While this movie does deliver some outstanding performances by its actors and is a refreshing break from all of the superhero films hollywood is currently pumping out, I believe that it will leave the viewer wanting more.The movie follows the life of Troy Maxson(Denzel Washington) who is a sanitation worker married to Rose (Viola Davis). He has a kid from a previous relationship, Lyons (Russell harnsby), and one kid with Rose: Cory (Jovan Adepo). The supporting cast includes Mykelti Williamson who plays Troy's brother Gabriel and Stephen Mckinely Henderson who plays Troy's best friend Jim Bono.Troy is a former baseball player, who spends most of the movie mourning the baseball career he could have had, but was prevented from having because of his race. He believes that Cory should stop playing football because a majority white society would never let a black man become successful in sports despite their skill level. Troy creates Tension when he prevents Cory from meeting with a recruiter for a college team. When Rose tells Troy about the recruiter, he just shrugs it off saying, ""It ain't going to get him nowhere"". When Cory confronts Troy about calling off the recruiter, Troy says, ""Like you? What law is there to say I got to like you?"", in response to Cory asking Troy why he doesn't like him.The character of Troy Maxson is a selfish, foul-mouthed, drunk, that cares little for the feelings of the people around them, and doesn't realize how his actions hurt them. This is displayed even further when it is revealed that Troy has impregnated another woman. Rose is completely heartbroken by this; later on when the baby's mother dies during childbirth, Troy comes to Rose asking for Rose to help raise the child. Rose, being the compassionate individual she is, says yes but puts Troy in his place telling him ""From right now this child got a mother, but you a womanless man"". We also find out later in the movie that Troy checked Gabe into the hospital, just so that he can receive a cut of his brother's checks. Even though he protested institutionalizing Gabe earlier in the film.Despite Troy being a despicable human, Denzel Washington's portrayal of him is absolutely stellar and when this amazing performance is paired with the acting skills of Viola Davis it makes for some great scenes. Rose is one of the most caring characters I have ever seen and Viola Davis plays her perfectly.The main gripe I have with this film is that it does not adhere to the conventions of basic storytelling. There is no real conflict and resolution, or protagonist and antagonist. The closest thing there is to an antagonist is Troy Maxson, and he's the main character. There is no one to root for so in the end you will be left feeling unfulfilled.For everyone that is a fan of the book fences this movie is perfect for you. This is by far the most accurate adaptation of literature into film. Only minor changes were made, but these changes are necessary to make the film more enjoyable. One example of this is when we see Troy in the hospital feeding Gabriel, without this scene Troy will be almost unredeemable and it would be hard to forgive him in the end.If you liked Denzel Washington in Flight or Remember the Titans than this movie is for you. Denzel pulled off another stellar performance that is on par with the other great movies he has starred in. Overall I will give this movie 3.5/5 stars. The acting is great, but the plot feels almost nonexistent.

" Powerful theme expressed through impeccable acting, but otherwise lackluster
",0.2263,0.9965,2019-12-06 00:00:00,5,"Denzel Washington's interpretation of Fences is poignantly reflected by he and his illustrious supporting cast, but lacks director input in a film that is almost a carbon-copy of the play. The movie's highlight IS the acting. Viola Davis' performance as Rose is spot on, maintaining an appropriately reserved persona for most of the film until her character is broken. Cory (Jovan Adepo) follows suit in an almost forgettable but note-worthy exhibition. Gabriel (Mykelti Willamson) adds an entirely different dynamic to each of his segments, and Lyons (Russell Hornsby) for just a moment stands out above all the rest for what is arguably the best scene in the film, unforgettably telling his father ""If you wanted to change me, you should've been there when I was growing up.""Besides a few memorable scenes, however, the film falls short of impressing the audience with anything besides the acting. As stated before, it copies August Wilson's play almost word for word. I was fortunate enough to have read the play before watching the movie, but would be concerned that for someone who did not, the whole film may, for the most part, go over your head. It should. Many times it will drone on and on through dull dialogues and seemingly pointless narratives, and seldom does anything to keep viewers captivated. When compared to box office hits of today, you could understand where the lack of admiration for the film comes from. Take Avengers: Endgame as an example. It is a film that well balances action, drama, even comedy, to attract the general audience, and perfectly culminates it's preceding films. By comparison, Fences carries on monotonously from scene to scene, without much to make it stand out.Although I am highly critical of this film, and would not recommend viewing if you have not read the play, I will not say it is bad. Although there seem to be many instances when the movie is on the verge of complete disappointment, it is often revitalized by compelling performances and stellar dramatics. These are the moments that drive the film, and keep the audience wanting more. If I could give Denzel credit for one more thing, it would be his mastery in connecting the life of his characters with his viewers. The scenes where we can see each person develop his character stand out. The perfect representation is Cory after standing up to his father time and time again. We can see him go from afeard, to bold, and finally daring. His last stand is just about the final piece of the puzzle to develop his character arc. It goes hand in hand with the universal themes expressed in Wilson's play, that we can step out of our parents shadow and not make their mistakes, and it is delivered flawlessly.Bowman, PD 3, CN"
" A solid movie with great acting
",0.6908,0.9887,2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"""I done learned my mistake and learned to do what's right by it. You still trying to get something for nothing. Life don't owe you nothing. You owe it to yourself."" - Troy MaxsonFences may be one of the only films that does its book counterpart justice. The two may even go hand and hand. Directed and starring Denzel Washington, as Troy Maxson. Fences is an adaptation of Tony Wilson's play of the same name. Taking place in the late 1950's and early 1960's, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the story follows Troy and his dealings with the hardships of his past, and it is reflected through his stern and emotionless parenting of his son Cory (Jovan Adepo) and his pessimistic and dated view of the world.""I done give you everything I got. Don't tell that lie of me."" Denzel truly gave the audience everything he had, as he delivers one of his best performances yet with his rendition of Troy Maxson. The facial expressions, tone of voice, pauses in dialogue. He performs the role as if he himself lived the life that Troy describes in pieces throughout the play. Dealings of the turmoil and trauma of Troy's adolescence combined with the crippling circumstances of his young adult life; Denzel seems to almost blur the line between himself and the role of Troy Maxson.""Ain't nothing you can say, Troy. Ain't no way of explaining that."" There is so much great acting in the film that it's almost overwhelming, and it wasn't just from Denzel. Viola Davis (Rose Maxson), is not a supporting character in the film and she wanted that to be known. She delivers a spine-chilling performance. It was as if every argument was directed at you. As if there was no screen, almost every word felt as if it were in person. The amount of dedication shared between Viola Davis and Denzel Washington, to these two characters is truly awe inspiring.The film had a lot of upside and there were some things that happened slightly different in the play. Spoiler alert: such as Bono meeting Troy at Taylor's instead of Troy's front step, as what would be their last conversation before Troy died. As well as the depiction of Troy following Gabe (Mykelti Williamson) around the cemetery. Also, when Rose asks Troy if he is coming home tonight, she goes to his job to ask him, while in the play she asked him once he got home. All the differences are all just slight changes of location, which have no real effect on the overall plot and acting. I just believed them to be interesting alterations. I only really have two criticisms of the film, which are that one they didn't display any of Troy's infidelity with Alberta. There wasn't any depictions of Troy's childhood memories that he relies on in a conversation with Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and Lyons (Russell Hornsby). These moments not being made was kind of a letdown because they could have added more climactic scenes that were missing from the story.The film and play carry a significant amount of importance as it alludes to the importance of not bearing the weight of your parent's decisions and choices and letting it affect your own life and choices. It shows its audiences that they do not have to follow the same path as those before them. This is important and relevant today, where more kids are following their own dreams regardless of what is said to them by their parents. That they can create their own paths and not be bound to the lives that their parents lived. Or let the actions of their parents decide their own actions.

" Good movie, a bit disappointed
",-0.0516,0.9978,2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"This movie can be described as underwhelming. Fences (2016) is an adaptation of August Wilson's play Fences. It is very true to the play, almost exactly the same. However, Denzel Washington's acting is not as passionate as I felt it was in the play. Denzel Washington's performance was good, but it felt watered-down compared to Troy in the play. Denzel's acting was not as passionate in this film, as it was in his previous films. As a director, Denzel did a very good job. The scene where Lyons (Russell Hornsby), Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson), and Troy where standing and drinking together while Troy talked about his father was an interesting scene. The way the camera spun around the characters made if feel as if the stories were connected, like a cycle.
Viola Davis' acting was amazing and I was thoroughly impressed with her adaptability to different roles. Her acting was passionate and she portrayed Rose perfectly. Every emotion I felt while reading the play, Viola enacted it on the screen. Her performance was jaw-dropping, especially during the scene where Troy told Rose he was having another child. In the play, when Rose expresses how she truly feels to Troy, ""I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you. I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it. I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom! And it didn't take me no 18 years to realize the soil was hard and rocky, and it wasn't never gonna bloom!"", and ""When your daddy walked through the house he was so big he filled it up. That was my first mistake. Not to make him leave room for me"" was subdued compared to when I watched Davis' performance on the screen. Her cries added so much to the performance and truly brought the script alive especially when she said ""Okay, Troy...you're right. I'll take care of your baby for you...cause...like you say...she's innocent...and you can't visit the sins of the father upon the child. A motherless child has got a hard time. From right now...this child got a mother. But you a womanless man"", adding that devastating feeling to the viewers.
Stephen Henderson as Bono, Jovan Adepo as Cory and Mykelti Williamson as Gabriel were all impressive as well. Williamson's performance made Gabriel's lines feel more solemn than I believed they were during the play, but it wasn't a negative thing. Adepo's performance was powerful just like Cory's lines during the play. At the end when he greets Raynell (Saniyya Sydney), Adepo's gentle demeanour as Cory stuck the most with me. Henderson was exactly how I pictured Bono in the play.
Compared to the box office hits of today, Fences shows the imperfect side of families, a taboo topic. The acting is remarkable and it stays very true to the script, unlike many book-to-movie adaptations.bowman

" My View on Fences
",0.0,0.9988,2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"I would rate the movie Fences three and a half out of five stars. In the movie, Denzel Washington who directs and plays Troy Maxson is a former baseball player. Who spends his day on the porch rambling on and drinking liquor with Bono. Rose is troy's stay at home wife which is played by Viola Davis. She has won an Academy Award, Emmy award, and two Tony awards. Watching her act in Fences you could really see why she won all these awards. It goes without saying that no one else can play Rose than Viola Davis. Jim Bono played by Stephen Henderson is Troy's best friend and is around most of the time.When reading the book, I imagine certain things would be different like how I imagine Bono(Stephen Henderson) looking younger than how he does in the book. Also, I thought the porch would be bigger. Instead of a porch, it seems like its taking place in a backyard. In the movie. they added a montage to add to the moment after Troy and Rose's argument. The movie even deletes some scenes from the play. For instead, when Cory was on the phone.What I liked most about the movie was watching everything play out from the book. When you watch Rose(Viola Davis) and Troy(Denzel Washington) act out their parts. You can feel the intense, sadness, and happiness that goes on in the movie. For example when Rose says ""I took all my feelings, my wants and needs, and dreams, and I buried them inside you. I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it. I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom! And it didn't take me no 18 years to realize the soil was hard and rocky, and it was never gonna bloom!"" You could feel more of the emotion when watching instead of just reading it. When watching Jovan Adepo play Cory. I felt like he could have put more effort and emotion in.I never watch a movie with Denzel Washington starred or directed in. Watching the way he pulls together the movie. It was a surprise when I watch the movie and it was basically the same as the book. When Troy says ""All right, Mr. Death. I tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take and build me a fence around this yard, see? I'm gonna build me a fence around what belongs to me. And then I want you to stay on the other side."" I like the way the book put it in there. The metaphor for the fence made me have a deeper understanding of it. Denzel did a pretty good job putting this together it made me want to watch more of his movies. I also like how August Wilson the writer added a part when Raynell and Cory are singing together. ""Blue treed a possum out on a limb Blue looked at me and I looked at him grabbed that possum and put him in a sack Blue stayed there till came back old Blue's feet was big and round never allowed a possum to touch the ground."" That moment of them singing makes you realize the impact that Troy has had with them. It kinda seems to bring Cory and Raynell together.Even though the book and movie were good. I believe that the movie and book move quickly. Everything seems to happen fast. I hoped that they would be some flashbacks in the movie. It would have been more interesting seeing Troy past. Troy has an interesting past and the movie could have shown some moment of it.Music can be important to a movie. It can make you feel more of the emotion like how scary movies add certain music to add to the suspense of what's going to happen. In Fences, the music helps add more feelings about what's going on in the movie. Especially during the montage, the music made me realize how they were feeling.When thinking of Fences and comparing it to a blockbuster like Avengers Endgame. To me nothing can compare to Endgame, I grew up watching superhero movies with my father. In Endgame everyone has their own back story. If you follow the series of movies that connect to it you know everyone past and it all seems to connect into one movie which is Endgame. Fences doesn't feel like how a blockbuster feels. It felt more like a play than a movie. Blockbuster movie makes you want to rewatch the movie just so you can experience the movie again. It would keep you excited during the whole movie and wanting to see what comes next. I just don't feel like Fences could be a blockbuster.It wasn't bad to watch and it was kinda interesting. We get to see the character development in all the characters. I thought that the book would have at least more information than the movie. It was a surprise to discover that it was basically the same thing. This movie made me want to watch more movies with Denzel Washington and Viola Davis.SH

" Pretty Good
",0.7269,0.2379,2019-12-06 00:00:00,8,"*This review may contain spoilers*
Fences is a phenomenal movie with a cast of very strong actors. Denzel Washington who directs and plays Troy Maxson along with Viola Davis outdid themselves in these roles. They were able to bring out the best of the book onto the silver screen.
The movie follows Troy Maxson a 50 something year old african american man, who struggles to provide for his family, and all of the injustice he receives from a young age.
After Troy commits a serious mistake we start to see his family life tumble, and we start to see an end to his familial and friendship relationships.
Rose (Troy's Wife) who was played by Viola Davis plays such an iconic role in this play. Her most iconic line in the movie was ""From right now...this child got a mother. But you a womanless man"", this line is able to showcase the strength that the character Rose contains. Viola Davis was able to act this line flawlessly and show that the piece of hope Rose had, had vanished. Viola Davis was able to display Rose's character with such intense emotion that I couldn't help but get sucked into the movie, her acting was able to really grasp my attention.
Something I felt that was a bit odd in the movie even though it was a minor detail,was that Troy said that the fence was done towards the end of thge movie, if you really focus is the background you can see that it is not done. So the significance the fence played in the movie was thrown off. The fence was meant to display that Troy wasn't able to keep death out of his yard, and once the fence was finished that death would only come after him, which is why he finally able to die. But in the movie at the end if it when Bono tells Troy that he finally bought Lucille her fridge, we can see that the fence really wasn't finished.
Another iconic part in the movie was when Gabe(Troys' brother) played by Mykelti Williamson says "" Hey Rose. It's time. It's time to tell St. Peter to open the gates. Troy, you ready? I'm gonna tell St. Peter to open the gates. You get ready now."" and then he blows his trumpet with the mouthpiece missing. Even though the trumpet shouldn't be able to make any noise, once the gates of heaven are ""opened"", the trumpet is able to make a sound without the mouthpiece. This signifies that Troy was able to go to heaven despite all of his mistakes his ""sins"".
These ""sins"" played a part in getting the message of the book across to the readers and society as a whole. These sins that burdened Cory should not have burdened him in the first place, as what Troy experienced didn't necessarily mean that Cory was going to or had to go through the same things Troy did. A parent's ""sins"" shouldn't be passed onto their children, the racism that Troy faced didn't mean that Cory was also going to face a huge bout of racism too. This is the significance of this movie that what a parent experiences shouldn't hold back your loved ones because of fear, this something that today's society has to hear as most parents will push this fear onto their offspring..
Also considering Fences isn't part of a mainstream series, it did pretty well, but Fences compared to the box office hit of today ""Infinity War"", did poorly. Fences was only able to make 3 times of what was used in the budget, meanwhile Infinity War was able to rake in about 6 times that amount.
All in all, this is an excellent adaptation of the book, as it stayed very true to to it. This movie is highly recommended."
" Simple but very emotional
",0.3269,0.9848,2019-12-06 00:00:00,6,"Fences is a film about a man named Troy (Denzel Washington) who carries the burden of hardships he faced when he was younger. In trying to isolate himself from the world, he also closes in his loved ones creating an environment where no one can handle him. This film does an amazing job depicting the overall purpose of the book. I'd give this film a solid 6 out of 10 stars.
From all the book based movies I've watched, this particular film stays the most truthful to the book. There were no added scenes that we didn't read in the book nor were there any missing parts. Fences does an amazing job depicting the universal message of life, love, family, and parenting. We really get to see the family reacting to Troy's negative mind and how much his decisions and actions affect the family.
In this film, you get to see two amazing actors come together to create such an outstanding performance. Denzel Washington and Viola Davis made sure to convey the emotion needed for this film. When watching the movie, it all felt real. You could not tell the difference between acting and the actual feeling of dealing with the hardships that family members can bring home. Not only did Denzel Washington play Troy but he was also the director of the film. We really get to see what he is capable of doing behind the scenes and in acting.
Although the film is primarily based on the book there are some primary differences. For example, in the book we never read about Gabe being in the hospital and Troy trying to feed him. The film does an extraordinary job in depicting how much Gabe had changed since we last saw him in the scene. We also get to see how much it affects Troy seeing his brother in the state of mind he is. Another primary difference is the way the actors react when they find out about a certain situation. For example, Troy reacting to Alberta's death, Rose reacting to finding out Troy is going to be a father and the fights between Troy and Cory.
Even though this film was pretty good, there are some things that could have been better There were some things that I was expecting to be in the film that were briefly mentioned in the book. For example, I was expecting to see Alberta or at least the scene of her being in the hospital giving birth. The ending could have also been better. I felt like it ended too casually. It wasn't like a ""oh wow"" I can rewatch this again.K.F Pd.6"
" Wow
",0.5859,0.8799,2019-12-05 00:00:00,6,"!!SPOILER ALERT!!I think that this movie was phenomenal. Full with emotions amazing acting with great choices in actors such as Denzel Washington as Troy Maxson, Viola Davis as Rose Maxson, Stephen McKinley Henderson as Jim Bono, and Mykelti Williamson as Gabriel really helped bring the performance together. If you have read and loved the book by August Wilson then you will not be disappointed. Viola Davis' performance really brought her character Rose to life. There is always a difference in reading a play and watching the movie because it's common to assume a situation different from someone else. Denzel as the director and actor did an incredible job taking what he did on a small stage in front of an audience and applying it to the screen. While performing on stage you can't have the scenery changes so seeing multiple different location in the movie versus the play was perfect. In the play everything takes place on a porch versus in the movie you see the porch, the inside of the house, the commissioner's office, and Taylor's.
I know that when I watched the scene when Troy (Denzel) told Rose (Viola) that he was going to be a father to another woman's child it gave me a whole new understanding of her pain. I feel you can never truly have a real understanding until you see it for yourself. Pain and suffering is difficult to portray in a book but on screen it's much easier. When Rose said ""My whole family is half...It's your papa and your mama..."" Viola Davis' performance of betrayal was stunning.
This movie and book even though it was written in the 1980s and is based on the 1950s time period still applies to today. It talks about the struggles of family and being an African American in society and the workplace. Even though Troy was a bit ahead of his time it doesn't mean he shouldn't still try. The unfortunate fact though is that even after the civil rights movement and in today's time there is still a sort of segregation in some work forces. Not necessarily by race but even by gender. While watching this movie you have to process every little thing that is happening. I took what is happening in the movie and applied to my life which allowed me to feel more in sync with the movie as if I was apart of it.
The one thing that disappointed me about the movie was that it had line by line what was already in the play. Even though there was a difference in scenery between the play and movie. However, if there was a change in the script the movie may not have been as predictable. It may have been more interesting.Pd.3 C.H."
" If you didn't read the play, Your shouldn't watch this movie
",-0.2584,0.9981,2019-12-05 00:00:00,4,"The Movie Fences stars many great actors including, Denzel Washington(Troy Maxson), Viola Davis(Rose Maxson), and Jordan Adepo(Cory Maxson). It was thrilling to see how much these characters develop. However, this movie was made for people that have read the play.
Movies staying true to the text is very hard to come by. Directors have to make changes to the original text so that the film makes sense Although is realistic. Although minor, the setting has had a huge impact on the movie. The play is limited the Maxson's back yard. The director, Denzel Washington, uses scenes such as inside their house, the neighborhood, and Troy's job. If you have read the play you would notice the changes and how it makes the movie more natural, but if you haven't read the play you wouldn't think twice about the setting. The endings of the first act and the movie are also different than the original play. At the end of the first act in the play, Troy tells Cory that he has a strike, but in the movie, Troy has a moment where he instructs Cory to put his helmet back on and realize that he had a strike and that he ""shouldn't strike out"". Many scenes are symbolic because of Troy's past and character. He is determined to stop Cory from pursuing sports because he wasn't able to be successful. At the end of the movie, the family gathers around Gabe. Because of his war injury, the family supports Gabe's efforts to ""warn St.Peter to open the gates"" for Troy. The major difference in that scene from the movie and the play is that we see the clouds part and show a bright ray of sunshine that shocks the family into believing that Troy made it into heaven.
Denzel Washington was able to keep the movie true to the text, but this also has many drawbacks. You should only watch the movie if you read the play beforehand. It is very easy to not understand what is going on. The play relies heavily on symbolism to evoke meaning. Troy's character was portrayed well in the movie, but his past had a great deal in his habits. Unless the audience was playing close attention to all of the details, they wouldn't remember those crucial moments that validate Troy's actions. The symbolic aspects of the play would be harder to detect if you didn't read the play first. When Troy tells Cory to not strike out, or when Troy is yelling out to death, It would be hard for the audience to understand that what he really means is for death to leave his family alone.
The overall message of the film and play is the importance of family. We see Rose's perspective on Troy fathering child from another women, Troy's opinion of Cory's aspirations to pursue sports, and Lyons financial instability. The movie's significance is to show us that we shouldn't take what we have for granted. Instead of holding grudges, we should embrace the differences between our family members.
It is expected that movie wouldn't make much in box office profits because most people didn't understand the plot. The film Fences can't be compared to other popular movies. It's an adaptation of a poem, not an action packed superhero film. Although it was great to see some great actors redefine a poem, the movie should have an unbiased director, and much needed work. Better luck next time.

" A world of emotions
",0.0,0.9405,2019-12-05 00:00:00,8,"Fences, based on a playwright by August Wilson released in 1985, follows the life of Troy Maxson as he lives in a world that he seems to have major anger towards and we get to see just how drastically this affects his relationship with his wife and kids
Lyons (Russell Hornsby) and Cory ( Jovan Adepo). It's rare that a movie keeps the authenticity of the book it's written by but Fences does just that. It follows the script and changes nothing that alters the true meaning of the story. Rather it adds more character and emotion keeping the viewer at the edge of their seat. It adds the heartbreaking scene between Troy and Gabe at the mental hospital, the amazing performance by Mykelti Williamson that makes Gabe seem more ill than he is in the book, and the simple fact that the movie adds rain when Troy finds out Alberta died. Things like that adds soul to the movie.
The heart wrenching performance by Viola Davis as Rose makes you want to cry with her. When she states ""I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you. I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it. I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom! And it didn't take me no 18 years to realize the soil was hard and rocky, and it wasn't never gonna bloom!"" the pain and shame is so powerfully seen. No one does a crying scene quite like her. She plays her character through and through from her weakened moments to her strengths the moment where she states "" From right now, this child's got a mother but you're a womanless man"". You can truly see the moment where enough is enough from Troy. While reading the book it hurts to find out how Troy continually cheats on Rose, but the performance Viola Davis puts on makes you want to crawl into the screen to hug her. To give credit where it's due Denzel Washington does not disappoint. He does the complex character that is Troy justice. Whether it's his undeniable anger, selfishness, Denzel portrays him accurately. It's interesting to see how Denzel can for mere moments make you even feel bad for Troy. But he never fails to bring you right back with his never ending dialogue and captivating anger rants. Denzel as a director never distracts from the true storyline only putting music where it's appropriate and panning shots to see every emotion in each actor's faces. Despite all of this the ending for me was a bit anticlimactic as it was in the book from me. I feel like they could have showed Rose stepping up being a strong woman maybe appreciating Troy for the years he gave her but not completely forgiving him the same goes for Cory they could have showed more of the man he became.
But the story in this movie is timeless we all like Troy struggle to find our place in the world and when we are confronted with the truth on we often look to blame anyone but ourselves. Like Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) states in the movie ""Some people build fences to keep people out, and other people build fences to keep people in"" I think we all can relate to that on some level. We all have a natural instinct especially in today's world to protect the ones we love , to keep the bad things out, something Troy definitely struggles with the entire movie and play. I think they both show that we all have the same struggles but it's just up to us on how we deal with it. Although the movie may not rely on heavy animation, moving music, or dramatic effects like today's hits of Frozen, Avengers, Deadpool etc. I think it ends up working in the movie's favor as it shows real and raw acting.In the end, the movie brings the book alive in such a way that it pulls on your heart strings constantly. We see the the raw tears,anger,guilt and shame that the books puts through. That's why the fences is worth the watch it's gives you that and more.M.F.

" Fences is a familiar and new world
",0.0,0.9946,2019-12-05 00:00:00,7,"The 2016 adaptation of August Wilson's Fences, directed by Denzel Washington, was everything I expected going from text to screen, nothing more, nothing less, and I received great satisfaction in that. Following the original text practically line for line, we see Troy and Rose Maxson (Denzel Washington and Viola Davis) along with their family Lyons (Russell Hornsby) Cory (Jovan Adepo) Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson) Raynell (Saniyya Sidney) and good friend Jim Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) brought to life in their iconic manners. Troys retains his classic hard-headed and stubborn personality as he resists the reality presented by the rest of his family that he is a man stuck in time, the same time he refuses to admit even the mighty Troy Maxson has a limited supply of.
Fences(2016) immediately introduces viewers to a world that is both all too familiar and yet completely new. For those familiar with the written text, this is the universe that the reader longs to see within the book, for those beginning with the movie adaptation, this is the suburban city streets and town that some of us are used to riding our bikes around. The movie does a great job at balancing the introduction of a never before seen world with the original setting of the play, the Maxson household, practically wielding the home as the nucleus of the universe Denzel has developed. Despite introducing the various new settings, Denzel does quite a good job at still ensuring the scenes fit, never taking anything away from the events taking place. Denzel's wise choices of what decisions to omit are put to use right off the bat in the first scene. Choosing to change the setting to the neighborhood streets as well as the time to daytime rather than night, the scene doesn't lose any of the significance that it held within the book, if anything, it makes it more believable.
Denzel Washington's wise directorial decisions are not the only ones he makes for the film. While bringing the role of Troy Maxson to life, Washington makes it his very own, as do all the actors/actresses in the film. The small things, such as smiles and laughter are adopted in places where they're absent in the book, lending itself to the authenticity of the fictional work. While the film follows the book line for line, it uses the characters as a starting point, a frame in which they can elevate their performances past just the pages of the book. Viola Davis' performance as Rose Maxson is a direct representation of the casts ability to do so. Her acting transcends the pages, the screen when Rose receives the news of Troy's unfaithfulness to her. The way the tears roll down her face, the way her voice cracks when reciting the line ""I been standing with you! I been right here with you, Troy. I got a life too. I gave eighteen years of my life to stand in the same spot with you."" forms something in the audience that only the truly greats (both actresses and movies) can: emotion. While today's top films like Avengers: Endgame and Toy Story 4 can appeal to things such as nostalgia with their long standing franchises and generations of viewers, a film such as Fences cannot relate to those factors, Tony Stark's ""I Love You 3000"" just simply hits different than Cory and Raynell's rendition of ""Hear it ring! Hear it ring! I had a dog his name was Blue"", but that makes it that much more impressive that the amount of emotion conveyed within the film can be compared to these modern day juggernauts.
For viewers who watched the film because of their love of the book, their stance on the acting may not be as positive as mine though. I will admit, comparing it strictly to what the book was, I was somewhat let down by the acting. There were times in the film where I wanted to see the hardcore, dark, gritty, Troy Maxson created in the pages of August Wilson's play. The somewhat nonchalant approach to the story of Troy's father was just one instance where that desire wasn't fulfilled. I was expecting there to be much more of a hardened impact in the realization from Troy that the reason ""the devil had never come to get (His Father)...cause he was the devil himself."" Despite my initial reaction not all the differences in portrayals were bad. Gabriel's portrayal was particularly effective as he transformed the mentally slow man created in the play to the mentally ill and delusional person shown on the screen. In my opinion, it is easy to get lost in what the characters were, or are supposed to be if you compare the book and film as a book to film adaptation, but ironically I think that'd make us all like Troy, unable to accept that things are different.
Honestly, I feel as though the movie would have been much more disappointing if it followed the book exactly, at that point it would've been comparable to that of an audio book. The need for live action would be unnecessary if the characters didn't change at all, in fact for the movie specifically change is almost crucial. Since August Wilson wrote Fences, there have been various live action renditions through its intended medium of theatre, however I'd like to think that Fences cannot be conveyed to its fullest potential by doing the same thing over and over. Today we live in a world where what appears on the screen greatly outweighs anything else going on and influences our values. While I can't speak for everyone, I highly doubt that in today's society it is common for many people to go and actually read or watch Fences the play, so its newer movies counterpart is the solution to keeping Fences relevant and modern. With updated, slightly ""modern"" portrayals of the characters, the film does a good job of making the various themes of Fences relatable. Many people can relate to the strained relationship with a father like the one shown between Troy and Cory, Some can relate to Cory in his desire to just receive some sort of positive acknowledgement from their parents, it's one thing to read it, but to see it, to see someone actively portray your feelings, thats a different type of connection. I personally can relate to the internal battle displayed by Corey in the final scene with his need to chase out and deny what's left of Troy Maxson in his life, the need to rid yourself of the ""sins of the father"". Seeing Rose teach Cory how to ""Cut the world down to size"" to fit him and this ""shadow"" he's running from, it personally touched me differently. I wasn't just reading it, I was listening, seeing it. Watching someone talk to and console a character in which you can envision yourself as, it is almost as that character is no more, its you now, it's as the other characters are speaking directly to you, it was almost as if Rose spoke to me herself. The ability of the film to produce such a feeling is what makes it a great movie.
The 2016 film adaptation of Fences does what the written play by August Wilson cannot. The creation of a nostalgic world, and heart touching and authentic performances, Fences can be considered a very well executed book-to-film adaptation.Kyle.Rey."

Powerful performance by Denzel Washington.Seeing the actors, I was originally expecting a bit more. Yet, while watching the film, I noticed it was more styled in the form of a play. A different direction for other films I've seen by Washington, but an enjoyable pivot.Emphasized with all of the characters and understood their internal conflicts. This movie deserves more praise that what it received."

",0.0,0.9574,2019-10-21 00:00:00,6,"Great performances all around, and a really solid story - but this still feels like a high budget made-for-TV film. Not bad, but in the hands of a more visually interesting director, could have been loads better."
" Denzel & Viola take a bow
",0.0,0.7089,2019-09-29 00:00:00,8,"The overall quality of the movie rests heavily on the shoulders of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis. Both were exceptional to watch as on screen husband and wife and in the dialogue driven movie about resentment, anger, pain, love, forgiveness and an old fashioned way of thinking they both shine brightly. The story is powerful and the long speeches are effective at setting the overall atmosphere. Denzel performs double duty here too as he stars and directs and coming away from this film I realise that he should definitely direct more frequently. My only real critique of this film is that it does somewhat drag at times and could do with being 20 minutes or so shorter."
" When is a play not a play?
",0.5859,0.9953,2019-09-20 00:00:00,6,"So this is a play. I know they've filmed it and I'm not sure why, but it's still a play. You just happen to be watching it on celluloid. It makes it feel that it was done unnecessarily. Bar three scenes which are cumulative 5 minutes the whole piece takes place in and around Troy Maxson's (Denzel Washington) House, which he shares with his wife and and son. Maxson is a former baseball player that was never given the chance because of his race and now has to grind out a living on a garbage truck.
Maxson is reformed, (mostly) principled and engaging (to those around him) but is also loud, overbearing and damaged.
This can be established relatively quickly, certainly within 30 minutes you're going to have a good handle on the character. However Denzel (who directs this) uses all of the first two hours to establish these traits. He throws in a bit of plot so the characters wheel about a bit, but it's mostly ""here's what kind of person Maxson is"".
Maxson is not all bad. His intentions are good and he's fleetingly humorous but I didn't enjoy his company. Rose his wife says ""he filled up the house"" and he fills up this play. There's barely room for anyone else and everyone else is excellent, maybe not Lyons but everyone else. I just wanted a break from him. You do get one and it's glorious. Comfortably the most enjoyable section and because it's a little more ensemble, it works better and the other characters shine.
With the contrast laid bare it almost feels like the movie is self indulgent. Denzel takes on the role of legendary producer Bruce Dickinson, walks on to the set as says ""great, great but I think it needs more Denzel"". Like a cowbell? No it doesn't.
Well shot, well filmed, well cast and likely a good director in the making but I didn't want to spend two hours with Maxson and likely neither will you. SIX"

He is entirely believable as a complex character- courageous but a bully, affectionate and tender but also hard and nasty. He should have received awards. Viola Davis also is convincing.The script is entertaining and some of the dialog is brilliant- especially the humorous parts. But it is not a classic, as it has a bit too much melodrama, especially at the end.One good thing about the script is that it shows a number of different character-types in a balanced way. You see each family member through the eyes of the others, but each (male) seems unable to understand his defects that are obvious to the other family members.It would have been more complete to include more religion, as surely it was an important part of the culture- and this household, based on the house decor, but there are only superficial references."
" Think 'Death of a salesman'??
",-0.644,0.9291,2019-06-18 00:00:00,7,"Fences star Denzel Washington and Viola Davis and is a story about an African-American couple who tries to raise a family in the 50s. This movie exists to be in the Oscars, the acting and dialogue was unparalleled in how impactful and beautifully emotional it was. Fences is much collection on scenes that revolve around the central characters and focuses on having those impactful moments rather than a coherently strung together movie. That's not to say that the movie was incoherent but simply, continuity wasn't the main focus.This movie reminded me a lot of Death of a Salesman, the play by Arthur Miller that was then turned to film in 1985. It told a very different story in terms of the characters and setting but essentially, at its core it tells the same story about family, self worth and the American dream. I find that it is an especially interesting foil to Death of a Salesman given that one is about a white middle income family and Fences is about a lower income African American family. While the patriarch of the family have different hopes and dreams for themselves and their children there is a similar sense of both being 'dreamers' and looking into a brighter future, the core of the American Dream.In order to achieve this thematic exploration, Fences enlists two of Hollywood's best in Denzel and Viola Davis. The acting in this movie were full of life and painfully authentic, from Davis' ugly crying to Denzel's stern monologues. This is a film that celebrates acting and playwrights, a very interesting watch indeed."

The end was actually shocking seeing as how we all thought his brother was a little crazy. Turns out he might not be as crazy as we thought. I understood why his son felt the need to stand up to him. Troy made it seem like he didn't want his son to succeed because he himself could not do it.What Troy didnt want to understand was the fact that his son had a better chance at playing football than he did playing baseball. Times were different for his son and he was young and healthy. Troy tried to play baseball at an older age which is a reason why he failed other than racism.It seemed like Troy was depressed. Always going to work, not much time to relax because everyone needed him to make the money. Understandable why he was upset. Repeating the same cycle of unhappiness not seeing that times have changed and he could possibly do better. I feel as if Rose made her own earnings their marraige wouldn't have made it but that wasn't the case, thus keeping her stuck to take care of his child while he continue to work. They both made sacrafices to keep their home.It's not suprising that he died when realizing the many parts where he talks about facing death and how he stays ready. If it wasnt for the mother of his child's death i probably wouldn't have felt that bad for him seeing as he was a cheater anyway. When i wonder why Rose stayed it's either because she had no place else to go, or she truly loved him despite saying he's womanless.The lights that shown through the clouds as his brother blew the trumpet was amazing. It was as if he really opened the gate. My face was as shocked as theirs. Great movie."

" A theater play wrapped in a film's skin.
",0.34,0.9015,2019-03-08 00:00:00,6,"Before going into this film, I knew it was based on a play of the same name. Of course, even if I didn't know this, I could have told you it was based on a play. Perhaps that's what kept bugging me throughout this movie: it was clearly a play. I could see in my mind's eye how it would look on the stage, which wasn't helped by the actors' cadence and almost continual monologues. If I wanted to see this as a play, I'd see it as a play; I watch a movie to get a more well-rounded experience.So, aside from this film being an almost direct adaptation of the play it's based on, the next thing that caught my attention was how many tropes were contained in the plot. Honestly, with topics like mental health, marital infidelity, inter-generational conflict, and death, the plot didn't seem that original to me at all. Add to this, one of the main characters (Denzel Washington's Troy Maxon) who rambles nonsense half the time and just straight-up poor decisions the other half of the time, and I had trouble even paying attention to what was happening. Life cannot be so simply condensed to baseball metaphors.Of course, while many elements in this movie irked me, the total of their parts ended up being somewhat tolerable. This was mainly due to the stellar performance by Viola Davis, which earned her the Best Actress Oscar. By the end of the film, despite very few surprises, the finale is at least satisfying and fitting. I'm just disappointed that more of the extensive and immersive capabilities of movies weren't utilized to bring this plot a greater depth than just a one-for-one transfer from the stage.A theater play wrapped in a film's skin, I give Fences 3.0 stars out of 5."

Brilliant script, great storyline told at a relatively slow pace that never drags and wonderful acting by a tight small band of quality professionals. Yes it is stagey, an obvious transfer of a theatre play, but the fact that Denzel Washington in his directors role deliberately didn't utilise the increased scope that a movie allowed him says a lot. By confining it two rooms and a back yard for ninety percent of the time he creates a wonderful claustrophobic atmosphere and reveals how they are all trapped in their different ways by fences.

" Some People Build Fences To Keep Others Out...
",0.0,0.9906,2019-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Since viewing the film's trailer mid last year, Fences was a film that I have desired to see in cinemas (I had the same feeling after I watched the trailer for Logan).Unfortunately for me, Fences was released during the same week as Fifty Shades Darker, and Fences was pushed off the sessions times in many cinemas in QLD. I was starting to think that Fences was a film I was going to miss as it was only being shown in approximately two cinemas, both very far away.By luck, last week my local cinema provided a couple of sessions calling it a ""last chance screening"" and I finally had the honour of watching this new drama.Fences stars Denzel Washington as Troy (Denzel Washington is also the film's director) and Viola Davis as Rose. Before I go further, perhaps you are are not aware that Fences is actually based on a famous stage play which actor Denzel Washington had previously performed in many times. Denzel has always been a huge fan of the play and naturally developed the desire to transform Fences into a motion picture for the whole world to see. Because this is based on a stage play, Fences is a film that is very heavy with dialogue and requires your complete attention.The film introduces us to Troy (Washington), who is a husband & a father of two boys- one teenage, one adult. Troy works daily as a trash collector and has done so over the last 18 years of his life (you know, the normal Monday till Friday kinda job). His pay is handed to his wife weekly and they use the money to try and get by each week. His wife Rose (Davis) is honourable & humble. She provides a clean home, cooks meals, is welcoming of guests, attends church & supports her husband in ALL circumstances.Fences is a film that can make the viewer enjoy key moments one minute and then suddenly feel very uncomfortable the next. Happy moments between two people change suddenly with simple dialogue. The film does a great job of showing the many challenges this family are currently facing as well as explaining information about our characters past. The information about characters pasts also explains why they deal with certain situations like they do within the film...Our leads as you would expect are outstanding. The dialogue between the leads is quick, snappy and never fails to deliver an outstanding performance. While Fences is a heavy drama (even for a PG film) as audience members I feel we can connect & relate to this film in some way. Every husband wants to be a good provider for his home and the list goes on.The film doesn't have any real motion picture soundtrack. In fact, I think over 2 hours I heard 3 minor amounts of music (mostly for scene transitions) and the scenes are mostly focused within a home and its back yard. This all sounds very basic, but the good news is it's all very effective and feels real.At times you swear you are simply watching a stage play and not a film.

" Not of interest
",-0.357,-0.1165,2019-01-04 00:00:00,4,"A good film it might be, but FENCES isn't for me. It's a 1950s-era family saga about the volatile relationship between man and boy; he's a failure for various reasons and he's determined to see his son turn out in his own image. The film not only stars Denzel Washington but was directed by him too, and he gives a very enthralling performance, supported well by Viola Davis. Sadly, what lets this down is a script; it's about everything and nothing, and it goes on and on an on hammering the same point home. The character vocabulary is limited, the characters themselves rather unlikeable, and it's one of those films where very little happens too."

It's quite rare for me to 'forget' i am watching a movie, especially when watching a drama, but that is what happened here. When the movie was done, i immediately felt compelled to check the IMDB rating, and see if others were as impressed. Then seeing those amazingly bad reviews, which to my knowledge have no merit at all, i felt it my duty to make an account, and post a sincere review.

" Stage play to film transition could have been better, but this portrait of a tragic black Pittsburgh sanitation worker is still a powerful film featuring top-notch acting
",0.3291,0.9354,2018-09-12 00:00:00,8,"In the film adaptation of August Wilson's magisterial play Fences, Denzel Washington reprised his role from the 2010 Tony Award winning revival (originally starring James Earl Jones on Broadway in 1987). Here Washington also directs, working with a screenplay written by Wilson prior to his death in 2005. Tony Kushner was brought on to perhaps do a re-write but ended up only getting a co-producer credit. Apparently Washington was not too keen on too many changes to the script as he regarded Wilson's words as sacrosanct. 
A brilliant actor, Washington proves to be only a competent director as the film adaptation of Fences feels like a filmed version of the play. Early on, there is a nice scene of the protagonist Troy Maxson (Washington) and his fellow sanitation worker Jim Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson) making the rounds hauling trash on the streets of 1950s Pittsburgh,but the vast majority of the action takes place at the Maxson home, where the stage play is set. 
Somehow the film could have been expanded to show additional settings but that would have required changes to Wilson's original draft, changes which Washington was not willing to make. In addition, there are too many long-winded speeches that weren't cut for the film and slow much of the proceedings down (I'm thinking particularly of all those baseball references that seem to go on and on), 
Nonetheless, Wilson's material is so good and the acting here so fine that complaints about the over staginess of the film ultimately fall by the wayside. In the hands of a master screenwriter, sure the script could have become more cinematic. But where do you find a writer comparable to Wilson?
 Fences is a tragic vision of a man who suffered the indignities growing up in a racist America but was also his own worst enemy. Unlike agitprop about chauvinistic black cultural pride in (recent) movies such as Black Panther, Wilson isn't afraid to paint a negative portrait of a black man done in not by the external forces of racism but by his own hubris.
 Troy is a complicated man as he has many likable attributes. Chief among them is his hard work ethic. Despite being a raised by a father who continually beat him and ending up serving 15 years in the penitentiary for armed robbery, Troy straightened his life out and now is a sanitation worker whom isn't afraid to stick up for what's right, Labeled as a troublemaker on the job, he manages to overcome the discrimination he encounters and is hired as Pittsburgh's first black driver for the Department of Sanitation).
 But clearly Troy has a big chip on his shoulder, embittered by being a successful Negro Leagues baseball player but not selected by the major leagues since he was playing at a time before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. It's revealed however that he was already too old to break into the majors but conveniently ignores this fact when disparaging baseball for not giving him a chance. His pettiness is fully on display when he ""disses"" the current crop of black ballplayers whom he regards as having inferior skills to those he had in his heyday.
 Troy has an older son from an earlier relationship, Lyons (Russell Hornsby), a struggling musician who often comes by on Friday (Troy's payday) and asks to borrow small amounts of money. Troy believes in ""tough love"" and refuses to give him any money, until his current wife Rose (Viola Davis) intervenes.
 Much worse is Troy's treatment of his younger son, Cory (Jovan Adepo), who has the opportunity of obtaining a football scholarship but is thwarted by Troy, who doesn't want to see his son fail as he did, in an unsuccessful career in sports. At the climax, Troy and Cory have a physical altercation and Cory leaves home.
 Troy's biggest transgression is betraying Rose, his wife of 18 years. He confesses he's having an affair with a younger woman, Alberta, who is now pregnant. The big dramatic moment of the narrative takes place when it's revealed that Alberta dies in childbirth and after bringing his infant daughter Raynell home, Rose agrees to raise her as her own.
 A subplot involving Troy's brother Gabe (Mykelti Williamson), a mentally ill man who sustained a head injury during World War II, highlights another aspect of Troy's conflicts. He uses the brother's disability payment from the Army to purchase his house and later has his brother committed-again gaining money at the brother's expense.]
 Much of Gabe's dialogue is meant symbolically, as he is some kind of angelic harbinger (announcing Troy's entrance into heaven at film's end). Despite slow-pacing, the denouement clearly ends on a hopeful, positive note. When Cory tells Rose he doesn't intend to attend his father's funeral, Rose changes his mind, indicating that she has forgiven Troy for all his faults.
 In comparing a Tony Awards clip from the 80s of James Earl Jones playing Troy, I am much more partial to Denzel Washington, who seems much more believable as an ""American-bred"" character than the classically trained Jones. Viola Davis won the Best Supporting Actress for Fences due to her powerful performance. Special mention should be made of Stephen McKinley Henderson as Bono, who complements Washington as Troy's confidant and moral conscience (it's Bono who urges Troy not to cheat on his wife and hurt her).
 In the hands of a master screenwriter, Fences could have been perhaps a more visual, cinematic experience. Nonetheless, as stated before, the material is so fine and the acting so powerful, that Fences still remains up there in the pantheon of classic American cinema."

",0.0,0.7402,2018-07-28 00:00:00,6,"'Fences' is a reasonably good drama film that benefits from some excellent acting performances, especially from Denzel Washington as lead character Troy. It's a raw and realistic film that focuses heavily on character and story development and dialogue. Normally this would be good to see, but 'Fences' goes overboard and the excessive dialogue and running length works to the film's disadvantage.Many of the scenes of extended dialogue have little or no significance to the storyline and the film wouldn't have suffered if they had just been cut out altogether. The characters are also difficult to connect and sympathise with, especially Washington's character Troy, even though this is a character-driven drama. As a result it can be a struggle to stay interested for the full duration of the film, and I must admit that I found myself drifting off on more than one occasion."

" A filmed stage play distinguished by terrific performances
",0.6705,0.9397,2018-07-11 00:00:00,8,"Few movies make as little effort to disguise their stage origins as Fences. Director/Star Denzel seems to have no interest in turning Fences into a movie; he just wants to present the play on film. This is offputting at first, but as the movie proceeds the strength of its performances and the powerful words pull you in.Denzel plays a bitter, colorful guy so obsessed with the harm the world has done to him that he is blind to the harm he's done to others. It is an excellent, powerful performance; he is awful, yet you can see the charisma that keeps him from, at least at first, repelling the world.I had heard a lot about Viola Davis' award-winning performance, but her early scenes aren't all that impressive, perhaps because she doesn't have much to do. As the drama ramps up though, her performance becomes mesmerizing; a confrontation with Denzel is so searing one expects the film to melt.The rest of the cast is excellent, especially Mykelti Williamson as Gabriel.This sat in my queue for a long time, because I don't really have the interest in intense dramas I had in my younger days. But it is a deep and remarkably compelling drama well worth watching.Still, I feel a director more interested in making a movie than a filmed play would have been preferable."

Most of the time I read the reviews on here after watching the movie, and so did I with this movie, and that's only then that I realized that it used to be a play before becoming a movie. I'm not surprised because the movie is basically people talking whole the time. You never get a minute of rest, it's all about Denzel Washington ranting and raving about everything and nothing. It sometimes feels like a monologue with sporadic comments of the rest of the cast. Denzel Washington's character isn't the most pleasant man to listen to so at one point it gets a bit boring. As far as Viola Davis winning an Oscar for best performance by an actress in a supporting role I wouldn't go that far. Don't get me wrong she's a good actress but this movie is just not Oscar material, at least not to me. But then again over the years I saw alot of movies that in my eyes didn't deserve Oscars, so it might be me with my bad taste. All in all the movie is okay to watch once, but I will certainly not watch it a second time."

",0.7906,0.9918,2018-05-14 00:00:00,9,"Fences was better than I expected it to be. This is a truthful story about America in the 1950s, bringing across themes such as race and religion as truthfully as possible. Other themes such as a parent's love for their child, a child's hopes and dreams, as well as a couple's love, was brought about many times throughout the film and was delivered to great satisfaction. Denzel Washington was amazing as the lead of being Troy Maxson, creating a character that we hated and loved, loathed, yet sympathized, and brought about a truly life-sized and three dimensional character. His intensity stole every scene he was in and his words was delicate, yet tough and scary at times.Viola Davis, as Rose, brought about an emotional performance as the wife of Troy Maxson, and was done so well that I actually felt an emotional connection with her.There are emotionally high and low moments that succeeded. I wept and cheered, and was genuinely angry at some of the decisions the main character makes. Rarely does such a film make me so engrossed in their characters. Fences is truly one of the best films of 2017."
" Well acted, but rather dispiriting
",0.1406,0.9804,2018-05-14 00:00:00,7,"Troy is a middle-aged garbage collector in 1950s Pittsburgh. Though he gets some enjoyment from life, he is rather bitter about his past, and brings that along into his relationship with his teenage son Cory, with wife Rose doing her best to mediate between them. Life isn't wonderful, but it could get worse... The story in this film is set up in the trailer, but there is a development at the two-thirds point which comes as a surprise, and which drives developments up to the end of the film.Having said that, the plot is secondary: this film is primarily a character study. As the film progresses, we learn how Troy became the man he is: cognisant of his responsibilities as a family man, loving, bullying, kind, controlling, narrow-minded and long-sighted - in short, full of the contradictions which make every one of us a human being.Denzel Washington, directing and starring in the film version of the play which he and co-star Viola Davis played successfully on Broadway, controls this film both behind and in front of the camera. It is a brilliant performance. By the time this film is finished, you love this man and despise him at the same time, attitudes which are shared by his son Cory.But every member of the cast is exemplary. Viola Davis deserved her Oscar nomination, but I greatly like Mykelti Williamson, playing a part which is some distance from his usual range.My sole reservation is that the film is somewhat depressing: despite his positive notes, Troy isn't a very likeable man, and he carries a great deal of not very likeable baggage with him. But that is not the point of this story, it IS this story. And it's a story which is worth seeing for the performances alone."

",0.0,0.8246,2018-03-26 00:00:00,5,"This is the first review I have ever written on IMDB; and quite frankly I only felt the need to write it to express how poor this film is in general.There are some excellent pieces of acting that do need to be highlighted, Denzel Washington as always puts on a fantastic performance. Though with all the good of the performances there is no character progression (maybe that's the point to show the stagnation of the characters, but either way it wasn't entertaining). There is a lot of still scenes; one person talking to another. Again this may have been the idea to show the lack of progress the characters are making in life, and from a directors point of view if you were to analyse the film it would be quite interesting; but from an out and out entertainment point of view it made the film slow, boring and really ruined any chance of becoming engrossed in what you were watching."
" Fences faithfully adapts the Pulitzer-prize winning play but lacks cinematic edge.
",0.5859,0.6406,2018-03-23 00:00:00,7,"It's very difficult to manage expectations when the talent on and off screen is immeasurable. Washington acting and directing, Davis, Wilson's original drafted screenplay and loyally abiding to Wilson's last wishes by utilising an all African-American cast. For the most part, this drama succeeds. An old-school family's trust is broken when the husband admits to being unfaithful. What follows is an almost Shakespearean American drama that is fuelled by values and traditions. On paper, these characters are formidable forces. Proud individuals who hold the utmost respect for themselves, yet their lives are far from the idyllic dreams that they once had. The son has the same aspirations as the father, yet due to his failed ventures he refuses to let his son follow the same doomed path. Insinuating that racism played a fundamental role to his demise, he attempts to manipulate his son into thinking the same. It's a harsh family environment where the members are constantly treading carefully, fortunately Wilson's screenplay conveys the tension eloquently. The first act is a tidal wave of dialogue that allows Washington and Davis to establish their prominence. The latter being incredible, particularly during the snot-filled scene where she exclaims ""Well I've been standing here with you!"". Immediately I was stricken with goosebumps. Washington's directing style was simple as he ensures the screenplay is at the forefront. However, the major issue I have with this unabridged conversion of the play is that it has no cinematic style. It's as if I was watching the play, yet because Washington attempted to adapt this cinematically he consequently loses the theatrical intensity. Thus I struggled to remain compelled through certain scenes. So much dialogue and acting that it just doesn't settle, it lacked that emotional involvement. Fences is an incredibly intimidating film, wonderfully written and acted but occasionally disinteresting. I just wanted something more from this..."

" Fine Performances
",0.2023,0.9156,2018-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Based on the play by August Wilson: in 1950s Pittsburgh, the story centres on Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) and his family and friends. Troy is a troubled soul who believes life has given him a bad deal due to his race but his big breaks might have been missed due to other circumstances including his own misgivings. This causes a lot of family tension.The effect of the scenes in this film vary: some are quite moving and engaging while others are too long. Troy has a troubled relationship with his teenage son Cory (Jovan Adepo). At the film's beginning, this conflict plus Troy's inner conflict seem like promising material but during the film's long run, both of these conflicts seem to flatten and go nowhere despite the length of time they have to resolve themselves. Such criticisms might justify a maximum rating of two-and-a-half stars. But there are enough virtues in this film to raise the rating. These include the other scenes two of which stand out.The final scene is the perfect conclusion of all that has taken place before it. It's quite moving and leaves a lump in the throat. The film's greatest scene, however, takes place in the second half when Troy has a confrontation with his wife Rose (Viola Davis). Both of these experienced performers are at their peak and they play off each other superbly. If there were an award category for Best Scene in a Film, this one would certainly qualify as a nominee.In addition to Washington and Davis, there are also fine performances from Adepo and Mykelti Williamson who plays Troy's brother, a World War II veteran who was mentally damaged during the war."

" Davis and Washington deliver powerhouse performances in 'Fences'
",0.0,0.9366,2018-03-05 00:00:00,8,"August Wilson's storied play 'Fences' got the big screen treatment in 2016, thanks to the careful stewardship of Denzel Washington. Following a starring role in the play itself for 114 performances, Washington played double duty by directing and acting the film adaptation.If 'Fences' is nothing else, it is authentic. Set in 1950s Pittsburgh, the film follows the relationship a sanitation worker (Washington's Troy Maxson) and his family, namely his wife, Rose (Viola Davis), teenage son Cory (Jovan Adepo) and his special needs veteran brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson). Troy is a flawed man, and this becomes clear as the story unfolds. He is unnecessarily tough on Cory, who wants to follow in his footsteps as a talented athlete. He's a drunk. And he cheats on his wife.Still, Troy is seen as a sympathetic character. He does not understand the pain and frustration he causes. When he begrudgingly gives his older son Lyons $10, it's to teach him a lesson, but it also exposes the strained relationship between them. And then there's the fence. Not only the namesake of the movie, but a symbol of the barrier that is slowly being built between Troy and everyone around him.Of course, we're all here for the acting performances. Davis and Washington deliver what are among the best performances of their careers, a large part of this due to the incredible dialogue and the rawness that they bring to their characters.'Fences' is a deep, emotional film that paints a picture of a very specific time in our nation's history, and should be appreciated for its modesty and humility."

However, from the very beginning of this movie, Denzel Washington spewed the word *nigga* over a dozen times. It only went downhill from there. After 35 minutes into this pathetic movie and Denzel spewing *nigga* every other word got extremely tiring and most irritating to say the least. Very out of character for him imo . Then to see my grandson (who happens to be BLACK) watching this, forget trying to convince him this word is unacceptable ...... period! Very disappointed!!!"
" Viola Davis deserves every single Oscar from now until 2020.
",0.0,0.9678,2018-03-01 00:00:00,7,"This movie begins slowly, pacing its way through established character history and the complicated natures of human relationships. The lens with which Denzel has chosen to cast light on these characters takes time to ignite, but when it does? Watch out. This is exceptionally true in the case of Viola's depiction. Her character not only carries the weight of her husband's mistakes, her acting also carries the plot forward. Rose's strength is the foundation that keeps this family together. Her commitment to her family transcends the constraints of the complications between her and her husband. There are so many moments that I wish I could delve into, but this movie surprised me. It took a bit to get where it was going, and by the time I was ready to give in, it threw an emotional tidal wave at my feet as if saying, ""There. Are you happy now?""When it hits, it hurts. Someone get Viola Davis a million dollars."
" Not what I hoped
",-0.2924,0.9878,2018-02-28 00:00:00,6,"Fences sported a great cast and sounded like it could have been a great film. However this film fails badly when it comes to plot and story. While there are some interesting moments, backstory and development that goes on here there is an absence of a decent plot. Fences also never hits the ground running and one cannot quite figure out what the film is about. There is so much unnecessary dialogue that is supposed to be reflective of the lifestyle but this adds no value but time. For a two hour film cutting out the futile bickering and trading it for more depth and richer dialogue could have been better. The acting is very good. Denzel is superb as a monstrous character and Viola Davis is terrific in her role as well. The supporting cast do a great job. The rating for this largely comes from the superb acting and talent demonstrated. Its a shame it was for such a weak story and disappointing film. 6/10"
" Fences Locks you In and Holds You
",0.0,0.7317,2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Get ready for a roller coaster ride into deeply personal territory with 'Fences' as it pulls no punches with its strait talking assaults on the senses. Multi award winning playwright August Wilson digs deep into the soul of 50's black America as it comes to terms with life in the hard lane. He is no stranger to this hardship and you can feel the pain from his past and the people he writes about in every scene. This is Eugene O'Neill and James Agee territory and would have been right at home with the thoughtful production works of David Susskind (All The Way Home '63/East Side West Side series). The movie maybe an uneasy watch for those who don't enjoy movies based on stage productions but for those who enjoy in-depth character studies, this will offer some challenging and rewarding viewing. It's longish at around 130 mins so leave yourself a little more time to roll with it as it flows. Performances and photography are equally dynamic with an engaging music score to add the right amount of punctuation. Recommended for serious viewing."
" Stopped watching after 50 minutes! (no spoilers)
",-0.2942,0.8709,2018-02-12 00:00:00,4,"I honestly only watched this movie because it was on my Oscar 2017 highlights and it was the only movie I haven't watched from this list. Fences tells the story of the Maxson family and that's pretty much it. This movie is one of the most boring movie experiences I've ever watched and by far I guess the worst movie of 2016. The only three redeemable things about this movie are Viola Davis' and Denzel Washington's performances and some life lessons that Troy tells his children. The story of this movie is just about their life and that's it. I understand that it tried to be realistic but unlike Moonlight where that story was told in an interesting way that catched my attention and made me interested in what happened next, in this movie there is nothing interesting happening or something that might catch my attention and make me wanna watch the rest of the movie. It also tried to have bad-ass dialogue and be a dialogue-driven movie like Pulp Fiction but that movie was memorable for it's interesting storyline that had multiple stories intertwine by the end and more importantly for it's dialogue which was catchy either with it's constant language abuse or weird circumstances. Here there is nothing catchy or interesting or entertaining at all. The rest of things are just average like the score which had only 2 cues in the whole 50 minutes i watched or the cinematography which was average as was probably necessary in the movie.Boring movie with only 2 good performances and some life lessons, weak score, weak and uninteresting story that made me sleep after 26 minutes but on a rewatch the next day nothing improved and I decided to stop wasting my time with this movie at the 50 minutes mark. 4/10"

" Life is more than balls and strikes.
",-0.3612,0.7735,2018-01-16 00:00:00,8,"This is one of those don't miss flicks you hear about. Working as a trash collector in Pittsburgh in the late 1950's, Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) is profoundly bitter about his station in life. He possessed the talent and aptitude to be a professional baseball player, but his dreams were shattered knowing no contract would be coming due to his age and the fact that major league baseball started admitting black athletes too late for him to take his swings for the fences. A mundane job with little chance for advancement and earning just enough to sustain a modest home for his long-suffering wife, Rose (Viola Davis); Troy is a conflicted man. And there is the shambled relationship with his estranged 17-year old son, Cory (Jovan Adepo). Troy is head strong in blocking Cory's opportunity to play college football. Not that misery loves company, but anger is easy to bestow on the one that follows. Fair of not, Maxson is hard headed in his belief that fences fence some folks in and other folks out. Prejudice and regret remains in the forefront. Washington and Davis are at the top of their game. Both characters are heartfelt and composed of reality. Rounding out the cast: Stephen Henderson, Saniyya Sidney, Mykelti Williamson and Russell Hornsby."
" I'm not on the fence about this one. Boring.
",-0.3182,0.8619,2018-01-03 00:00:00,5,"I wouldn't recommend this film. There's just no plot at all, even though the acting is phenomenal. Call me odd, but I think there ought to be a moral or lesson to be learnt from films, and the only thing I learnt from Fences is that abysmal screenwriting can be rescued by exceptional actors. (Well, just about.) The first hour of the movie features a drunken Denzel Washington staggering around his house, talking. At first, I tried to figure out how his outbursts might be significant to the plot, but before long I realised that Troy just liked the sound of his own voice. Needless to say, I was bored. In between wanting to become a truck-driver, and selling furniture to Satan, Troy cheats on his wife and then things get a bit more interesting. Mostly because of Viola Davis' brilliant performance, but also because Troy dies and we don't have to deal with his monologue-ing anymore.Overall, it's noisy, talkative, and rather pointless. Go watch something else."

" An Acting and Script Clinic
",0.0,0.9493,2017-12-07 00:00:00,9,"(Flash Review)As great painters brush vivid colors onto canvas, Fences brushes meaningful and vibrant dialog onto film that paints a deep emotional story of a man trying to reconcile his station in life during the mid- 50s when African Americans were starting to make significant strides with their civil rights. One could argue that he builds mental fences for himself that slow him from adapting to a changing world as life scenarios with his kids, work and wife illustrate those points. Overall, the storytelling is excellent as dialog around family dynamics rather than action moves the story; fitting as this was adapted from the stage. Even though the film was very stationary, the cinematography was crisp with rich colors. But the acting stole the show. Every character was exemplary and evoked an array of emotions. Acting and script at its best!"

I think they forgot this is a movie and not a play. Overacting and some poor acting abounds. Get the feeling the director failed to reign in Denzel."
" A universal message
",0.0,0.9217,2017-11-14 00:00:00,10,"Fences, the late August Wilson play adaptation, is a movie with universal messages about life, love, family, parenting and black identity. It shows the hardship of life in a common Africanamerican family set in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and the margins of society. It carries a universal message about a disappointed father, who wants to protect his teenage son of life disappointments. Haunted by his inner demons, Troy Maxon fails to show real love, instead we see his harsh personality towards his son and his wife. Too many disappointments in the past have led him to shut off his emotions towards his family but still remaining human and adopting his extramarital child. The movie depicts a society put on the social margins, fighting everyday issues and marital problems but giving us a ray of hope about complex family relations and a young generation respecting their parents. The masterful performance of Denzel Washington and Academy awarded Viola Davis brought this universal play to the screen, giving the viewers a real movie gem and a show calling for their emotional responses and a deeper introspective in their own personal relationships."

" Back when Hank Aaron was a nobody...
",0.0,0.9956,2017-10-24 00:00:00,9,"When Denzel and Viola were on Broadway in the successful revival of this August Wilson play, I would walk by the Cort theater as the show let out, wishing that I was a part of that very racially mixed audience. I was lucky enough to snag a playbill, but snagging an affordable ticket was impossible. I've stood in the back of the Cort theater for shows for standing room only, but that wasn't possible for this smash hit. In my many years of theater going, I've gotten to see one August Wilson play, ""The Piano Lesson"", learning about how the characters in all those plays were somehow connected, and that helped strike an interest in me to see all the others.Through lengthy conversations, the characters played by Denzel Washington and Viola Davis brought to the forefront every aspect of their personalities. Washington doesn't get much sympathy as the typical hard headed man of the house, objecting to his younger son's determination to get a sports scholarship (as he was considered too old when black men were finally able to join the professional leagues) and always harassing the older adult son over financial issues. His showier role however is upstaged by the subtlety of Viola Davis who quietly tries to guide him away from his stubborn ways while keeping their home happy. It's her steel magnolia that remains the heart and soul, while old fashioned macho pride threatens to vanquish everything she's managed to achieve. She remains a gentle and dignified soul, even when Washington drops a huge bombshell on her.Thought provoking and human, this is quite theatrical, an aspect that modern audiences might have a difficult time adapting to. Davis, who won a leading actress Tony, won the supporting actress Oscar, and it's very apparent that she should have been considered leading. I've seen some fine actresses in my time of all races, and Davis ranks near the top of the greatest. She's like a storm brewing inside, one that doesn't want to move up to hurricane level but eventually finds she has no choice. Davis allows herself to look undignified in one harsh moment where the young son must rush in to defend their mother, something I can totally identify with, bringing up long suppressed memories. This shows several variations of the human soul, some ugly and yet very human, and one gorgeous and heroic. It's the fences between the different levels of humanity that drives the idea home that it takes a special kind of heart to tear down those fences for good."
" Mediocre Theory
",0.0,0.9212,2017-10-09 00:00:00,10,"This theory simply states, that anthropologically, humans gave succor to the familiar, for survival purposes. If they knew the animal from past encounters, it meant it had not eaten them; therefore it was not a threat and a familiar interloper. Humankind can also be seen on the sidelines (i.e., the cave) clapping, when threatening species are killed by other predators. Fast-forward to entertainment in the twenty-first century; and why the mediocre are pushed forward as exemplars of entertainment.It can be noted that Australian actors win many awards in the USA, but do they win any awards anywhere else, no!? This is a false reading, as American acting has a limited pool of participants, who are not nurtured but then rushed in front of the cameras for what is termed 'product'. So when an Australian wins an American acting award, it is not anything more than a nod to being little more than mediocre. It is the mediocre defeating the mediocre. Case in point, Denzel Washington's brilliant performance in Fences, as leading male actor, was not familiar, was not mediocre, was utterly brilliant, as was the movie; but he was supplanted by the lead from the movie Manchester by Sea, as this was more familiar territory, a black man can't beat a white boy when he is acting the white man blues, this is the familiarity of survival. So Denzel's appropriate Oscar goes begging but will come up again, when the acting agenda is more familiar.In the USA, unlike Australia, there are no acting schools linked to a government fee program, hence the actors in America come from a fraternity of professionally focused individuals, the attrition levels must be incredible, but the actors who do make it to stardom, are then fully-supported in a 'star-system'. In Australia, it is more of an elite group, who are professionally trained but on the whim of perceived talents. Reading some of the other reviews for Fences reminds me of the Charles Bukowski line: 'They hate a man with a vocabulary'. Some here object to the fact that, the script is wall-to-wall text. Well for some of us that is all that matters, as one gun in a script is one gun too many, as the gun is meant to solve all script problems, beginnings, middles and endings – when in doubt shoot someone.Fences to me, as a scribbler, is 10/10, and when I see a movie rated thus I wouldn't see it, I generally become interested in a movie if it is rated 1/10 from the critics, as I have molded my tastes differently."

He can hold attention of the audience to an unimaginable level. Viola delivered a performance that overshadowed all her amazing performances that I've seen before. She is one of the best ever and she showed it here again. The supporting actors were not far from their leading comrades.

They stay there and don't allow for any gears to change. The setting is striped down which accentuates its play origins. A few tonal changes would help build the drama.

If the guy had a heart of gold or a modicum of concern for people, I may have gotten into this. I realize that Denzel Washington plays a character that has come up in the school of hard knocks and facing the evils of racism. But not only is he defeated, he openly tries to defeat everyone else in the film. Viola Davis is his long suffering wife. He's a guy that was a really good baseball player before the color barrier was broken. Maybe a star. But the times kept him from ever going anywhere. His brother is a war veteran who has suffered brain damage. He has a normal son with great athletic ability. His father betrays him when he is going to meet with recruiters which would lead to a college education. The movie looks like a stage production and Denzel delivers long speeches that he determines tell what the world is. In his eyes, it's not worth the effort. Disappointing after all the attention."
" Emotional Drama! 6/10
",0.2244,0.9854,2017-09-16 00:00:00,6,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, mainly because of the excellent performances from Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, but you can definitely tell that it was written for the stage, because it's based on dialogue and emotions more than actions. Denzel plays Troy Maxton, who is a ex-baseball player working as a garbage man. He's a loving husband, married to Rose (Viola Davis), with 2 sons, and he works hard to provide for his family but his strict views and damaging upbringing, takes a toll in his everyday life. His son Cory (Jovan Adepo) finds it hard to understand his father's views, so his mother keeps the peace between the both of them. After a traumatic event, which puts a strain on Troy and Roses relationship, Troy's demons start haunting him and the family home isn't a happy place to be. Regardless of his behaviour, Rose doesn't allow anyone to bad mouth Troy, because she knows that he lived his life for his family, even though he didn't know how to show it. It's definitely an emotional movie which is very well written and full of drama but from a cinematic point of view, it is very one toned. You have to be in the right mood to watch it, and it's not the type of movie that you will watch over and over again but with that aside, the performances are top class and I really couldn't see anyone else playing the leading roles. I would have liked to have seen what happened to Troy, because the movie skips towards the end but it's a decent watch which will definitely touch the audience hearts. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This is the 3rd movie directed by Denzel Washington, 62, who also directed Antwone Fisher and the Great Debaters in 2007. As he starred in the play alongside Viola Davis, who won the Oscar for Supporting Role, he was the best person to direct this emotional drama. It met all of my expectations, after reading the reviews and seeing various clips, so I wasn't surprised with the outcome, especially as it was based on the play by August Wilson, who sadly died in 2005. Budget: $24million Worldwide Gross: $65millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramas, starring Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Stephen Henderson, Jovan Adepo, Russell Hornsby and Mykelti Williamson. 6/10"

" Wrong side of the Fence
",-0.4767,0.9923,2017-09-04 00:00:00,5,"Sat through two hours and nineteen minutes of ""Fences"" tonight. Such a shame it took over an hour of celluloid running before the movie even started. We were so close to turning this off, and then there was the scene where Troy (Denzel Washington) revealed to Rose (Viola Davis) that he was about to become a father to another woman. That was 70 minutes in. And that was the precise moment this movie really began. Up until that moment we found this pointless and hard going. We understand that they wanted to show the character of these people. But that could have been done in 20 minutes. For far too long we sat through a self-indulgent working-class whinge-fest that went nowhere. At an hour in, we were just about to turn this off as we didn't care about any of the characters and whether they lived, died, or simply disappeared. And then we had real character drama. We had real conflict. We had purpose and direction as to where this was going. And this is where the characters became real, and the acting shone. Shame it took an hour to get to this point. Viola Davis truly deserved her Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. A powerhouse performance by her. But prior to this was just a bunch of people miserable about their lives. I expect the reason this falls down as a movie is that it is taken straight from the stage and filmed with only two sets . . . the kitchen and the backyard. There was no real adaptation for the screen, and this let the movie down. It was a stage-bound production that didn't fly as I was expecting it to. It may have been a great play on the stage, but a bit of a flop as a movie. And it doesn't have to be like this. Some great plays have been transformed into excellent movies. A prime example is ""'night, mother"" with Sissie Spacek and Anne Bancroft. This two-hander play is also filmed essentially with a single set comprising kitchen and lounge-room. But WOW! the filmed version never disappoints. I guess it depends on the material, the actors, and great direction. But somehow, it didn't translate for ""Fences"". We were sorely left wanting. Denzel's character had no growth or development. He remained the most self-centred, indulgent, and egocentric character I think I have seen for a long time. And that made it very hard to like him at all. The other characters seemed to soften and develop understanding and compassion to a degree, but not him. I was actually glad when he died and the others could have a life and gain some respite from his selfish tirades. And the realistic dialogue did not help . . . very fast speech and with extremely heavy period accents and intonation. . . along with lots of shouting. This made large chunks of this dialogue-driven film worthless. Large pieces of monologue were lost to unintelligible speech; but in the end, most of this was ranting by Troy about his lot in life, so likely we didn't miss that much. This film could have been vastly improved by trimming 50 or 60 minutes from the beginning. Have just a little discontent character background to begin with, but then launch into the drama of the illegitimate child and the impact of this upon the family. That would have made this far more palatable and tolerable. With trimming I might elevate this to a 7.5 from 10. But as it stands, at 139 minutes (but feels like 300), I give it 5 out of 10."
" Unwatchable, a waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.6808,2017-08-17 00:00:00,2,"We watched about 10 minutes of this, trying to give it a chance. It wasn't going anywhere and was just boring. Fastforwarded...Same crap, same slow pace. Boring, unintelligeble dialogue, no character development, no plot, nothing to hold your interest. Why this movie is rated above 4 or 5 stars is a mystery."
" A Devastating Social Drama about Race and Racism
",-0.8555,0.8542,2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Denzel Washington's devastating social commentary about growing up black in America during the 1940s and the 1950s in the movie ""Fences,"" based on August Wilson's award-winning Broadway play, is undeniably powerful stuff. Nevertheless, at the same time, the tragic saga about an embittered, blue-collar, Pittsburgh garbage collector searching for a better life is grueling from the get-go and doesn't let up until well over two hours have elapsed. Forget about any comic relief because there is none. It should be noted that Washington appeared in the 2010 revival of Wilson's play on Broadway, where it won several awards, but the cumulative effect of this drama is to leave you depressed. ""Fences"" channels the same sense of hopelessness as the memorable Arthur Miller play ""Death of a Salesman."" Mind you, Washington, who produced, directed, and rewrote parts of Wilson's play without credit, delivers a tour-de-force effort in each department, and the Oscar winning actor doesn't balk at showing the unsavory side of his lead character. There is nothing charming about the poor soul that he plays who is his own worst enemy. The theme of fathers and sons that runs through this awesome journey about an Alabama sharecropper who left Alabama after he had a fight with his abusive father and then fled north to find no better prospects is as insightful as it is disturbing. Washington displays unusual courage at showing warts and all in his character. He treats his own flesh with the same contempt and cunning that he handled his own father. Worse than this is his treatment of his steadfast, loving wife, played with dignity by Viola Davis, who took home a justly deserved Oscar. This is one of those movies with an ensemble cast, with Stephen Henderson and Mykelti Williamson shining in supporting roles as Washington's best friend and his war-wounded brother. As Troy Maxson, Washington laments the lack of opportunity that not only he suffered in American society but also the setbacks that African-Americans endured as they were breaking the color barrier during the racist post-World War II years. Wilson's material is so robust that Washington as a director doesn't have to concern himself with exterior peripheral details that show up in the form of anachronisms that filmmakers usually trip over when they plunge into the past to gain perspective on the future. Suffice to say, ""Fences"" is not the kind of movie that you watch to relieve your troubles after a long day. Unlike fantasy-based Hollywood movies that strive to eliminate every shred of reality from their narrative so audiences will emerge feeling better about themselves, ""Fences"" dares to be different with gusto. Washington's character will one that you will like initially until he peels back the layers of his breadwinner to show somebody that you'd never want to have anything to do with. You would cross the street so you wouldn't have to walk never him. The abuse with which he treats one son who merely wants a loan of ten dollars will leave you questioning your like for this charismatic actor. Nothing about ""Fences"" is lightweight. This is a heavyweight drama, and Washington proves that he is a consummate actor as well as a director to achieve this unforgettable, slice-of-life drama."
" Born with two strikes
",-0.3612,-0.9586,2017-08-13 00:00:00,8,"The film takes place 1956-1957 in Pittsburgh. Troy (Denzel Washington) works as a garbage man. He harbors a certain bitterness of life. He is a black man in a white man's world, not seeing the changes since 1918. He was a successful ballplayer in the Negro Leagues, but was too old to play when the leagues were integrated. He likes to tell stories and has ""more stories than the devil has sinners"" and the stories grow with each re-telling. He has a wife Rose (Viola Davis) and a son Cory (Jovan Adepo) who lives in fear of his stern father.The movie is a long drama which doesn't have any real conflict until 75 minutes into the feature. We get to learn about Troy and take that walk in his shoes. In spite of all of his faults and failings, Troy believes in responsibility, perhaps more than love.It is an interesting look at life at that time when American race culture was making a slow change. This is far from an action film and may be too slow for those who don't want to see an emotional drama. Well acted.Guide: N-word. Sex talk. No swearing, sex, or nudity."

" Well Acted, should have stayed a Play!
",0.5848,0.9924,2017-08-02 00:00:00,5,"This movie was very hard to sit through. It was so hyped up. I thought I was going to be watching another Training day or another amazing Denzel Movie. Fact is, it SUCKED! I hated it ad so did every person I know who has seen it.This film is suppose to be a Broadway play and a Broadway play it should have stayed! This script has no business being a feature film. The acting was great. Im not taking anything away from Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, but it just seemed like a Broadway play on screen. That's all. It feels like this was just an opportunity for 2 amazing actors to show off their acting ability. Somewhat like Daniel Day Lewis did in ""There will be blood"", but the fundamental difference between ""Fences"" and ""There will be blood"", is THE SCRIPT! Fences is so inferior to the There will be blood. And as good as Denzel is at acting, Daniel Day Lewis is probably THE greatest of all time, Yes, even better than the legends.Bottom line is this. I feel it was incredibly over-hyped because of all the race-related drama going on in the world. The Black Lives Matter movement, and the ""Oscars so white"" controversy. It feels like they just HAD to put two amazing actors together and nominate them for the big awards. But it sucked man. It really did. Anyone who says different is either lying to you, or to themselves.6/10 stars"
" An amazing play makes for a very good film.
",0.8553,0.9946,2017-07-30 00:00:00,8,"A very good and heart-wrenching movie, but it stays a bit too close to its roots as a play. Everyone involved delivers a gripping performance. Denzel Washington and Viola Davis are both amazing; all the supporting cast are wonderful too but I'd specifically praise Stephen Henderson (Bono) and Jovan Adepo (Cory). The movie is small and tight and focused; I can respect that choice, but it comes at a cost. We spend probably less than five minutes anywhere outside the Maxson home, and every one of those scenes feels like a welcome view into the larger world that Troy inhabits. Exploring this world would flesh out Troy's life and ground the choices he makes. Maybe that wouldn't work out well -- it would require stepping away from August Wilson's excellent play and creating new material. With Wilson no longer alive, it would be a serious risk, and so the safer choice is essentially a filmed staging of the play. Rating this movie with 8/10 stars is a bit unfair, as it's filled with wonderful performances. But it suffers from being so near to greatness without quite making the jump."
" Requires patience and endurance, unquestionably an actor's picture
",0.0,0.9874,2017-07-20 00:00:00,5,"Eighty minutes of non-stop talk (mostly by Denzel Washington's character) followed by 20 minutes of reflection (again), then some difficult emotional moments topped with a sprinkling of light.In other words, it's not an easy movie to watch, and many won't stay with it for all the blather - personal 'philosophy' - spouted by Troy Maxson (Washington), who's lived a hard life which he's obviously thought a lot about as he's ready to share it continuously whether anyone wants to hear it (again) or not. He does provide for his family, though oftentimes it appears resentfully, and does exhibit some grace in the caring for his disabled brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson, Bubba in Forrest Gump (1994)), though even that comes from a sense of obligation.Viola Davis plays Rose, a wife who's a blessing to him beyond his due. She has sacrificed herself for Troy, as she cleans up the debris of his harsh parenting of their sons and even his act of betrayal. Fortunately for Troy, Rose has a Christian faith from which she draws her strength, as she selflessly serves the family. Ms. Davis was brilliant and won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar while playing what is essentially a leading role in this film; she likely would not have beaten Emma Stone (La La Land (2016)) in that category.Not too much to recommend unless you like listening to people talk, or actors' act; if you watch movies to be entertained - or uplifted - stay away. There's little hope here."

" Wow!
",0.6239,0.9958,2017-07-07 00:00:00,9,"First of all, I must say that when I was already at my seat, I didn't actually knew what I was going to see. I mean, I had already seen the trailer and read the synopsis which basically says that the movie talks about the family struggles of an African-American man at the late 50's, and that's all.And this movie was also the must unexplored film of the Oscars for me because literally there was no cinema in the entire city that was projecting it and actually the only one nominated to the Oscars which seemed that all the theaters ignored.But then one day (last week) I was checking the listings of a theater that only plays art films and cult classics and I suddenly saw that this movie theater was projecting Fences. I immediately told my mother who also wanted to see it long time ago.Anyway, we finally could see this movie today and I must say that at first I wasn't understanding and easily missing quite a bit of what was going on because there were lots of dialogues which were said too fast, but then when I started understanding the story, I was more shocked every time, as for the truly unexpected situations, so for the performances (which were more stunning every minute) of Mr. Washington and Mrs. Davis. They were so great and real.I also enjoyed to see again Mykelti Williamson (who also did a great job), because I hadn't seen him acting again since Forrest Gump.In conclusion, this is a great movie that I highly recommend especially for the performances and the twists of the story. I think Denzel Washington did a great job of direction and performance. I'm certainly glad that Viola Davis got her Oscar, but I think this film was worthy of many more, including Best Actor (I still don't get what the Academy saw on the terrible and empty ""performance"" of Casey Affleck).Standing ovation for Mr. Washington!"

" Denzel Washington and Viola Davis are the powerhouse of this riveting Broadway play-based drama
",0.0,0.9977,2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Featuring an all-black cast, Fences is a deeply riveting domestic drama that celebrates the talent of Denzel Washington in both the acting and directorial department. Sitting in the director's chair for the first time in over a decade, Washington makes a diligent effort both in front and behind the camera to bring August Wilson's Broadway play of the same time to life on the silver screen. His efforts not only embrace the beauty of Wilson's spectacular theatrical project but effectively shed a bright life on the foibles of the African-American culture during the pre-Civil Rights era when segregation between whites and blacks defined American society. It's only too bad that Wilson who wrote the script here passed away a little over a decade prior to this production. The basis of this historical drama is a story that trims away from action in favor of a dialogue-driven narrative, an effort that focuses on the study of one man struggling to make sense of life in a world where the African-American community were victim of shallow opportunities. Set in the 1950s, this film stars Denzel Washington as Troy Maxson, a black garbageman raising his family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His family includes his stay-at-home wife Rose (played by Viola Davis), his impaired war veteran brother Gabriel (played by Mykelti Williamson), and his teenage son Cory (played by Javon Adepo) who's set to play college football. When Cory is given the opportunity, his hard-nosed father brushes it off as of result of his disillusionment for not being able to play Major League Baseball at the right age before blacks were being accepted in the league. The tensions between him, Cory, and Rose soon become more heated when they learn some dark secrets about his past.""Some fences are built to keep people out, others are built to themselves in"", a quote by Denzel Washington's character that signifies the premise of his historically resonated drama. This play-based film operates with the story that cradles the history of the troubled race relations that confined many families in the black community in a cage lacking of life opportunities and short of social prosperity. The focus here is not on based on a true story but instead a character study of a man with intense complexity that greatly unravels throughout the story's proceeding. Denzel Washington adopts the role of Troy Maxson who dreams of his family, especially his son, to succeed in life but his deeply perplexing personality not only places a strain on his family, but leaves audiences to discover he is definitely not a great man as he seems. While he evolves into a somewhat unlikable figure, he nonetheless grows into an interesting character. He's plagued with many flaws that define him as a character, and when a secret of his past finally meets the ears of his beloved wife, things take a turn for the worse. The scene in which this happens marks one of the film's most emotional landmarks. Denzel Washington and Viola in particular, are the revelation of the film's emotional crux. The subtle, yet cutthroat dialogue delivered by Washington quickly grabs your attention each scene after another, and the emotionally-charged delivery by Davis is gut-wrenching. The emotional chemistry between the two and his son is powerful enough to the point where it is easy to forget you are watching a movie adapted from a play. Washington's direction certainly ignites the feel of an onstage play, but his execution of the domestic tension in each scene wrings a high-strung sense of authenticity from start to finish. Unlike some cinematic entities where the action is firmly confined to talking, this film succeeds on operating with snappy dialogue without feeling the need ignite an action set piece to lasso one's attention. Fences is a powerfully rewarding play-based drama helmed by the wildly appealing directorial and acting talent by Denzel Washington, as well as Viola Davis in her powerhouse performance. The movie may feel like a play, especially as it is edited like a play. But does that make it any less powerful? Absolutely not. Washington shines with incredible talent, a talent that more than deserves widespread attention."
" Trying to be a good husband and father!
",0.4926,0.9898,2017-06-14 00:00:00,7,"It took nearly a decade for Denzel to direct another film and this time it sailed through the Oscars with four nominations and one won out of it. Yeah, it was Viola Davis, who snatched the most prestigious award for her supporting actress role. Originally the film based on the stage play of the same name. It is a drama takes place in the 50s about a hard working family man, Troy. His past was not very good, which makes him a little arrogant when it comes to raining his boy. Marrying Rose was the best ever thing happened in his life. Though it was not a perfect family. The differences between them is what later bring twist and turns in the tale before heading for the final of the final act.A very simple drama on the fine topic. Most of the film was just a conversation or arguments. And most of the film was little slow moving with the very long overall runtime. If you can manage that, you can enjoy it. If you are a drama genre fan, then you will be more than happy for giving it a try. One of the best drama films of the year, yet not the greatest. It's all finger points at the performances. Those magnificent actors displayed magnificent show. Nearly 35 years old screenplay and 70 years old timeline, still looked the same and powerful. Despite the film's success and poured praises, I don't think it is for everyone. Definitely young generations won't enjoy it. It is mainly for families.6/10"
" Superior Acting Skills on Display
",0.5423,0.9943,2017-06-11 00:00:00,10,"""Fences"" (2016) I readily admit that I am an ""acting addict"". In other words, I greatly admire the craft of acting when it is responsible for making a good film into a great film. ""Fences"" is an example of this.Based on the play by August Wilson and directed by Denzell Washington, ""Fences"" will never appeal to those of us who relish those action-packed, comic book spectacles that dominate the industry now. That said, ""Fences"" was shot as a play: intricate scenes, minimal locations, emphasis on words and acting. Never boring, frequently riveting, it presents itself as a venue for all thought-provoking matters of the heart, as well as the nuances of growing up black in the urban setting of Pittsburg in the 1950's.So as not to ruin the experience, I won't get into specifics, but I will say that this film cemented my opinion that Viola Davis is one the finest actors of our time and earned the best actress Oscar, easily beating a quartet of wonderful nominees. Her performance was chilling; this is what her craft is all about. ""Fences"" was also nominated for the best picture award.With Denzell Washington at the helm, the film really delivered August Wilson's messages. I am miffed that Denzell was not nominated for the best director award. But, Mr. Washington's acting chops were on full display here and he delivered another notch in his belt of many superlative roles. Denzell rightfully earned a best actor Oscar nomination last year for ""Fences"".The cast was rounded out by Russell Hornsby (Grimm, Suits), Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump, CSI: NY, Justified), Stephen Henderson (Manchester-By-The-Sea, Lincoln) and Jovan Adepo (The Leftovers, NCIS: Los Angeles) - all wonderful.My only complaint, a minor one, is the length of the movie; at 2 hours, 19 minutes, it does tend to drag a in the middle of the film. Rated PG-13 for language. Appropriate for teens; in fact, a great discussion film for parents and their older kids. There's a lot going on here that teens and all of us adults could learn from.Available on DVD and Blue ray. Should be on-demand from Netflix, cable companies and on premium channels, soon."
" On the Fence about Fences
",0.0,0.5548,2017-06-09 00:00:00,5,"Fences earned Oscar nominations and Viola Davis won Best Actress as Rose, so expectations were high. Unfortunately, Fences disappoints.The story had next to no intrigue. Denzel as Troy is a disgruntled working class man in the 1950s who is just getting by. He's got a big personality with opinions on everything. And he talks, constantly, to the point of being annoying. The film slowly reveals the challenges he's had in his life, and most recently, due to his skin color. He overused the N-word to the point of exhaustion. He dominates the film, the story, and the house.Their modest typical 1950s house stacked next to all the other city houses was the centerpiece of practically all activity. He was fenced in in many ways. This cinematography was pretty clever. There were next to no beautiful landscape shots or anything attractive, which furthered the plainness of survival-level living.Fences circles back to this fence that Troy has been working on for years for his wife Rose. I guess it is an analogy for their relationship, always working on it, looks good on the outside, but it just isn't. And it's slow work, involving a lot of back and forth.Troy's wife Rose is a hard character to watch. Her job is to take care of the house and the kids and manage the money. She has no pleasures in life other than taking care of everyone except herself. She endures many hardships brought on by Troy. She is tough but in many ways weak. She fails to stand up to Troy's abusive lifestyle, ever, taking more and more crap from him.As the movie plods along, Troy disrespects everyone - wife, kids, friends. You get to a key point of the movie, and again he just dumps. He acts like he's not responsible for his own stupid decisions and that everyone needs to accept him because he makes money.Many times I screamed at Rose to do or say something strong, take a stand. The only one with backbone is their youngest child Cory, who develops over time into a child anyone would be proud of. Except Troy, who I think is jealous of Cory. I got very tired watching Fences due to the length and repetition of events. There are many dialogues where it feels like the director is having the character preach to the audience like in Blazing Saddles. Troy's behavior exhausted me like that part by Decaprio in Wolf of Wall Street. Self absorbed behavior that could have really been expressed by the Director in a lot less scenes would have helped.In the end, the story has very little twists and turns. There is no excitement, no Hollywood ending. People's behaviors infuriated me by actions or lack of reactions. The ending was poor by trying to get the audience to feel sympathy when none was really due. Fences featured terrific acting by Viola Davis and the actor who played Bono, Denzel's friend. But Denzel was way over the top, so again, either the story or the Director needed to reign this in.Disappointing film, sorry to say."
" Really Lame
",-0.4754,-0.9861,2017-06-05 00:00:00,2,"This movie is very slow moving, boring, nearly pointless, and is painfully low budget with the exception of Denzel Washington's fees. From start to finish we just kept waiting for a story to unravel, but it's like nothing happens. 99% of the scenes take place at their run down house, and most of the time Denzel Washington acts like a bitter racist jerk, he dies, and then it ends. There's just not enough content to justify a movie here. What content there was is on the depressing and disturbing side. Not much of interest takes place, nothing uplifting or inspirational, it's not complex, or entertaining to follow. It just plods along, then ends. It was reasonably well acted, but there's just not enough substance to go around. The leading lady did a fine job with what she was given, but isn't attractive enough to add appeal given the lack of content. It's a boring, slow, uninteresting movie that I felt was pretty much a waste of two hours."

Just pop this baby into your DVD player and you'll be in nod nod land in no time. If this film is worthy of an award then it should be for curing sleep deprivation. This film proves that even with an amazing cast of talented actors, acting their behinds off, you need some sort of semblance of a plot. Whoever wrote this, clearly just recorded a few conversations over the garden fence that his drunk neighbour was having in his garden and thought 'Yep, that'll do' When my baby son is older, I will use this film as a punishment for when he's naughty. I won't be grounding him or taking away pocket money, I will make him sit and watch Fences. I can guarantee after being punished once by me with this, he will never be naughty again."

You've got a black guy in the 50's who is angry he never got to play major league baseball(Denzel) - even though he was a career robber and murderer. He's got a brain damaged brother who didn't get enough benefits after head trauma in WWII. A housewife who's nose gushes snot like a fire hydrant when she cries(Viola). And a high school age son who is being recruited by colleges due to his football prowess. By the end of this Sanford and Son episode the self centered liar Denzel has 3 kids with 3 different women, and he keeps his son from going to college. Add a bunch of drinking, a little child abuse, and the n-word about 45,00 times and you've got the perfect movie for ""affirmative action academy awards year"". Pathetic."

But there were too many other problems with it, starting with poor editing, stilted dialogue and a surprisingly unconvincing performance by Denzel Washington. Since Mr. Washington was the main character, that of course led to a problematic result. I can't say I would not recommend this film, and perhaps it should be viewed for Ms. Davis's performance. But on the whole this was unfortunately rather mediocre."

In the beginning, it can be hard to keep up with the dialogue, but eventually it becomes easier to understand. The performances are superb. Denzel Washington is terrific, making his character sometimes difficult to like, but entirely human throughout. Viola Davis is also astonishing (it's no wonder she won an Oscar), and Washington's direction is also commendable. As I mentioned, some may find it too talk-heavy, but it's still well-worth viewing for the strength of its performances and emotional resonance. 8/10."
" Ironically, it's garbage.
",0.0,0.8564,2017-05-22 00:00:00,1,"While I love Denzel's acting in other movies, this movie made him seem like a brand new actor looking for any role he can get his hands on. Viola is one of my most hated actresses to begin with, but I did not consider that bias in my opinion of the movie. Williamson (who played Gabriel) was the best actor of them all, giving a heartwarming, bittersweet image to his character. The other actors were mediocre.The plot of the movie was... well, nonexistent, at least for the majority of the film. Due to torturous boredom, I could not withstand the entire film and had to turn it off about 80% through it. Later, I read about the rest of the plot and, to no surprise, found out that it takes an eternity for a little action to occur. Most of the movie is Denzel as some garbageman yammering on in some slang-infested monologue. I'd say about 50% of the movie is his analogies, exaggerated stories and delusions that make absolutely no sense and contribute nothing to the movie. The screenplay seems untouched from the play which makes the movie unbearable. I was, in essence, watching nonstop metaphors in an unintelligible Ebonics dialect. I am not exaggerating when I say that I could not understand a good chunk of what Denzel was saying.To finish this off, I warn potential viewers to not appeal to authority, because that is a logical fallacy. When just under 6,000 white, older male elites determine what is worthy of an Academy Award (probably based on how much they've been bribed), it is not an inherent indicator that the movies they've chosen are actually good. Beware of the Academy and their attempts to make you watch horrible movies."
" A film about nothing

Watch it do not recommend, despite the fact that she won so many awards and nominated for an Oscar. There was a time when she was relevant and a good play, but it is in the past. Therefore will briefly describe the plot, so you do not waste time. 50 years in America, racism is still alive, when the black is allowed to be a garbage man, but not the driver of the garbage truck. The story tells about the life of Troy, a black man over forty, who is barely making ends meet to feed his family consisting of his wife and son. Yet Troy has a son from a previous marriage, who sometimes visited by the father with the intent to ask for money. Troy is unhappy with her sons, constantly teaches their lives, for good or bad. In my opinion, he is a bad father. He has no emotional warmth and love to their children. Troy from the category of people that think: if I conceived my son, I already gave him a lot. But if I still and contained, then I the Holy Martyr. In the end, he gets the response ratio of children to himself. This asshole instead of having to take care of his family and buy a home the television, gets a mistress, explaining that he saw this as another chance in life. The Troy family is falling apart, the wife was very hurt, son despises. And what Troy was waiting for? Applause? The mistress dies in childbirth, leaving Troy's daughter. Troy never shows his feelings, keeping it to himself. But what's inside it can't be called good, it's more like constant anger and resentment. In the end, the newborn daughter he hangs on the shoulders of his wife. His wife is the most positive image of this picture. Why the fence? Troy very long built for his wife the fence near the house and eventually built it. One sees that the fence symbolizes protection from death Troy. She didn't protect, because at the end of the film Troy died. One sees that the fence symbolizes the removal of Troy from his son and wife. Someone ViDi, this fence symbolizes that Troy's wife is able to protect from the ills of life for his family. I think all these versions are nonsense."
" Wonderful, engaging story, with superb performances
",0.8807,0.9977,2017-05-13 00:00:00,9,"Pittsburgh, mid-1950s. Troy Maxson is a sanitation worker, working a shift with his best friend Jim Bono. Troy has been happily married to Rose for 18 years and they have a teenage son, Cory. Regularly popping in and out of their lives is Gabe, Troy's brother who suffered brain damage while fighting the Japanese in WW2, and Lyons, Troy's 34-year old son from a previous relationship. Troy was a baseball star in the late-1930s, playing in the Negro League, and still bears a grudge for his not being able to play Major League Baseball. He projects this, and other experiences, onto everyone around him, particularly Cory, who has the potential to be a football star. More than just influencing Cory's career prospects (adversely, it appears), Troy has a larger-than- life impact on the lives of everyone around him.Wonderful, engaging film, directed by Denzel Washington. A character-driven drama with great depth, and some incredibly profound and emotional moments. Plot takes on several themes but in the end you are left with a great sense of family and how parents shape the lives of their children.Excellent performances all round. I can't think of a recent movie where I've seen so many outstanding performances in one film. Denzel Washington is great as Troy, dominating the screen and the dialogue. He's in just about every scene and probably ends up with more than 60% of the dialogue in the movie. However, despite Denzel Washington's larger-than-life presence, he is pipped in the performance stakes by Viola Davis. While Troy's character is pretty direct and uncomplicated, Rose's is much more nuanced, complex and evolving, and Viola Davis is brilliant as her. A powerful yet subtle performance and good enough to get Davis the 2017 Best Supporting Actress Oscar.Supporting cast are great too. The standout for me was Mykelti Williamson as the mentally-challenged Gabe. A difficult role, and one that can easily be botched, but Williamson does it very well, with a sensitive, convincing performance.Brilliant, and certainly better than Moonlight. It should have been a contest between Fences and La La Land for the 2017 Best Picture Oscar."

" fences can keep people out or in
",0.0,0.9643,2017-04-16 00:00:00,10,"August Wilson was a renowned playwright whose works focused on the experiences of the African-American community throughout the twentieth century. His 1985 play ""Fences"" is about a garbage collector in 1950s Pittsburgh who struggles to cope with the changing world around him. Wilson wrote a screenplay but died before it got made into a movie. Well, Denzel Washington has brought ""Fences"" to the big screen.In addition to directing, Washington plays the main character, Troy. Troy is a working stiff who always has something to say. On the one hand, he tries to keep his marriage together, but he can't escape his past. Troy's wife Rose (Viola Davis) never misses a chance to have her say, especially when it comes to the future of their son.An important line is ""fences can keep people in or out"". The fence getting erected outside the house is an allegory for the emotional barrier that Troy has built between himself and his sons. Similarly, the fence reflects Rose's desire to keep the current family together.All in all, it's a fine piece of work. While mainly addressing the plight of African-Americans in the 1950s, the story could apply to just about any ethnic group. Viola Davis definitely deserved her Oscar for the role (she and Denzel Washington previously won Tonys for a stage production). Everyone should see it.Also starring Stephen Henderson, Russell Hornsby (Hank on ""Grimm"") and Mykelti Williamson (Bubba in ""Forrest Gump"")."

Acting is superb and it was interesting to see Troy Maxson make one of the regrettable choices that his father also made.

",-0.5574,0.9933,2017-04-10 00:00:00,8,"Fences is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It adapts a play in to film very effectively, staying true to its source material. The movie captures a man as he experiences somewhat of a midlife crisis when his children go off to pursue their dreams, something he feels he never had the chance to do. Normally we see it from the person pursuing the dream's point of view, and the parent that is not supporting them is somewhat of an antagonist, however, here we see it from their perspective, which creates a significantly different story. I did feel that it was a bit too like a play at some points, there are long sequences where the characters merely speak and it all has nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. It clearly was not altered much from the theatre script, it could have changed some scenes to make them more film-esque, as their were far too many moments where I felt I could have just watched it on stage. The cast is phenomenal, Denzel Washington hits it out of the park with this one, portraying a damaged man with alcoholism. He develops his character's state very realistically throughout. Viola Davis also shines as Washington's wife and received a well deserved Academy Award for her passionate, daring and raw performance that is transcending every moment she is on screen. It was an Oscar contender for a reason, be sure not to miss it. Powerful, intense performances and an engrossing plot, Fences is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama. A down on his luck father begins to spiral out of control as his children leave home. Best Performance: Denzel Washington"

This man thinks that he is a realist and he is the best and perfect. He thinks that he knows everything and whatever he knows and does is the best right thing to be done. But...! this comes out later that he is wrong, he is no good like he thinks he is. He made mistakes in the past which wasn't good at all. He again making mistakes doing wrong things thinking that they are the right things. He totally messed up the lives of his family; his wife, his kids and then the guy dies leaving his family behind with nothing so good to live with. It is a totally messed up story of a very complicated man and his family, there is no good in it. Okay, if we see from the perspective of what we can learn from it is just the one thing that don't think that you are the best and the perfect one and knows everything. Put your ego aside and let others lead a life they want to live. Don't put them with restrictions and limitations according to what your mind can think is the right thing to be done. It is a real Fd up story no one ever needed to watch and waste their time upon. Yes, if u have got real plenty of free time, you can go for it, but it is no good, there is no good in it and nothing to learn as well. Just waste."

She was great and Denzel SHOULD have won not Casey Affleck for this film because his performance was moving, touching and brilliant.The film I will admit is a bit slow because it's basically Denzel, Viola, this son and one of Troy's brother Gabriel who is mentally ill due to being injuried in WWI and his co-worker/friend Jim Bono standing, sitting and arguing about everything from money, work, furniture, baseball, football and life.Now the film itself was a bit slow in parts but you forget all that when Denzel and Viola have their scenes together. Their is a scene in the film I can't really talk about because it's a very important scene in the movie but it's you've seen the film then you know what I'm talking about where Viola pours out her heart and soul to Denzel to try to make him understand how she feels, now that's why she got and earned that Oscars. Watch the film and tell me that scene won't make you shade some tears. Another scene and a scene that is a personal favorite of mines is where the son ask Troy if he likes him and Denzel gives this whole big speech about how it's his job to provide for him and his mother, it's not his job to like him. Ooh that scene was great and that's the part that should have won Denzel the Oscars but like I said it went to Casey which I've already mention and won't get into at the moment. Theirs a lot of emotional scenes but they add so much drama to the film and it's really interesting to watch.Now that we got all that out of the way let me tell you what I feel about the film. Now I saw it twice, once on blu-ray and I liked it so much I wanted my parents to see it so I rented it again on DVD so we could watch it together. Now you have to understand my Dad is a western/war type guy I didn't think he'd be interested in a film about African-Americans standing around arguing about money or what have you BUT he loved it. I was surprised when he told me thought the film was really interesting and that's saying something coming from a man who only really watches western films.Should you rent this film. No you shouldn't rent this film! You should BUY this film. It's that good. Now it's not for everything so I would rent it if you're not sure but trust me you'll want to add it to your collection."

",0.3612,0.9974,2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,"Denzel Washington and Viola Davis deserved co-Best Actor Awards for Wilson's 21st Century companion piece to Miller's Death of a Salesman. Troy and Willy are counterparts, both hoping for good results from bad practices; both flawed, but trying to love in their broken, misguided ways; both irreparably flawed, but going down fighting. Viola Davis is magnificent in her role as Rose, a woman who chooses again and again to sacrificially love, and yet to stand strong and beautiful in her suffering. She sees what no one else, except perhaps Troy's best friend Bono (Stephen Henderson) sees, and she chooses over and over to do the ""right"" or righteous thing. The story is as much about her, a magnificent human being, nearly perfect in her ways, who maintains her dignity, who earns the respect of her children, and who wears a cross around her neck without hypocrisy. Mykelti Williamson's portrayal of Gabriel was excellent. He plays the role of the blind prophet, the wise fool, the unknowing fortune teller with an accuracy and a sweetness that at times nearly steals the scenes in which he plays. The partial shot of him, sitting with his back to the camera, saying, ""I'm ready for my sandwich now!"" is both comical and moving. When he stands between Troy and Rose after Troy reveals his infidelity, his presence creates a gut-wrenching fugue of dissonance that deepens Rose's agony, and silences Troy's excuses. Williams becomes Gabriel. The ending, though a little ""out there"" is touching to the point of astounding as Gabriel's horn finally reaches the heavens. I loved this movie, and I cried with Cory (Jovan Adepo), as he struggled with the inner demons who were driving him to hate his father in the same way his father hated his father. I found hope in this story, and grace, and mercy. Oh! Troy and Rose's backyard, unlike the Loman backyard, was growing plants, and by the end of the story, even a rose bush was blooming. August Wilson's hopeful symbolism profoundly touched me, and gave me hope. Highly Recommended."

""Fences"" has wonderful acting, not only from Washington and Davis, but it plays like - well, like a play on a proscenium stage.I'm sure the director (Washington both directed and starred) made the artistic choice to remain as close to the stage play as possible. However, some judicious editing to tighten the play (particularly the dialogue) would have been best.Plan your evening accordingly. Make lots of popcorn, pause the DVD playback for trips to the bathroom and/or refrigerator, and be aware that you need to listen to what's being said and prepare to feel for these people - because you will feel for them if you are paying attention."

While directing by Denzel Washington was OK i guess (as there isn't really much going on in this movie, except for talking), great script and amazing performances carries this movie. I won't lie, i liked the overall movie and although i wasn't blow away by it, i liked this slow burning drama. Denzel Washington and Viola Davis were both absolutely stunning as a husband and a wife, living in 1950s USA. Husband Troy isn't perfect to say the least, and he is not a model father to say the least as well, but he is a good man while Rose tries to glue family together. There are also some racial undertones in here, but they are far and in between. Yet i struggled to see some deeper messages here in this story, it isn't really deep or anything, yet great script makes it worth seeing.Overall, this is a one rare film which you can basically watch because of great performances and solid as well as involving script. There isn't any action in this movie, this is a pure drama which at running time 2 h 13 min can drag here and there, but nevertheless is worth to see it once."

The Oscars are a big deal to me and I'm a huge film buff so naturally I had to watch it. I watched the film with high expectations, and all I got in return was a huge frown, from a boring film. Let me start with the positives (although there are few), the acting in this film is remarkable, Denzel Washington was fantastic and this film could be the best performance of his career. The same can be said for Viola Davis, she delivers a fantastic performance that is both heartbreaking and responsive. But for me personally, this is where the magic disappeared.The negative side of this film was everything else, the film had very little story and what little story it did have, it simply didn't grab me with much interest. And although the film is called 'Fences' there is very little mention of Troy (Denzel Washington's character) building the fence he says he's going to build, and when he is building his fence, he is berating his son Cory.That is all I have to say about 'Fences'. In summary, it is a film that had so much promise, but only delivered a boring film about an abusive father who is trying to raise his family."

I read some mixed reviews about this film and I'm on the side that says it's good, a bit long for what it was trying to deliver, but good. This film didn't need all of the thrills or heavy duty suspense to stay afloat. With brilliant and top notch actors like Denzel Washington and Viola Davis playing the leads their performances alone will make this film something worth seeing. Being that this film is from a stage play it's almost as if this were just a stage play done on a movie set, that's probably why it had so many bad reviews but I think the director (Denzel Washington) wanted it that way. This is purely a drama film delivered well by some of the most brilliant acting I have ever seen. I must admit, it does take a little while for the story to get good but it's well worth the wait. If you're into drama filled experiences with lots of symbolism and good acting I highly recommend this film."
" Impressive acting but very slow.
",0.2846,0.9967,2017-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Fences is a strong drama film that is based on an award winning play by August Wilson (also wrote the script). It is a powerful drama about Troy (Denzel Washington), who lives with his wife Rose (Viola Davis), and their son Cory (Jovan Adepo). Troy is stuck in the past about the hardship of choices and actions that he has experienced and is having difficulties accepting the choices that his son wants to make. Story takes place in the 1950s Pittsburgh. Troy is not an easy person for anyone to try to get along with, as his other son Lyons (Russel Hornsby) rejected the idea of getting a job that Troy insisted on helping him get, just so he can be a musician at a club. While his other son, Cory wants to play football. Which displeases Troy cause he believes playing sports is not going to get him anywhere in life and would rather him work at a job for living. Fences is a film that does feel like it's a play. Small set pieces that only takes place at Troy's home, or down the streets of Pittsburgh. These characters are in these set pieces with long periods of conversations. Which it does not make it a terrible film. The script is slow moving but very strong when it comes to character dynamics for a drama storyteller. The cast of Fences all did a phenomenal job in their roles. Denzel Washington is a great actor all around, playing a character that is stuck in his time of a man needing to work hard and be responsible. Viola Davis is a stunning actress and this has to be one of her best roles yet. The rest of the cast are unknown actors but have been in theatre playing the same characters like Mykelti Williamson, Russell Hornsby, and Stephen Henderson. The direction was pretty impressive, sticking to old school filmmaking in handling a slow moving drama film. Small set pieces, minimum use of a music score, and soft editing. Washington did well in capturing great performances with every actor on film. Overall, Fences is a good film with amazing performances in a slow moving drama film. I will rate it 4 out of 5 stars."

",0.1027,0.9959,2017-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Films that are made from theatre source material can be a chore to sit through, but the best ones play so well that the dialogue alone moves the story. Plays are mainly dialogue, because all the actors have behind them are static sets so some imagination is involved in moving along the story. The best plays that are made into movies keep this flavor alive, and only add little cinematic effects to enhance rather than detract, and that's exactly what Fences does. This is Denzel Washington's third movie as a director and while previous outings Antwone Fisher and The Great Debaters were both very good, this is probably his most universally appealing and a well-acted one. Washington and Viola Davis give the best performances of a male and female lead this year, leading to scenes so intense and true to life that it is is easy to overlook how powerful they are or how other actors would have played them wrong. Lack of success can make people bitter and act out in ways that have awful consequences for their loved ones, and as flawed as these characters are, it is impossible not to hope they can all find some measure of peace with each other. We are them and they are us, and we all want love and understanding at a basic level, especially when we are at our worst."

They say ""empty vessels make the most noise"" and here is a case in point. Set in the early fifties, race plays a strong card in every aspect of life, and Troy feels betrayed by a failed baseball career that – in his eyes at least – looked over his skills to the colour of his skin. But Troy is also a stubborn cuss, and refuses to acknowledge that even in the 50's ""The times they are a changing'"". His cussedness puts him on a collision course with his teenage son Cory (Jovan Adepo), given his aspirations for a college football scholarship, and his mother (Viola Davis, ""The Help"") tries to keep the peace between the two of them.This is a film primarily about resistance to change. All those changes in the outside world are on the 'other side of the fence' that Troy habitually tries to finish but never seems to put his mind to. Fences keep things out; but they also keep things in, and Troy is in a cocoon of his own making. He justifies his actions as a 'family provider' with lengthy speeches but ultimately they deliver hollow words and assertions that don't stand up to scrutiny.This is a pressure cooker of family life that is primed to blow, and a revelation (which I didn't see coming) sets that fuse alight.This is a film worth watching for the acting performances of Denzel Washington and (particularly) Viola Davis, winner of the Best Supporting Actress BAFTA and a strong contender for the Oscar. Both give assured performances, although Troy is such an instantly dis- likable and pitiable character that I could feel my emotions influencing my judgement about his performance. But this is also a strong ensemble cast, with Mykelti Williamson (famously appearing as Bubba of the 'Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory' fame) being effective as Troy's disabled brother and English-born Jovan Adepo being particularly impressive in an extremely assured feature debut.However, the Broadway roots of the piece are highly visible with 98% of the film set either in the back yard, in the house, or on the front steps (the set could clearly rotate!). For such a claustrophobic topic, this is perhaps apt. But as a feature film I longed for the action to go elsewhere. The film version of the story – with a few tweaks to the screenplay – has lots of opportunities for this, but these are never taken. This makes the whole piece feel 'worthy but dull'. In particular, anyone looking for a useful tutorial on fence building needs to look elsewhere!As for the recent ""Moonlight"" there is also excessive use of the ""N"" word and other outdated racial references that have the potential to offend.Good luck to Viola Davis and Denzel Washington (who also directed this) for their Best Supporting Actress and Best Actor Oscars nominations. But ""Best Film"" Oscar? No, I don't think so. In truth this is a film that I will struggle to remember or get excited about in a month's time and it will not be on my re-watch list.(This review was written just prior to the 2017 Oscars.

" Excellent Movie Review contains spoilers
",0.5719,0.9123,2017-03-18 00:00:00,10,"***Contains SpoilersI finally watched this movie tonight and it was excellent. No, its not a thriller, an action adventure or a sci-fi movie, it is a movie about life. The life of a couple in the 1950's where men were viewed differently and so was the role of a woman. The acting was superb and the mentality of the main character was developed as you learned his childhood, early adulthood and all the things that led him to where he was and created a man struggling, self centered and prideful. I am a woman in her late forties and the movie is quite accurate in its depiction of the character being illiterate and believing finding a labor trade is the only real stability for a black man. It is uniquely true as well that a woman in Viola Davis role (Rose) would go along to get along and lean on the church for comfort and never consider leaving her husband.In these days women had few options and to have a man that wouldn't leave was something to cherish at all cost.You either have to have the age to understand this position or with wisdom appreciate their was a time these characters were more the norm than the exception to enjoy this movie. Not everything is for everyone but this is a glimpse back in to what was a realistic portrayal of an African American family in the 50s."
" The trouble with Fences is...
",-0.4019,0.8586,2017-03-18 00:00:00,6,"the film fails to expand upon August Wilson's stage version. While sticking true to the play, the film does not adapt well on the big screen. Simply put, it does not introduce the viewer to the 1950's Hill District, or Pittsburgh in a larger context. Why not show Troy's interactions beyond his home or Corey's success on the football field?...something impossible on the small stage. While a poignant story Fences is better left for the stage."

How Denzel did not win best actor and/or best director is beyond me. This movie is a bit like watching a play and reminded me a lot of death of a salesmen. Denzel is amazing in this role. He reminds us of how hard life was and can still be. He's an SOB who is dedicated to providing for his family as a man, but fails as one as well. He's strong and weak, leaving behind both anger, resentment, and yet love. This movie is fairly painful to watch and you don't walk away feeling much for him in the end. He's not a hero. He is just a man that tried, struck to it each day and made a life for those around him even though it was not pretty it was something they could hold on to. The movie also does a very good job of showing the perspective from each of the characters. Often movies only represent the main character, but you can see the pain of each of the characters as if the movie was their story. Well done ."

To me tomorrow is what Grand Final Day is to sports fans.I'll be watching the Academy awards live and perhaps lunching royalty while I await my predictions or others to eventuate. Fences I did not enjoy as a movie but Viola Davis is stunning as Rose Maxson the devoted mother and self sacrificing wife and I predict a shoe in certainty for the Best Supporting Actress award tomorrow Denzel Washington gives a great performance but this movie is so obviously a film of a stage play. I think it's too long, especially the first half and over directed by Denzel Washington.His character which I found lo.ud and utterly unlikeable ,which is not a complaint about Denzel Washington's acting it's the dialogue of the playwright he was performing but at times almost made me want to leave the movie but I'm glad I didn't as the second half and conclusion was worth sitting through this play.

" Fences almost makes it.
",0.0,0.9841,2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,"Fences is a movie that shines so bright until the last 15 minutes. The dialogue and acting are probably the best you will see in a movie all year. Denzel is spectacular. You can see a bit of the stage acting come off in his performance but he survives it.Viola is masterful in her role. You feel her pain and forget she is an actress. Jovan Adepo does well in his role as her son though his emotional acting needs a little practice.Okay, acting aside...I'd say 85-90% of this movie takes place in one house or its backyard. Despite this the plot moves forward smoothly through our characters and never seems to lose focus. The trailer is good enough to not give away major plot points and Troy (Denzel Washington) comes off as a bit of a surprise considering how they build him up at first. Yes, he lives in the past and is not the most loving father but he is portrayed as an honest man who loves his wife and works hard.As the story unfolds this becomes less so when he reveals that he used his disabled brother's, who is a war veteran, money to buy the house they live in. To his credit, he feels much shame and guilt about this but it sure didn't stop him from screwing his brother over again later in the movie when he commits him.Then, quite abruptly, he tells his wife that he is having a child by another woman. She is shocked and appalled and he responds by telling her to basically get over it. It is a powerful scene in which both actors really shine.After this his relationship with her 17 year old son really deteriorates and this leads to a final confrontation between them both. Troy tells her son to leave after a short physical altercation and her son does in fact leave to go join the Marines.This is the moment the movie falls...and hard.Six years pass and the son returns to the home for Troy's funeral. Troy's daughter, out of wedlock, has been raised by Rose (Viola Davis)and is bounding around the house doing everything but getting dressed for the funeral. Cory (Adepo) arrives to meet his half-brother and Troy's best friend inside the house where they have a short conversation.Cory walks to the backyard and when his mother arrives he tells her he isn't going to the funeral. She responds quite negatively to this and they have a, far too long, conversation about Troy. I noticed Viola's quality in acting dropped slightly for the end of the movie as well which was disappointing considering how amazing she was up to this point. The little girl comes outside after Rose goes back into the house and she shares a, far too long, moment with her brother in which they sing a song that Troy taught them.Then it happens. The worst part of the movie. Troy's brother comes running down the alley by the house yelling, ""Rose, I'm here! I'm here!"" To this, everyone in the house runs outside to meet him in the backyard. He goes on about telling St. Peter to open the gates for Troy and then yells Troy's name toward the sky in a very ""KHAN!"" like moment. Then he raises a trumpet, which he carries the whole movie, and eventually gets one steady note to play toward the sky. With this, the freaking clouds part and the sun shines through. All the characters stare up at it in amazement and the movie suddenly has a very ridiculous feeling about it. This is an, ""Oh no, why did they do this?"" moment.This movie for me was a strong 9/10 up until the last 15 minutes or so. Then it dips to about a 5/10. The acting, writing, and technical shooting of the movie is brilliant up until the end and is so good the movie still gets an 8/10 despite such an amazingly horrible ending.Worth watching for sure but when Cory leaves the home just turn it off and imagine any kind of ending for this movie. It will be better than actually watching the ending."
" Viola Davis Oscar worthy? Absolutely!! For Denzel Washington this was nothing more than a vanity role.
",0.6549,0.9852,2017-03-14 00:00:00,6,"Mrs. Shullivan and I were really looking forward to watching this four (4) time Oscar nominated film with two perennial stars in Viola Davis and Denzel Washington. After watching the first 20 minutes though of nothing more than the 53 year old garbage man Troy Maxon (Denzel Washington) talking trash rather than picking it up Mrs. Shullivan and I looked at each other and simultaneously asked...""what's that awful smell?""But we agreed to hang in there to see whether or not Troy would eventually build that fence in his backyard that he has been promising to build for his wife of eighteen (18) years whose name is Rose (Viola Davis). With all the self promotion that Denzel and Viola provided prior to the release of Fences which was a well received stage play written by August Wilson and drafted for the large screen we anticipated that with all this talent they would know how to transfer a stage play into a film version. Sadly, this was not the case and we felt as if it was a ""staged play"" filmed and edited for a video release.We love live theater and I am sure the original theater play was very powerful and moving when you see the quality of the story line. Here is a troubled man named Troy Maxon, a murderer, ex-convict who seems to have turned his life around and found steady employment as a sanitary engineer, who likes his booze on the weekends, but he also likes his broads. So Troy decides to penetrate three (3) different women once every seventeen (17) years apart and father three (3) children with three different (3) women. I loved Viola Davis's role as Troy's second wife Rose, and she was absolutely deserving of her Oscar award. As for Denzel, I have a bit of advice for you. Either choose to direct, or choose to act, but don't try and accomplish both because I think your ego got the better of you and for the first two (2) hours of this film it was all about you. It was nothing more, and nothing less than a vanity role. You were no ray of sunshine as the ending would have you portrayed as being.I think the 56 year old Laurence Fishburne, or the 69 year old Samuel L. Jackson or the 53 year old Blair Underwood would have provided more substance to the role of Troy Maxon and Denzel, as their director you could have drawn a stellar performance out of any of these three fine actors.I rate the film an 8 out of 10 for Viola Davis's excellent performance but I must subtract 2 points for Denzel's self-indulgent and over the top scene stealing over the first two hours. Remember Denzel....it's not all about you...at least not anymore."
" How did Moonlight beat this movie for Best Picture?
",0.6369,0.9628,2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"After seeing ""Moonlight"", I thought it was over rated and did not deserve the ""Best Picture Academy Award"". Today, I saw ""Fences"" and it is head and shoulders better than ""Moonlight"". Much more profound and thoughtful, with overall better acting performances and even the script seemed more realistic although ""Moonlight"" supposedly is based on the true story of the producer growing up. Much better done overall, so I have to ask why ""Moonlight"" won the award, and not ""Fences""? Was there some kind of backlash against Denzel Washington or some Hollywood insider voting to give a ""no-name"" or ""lesser name"" some notoriety. For what it is worth, I give this movie an ""8"", whereas I gave a ""5"" to ""Moonlight"" as my votes here at IMDb."

That is really all that i can say about this film without getting into spoilers. A life story with a lot of details and emotions. A film like this can't be made this well without a talented cast. That is why Fences heavily relies on powerful performances! Viola is extraordinary but Denzel is out of this world... The way they play off each other almost feels like the cameras are rolling on a real married couple whit hopes, dreams and nightmares. The smile, laugh, and fight at every single scene are like a perfect moment. Fences ends up being for me the best picture of the year! Overall, Fences due to its very specific style of storytelling delivers without a doubt a very well-made and rare picture. A incredible well-told and emotionally striking drama that everyone shouldn't miss."
" Fences ShowMeTheMovies Review
",0.0,0.9882,2017-03-12 00:00:00,5,"Style really does take priority over substance for Denzels' one-man-band; a whole lot of fuss for a film quite ordinary.Fences in many ways mimics a 1989 film, Do the Right Thing, which essentially tells a tale of life, with no intentions to over-dramatise or show a Hollywood filter over events. The idea of Fences is paved with good intentions - it is not a cash-grab like past Denzel Washington movies have been, and the plot does flow at a consistent rate. That consistent rate in question happens to be, however, a sluggishly slow rate.The movie seems to make a big fuss out of every little event that occurs; the opening of the film is a twenty minute conversation between Troy (Washington), his wife Rose (Viola Davis) and his best friend, Jim Bono (Stephen Henderson), with little context or connection to the rest of the film, with no other purpose than to make the characters appear more relatable - but this scene was far too drawn out to be a Tarantino-esque dialogue masterpiece.Despite these attempts, Troy is not a relatable character at all either, in fact most of the decisions he makes throughout the movie are completely unreasonable and yet as the main character he is painted out to be the moral authority. The idea of excusing him for his actions simply because he is from a troubled background with many difficult situations to deal with at once, is not how the movie should deal with his character. A character can only be excused for their unrelatable actions if their reasons for their actions are relatable, which in this case, they are not.Troy was played well by Washington, and most actors did a great job as a whole. Viola Davis was excellent in her role, and was essentially perfectly cast; Cory (Jovan Adepo) was good as Troy and Rose's son, attempting to impress his father constantly, and the emotions he conveyed whenever Troy would do something he disagreed with were authentic and natural as a performance.The problem Fences has is that it doesn't really go anywhere. The film has great actors, and environment for those characters to be in, but no opportunity to make a fantastic film out of a worthy script, which has some lines which even repeat during the movie.Fences does not really have a premise, there isn't a moral of the story and it appears like the film was put together as an idea before the script was even written to be able to simulate 'real life' action and conversation, but there was no need for all of this self-celebratory pretentious style which made the movie irritating to watch.I never found myself engrossed in the plot at all, and I couldn't recommend this since I barely found myself caring about how events would unfold or what would happen to the characters.https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/review-fences.html"

It's Academy Awards wins pumped it up to be more than it really was and the Red Carpet reviews among fellow actors/actresses pumped it up even more than it's value, if that value was to be judged solely by it's Oscar nominations alone.The screenplay adaptation was just plain awful! It felt more like a very long cold-read at a very bad audition. It's no wonder ""Manchester by the Sea"" beat it at the Academy Awards. And, rightly so.It was basically 2 whole hours of pretty much non-stop monotonous dialogue to set up a 10-minute ""cheating man"" montage, followed by another 10 minutes of the only part of the movie worth seeing — the funeral scene, which was the only part of the movie that didn't have Denzel Washington showing off a showcase of monologues calling himself, his family, his friends and just about every other black person in existence, the ""N"" word."

The last such good one was Midnight in Paris.Fences captivates through intense dialogues. These reveal present family problems, and pleasant or dramatical aspects of the past. Tory has had a rough upbringing (left home as a teen, prison) that left traces in his personality. Later in life, he experiences anger toward his son and is unfaithful. He prides himself on how he managed to raise his family despite the adversities. It is up to viewer to evaluate the worthiness of his life, especially if the viewer has a family. I don't have a problem with movies that contain little scenery and mainly talking (eg Carnage) if the talking is interesting. That's the case here- we are imbued into 50s black culture and the language is savorous. The script also touches social topics such as union and racism (eg the drivers are white) Interesting is also that Tory's best friend Bono is white, he calls him ""niggar"" and Bono shares some of his culture. Fences resembles the good ol' Spike Lee creations.--- I found the close ups unnecessary and making the filming more confined than it should be. The last 20-30 minutes could have been cut; at some point in the end it became preachy goody-good Hollywood style. Sure, more scenes showing the neighbourhood would have been nice (as in A Bronx Tale)- perhaps they would have affected the budget."

This film depicts with great realism a poor African American family of the 50s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Washington is middle-aged, works as a garbage man, has a loving wife (played by Viola Davis), two children and a house — a decent living by most standards, but Washington is unhappy despite the many times we see him smile and grin. Unfulfilled dreams, the bitterness he holds on to due to the racism he and many blacks endured for so long, and the constant repetition of his weekly routine year after year has taken a toll on him, making him do something that will threaten to destroy his marriage and everything he worked so hard to build should his secret come to light.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Fences"" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Washington's secret comes out and he has an explosive argument with Davis. One can feel the pain, disappointment, and rage so much that Washington and Davis, for a moment, cease to be actors and become real people whose lives are rapidly crushed within a span of minutes.For those who are unaware of the origin of ""Fences,"" it started as a play; and the movie stays true to its roots.

Rose just plays the typical 50's dutiful house wife with very little backbone and allows Troy to walk all over her like most women on screen in the time period.

Denzel Washington recreates his Broadway role (along with many of the other Broadway cast members) and directs this stunning film with extraordinary sensitivity.The play/film touches on many aspects - racism, the manner in which the world viewed Black Americans in the middle of the last century, marital infidelity, the impact of war injuries on wounded soldiers, the role women endured, child raising tensions, death, and more – and in the case of each the actors offer fully fleshed out performances of the characters August Wilson so intelligently created.Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) makes his living as a sanitation worker in 1956 Pittsburgh along side his best friend Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson). Maxson once dreamed of becoming a professional baseball player, but when the major leagues began admitting black athletes he was 40 years old and was refused the permission to play. Bitter over his missed opportunity, Troy creates further tension in his family when he squashes his son's Cory (Jovan Adepo) chance to meet a college football recruiter. Troy lives in a small house with his stalwart wife Rose (Viola Davis) and Cory, and sometimes his war injured mentally impaired brother Gabe (Mykelti Williamson). Troy's son by a previous relationship Lyons (Russell Hornsby) drops by every Friday, Troy's payday, to ask for money to support his dream of life as a successful musician. Troy holds his life together as best he can, concentrates on building a fence that Rose requests, but has an affair on the side that results in a pregnancy – a schism that almost destroys his relationship with Rose. But when the baby is born as the mother dies, Troy brings the baby home to Rose who compassionately cares for the child. Time passes and much changes, but to offer more of that would provide spoilers.The brilliance of acting by the entire cast is staggering and the film works on every level. One of the finest films in many years."

But honestly the fire exit sign was more exciting , I found myself constantly comparing it with what was on screen and trying to assure myself that the film was more watchable but it wasn't . This may work well on stage with a single set , but what on earth did they spend $24m on , yes there was an authentic looking late 1950s Pittsburg but one of the adjoining house to Rose's was brand new ! Her Oscar was well deserved and there was some good acting by the supporting cast particularly his brother Gabe and young daughter . He was such a despicable character that took out his failure on his son that spoilt the enjoyment . It was the son's strength that brought some salvation. The film was an hour too long , far too much dialogue delivered at breakneck speed , it needed better adaptation to the screen and script editing and more than anything it shouldn't have even been released Give it a miss , save yourself 2.5 hours of looking at the inside of your eyelids !"

The whole time the father is doing that he doesn't realize that he's putting a heavy weight on him and his wife. That soon causes relationship problems between them.

The tension increases in his family when he confesses to Rose that he has a mistress that is pregnant. Meanwhile he has been building a fence in the limits of his real estate.""Fences"" is a heavy drama in the 50's in a black community with a black family. The lead character Troy Maxson is not a bad man; actually he is a provider that delivers his paycheck to his wife. However, he is an illiterate man that treats his son the way he was treated in the past. He tries to protect him from the disappointments he had with sports and is unable to see that times are changing. But his attitudes build a fence between his family and he and Troy ends the story alone. The performances are top-notch and Viola Davis and Denzel Washington deserve the nominations to the Oscar.

" Cinema in its purest act
",0.0,0.9977,2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"""Fences"" is a completely passionate film, it is troubled, familiar, ruthless, romantic, charismatic and brutal, engraved 50% on the back of a house in an American suburb in the 50s it shows the story of Troy Maxson (Denzel Washington) A 53-year-old father of a family who works as a garbage collector and fight to support his family, living at age 18 with his wife Rose (Viola Davis), he begins to face problems in his relationship and in his family. It is an adjusted script, capable of having a 20 minute long scene between 3 characters sitting talking, the film is unique and exclusively dialogue, and best of all, this makes the film highly attractive, its 2 hours and little seemed 20 minutes To me, the script full of great dialogues added to stupendous performances make a movie that had everything to be dragged to have a spectacular rhythm. We have a family history, with events that can happen in any family, it is beautiful to demonstrate the beauty of the causes in the family, yes, he is beautiful in demonstrating the problems, however incredible it may seem, the film does not have a great Moral, it just shows how love can be gross, that we do not choose who we love or how we love, but simply, we love. We have a good picture, with an extremely gray color palette, a timid soundtrack - although the music is present in an extremely sentimental way in the film - a great set-up and camera angles that practically act as a character in the movie, between To the dialogues the camera splices against planes and planes sequences, it turns, turns, profiles and is even subjective when needed, the camera acts in history as mere viewers, and even when the camera stands still on the tripe, the characters move from one Side to side, as if they were in a theater, is very delicious. In terms of acting, we have the best in film in 20I6, Denzel Washington is a completely incredible character, his acting is terrifying and at the same time completely emotional, he swallows the camera, steals the scene, it grows to such a point that we are without Reaction, we want to throw the popcorn off, sit glued to the screen, listen to its history and its lessons, learn about the cruelty of love, hate, love, fear and respect. Viola Davis is also wonderful, she does not shed tears, she drool, tears, falls, she surrenders completely to characters, that little screen corner in the film, she grabs hard, her dramatic load is enormous, and when Denzel Does not appear in the film and leaves the camera free for Viola, she also swallows it with extreme ferocity, would be very happy if both took the acting Oscar - but we know only Viola will take. And congratulations to Denzel Washington who also shines in the direction, I0 years later he returns to direct, and concretizes the best work of his career. Finally, we have a simple movie, that enters the house of a family to tell us their stories, we do not have a technically brilliant film, we have a fabulous rhythm, incredible performances, and a story that marks, finally, we have a great movie that It's purp cinema."
" Fences: A Unique Movie That Celebrates Life And Death
",-0.0516,0.9934,2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"In her Oscar speech, the wonderful Viola Davis gave away the reason why she's an actress. She said she wants to tell stories that celebrate life. That's exactly what Fences is about. Celebrating the whole journey.Fences is about a man, with so many fallen dreams. You can look at him and his dreams with very different lenses. You can see a man who has killed his own dreams, a man who chose to be miserable, stiff and unable to enjoy the little things in life. You can also see him as an innocent hardworking one who was pulled down with weights bigger than he could carry. You can see him as a lucky man considering his doings, who has a job, a family and a very good friend. And you can see him as all of these in one human being. There will be things you'll appreciate and others you don't, and that depends on who you are as a person.Fences is also about poverty, about love and respect and how fine a line can be drawn between both. It's about the difference between what we can change and what we will have to accept. It is about choices. It is about our minds, how and what we choose to believe. There are also painful scenes about mental illness, painful and poetic and true. My personal opinion is that race is not one of the themes as others have pointed out. I guess the story is very universal, very inclusive.The acting in the whole movie was one of the best I have ever seen. Amazing direction, amazing screenplay. Maybe the first 30 minutes weren't very eventful or purposeful, but the overall slow rate and steady rhythm were important to the story as a whole.People who love slow movies, with good drama and realistic characters may enjoy this. I don't know if we can learn something out of it, just enjoy it or have some good discussions about its themes. I guess it offers something different for everyone."

" Full of raw power but quite comes alive as a film
",0.5883,0.9358,2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"Full of raw power, the dialogue and performances in this are pure vitality. Troy is a compelling character of real human dichotomies, someone you can loathe and love in equal measure. His baseball analogies verge on the embarrassing he's so obsessed with them, which in hindsight makes me a little sad.This film never comes alive as a film however, it always feels slightly restrained as an obvious adaptation of a play. I've never really understood this critique of plays-into-movies before (feeling that character and dialogue will trump lack of settings and fancy camera work) but watching this, and seeing how some of the scenes are awkward with how the actors are standing around, then randomly sitting down and being so careful with their stage movements. It wasn't fully engaging me viscerally as a film. Too many unnecessary close-ups of people's faces when dialogue becomes ""important"". Also weird CGI or something with some of the backgrounds and the tree at the end?I also felt Denzel was projecting a bit too much at times - like he was still giving a stage performance. I understand his character ""filled a room"" with his personality, and to that extent he succeeds, but I still couldn't shake that feeling. Viola is the best snot cryer in the biz."
" Moderate adaption of a stage script
",0.0,-0.8823,2017-02-27 00:00:00,4,"With a total of 139 min one might think this movie is packed with stories. But no. It is extremely long paced and for the most part boring. The acting is spot on and the dialogues portrait life the way it could have happened to this family. But I basically just lost over two hours of my life listening to some insignificant dialogues which I would've ignored if I would've overheard them in real life. It took him more than 1,5 hours to even start with his fence. I mean really how can you get so easily distracted the first 200 times you try to start building a fence. This somewhat enraged me. I know - one can argue - that the fence is just a mere metaphor. But it is also a vital task!This might be a good script for the stage, but it hasn't been very well adapted on the screen. Viola's acting is superb, though. And the final scene is gold. But it's not worth the chore of waiting over two hours for that."
" Powerhouse performances make for an affecting family drama
",0.0,0.997,2017-02-26 00:00:00,9,"While not cinematic in the purest sense of the word, this stageplay come to life as a feature film; whilst staying very much close to the roots of its stage-set origins, is a captivating piece of cinema that enthrals and shocks purely through its use of brilliantly brought to life and commanding performances moulded almost perfectly together with a gut-punch of a script by late playwright August Wilson.Denzel Washington's third feature film as a director and by far his most accomplished, Fences see's the well regarded actor bring back the stage plays core cast for another go around and it works wonders for Fences ability to draw in the audience despite what initially seems like a questionable run-time.For 130 or so minutes of the run-time attached to Fences, we barely leave the residence of Washington's hardworking yet equally as hardhearted garbage collection/bitter ex-sports star Troy Maxson and his fellow co-inhabitants, Viola Davis's caring and long-suffering wife/mother Rose and rightfully angry son Cory, whose recent foray into the possibility of becoming a pro-athlete spurns on many a heated family discussion, but the film never once feels like it's not doing or saying something.Sometimes visited by Troy's mentally handicapped ex-soldier brother Gabe, best friend Jim or Troy's oldest son Lyons, the household of the Maxson family becomes a battleground for these clashing souls and becomes the playground for the considerable acting chops of Washington and Davis in particular, who have honed their incarnations of these characters down to a fine art over their time in the stage version of this story so that every moment of love, anger or resentment feels whole-heartedly real.They are in many ways showy performances, there's ample time for tears, shouting and considered looks but there's no denying that they combine into one of the best double acts seen on screen in sometime.Since I had partaken in the quiet power of Manchester by the Sea, I felt fairly confident that the soon to be announced Best Actor Oscar was Casey Affleck's for the taking but with Washington taking control of every ounce of Troy's being, it's an award that you wish could be shared between the two differently styled actors but Washington you feel has the edge with Troy providing the veteran performer one of his most memorable roles.Every scene with Washington in it, particularly the films early onslaughts, allow the actor time and space to show off his impressive prowess and when Troy is unhappy about something (which is more often than not), Washington will have you glued to your seat, unable to take your eyes off his captivating turn.Not to be outdone however, Viola Davis's owns Rose's presence in the film and while Troy is a character we want to side with despite his many various faults and sins, Rose is a character that will break your heart as she tries desperately and earnestly to do the best with what she's been given and as is the general consensus, Davis is as bankable as you'd like when considering who is taking home this year's Best Supporting Actress Oscar.While it will be to stagey and wordy for some, Fences offers one of modern cinemas rare chances to see a film driven and brought to life purely through the art of acting whilst offering an insightful look at black lives in 1950's America. A refreshingly scaled back cinematic experience in many ways, just as its awards cohort Manchester by the Sea, Fences is full of heart, seething emotion and genuinely outstanding acting turns and is one of the best stage to film adaptations of the modern era.4 ½ trumpets out of 5"

" Glorious acting that should be on stage.
",0.6369,0.9993,2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"August Wilson's dramatic theatre play is brought to the screen by the hands of the passionate actor/director Denzel Washington.Set in 1950s Pittsburgh, Troy Maxons (Washington) returns home to his wife Rose (Viola Davis) and son Cory (Jovan Adepo) where he can earn the hard weeks work to where he regales his life experience upon his wife and friend, control the life of his son, and make a start on putting up a fence in his garden. Traveling in a absent distance of time, we watch as the family tension increases, as Troy ignorantly makes his stand as the man of the house and will continue tot point that out to everyone around him. As the dram continues the fence is gradually being built, but Wilson has not just created a fence as set piece, but all characters have their own metaphorical fence that they are using for their own reasons.What has clearly caught the Academy's attention is the powerful, and brilliant performances by Washington and Davis, and surprising by the supporting role Mykelti Williamson claims. Being 4 years since Washington's last nomination, and has since been filling that time by appearing in mainstream action blockbusters The Equalizer and recent Magnificent Seven remake, Washington proves he is still as talented as he ever was. Claiming the majority of the supporting actress awards is Viola Davis, who especially shines as the innocent housewife of Washington, evens out the balance of terrific acting that Washington sets. Most definitely going to claim that Oscar for herself, if not Naomi Harris or Michelle Williams. But the big tension is whether Washington will steal it from Affleck. I still hold faith that the Academy will make the right decision with Affleck, but rightly deserved nomination for Washington is also just.It is crystal clear that Washington has great love and passion for Wilson's script, as from also appearing on the stage play. Old Denzel shows that he knows these lines in his sleep, and definitely brings justice to the play on screen, but that is the issue.With Charlotte Bruus Christensen panning the camera around the comfortable set piece that through the 2hr and 18ms length we get very cosy with, we at witnessing acting happening in front of us, like being a theatre audience member. It cannot be denied that Washington brings the theatre experience alive on screen, but this is not where the story belongs. Watching the sensational performances in front is an experience that I would have preferred to see on the stage, which weakens the Fences' position as a film, making it feel like someone as actually just film the play.What one redeeming factor that film adaptation has brought is its rather well used editing by Hughes Winborne, but even when montage flashes and score arrive it takes away the authenticity of the acting in front of me, which therefore makes work better as a on stage play. Although I have nor seen the play, the film made wish I was watching the play.The film ending impact left me a similar feeling from familiar play adaptation August Osage County(2013), by dragging all warm emotions in me and leaving me feeling empty. So to say that its depressing is an under statement, but concluding with a satisfactory emotional end.Fences therefore becomes a hard hitting drama, made by the very accomplished performances from the cast, with a very uncanny appearance of the stage play, and an unnecessarily long length. With a nomination for Best Picture, I must say that I do not think this a good decision by the Academy, as I cannot recommend it as a film but as a frame of amazing acting. 8.2/10"
" Simple yet ever so effective
",0.6113,0.9972,2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"I said during my review of 'Moonlight' that some undeserving films were being nominated at the Academy Awards this year because of last year's #Oscarssowhite controversy. 'Fences' is not one of those films. 'Fences' is entirely deserving of all four awards it has been nominated for. As for actually winning them it may be a different matter, but the nominations are unquestionable. It's a film that is very simple at its core. Almost the entire film takes place in one setting, and there's really only one notable plot point that occurs throughout the entire film, and yet somehow the nearly 140 minute run time never seems to drag. The reason is the strength of the characters. They are real and they are brought to life fantastically by a terrific cast.Both Denzel Washington and Viola Davis have been nominated for Academy Awards in the Lead Role and Supporting Role respectively. Washington was truly brilliant. He was given some terrific dialogue to work with and then somehow managed to make it even better. He was captivating in every scene and I would not be unhappy, nor surprised, to see him upset Casey Affleck and take home the award. There has been a little bit of controversy surrounding Davis' role being considered ""Supporting"". She does have a tremendous amount of screen time to be considered in that category it has to be said. For this reason she is going to take home the award with out any trouble. No one playing a genuine supporting role could ever compete with the amount Davis has to be work with here. That category is an absolute shambles almost every year and needs to be sorted out.I really enjoyed 'Fences'. There probably wasn't enough to it for me to ever watch again, but it's a film that I'm happy I got to see. Simplicity can be a films biggest strength, or its biggest weakness depending on how it is utilised. For 'Fences' it was a strength. A pleasurable watch."

Emotions run high on many occasions and certain scenes are riveting.The thing about Fences, though, is that it just doesn't add up to much in the end. Characters seem to just wander in and out of the frame and the cramped feel of the film (adapted from a stage play) doesn't help the cause.Simply put, I felt like Fences was more a series of conversations (some heated, some humorous, etc.) than a fully formed film. The acting will get some awards in all likelihood, and perhaps deservedly so, but the movie itself doesn't live up to the break."
