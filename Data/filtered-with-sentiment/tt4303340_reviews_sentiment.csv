" One of the most underrated of movies in recent years.
",0.0,0.957,2020-10-14 00:00:00,9,"I Am Not a Serial Killer might just be one of the most underrated movies in recent years. Nobody talks about this movie, and that's a real shame.Going in blind is the best way to experience this movie. And that can either lead to a great watch or seriously disappointing one, depending on how you feel about the unexpected turns the story takes.I, of course, loved the twists and turns. What at first seemed like a simple psychological thriller turned out to be something completely different.I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen it. Give it a watch and judge for yourselves. I definitely don't regret doing that. It's pretty crazy."
" It's got Christopher Lloyd in it. That's all you need to know.
",0.0,0.9093,2020-09-29 00:00:00,8,"A few decades back, I saw a stage production of King Lear starring F. Murray Abraham at the American Repertory Theater in Boston. Now, Abraham is no slouch of an actor, and his Lear was brilliant, but Christopher Lloyd happened to be in residence that season, and had a bit part as one of the daughters' servants. Lloyd, having about two minutes as about as many lines completely stole the stage from Abraham. From F. Murray Abraham. Salieri himself! (Earlier that season, Lloyd had played the lead in Moliere's The Miser. Wish I'd seen it.)Anyway, I don't think I've ever seen Mr. Lloyd turn in a bad performance, and his presence in this film is a big part of the reason I wanted to watch it. He turns in an interestingly understated performance as the neighbor, Mr. Crowley, and assumes greater and greater significance as the film progresses.Lloyd finds a worthy partner in young Max Records, who gives a subtle and believable performance as John, sociopath struggling to keep his darker impulses in check. The character is written with depth and humor. Rarely do we get to see a self-aware sociopath, or one who isn't completely narcissistic. The fact that he doesn't feel for people causes him pain, and there is an element of irony in the fact that the monster truly loved someone, and John can't.I only have one beef with this movie. The age of cell phones has changed certain things, and horror directors stumble when they forget that. In the scene where John, wearing his panda ski mask confronts Crowley in the act of killing. For some reason John does not do the thing that anyone his age would do without even a conscious thought. He entirely fails to whip out his phone and take a picture. That simple act would have changed the entire film. Possibly for the worse, but it's hard for me to imagine someone under the age of 30 who wouldn't do that instantly.I did not read the book or any synopses of the film, so the ending was cool and completely unexpected to me.This movie is fun, entertaining, well made, well acted and a lot of fun to watch. It's a little gory but not so much that it makes the movie especially difficult to watch."
" Amazing movie. I'm a fan of the books.
",0.7269,0.9905,2020-09-20 00:00:00,10,"I would very much like you to continue the books. Next to ""Mr Monster"", ""I don't want to Kill you"" ... and so on. I love this Dans Wells series. It is very good. I'm not a serial killer with Max Records like John Cleaver was good. The performance was satisfactory for me. The plot is incredible and the evolution of the character even more. I would very much like you to continue. Anyway, it's a great movie and a great Dan Wells series."

" Great Start, Terrible Overall.
",0.25,0.664,2020-04-26 00:00:00,3,"I don't know why this movie had high ratings. The beginning of the plot was interesting, and I wanted more. However, all there is really is some talking, filler, a few more whatever kills, and a dumb ending. I was really hoping for a great serial killer movie, but walked away with some super natural nonsense."
" Onyx in a bag full of quartz. Original gem.
",0.3182,0.7135,2020-03-18 00:00:00,7,"Sometimes I feel like I've gone through all of the good movies (especially so with horror), and I find myself taking chances on anything out of desperation. 95 out of 100 of these dvds deserve to be burned instead of mailed back, just out of public concern. This isn't one of those. What a good film! Feels like old school horror. Not so heavily CGI'd that it feels like a Windows screensaver. It uses effects sparingly and carefully, relying on tension and pace to whip up the dread. Also nice seeing something that's not formulaic, for once I couldn't predict the story. The cinematography is a pleasant mix of throwback and contemporary. The town used as the setting and the way the camera explores and films it is incredible, and makes this a fully realized and believable environment.
The cast couldn't be improved upon. Max Records is great in this film. A gifted young actor, you feel like you're discovering secrets and murders alongside him. We are interested. We are dialed in. He is believable, playing someone who's supposedly incapable of empathy, going from a detached investigator to fully invested and concerned had to be a tightrope and he walks it well.
Now onto Christopher Lloyd. If I had known he was in this movie, I would have skipped it. Not because he's a bad actor, but because I was under the misassumption that he was more or less a one trick pony. Wrong! So glad I was clueless. I feel like every role since Back to the Future has been some variation on Doc, and assumed that was his comfort zone. Now I see he's been limited or typecast one, because he's scary in this. Actually menacing. If you had told me that was possible I wouldn't have believed it.
He rocks. Max rocks. This movie rocks. Sometimes terror is the best therapist."
" Great little indy film

" Dark and Depressing
",-0.3818,-0.6508,2020-01-05 00:00:00,8,Christopher Lloyd can do no wrong. He's excellent in this. It's so slow and sinister. What on Earth is happening? I came away so very down and depressed. Be careful! Excellent film though.
" Really good movie!
",0.54,-0.7177,2019-12-31 00:00:00,8,"The only thing I could say I was surprised of was the bizarre ending... This movie dis mot let the viewer suppose un any way whatsoever that there might be some fantastic nor science fiction element in that story. The black stuff found on the crime scenes could simply have been oil or tar... Anyway, I for one absolutely did not expect the ""fantastic"" element. I think it might have been better induced little by little. For the collecting of organs simply seemed some kind of psychopatic behavior. The ""wicked devil"" nature of the killer should have been at least suggested sooner in the development of the intrigue.Other than this... It was a darn good suspense and the young actor was teally good!"
" A new career in a new town ...
",0.0,0.9429,2019-09-21 00:00:00,7,"This is a terrific story involving a supernatural killer in a small Midwestern town. The question is - who is the killer? After a couple of very effective red herrings, the truth is revealed. Up until that point, there was no hint of anything non-human, and when the alien nature is initially revealed, it is so quick, you may have to replay the moment to be sure exactly what you have seen.That covered, this is a very slow-paced feature. The long sequences in between effective set-pieces tend to drag and attention wanders. The close-knit community, often covered in a punishing blanket of snow, lends a very familial sense of isolation to proceedings, but even that isn't enough to stop the attention wandering from time to time. The finale then goes very much in the opposite direction, with some very effective scares.Among the possible killers are young John Wayne Cleaver, and septuagenarian Bill Crowley, both brilliantly played by Max Records and Christopher Lloyd respectively. These main players head an excellent cast who make their characters believable and appealing despite their very real flaws. My score is 7 out of 10."
" my notes
",0.0,0.5859,2019-07-24 00:00:00,6,Good indy horror flick. interesting and enjoyable throughout. (1 viewing)
" Brilliantly designed supernatural thriller
",0.6597,0.9657,2019-06-22 00:00:00,9,"If there was an indie chart then this would have topped it for a while. It has an unusual setup, with various characters coming from across a middle-class spectrum, but the backstories don't distract from the penultimate goal, which is a highly original plot with plenty of thrills and chills, and many unique and unexpected moments. I really liked the no nonsense central characters. It's a movie constantly on the move, and as such a great cinematographic reflection of winter in suburban country America. On my dvd this was billed as a Monster Pictures movie. I'm yet to see a bad movie from those guys, although their interpretation of 'monster' is often human. Not A Serial Killer is a bit of both. There was a real genius to the soundtrack, a strange non-eclectic mix of styles for different situations, though somehow nailing every one. There was a visual effect in the first third that started the ball rolling, one that had real shock value. The movie did try to recapture the effect of that moment in latter scenes, but wasn't brave enough to go for more obvious visual effects, using shadows and sound instead. The suspense was sustained but I missed the shock of that original moment. If there was a top ten of shock by visual effect then that first shock moment would definitely make it for me. The script was excellent, perfectly capturing a teenager's private world. Great movie, never boring, easily recommended."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",0.0,-0.9971,2019-06-07 00:00:00,2,"John Wayne Cleaver (Max Records) has some pretty dark thoughts, he even works at a funeral home. When a serial killer becomes active is his town, people are sure it's John, and he is certainly fascinated. John decides to track the killer himself, but even he's not sure if he's going to turn him in or turn him into a mentor. This film got rave reviews, proving once again that in order to be successful in this business, you need to promote what they tell you to and completely talk out of your ass. There wasn't anything good about this film, I knew that as soon as I realized Christopher Lloyd was the man John was looking for. At this point, Lloyd is so old that he can barely walk, much less be believable as a killer! Not to mention that his mumbling has gotten so bad, it's to the point where I needed to turn on the subtitles to figure out what the hell he was saying. As for his counterpart, Max Records, is just a dull kid, and serious John Wayne Cleaver? He wasn't anything special in the Sitter or Where The Wild Things Are and things haven't changed. In my wildest dreams I wouldn't have imagined that a film with Serial Killer in the title would be as boring as this film was. Not only are the actors a joke, but there is a distinct lack of blood in this movie. All these guys seem to do is talk until the shocking ending. I'll admit they got that part right, when the filmmakers said that you'd never see it coming. That's because it really comes out of nowhere and is so beyond stupid, that you won't be able to believe that anyone would actually allow it to be put on film. I've seen some bad movies, they miss the mark for all sorts of reasons, but I Am Not A Serial Killer is just terrible in every single way possible. This isn't even the type of film that's so bad that it's funny. It's so bad, that I can't believe someone actually made this or that anyone of name would agree to star in it bad."
" Spoilers Included but don't watch this movie anyway
",0.0,-0.9635,2019-05-12 00:00:00,2,"So the only reason that I even gave this movie two stars is because of what this movie could've been. So the basis of the story is that there's a kid who's a diagnosed sociopath with serial killer-esque tendencies and in his small town there's a serial killer on the loose. Now the focus throughout much of the movie is on the kid and his therapist and his family life. The movie could've gone in multiple directions: maybe the kid is the killer, maybe he solves the case being a sociopath himself Hannibal Lecter style, and somehow he would reconcile his issues with his family and his emotions etc etc. Instead, guess who the serial killer is: it's some alien monster living inside of the human body of the kid's elderly neighbor who kills so that he can take organs and make himself live longer. The movie turned into something out of Men in Black when it could've been a very interesting watch. The kid sort of reconciles his issues by killing the alien with his mom which gives them sort of a bond but it's so purely ridiculous that there's nothing powerful or emotive there. The kid witnesses a bunch of the murders in which the elderly neighbor seems to have a kind of superhuman strength which leads the audience to believe that maybe the neighbor isn't human. While watching, my friend and I were both trying to predict the ending and we kept saying ""well maybe the guy is just some alien but that would kind of make the movie stupid and a waste of time right?"" But they did it anyway. The ending was both predictable and totally outrageous. The movie started to develop the different side plots or elements of the kid's life like finding a potential romantic interest, having issues with his absentee father and his single mother, and working through counseling with his therapist. All of these different narratives were totally cast away and the movie morphed into an unfunny Men in Black that futilely attempted to be emotionally powerful."
" Surprising gem
",0.2732,-0.7351,2019-03-02 00:00:00,10,This is a fun and at times incredibly tense film from beginning to end. All the performances are spectacular especially Lloyd and the young lead who is perpetually watchable. I highly recommend this to any and all horror fans but especially fans of indie horror.
" Nice
",0.4215,-0.4165,2019-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't expecting what I got from this film.John, a teenager with homicidal thoughts and behaviors, is in therapy trying to work out his fascination with morbidity but it proves to be a challenge considering that his mother is a mortician. A local serial killer becomes active John uncovers the perpetrator's identity. He sits on this knowledge out of his own curiosity and has to come to a decision about what actions he should take. Will his homicidal mindset lead him astray or will he expose the killer?This is a clever little film. It isn't an ordinary serial killer film where we see law enforcement frantically trying to find the killer before he has an opportunity to kill again. In fact, we see very little law enforcement throughout the film. This really stays focused on John.The pace of this is slow but it helps in building characters and suspense. I thought the actors were great in this. The twist is not one that is not one that is seen in this type of film and I like that.If you are looking for something a little different check this out!"
" Pretty weird, not fully explained at the end, but fun.
",0.7351,0.9754,2018-07-02 00:00:00,5,"Definitely strange - if you like standard movies with standard genre and plots you may not enjoy this one. If you like emotional characters that you can connect with and 'average joe' dramas, you may not enjoy this one. I enjoyed it because I felt like it did a good job of taking some classic horror elements (sociopath/stalker/creepy guy) and puts subtle twists on it.
 I think they either didn't portray a sociopath very effectively or else they are saying the kid was misdiagnosed because for supposedly having no empathy he showed too much emotion and reacted in ways a person who ""doesn't care"" wouldn't. They tried to make him dark and creepy but still make you root for him. It's not very realistic, but they did a fair job of it in my opinion. The ""dark protagonist"" with a heart of gold learning how to love. Kind of slow, kind of cheesy, but they did a great job of making it creepy and making you question things - that's what I enjoyed. The ending was out of left field and absolutely not credible in any way (one of the characters who is supposed to be 'normal' just goes along with the crazy for no good reason? No closure on the origin story of the totally unbelievable antagonist?) It lost some stars there, but overall I still found it more entertaining than the average cookie-cutter show."
" Just watch this, it's surprisingly good!
",0.6588,0.9357,2018-06-10 00:00:00,8,"Wow, this movie was really a surprise! I expected a simple scifi or horror flick, but this turned out as a very stylish art-house movie. Yes, still with the surreal scifi elements in it, but these are not so much the focus of the movie, it's more about the way the main character John Wayne (excellently played by Max Records) comes to grip with the strange goings-on and with his own demons. The whole movie is very athmospheric, the icy snow-covered little town, the dark nights, the taciturn people. It all reminded me a bit of ""Let me in"". Although everything goes very slow, with few dialogue, it kept me on the edge of my chair, all the time wondering where things would go next. The acting of the whole cast is fine, but as I already said young Max Record really excells, he sure is a promise for the future!"
" I Am Not A Serial Killer was not what I expected...at all.
",0.5334,0.2248,2018-02-25 00:00:00,6,"From the very few indie films that I have seen, I should really expect the unexpected. Yet here I am, again...wondering what the heck did I just watch!? The story revolves around a teenager who is obsessed with death and murder. His hometown of Clayton is currently experiencing several deaths in which our protagonist attempts to find the culprit. So...automatically, even just by acknowledging the title, I thought this would be a character study on a psychotic teen who slowly becomes a serial killer. In which, to be fair, that concept is explored both on a subtextual and contextual level. His obsession overwhelms him which could be interpreted for any obsession. Defining the line between passion and obsession, the film utilises murder to convey this. Then...then then then...'I Am Not A Serial Killer' becomes 'I Am Under The Skin'. Quite literally. I was so adamant I knew what was going to happen, even before playing the film and yet the indie genre slaps me round the face and shouts ""no, you're wrong. Prepare yourself for this..."". Honestly, I'm not sure how to feel about this film. It's intelligent and original no doubt, but the forced abnormal plot just seemed too unusual. So unusual that I think it detracts from the ideas that the film evokes. The psychological aspects are thrown to the side line whilst the narrative focuses purely on this weird story. Is he imagining it? Is it actually happening? Whatever it is, it's hard to relate to the characters. I don't know what to say, I just didn't fully connect with this and couldn't jump onboard. Christopher Lloyd was great as usual, glad he got a decent amount of screen time. The direction was solid all round, really liked the smudges and dirt on the camera lens in certain shots. The ending wasn't powerful or clever. I mean...it concludes fine, but I wanted it to be more psychologically stimulating. It just wasn't. In the end, this was a so-so affair. I liked the technical aspects but disliked the surreal plot to illustrate psychotic behaviour."
" Some originality to be found in this serial killer flick played out in a minor key
",-0.4404,0.7959,2017-11-29 00:00:00,6,"A teenager who works at an undertakers with his family, has dark obsessions with death as well as displaying sociopathic tendencies. When he discovers that one of his elderly neighbours is a serial killer responsible for a recent spare of violent murders, its sets off confusing dilemmas within him.I Am Not a Serial Killer is certainly a film which approaches fairly typical material in a left-of-centre manner. Like seems to be the current vogue, of which I am not entirely keen on I have to say, it goes for a tone of downbeat realism. This allows the drama of the story to be played out with some seriousness, helped quite a bit by a strong acting performance from Max Records in the central role and with good support from the rest of the cast, including some fine work from Christopher Lloyd as the killer. Consequently, this qualifies more as a dramatic psychological thriller that eventually goes full-on into horror territory, as opposed to a traditionally suspenseful serial killer film. It does have to be said though, that the ending in which events take a turn into creature feature territory definitely had me surprised. It was an ending which I am guessing may be a little divisive with audiences but I certainly appreciated its oddball unpredictableness. The movie as a whole is very deliberately paced and with its wintry north Midwest setting it has a pretty sustained gloominess which, while it worked within the framework of the story it was telling, definitely didn't accentuate its entertainment value for me I have to admit. So I have mixed feelings overall about this one, as while I found it to suffer a bit from the recent cinematic trend for the downbeat, I also recognise that it did have a few unusual ideas up its sleeve as well."

",-0.4767,0.797,2017-09-03 00:00:00,1,"I never review any films but I felt compelled to after having watched this absolute trash. I honestly have no idea why it has so many good reviews, this film is so inconsistent. The main character is diagnosed as being a sociopath yet he cares for everyone?!?! 90% of the film is filler, none of the scenes push the story forward, a plot didn't seem to exist. An hour into the film I checked to see how long it had been on for, I was gobsmacked it had only been on for 60 minutes, It felt like days had passed. The film was slow and cumbersome, the dialogue was ineffective and didn't contribute to the story line most of the time. I won't put any spoilers in, the main spoiler of the film is the fact it has spoilt my Sunday afternoon, I'm hungover and now I'm angry too. Please don't watch this film, you will just end up like me, bitter, twisted and disappointed."
" Interesting in parts but not entirely successful as a whole
",-0.5549,-0.939,2017-09-02 00:00:00,5,"In the small mid-western town of Clayton County, a serial killer is running rampant and one particular young man John Cleaver (Max Records) becomes interested in the case and starts to use his own skills to track down the killer. When he eventually discovers who the killer is he finds himself on a dangerous collision course with the serial killer in what becomes a perilous battle-of-wits...The main draw with this film (at least in its early stages) is Max Records; he plays a fairly interesting character even if he falls into the usual cliché of being the 'weird kid at high school.' He's a sociopathic kid with obsessive tendencies (in his case he is obsessed with serial killers and the inner workings of their minds). The foundations of the story are promising, but the actual results here are rather meagre; given the way the story began to develop I was really hoping for a good battle-of-wits or cat and mouse game between John and our serial killer, but it never really manifests itself in this manner and the film never becomes as exciting or tense as it could have been.I Am Not A Serial Killer has supernatural undercurrents to it's theme in respect of the serial killer, but the whole basis of this story is rather flimsy and poorly explained; I understand that he's been possessed or is perhaps a ghost of some description, but how did all this come about? Also why was his desire to kill subdued for such a long time? Has he been hibernating? His face is also displayed on the news on a regular occurrence, but no-one recognises him?? Yes I know he's a lot older, but you'd still think that someone would recognise him...One other thing that I noticed was in the scene where John is in the phone box talking to the serial killer there is lots of snow all over the place - yet in the subsequent scene when the serial killer chases him for about 100 yards all of the snow seems to disappear, then in the next scene there's snow everywhere?? I presume that the explanation for this is that it was filmed over several months and at different times of the year, but filmmakers really should check their editing and continuity as errors like this are glaringly obvious and look rather amateurish.The strong links with this film are Max Records who plays the sociopathic odd kid to near perfection and Christopher Lloyd who is also excellent in his respective role and is both creepy and unnerving - although he does seem to mumble some of his dialogue at times making it difficult to decipher what he's saying. The other players do OK with what they have to work with, but this picture belongs to Max Records and Christopher Lloyd.I was originally going to rate the film with a 6 out of 10 because on the whole I found it quite enjoyable, but it lost a star for its rather dumb ending which could perhaps be explained by its supernatural overtones, but it was silly and ridiculous and the end result was something that was more funny than scary. It has some interesting elements, but it also has a lot working against it resulting in a split-decision verdict from this reviewer."
" If Stranger things, the Void, and Southbound had a Love Child.
",0.6369,0.9861,2017-08-07 00:00:00,9,"Slow paced ? No ! It's called great character development and great story which you want more of ! Amazing script, acting and excellent executed! Christopher Lloyd is fantastic in this role, and it's a joy to see him act out his role. The movie itself has an late 80s early 90s aura around it, which is great.The soundtrack, atmosphere and the way the movie was filmed felt authentic and real and that combined with everything else just made this movie so awesome. I really can't compare it to anything, but I felt like if the movie Southbound, The Void and the TV show Stranger Things would have a love child it would be named I am not a series killer. When Lloyd quoted William Blake it gave me goosebumps and a chill down my spine. A must watch ! 9/10 for an amazing horror, thriller, drama !"
" ""I'd do anything for love"" says the murderer
",-0.1027,0.9883,2017-07-08 00:00:00,7,"Wow, i didn't see that coming. Nice twist at the ending, i really didn't expect it. At first I thought this was the same kind of mediocre murder movie with a lot of police involved, but i was wrong. It was kind of bored in the beginning, started with daily life of a teenager whom diagnosed with a mental-illness. The story tried to lead us to think the major role was a sociopath, and that he was troubled. And he also thought so. Even though i didn't think he was. I mean, he just had a big interest about a story of homicide. It was perhaps rare among his teenage friends, but it was still normal. He just liked to play detective.The pace is quite slow, the story was not so tense even when there was a homicide happened, but it kept me watching the movie. Maybe i was captivated with the acting, and i believed that something was going to happen. It was not brutal and scary, and we finally know he was not crazy and it sum up everything : he wasn't the killer. I'm not disappointed though, even it seems like an underrated indie movie. I think this movie needs a chance."
" Odd yet compelling little indie
",-0.1027,0.8233,2017-07-05 00:00:00,6,"Last year, Netflix unleashed one of its bigger hits to date - the nostalgic, creepy and ridiculously entertaining Stranger Things. Set in the 1980s, the show quickly garnered a legion of fans old enough to have grown up on the blockbuster classics of Steven Spielberg, as well as attracting younger viewers drawn to its mystery and lovable characters. While Stranger Things itself may have been influenced by J.J. Abrams' throwback Super 8, the show's success can certainly be felt throughout cinema. One such film is Billy O'Brien's I Am Not a Serial Killer, adapted from Dan Wells' young adult novel of the same name, which manages to hide its low budget roots incredibly well and deliver an interesting character study with a supernatural edge.Teenager John Wayne Cleaver (Max Records) shows all the signs of being a future serial killer. He is well aware that his sinister thoughts and general disdain for humanity do not bode well, and openly tells his therapist so. In order to ensure that he doesn't commit a terrible act he cannot take back, John follows a strict set of rules, including responding to abuse by paying a compliment. It hasn't prevented him from developing a reputation as a freak among his fellow students in high school, but he does enjoy an easy-going friendship with his elderly neighbour, Mr. Crowley (Christopher Lloyd). In his spare time, John helps out his mother (Laura Fraser) with the family funeral home business, where he gets to stare with intense curiosity at the cadavers being readied for embalming. When the town is hit by an organ- stealing murderer, John uses his encyclopaedic knowledge of serial killers to carry out his own investigation.It's to O'Brien's credit that he has managed to sculpt such an impressive-looking piece out of such a modest budget. It has a grungy, 90s aesthetic with a soundtrack including the likes of Donovan and Norman Greenbaum, but with the way it explores its dark subject matter and troubled protagonist, also feels contemporary. The less known about the film the better, as what little I had heard about it before going in led me to believe that I would be getting a serious study of a young sociopath, but this is only half of the story. The young Records, last seen in 2009's Where the Wild Things Are as an eleven year-old, plays the psycho with a heart of gold with a weirdly endearing blend of creepiness and fragility, and Lloyd gives one of his career-best as one of John's prime suspects. It has its flaws, and your enjoyment of the film may depend on how much genre-mixing you can stomach, but this is an odd yet compelling little indie."

But it was very different, especially at each stage when development takes a new facet. Totally unexpected, the character played by Christopher Lloyd. I had some doubt, but my guesses were wrong on the basis of genre. That was the best part of this film with a kind of dark comedy atmosphere.Based on the first book in the trilogy of the same name. An Irish- British psychological-thriller. Kind of like a B movie, but much better production quality. It has been weeks that I saw this film, but only now I'm reviewing it, yet it still feels like I saw it yesterday, despite I've seen dozens of films in between. It's going to be just a cult-film, not cult-classic.Because of being a non-Hollywood film, the concept had worked for me. It's about a teenager in a small town who keep witnesses strange disappearance of people. Knowing what's going on, he could not convince others about it. So he had to deal with it all by himself and how the tale ends come with a little twist. A good film, at least it would be for a few people, particularly those who like small scale suspense-thriller.5/10"
" Small Town Thriller, Chiller with some fine performances.
",0.296,0.8106,2017-05-11 00:00:00,6,"As winter bites in a small town in Minnesota we meet a young lad with homicidal thoughts. His mom is a school teacher and she arranges for him to see a counsellor who is trying to stop him acting on the thoughts that are emanating from 'the dark side'.Round about the same time people start to turn up dead. They are not just dead however, as that would not be spooky enough. No they are all missing certain parts of their, erstwhile, mortal coils and the police are devoid of clues as to what is happening under their very, bloodied, noses – metaphorically speaking of course.Now this is a film that is basically an Irish effort but has been made in the US as its story clearly works a lot better in that setting. The acting is all great but hats off to Christopher Lloyd ('Back to the future' trilogy) as Mr Crowley who can manage octogenarian frail and threateningly evil all in the same scene. There is a fair bit of blood letting and scenes of an autopsy nature so best to avoid a light supper whilst viewing. The acting is all very good indeed and the ending may not be to everyone's taste but the clues are sprinkled throughout and so I found it more than OK. So for a bit of blood spatter violence and a whole ton of vengeance this may be one for you."
" Surprisingly Good

We enjoyed this."
" I Was a Teenage Dexter
",0.0,-0.9762,2017-04-12 00:00:00,6,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by this little indie horror/ thriller/offbeat combo. At first very cynical that this was a plot and a character that I was going to hate, I found myself hooked by both the plot and the character by the time the move resolves.Our ""hero"" is a teenage sociopath. His father left when he was young and he lives with his mom and (I think) her lesbian lover (never clear) in their family funeral parlor. All of it has combined to make him an emotionless weird kid, picked on at school and mostly isolated. When we first meet him, I was sure he would annoy the heck out of me. He's basically a ripoff of Dexter, right down to a code of rules he follows to make sure that he ""stays good"". He's obsessed with serial killers, mouths off to bullies, and mostly has all the traits that Hollywood loves to imbue in the weird kid role in their movies.His proximity to death, in the funeral parlor, brings him very close to a series of local murders, which begin to entangle the hero more and more. We meet Christopher Lloyd, his neighbor, who first seems like the nice old guy next door, but we start realizing that he may have quite a lot to do with the deaths in the town and, even more, may be more than meets the eye. From there, the movie takes a good turn, slowing developing a tense, tight plot line that ratchets up the suspense and deftly introduces many elements. At its' very core, it's a thriller, with twists and turns and plenty of suspense. There is a lot of horror, as well, with violent, grisly murders. There is an offbeat sense of humor to the whole movie, especially from our teenage hero. We even get some magic realism, or modern folklore, as the real truth of what the murderer really is plays with many aspects of old folklore.This movie could have been a disaster in the wrong hands. The kid could have come off as completely annoying. The low budget effects may have thrown everything off the rails. The odd sense of playful gallows humor could have prevented the movie from gathering any suspense. But this is one of those rare indie films that gets most everything right. Is it ground breaking? No, certainly not, but it's an entertaining movie that will appease horror fans and anyone looking for something a little different."
" ""I Am Not A Serial Killer"" - Is a very good little horror-suspense movie
",0.7674,0.9945,2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,"My opinion---""I Am Not Serial Killer"" is a good little suspense horror film by Billy O'Brien, based on the same novel by Dan Wells (2009). This film takes place on a slow rhythm wanted by the director to give a special atmosphere to the film. The film will show you the world of this young man: John Wayne Cleaver (Max Records) who often shoots in the universe of the morgue where his mother works as a forensic scientist, it's just to tell you the good idea of ​​the film . The film will give even more desire to see it as time passes, the atmosphere will be even more palpable, ending with beautiful scenes that will complement and reinforce the idea of ​​the film, Maybe The slow way of the film can disturb some, but in the end you will understand that this film was really worth seeing. ""Max Records"" plays perfectly his role of John Wayne Cleaver and it is still a plus for the film. The final scene is truly magnificent to see with superb effects. In conclusion: the film is very good despite its slow rate wanted, it is also very well realized and performed, it is ultimately a very good film of its kind I advise you."

" Great

The best from the movie would be that, his performance. They have some good effects too (I wasn't as fond of the villain's quality but it worked out)"
" If Only..
",0.0,0.8618,2017-02-19 00:00:00,6,"It is such a tragedy when a film is so well done and then BAM- it goes to hell at the end. Max Records gives a fantastic performance of a teenager whose dark impulses frighten those around him because they do not understand the mindset of someone different. He is diagnosed as a sociopath from one of the most unethical doctors on film. He lacks empathy and it affects his life significantly. Despite his difficulty expressing or understanding empathy, he is drawn to help an elderly man next door (a great Christopher Lloyd) with secrets of his own. In the meantime, people are dying. This movie went so many interesting places and I loved some of the territory I could identify with. The performances were also top- notch. And then BAM- the ending takes all the best parts of the script and shreds them and wastes so much of the potential of this story. I enjoyed everything until the last ten minutes so much that I still had to give it a 6. It is worth the watch for how good it was and what it could have been with an ending grounded in reality. I understand that it is based on a book- but the book should have had a different ending too if it resembles this story the same way."
" Not as good as Dan Wells book, simply because you can't see into their minds as much.
",-0.1043,-0.9708,2017-01-28 00:00:00,7,"I read the first three books in the John Cleaver series by Dan Wells, and really enjoyed them. I didn't realize there are six until I started doing a bit of research for this review. I will definitely be checking them out.This movie was close to the first book, but there were four big differences. In the book you were able to read more about what was going on in John's mind. While Max Records did a great job showing emotions (or non-emotions) with his face, to me it was still lacking because we couldn't know all that he was thinking.The next was with Brooke. In the book John is obsessed with her, in such a way that it is very creepy and you actually think he will kill her. But in the movie, it seemed more like Brooke was obsessed with John. The scene where he is watching her through the window just didn't have the same effect that it did in the book.Next, and it's been awhile since I read the book, but I seem to remember that his mom was more understanding of him and his tendencies. In the movie when the psychiatrist tells her, she freaks out and doesn't want him down in the embalming room with her any more. I don't remember her doing this in the book, and she actually had him join her because she knew it was a way for him to temper some of his urges.And the last part that was really different was how the book ended. It was actually more climatic than in the movie. The killer who was violently fighting for his life in the book, just kind of lost all his fight in the movie.But even with these differences you should still watch this one, but maybe read the book afterwards so you get more out of it."
" Dead on arrival......
",-0.6486,-0.8646,2017-01-28 00:00:00,4,"In spite of its good casting choices, I Am Not A Serial Killer, fails to impress.This is a ""dead on arrival"", B grade horror thriller, that appropriately starts and ends in a morgue. Its a film that's short on both horror and thrills. Its pacing is far, far too languid to really hold even the most patient of viewers attention. This is exacerbated by a rather gloomy, austere atmosphere that permeates the whole film, further sucking it dry of any kind of vitality and energy. The casting choices are good and for a low budget flick the acting is for the most part, pretty decent. Its simply a shame the script for this film was not more energetic, infused with pace, dread and a sense of foreboding.All key ingredients in any decent scare fest.Four out of ten from me."
" Silly at Times but Still Effective Low-Budget Try at ""Out of the Box""

The Pacing is Slow but not to a Detriment. The Acting all around is Professional and the Old War Horse Christopher Lloyd Steal the Show (no surprise) given the Juicy Role.There are some Surprises and it Stuns now and then to Keep Things Moving.

" Gritty/disturbing + silly young adult tale = truly ridiculous
",0.128,-0.971,2017-01-23 00:00:00,3,"""I Am Not a Serial Killer"" is a strange stab at a young adult novel style treatment of gritty true crime, psychological thriller stories, which makes the ill-judged leap, far too late, into total supernatural fantasy. It tries to be all serious and morbid – at least until the ending – but is really just another in the scores of teen fiction made into film with a super-powered adolescent. Jut in this case, the superpower is a personality disorder.John is a teenage boy who has been ""diagnosed"" with antisocial personality disorder by his psychologist, despite the fact that, as non-medical doctors, psychologists cannot diagnose people with anything: that's a psychiatrist's job. He follows rules he has set himself to prevent him from ever harming anybody, though of course, if he were really a sociopath, he would have no use for such ""rules"". The movie never explains why this particular character is so committed to not hurting anyone; we're supposed to take it as a matter of course.This is unlikely enough, but John also works at his family's funeral home. He's a mortician who knows the ins and outs of embalming and dressing the dead for burial. I'm fairly certain it is illegal for someone to work as a mortician without training and a license, which John could not have as he is only a teenager. Come to that, I'm also fairly certain someone too young to buy a packet of cigarettes would not be legally allowed to scrub your dead grandmother's naked body, and replace her blood with embalming fluid.The hits just keep on coming, as John finds his own town apparently harbouring a serial killer. Guess who finds out the killer's identity, after the police are singularly unable to? This is all the stuff of teen fiction: the young may not notice how far-fetched all these coincidences and details are. But the handling of the material also tries to be gritty and disturbing, which is undercut by the silliness of it.""I Am Not a Serial Killer"" is, ultimately, a story which tries to be two different things and succeeds at neither. For a movie that seems to be trying so hard to be serious and disturbing, the ending has to be seen to be believed. You'd laugh if the one and a half hour beforehand hadn't so resolutely sucked the jollity out of you."
" A film with both heart and style
",0.0,0.98,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Reminiscent of the work of Cronenberg, particularly his pre- 2000's era, I Am Not a Serial Killer was a much better watch than I had expected. As some have pointed out, it is a slow burner, but I think that's necessary to give us insight and character development. At it's core, IANASK is a character study of our protagonist, John Cleaver. Is John Cleaver destined to be a serial killer? Is he a sociopath? Is he good, is he evil? These are the questions we find ourselves asking time and time again throughout the film as his words and actions contradict themselves and each other over and over. John Cleaver is a teenager and with all of the issues that face any normal teenager he also has to deal with some extremely difficult and strange problems. He is misunderstood, he doesn't know how to express himself, he is unsure of his feelings and his identity. If this movie had been gutted of the sci-fi aspect I am perfectly confident that this would have been a wonderful quality drama focusing on John's school and home life and how he deals with his father's absence and his homicidal ideations. That being said, I think the film works just fine as it is- really much better than it sounds on paper. IANASK has an organic feel in it's material that is hard to find and much sought after by many cinephiles, and that is the artistic vision of its creator. Not having seen any of O'Brien's other films I can't tell you if this elusive vision is that of the director or moreso of the source material, the novel by Dan Wells that it was based on; or, of course, a perfect marriage of the two. What I can tell you is that this film is not only fresh and interesting in way of the story but also the cinematography, shot beautifully on 16mm film, which gives the film a much more stately and artistic feel than this sort of material would have easily afforded shot digitally with the increasingly common voyeuristic hand-held style. All in all IANASK is a perfect example of modern film that still has heart, soul, and style; and as such it is a breath of fresh air in today's Hollywood climate."
" This is how you do it.
",0.0,0.9639,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"This is it. The creepiest killer persona I've seen in a while -- and I've only recently come out of an insane horror-binge that spanned over the length of a couple of months. Laurels to Mr. Lloyd for his incredibly chilly performance that framed so eloquently a very competent ensemble without dominating with experience; barring, of course, his grand ""solo"" which was just... remarkable.Now, if I cared about the brackets of cinematic categories, I would class this movie as ""uncategorizable"" for it makes a run through so many genres, it ultimately brakes all the boundaries and uses the shards to create a stunning patchwork quilt of peculiar unity.Providing us with a fresh outlook on a topic old but favorite, the movie, on the whole, is capable of qualitatively standing alone on the merits of its technical points, however, a few pacing issues aside, we are also graced with effective build-up and organic plot progression, making this subtle endeavor an unmissable filmic underdog."
" A great indie horror that deserves way more recognition
",0.1027,0.8023,2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"If your thing is jumpscares galore or ""made from the producers of most of the popular horror films this season"" don't watch this movie. With that said...As a huge horror movie fanatic, from psychological and paranormal to the gory sides of it, I've seen so many that I've grown tired of the modern cash-grabs. This is where ""I am not a serial killer"" separates itself from the rest. Now, I haven't read the book, so I can't judge it based on its adaptation. However, as a standalone indie movie it surpassed all my expectations. For one, the setting isn't typically what you'd expect from a horror movie. Yes, a small town and a troubled teen, but John Wayne Cleaver (the teen), wasn't typical either. We follow a kid who has sociopathic tendencies, and the film even goes to the extent of calling him A sociopath. Yes, we've seen anti-heroes, psychopaths and sociopaths as protagonists fighting evil, but this film simply does it in, perhaps, a more honest approach. He's struggling with himself, with his violent urges and anti-social behavior, and in a way he finds escape through fighting the greater evil. And not to get too personal here, but to an extent I related to the main character. The antagonist doesn't fall in any particular category of famous horror movie villains, but it is maybe because of that, that he fit the story. The ending gave a great insight as well to his actions and his own story and we might feel, in a way, empathetic to his reasons. The supporting characters were really nicely written as well, I think.I'm not saying this is a perfect horror movie, *cough* the CGI *cough* but I honestly don't think it'd be fair to compare it to the usual things we get these days. Whereas not only horror movies, but movies of any genre focus more on the CGI, this movie has a better developed story line, better structured characters and an intriguing calm winter aesthetic about it. It is much slower paced than regular horror flicks out there, but it really deserves a watch.Having said all this, my intention isn't to undermine popular modern horror movies, I actually quite enjoyed ""The Conjuring 2"", instead to hopefully provoke people who want an aesthetically pleasing horror to watch ""I am not a serial killer"".PS: I'm not sure if John Wayne Cleaver is named after John Wayne Gacy, but that'd be an interesting choice if it were true."
" The Festival Darling Hits Netflix!
",0.807,0.9912,2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"It's 2017, and even though I Am Not a Serial Killer was released way back in march of last year, it has recently been added to Netflix thus giving the movie it's most widespread accessibility. I Am Not a Serial Killer has been on my radar since that South By Southwest Film Festival screening and I have only heard good things so when I saw it was headed to Netflix I was quite excited. It has been a while since I have seen a real solid horror movie, actually probably since I saw It Follows in 2015. While it's not really fair to compare the two movies, they do have some similarities.The basics of I Am Not a Serial Killer are pretty basic. The appropriately named John Wayne Cleaver is our main character, a teenager who has some issues that most normal heroes don't have, he is a diagnosed sociopath. John struggles with the idea that he will become a serial killer, so he comes up with a set of rules to control himself when he starts to think about indulging his impulses. He is good at controlling himself with the help of his therapist, and oddly enough working in the mortuary that his mother owns and operates. The small nondescript mid-western town that John lives in has been plagued by some rather grizzly murders and John feels that he can figure out who has been committing these crimes, either from a connection to the killer or possibly something deeper.I Am Not a Serial Killer is a slow moving affair. This is not necessarily a bad thing, the movie takes it's time setting up relationships between characters and giving some solid character development that is usually glossed over or explained away with boring exposition. The movie lets the actors show and not tell, which even though it is one of the biggest rules in film making is often forgotten by horror movies. Max Records who plays John Wayne Cleaver does a great job of getting his character into the gray area that seems so difficult to achieve. John is not only a flawed person because of his sociopath, but he is also a kid, he does not always make the right choice or he may not always be quick with a line. He feels like a real high school student, with a bit of a twist.The pacing of the movie is not the only thing that lends a hand to separate the tone from most other serial killer movies. I Am Not a Serial Killer makes efforts to not be a cookie cutter low budget horror movie, because it's really not. It blends genres quite well I think but also relies on its story and tone to drive the emotion, rather than well timed musical cues and immense gore. There are no jump scares here, which I can appreciate. Jump scares to me are like hot sauce, when used sparingly the effect is much more enjoyable, but when overused the whole thing is ruined. Don't necessarily expect to be given nightmares by I Am Not a Serial Killer, it may just keep you up at night with some self reflection.While I Am Not a Serial Killer does not stand up to The Babadook or It Follows, it is certainly a good movie and like those other two (which I believe are the two best horror movies I have seen in the last few years) it avoids being a clone of all the mass produced horror movies that make 200x their budget because every guy hopes this will finally be the scary movie that will make that girl he likes jump into his arms for protection. If you come into it looking for more of a good movie rather than a scary or bone chilling one you should be good. Enjoy the creepiness of the atmosphere and the well told story, and the girl you are trying to impress with how tough you are during scary movies may just appreciate your taste in movies a bit more."
" Had Potential. Love the Set-Up.
",0.6369,0.9707,2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"""I Am Not A Serial Killer"" is a fresh, lower-budget thriller that has its share of positive traits.The film sets-up nicely. The characters are well-established and interesting. There are a few moments that really have some nice shots and atmosphere early. The small-town in the winter aspect adds a claustrophobic, eerie feel, and there's some scoring that's commendable to boot.THe film also has some great scenes like when our protagonist confronts the school bully at a Halloween dance. It's probably the highlight of the film for me. The first 45 minutes here is really strong. It was headed to cult-status and my ""b Movie Marathon Lists"", but after rounding-up it may only make the latter, and not by much if it does.Down the stretch the film has some writing lapses and looses a little juice. The supernatural aspect should have been scrapped from the start, and has little to no impact late when it's right in your face. If the film would have taken the more realistic approach and had a bit more thrill in terms of antagonist/protagonist, it could have really soared. The potential here was immense, but the finished product is a bit dodgy. Marginal recommendation. 60/100You might like this if you liked: It Follows(better), Disturbia(slightly better, but much bigger budget), or I Saw the Devil(better)."
