" A great cast wasted - they deserve better
",0.5859,0.7254,2021-03-16 00:00:00,6,"Because of the cast and the truth of the story, I have watched this film several times, hoping I will appreciate it more. Acting was great, achieving the reality of the Soviet ambience was incredible. But the editing ruined this film. It jumps from scene to scene with little continuity. Such a same. Get the film and cut and edit for a good film, please"
" So underrated
",0.0,-0.9437,2021-03-05 00:00:00,9,"It is a great movie actually. Because it shows how terrible was that time in USSR. The overall feeling of state/gov terror and oppression, the constant pressure of state in everyone's private life, even glimpses of political correctness BS from that time. That's how it was, a post-apocalyptic Orwell's 1984-like world. The social dynamics, the fear, human interactions - everything is spot on.
It's sad that this movie is considered not so good in America. We like all kind of fantastic/kindergarten level BS but a well-made, thoughtful and dire warning like this movie is not liked, not ""understood"" and completely disregarded. And we go along and think that this could not happen in America, while it's actually in the making :("

" Tom Hardy at his best!
",0.8016,0.9881,2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"I had never heard of this movie until I came across it on Tubi. I'm a huge Hardy fan, so I had to check it out. It really is a good movie. The plot is a little complicated, but well worth the effort. The hunt for the serial killer is not really the main point of the movie. It's a study of life in Russia after WWII, emphasizing the personal conflict of good men being forced to do things that violate their conscience. It's also a love story of a man who is totally in love with his wife, but she is not as enraptured with him. The plot plays out such that the killer is stopped, the man's reputation is restored, and the wife discovers how good the man is that she's married to, and they have a chance to redeem themselves and live a good and purposeful life together. It is a very dark & rough movie to watch as the characters fight for survival and track the killer down. But I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it. Tom Hardy is the best actor around today, and the supporting cast is great."
" Not good
",-0.3412,0.4939,2021-01-30 00:00:00,4,"I just want to say one thing, watch Citizen X (1995) instead, that's the good one."
" Better watch Citizen X
",0.4404,-0.9755,2021-01-30 00:00:00,6,"Child 44 is to much Hollywood, to much dramatized with too much cliches.
The 'actual story' about the murders came much too short and obviously only there to glue together the dramatization.
So everything we know from other movies all too well:

" Somehow nothing really fits
",0.0,-0.8436,2020-11-25 00:00:00,5,"I don't know why a lot of things in this film don't fit together. A mass murder story against the background of Stalinist terror remains a mass murder story at first. The motives of the perpetrator are quickly dealt with, mainly it is about Tom Hardy's character, who lives in permanent danger of being killed by government powers, although he is actually part of them. This conflict could be dealt with more strongly, because with Hardy an outstanding actor is at work here who can get the last word out of his characters. Director Espinosa has chosen to portray him as a reserved and sensitive man, who, however, blows his fuses in crucial situations. Noomi Rapace as his wife is the reliable performer as we know her. She has some remarkable overtones, but tends not to vary her roles strongly enough. And Gary Oldman doesn't have a shine for me anymore. His characters are now highly predictable and bore me. The overall result of this film is ambivalent for me, as I find the narrative style too slow at times, the duration too long and also the characters not well enough developed."
" READ THE BOOK

Perfect casting, proper sets and environments belongs to 40-50 decades, old steam engine railways and decent view of old military officers and their politics, those are positive points as me. Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace both did their best to live their roles. Gary Oldman impressed in his small role. One thing is also admirable as me that the end is very good and inspirable to us. I did not think such a end. It is a good twist to such good movie. Worth to watch this movie. Do not miss."

" Some Weak Points At The Start... But Stay With It, It's Worth It...
",0.1027,0.9747,2020-09-17 00:00:00,7,"My Ratings:
Story 1.50 : Direction 1.25 : Pace 1.25 : Acting 1.50 : Entertaining 1.25
Total 6.75 out of 10.00This is an enlightening story in many ways. I just think it was a shame Richard Price, who adapted the Tom Smith novel, didn't structure it better. It's too straight forward and casual. The first quarter of the story, which charts Leo Demidov's youth and acceptance into the Russian MGB (Ministry Of State Security) has very little feeling. This is a bad thing as it stops the audience from relating to him. Because of this, you don't become emotionally anchored to his future until the last third of the film. This further distances us from the story and the film.By the end though, you have a much clearer vision of the man and his motives. However, this would have been a much better film had we been given that insight, even if it were only hinted at, earlier.What stands out in the story most is Mother Russia and the Government and their ideals. This is not a happy country. It is bleak and life is hard. So the regime spins their own truths to match what they want their people to believe. Therefore, there is no murder in paradise. It's a Western weakness. In turn, this new truth, helps the serial killer hide as all his kills are solved as accidents.At the same time, the MGB are hunting out subversives and spies. Which opens up new troubles for Leo and his wife. We start to get a true image of Leo at this point forward.The confrontation between Leo and the killer is a little shakey. Some of the things the killer tells Leo about knowing him don't ring true. We never get to know if he did know him or not. Or if he was generalising. It's a flimsy and insufficient ending.The straight forward way the story is told is mirrored in the direction and is detrimental to keeping the audience's attention. I like to immerse myself in the story and the movie. I couldn't fully do that with this film. Daniel Espinosa does a good, though pedestrian, job of directing. There are plenty of times when pace could have been altered to create tension and atmosphere. Even some diverse camera angles and lighting techniques would have added strength and interest. The simple point and shoot are okay, though it does very little to help the viewer to the end of the story.Luckily the acting is top-notch. And all of the actors and actresses are superb in their roles, eve Paddy Considine nearly carries off the accent till the end. I am a fan of all the actors in this movie, though I have to say Considine does have trouble with accents. But hey, at least he tries. Charles Dance sounds exactly like... Charles Dance. Tom Hardy goes from strength to strength and shows how good he is at character acting. This is one actor I could always watch.All of that said, this is worth one watch, at the least. It's not the best mystery thriller but it does open your eyes to how the Soviet Union used to be.Come over and see where Child 44 ranked on my The Game Is Afoot list.Take Care and Stay Well."
" A very boring film.
",-0.3804,-0.8807,2020-09-06 00:00:00,4,"I did manage to get through it all, but there are times when the director, producer, writer, and actors have something in mind, and yet it never comes to fruition. I often think of the execs having to sit through this and try to get this kinda of film motivation for the public to go and see it, buy it and rent it. I have no doubt they would struggle, but are talented to come up with enough hype due to the gravitas of the people attached to it.It is all down to that.The story is a mess, a blur and a trod through grime - literary. It has no heart. That was the main problem with it. I didn't care for no one, cheer for someone, rally against anyone... nothing of the sort. It falls flat in to a densely abysmal turmoil of a film.At least I got it for 50p at a charity shop, so not much wasted there...."
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.9144,2020-08-30 00:00:00,9,Not an action movie or thriller or science fiction but excellent director with Tom Hardy's outstanding performance is beyond words.

" historically incorrect political propaganda
",-0.25,-0.9985,2020-07-19 00:00:00,1,"This film is full of prejudices, propaganda, factual errors and plot holes. There is no single positive person in a whole film except two main characters. Moscow and all cities shown are dark, filthy, polluted and dirty. All system is corrupted and it seems that police is doing all they can-NOT to catch a killer. In reality Chikatilo, real serial killer, committed murders from 1978 to 1990 and not after the world war II during Stalin era as it was shown in the film. It is not true that the state was trying to deny existence of a killer (and murders generally) in Soviet Union. In fact, a team that was established to work on a case consisted of 10 investigators. In film, only the lead character is trying to catch a killer and the whole state is against him in an attempt to prove that there is no crime in a perfect state, no murder in paradise. Again wrong, all newspapers at the time were writing about murders and serial killer, even Chikatilo himself was reading about his murders in the papers. There are so many improbable things, small woman (scene in a train) kills a man 2 times bigger than herself who was also carrying a knife, killer in a factory recognizes inspector who is chasing him-how? Pacing is slow, a lot of time is wasted on depicting bad officials and dialogue between two main characters Leo and Raisa (no chemistry at all, bad acting). What should be the main part of the film-serial killer who killed more than 50 people is less than 20% of a film. Serial killer character is unconvincing, cartoonish, even laughable. This film is boring and just plain bad."
" I don't get the negative reviews... at all
",0.4585,0.9518,2020-07-15 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely loved this movie. I don't understand the negative reviews, unless there are a bunch of butt-hurt Russian trolls on here (wouldn't be surprised, frankly, since they are pretty much everywhere else on the internet). Definitely worth the watch as an excellent period piece and slow-burn suspense movie."
" I guess I am the major exception
",0.0,0.995,2020-06-30 00:00:00,9,I am a big fan of Tom Hardy but truth be told I first became attracted to his style of acting and him as an actor while watching this film I think Noomi Rapace is a very talented actress and she made another movie with Tom Hardy that I am aware of and also saw but at the moment I can't think of the title I do know they work well together and the rest of the cast is phenomenal I think the staging is excellent One gets a very good feel of the drudgery of the Soviet union at the time I think the film itself is well done It actually is one of my favorites I know it's not a blockbuster as Mr. Hardy has made already more than once but acting as usual is terrific. I could be more prolific but plainly obviously I do like this film and it's 5:10 AM and I have not slept yet so please excuse the elementary style of my expression of praiseworthiness !!

" Good, but could have been great
",0.8225,0.872,2020-06-07 00:00:00,7,Sort of confused about the massive chasm between ratings Seems you either love this movie or hate it. I thought it was good. Started off strong and had a reasonably strong story-line but got a bit lost midway through. Sort of seemed they needed to finish up the movie and just rushed it at the end like they lost track of time. Had potential to be much better but still considered it suitably entertaining.
" Hardy and Kinnaman, what a treat, 2 most awesome actors, as always Hardy and Kinnaman 100% owned their characters.
",0.9099,-0.4398,2020-06-04 00:00:00,10,"Depressing and horrific storyline, made worse in that it was based on true events, the only reason why i stuck with it, as it was very hard to follow at times, was because of Hardy and Kinnaman who both turned out Oscar earning performances.
it was a bit confusing, but in reality i guess those times were confusing.
In all a brilliant watch, which is haunting and stays with you for days after watching."
" We're already dead
",-0.6486,-0.9822,2020-05-20 00:00:00,9,"Child 44 is so much more than just crime. Yes the movie rotates about the killing of children however the actual drama, tension and horrific atmosphere lays in the system and society/politics during that time (true or fictional is not up to me to decide on). The movie managed to paint an intense picture of a very special era. Disturbing, and in its authenticity and accuracy plain awful to watch. Fear and paranoia washes out even the smallest bit of kindness.
despotism everywhere, no matter what u do or don't do, everything can be interpreted as wrong and used against u. condemn was only one vehicle for pure cruelty and destroying life after life after life.
The male lead said at one point:
We're already dead. Which was only one of many memorable situations which left me speechless and touched me deeply.
An excellent cast in an excellent movie."
" A remarkable failure
",0.0772,-0.8908,2020-05-09 00:00:00,4,"A best-selling book loosely based on one of the maddest true life serial killers ever. How could a film adaptation with Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman go wrong?Well, it did. Dingy rather than dark. Slow rather than tense. Ridiculous accents. Obvious goofs. Pretty much every nationality present except Russian. Then there's the actual plot. Leo and Raisa's relationship is totally 1D, which kind of undermines the entire story. The relationship between Leo and the killer, too.This pleases no one.Thriller lovers will be bored. Russians and slavs will find it hilarious and inaccurate. Fans of true crime will find it irrelevant. Fans of the book will be disappointed."
" Emotional and bleek
",0.1531,-0.9633,2020-04-07 00:00:00,6,A melancholy murder mystery weaves its way through the bleek rural backdrop of Soviet Russia. A hero of the revolution battles the beurocracy of the government that he helped build to solve a series of connected murders in outskirts of Russia. It gets complicated when no one wants to admit that a murder exists since there can't be any murders in 'Paradise'.
" Under-rated, dark and disturbing
",-0.5106,-0.9916,2020-03-21 00:00:00,9,"Vicious real life killer Andrei Chikatilo killed at least 50 women and child from 1978 to 1990. So horrible were his crimes that the Russian government unwittingly allowed him to kill for years by claiming these vile murders were accidents and silencing the parents of the murder victims.In this dark and disturbing dramatization Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace race surreptitiously through the USSR's grim landscape while being hunted down by elements of the Russian military.This movie is completely under-rated and has an unmistakable substance."
" Russia was that bad.
",-0.5423,-0.9195,2020-02-21 00:00:00,10,"For those who think this movie is just Russian bashing, itis not. The events surrounding the child killer was accurate, less children would have died at the hand of that filthy animal had they not ""pretended"" serial killers did not exist in Russia, and it was far worse what he did to those children than depicted in the film. The film was based on actual events they never said it was a biography. Look at the film for what it is, an entertaining thriller which sadly had a real serial killer. Tom Hardy is wonderful, as is the cast.This is not a throwback of the cold war-this was how Russia ruled and sadly a lot of lives were lost. So watch the film, a lot of negative reviews were criticizing the depiction of Russia, read the actual accounts of how Russia handled the case and see if Child 44 just made that up."
" Nothing extraordinary about it
",0.0,0.2732,2020-02-09 00:00:00,5,Citizen X was way better than this strange lookalike ripoff. Even if it had famous actors both swedish and americans it didn't live up to the repetation it has.
" Obviously cut down heavily
",-0.2732,-0.9991,2020-02-04 00:00:00,2,"I was very unsurprised by the information that the first cut of this film was over five hours long. The final product of Child 44 is the exact right mix of overstuffed and underdeveloped that would come with shaving three hours out of a five hour movie while trying to keep as much in as possible. The big moments are still there, but so much of the connective tissue is gone.There are really two interrelated stories at play in this film. The first is what's on the posters and what was made into the television movie Citizen X, the story of a child murdered in the Soviet Union. Murders don't happen in the Soviet Union. Murder, according to Stalin, is a purely capitalistic disease and murders, as gets said several times, do not happen in paradise.This story gets sidelined for long stretches by the second story, which is a more expansive view of life in Soviet Russia as seen through the eyes of Leo Demidov, an MGB agent, and his wife Raisa. This tries to capture the horror of daily life in the Soviet police state, where every word could be reported to authorities and your entire life ended by mere suspicion. That's dramatized early when Leo himself tracks down a veterinarian who immediately starts running when he sees MGB agents on his tail. He's not guilty of anything, but he knows that if he gets caught then his life is over.The movie starts both of these stories pretty well, giving us time to appreciate the slow horror of both of them, but by about the halfway point, once Leo gets demoted to the militia and sent to the country, things begin to skip and speed up. Gary Oldman is prominently featured in the marketing, but he has about a scene and a half. We skip through the investigation of further child murders to suddenly get a complete list and Leo and Raisa have to go back to Moscow for unclear reasons. There they interact with one of Raisa's former fellow teachers who ends up being an MGB spy trying to entrap people at the school, and it gets revealing while Leo is killing the man with a phone cord. The two end up on the run, but it's unclear why. Is it because they killed the man without anyone witnessing the murder? Is it because they got into Moscow on faked papers?And why does Leo continue this investigation, especially after he's been released from the police. He ends up taking Raisa around to a manufacturing plant where they track down the killer before getting into a fistfight with a former fellow MGB agent who's tracked them down. The connective tissue between all of these scenes is gone.Mentioning Citizen X is instructive. It strives to tell only half the story that Child 44 does, and it does it much better because it has over 100 minutes to dedicate only to that. It's not a great film, but it's a solid procedural from another world. Looking at the similar story of Child 44, they only dedicated about sixty minutes to the crime and investigation itself, and it's lost in a bunch of other shortened stuff along with it.The action of the film ends when Leo and the antagonistic MGB agent get into a fistfight in the mud. Now, a second for an aesthetic comment. When you make your film aesthetically unpleasant, you build a handicap for yourself because your film is simply unpleasant to look at. You can still make a great film, but you're making the job harder for yourself. This may be appropriate considering the material at hand, but it doesn't change the reality that making a movie that is ugly to look at will not help you with most audiences. Child 44 is, from beginning to end, hard to simply look at. On top of that, it's about a child murderer and the oppressive life under Stalin. There are levels of ugly to this film that extend deep into the subtext, and it never lets up, culminating in the fistfight that ends with one man getting his head violently thrown against a rock. I'm not saying this movie is bad because it's ugly (I think I've listed the reasons clearly enough), but the ugliness simply put up a barrier between artist and audience that may not have been completely necessary. As a counterpoint, I think of Tarkovsky's Stalker, which was filmed in a Soviet state, in a region of industrial decline and nuclear radiation, but it's gorgeous to look at despite all that.It's ugly, about difficult material, and it shortchanges every aspect of its storytelling because they never found a way to write a screenplay condensed enough to tell the story they wanted to tell. They filmed it all and ended up having to shorten it significantly in editing to disastrous results. Perhaps the full five hour version is a better film, but we'll never see it because the movie ended up losing so much money that the studio will never touch it again."

" Slow burn, but worth your time
",0.3291,0.9827,2019-12-23 00:00:00,8,"A compelling story, and I sense the screenplay has stuck very close to the novel (I can almost detect specific lines from the book in this). I'm going to read it right away!
Excellent turns from the always honest, complex Tom Hardy, and mercurial Gary Oldman. Joel Kinnaman (I'd only seen him in House of Cards, up to now), Paddy Constantine (can he just be in everything? Playing wonderfully well against type, here), and Noomi Rapace are all compelling ambiguous, and all actors convey excellent depth, subtly communicating the back stories of their characters with deft show-don't-tell. Good, also, to see Jason Clarke. Pretty much my favourite lineup of character actors! All they needed was Jared Harris, but the always wonderful Mark Lewis Jones fills that gap with no problems!
The end is particularly worth the journey, but I can't help but think this storyline would've been better served by a mini-series, allowing more time and pace to develop the themes and context (aspects the thoughtful, experienced and utterly believable cast manage to do, nonetheless). Beautiful production design and sense of culture/society/place. Again, another reason to read the novel."

" Gripping.
",0.0,-0.7538,2019-09-24 00:00:00,7,"A very chilling indictment of how corrupt the post-war Soviet Union government (now Russia) was, Child 44 is about a serial killer of young boys that no-one seems to want to catch. After all, it might have negative implications for the fake 'paradise' they've created.The authorities blame everything to make the problems go away... first they put the murder down to train accidents, then they pin the blame on some poor mentally disabled guy who can't argue back.As the grisly murders continue apace though and whispers of dissent start getting louder, one courageous officer is willing to ignore the party line to try cracking the case himself... even at the cost of his career and possibly, his own life. Are you excited yet?!Tom Hardy tries his hand at a Russian accent and at creating a sympathetic hero, succeeding on both counts. The actress playing his wife also does a fine job, strong, determined and with secrets of her own. Finally, if Joel Kinnaman's main brief was for us to despise him as the villain, then mission successful I'd say.It shines a light on a particularly brutal period in history, where the Russian state demanded absolute loyalty in all circumstances (and due to a combination of violence & murder, usually got it). The sad truth is though, it's unclear just how much has changed...Anyway, what can't be denied is this movie is a good watch, and the ending is symbolically a perfect way to conclude a thoroughly engaging experience. 7/10"

" There is a murder mystery somewhere in here
",-0.6908,-0.9946,2019-07-22 00:00:00,3,"There was an interesting story here about a hunt for a grotesque child killer. Too often the main plot goes off the rails and is more to do with an unhinged subordinate with a grudge.Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) is orphan turned war hero. Now in the early 1950s he is a high flying secret service officer in Stalin's Soviet Union. A state where murder does not exist in paradise. Murder is a capitalist disease. When they come across a murder it tends to be reclassified as an unfortunate accident.Leo comes across the death of a child near a train line. His father is a fellow friend and comrade. The father believes it was murder but Leo persuades him to forget about it.However deranged underling Vasili (Joel Kinnaman) has nefarious plans for Leo because Leo challenged him when he killed two people for harbouring a fugitive. He also has desires for Leo's wife Raisa (Noomi Rapace) who is accused of unpatriotic activities and Leo fails to denounce her.Leo is demoted and exiled to the remote town of Volsk. Leo works under General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman) who is at first suspicious of Leo, especially when a child's body is discovered along the rail line. However both reluctantly team up when they discover there have been a spate of similar killings over the years.There are several plot strands that compete for attention and the film never properly gels. In fact it is a dour stodgy mess that neglects the important part of the movie so it can have a go at the nightmare of Stalinism."

And the commentary that is left is more of the ""this is what life was like under communism"" and less of the ""this is how the communist system interfered with the investigation and postponed his arrest""You can kind of taste the difference between the two, as they are both important, the cops look more incompetent with this version, and that is, I think, doing them a bit of a disservice.On the other hand, I doubt one would see either criticism if it were made today, so...take what you can get."

" Relentlessly grim
",-0.5719,0.8971,2018-08-28 00:00:00,4,"""Child 44"" has a stellar cast and a classic premise: A tough, gritty cop on the hunt for a gruesome serial child killer. The twist is that the ""cop"" is a Stalin-era MGB agent, Leo (Tom Hardy). He's a former orphan who became a war hero, and now lives in a spacious apartment with his beautiful schoolteacher wife, Raisa (Noomi Rapace). The plot, based on an award-winning novel, is convoluted, but mainly hinges on Leo's growing interest in a mysterious string of deaths of young boys, and his dogged determination to crack the case as his privileged status in the Soviet hierarchy unravels. Yet the film is weighed down by too many side plots, and hits you over the head with endless examples of how horrible it was to live under the Stalin regime. ""Child 44"" is a relentlessly grim movie, with heaps of gratuitous violence (even when it doesn't really advance the story). Many of the scenes are dimly lit, everything colored in browns and grays. Leo and Raisa have a strange, uneven relationship, and it's very hard to grasp her motivation for doing anything she does in this film, other than that she was living in a constant state of fear because she's in a totalitarian state. Her character makes no sense, even though she's in most of the scenes. A waste of a great actress like Rapace (the original ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"").The serial killer plot feels stale. ""Child 44"" seems less focused on the mystery solving and more on all the suspicion, backstabbing, blackmail, ratting out on your friends, police state brutality and bureaucratic oppression of the old USSR. I love Tom Hardy, and he does infuse his portrayal of Leo with pathos, longing, pain and gritty determination to do the right thing in a corrupt system. But this film's script and direction are just muddled. Kids, if you want to watch a far superior, engaging movie with a similar premise, opt for ""Gorky Park"" instead. Sorry! With some of my favorite actors in the cast, I wanted to like this more than I did."

The result is generalised fear and a perfect breeding ground for cowardly monsters. Fortunately, there are always some with the character and courage to resist.
The acting is perfect, making the film feel very real (if one can ignore the fact that all the Russians are speaking heavily accented English - but to be fair, what sort of a cinema audience would one attract with a film in Russian with English subtitles; it is a business looking for a market, after all)."

As with many movies over the past 20 years, almost all scenes appear to have been shot with the camera's lens closed down a number of stops, thereby producing a dark, dark scene & atmosphere, hardly ever actually called for by activity. Granted, the subject matter is dark and nasty, but that is no excuse for continual scenes in which we can barely make out faces even. Bad, bad, bad !Further, much of the audio is difficult to follow, owing in part to mumbled lines, contorted accents, plus interfering background effects & music.

" Chilling glimpse of life under socialism
",-0.0258,0.8205,2017-10-02 00:00:00,9,"Beautifully and efficiently told story of a couple living in post war socialist Ukraine, trying to live normal lives when all lives are controlled by 'the state'. Daily life constrained by fear, lies, and the absolute power of authorities at various levels of seniority. Mixed into this is a back story of a serial child killer. What hope for justice in this environment where justice is whatever 'the authorities' want it to be? The real monsters are everywhere, have free reign and are unpunished whilst the innocents suffer repression. This fine film might chill the heart of anyone purporting to romanticise life under socialism.This tale is also a chilling glimpse of a dystopian future. Beautifully acted, this is not a slow plodding European arty movie. It is fast, efficiently told, and has avoided being sensationalist. The script is precise and the main character has the gravitas, integrity and virtue that a viewer can admire in a hero. I thought this movie was a thousand times better than the ridiculous Dunkirk supposedly depicting war and madness. And what can I say about the much undeservedly feted movie 'Mother' that attempts to depict a similar theme as this film with nonsensical storyline and gratuitous violence? I don't know why Child 44 is not admired more. It is a very fine film, and deserves accolades."
" Strong story, flawed in the telling
",0.5106,-0.9697,2017-08-23 00:00:00,6,"A serial murderer is at large in Stalinist USSR (1945). The victims are young boys. That is the background to what is really an attack on Stalinist tactics. We don't see much of the crime or even the investigation. Mostly we see a Western take on Soviet suppression. Don't get me wrong, Stalin was a mass murderer on a historic scale, and deserves vilification. But his minions were individuals. ""Child 44"" doesn't recognize such complexity. Instead, it reduces almost every character to good or evil. The exception is Raisa (Noomi Rapace in a beautiful performance), the wife of a captain in Soviet intelligence, Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy, in what may be his best performance to date). The arc of the story takes her from feeling forced into a marriage to a powerful gendarme to the dawning realization that Leo is a good man struggling with his brutal role and reputation in society.Ultimately, the two principal bad guys-- the child murderer (Paddy Considine) and Leo's colleague and nemesis (Joel Kinnaman)-- are nothing more than plot devices to deliver scenes of brutality, including a protracted beating of Leo. I saw the film streaming on TV, so I could fast-forward through scenes that made me suspect sadistic tendencies in the director, Daniel Espinosa. The only other film of his that I saw, ""Safe House,"" showed the same tendencies ( and his 2017 movie ""Life"" has no shortage of pain and gore, according to reviews I read.) I'm not squeamish; there is a place for violence in cinema. But Espinosa indulged in it well beyond the needs of the story. The running time of 137 minutes is a tell. And the power of the story is not about the Soviet purges and gulags, where violence occurred. The story, at its heart, is about one spouse finding the true moral character in another-- a wife learning to trust her husband's love, and coming to love him in return. It's too bad such sensitivity didn't inform all the characters in the story, or spare the audience the excessive bloodthirst."
" A grim tale of a dark subject.
",-0.5719,-0.9101,2017-08-02 00:00:00,7,"Set in Stalin's post-war Soviet Union, this story of serial child killings runs parallel with that of the strained relations between Hardy and Rapace's lead characters, Leo and Raisa. In Moscow, the discovery of a friend's son's body and the state's denial of such crimes and subsequent cover up provoke something in Leo. He uses his powers as a senior Soviet police officer to pursue the perpetrator, against orders. This, combined with an embarrassing clash with a fellow comrade sees him stripped of rank and dispatched to a dystopian, remote industrial town as punishment. Dismissed from her teaching job, Raisa goes with him. As forces conspire against Leo, they must make a stand together. So, a different town but yet, another murder. What is their connection? Desperate to find answers, especially for his friend, Leo must persuade the local police chief that there is a connection between here and Moscow, where his case started. This film depicts the daily grind and harshness endured by the Soviet people together with the political paranoia prevalent during this era. All of this portrayed convincingly by a quality cast."
" Thriller plot forgets thrills and plot
",0.4404,-0.0156,2017-07-30 00:00:00,3,"What a bizarrely dull waste. The successful Child 44 book had three or four things going for it: a stunningly atmospheric opening in a winter of starvation (here rushed over and its relevance weakened), a big reveal (cut), the evolving relationship between Demidov and his wife as they first realize the emptiness of what they thought they had and then build anew (next to Noomi Rapace's pained wisdom Tom Hardy's Leo is a nice picture of inarticulate bewildered loyalty, war hero as premiership footballer out of his depth, but it doesn't go anywhere) and a reasonable cat-and-mouse/chase plot. Trying to squeeze in most of the narrative of the book, but still dropping a couple of significant facts and incidents, the film manages somehow to be both too long and too rushed. The Demidovs hurry back and forth across Russia having unpleasant train incidents, the commuter experience from hell, and then the mystery gets addressed in a couple of brisk and largely unrelated bits of business at the end. Espinosa worthily films most of the book, but loses its sense and its drama. Child 44 has some vivid styling and performances (largely for decoration – Cassel is intimidating because he's Cassel, nothing more; Oldman has to resort to maximum shouting-and-spitting to get any drama into his scenes; Dance, as so often, is paraded as a token of film gravity), but it's otherwise as empty and lifeless as its Siberian wilderness.The Script Hack (https://thescripthack.wordpress.com/): if we're skipping the plot relevance of the starvation opening, we can skip the whole scene; if we're dropping the key bits of information gained from the mid-story return to Moscow, we can drop that whole sequence; and we could trim some of the secondary scenes (the last, for example, nicely true to the book, could be 30 seconds instead of five minutes). That would create much more time and space to pace and build the mystery and anticipation and drama of the hunt, and the relationships at its heart, and still leave a tighter more powerful film."

At first seemed we search for a murders done by Soviet system, then ups!-it's not, there is somebody, a single killer, but seems protected by government (why?who knows!), then we have some stupid short story about drugged nazidivisions which are inserted into the Soviet-system to revenge their defeat in war. At the end- No,again! It is all about a sick ex-soviet officer from the WW2 who is crying at the end end being shot just 2 minutes after showing up in the movie. The movie has been directed as there was a small child behind the scene, not a grown up. TERRIBLE! I give 4/10 just for a good actors team gathered, even their performance was poor, but again thanks to Espinosa."
" Russian pronunciation?
",0.0,-0.8148,2017-03-28 00:00:00,3,"Tom Hardy speaking with a Russian pronunciation and the wrong grammar when everybody else speaks normal English is the most stupid thing I have ever seen in a movie. For this alone, I'll give it 3 stars. As for the plot, which is based on a real event, the famous Chikatilo murders, it's been done a lot better in another movie with Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. I don't remember the title,though."
" Disappointing -- Read the Book Instead
",-0.4939,-0.0772,2017-03-12 00:00:00,4,"I was quite disappointed because I had read the book, which I recommend instead. The book has some stunning surprises and plot twists -- all of which were eliminated for this movie. As a result, much doesn't make sense.Important characters -- including the killer -- are undeveloped.The movie does a fair job of capturing the feeling of oppression, although the paranoia in the book is more intense."
" Almost perfect...
",0.0,0.9987,2017-03-09 00:00:00,9,"Let me begin with a confession: As far as I know I am heterosexual, but I have a very non-heterosexual fixation on Tom Hardy. And Idris Elba. And Carey Price. And Benedict Cumberbatch... But most of all, on Tom Hardy, particularly of late. Since I first discovered him... (That's right, I discovered him. At least that's how it works in my mind...) In the film Warrior, which I and a few friends only went to see as a kind of joke. I mean, none of us was expecting a movie around Mixed Martial Arts to actually be any good, and none of us had ever heard of the two leads, Hardy and Joel Edgerton. (Oh, yeah, him too...) So we were expecting it to be awful in that way that you can sarcastically make fun of for years to come. I have an extensive background in boxing and Mixed Martial Arts, so I was expecting to find that amusing and worthy of ridicule as well. (Since then there has been the brilliant television series, Kingdom and the hilarious Here Comes the Boom, so apparently you can make good things around MMA.) We were all particularly shocked by the intense and powerful performance of Tom Hardy. Of course we all assumed he had to be American and must be an experienced Mixed Martial Artist. I had no idea that I had already seen Hardy in RocknRolla and Inception then. Aside from having quickly become one of the finest actors on the planet, Hardy has an ability to physically disappear into roles in a way that we haven't seen since Gary Oldman's early work. Since then I've seen Hardy carry an entire film just driving in a car and talking on the phone in Locke, make you forget that you're watching the same actor playing twins in Legend, give powerhouse performances in films like The Drop, The Revenant and Bronson, audience thrilling performances in The Dark Knight Rises and Mad Max, Fury Road, and most recently give one of the best performances seen in a television series since James Gandolfini, his co-star in The Drop, in the stunningly good British production, Taboo. Hardy, as an actor is quite simply as good as it gets. So I found myself looking for anything else that Hardy has done which I somehow might have missed. And a friend told me about Child 44, which I had never even heard of. The film itself stretches believability a bit with the murder mystery aspect, asking us to buy into the idea that a Stalin era MGB (forerunner of the KGB) agent becomes obsessed with a child serial killer while his life is being torn to bits by the agency that he once worked for. The latter part has been written about extensively by writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. It truly was a kind of inevitability that these ""Blue Hats"" would find themselves the subject of the same brutal paranoia and torture which helped them rise to power. Hardy sells the former aspect brilliantly, but even then, it feels a bit thin at times that a man in such an environment would be able to, let alone could become fixated on solving murders in a world where Stalin himself had declared that murder did not exist, that it was a product of corrupt western capitalism. This is a very small, negligible problem with the film because of its brilliant cast, which includes the aforementioned Gary Oldman, Hardy's co-star from The Drop, Noomi Rapace, and Joel Kinnaman, who was so brilliant in the TV series The Killing, as well as films like Suicide Squad, as the villain (Yeah, okay, he's another one...). There is also a wonderful sub textual underpinning of the paranoia of that time and place and how that can lead to a world where nothing is what you think it is. Hardy's lumbering stoic presence is yet one more remarkable physical transformation. As is almost always the case with Hardy, and with so many great British actors, there is never a moment of self indulgence or sentimentality about his character, which is dead on for this particular character. Rapace, who is no stranger to strange European murder mystery, having risen to wide public acclaim in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, is wonderfully guarded and unreadable as Hardy's perhaps not so willing wife. Kinnaman, also having a background in Swedish film, is disturbingly calloused and unfeeling as Hardy's nemesis. And of course there's Gary Oldman, who, like Hardy, seems incapable of giving anything less than great performances. In this film, we see some vintage almost impossibly textured Gary Oldman moments, though his role is only slightly more than a kind of cameo. The rest of the cast is equally superb and the filmmaking is perfectly dark and brooding. That previously mentioned thin premise is almost entirely overpowered by the strength of the whole and is made only a minor blemish on an otherwise very close to perfect canvas. If you love Tom Hardy, even in a non-heterosexual way, you will definitely love this movie. Not quite as much as you may have loved Taboo, Locke, The Drop or Warrior. But probably as much as you loved Bronson or Legend."
" A Sloppily Put Together Crime Thriller
",-0.4767,-0.9242,2017-02-09 00:00:00,4,"Child 44 follows a man who, after learning of the deaths of several children, begins a search for the man who murdered them, despite the fact that they were written off as accidents. I love me a good crime thriller, really I do. And when I see a plot like this where the movie is brave enough to deal with a subject like murdering children, then it casts Tom Hardy, then color me interested. Unfortunately, the actual plot doesn't start until the last forty minutes of this 137 minutes film. And even then, none of it is really all that interesting or even easy to follow. In fact by the time the plot starts rolling the script just stops trying to make sense. There's a scene that, under normal circumstances, would sound pretty awesome where a bunch of people start fighting and killing each other on a train cart, but in context there isn't actually any. The scene begins when some random expendable character pulls out a knife and tries to attack the protagonists. Somehow said protagonists know exactly what he's planning the second he stands up, and this big fight ensues. Sure, it's cool, but it doesn't make any sense. At that point I gave up on trying to understand the movie. The actual finding of the killer ends up being super anti- climatic and watered down, and it's just not engaging at all. What about the 100 minutes leading up to the actual plot you may ask? Nothing happens. It's 'character development' where none of the characters are interesting and nothing that pulls, or more drags, the oncoming plot along are anything special. It's just a whole lot of nothing.Overall Child 44 is kind of boring and dumb for the vast majority of it, yet somehow worse when the actual plot starts. In the end I would never recommend this colossal waste of time and talent."
" A rare gem!
",0.0,0.9838,2017-01-18 00:00:00,9,"Wow! Where to begin? I had skipped this movie earlier when it was available for buying but after watching recent performances of Tom Hardy, I thought to give this movie a go and judge it for myself. And boy was I surprised! This is such an underrated movie for no reason at all. After watching the movie, it's baffling to see the negative reviews and low scores this movie received. It's totally beyond my understanding what could've been the possible reason for this movie to get such a hammering from critics. Everything in the movie was top notch, right from the layered story, the mood of the time in which this takes place, the performances, I mean everything! Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace, the two leads were just perfect. It's disheartening to see why this movie wasn't considered for any awards or a positive genuine review. There are some unanswered questions as to how Tom Hardy's character was fully reinstated and some other minor things towards the end but overall this is a really dark and powerful movie which raises some sensitive issues and is blessed with genuine performances. I sure am glad that I watched this rare gem."
" Too depressing and awful
",-0.6808,-0.9696,2017-01-07 00:00:00,1,"So this is how Russia was like during the days of the USSR, just absolutely horrible all with a broken law system and having absolutely no freedom.The film itself was too awfully depressing and sad in a grim way, all this just made the film incredibly dull. There was absolutely no sense of nice things to come, just more bad news and the story was far too incredibly hard and confusing to follow.I just didn't like this film despite this film having good talented actors like Gary Oldman. Most of the film was simply too boring and uninteresting.I would seriously recommend everyone to avoid this film, a film this boring and hard to follow is not worth watching."
