" Keeps your attention
",0.0,0.3167,2021-04-09 00:00:00,9,"Really great characters, with heartbreaking decisions. Amazing finale for Alan Rickman, ""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war."
" Excellent film but infuriating (Spoilers)
",-0.5023,-0.9793,2021-04-05 00:00:00,8,"This film is thrilling but maddening. It's impossible to think that the West will ever win the war on terror if the US and UK are willing to hold up a drone strike on two ready-to-go suicide bombers because one child is in the way. That may sound harsh but all those involved know that if they don't take out these bombers as well as the three top terrorists in the room with them, then dozens more people will likely die.I am also dismayed that the politicians involved were more concerned with how it would look for them and who would win the propaganda war.Most unbelievable is that an American pilot (played by Aaron Paul) would refuse to strike when ordered. This is the military filtered through the eyes of bleeding-heart Hollywood. A soldier who gets that emotional is in the wrong job.Thank God that Alan Rickman's military character has the last word, ""Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war."""

" The changing war, or not
",-0.5994,-0.7582,2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"One of the most powerful films I have ever seen. Anxiety to no end in a world as terrible as it is realistic. War evolves, we are in the days of drones, but the difficulty of pulling the trigger persists."

I often wonder how many terrorists HAVE blown up shopping malls, resorts, and neighborhood markets-all because idiots in suits were to scared to grow a pair. It's losers like those depicted in this film that have caused many of the threats to proliferate throughout the world.The movie was excellent."

It's a movie that has you wondering what was truly the right thing to do, and it was so intense that it's advised to get up and take a minute to breathe. The writing is also well done, with some lines sticking with you for months. Alan Rickman and Helen Mirren give incredible performances in this standout movie."
" Old good story-masterpiece
",0.4404,0.9288,2020-12-31 00:00:00,8,"Nothing fancy-yet a great film. The directing was solid and didn't stick out, while the cinematography was what you'd expect from a film so closely related to the military, with realistic sets, however lacking the emotional manipulation techniques other modern films successfully incorporate. The visual effects and especially the explosions were near-perfect, yet they only served a purpose in maintaining the coherence of the film, not actually being an asset to it. The editing and acting are simply on-point, nice and discreet. And finally to the biggest asset of the movie, the script, a surprisingly original idea, revealing a different aspect of the endless military ""bureaucracy"" as well as making the viewer question their mental endurance. Reminds me of the first war movies, just improved in pretty much every aspect."
" Very good...

The film wasn't great overall and just shows how incompetent our politicians can be.Its no wonder why there are so many attacks that get through with these middle aged women putting the life of 1 person (just because they are a child) over potentially hundreds of others. They had no issue that a man nearly died trying to save the girl,showing just how ageist and sexist the attitudes displayed in the film were. Abhorrent"
" Absorbing but not realistic
",0.0,-0.3566,2020-11-13 00:00:00,7,The armed forces and political leaders would have established rules of engagement and operation well in advance so the agonised protracted dilemma about loss of life would not have been faced in real time.

This is one particular operation out of thousands, and it brings us in on the competing perspectives of the military, civilian govt, and allied/diplomatic issues that can all arise during the prosecution of an operation. With a relatively short 90-min run time, you're not left looking at your watch/clock as to when it ends."
" Good military suspense
",0.4404,0.4306,2020-10-31 00:00:00,8,"I've watched the movie on watcha. and, feels it was a good military suspense with a message. ( whatever a viewer agreed that or not)I know some viewer are criticizing it's not real enough. but, why it should be?
It's not a documentary, nor a debate. It's just a movie.
It has enough suspense, high tech weapons, and several messages we could think about. (Even it has Jessie Pinkman.)If you are a military suspense fan. You won't regret it.
My rating is 8 (RECOMMENDED)"
" Better than I expected
",0.4404,0.6597,2020-10-13 00:00:00,7,A solid 7. They managed to squeeze out a surprising amount of tension and suspense from this one mission scenario. Good acting combined with realistic location shooting made it work well.

" the new rules of engagement
",0.4588,0.6972,2020-07-31 00:00:00,7,"The main reason I decided to see 'Eye in the Sky' is called Helen Mirren. I am an unconditional admirer of this actress who has never disappointed me, not even in the movies that did not deserve her. The 2015 film by South African director Gavin Hood was a pleasant surprise. I had no great hopes, because the trailers and comments I had read indicated that it was a military techno-thriller, a genre that I am not excited by. The presumptions were correct, but the film managed to captivate me first of all because it is very well made, and secondly because beyond the action plot it manages to create true situations and characters and raises interesting problems and dilemmas related to the morality of the military commands and of their execution in the fight against terrorism.The screenplay written by Guy Hibbert spreads its heroes around the globe. Soldiers, officers and generals, politicians, lawyers and their secretaries, terrorists and innocent potential victims are located in Kenya, England,heartland USA, Singapore, China. They are brought together on the same screen or on the same screens by the video cameras installed on the spy planes and on the drones, which collect information about an imminent terrorist attack that can only be stopped by a preventive blow that risks producing collateral victims. Excellently made visually, well and fluently edited, 'Eye in the Sky' is a successful combination of techno-thriller series like 'Alias' and' Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove' with its command and decision rooms. The decisions made by politicians divided between 'hawks', 'doves' and those who hesitate in the middle have life and death consequences for those on the ground. It is one of the first films to raise the issue of the morality of actions in the fight against international terrorism and the impossibility of separating between the most advanced technologies (surveillance systems, drones, 'precision' weapons) and their consequences. Even if the credibility of the plot is debatable and from different points of view the approach may seem too critical or too idealized, I think the film has the merit of discussing these issues.The team of actors does their job in an exemplary way. Helen Mirren, who has recently accustomed us to queen costumations, is credible as well in a role in uniform. The excellent Somali actor Barkhad Abdi plays another of the 'local' African roles that have become his specialty. Aaron Paul provides an emotional counterpoint in the role of an officer who does not limit to blindly carrying out orders. At the other end of the military scale we have Alan Rickman, in his last role on the big screens, unfortunately ending his career, but with a memorable line - ""You never have to explain to a soldier what the price of war is."" It is a moral assertion that we can only hope that it's understood by as many of the world's military as possible."

" Frustratingly S L O W
",-0.4588,-0.9994,2020-07-07 00:00:00,1,"07JUL2020 {1/10 stars F} Recommend? No; Slow, unrealistic, intelligence insulting military fiction.I did not choose to play this movie, but watched anyway. Stupid, slow movie. Everyone should know by now there will always be collateral damage in war. Of course, precautions need to be taken to confirm a target, and they do that. But after that this movie gets ridiculous and outlandish with everyone ""passing the buck"" even though clearance for the drone strike has been given.No one cares about the many other innocent people that may be killed or injured by the drone missile explosion, they only care about if one particular pre-teen girl is killed or injured! Why are the US and UK, including all the way up to the UK Prime Minister, making decisions about whether or not innocent Kenyan lives should be jeopardized to kill some terrorists in Kenya?! The government of Kenya would have the most interest and influence in deciding if they want to jeopardize innocent lives of their fellow countrymen to kill terrorists.The movie gets even more ridiculous when two drone pilots get emotional and teary eyed about the likely death of one innocent girl due to them firing a drone missile that is going to explode close to her. For the two drone pilots to be given the task of operating a flying weapon they need to have the skill set and go through extensive training. Considering the precision required for this mission to minimize innocent casualties the pilots would have flown many other missions and experienced death many times prior to this mission. For them to become emotionally distraught and one of them refuse an order to fire because of this one circumstance is plain dumb and really insults the intelligence of the audience.After the mission is over the commanding officer of the pilot doesn't even reprimand the pilot or remove him from being a pilot for disobeying a direct order. Considering how awful they made this portrayal they should've just went all the way with the pilots and their commanding officer crying their eyes out together while eating from a tub of ice cream. The video production and sound quality was good. No unrealistic use of special effects or CGI.CONTENT ADVISORY: Talk about suicide bombings and bombers, two men shown several times from a distance preparing for a suicide bombing with explosives being placed in vests worn by the men. A Kenyan spy being chased and shot at with automatic gun fire. Human death via two military drone missile strikes with realistic explosions and destruction shown.

Blood, flesh wounds and death shown from the missile strikes.{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}(Tangent: I'm a very patriotic natural born citizen of the United States. The USA military industrial complex has become a HUGE money maker for the US government (through taxes), military contractors, suppliers etc. I am tired of the endless wars, foreign wars, proxy wars, my country fighting battles for other countries and the USA using NGO's to invade and control other countries. I'm also against the UN, WHO, IMF and all other international ""agencies"" that think they call the shots and can tell countries what to do.Citizens of some countries protest and get angry about their countries being occupied by the United State military. That's good, more people should protest more frequently. The US military is not the World Police for resolving disputes or a ""knight in shining armor"" that comes to the rescue for another countries when there is trouble. Both good and bad kingdoms and countries rise and fall due to military conquest, this is the natural order of things. Even male animals fight or battle for the ability to mate and pass on their genes, humans sometimes use war in a similar way. Strong humans survive war and pass on their genes and the weak oftentimes do not.If you want to save your country from terrorism or being taken over by an invading force you need to use everything at your disposal to defend your country and not expect someone else or another country to do it for you. Your country is your house and it is your job to defend it! Get to know the invading force to learn if there is common ground where a compromise can be reached, use the media or press to share information about the invading force or create your own source of factual information with videos, a blog, newsletters etc, and of course use force to stop and remove the invading force.)"
" The no win scenario
",0.3818,-0.7152,2020-07-05 00:00:00,9,"I'm often critical of drone strikes that take out large numbers of non-combatants. When the choice was the little girl or the 4 terrorists, it was an easy choice to hold fire. But the suicide vests flipped that scenario. At that point, they are going to kill many, and there was still a 1 in 3 chance the little girl survives. You have to play the odds in a no win situation.I would be surprised if drone operators didn't have to go through extensive training for this sort of scenario. You cannot have a soldier ignoring orders like they did. As I recall, those that have to fire nukes go thru much training to make sure that they will follow orders when the time comes.I find it inexcusable that a drone would only have 1 type of weapon."

What a great choice it was!The fact that the entire film is in real time, meaning we watch the event as they unfold in real time, makes it a true edge-of-the-seat stuff. Acting was nothing to brag about but the story was great.

" Fantastic film
",0.5574,0.9227,2020-05-26 00:00:00,7,"The complexity of drone warfare, which triggers a series of strategic decisions, moral crises, collateral damage and buck-passing, is also part of the film's appeal, with its director's clever blend of suspense thrillers and satirical teasers. The film doesn't lean entirely toward dark humor, but this unclassifiable war drama continues to laugh, prompting comparisons with kubrick's classic ""Dr. Strangelove."" The film is entertaining as a political thriller. Sharp editing amplifies the sense of tension, contrasting the bleak, closed interior with the crisislurking exterior in broad daylight. The art direction and special effects further enhance the credibility of the film, and the group play is very impressive."

" A fake debate instead of a real one
",-0.4767,-0.8537,2020-04-26 00:00:00,5,"There are obvious reasons to have qualms about a state using surveillance and drones to execute its enemies like a player in a video game from the comfort anmd safety of distance. But in the event that your military happened to spot would-be suicide bombers actually initiating an action, it would seem to be a no-brainer to take action. But this is actually the scenario in 'Eye in the Sky', in which nonetheless a series of legal, politcal and technical obstacles are put in the way of saving 80 people's lives. The politicians are shown as craven, the colonels as tough but human, and none of it feels believable (and that's before one considers that the flying cameras that resemble woodpeckers and ants. Meanwhile, an attempt is made to invest our emotional sympathy in a Keynan girl we know precisely nothing about. Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman are a classy pair of actors, but they never appear in the same room; and sadly their wasted here."

While it is a movie, you are able to see and understand the jobs of many. Example you will get a better understanding how certain roles in the military work. One profession that got my attention in this movie is army drone pilots. Being a army drone pilot is not an easy job. Before seeing this movie, I had no idea about this job. But this movie showed how emotionally draining and difficult this job is. Anyhow this movie was very emotional. This movie will make you reflect over certain things. While this is only a movie, situations that happens in the movie, happens in real life too. It also showed the reality of how some people live today. Their life in poverty and crime. One little girl plays a big role in this movie. I loved that they had this beautiful little girl in this movie. She was the heart of this movie.

War is about killing the other guy before he kills you. And, I can assure you, it is relatively painless, in view of what the other guy has in mind for you. There is no moral dilemma. This is not My Lai (which was not war). All the pained expressions on the actors' faces, the moral dilemmas, the self-evaluations, the . . . well where do you stop? The story, itself, is overblown and is boring for long stretches of time, and the cast is woefully miscast in most of the major parts. Helen Mirren? She does not belong here. Alan Rickman? Ditto.

",0.0,-0.9867,2020-03-25 00:00:00,5,"A strange film that doesn't stand up to scrutiny of it's premise or plot development but does have a good range of performances and a well worked up melodramatic tension at the climax.Demerits for obvious and flat character writing and a plot that becomes, firstly, exaggeratedly wrangled and conflicted and secondly, so decisively focused on it's message about automated warfare, a-symmetric warfare and the technology of surveillance and information that it fails to spot how astonishingly ""racist"" and tone deaf it has to be to eventuate it's moral dilemmas for maximum dramatic effect.I qualified the line of ""racism"" in my critique because it seems entirely unintentional and completely a byproduct of the film makers agenda to question themes on the ethics of modern war fighting and modern civilisation at large.However it really caught my attention as we follow two allies, the UK and US as they attempt to reach a satisfactory mission goal against a key terrorist cell in Kenya.As the stakes get higher and the tension builds due to the surveillance information about the terrorists plans the two militaries and civilian governments thrash out the pros and cons of aggressive and passive approaches to the operation.As a British produced film this is most focused mainly on the military and civilian ""higher ups"" but with key involvement from US counterparts.The third ally party to this operation, being prosecuted entirely in Kenya, namely the Kenyan government, doesn't seem to get a look in. Or a mention. Or a consultation. No communication. Or consideration. Its incredible that the film makers could produce a moral dilemma where the immediate stakes, the immediate serious risks, are being run by Kenya and Kenyans, but utterly minimise that feature of the alliance from any involvement in what happens.Even indirectly, nobody ever says, from a Hawk or Dove stance, what they do or do not owe to their Kenyan ally sovereign nation state. There is no assumption that the Kenyan government is a ""stake holder"" in this drama or dilemma.Incredible. The Kenyan nation is therefore a bystander to the story and to the dilemma and the decisions.It seems such a strange approach, that no substantive account of the third allies needs, wants, opinions, would even be given lipservice from either side of the debate.I think that this criticism strikes tangentially at the crux of the matter regarding 'Eye in the Sky': it is a neat and easy take on a complex and nuanced matrix of problems; the films disregard for any and all things not immediately necessary for it to consider the ethical problems it chooses to address produces a film with as many deficiencies as it has merits.I rate a 5/10 because it does have things to say and it does ratchet up the stakes and tension fairly professionally and there is plenty of capable acting but sadly the writing is nowhere near the standard necessary to do justice to the matters at hand."

" Not for Targeting

Powell rising in the small hours - complete with onscreen caption - is very similar indeed to the equivalent scene that opens the earlier film of Gen. Black waking from a nightmare; as in fact is the scene in 'Batman' where the Caped Crusader risks his own life to spare a mother duck and her ducklings.Warfare has changed a lot since the original 'Fail-Safe', but it remains a messy business; as 'Eye in the Sky' nerve-wrackingly demonstrates. One question though: for over a hundred years filmmakers have been employing technology we still have yet to catch up with. Do mechanical flies that can land and fold up their wings and provide perfect high definition pictures really exist yet in real life?"

" A COMPELLING WATCH !!
",0.4968,-0.9867,2019-10-27 00:00:00,8,"War on terror is a unique species. It involves multiple state actors spanning different continents stacked against an asymmetric enemy who could inflict disproportionate damage despite operating with minimal resources. With the advent of drone based warfare, this war has transcended the borders of sovereign nations and is conducted from remote locations spread across continents using satellite communication and drones which can deliver lethal firepower at selected locations under surveillance to eliminate enemy threats. Noted South African director Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) explores this scenario in an exciting thriller involving a drone based missile strike against the leaders of a terror outfit as they meet to plan their next offensive.The leaders of Al-Shabaab, a dreaded terror group are meeting in a safehouse in the suburbs of Nairobi to plan their next terrorist attack. The meeting includes two British nationals who were radicalised recently and are being actively pursued by the British intelligence. British military intelligence officer Colonel Katherine Powell (Dame Helen Mirren) is heading a remote team stationed in rural Sussex that is actively tracking the meeting to capture the militants. They are supported by ground forces of the Kenyan military intelligence in Nairobi as well as assistance from two teams of US military intelligence - one based out of Hawaii for remote facial recognition of human targets and another team in Nevada which is an air force base where pilots remotely operate drones to deliver missiles on targets across continents with precision.
Meanwhile, a Cabinet Committee on Defence consisting of the Attorney General, two ministers from the Government and Lieutenant General Frank Benson (Alan Rickman) oversees the operation live from Whitehall. The Cabinet Committee is empowered to authorise the capture of the militants after receiving a final confirmation of their identities. These multinational intelligence teams are using an unmanned aerial vehicle armed with missile and some miniaturised drones operated from close quarters for their surveillance of the militant safe-house.However, the preparation of two suicide bombers inside the safe-house for an imminent attack on some civilian targets escalates the immediacy and intensity of the mission and consequently, Katherine seeks to convert the mission objective from capturing the terrorists to terminating them. However, any missile strike would also involve collateral damage to lives and property in the area which happens to be a bustling suburb in a friendly country. What follows is an intense and nail-biting finale filled with frantic events and disparate discussions across these multiple teams involving intelligence agencies, defence forces as well as dilly-dallying political leadership which is keen on political expediency than protecting lives.The movie explores multiple contemporary themes through a taut narrative that keeps the viewer constantly at the edge of their seats. Besides being a tense thriller, the movie throws up multiple questions on the ideas including value of some lives over others, malleability of morality, acceptable levels of collateral damage, remote warfare which despite looking gamified could still present deep ethical dilemmas and political compulsions which could colour critical decisions of life & death. There are no easy answers to any of these questions and as a result, these questions would linger with the viewers to ponder long after they have watched the movie.The ensemble cast consisting of Dame Helen Mirren, late Alan Rickman, Aaron Paul and Barkhad Abdi provide excellent performances as the movie puts our moral compass on a see-saw ride. Despite being a war movie, this thriller is stands out as it abjures from the time tested tropes of the genre with most of the key players being far removed from ground zero and operating remotely through screens in conjunction to pull a virtual trigger. While this scenario means a war without its quintessential grime and blood, it still holds the potency of violence and emotional scarring. After (Tsotsi), this is easily the most accomplished offering from Gavin Hood, especially coming after misfires like X-Men Origins - Wolverine and Ender's Game."
" pure propaganda

" A superb film about morals, ethics and facing reality, disguised as a war film.
",-0.2263,-0.31,2019-09-18 00:00:00,10,"There are dozens of reviews, some very detailed or at least verbose, about this film; some very encompassing and thought provoking too. I write this focusing only on the purpose of the film, which from my point of view is about the moral standing of making a decision or avoiding it. The film forces the characters to face an apparent certainty of evil versus an apparent uncertainty of a much greater evil. In my not uneducated opinion, the future is never certain;thus in the dilemma (rather a trilemma) proposed by the film about deciding to take one life (uncertain, as even a high percentage of probability is never absolute) against the almost certain chance of saving many --and the third option, which will be most likely missed by the majoryty, simply not taking a decision; dithering endlesly and avoiding engagement and responsibility. The way of politicians.The rest, as you have surely been advised, is that the film is superbly directed, acted, cast, photographed, cut, assembled and is based on an excellent script. Not an action film but neither one that drags its feet through the plot. One to see and repeat, many times. An anthology piece."
" Evenly splits opinion, which is good

Halfway in, at that moment you suddenly remember you're in a chair watching a movie, I thought: the pacing is really fantastic. It was so tense I had to take a break, which you can do when you're watching on your own television.In handling such a fragile topic, it would be incredibly difficult to cover every angle and not leave a loop hole somewhere, but I found myself listening intellectually to the movie in a way that I really do. Given my loathing for the ignorance of the liberal left, it was with some credit that I had to acknowledge some of the arguments made. As such, this is a great movie to watch with intellectual friends."
" An attempt at exploring a worthwhile, deep, and philosophical question comes up short in its range and ambition
",0.34,-0.9397,2019-09-14 00:00:00,7,"I think this movie is worth a watch if caught on cable or basic cable. It's tense, thrilling, and it passes overall as decent.You got a situation occurring where the military needs to remove a target which is planning on carrying out a bombing. But a moral dilemma arises when the pilot in charge of taking out the enemy to negate the devastation sees an innocent civilian enter the destruction and fatality zone.There is sufficient philosophical depth to the movie. However, it comes up short in its targeted impact. Rather than explore and branch out further, it repeats the same profound question over and over, making one feel like it could have been edited down or cut shorter.It's not to say that the question isn't important, the movie isn't pretty good, or that the acting performances don't suffice. It just seems like a movie that could have been a lot better since it carried ambitious ideas with it. There is no impact here that makes it a classic, but some of the themes were well done.6.7/10"

The question is whether to take out the building and kill the girl or let the terrorists loose to prey on the rest of the population.The officers in charge of dropping the bomb are very squeamish about bombing the house due to the presence of the girl.COME ON PEOPLE!! IT IS WAR!! There will be collateral damage!! GET OVER IT. If you are an officer and you can't drop a bomb cause it Might kill some innocent people, you have no business working in the military.So the rest of the movie is following whether they will get approval for the mission, whether they will carry out the bombing, etc.Helen Mirren is excellent, as usual.

",-0.25,-0.3104,2019-06-28 00:00:00,7,"Nail-biting , tense and dark anti-war drama with magnificent acting by all-star-cast , acceptable production design and masterfully realized by the always original and professional Gavin Hood . British Army Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) wakes up early in the morning and hears that an undercover British/Kenyan agent has been killed by the Al-Shabaab terrorist group. Powell takes command of a mission to capture three of the ten highest-level Al-Shabaab leaders , who are meeting at a safe-house in Nairobi , and a British couple , among them . Soon their crew gets selected to execute a mission from the Army . From Northwood Headquarters-based fighter pilots turned drone pilots control the bloody terrorists by remote control for 12 hours a day . But these drone raids are different than first-person shooter video games , these are lethal machines to kill . Lt Steve Watts (Aaaron Paul) and Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox) are flying the U.S. drone the sky above Nairobi , they are who will ultimately pull the trigger . The risked mission feels wrong because the strikes are executed indiscriminately . But the high staff (Jeremy Northam , Alan Rickman , Laila Robins , Iain Glenn , Michael O'Keefe) are biginning to question the mission. And from somewhere in the U.S. Midwest to pull off the deadly execution . Do they carry out the assignment knowing there will be collateral damage? . They are fighting a war without end .If you never face your enemy, how can you face yourself . The commander is in England. The drone pilot is in America. The terrorist is in Kenya. And the authority to strike is up in the air. Welcome to the new front line. The longer you watch, the less clearly you see.
Exciting and enjoyable modern-war drama includes intriguing events , intelligent dialog , brilliant cinematography , appropriate sets and sensational performances .This nail-biting film contains thrills , suspense , intrigue , plot twists , and results a be pretty interesting . It was originally conceived as a tense as well as amazing thriller about the possibility of collateral damage at a case of terrorist slaughter . Â¨Eye in the skyÂ¨ bears remarkable resemblance to Â¨Good KillÂ¨ (2014) by Andrew Niccol with Ethan Hawke , January Jones and Bruce Greenwood , dealing with similar issue , but under another view-point. Across the movie results in a long debate among those in charge - in London there is Powell's commanding officer : Helen Mirren , Lt. General Frank Benson: Alan Rickman , a junior minister : Jeremy Northam and the British Attorney General ; the British Foreign Secretary is at a trade conference ; and the U.S. Secretary of State : Michael O'Keefe is in China - on whether they can proceed . All of them begin to question the ethics of this twisted mission , and the executioners also question their job as drone pilots . The premise is the following : if the kill mission is approved to cause an astonishing massacre and even things go wrong when in the ""kill zone"" happens the sudden appearance of a little girl selling bread . The cast is frankly well , giving nice performances such as : Helen Mirren , Aaron Paul , Alan Rickman , Phoebe Fox , Jeremy Northam , Michael O'Keefe , Laila Robins , Barkhad Abdi and Gavin Hood himself as Lieutenant Colonel Ed Walsh . The motion picture was well directed by Gavin Hood , he is a notorious secondary actor and filmmaker . As a director he has got a great number of hits ; such as : Tsotsi , Rendition , A reasonable man , Ender's Game , Official secrets and X-Men Origins: Wolverine . Rating : 7.5/10 . Above average , well worth seeing ."
" Gripping, Tense, Thought-Provoking - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
",0.3508,0.9635,2019-06-18 00:00:00,8,"One of the best films centered on the war against terrorism that integrates today's truly amazing military and intelligence technology (highlighting drones and the people who guide them to the identification and surveillance of targets, pinpoint accurate missles, and collateral damage assessments/estimating programs), and the moral, ethical, legal and political conflicts of making such decisions within the ""rules of engagement"" by military and political leaders (and their advisors), that are executed by military, intelligence and field personnel when there is a high-likelyhood of collateral damage.Film succeeds without being preachy or political, amazingly leaving the film goer to both live in the shoes of each character, and decide for themselves what they would do in the situation.It is superbly acted and directed, the movie paced well so that it thoroughly engrosses the viewer, and builds a nail-biting tension throughout the duration of the film.I imagine the majority of people who see this film will be both awed by some of the technology military/intelligence used today (although those used in the film may not actually be available, such as the flying beetle spy-cam) , and will have a greater appreciation for the complexities of decision-making involved, and its impact on both military personnel, politicians, and civilians.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
" It drags out too long for British a morality play
",0.1779,-0.9696,2019-05-19 00:00:00,6,It's well done but they drag this out for far too long with a long winded British morality play over one young girl. I get it but honestly it's just overly done and politically correct. Any sensible person would want to kill the bad peoples about to do the suicide bombings and who are likely guilty of the deaths of many many civilians. It's a no-brainer and it epitomises everything thing with the British in my opinion. The radical Islamists will see this as weak which it is.

Is it justifiable to launch a Drone strike to take out a Terrorist who might kill hundreds of innocent people, but at the same time kill an innocent girl? This movie mounts up the tension gradually, steadily and it maintains the uncertainty right up to the final conclusion. I loved watching this film.

Similarly, the accuracy of the advanced military technology in this film was also lauded. On that count, I will agree with these reviewers. I will also say that
Helen Mirren, whom plays a UK Intelligence Officer named Colonel Katherine Powell, does a good job in her acting.

Mirren puts on a military outfit and plays the role of Col. Katherine Powell, a military officer in command of an operation to capture terrorists in Kenya by using remote surveillance/drones.The movie starts with Col Powell (Helen Mirren) starting her day early, waking up just before her morning alarm kicks in. She turns on her computer and we are all provided with the news and urgent action required for her day.
Of course Col Power isn't alone- she is required to work and consult with many other characters within the film's duration including Lieutenant General Frank Benson (Alan Rickman) & Drone pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul from TV Series hit ""Breaking Bad"")Once the story is set up, the film provides great amounts of tension that never stops- the plot is a real draw card. Many of our main characters are required to discuss situations before further action can be conducted. Along with this, they have to deal with political and legal protocols, also discussing situations further with higher military leaders.The mission escalates when a young girl enters the kill zone, triggering an international dispute over the implications of modern warfare.Questions are now raised: can this situation now be classed as a ""capture"" or ""kill""? This film keeps you thinking as each new situation is updated. Many twists and turns are taken as the clock Ticks and Tock's. This can have the audience very tense (maybe even frustrated) throughout the film. I personally found myself sitting on the edge of my seat until the credits started to roll down the screen.The acting in Eye Of The Sky is superb, particularly from both Helen Miriam and Alan Rickman (who will be deeply missed as this is Alan Rickman's last performance)""In war, truth is the first casualty""9.0/10

" A tense and complex multi-threaded thriller, that deftly engages with the trials and tribulations of military engagement.
",0.4588,-0.8408,2018-09-16 00:00:00,8,"'Eye In The Sky', in a nutshell, is a honed-to-near-perfection example of how to tell a deeply intricate story with multiple players and narratives without losing or confusing those who are watching (even with all its military acronyms and terms). The film really stresses to its audience through careful camera-work, writing and dialogue how difficult the sorts of situations shown are. The editing is also very well done, and weaves the narrative together almost effortlessly, cutting between various viewpoints and characters in a way that demonstrates how world-spanning and desperately important this military operation is; again, all while keeping the audience focused on the tense action at hand. In addition, this is assisted largely by the actors (all of whom perform extremely well); particularly Aaron Paul, who is able to showcase his talents as the U.S. pilot being pushed to his moral limits.The main criticisms of this film are the pacing feeling uneven at times, the repetition of some shots and some of the CGI and other visual effects being noticeably distracting - as well as a few plot inconsistencies e.g. If allowing the terrorists to perform a suicide bomber attack means the ""good guys"" (the not-terrorists) win the so-called ""propaganda war"", wouldn't the missile strike allow the terrorists to win this so-called war, considering the possible civilian casualties of the local population and the death of the little girl, Alia - making locals and others perhaps feeling sympathetic towards the terrorists' cause?8/10 (Not quite 9/10 due to aforementioned issues)"

" The new front line
",0.0,0.9963,2018-08-16 00:00:00,8,"'Eye in the Sky's' main attraction was not for me the fascinating subject. It was not because of my love for the genre. It was because of the immensely talented cast, Helen Mirren, Alan Rickman, Barkhad Abdi and Aaron Paul have been great and more in other things, with my main reason for seeing 'Eye in the Sky' being Rickman in his final screen role before his ultimely death two years ago from pancreatic cancer (a loss still very deeply felt).While not a flawless film as such, and it has proven to be a film that has polarised viewers, 'Eye in the Sky' is truly impressive. There are many fine things and its best elements are superb. What some have found heavy handed, dull, dubious morally and one-sided, was to me a film that was gripping, tense and one that approached its subject matter intelligently and strived not to be too conventional or too simple. Can totally understand the polarisation though, it's a controversial subject in the first place and it was always going to be very hard for any film how to approach it, 'Eye in the Sky' does this well. Maybe the sentimentality towards the end is a touch too much and maybe the message was hammered home a little too thickly. Otherwise, there was nothing to fault 'Eye in the Sky'. Where it most excels is with the casting, with Helen Mirren being cast against type and doing so with authoritative steel. Aaron Paul is as great as he was in 'Breaking Bad' and Barkhad Abdi shows his versatility in a role different to the one he had in 'Captain Phillips'. Alan Rickman however gives the best performance, he is commanding and splendidly droll and there was an element of poignancy too knowing that it was his last performance.The film has nail-biting tension and suspense, unfolds deliberately but never dully (was actually on the edge of my seat the whole time) and was never hard to follow while not ever getting simplistic. It made a real effort to be balanced and handles a difficult subject with tact and intelligence, with it not overdoing or trivialising the full impact of the situation and bravely not falling into clichÃ©d genre tropes or providing easy or over-convenient answers. The main point and moral is generally made effectively. The script is thoughtful and well written and some of the film is also very heartfelt and brings a lump to the throat.It is a very well made film visually, having the right amount of grit and stylishness and capturing the claustrophobic confinement of the setting with authenticity. The direction is always at ease with the material and doesn't lose control or let go. Although, truly impressive. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

The main story is to demonstrate just how many radicalized Muslims are active in what is still thought of as a civilized country.....kenya. This film requires attention from the off and delivers through excellent direction and generally brilliant acting. It demonstrates that obstacles can be overcome but sometimes at a cost that isn't acceptable to everyone especially liberals most of whom need a wake up call as to whats occurring and the consequence of inaction.

And that woman UK cabinet minister who would rather blow up 50 people and almost certainly many more children in a shopping mall, than possibly kill a single child, who for some strange reason was quite happy to re-sell bread she'd already sold and taken the money for."

" Intention vs. reality

It's a discussion that won't happen in reality, of course, but the characters represent the different viewpoints in the drone killing process, and they do it very well. As another comment said: you have never seen a Skype call this gripping. This is great cinematography.Had it just been a discussion about the moral ambiguity of drone strikes, the movie would not have convinced. Where the movie shines, IMO, is its portrayal of uncertainty. Reality cannot be manipulated, and can certainly not be taken for granted. The outcome is not decided in the discussion, but afterwards, and we have to face it. That can make you reluctant to act to the point of cowardice, or all gung-ho, but it doesn't make a difference in the end.So, is there a happy ending? It doesn't matter. Live with the pain."
" Unrealistic, yet compelling
",0.2263,-0.9968,2018-07-21 00:00:00,8,"Although not very realistic, the film asks very compelling moral questions. A British Colonel (Helen Mirren) is placed in charge of ordering two American pilots to strike a house in Kenya filled with known terrorists. The problem comes in the face of an innocent girl who is selling bread to feed her family, and that there is at least ""a sixty percent chance"" she will be killed if the house is struck by a missile. 
 Because the terrorists have strapped themselves with bombs to commit an act of terrorism after leaving the house, a moral battle ensues. Some members of the British and American Governments and Militaries are supportive of striking the house, while others do not want to risk killing the little girl. Progressively, higher ups to the American Secretary of State and the Prime Minister are suggested to be consulted because no one knows what decision to make.
The British Colonel decides to manipulate ""kill ratio"" by having the possibility of the girl being killed as low as ""45%"" in one spot of the house. The strike is finally made and the girl is killed. The British Colonel disobeys the wishes of the British Government to have a British woman who married one of the terrorists captured, and orders the British woman in the house to be killed by another missile. 
There were a number of flaws in the movie. Firstly, a pilot would not be able to refuse an order to launch the missile. Secondly, the British Colonel is portrayed so evilly that she starts to side track the message of the movie. Lastly, nothing is mentioned about the fact that the Kenyan Army is on stand by and could easily have seized the vehicle that the terrorists were in when they left the house. 
Still, I have to say it was a good movie that asked tough questions. There is no doubt that these extremists are very bad people and a danger to all around. Yet, launching a missile is not an exact science. It cannot be predicted exactly how much damage will be caused. More importantly, these terrorists are operating around a lot of innocent people. It is a tragedy seeing innocent people killed in war, and never easy. 
Lastly, pilots have to deal with the realities. The two pilots were from opposite ends of the country, and had never participated in a combat mission. At the end, they both have only twelve hours to report back to duty. We never find out what happens after that, but either the pilots will just serve out their duties or grow from their experience. These terrorists are really bad and dangerous people, but lots of innocent people die wars. Hopefully, this movie will make people think seriously about reality and that can only help themselves grow in understanding what war is. It is the individual's choice how to respond."

",0.8519,-0.8286,2018-05-12 00:00:00,9,"A British military operation works with the U.S. and Kenya to prevent a suicide bombing by known terrorists in Nairobi. The efforts for a drone attack are thwarted as an innocent nearby civilian could possibly be killed in the attack.""Eye in the Sky"" is neither pro-war nor anti-war. Or maybe it could be called both. The various arguments on all sides are compelling and credible. The viewer feels as conflicted as most of the characters in the film.There are two characters who have no qualms on where they stand. On one side is a British military colonel (Helen Mirren) who believes the attack should go ahead regardless of civilian casualties. On the other side is a British political official (Monica Dolan) who believes there must be no risk at all of civilians being killed. (Interestingly, these characters never confront each other.) In between is everyone else in the military, political and legal spectrums who debate the dilemma: is it okay for a small number of innocents to be killed if it can prevent more innocents to be killed later on? Despite some extreme views, the viewer rarely if ever feels judgment toward any of the characters. Their humanness is real.As decisions must be made quickly due to time constraints, ""Eye in the Sky"" is a thriller. It could also be considered a suspense where one of the mysteries is who is right and who is wrong. Guy Hibbert's screenplay is very rich in its moral questions, making this film's story superior to the many other military films of recent years. It includes a relevant topic and very powerful dialogue. Even the details of fundamentalist bullies in Nairobi are subtle with their impact. It is also notable for showing a believable (and non-propagandistic) human side to those in the military who must make extremely difficult decisions.Director Gavin Hood keeps the tension alive with astute skill. The detailed use of advanced spying technology is also thrilling. In addition to Mirren and Dolan, the rest of the cast contribute greatly to this fine production especially the late, great Alan Rickman. In the final scene, he delivers a line that is the perfect conclusion for a great film.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Screenplay by Guy Hibbert"
" Felt like I was at work; don't need this stress during my off hours

Several distracting errors--Helen Mirren is too old to play an active duty colonel; a general uses a subordinate for a personal errand; multiple Muslim Brotherhood head coverings are worn in an area where they don't belong, the melodramatic, bawling airmen--caused me to drop my rating a little. I also would have liked to have seen a more conscious, thoughtful treatment of the issue of collateral damage and media exploitation thereof. It's the kind of movie that's worth one viewing."

" A real world application of the Trolley Problem humanises drone strikes
",-0.6369,-0.93,2018-02-25 00:00:00,7,"The Trolley Problem is a sociological experiment where an individual is asked how they would respond to an unfolding tragedy. In this, the individual is positioned in a place where they can see a tram or trolley travelling towards a person working on the line. The person will be killed, unless you pull a lever which will send the trolley onto another track. Simple choice, yeah? Now imagine that there are people on both tracks, and either your action or inaction will result in deaths. Action may result in fewer deaths than inaction, but ultimately it comes down to how you think you will deal with the guilt of being directly responsible for x deaths versus being indirectly responsible for y deaths.Eye in the sky cleverly uses this idea in a way which is much more plausible: A drone strike on a terrorist cell hiding in a densely populated area. Helen Mirren is in charge of an international anti-terrorism operation in possession of intelligence indicating the location of some high level targets. Drone pilots Aaron Paul and Phoebe Fox are to fire the missile which will neutralise these targets. As the senior pilot, Paul is the one who must pull the trigger; however the potential for collateral damage is too high for his liking. At the same time, politicians overseeing the operation lack the will to give an order they feel will come back on them if it is unsuccessful. What follows is a first ever look into how the drone strikes we read about in the news every other day may weigh on the consciences of those who pilot them, and the political fallout from their actions. While the tension mounts, and the probability of success versus failure is calculated, Mirren struggles to straddle the two worlds in which she must convince the military brass and politicians that the action is necessary; and at the same time convince the team she has authority over that it is vital. The end result is a film where nobody escapes the emotional engagement of such an event and all must resolve their actions in their own ways. This was Alan Rickman's last onscreen performance as Mirren's boss, acting as the conduit between the operations centre and the politicians as they sit at antique furnishings drinking tea and try to avoid making any decision which they may be held accountable for. Paul condenses the emotional range he showed in Breaking Bad to provide a compelling illustration of the conflict in the mind of the man with his finger on the trigger. Mirren's dogged determination and self assuredness is the balance between the two conflicts, trying not to let either one derail the operation. And all the while, the people walking the streets of Nairobi unaware that their fates are being decided by people in far off lands. Eye in the Sky is both original and captivating. This is a fantastic way to bring modern warfare, fought not on battlefields but from offices in various parts of the world connected by communications technologies, to the big screen with tension and emotion."
" Worthy but hugely disappointing
",-0.5844,-0.9332,2018-02-09 00:00:00,4,"Full credit to the film for tackling some of the moral dilemmas of modern warfare - unfortunately the good news ends there.
Poor direction leads to a film lacking in tension, with contrived scenes involving many stereotypical protagonists; so lacking in tension is this film that I went to do the washing up, that being a more gripping activity. The bad news does not stop there.
The casting is awful, Alan Rickman is a fine actor but falls completely flat as General Benson. Surprisingly given some of her previous roles Helen MIrren fails to inhabit the role of Colonel Powell - a more unlikely pair of high ranking military officers there has never been. If Britain's defence relies on these two officers then we are in big trouble. The politicians are laughable in their inability and the American soldiers mere facsimiles. 
Watch, but have low expectations."

This film dramatizes that problem brilliantly.Terrorists are preparing to strike, and we're all ready to drop a bomb on them when a sweet little girl from Central Casting wanders into the line of fire. Cue bickering, buck passing and nail biting suspense as the protagonists try to work out what to do. And this film is brilliant at asking: What would you do? Would you drop the bomb, trade one life for eighty and accept responsibility for killing an innocent? Would you wait, let the terrorists strike and cynically win the propaganda war? The most terrifying thing about this film are the implied questions. This is just a film, it says - the protagonists are idealized Hollywood characters who genuinely want to save lives. How much worse is it in the real world, where people aren't nearly as nice? How many times has this happened this month, this week, today? And - how long before the enemy gets hold of this sort of technology?A thought provoking, disturbing film that left me with the sense that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better."

The film is only two years old before the writing of this review. I live in Manchester and having seen the aftermath of a bomb aimed at children, the idea of sacrificing one to save more seemed a straightforward trade-off, with no element of "" shall I - shan't I ?"" The moral dilemma such as it was - was not discussed as such but much more shuttled around. The team couldn't decide or more likely was told by people they could not decide - so it was referred up. Past the attorney-general to the minister and possibly prime minister . Then across to more ministers of another country .

There was much space to make this movie more trustworthy by showing true ""emotions"" of the people which are in real life responsible for decision making, which in this movie shows a propaganda, that these people actually have feelings as you will find out by yourself, which I would say sides with fiction. The human factor of characters is forced to sky high, when in real life, there would be a lot of high fives and couple of pints of beer to celebrate."

I'm also glad to see that the drone pilots aren't 'cowboys'. They're real people, doing a job I can't possibly imagine having the strength or stomach to do. As demonstrated by the drone pilots here (Aaron Paul, Phoebe Fox), it's not just a job of 'kill or be killed'. There is a human, with human emotions behind that thing in the sky that can unleash Hellfire at the press of a button 10,000 miles away. That's a point this movie makes: there is a human side to every action taken.Speaking of unleashing Hellfire in the most humane way possible, Helen Mirren (I still love you), Ma'am, what Can I say?

This one is by far superior to the lot due to the strong cast. In this production, the setting is Somalia. Their ability to arrest was lost and now they are desperate to take out high level targets that include both US and British citizens. As a recruit puts on a vest, a little collateral damage girl, who thinks math is hard, is just outside.The film deals less with the moral issue than previous films. It is deemed okay to take life.

Unless someone paid one of those Indian / Bangladesh companies to down-vote it.Maybe because this is not your typical action movie which glorifies the war. It's a great drama, with a bit of dark humor.The only unfortunate thing is that in real-life, in 99% of operations the military doesn't really think too much. They just shoot and hope they've killed the targets, without even having a good Positive ID of the targets.Most of soldiers don't have much empathy, so they don't care about collateral damage. And media is controlled from the top, so military isn't really concerned about media either. But here and there some people do have consciousness, and for them making a decision is hard. This is not a Rambo / Commando / Platoon / Saving Private Ryan type of movie, but don't worry, there is enough of suspension. Highly recommended."
" Little character development but great acting and intriguing plot highlight suspenseful mission against terrorists
",0.4767,-0.9904,2017-09-29 00:00:00,7,"The three elements necessary for a good picture are a good plot, excellent acting and notable character development. Even if one of those elements is missing, a film can still garner quite respectable ratings. This is the case with Gavin Hood's thriller, Eye in the Sky, which I liken to Hitchcock's Rear Window in that most of the exciting action is viewed from a distance by the protagonists.A multinational force consisting primarily of Brits and Americans are one step ahead of a bunch of Al-Shabaab terrorists who are plotting another one of their nasty deeds in a safe house in Nairobi, Kenya. The action outside the compound is captured by a telescopic surveillance camera inside a drone which surreptitiously hovers over the bad guys high above in the atmosphere.The principal good guy is British Army Colonel Katherine Powell played by the magisterial, tough-as-nails thespian, Helen Mirren, who is bent on capturing a British national turned terrorist who is the significant other of one of the Al-Shabaab miscreants. Powell ends up depending on undercover Kenyan field agent Jama Farah (played by the reliable Barkhad Abdi of Captain Phillips fame) who employs two wonderful miniature surveillance drones in the form of a hummingbird and what appears to be some kind of flying insect.When Farah's ""insectothopter"" confirms that the terrorists are about to launch a suicide mission replete with suicide vests strapped to the bodies of their agents, Powell realizes this is no longer a ""capture"" mission but now decidedly one to ""kill."" In charge of the missile attached to the drone are US Air Force soldiers located at the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada.Right before the USAF team is about to blow the terrorists to kingdom come, a young girl sets up a small stall selling loaves of bread right outside the compound. A debate then ensues between Powell and some of the civilian government officials in the room as to whether they can legally launch the attack since the probability of the girl being killed is high.The late Alan Rickman (in his final role) is excellent as Lieutenant General Frank Benson who must contend with the warring factions who disagree completely as to whether the strike should be launched. It's almost comical in the way the buck is passed from one higher up to another including the British foreign secretary and the US Secretary of State (the contrast between the British and the Americans is quite clear with the Americans taking an aggressive posture toward dealing with the terrorists).Powell finally asks Sergeant Mushtaq Saddiq (Babou Ceesay), the Risk Assessment Officer, to fudge the statistics and give her an under 50% probability rating that the girl won't be killed. He reluctantly gives her the figures that she wants and they go ahead with the strike.SPOILERS AHEAD: In a realistic no-so-happy ending, the girl is killed along with the all the terrorists in the compound.In addition to the visuals of the terrorists observed from afar, there is some exciting footage of the Kenyan field agent, running from the terrorists after his cover is blown and then attempting to save the young girl by having another child buy the last of her bread so that she'll leave the area.Eye in the Sky has the two of the aforementioned three elements I alluded to before: excellent acting and a nifty plot which will keep you glued to your seat. There isn't much time for anything more so the characters (including Mirren's Powell) have virtually no back story and are not really fleshed out as multi-dimensional human beings. Still, this is a film which should definitely be on your list to see soon."

" What is the Value of One Life?
",0.34,-0.9407,2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)This movie is basically a debate about innocent casualties of war and ethical decisions. The story is based around a potential drone strike of the US's #2,3, & 5 most wanted terrorists in Kenya. Politicians and soldiers debate on launching a missile as there is one little girl selling bread next to the target structure. Some nifty spying has proof that these men are loading up weapons for a potential suicide mission and if they are bombed they'll potentially save 20-80 other innocent people. So do you launch the strike and risk killing the one girl selling bread? The debate uses the lion's share of the runtime. I felt the film to be unbelievable as the leaders and soldiers would have rules for these scenarios and certain solders would not have the reactions and take the actions they do in the movie. Putting that aside the movie was well-produced and tense but was also less about spying that I was lead to believe. Overall, it was a fake attempt to stir debate over the ethics of war which they cover points from both sides thoroughly."

So a task force assigned to capture terrorists in Kenya is headed up by Colonel Katherine Powell, played by the esteemed Helen Mirren, her current mission is to capture one of the countries most wanted terrorists, but matters take a turn for the worst when said terrorist and her cronies strap up for a suicide mission, soon capture turns to kill, but ethics come into play when a young girl strays into the blast zone. Overly political, it demonstrates the very fact that red tape rules the world, or at least our side of the world..., how many different people and officials had to be contacted and persuaded just to get clearance to complete a mission? I'm surprised the terrorists didn't attack whilst Colonel Powell and the gang were messing about.Also annoying is how the American pilot, Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) hesitates to take orders and follow his mission, really? Should a guy that emotional really be in charge of missiles? Eye in the Sky could be interpreted in several different ways, and no way is a wrong way, just depends on opinions and emotions..., I found it ridiculously annoying, frustrating and an actual send up of the American armed forces, because simply the way they dealt with the situation is pathetic, it's war, you do what you've got to do, Al-Shabaab have to be stopped..., so stop hesitating and giving the enemy every advantage. Slow, plodding and a waste of an hour and 40 minutes, overrated and just boring to be honest, there are other things you could watch, and other things you could do with your time."

In 2015 and 2016 there were 121.000 targets eliminated worldwide in the US drone program alone. Do anyone think that the foreign secretary, or any other minister or general for that matter, has to be asked for clarification every time? I have a feeling that this is just stupid propaganda, and if so it's really annoying to see good actors wasting their time on it."

",0.0,-0.9221,2017-07-23 00:00:00,6,"This is a gripping movie that is completely contrived and bares no connection to reality. I suppose it's an admirable effort to display the dilemma faced when killing terrorists with drones. The decisions that have to be made vis-a-vis civilians and collateral damage are played out here. Unfortunately, it's so phony at times. The technology is all wrong. The mini-drones don't exist and the real drones capabilities are misrepresented. The whole 'little girl selling bread' scenario that's central to the story certainly pulls the heart strings, except it's fake. The politicians are played like cartoon characters, whilst the military types don't ring true. You have to understand the military culture to know that a second lieutenant would not question the orders of a colonel, especially when ordered to 'engage'. Having said that, it kept me on the edge of my seat. I wanted to know the outcome."

I did some great sketching while listening to the movie and only momentarily watching to see something blow up!****SPOILERS*****and now the bad............You mean to tell me that if that was Osama Bin Laden's ass on radar they wouldn't give a damn about some black girl selling bread! I'm being honest here. No racial hatred in anyway. I'm just calling them as I see them and because this is in present day Somalia. They would of nuked that place twice!!! Yes it is sad the little girl selling bread died. However, I really doubt if she was the only person killed when you blast off 2 hell-fire missiles launched at a target full of suicide vests and CONFIRMED EXPLOSIVES. It's a wonder anything was left but a big hole where that village used to be. This movie is so boring it is like a day of your life at the office. Now I can't say that this is official procedure or not, but damn why are so many hands tossing the ball back and forth like this was an NBA game? No wonder governments suck and the Military gets the blame. So at the 15 minute mark I was bored and grabbed my sketch book. Only looking up and going backwards when something blew up.Watch a Tom Clancy movie or some 80's action movie.

The Americans as hard bitten and decisive and who would like to get back to their game of ping pong. Both points of view have some validity.While I am sure some of the technology portrayed had to be ""assumed"" as it is still secret - the plot stands up just fine.Worth a watch and more involved than the trailer."

" Man Made Gods.

As the movie progresses, its pace doesn't bomb down at super speeds at all either, it remains pretty sedate throughout, however, the tension Gavin Hood was building was quite solid.The entire movie is literally centered around one question, one situation. Is the life of one little girl, worth the possible death of tens of other civilians? Though there is a type of thinness to the plot, its importance however lends some credibility, and does very well in involving the viewer in said debacle.Bureaucracy. Cowardice. Selfishness. Hypocrisy. These are pertinent elements this movie explores at different depths, however, depicts quite boldly. Personally, the character that I found the most annoying - for a lack of a better term, though an effort to redeem him was attempted; LT General Frank Benson. His hypocrisy and selfishness is pretty damning.Academy Award Winner Helen Mirren's performance was meh, to OK. Probably not her fault though. Everybody else was as good as expected, however, a performance that definitely caught my eye, came from Babou Ceesay, the Risk Assessment Officer. His performance was so natural, and though he may be an ""unknown"", I believe he took this role, and made it the best it could be.Eye In the Sky is a very decent movie. Even with the slow-moving pace, the tension build up was well done. At points it also felt somewhat empty, and that can potentially lose the viewers interest. I only wish we could've been given some level of closure, to the possible consequences that followed Colonel Powell and LT General Benson's decision.7/10."
" Powerful, much-needed, immaculately-good storytelling and presentation
",0.4215,0.9609,2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"We do need films that present the dilemmas of high-tech warfare, and in particular the use of drones; and the Gavin Hood-Guy Hibbert offering that is ""Eye in the Sky"" is a spectacularly good piece of work that managed to open my eyes further, relatively well-versed in the realities of modern warfare as I nevertheless consider myself to be.As a traditional kind of a guy, I find it uncomfortable to hear of further cuts in the size of Britain's armed forces, and perplexed to see that this happens as my country's spending on defence keeps on rising. This film goes some way to allaying my fears, and accounting for what is happening. Just how many personnel do we need, if our forces are really as (amazingly) globally integrated as this film seems to suggest? And just how many when we have drones and other high-tech and can see what the enemy is doing down to the finest possible detail?Equally, fears about the cynicism of the military-industrial complex are also surprisingly well laid to rest here. A film that drafts in such classy actors renowned for high-integrity roles as Iain Glen, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam and the late and much-lamented Alan Rickman does so with every awareness that the audience will see the characters they play as worthy of respect. And that is so in this movie, where nobody is especially gung-ho, and everybody is at least somewhat swayed by even the loss of a single innocent life. The fact that no such tenderness, forethought or kindness is displayed by the suicide-bomber enemy armed to the teeth despite being headquartered in the midst of an otherwise poverty-stricken residential district of Nairobi is by no means a message that this film rams down its audience's throat, but this is not in fact the scandalous neglect it would seem to be. Far better that we arrive at this conclusion more gently and gradually by ourselves, through our own effort. For then that conclusion is all the stronger, and the condemnation all the greater...The bald truth here is that no politician, civil servant, soldier, airman or agent featured here is evil. None are trigger-happy. All bear the responsibility. All do the soul-searching. Certainly the military types strain at the leash more, are more willing than the civilians to contemplate some ""collateral damage"". Of course they are, that is why they wear the uniforms and not the rest of us! That is what we pay and train them to do! But now, more than ever before, there is reality to civilian control over the military, as the ministry people and politicians get to see strike operations carried out before their very eyes, get to make the calls. And they are not trained to take the incredibly tough decisions that those in uniform are. Hence the huge tension this film features, and the endless (and entirely understandable) desire to pass the buck up the chain of civilian command.Of course the film adds to all that the new, and weird, and psychologically daunting, job that is Reaper drone pilot. In this sphere life has already preceded art, but the art here is still well worth having. At the end of the film, the featured American airbase location offers a neat contrast between the row of anonymous-looking ground-based huts where the drone pilots sit and an aircraft of the old-fashioned type roaring into takeoff in the background, presumably with pilot in cockpit. Feet firmly on the ground, drone pilots take their decisions in colder blood, with better visuals and with none of the adrenaline and slight immunity to discomfort that the fear present in battle can offer. These ""pilots"" are told ""to go home"" at the end of the day, but to make sure they are back at their posts within 12 hours! No end-of-the-day banter and mutual backslapping or commiseration among like-minded folk for these guys, just an immediate need to readjust to life at home, far from the realities of the frontline, yet expected to be fully linked up with that reality in virtual terms.""Eye in the Sky"" also reminds us that we still experience a degree of helplessness without ""boots on the ground"", and in this sense the soldier heading the Kenyan forces standing ready looks convincing, as does the even-more-in-the-line-of-fire Jama Farah - a fine and hugely sympathetic role for ""Captain Phillips"" actor Barkhad Abdi.All of this needs to be thought on, and it certainly is in - and thanks to - this fine, very well-acted, intriguing and plausible-looking film, which has a very great deal going for it and can be much recommended."

The way these two, whose only task is to control the drone, including launch a missile if required, got to ask questions and stop the firing, is beyond me!

The horror is not that we have enemies that are trying to overthrow our government, the horror is in that human decision making can be irrational and one tiny mistake could set off a chain of events that could very well send the world into chaos.

But, and this is a big but... the real issue is nothing to do with religion or political ideas at all. The is well crafted but is many ways is, itself a propaganda fiction.First of all, how many people are killed by suicide bombers? Very few!Second, is there any real conflict between ordinary people who just want to eat, sleep, meet each other, get on, no matter what ideology they are indoctrinated with since birth? The film is just indoctrinating a false illusion that the west is under constant threat of 'an enemy' and to destroy that enemy we have to question 'collateral damage'. This is surface thinking. The real enemy is how one system collides with another. How hate and fear and thoughts of revenge or how conflict might solve this issue. In our 'dumbed down' world, I am sure this film has a place to up ideas, but it misses the bigger ideas of western superiority of poorly resourced countries exploiting religious themes against political and pyramid down structures of control and self serving ruling systems.For example, the western world is not interested in providing clean water in the poor countries, oil rich-many of them, or ensuring their systems of government are not ruthless families having a jolly at the expense of their populace: Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria... they just(WE) just want the oil!This film although a great film for looking at ethics, unfortunately, through it's device of considering the ethics of human love as opposed to human control, misses the mark. Should a surgeon under financial stress save this person or that one? It's a pity this film, which you should watch, unfortunately, took the current world 'globalisation', oil-seeking win-all resources idea conflicting with the religious lead mad people who really wish to usurp their ruthless western puppet dictators and controllers of oil, scenario as the stage on which to place the idea of human ethics against the idea of killing one to save more than one.Such ideas could have been scripted to be explored outside of the current International stage of politic, capitalist intent, religious power intent (both equal with their fundamental self-serving ideas of duping the people by systems which gather money to the few, and instead explored such ideas without supporting the false believes, mania, false news, propaganda, and the money trail which supported the making f this film in the first place.Just more dumbing down here dressed up as profound. If you want to do 'profound' best to do it outside of news-worthy and controlled propaganda. This film supports (innocently) a false idea of the world and adds to the ideas of a populace controlled by ruthless and faceless people. Great film which accomplishes nothing more than a continuation of the status Quo.mol smith"
" A 'war movie' for modern times
",-0.5994,0.6853,2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Not so long ago, all 'war movies' consisted of armies of infantry storming one beach/desert/jungle (delete as applicable). And, to be fair, there was little else that happened in a war. However, in today's high-tech times, 'war' can be fought from the 'comfort' of our own homes (okay, military bases, but how long before our soldiers are allowed to work from home?!). The story here goes that Britain has finally got the intel on a handful of its most wanted terrorists who are amassing in a house in a suburban African district. Should they just use an American-based 'drone' to wipe them out, or is the civilian casualty rate going to be too high? Helen Mirren thinks the former.The cast boasts Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul on the cast list (and, of course the last performance of Alan Rickman), but it's Mirren who steals the show. She seems to revel in playing the British colonel who is willing to 'take out' the extremists at all costs. Aaron Paul isn't in it as much as some people may hope, but does well with what he's given (which is basically spending the whole film sitting in a chair!). Alan Rickman is as awesome as ever and it's a shame we've lost him too early. Plus we do see what's happening 'on the ground' as it were and the film's unsung hero is a Somalian operative who seems to give a performance filled with more heart and feeling without uttering a word of English than most English-speaking actors.If you're hoping for an action-packed blast-a-thon of a movie then you'll be very disappointed here. Like I say, it's a war movie of our time. Some people may say that this is a fault, but basically the whole movie is people sitting around in offices debating the ethics of using technology in this way. The film is basically an 'ethics piece' which debates both sides of the argument. I have no problem with films like this, as long as they remain â€“ reasonably â€“ neutral and do their best to put both sides of the argument across. This one does this pretty well, however it does tend to lean towards 'nuking the site from obit' (ala Ellen Ripley) simply because its bigger stars seems to share the same opinion. However, there are plenty of moments where both sides of the argument make good points to support their opposing views.This film won't be for everyone. Like I say, you have to be in the mood for something which is slow (but without being boring) and filled with messages (without being preachy). It does show how 'war' has evolved to a PR machine as much as something that is simply fought using a bigger army than your opponent. If you're up for something a little more thought-provoking then definitely give this one a go."

COME BACK AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE. 'NUFF SAID?.Fairly good suspense but that's pretty much it. What I got from watching the film is probably not what the writers or director had in mind -- but I do not know that. For me the story reveals the problems faced by dithering national management. Compare and contrast the one extreme (that of so-called ""terrorists"") who do not value human life at all, with the extreme of the gutless hand-wringing and anxiety people experience when they are hired to do a job for which they are not suited and for which they have not been properly trained. Almost a re-play of the Hiroshima whining of the 1950's and 1960's. Here, we are supposed to identify with the little girl and her father because they were resisting the anti-female dogma of the local culture. Okay, we're all down with that. Next we see would-be armchair commandos doing their own dithering and hand wringing. If the locals knew the little girl learned how to read they probably would have tortured her to death anyway. But no, we see the weeping trigger jockeys in Nevada who drop drones on folks all day, everyday, but who are, on this day, all consumed with the Hula-Hoop Girl. For those who think the take-away is that drones are a bad thing, think again. Morality is never a numbers game: one life sacrificed versus many lives potentially saved. No, the real take-away here is much simpler: do your job or find another one. Again: the wages of dithering are depression. On the other hand, in most U.S. cities, the little girl would be arrested for not having a business license and a commercial baker's guild license."
" A good film that looks into the morality of war
",-0.25,0.9944,2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"After watching the film good kill a few years ago I thought that drone strike films didn't have anything interesting to show but I actually ended up quite liking eye in the sky. The premise of this film sees a military commander try to get approval to launch a drone strike even though there is a potential high risk of casualty. Helen mirren plays the military commander in this film and she is really good in this film, she has allot of edge to her character and you have sympathy because she is really put in a no win situation. Her character can come across as a bit antagonistic in this film but I take it as a leader under the stress of this highly volatile situation. Aaron Paul plays the drone controller in this film and he possibly gives his best ever performance in this film, considering he is just sat looking at a screen for the majority of the film he really delivers a strong performance that makes you care about his character and situation. This is the last ever live action performance from the amazing Alan rickman as he plays the military director In this film an like usual he is great in this film. He adds allot to his character in this film and his delivery of his lines sometimes sends chills down your spine. Barkhad Abdi from captain Phillips and Ian glen from game of thrones are both in this film in slightly smaller roles but they are both really good in this in their roles. The story has a really interesting take on digital warfare and you see the different points of views being displayed as you pretty much understand all of them. Unfortunately, this film has so much going on with different characters from all over the world that it can become a bit confusing and a bit too much to follow or care about. The script has some decent dramatic and humorous dialogue but none of it stands out as being very memorable and it doesn't help elevate any of the characters. The style of this film is a bit of an odd one, the last 20/30 minutes of this film is some of the most intense thrilling scenes I have seen in recent memory that had me biting my nails. But the first 30\45 minutes is some of the most boring cinema I have seen in recent memory an I swear I almost fell asleep. I ended up enjoying eye in the sky and think if you like some intense drone strike films then you should probably watch this film."

Given the fact that most order-following cowards sitting behind their super gaming consoles will ""prosecute"" (quite the euphemism for what is full-on MURDER) anyone who they're told to ""take out"" by their commander/owners at the drop of a pay check makes this movie misleading and very close to propaganda and indoctrination. Still, it does portray the unethical, narcissistic, morally vacant ""top brass"" somewhat accurately which gives it some merit. There are only two characters on the Western side in this movie who know the difference between what is morally Right and what is morally and ethically Wrong. While a third comes close, he/she doesn't have the conviction to say NO. You'll have to watch it for yourself and decide who I'm talking about. Calling someone a ""soldier"" who is not in actual combat (or the imminence of combat) where his/her life is being threatened by the enemy is language abuse and mind-control and the Alan Rickman character has no business make the claim he makes at the end.But the movie does show that murdering innocent women and children at the behest of psychopathic ""commanders"" will take it's toll on their souls. At least it should. No wonder so many order followers have PTSD and/or commit suicide. IF THEY EVER learn the difference between Right and Wrong and FINALLY decide to say NO when told to do something they know, in good conscience, is Wrong, then they will have taken their first right step forward in their spirits' evolution toward the higher planes of existence.

" Surprisingly suspenseful morality play
",0.5574,0.9871,2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"EYE IN THE SKY is an engaging morality play masquerading as a war thriller. The story is hot up to date and involves western participants battling Islamic extremism and also features surveillance and drone warfare. The film is much better than expected given the pedigree of the writer (who only worked in TV previously) and director (Gavin Hood, previously of ENDER'S GAME and X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, two films hardly setting the world on fire).The main problems with stories such as this is the political agenda behind them and EYE IN THE SKY is unsurprisingly heavy-handed in places. It's a liberal-left piece of propaganda decide to open the eyes of audience members, right wingers included, so some of the plot events play out largely as you'd expect with all of the requisite hand-wringing. There are certain endings that the writer would never dare to tackle so at times this feels like a typical BBC evening production despite attempts to keep you guessing.Nonetheless the direction is surprising efficient and for a film which mainly consists of characters sitting around in rooms and watching screens, it's often gripping with edge-of-the-seat suspense. The cast is also up to the job with the main roles perfectly picked. Helen Mirren has been playing caricatures for over a decade now (and I include her role in THE QUEEN in that category) so it's nice to see her getting to grips with something meatier. Iain Glen is typically excellent and Aaron Paul shines too. I was really pleased to see Barkhad Abdi excelling again a role very different from his one in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS. Best of the bunch is the scene-stealing Alan Rickman in his final screen performance, a much-missed actor reminding us of his continuing excellence."

It shows you how every life taken was a human, who lived, breathed, and was loved by others. Intentionally killing an innocent person for the greater good is a much bigger complication than most believe.Several scenes were incredibly beautiful, such as the terrorists, who are supposed to be degenerate scumbags, helping the girl.

Although the drone technology on display is up-to-date, the movie itself is redolent of American 'moral debate' films made after the Second World War. 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' is probably the most famous, but the one that came to mind when watching 'EYE IN THE SKY' was John Frankenheimer's equally taut 'SEVEN DAYS IN MAY about a military coup threatening the White House, in which the arguments pro and con are represented by characters played by Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. Here we have more participants, more points of view to take into account before Helen Mirren, in command of the military operation, can give the order to Aaron Paul for a lethal strike on an enemy.The issues are presented clearly, as is the jockeying for primacy. But the clarity is, perhaps deliberately, a distancing factor. It prevents emotional engagement, which the filmmakers then try to recover through non-stop music and heartbeat sound effects. The result is a bit of a muddle artistically. However, the movie is expertly filmed and edited. It is definitely worth seeing, not least because it is Alan Rickman's final screen performance, and he is absolutely brilliant ."

I didn't read the story-line at all. Though the story seems to get going a bit slow and rough - were you just try to figure out who is who, where is where and what is happening when - it grabs your attention as soon as the plot becomes clear. And it never let's go. You feel like you get to know all the people, you get to understand them, you start to like them. You cry when they cry... and why.This movie pulls you into the real, nasty and extreme decisions that sometimes have to be made. It show's how only a few people dare take that necessary but devilish decision to kill some, in order to save lots of people.I'm not a big fan of the military. Never was, never will. I'll never understand the need for some to overpower others, especially if they don't mind taking lives for it. In a perfect world, there should be no need for any kind of armed group. Police nor defense.But still... here we are. In an imperfect world, in which we, mankind, created the need for armies. And in this world there are man and woman that try to do whatever they can. Counting the costs, counting lives... balancing costs against lives...Eye in the sky showed me that those are not easily made decisions. And even though it might seem that they cause unnecessary death, they also prevent a lot of losses.I'm still not a fan of the military. But I sure do acknowledge the bravery of those who dare take that responsibility.I think this movie is brilliant because it shows the right and the wrong, especially in the person of colonel Powell (Helen Mirren). Impressive - very impressive."
