" Memento for the geriatric
",0.0,0.8519,2021-02-27 00:00:00,7,"Zev and Max are two elderly Jewish gentlemen spending their final years in a plush retirement home. Max is on a wheelchair, while Zev albeit mobile suffers from dementia. Just after Zev's wife death, Max reminds Zev of his pledge and sends him on his merry way with a letter of instructions, a wad of cash and a Greyhound ticket.It turns out, Max located an SS officer they had the misfortune to meet in Auschwitz and insists on Zev killing him. However, the nazi goes under a fake moniker shared by four men. Therefore Zev must travel from the closest to the furthest, to determine which one he's going to kill.As the joke goes, Zev would need a GPS for the elderly that not only tells him how to get somewhere, but also why. Luckily Zev can read Max's letter because he keeps forgetting why he's on the road. When Zev reaches his destination, a plot twist will make you reconsider what you thought you knew.The plot twist is of the hardly believable type, but it makes for a good show. Besides, both Plummer and Landau, as Zev and Max offer a great interpretation. The cinephiles will inevitably compare Remember to Memento, even if the latter was way more sophisticated.PS for those who complain about ""another movie on the Shoah... didn't you check the plot, before embarking on the viewing?"
" Max had a plan ...
",0.0,0.3387,2021-02-26 00:00:00,10,"This unusual film featuring two iconic actors in the twilight of their careers ends with a clever plot twist you will not see coming. It has something important to say about dementia, the Holocaust, revenge and justice in just 95 minutes. Martin Landau and Christopher Plummer have never been better."
" Powerful
",0.4215,0.6124,2021-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Christopher Plummer has just recently passed away and left many powerful movies. I personally enjoyed the movie as an old man with dementia still goes after his revenge. In this sense, revenge is such a strong emotion that even can defeat forgetting.
I can identify myself with Zev as the past continuously slips away. Find it hard to remember even a few years ago. Friendships are forgotten, and what is left behind is certain emotions with bad taste. Zev actually exemplifies the bliss of forgetting. A powerful script with a plot twist at the end."
" Just WOW
",0.6739,0.7064,2021-02-15 00:00:00,10,"I stumbled across this movie on prime tonight and of course Christopher Walken grabbed my attention, so settled in to watch not expecting more than solid acting perhaps.Considering the main characters are 90 somethings it feels relatively fast paced, the story takes grip and you are drawn into the plot. A revenge flic but with a difference.So many memorable films have tackled the holocaust story, but this film takes a different route. No real violence or harrowing scenes are needed to get you on board immediately, routing for the main character and the task he faces.Interestingly it also explores dementia and the very real issues that this condition brings. At times its sad and moving, without losing the real focus of the film.The last scenes are brilliant. It's not often you don't see the twist or at least feel the twist coming, but this final act blew me away. It left me genuinely moved and astonished at the quality of movie I had just viewed.The title Remember is perfect, a play on the dementia angle as well as a reminder that no generation should forget the atrocities of the 2nd World War.Amazing film that should be at the top if your viewing list."
" Remembering Christopher Plummer
",0.0,0.8879,2021-02-15 00:00:00,10,It is one of the great plot twists that ever made. I watched this movie because I have a huge crush on Christopher Plummer and his sudden passing was one of the hardest heartbreaks I have to face. My heart was happy seeing him playing the piano and I want to go inside the screen to hug this man while being confused about his mission. The movie is 10/10 I never see that scene coming. Extraordinary script!!!
" Extremely good performance by Plummer
",0.4927,0.9809,2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Christopher Plummer stars alongside Martin Landau in this extremely good film. Landau puts in a good and subdued performance which is just what his part needed, and he delivers. Christopher Plummer puts in an extremely good performance playing his character with Dementia to near perfection. The ending of the film is incredible in its story and is certainly helped in its set-up to that point in the film by the acting of Plummer and the direction of the film in general. There is an absolutely incredible scene near the middle of the film with Plummer & Dean Norris that is a masterful piece of performance & directing that will make film historians want to rewind and re-watch the scene, the scene is that good. It's almost hard to believe that Plummer was 85 years old when this extremely good film was released, and Plummer could somehow magically act better than most actors between the bottom of his chin to the tip of his nose; but of course we get to see his entire face. This film works so well in part because the cast is full of good actors that can perform with Plummer and the Director certainly was focused and envisioned."
" Multi-faceted and intriguing revenge thriller
",-0.4588,-0.5873,2021-02-07 00:00:00,10,"I cannot recommend this Hitchcockian thriller enough. I can only imagine how different it looks on a second viewing: initially, this appears to be a movie about revenge and mourning. Knowledge of the twist (one of the best twists I have seen in years by the way) turns this from a revenge thriller into a disturbing fable about identity, guilt. and self-loathing.But ignore my academic description-- this is amazing, especially the performance of the late great Christopher Plummer."
" It's a good movie with some not so good features
",0.7003,0.93,2021-01-25 00:00:00,7,"This movie is a drama.. and a capable one. The atmosphere is dense, the topic is obviously very serious, Christopher Plummer does a great job and eventhough there is no real action the movie has an ok flow to it. But.. Direction is flat and script is unimaginative. The plot is a bit unrealistic just to serve the storyline and the finale is somewhat hard to believe but still is a powerful moment. Overall enjoyable and I recommend to give it a watch but don't think about it too much afterwards"
" I wish I could watch this again without knowing how it ends!
",0.4574,0.8936,2021-01-13 00:00:00,10,"This is the first review I have left, having been a member of IMDB for a number of years, but was compelled to do so after watching 'Remember'.I cannot recall watching such a powerful film that I picked at random, with an Oscar creditable performance from Christopher Plummer.I cannot say too much more without risking a 'spoiler', but urge you to just watch this film if you are reading this."
" Simply excellent
",0.5719,0.9366,2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"I don't normally write reviews, but I urge everyone to watch this film. Great writing, great direction, and great acting by Christopher Plummer. I was gripped within 5 minutes, and you are immediately on the journey with him.A dementia patient on the hunt for a nazi war criminal, with only a note to help him remember his purpose.As good as memento. Seriously."

" A masterpiece

" Well constructed and unusual story with depth
",0.2732,0.9706,2020-08-22 00:00:00,10,I was pleasantly surprised by Remember. I came across it at an op shop and bought it on the strength of the well known lead. I wasn't disappointed. I feared something involving memory loss might be slow and heavily sentimental. Remember was cleverer than that. I couldn't fault the experience. I'm so glad this little gem didn't pass me by.
" Underrated good movie
",0.4404,0.8437,2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,Very good movie with an interesting plot with good acting
" good idea but the storytelling has a fundamental weak
",-0.4404,0.0516,2020-06-07 00:00:00,6,The weak of the plot is in the premise to the end. The end is made to surprise the viewer. However it should have change if the remembrance of the protagonist had convince him of the intrigue so to face his recrimination against his old-age home mate.
" All I can say is WOW
",0.6739,0.2189,2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,"I saw the ads for this movie and figured I'd give it a look see as I like the work of Christopher Plummer. I wasn't sure if I wanted to see a dark drama at the end of the night but got hopelessly drawn into it right from the start. The writing, the acting, the tension are truly phenomenal. Well worth the watch and mindblowing."

" WOW! Christopher Plummer at his Very Finest.
",0.7027,0.9709,2020-04-12 00:00:00,10,"I have always considered Christopher Plummer to be an excellent actor, but in Remember, he has absolutely outdone himself. Superb portrayal with the effects of dementia perfectly done with moments of clarity until the final realization of soul shattering truth. This one will stay with you."
" Perhaps a familiar sounding story, but a plot twist to remember.
",0.0,0.9339,2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"I felt it somehow both refreshing and nostalgic watching Christopher Plummer in this Holocaust survivor tale.
Plummer plays the character Zev Guttman, a dementia patient and recent widower who embarks on the task to find the Nazi who killed both his family, and his friends, at Auschwitz. They believe the man moved to America to escape and adopted a new name, stolen from a jewish victim.
A story which sounds familiar, yes, but it's suspenseful, well-acted and well written.
With no particular expectations for this movie I was surprised to be fully engaged with and taken along on this journey.
Don't be fooled though, it may just sound like yet another 'reminder' film of the Holocaust, or a simple tale of justice and but the final twists of the movie reveal far more than that, and it leaves a rather bitter after taste.
With a slightly less plausible second half and the lack of 'character development' I'd say there were way to improve Remember. But for the most part it's an interesting tale with a shocking plot twist that is less expected than with other movies of the same genre."
" 1 Hour Of Wondering For An End

",0.0,0.9477,2020-02-09 00:00:00,9,Plummer and Landau are just brilliant. And the script is supremely intelligent without a hint of pretense. A Sixth Sense twist as well. Loved it.
" Captivating
",0.0,0.9442,2020-01-27 00:00:00,8,A great movie and totally unexpected. Christopher Plummer is excellent. A great watch when your looking for something out of the blue. Enjoy
" Almost impossible to say something without spoiling
",0.0,0.9176,2020-01-25 00:00:00,9,"Well, the movie is quite long (not too much) and slow but you can follow without interruption.There are some very good actors, there cast is well assorted and there are beautiful landscapes, dialogues and scenes.Said that, I can only suggest to watch it. It's a sad story but unfortunately with a bold base of truth."
" the strengths are the weaknesses
",0.0516,0.9571,2019-12-25 00:00:00,9,Overall the movie is a good one but because he encounters all the people who the Hero has & each of them is representing a segment that was in WW2 it's not probable. Otherwise it's a great movie. Also the ending (specifically that the friend who sent him knew it all) was a bit improbable
" Nazi hunt by a dementing person.
",0.0,0.9709,2019-12-03 00:00:00,8,"First of all credits for Christopher Plummer. He did a really nice job with his performance. His simple but effective acting skills made this story more than enjoyable to watch. It's not a fast paced movie, wwhat could be normal as all the characters are eldery people, but it's for sure captivating enough. There is an unexpected twist to it what made this movie just better than a normal good movie. The dementia part is recognizable if you ever lived with somebody with that awful disease. I'm pretty sure there won't be much people who will dislike this movie."
" Hitting two birds with one bird
",0.0,0.8775,2019-11-13 00:00:00,9,What can I say about this film? It's an absolute modern masterpiece of art. Everyone's performance from Plummer's lead role to the nazi policeman are flawless. There are many tense scenes that make you stand up from your seat and Plummer is very convincing as an Alzheimer patient. The shocking ending is very surprising and unexpected which adds to the value of this film. Also if you have seen the film then you'll probably understand the title of my review.
" Remember
",0.0,-0.478,2019-10-16 00:00:00,6,"Dementia sufferer Plummer fulfils his promise to his friend Landau to seek out the Nazi from Auschwitz who killed both their families.Very much a case of the total not being the sum of its parts. Everyone in this, particular Plummer and Landau give impressive performances and some of the scenes (eg Plummer meeting one of the suspect's son) are extremely troubling and quite tense. Worth watching to be sure, although looking back, the tale itself is a real stretch and frankly hard to swallow, particularly the end."
" WOW!
",0.6239,0.3359,2019-10-14 00:00:00,10,"Plain and simply, wow! No one deserves to know a damn thing about this film (as in spoilers), so just watch it! Christopher Plummer is absolutely phenomenal in this. The film is not difficult to follow, but boy is the payoff big!"
" Brilliant in parts
",0.5859,0.6763,2019-09-17 00:00:00,7,"Worth your time to catch the brilliance of Plummer and Landau, two legends on display. Like Atom's films will do it drags at points, as if weighed down by some of the supporting cast. But, this isn't a big budget thriller, just an effective one. Most people will call the ending a shock and they are right."
" Mystery indeed
",0.0,0.8585,2019-08-12 00:00:00,7,Christopher plummer acting hasn't aged at all. This movie moves calmly towards one aggressive and jaw dropping mystery. The characters played by various actors feels like it was written for them. Enjoyed watching the movie!!
" ""once an executioner, always an executioner!""
",0.0,0.6542,2019-07-31 00:00:00,8,"Atom Egoyan's REMEMBER is a linear-structured retribution thriller revolving around an octogenarian Holocaust survivor Zev Guttman (Plummer), transiting North America to track down the murderer of his family in the Auschwitz concentration camp during the WWII, whose alleged name is Rudy Kurlander and Zev has four candidates on paper (a minor plot hole is that one of them arguably can be eliminated beforehand for his age, which could have saved Zev much trouble and legwork), and as far as to stretch the narrative length, it is always the last one on the list who turns out to be one he looks for, but Benjamin August's efficiently brilliant script strenuously paves for a last-minute bombshell to leave audience plumb slack-jawed.Zev has a condition, he is ailed by dementia, or Alzheimer's, so only with the aid of the written instructions from his fellow nursing home resident, the wheelchair-confined Max (Landau) - another surviving Jew who alleges that both him and Zev's families were dispatched at the hands of the said Rudy Kurlander, whose real names is Otto Wallisch, which leaves the ambulatory Zev the only one left to execute their revenge plan - a doddering Zev can sneaks out.."
" Glad didn't miss this thriller
",0.6052,0.8896,2019-07-23 00:00:00,8,It is 2019 now and watch back this 2015 movie. Luckily didn't miss it. Must watch until the end and always like the feeling that the story being told from the beginning until the end and get twisted. Amazing cast by the actor.
" You will always remember HOW AWFUL AND UNPREDICTABLE THIS FILM WAS!
",-0.6155,-0.9101,2019-07-05 00:00:00,1,"The main character has dementia, he forgot that he was a former nazi in Auschwitz, the guy Max who asks him to go on this mission remembers him and tricks him into believing they were both prisoners at the camp and their families were murdered sends him on a wild goose chase to find the man who killed their family, when really the main character is one of the men who killed Max's family, in the end he finds out what he did, he finds out he was a former Nazi, decides to kill himself and shoots the man who was also responsible for the death of Max's family, but honestly it was SO predictable I saw this happening from the very beginning.
Don't waste your time, boring predictable lame film."
" No Country for Old Nazis
",-0.296,0.89,2019-06-13 00:00:00,10,"Fascinating Holocaust revenge movie. Better title would be, 'No country for old Nazis.""Can't help but shout when the neo-Nazi with the German Shepherd get killed.A Jew turns into a Nazi; A Nazi turns into a Jew. Credibility of this plot is shaky on many levels, but who cares?This movie got a ten-minute ovation at its first screening plus many awards, but lost money at the box office. Seems like the movie-going milenials are more interested in CGI fiction-fantasy movies with robo-humans in the rapid-fire scene changes of a video game than gradually developing plots with good acting."
" ""Pianist"" meets ""Memento""
",0.0,0.9769,2019-05-28 00:00:00,9,"""The pianist"" meets ""Memento"" will be the perfect set of words to describe this film in short.
There has been an array of holocaust films for the last few years and this one holds a respectable place.
Zev(Plummer)plays an octogenarian patient suffering from dementia who seeks out to kill the person he believed responsible for the death of his family.
A man seeking out to avenge his family's death is a very common topic now a days but this one is quite a departure from those flicks in it's approach.Plummer has completely blown away me with his stupendous performance. It makes me compelled to watch IMDb trivia to see if he was really suffering from dementia but he wasn't. Vulnerable but unflinching, Plummer is absolute beauty.The brilliant photography and screenplay add to the merits of the film.Martin Landau is as usual perfect in his role.Atom Egyan is an excellent director and this time he delivers one of his most powerfully touching films. The film is slow but you will remain glued to it if you are a true film lover. Usually this old man's vengeance films are equipped with crisp action scenes and typical one liners but thus one is an exception. The climax is unexpected and jaw dropping and my advise is not to miss this one"
" Very well made and right on the target!
",0.3989,0.9432,2019-05-05 00:00:00,8,"Very intriguing movie which has an actor who is great at silent emotions. It was captivating till the end and totally unpredictable, at least for me. Didn't feel bored even one second during the film. Very well carried till the end and great twist in the end. Kudos to the lead actor and director!"
" Amazing!

" A slow walk towards hell
",-0.6808,0.639,2019-01-29 00:00:00,9,"Although it was quick and mercilessly painful the ending caught me with my pants all the way down. Plummer, 85, still shines as one of filmdom's ""go to"" actors.
The story's pages turn slow but build to a very momentous ending.
It belongs alongside ""Schindler's List"" and most Hitchcock masterpieces.
This film epitomizes the reason why we watch movies."
" True Gem
",0.4215,0.8934,2019-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Easily one of the best movies I seen in a long period. From the very first minute,all the way to the epic end,this is masterpiece. Plot,acting,whole idea of this movie is extraordinary. Unfortunally, heavily underrated in box offices without any reason,but this is something completely different."
" Wow
",0.5859,0.8809,2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"First off, we have Christopher Plummer and Martin Landau, so you know this will be worth watching regardless. Even so, this is something else.
Plummer plays Zev Guttman, an elderly man with dementia who seems to be working with his friend Max ( Landau ) to hunt down an Auschwitz guard who has heretofore escaped justice.
Zev's travels in search of this Nazi become an almost charming journey as he follows the instructions from Max in an almost Memento-like fashion, while each mis-identification is by turns poignant and brutal.
Then the denouement tears the ground from under you. Landau's final scene is perfect, combining the full import of what has happened in his expression; resolve and victory and loss and pain. It knocked the breath out of me like a punch to the gut.
And then, to cap it, a fade to the title:REMEMBER."
" A LITTLE MOVIE FULL OF SURPRISES!
",0.2942,0.9767,2018-12-31 00:00:00,10,"HI ELLIOT GJAZZ here.
Ever since watching with my Mum Dad and Sis way back in the 70's, I will never forget the first time I saw the Award Winning Mini Series HOLOCAUST 1978. This was a powerhouse of a TV Drama History Mini Series about the rise of Hitlers Germany and saw through the eyes of various Jewish and Nazi families.
I was in my late teens when watching it for the first time and remember being emotionally shocked and moved by it's contents, many times of which brought me to tears. If you haven't seen HOLOCAUST then you must endeavour to search this out and watch it. I have felt for many years that this TV FILM SERIES should be part of a school's ciricculum and watched by all school children of a certain age. Since HOLOCAUST I have seen many Disturbing Awful Horrendous and Moving stories on this subject matter
Namely films like THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK 1959 - JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG 1961 - PLAYING FOR TIME 1980 - SOPHIES CHOICE 1982 - THE GREY ZONE 2001 - LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL 1987 - THE PIANIST 2002 and off course SCHINDLER'S LIST 1993. REMEMBER is also a movie that has a connection to this subject matter. After just watching REMEMBER I was also moved and shocked, especially during the final scene. This was a little film not a blockbuster, nevertheless it was in my opinion up there with the greats. It was beautifully written and with many surprises along the way. Christopher Plummer as always was terrific and played his part to a T. This was an unusual little film and something I had not seen before. I definately would give it a second watch. Other actors in the film who I admire and have a great track record of work are MARTIN ( ED WOOD ) LANDAU - HERNZY ( THE BOYS OF ST. VINCENT ) CZERNY - BRUNO ( DOWNFALL ) GANZ - JURGEN ( DAS BOOT ) PROCHNOW and finally DEAN ( BREAKING BAD CLAWS ) NORRIS who was in one of my favourite scenes from this film. At first I thought the film was going in a certain direction then Bang it went in another and another and finally to that really surprising ending. Again I must say I thought the script was ace and kept you watching throughout. I hope you enjoy this little film as much as I did."
" world war II politics are messy
",-0.7506,0.4378,2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you that people who did horrible things to survive during the war should not still be held accountable. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" An extraordinary performance by an exceptional actor
",0.0,-0.6524,2018-10-21 00:00:00,10,"There are few movies that I tell everyone to watch, and this is one of them. Christopher Plummer should have received an Academy Award for his portrayal of this character. He could not have been more convincing if he tried and he completely reeled me in and wouldn't let me go. This movie tells a horrendous story in a gripping and enthralling manner that kept me glued to the screen until the very last second, at which point I almost vapor locked. This movie showed just how wonderful Christopher Plummer is at his craft and how well he gets his message across. This film contained everything from love to fear to regret to loss to revenge to abject disbelief. It gets it's point across at the very end by slapping you right in the face and makes you scream ""OH NOOOO!"" I don't care what any of the negative reviews say, this movie has an incredibly important message that I feel everyone needs to see. So grab a soda and a bowl of popcorn, settle in to your couch and get prepared for the experience of a lifetime."
" Great performance!

" Predictable plot twist in an okay movie
",0.2263,0.9829,2018-08-27 00:00:00,6,"I saw this movie because a friend of mine recommended it and said it was great...but my opinion was very different. Watching this movie, I could't help notice some similarities with 'Memento': the protagonist has memory issues, he writes himself so he can remember everytime he forgets what he's doing, he doesn't really know what he is doing, etc. But this is far from being great as 'Memento'.The main problem is that the plot is very simple. I'm not saying it isn't interesting, but the plot is simple enough to make me think: ""this can't just be all, there should be a plot twist somewhere"". So, yeah, for me the end was very predictable.Christophe Plommer is a great actor. I'm not saying otherwise, but his performance here is just okay. At least he can perform well as an amnesiac, who sometimes is scared, suspicious and intimidating.Visally, it isn't great neither. There where only a few shots I liked, with intense yellow colors spreading through the scene. But there wasn't a caracteristic style throughout the movie. At least it tried to make a few interesting sequences, zooming and moving slightly the camera.Finally, this movie isn't bad, but it isn't great neither."

The directing...Oscar worthy.
The writing...Oscar worthy.If you are going to make a complaint about anything, it might be the score, but even then the piano scenes make up for that and that was all Plummer.It was engrossing. It was vivid. It was oddly heartwarming and oddly comical in parts and that just worked to add realism to a film that dealt with some horrible and depressing themes...mass murder and dementia...with enough humor and heart to humanize it...which only adds to a sense of realism that makes it even more disturbingly vivid.And the twist at the end is just worth it, just keep on your toes, the hints to that twist are subtle, but there to be found.I don't think I've seen a movie this great in a very long time."

" A Very Sad Movie With A Strong Performance From Christopher Plummer And A Shocking End
",-0.4201,0.775,2018-08-13 00:00:00,5,"There's a lot about this movie to like. The story is compelling enough, and the acting by Christopher Plummer is superb. He plays Zev, a Holocaust survivor whose wife has just died. Zev is suffering from dementia and has trouble with short term memory - and can't even remember from day to day that his wife is no longer with him. As he sits shiva for his wife, Max - his friend from the nursing home (played by Martin Landau) - gives him a letter explaining to him that he has to search out the man responsible for their family's murders (because Max tells him they were both prisoners at Auschwitz.) The rest of the movie shows us Zev's journey all around North America trying to find the man. They know his name, they know that there are four possibilities. And Zev's mission is to take revenge.In many ways I found this a sad movie, watching Zev struggling with his failing memories and sent on this ridiculous cross-continent quest. Sadness was actually the emotion that permeated the whole thing for me. And there were parts of the story that didn't make a lot of sense. Many people take sympathy on Zev and seem to understand that he's confused - but no one bothers contacting the authorities to tell them that there's a confused and elderly man who looks like he needs help? And there was a single line in the movie that made me chuckle. At one point Zev's son, talking on the phone to someone, says that his dad's been missing for a week. A week? He's taken a train trip from New York to Cleveland. Then he has to travel to Canada, making a bus trip all the way to Hearst, Ontario - a long way north (about 1000 km north of Toronto). Then he travels by bus all the way from Hearst to Idaho, then to Reno, then to Lake Tahoe. But he's only been missing a week? That stretches the imagination.The ending (which I won't get into) comes as a shocker and the sheer unexpectedness of it makes the movie memorable. I certainly wasn't expecting it. And it's worth watching for Plummer's fantastic performance. But, to be perfectly honest, it's not a great movie - although I will confess that my wife thought more highly of it than I did. (5/10)"

Very unusual in the way it shows very elderly people from their point of view as they struggle to remain empowered despite age and dementia in a world that's a bit too fast and noisy. But this isn't some life affirming parable, it's a dark and tense thriller with a brutal truth at its heart. Christopher Plummer is mesmerising as Zev the man on a very grim mission. Brilliant!"

However, the originality and creativity of their unique storyline might put them into the same genre. Nevertheless, I preferred this one better. ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" did not resonate with me in the same way as this one did.The likelihood of this movie happened in real live might be plausible. That intrigues me. The settings and scenarios are well though out. The story itself is not much left to be elaborated. But its ending would surprise you. I am not too impressed by ""The Boy in the Striped Pajama"". The reason is from the start you already could tell how it would end . The tragedies were well written every step away. I would not suggest parents to let young kids to watch that movie because of its cruel ending. It might cause them nightmares. The ending of this movie is better plotted.

As someone born right after the end of WWII, I have always been very interested in that history. This is a very emotional movie as Christopher Plummer gives a tour de force performance as a WWII survivor of Auschwitz living in a ""senior living home"" who has developed dementia which is exacerbated after his wife dies. Supporting roles, especially Martin Landau as a fellow ""senior living home"" resident and Auschwitz survivor, are well cast and acted.

The problem is that Zef forgets his task every time he goes to sleep and must rely on a lengthy letter Max has composed with detailed instructions. The other issue is that there are multiple people who might be Kurlander.Not since Michael Caine played Harry Brown have senior vigilantes so terrorized the world of entertainment. You feel sorry for Zev and you have to wonder about the revenge and justice factor for people in their nineties. The film has a virtually clueless twist that it springs on you.

" Have you ever forgotten who you were?

But when I remember, which I eventually do, it catches up to me despite if it is good or bad. This film explores dementia but makes it very relatable in such a specific way. When something really bad happens to me and I go to sleep, I wake up and forget it took place until I remember it and my life is once again a living nightmare. How do we cope with the things we have done and the things we will do? I would like to believe our mistakes don't define us, but they do. This movie is profound. I honestly feel as if I lived this long just to see it. I can't believe these actors were and are still acting at such an extremely high level when this was filmed because Christopher Plummer and Martin Landau give the most compelling performances ever. Look at yourself. Never forget the pain, the love and the choices you have made and inflicted on others. If we could only be so fortunate everyday to wake up and pick and choose the things we want to live with. That isn't how dementia works though. Speaking as someone who has had a very tough time dealing with the past and how it has affected the present and future, this is a movie you need to see. It's so much more than a Holocaust film because of the intensity about what it says about our past. I was taken out of my mind seeing this film. Give yourself perspective and find out not just how this film turns out, but also what you can remember. It was said in ""Only the Brave"", ""What can you live with and what can you die without?"" This film aptly answers that question. I am still trying to decide for myself."

" Why wasn't Christopher Plummer nominated for an Academy Award for this film?
",0.5423,0.9827,2018-02-04 00:00:00,9,Both Christopher Plummer and Martin Landau are excellent actors (ML in the past tense since he passed away in the summer of 2017). It is amazing when men - particularly men of their age - can deliver such riveting performances. The story is spellbinding and the ending is very much a surprise. But it is the acting of the two gentlemen Plummer and Landau that should recommend this film to anyone who enjoys solid acting and complete immersion in their characters. A shout out also to Dean Norris for his 15 minutes or so of screen time. Very well acted.Anyone who has a smattering of knowledge of the Nazi concentration camps should appreciate this movie. And even those who don't should appreciate it for its excellent acting.
" The truth lies
",-0.128,-0.2236,2018-01-03 00:00:00,3,"Unless there is real evidence that some Nazis sought to escape their fate by posing as Jews who had been in concentration camps -- and I know of no such evidence -- this movie could easily be regarded as a whitewash of the Nazis. If you cannot believe people who say they are victims of the Nazis, can you believe anything about the Holocaust? I think not.Granted the movie is entertaining and the ending surprising, but a movie about these events which are so powerfully painful for so many which can be interpreted as a putdown of Holocaust remembrances and Jewish and others' sufferings cannot be viewed merely as entertainment or an opportunity for irony or some other theatrical mode. This movie is truly a disgrace. Yes, there are memories of the Holocaust which are inaccurate, others which are false intentionally, others which can be excused because of suffering and pain. But anything which seeks and succeeds in lying about the truth cannot be accepted."
" Polished and well acted, but with some lumps
",0.1406,0.7995,2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"To a certain extent, Remember is arguably Egoyan's best work since Ararat. Sure you can argue that Where the Truth Lies and Chloe were eroticly good B-movies, but they would never be mistaken for 'art'Remember sees Christopher Plummer as a 90 year old auwshwitz survivor, in a home and losing his facilities. He is told by a nurse (or reahter reminded) that his wife past away a couple months back, and so he sets out on a personal quest that he promised to undertake after she past, to find and kill the SS officer who murdered his family in the camp. Christopher Plummers damanaged, vulnerable and empathetic performance is something of a gem to find in an Egoyan film. He has always been a director with an eye towards cold and distant qualities in his characters. The tone is very mellow exept for one sequence where Breaking Bad's Dean Norris comes into the picture and fills the shoes of the late Maury Chakin, as the one sketchy and obnoxoius oaf in the Egoyan oeuve.
His performance as the square head county deputy with small man syndrome body languade feels more reminicent of the people in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. 
Plummer is strong enough to carry the movie though the minor contrivances, but the finale has a surprise twist that would have been more clever if it wasn't so shoehorned at the last minute."

" The acting of Mr. Plummer was absolutely brilliant.
",0.624,-0.9862,2017-08-11 00:00:00,7,"""Yes, I must finish. I must. After all, this is the man who killed our families.""""Remember"" is a movie you should know as little as possible about before watching it. So I'm not going to tell too much. This drama, which gradually turns into a thriller, shows how the 86-year-old Jewish man Zev (Christopher Plummer) is searching throughout America and Canada for a former Nazi officer who was a blockführer in Auschwitz. Zev's friend Max Rosenbaum (Martin Landau), who's staying in the same rest-house, discovered with the use of old documents that certain SS officers escaped by stealing the identity of killed Jews. Zev is being sent to seek a certain Rudy Kurlander and kill him. And this as a revenge because he's responsible for the death of Zev's and Max's family. Unfortunately, Zev has to be reminded of this because he's in an advanced stage of the dementing illness Alzheimer.The film thus shows mostly Zev searching for this person. Armed with a Glock and a handwritten letter from Max, he pays a visit to every Rudy Kurlander who's currently living in the U.S. And Canada. The letter is his guide because every time he awakes, he has no idea where he is and why he's there. He even forgets about the death of his wife Ruth. Hence the note with a pen on his arm to remind him to read the letter over and over again. ""Remember"" is captivating. ""Remember"" is thrilling. But ""Remember"" is also a moving movie. A film about people who have to deal with a trauma. How they need to carry an intense sadness. And the deeply rooted feelings of revenge. And I must say that the denouement is one that will stay in your mind for a long time. The only thing I could say was ""No way!"". It's been a long time since I couldn't predict the ending of a movie. It took me by surprise this time. Trust me, you'll remember the end forever.Needless to say that Christopher Plummer's acting was sublime. A scarred, elderly person who tries to do the job faultless as assigned to him. Zev isn't only scarred by his past, but also by the present because of the loss of someone dear and a memory-consuming disease. The desperation and helplessness Plummer displays is lifelike at times. The encounter with John Kurlander (Dean Norris who's the spitting image of Jack Nicholson) is a masterful scene with an excellent acting Plummer. You feel pity for Zev who suffers a moment of outright fear. After this scene the movie changes from a diligent search into a ruthless thriller.Despite his age, this star still knows to touch a nerve. More than when he played the well-known Captain von Trapp in ""The sound of Music"". A movie that makes me sick to my stomach as if I ate a poorly baked Wiener Schnitzel. The film is always shown on television around Christmas and New Years eve. Probably to worsen the hangover. Still find it strange I didn't recognize him immediately. The last time I saw Plummer was in ""The Forger"". But that part wasn't so memorable. Here the staggering and surprising end will leave a lasting impression. An absolute recommended movie.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"

" A Film With so Much Potential that Only Delivers a Twist
",0.0,0.5084,2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"The two most remarkable things about ""Remember"", the 2015 German- Canadian thriller starring Christopher Plummer as an elderly concentration camp survivor set on revenge, are the story's premise and Plummer's acting. Plummer deserves praise for his skillful portrayal of the role of Zev Gutman, a dementia patient who is manipulated into seeking revenge for the alleged murder of his loved ones at Auschwitz. Revenge in this case means murdering a ruthless former Blockführer named Otto Wallisch who apparently escaped to the United States after World War 2 by stealing a Holocaust victim's identity. ""Remember"" has an interesting premise with such great potential. The movie tells the story of an elderly man who struggles with memory loss but only remembers his need for revenge as a concentration camp survivor. Although ""Remember"" is primarily a thriller, there is plenty of golden irony and dark humor buried amidst all of the drama of the story. During one particularly morose scene, Gutman gets into a verbal and eventually a physical scuffle with the son of a Nazi who expressed his ardent support for Hitler's lost cause. The ensuing fight that follows itself is rife with dark humor. But it subliminally raises an important ethical question. Is it right to punish former Nazi's who have spent more time as ex-Nazi's than Nazi's? What about current supporters of the Nazi ideology who are far removed from the carnage of World War 2? At what point do such actions deserve to be forgiven rather than remembered and punished? Perhaps it depends on the individual. Unfortunately, the answers to these important questions are left for the audience to decide. The story progresses and eventually Gutman finds his target. This is the biggest problem with ""Remember"" given the inherent potential of the movie's premise to produce a film that was as profound as it was thrilling. Although Remember tells a compelling story and loosely touches on broader topics like aging and war crimes, any members of the audience looking for deeper meaning will surely be left disappointed. But the film is still worth a watch. The director of ""Remember"", Atom Egoyan is known for favoring twists as a tool to retroactively tell the story. This film is no exception. Although the film barely touches on the complex topics that it could have addressed, the film does entertain by ending with an unforeseen twist that changes the very nature of how one understands the film."

",0.0,0.9976,2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"In order to find this film in theaters, I had to go into the heart of a major metropolitan area (Minneapolis, MN) where they had a theater showing indie or niche movies. ""Remember"" couldn't be found in the traditional suburban multiplexes. Quite sad, considering that ""Remember"" is a true gem of a film.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on Zev Guttman (Christopher Plummer), a 90-year old Jewish man who lives in an assisted care facility and suffers from bouts of dementia. Zev is a Holocaust survivor, having experienced Auschwitz, and, with the help of facility friend Max Rosenbaum (Martin Landau), becomes resolved to track down the cell block guard at Auschwitz who killed both their families. This man is named Otto Wallisch, but likely goes by the moniker of Rudy Kurlander (a deceased Auschwitz victim). So, Zev manages to escape from his facility in order to track down the four Rudy Kurlander's that immigrated to the U.S. from Germany...knowing one of them will likely be his target.Because this film has almost exclusively an aged cast (with the exception of a brilliant turn from Dean Norris of Breaking Bad fame), it likely was a ""hard sell"" for theaters looking to pack in the teens. At 30 years old, the ""artsy"" theater I saw it in probably out-aged even myself by a good 20-25 years (or more). There are no whiz-bang action sequences or special effects.None of that matters, though, because ""Remember"" is absolutely perfect at what it does: Build characters and tell an emotional story. Thoughtful viewers will understand the emotions behind Zev's journey and, after going on this journey with him, will literally be on the edge of their seats as the climax of the film arrives. To say anything more would be to spoil the experience.""Remember"" is the type of movie that I wish more theaters would ""take a chance on"". Sure, it doesn't have the ""demographic appeal"", but it is just a wonderful film filled with emotion, intense character development, and even some suspense/mystery thrown in. I guess maybe I should just be thankful that ""art society"" theaters still existing that will indeed show these gems. Perhaps with the track record of A24 (this film's production company), future projects of theirs will be given wider releases and more press.I will be recommending ""Remember"" to any and all of my movie-watching friends who enjoy a thoughtful film experience. If word-of-mouth is what it takes to make a movie like this succeed, then word-of-mouth (and glowing yet deserved reviews like this one!) is what I will give it. Even if you have to venture outside your usual comfortable multiplex to see this one, do so confidently knowing that you'll be in for a real treat."

He escapes from hospital and travels across the country to search and kill the man who is responsible for the death of his family. The ending is heart breaking but turns the revenge story into something bigger. For Zev, a 90-year-old man with dementia, the journey helps him reveal his unusual past and instincts. The scene that he pisses out of fear and brutally kills John Kurlander (Dean Norris) and his dog Eva in self defense is terrific. The building of suspense is faultless - the conflict between Zev and John starts with his dog which barks endlessly and creates a tension to Zev and John until they confront and shoot. The scene is so good and can be used as textbook."
" Excellent, Excellent Movie

For whatever reason I can better stomach the poor movies of those genres. I almost feel like it's a duty to sniff them out and expose them if they exist. As for other genres; they must be good movies. I don't have the patience to sit through them if they're not. So, deciding to watch Remember was well outside of my element. I watched solely based upon the IMDb rating. I didn't even read the synopsis or the reviews--the rating was terrific so I watched.I'm glad I made that decision.The movie is akin to Memento in that the main character, Zev (Christopher Plummer), has dementia and he can't remember things yet he goes out on a quest to find the murderer of his family. It was almost sad at times watching this nonagenarian stumble about from place to place looking for the Nazi soldier responsible for killing his family in Auschwitz. It had my attention as it was because I was highly interested in knowing just what he would do once he found the 90-something-year-old Nazi. The ending will not disappoint you.This movie was very cleverly written and directed. Christopher Plummer did a fantastic job as a slow-witted aged hospital patient. Just the way the entire package was put together was tremendous. This was an excellent, excellent movie."
" A wonderful, thought provoking film
",0.4404,0.8907,2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"This film is very well cast, directed and acted with a very difficult and well written storyline.I wasn't expecting the level of pathos created by the film and was totally surprised by the ending. It's a story that I find myself thinking about the next day and I found myself obliged to write this review.The acting is outstanding and you feel real sympathy for the main character and find yourself rooting for his success. His motives are tragic and the success of the film is its ability to make you think about such a difficult theme. I became emotionally involved in the film and amazingly cried during it.I cannot recommend it highly enough."
