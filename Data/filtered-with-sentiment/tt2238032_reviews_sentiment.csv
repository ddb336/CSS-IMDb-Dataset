" More Fun than I'd Expected
",0.5563,0.9867,2021-02-01 00:00:00,8,"It looked like it was going to be a silly action comedy along the lines of Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon - and it was - and enjoyable as they all are, they are still silly - but there was an added element to the fun here because of all the locations you travel through. Jackie Chan starts out in Hong Kong and Johnny Knoxville starts out in Macau and is kidnapped to Russia. Chan hunts him down for reasons relevant to his story arc. And then they run from a Russian gang through Russia, then Mongolia, then China, all the while we get an interesting look at the life of the locals, their customs, and their festivals, which was a TON of fun. The side characters, especially the members of the Russian gang and the Hong Kong gang were actually quite fun and memorable. So yeah, better than I expected!"
" Starts OK, but then straight downhill by way of unchecked predictability
",0.5133,0.9611,2020-12-30 00:00:00,4,"I'm neither a big fan of Jackie Chan or Johnny Knoxville as people or actors, but I very strongly believe that casting is 99% of a movie. Most actors, including pretty much all of the highly acclaimed ones, actually have a very narrow range, but if they're cast in the right roles in the right movie, a sort of magic sometime occurs.""Skiptrace"" was coming off of streaming, and considering the basic plot, I thought it might work well with these actors. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment. It does start off quite promising, but the longer and longer it goes on while trying harder and harder to be ""likeable"", the less and less of a bite it has. By the end it is completely toothless.The most positive comment I can make about this film is that periodically some of it's scenery is spectacular. Otherwise, you've seen variations on this script so many times before that there's a good chance you're going to fast forward through it, turn it off, or fall asleep. The plot has zero originality here and the casting can't rescue it. ""Skiptrace"" is basically a slapstick yawnfest. I wish I had listened to my inner voice on this one."
" Funny and full of action. Very entertaining!
",0.7495,0.9528,2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,"Better than most of the repetitive Hollywood stuff -- fresher sense of humor. Kind of dumb, too, but without scenes not suitable for kids -- in an adventure that takes you to many interesting and beautiful places. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
" Better than I expected.
",0.4404,0.9509,2020-11-16 00:00:00,10,"Very enjoyable movie. Jackie Chan stayd an excellent actor with good action and comedy scenes, and Knoxville is definitely a good addition."
" Not the best but ok for a quick watch
",0.1571,0.9705,2020-10-12 00:00:00,6,"I'm not a real chan or knocksville fan in perse but this worked for me, Johnny does what does best act bad and getting bruised chan does his moves and still try's to understand American humor. Not the best chan movie but I think the 2 really seem to enjoy making this movie.
Not as good as the chan Wilson combo but ok, feels like a rush hour plot done over so nothing new here, but if nothing's on or you need a Netflix watch and have a laugh this is good."
" For Jackie & Eve
",0.0,0.634,2020-09-22 00:00:00,5,"For Jackie and all his super moves. For Eve and her double d's. Both make this a fun way to waste your time, have a few laughs and also wonder why did they spend all that money on this stupid film."
" Cool
",0.3182,0.926,2020-09-12 00:00:00,7,"Just love Jackie chan he's such a good actor
Loved this film full of everything, humor action thriller and suspense"
" Chan chopping away
",0.0,0.9091,2019-12-26 00:00:00,6,"I liked this Chan vehicle better than most, mainly because Chan always remains endearing, but also because of the high quality locales for this odd-couple road trip.The central conceit is pretty standard: to solve the crime of his former partner's death, Chan has to enlist the help of con-man Connor Watts (Knoxville), and the odd couple bumble across the world fighting a persistent Russian strongwoman and assorted Hong Kong mafia to uncover the evil guy behind the scenes.The latter is a 'surprise' reveal, although one can guess early on given the importance given to his former buddy's daughter.The set pieces in the film are beautiful, the mud fights, houses-on-stilts fights and factory floor fights are fun, while the humor sometimes misses the mark, but often hits it pretty well - from used car salesmen in Mongolia to awkward situations with bowling balls.I was entertained for an hour and a half+ (brevity is a virtue in such flicks), and give it a strong 6 because it fulfills the premise that such no-pretense films should."
" Don't skip this.
",0.0,0.8977,2019-10-25 00:00:00,8,A really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously with a pair of great leads with super chemistry.Just swell for a Friday night in with the girls.
" Long winded
",0.0,0.3832,2019-08-15 00:00:00,4,"The storyline is long winded. There were parts in the film which were not needed, and could have been taken out to make the film shorter.There were scenes in the movie which were so cheesy, it bordered on cringe worthy.The special effects were horrendous and scenes where you can tell they cut and added in, very poor cinography in parts.The movie did deliver some laugh out loud moments, however because the film was long winded, I found myself losing interest towards the last 30 minutes.Fit enough to watch as a one off, however would not watch again.Not Jackie's best film."
" Happy I finally watched this movie!
",0.6114,0.9527,2019-07-15 00:00:00,10,Based on the ratings of this movie one would judge but would also miss out on the opportunity to enjoy a good laugh!
" Love
",0.6369,0.9753,2019-07-13 00:00:00,10,I love this movie. It is true to both Jackie Chan's and Jonny Knoxville's artforms and mediums. I love this movie. Is it an Oscar winning film piece no. But if you're looking for a solid action comedy you will not be wasting your time. I kinda want a second one. It's kinda like rush hour meets supercool. I dig it 10/10 because it was funny and I liked it.
" Jackie Chan's action movies, the plot is naive.
",-0.2732,-0.5859,2019-02-19 00:00:00,4,"Jackie Chan's action movies, routine fighting, watching more jokes is really not enough. And now many special effects have been added, slowly losing the flavor. The plot of this film is really confused, there are many inexplicable scenes and plots, the whole film procrastinates, the plot is naive."
" Jue di tao wang: I enjoyed it despite it's best efforts
",-0.0176,0.992,2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Okay bear with me on this one, this is one of those films that I enjoyed yet I fully understand an argument against me doing so.You see Netflix decided to make another buddy duo with Jackie Chan, he's done great work with Chris Tucker, Owen Wilson and even Lee Evans before so it made sense. There is just something about him that screams buddy movie, so here they pair him with Johnny Knoxville which has been met with a very mixed reception. Do they have chemistry? I personally thought so.It tells a rather generic action movie story (As they tend to do) with lashings of comedy to keep it interesting and in my view both of these leads excel in that department. They both have great natural comedic timing despite not really coming from that background, Chan from martial arts and Knoxville from.......stunts?An old school buddy movie with over the top sequences, the odd couple dynamic and Chan's trademark comedy stunts/fight scenes I was enthralled but the films flaws are overwhelming.Many jokes miss their mark, some moments seem awkward, the fights are considerably tamer than we're used to (Chan's age no doubt a factor), and the whole thing has a really PG vibe to it. Truth be told the movie has a lot more flaws than I'm letting on but it's qualities outweigh them and I found it an enjoyable, fun, throwback movie.I understand the criticism, but I really enjoyed it and would love a sequel.The Good:Leads do a great jobEve Torres is ageing like a fine wineSome funny momentsAwesome buddy movie dynamicThe Bad:Littered with flaws in pretty much every area of the filmPG cuteness hurts the film"
" Same old Jackie Chan
",0.0,0.9345,2018-08-28 00:00:00,5,"After reviewing the Foreigner I decided to watch another Jackie Chan movie. Skiptrace stars Jackie Chan and Johnny Knoxville who decide to take down Chinese criminals. If this plot seems familiar its because it is and you know how its going to start and end. This is every Jackie Chan movie you know from Rush Hour to Shanghai Noon. But in every Jackie Chan movie that I watch I can't help but appreciate the guy. I like his fighting style that he uses in his movies to make it funny and also action packed. Here's the thing about Jackie Chan. He can be in the worst movie and still make it fun to watch. I say that now, but until then I'm sticking to this theory. Johnny Knoxville plays your typical Owen Wilson and Chris tucker type of roll. He's something we see in a few of Jackie Chan's movies, but he didn't annoy me and didn't get under my skin at all. Johnny Knoxville is best known for his Jackass movies, so all this you see going on is a typical day in the life of Johnny Knoxville. And when Jackie Chan and Johnny Knoxville team up you I knew immediately what's going down to the basic formula that's in most of Jackie Chan's movies. I found myself enjoying this despite the negative reviews it got, but until the end I found anti climatic and let down because I was expecting a really good follow up with some action packed fighting at the end like the Rush Hour movies and Shanghai Noon, but it was a waste. Overall, I will say this is something to watch on Netflix when its rainy and you have nothing else to do. Maybe watch on the weekend with some friends while eating popcorn."
" Two of the best clowns in the industry together at last
",0.6369,0.9409,2018-05-04 00:00:00,8,"I really have no idea why there are so many nay sayers here criticising this film?! This is pure fun and old school action, the sort of unimportant movie that is pure enjoyment. Jackie and Johnny together at last! In a stress free and brilliantly choreographed film these guys shine. Stunts that are brilliant and locations that are wonderful. Seriously, what's the problem?!If you cannot enjoy this film there's something wrong with you! Stick to the regular takes itself seriously bs because these guys are very clever and a lot of fun...
ENJOY!!!"
" Jackie Chan at his worst. Bad movie-
",-0.8225,0.2353,2018-04-04 00:00:00,1,"Very slow, boring. Don't waste your time. It is not a movie. Crap crap..."
" I dont really like it.
",-0.3241,-0.2302,2018-01-27 00:00:00,4,"I think, one of the worse camera positioning and movements ever. Firstly I could not see it, annoyed me very much."
" I don't hop so fast
",0.0,-0.9822,2017-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Hong Kong detective Bennie Chan (Jackie Chan) is on administrative leave. He was attempting to bring down businessman Victor Wong, but his efforts proved futile and had a lot of collateral damage. Circumstances lead him to American Connor Watts (Johnny Knoxville) who has a smart phone that can only be opened by the head of the crime syndicate. Chan travels to Russia to escort Watts back, who doesn't really want to come back. They become chased by the law, the Hong Kong gangsters and occasional Russian which gives us a couple of conflicts between Chan and Eve Torres. Keep in mind this is a Chan movie.The film starts out like a westernized grindhouse, but with Chan's slapstick fighting style, it can only be a crime action comedy. The Adele number was priceless.Guide: No F-words, sex, or nudity. Killing, no gore. A ""Wikipedia"" of Chinese ceremonies and customs."
" Better than most of Jackie's recent stuff
",0.4404,0.9806,2017-09-06 00:00:00,6,"SKIPTRACE is a film that comes as a surprise to me. First off, whilst not being a great movie, it's the first Jackie Chan film I've seen in yonks that feels like one of his older classics. It's a light and breezy production, full of silly comedy and action, and a story that keeps on moving so that it never feels dull despite the predictability of the thing. It was made by Renny Harlin, whose career has been less than illustrious as of late, but it's one of his better showings.The plot sees Chan and sidekick Johnny Knoxville (riffing on his LAST STAND persona, and not irritating at all) teaming up to tackle a criminal mastermind. Most of the film feels like a travelogue as they head through Mongolia and China on their way to Hong Kong. There's plenty of action, including a stand-out fight early on in a Russian doll factory (!) which is just like a classic scene from one of Jackie's '80s movies. Hong Kong cinema lovers will enjoy the turns from Eric Tsang, Michael Wong, and a cameoing Richard Ng, and in the end this is a harmless enough slice of entertainment that's a bit better than most of Jackie's recent stuff."
" Good separation of comedy and action
",0.6597,0.9163,2017-08-29 00:00:00,7,"In this comedy/action film, Jackie Chan shows us once again how much of a bad*ss he is. Johnny Knoxville is his lesser partner, mostly there for comedic purpose. Throughout this film, Johnny's character switches from thanking Jackie's character, to wanting to desert him in the middle of nowhere. The movie is very back and forth with no solid standpoint of whether or not the two are truly partners/friends or not. On the other hand, the comedy in this movie does truly make you laugh. What I enjoyed about it is how everyone laughs at different moments throughout this film. It shows that the creators were able to satisfy all people's comedic desires. Overall, this movie is funny, action- packed, but very shaky in terms of characters' feelings towards each other."
" as always Jackie delivers
",0.0,0.8348,2017-08-14 00:00:00,8,"REVIEW - SKIPTRACE hmmmm a weird nane for a film especially a Jackie Chan film but as always Jackie delivers with fights, stunts, humour and this time actually a good buddy crime story with a little twist that even I wasn't expecting at the end.Thoroughly enjoyed this film as I always do with Jackie Chan films so if you've got nothing better to do and what some enjoyable movie watching then you won't go far wrong with Jackie Chan."
" Funny, lots of action, interesting story line.
",0.6808,0.9783,2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"I first heard of Jackie Chan from the Rush Hour movies. Since then I've watched him come out in a few good American movies. Not every movie can become a hit. SkipTrace falls in between his best and those that were not so good. The story line is not original, but how can it be with so many cop movies and TV shows out today, but bring in a little Jackie Chan humor and it becomes a decent movie. It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, but who needs Hollywood when you have Jackie. Johnny Knoxville is not known for being a great actor, but his performance is good enough to help move the movie along. I was never bored watching this movie, it kept my interest from beginning to end. That's all you can ask from some movies. I was surprised it was only released in Italy? and not the US? Was it straight to DVD after Italy? Doesn't matter, if you can't find anything on TV to watch, check out this movie it will help waste a couple hours of you life."
" Not One of Jackie Chan's Better Efforts
",0.4404,-0.8221,2017-02-17 00:00:00,4,"After watching his partner being killed a Hong Kong detective named ""Bennie Chan"" (Jackie Chan) vows to take care of the detective's daughter, ""Samantha Bai"" (Bingbing Fan) while at the same time pursuing the drug lord who killed him. This pursuit leads him to a con-man by the name of ""Connor Watts"" (Johnny Knoxville) who is wanted by both the Russian mafia and the same Chinese drug kingpin responsible for the death of Inspector Chan's partner. Unfortunately, Connor has no intention of testifying against anyone and desires above everything else to escape detection and apprehension by all of the parties involved. To make matters worse, the Russians have sent their best assassin named ""Dasha"" (Eve Torres) to bring back Connor which creates even more problems for the two of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I didn't think this was one of better Jackie Chan movies. For starters, I didn't particularly care for the casting of Eve Torres as a Russian gangster. It was just too odd. Likewise, the partnership between Jackie Chan and Johnny Knoxville seemed equally artificial and ingenuine. That being said, I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly below average."
" Typical Harlin fare thats not typical of Jackie's best.
",0.6369,0.9923,2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"I have to say, I was shocked to see Renny Harlin's name pop up in the credits, who's best film was, in my opinion, Cliffhanger but is also know for Die Hard 2, Long Kiss Goodnight and Deep Blue Sea. He didn't quit after those, but slowly slipped off the big name notice board in recent years, hence my shock seeing him directing Chan the Man. I can't help but think Harlin received a lot of creative input from Chan and co, having a strong, distinct Hong Kong cinema feel. However the opening credits is something Guy Ritchie would do, thinking it's more of a show-off instead of suiting the film. I found that a lot with Harlin's films. I grew up watching Jackie Chan films and I absolutely idolise the man, but, I hate to say it, Jackie appears to lose some of his magic in Rush Hour 3 back in 2007, though Forbidden Kingdom and the rebooted Karate Kid restored my faith, and I have yet to see Police Story 2013. He's not as fast as he once was, he's 62 now, but even though a lot of the action sequences here are copies from a lot of his previous movies, he's still Jackie Chan and delivers the goods. It's a clichéd storyline of struck-off cop Chan hooking up with gambler low-life, Knoxville in order to catch the bad guy. Johnny Knoxville another man who's not afraid to perform his own stunts. He's come a long way since performing daring pranks in Jackass to now sharing the screen with greats like Dwayne Johnson, Schwarzenegger and now Jackie. I wonder if he looks back thinking ""wow"" there I was drinking Preston's sweat and boom! The action isn't always consistent going from being quite impressive to being mediocre and poor, again, a trait I associate with Harlin. The fight sequences mimic a lot of Jackie's slapstick fighting style. But the acting overall is quite terrible, Knoxville being the only believable character here. His wit is actually quite funny and refreshing. There's some nice touches and funny scenes like the bowling alley and Jackie singing Adele! But a lot of it is silly and totally out of sync, rushing around faster than Jackie's stunt team. however looked like a lot of fun. It even includes Jackie's trademark outtakes at the end credits. Unfortunately, Harlin doesn't let me down and does what is expected, a film with some great ideas and potential that fails to impress. Not even Jackie Chan's masterful Kung Fu and Knoxville's quick-fire sarcasm can save this film. Still, it's entertaining, brainless fun but certainly not one of Jackie's best, ever.
