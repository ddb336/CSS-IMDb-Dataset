" Looks only interesting in the trailer
",0.4019,-0.9266,2021-03-16 00:00:00,5,"I have no idea what to think about this movie. I have no idea, what the message is supposed to be. Maybe that the weird girls might just not be cool & nerdy but just weird and vanishing after leaving clues, but not expecting to be found is a bit ... weird. Margo is made look bad anyway. She doesn't seem to care about her family, at least her parents, she doesn't care about her friends and an unfaithful boyfriend is enough to make her flee her life and try find herself elsewhere."
" Good effort, bad movie
",-0.1531,-0.926,2021-03-11 00:00:00,3,"The movie is a good story and is the strongest point of it, is one best smaller of the writer of other books of the same genre, I like the cast a lot except the main character, this movie was a great tried but they did it badly, the movie a not a lot accurate to the book, and also the production is worst, but is from those bad movies that at list you need to see once in your life is not bad for regret to see it but you will not feel satisfied."

" a great movie but didnt like the ending
",-0.0297,0.9787,2020-12-17 00:00:00,7,"I read the book before watching the movie and the team did a great work in bringing it to life. However, the ending wasn't as great as the book, it was a disappointment. They completely changed the ending and there wasn't any closure for the rest of her friends. Lacey ,for example, after going all this way to see her and making sure margo is okay didnt get the chance to let her know that she didnt know about jase and becca. Q ,who was madly in love with her since they were kids, just walked away and it seemed like he moved on with his life normally. He no longer saw her as a miracle as stated throughout the movie and now he thinks his friends are his miracle, just like that."

" Its a terrific movie, but just needs a little more.
",0.2617,0.9772,2020-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Another teenage movie i adored, second from Before i fall
This movie had a great feel/tone about it, it really shows how a important a girl can really be in your life, even it that means being a trouble maker, Cara Delevigne and Nat Wolf were they main who had an exellent presence in the movie, but i felt the ending could of been more suiting, i feel like it was rushed, also the first part where Margo leaves was just a bit too quick, on the side note, other actors who deserve more reconition in this was always Beautiful Halston Sage and cool Austin Abrams, this movie is a real teenage lover!
Thank you, Jay"

" Paper Towns
",0.0,0.9992,2020-06-17 00:00:00,5,"I had heard the title of this film a couple of times, this was the film that made a big star of the former British model, who went on to star in Suicide Squad, and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, so I was intrigued to know what it was about, directed by Jake Schreier (Robot & Frank). Basically, in Orlando, Florida, Quentin ""Q"" Jacobsen (Nat Wolff) lives across the street from Margo Roth Spiegelman (Cara Delevingne). She has been his friend since childhood, but nine years have passed and they have drifted apart, after they discovered the corpse of local lawyer Robert Joyner (Lane Lovegrove), who killed himself after his divorce. Unbeknownst to Margo, Quentin has been infatuated with her since they became neighbours. After reaching adolescence, Margo is one of the most popular girls in Jefferson Park High School, with an adventurous reputation. In contrast, Quentin is kind and unassertive, but not very popular. His friends are other outcasts, Benjamin ""Ben"" Starling (Austin Abrams), and Marcus ""Radar"" Lincoln (Justice Smith). One night, Margo climbs through Quentin's window and asks him to help her on an all-night revenge trip. She has discovered her boyfriend, Jason ""Jase"" Worthington (Griffin Freeman), was unfaithful with one of her friends, Rebecca ""Becca"" Arrington (Caitlin Carver). After buying supplies, they pull humiliating pranks on Jason and Rebecca, and their friends, including Margo's best friend, Lacey Pemberton (Halston Sage), who she accuses of not telling her about the affair (actually Lacey was unaware). The event gives Quentin hope that he finally has a chance with Margo to get closer and form a relationship. He begins to learn how to assert himself and to take chances. The next day, Margo does not come to school. A few days pass, some think she has gone missing, others assume she left for an undisclosed location. Margo's parents will not report her missing to the police as she has run away from home repeatedly before, they believe their daughter will eventually return. Seeing a recently attached Woody Guthrie poster on her wall, Quentin realises it is a clue deliberately left by Margo as to where she has gone. Quentin bribes Margo's sister Ruthie (Meg Crosbie) so that he, Benjamin, and Marcus can enter Margo's bedroom and search for other clues. Quentin, Benjamin, and Marcus attend a party at Jason's house, where Lacey argues with Rebecca over her betrayal of Margo with Jason and leaves in disgust. Quentin finds Lacey in a bathroom, getting to know her, he sees that beneath her superficial exterior, she is intelligent and compassionate, and they become friends. After finding more clues, Quentin starts to put them together and is led with his friends to an old gift store. They find a map that Margo used, it turns out she has been hiding in Agloe, a paper town (a settlement that appears on map but do not actually exist) located in New York state. Quentin and his friends, including Marcus's girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair), begin a road trip, using Quentin's car, to find Margo. They have two days and are hoping to be home in time for their prom after they find her. They bond on the way, Benjamin and Lacey are going to the prom together, while Marcus and Angela grow closer and consummate their relationship. When they do not find Margo where they expect her to be, Quentin stays while the others drive back home. Quentin sits waiting for some time, until he decides to walk back to town. Suddenly, he sees Margo on the street, she is surprised he came all the way to find her. Quentin admits his affection for her, but Margo does not feel the same way as he does. She ran away from home to escape her dysfunctional family life, and to figure out who she is. She left the clues to let Quentin know that she is safe, not to invite him to follow her. Margo remains in Agloe, while Quentin books a bus ticket home, but they share a farewell kiss. Returning to Orlando, Quentin enjoys the company of his friends at the prom. After graduation, he continues spending time with them throughout the summer before they all leave for college. Also starring Cara Buono as Mrs. Jacobsen, Josiah Cerio as Young Quentin, Hannah Alligood as Young Margo, Susan Macke Miller as Mrs. Spiegelman, Tom Hillmann as Mr. Spiegelman, and Stevie Ray Dallimore as Mr. Jacobsen. Delevingne, with her big eyebrows and foxy eye, is beautiful and fun as the free-spirited independent girl, but the film belongs much more to Wolff who is terrific as the nerdy neighbour with a crush on her, the supporting cast of friends are all likeable as well. This works well as a coming-of-age story and an insight into the experiences of teenage life, including love, friendship and relationships, the following clues and road trip element moves it along nicely, the locations are good looking, and it is funny enough, an enjoyable romantic mystery comedy-drama. Worth watching!"
" Mediocre at best
",0.6369,-0.3182,2020-05-17 00:00:00,5,This is every trope all the other movies already have. It's for from new and jut plain boring at the point.
" Beautifully done
",0.5719,0.9696,2020-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Great story of LOVE as a teenager when you just trying to find your foot.
Acting were smooth and faultless.. I can see anyone doing it better.
it has thrilling and exciting line of events waiting for what gonna happen which gonna keep you interested.
The ending was perfect and sad.. which is hard to combine..
But in reality it is true reflection of life and really the concept of Love and ""the ONE"" . I think they were very good in their surgery to that concept .
Am not sure why some people rating it so low? but again could be not everyone taste"
" Paper Towns
",0.0,0.9517,2020-03-02 00:00:00,4,"Quentin (Nat Wolff) has had a crush on Margo (Cara Delevingne) ever since she moved opposite his home years ago. They were childhood friends but have drifted apart in high school.Quentin is viewed as a nerd and Margo is a 'it' girl that everyone likes her flirty free spirited attitude.A few weeks before prom night. Margo suddenly calls on Quentin to help her prank some people who have wronged her. After that Margo disappears and Quentin who once again pines for her follows some obscure clues to track her down.Paper Towns soon becomes a teen road movie but it never amounts to much of interest with a muddled message at the end.Based on a Young Adult book, teenagers might get a life message from it. I found it too derivative of other similarly themed movies. It would had helped if this had more originality, zest and fun."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.0451,2020-01-18 00:00:00,2,I watched this movie a while ago however I remember been really excited for its release. When I finally got round to watching it I found it boring and the ending was frustrating. Don't waste your time watching this.
" Cara Devilgne(?) Shines Bright!
",0.4926,0.9309,2019-11-30 00:00:00,6,"I really liked the main actresses performance. She definitely is not one of the most attractive actresses out there. I know about her only because she visits a bar I used to go to. And then I heard she's a cool fashion model coming from a prestigious family. Then she was in Suicide Squad, but very unmemorable and not entertaining at all.But boy does she shine in this! She plays a role that unpredictable. She's hot, she's pretty, she's popular. But she's different. She's weird in all the right ways. Her life won't go the same as ours. It might be exhausting and weird to the rest of us, but we would all sit and behold it's glory. I'm not sure if her real life is like that, but it's the character I was most interested in.The film is about a boy and girl who were close when they were young, and drift apart. Their lives come together again in high school, and she later runs away, leaving clues for the boy to solve to find her.It's not a great movie, but Cara shines. I'd like to see her in larger movies playing a similar role. Really entertaining character and performance.6 stars"

",0.0,0.9363,2019-07-10 00:00:00,10,"I will not talk about the directing or the acting level, but about the script itself. The movie is based upon the real world, where we have to lose, and things not go the way we expect them to, but life still goes on. The main character didn't get to be with the love of his life, he didn't feel sorry for himself, he moved his life on (which I find greatly done), the best friends got split up after high school, and this is life, made of level after level, and each time we cross a level, we tend to leave people behind us, break some bonds and reshape ourselves for a better tomorrow. This is movie is a fake storytelling, it portrays life the way it is and tends to be more often. (Great writing there)."

" Better Than Average Coming of Age - Paper Towns
",0.4404,0.9327,2019-07-05 00:00:00,6,"John Green is an excellent writer; he really gets into characterizations. We may like or dislike a few of his characters, including Margo, but we certainly will not forget them anytime soon. Some reviewers compare this film to the shallow ""Breakfast Club"", which had better music, and better actors, but just was not as sincere as this film. Coming of age is just like this film at times; hit and miss. Margo is selfish and self-absorbed. Quintin is every nerd trying to be cool who ever was in Hollywood film, but eventually, he has to be what he really is; a conservative young man with a future. I enjoyed the film, even though I could not relate to it on a personal basis."
" It's all fake
",-0.4767,-0.0005,2019-04-07 00:00:00,6,"A movie adaptation of a teen romance/mystery novel that I once considered reading. I might not bother now. I like the movie, but it felt hollow and pointless by the end.Quentin Jacobsen has been in love with the curious and eccentric Margo Roth Spiegelman since they met at children. Once the girl next door, they drifted apart as teenagers and she became an enigma. Then one night she whisks him away on an impromptu revenge mission which liberates his mind from his awkward demeanor. She doesn't show up at school the next day, or the day after that, or ever again.Confused and hurt, and puzzled by her parents lack of interest in finding her, Quentin recruits his friends to follow the cryptic clues left behind by Margo and work out just where she disappeared to, eventually placing their bets on a ""Paper Town"" - a fake town put on a map to protect against illegal copying. It's one of those ""it's not the destination, it's the journey"" movies. With only days left before high school is over, Quentin's time with his friends adds up to more than the pay-off of finding Margo.I was left cold by the resolution, but Paper Towns features believable teen characters (mostly played by ACTUAL teenagers) and realistic dialogue. Most of these kinds of movies and TV shows often have actors in their late 20s talking like 100-year-old longshoreman trying to pass off as minors. For once, Paper Towns felt legit. There's also a decent sense of mystery and atmosphere surrounding Margo's disappearance."
" Very enjoyable teen movie
",0.4927,0.8932,2019-02-02 00:00:00,8,"I don't quite get all the negative reviews here. I'm married father of two pre-teens and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I recognized myself a lot in the teenage search for meaning and desire to see people for more than they actually are. Characters are quite relatable and it's an overall a pleasure to watch, with a gentle sprinkle of comedy."
" Snooze fest despite standout Nat Wolff
",0.0,0.1059,2018-12-25 00:00:00,1,"Nat Wolff is excellent but he can't carry this boring storyline alone. I honestly said out loud when the movie was over "" what did I just watch?"""

" 1000 Miles to Friendzone
",0.0,0.4939,2018-09-30 00:00:00,5,"Paper Towns is the very ordinary. The cinematography is very standard for this kind of film, the acting uninspired and easy, the script predictable and full of stereotypes, and comedy inserted into every few minutes of the film to distract from the cookie-cutter dialogue. Nat Wolff cannot carry a film on his own, and his character is uninteresting and unrelatable. Cara Delevinge does not shine either."

" Some may dislike how the Movie ends, it tells us not to imagining someone and that it can sometimes be destructive
",-0.765,0.9986,2018-07-25 00:00:00,8,"This Movie is inappropriate for young children as it had a bit of strong language, talk of sex and doing inappropriate things, kissing and it also has a bit of nudity and Underage drinking. sneaking out at night and doing things that can get you into trouble And it also had a little bit of bullying in, there was also a scene were there was a car accident which was a little intense. And in another scene there was a dead body and a gun that was fired in another scene. I feel like they rushed this Movie. I don t think They had enough time to let things unravel like they did in the book, I mean, of course they couldn't have included every little detail or else the Movie would be way too long. But, i think that they could have done a better job, by taking things slow and gradually moving the story line along instead of pushing through everything. 
The characters, not seem to have jobs, but they seem to have an endless supply of money. I would of liked to see how they get it because that the only thing that wasn't believable. I didn't like the parents they were clueless, and unhelpful.I like how close it stayed to the book it had little changes. In the book Margo and Quentin go to Sea World but in the Movie it was only mentioned. In a YouTube video which John was in he said 'no one was anxious to pay Sea World for the chance to give them good publicity."" We do get some scenes from the book but some charterers were left out of a few scenes.I loved the music that was used and the voice over at the start, I think that younger Quentin and Margo were cute and they acted well. I also like that Ansel Elgort, the actor who played Gus in the fault in our stars was in this Movie but he was only in it for a few seconds.I really liked the scenery and I liked the abandoned building scene that scene was a little intense but then it turned funny. I think it has good acting and casting. I like how it creatures and encourages living in the present and nurturing close friendships. I like Quentin's friends, Radar and Ben, they were are loyal, honest, and kind, and they helped him even when they thought that his plan was a little crazy. I liked the road-trip and shopping scene I found it relatable and really funny. The scene with Ben and Radar in the car was funny. I really liked Ben and Radar they were really funny and I would of like to be there friends. But I would of liked it more if Ben and Radar had a bit more screen-time. I think that Radar was a cutie and he looked cute with his glasses. And I liked it when Radar did the voice impressions. I shipped Radar and Angela and also Quentin and MargoI think Some may dislike how the Movie ends, but that is the point of the story. The story tells us that not imagining someone complexly can sometimes be destructive."
" WHERE'S MARGO?
",0.0,0.8555,2018-07-05 00:00:00,5,"Margo (Cara Delevingne) moves into town and Quentin (Nat Wolff) becomes obsessed with her being a free spirit, always going on adventures, and never plucking her eyebrows. The obsession goes from childhood through their senior year in High School. Margo loves mystery and after a night of mischief with Quentin, she disappears. Following clues left by the mysterious Margo, Quentin goes to look for her taking along a posse.Margo's adventures were better stated than enacted. The film had a lot of boring scenes, coupled with indie scenes that attempt to be cute and deep both. Margo has those deep memorable lines like, ""We bring the rain and not the scattered showers."" The target audience of the film is the class of 2015 with a theme of ""making memories"" and not a memorable movie.

" With a few tweaks, it could've been a great little gem of a teen movie
",0.6249,0.9986,2018-06-20 00:00:00,6,"First time I saw Paper Towns, I loved it; bought the blu-ray, and everything was good with the world. But soon enough I got rid of it. I've recently rebought it, but it's still not perfect.The story focuses on Q, whose been madly in love with his childhood friend Margo, who over the years, has grown further and further away from him, and has gone on a number of wild adventures of her own. After one night of pranking her former friends, Margo seems to have disappeared for good, and Q is on a journey with his friends radar and Ben to find her.To put it simply, Nat Wolff and Cara Delevigne are the best part of this film. Their interactions just feel so real to me. I'd put the last scene of them together on par with something like the ending of 'Her', it's so simply but so effective. Also, like 'Her', it has a bittersweet-ish ending, which I enjoy. I also really like some of the main music in this movie. ""Forget the Miracle ever happened"" is a great theme and I love how throughout the film there's different styles of it to fit the mood.The film is competently made, with a lot of decent pacing. The acting is also good. The problem with the story is sadly a large chunk of the middle act; it feels so slow. The middle is of course Q and his friends travelling across the country to find Margo, but there's not enough interesting stuff happening to keep me that engaged. Also I just don't think the main three actors have that great of a chemistry together. Something feels out of place, and it's either of those. There's humour littered throughout and I enjoy the character Ben getting 'the girl of his dreams', and I think the relationship between Radar and his girlfriend Angela is cute. I just think the movie picks up WAY more when Q and Margo reunite at the end, and it's really a shame cause the other characters could have been developed a bit more. Also, some of the music they chose for this film is annoying, and it made the film come across like some wannabe art-house project.Overall, it's a good movie, and even though there are STILL parts I skip past because of the awkwardness and straight up cringe of them, mainly, the Ben character, there are a lot of scenes that still make it a fun watch. I'm giving it a 7 out of 10"

" Absolutely awful.
",-0.5095,-0.8581,2018-04-08 00:00:00,1,"I read the book before it was a movie. I liked it at the time and I also liked John Green. But now, I think John Green is such an overrated author. I was excited for the movie, the book was exciting with a highly disappointing ending.
Well, the movie has the number one spot as the worst movie I've ever seen. It wouldn't have been hard to follow the book, but they even decided to change some things, make it worse and add useless scenes that didn't even need to be there.
The worst of all was the scene where they sang the Pokémon theme. It was quite an insult to the TV show which will always be one of my favourites, first season only. It was so, so cringey I had to shut my eyes, look away and apologise to myself for spending even a minute watching this movie.
I think the only good thing about this movie is that the casting was pretty good, however, Cara cannot act at all in my opinion so it was hard to watch, or even try to get lost in the story when you're constantly reminded that it's acting and that it's horrible."
" An adorable yet depressing coming of age flick...
",0.1531,-0.4961,2018-03-29 00:00:00,6,"I've decided to give this film a 6 for effort that was put forth. For the fantastic soundtrack. That's about it.
While I haven't read the book, I have the feeling this is one of those cases that the book is better than the film.
It's not that it was so awful, or that I hated it... but I do hate it when both the antagonist and protagonist are terribly unlikeable. By the end, I was too through with both Quentin and Margo, if that says anything. 
Again, not a terrible one overall...
It's just that, I wish we could've gotten to know Angela much more... I guess I was expecting to have my heart beautifully ripped out The Fault In Our Stars style but this one leaves you feeling a little cheated...
Basically I'm saying, it's not the worst but it certainly isn't the best either..."
" Paper Towns is the equivalent of eating vanilla ice cream.
",0.0,0.9992,2018-02-27 00:00:00,6,"It's nice to look at but ultimately leaves a bland aftertaste. I'm not the biggest fan of young adult romance films, and it seems to be a popular trend as of late...so here we have another one. Quentin has been in love with Margo since they were young kids cycling around the neighbourhood. They grew apart, she recruits him for a prank-filled night, she leaves and it's up to Quentin to follow the breadcrumbs that leads to her heart. Such romance. Such cuteness. Such niceness. It's a nice story surrounded by nice, sprinkled with additional nice and wrapped up in nice paper. That's my biggest problem. It's sweet, tender and occasionally humorous but the formulaic and one-dimensional approach prevents the narrative from actually going anywhere. Heck, even that one emotional scene towards the end felt happy. I've seen animations more depressing and heartfelt than this. Don't get me wrong, it's a lovely story about love, friendship and testing your limitations. Delevingne and Wolff are well matched and have good chemistry. I found Quentin's college friends utterly relatable, mostly because I was that guy in school who would actually recite the Pokémon theme tune (don't deny, you know you love it). Surprisingly the cinematography hit me, it was high quality for this genre! Every shot looked the part so was pleasantly surprised. The cryptic breadcrumb trail was interesting and was easily the best part of the film. It's just unfortunate that the third act's road trip loses that well earned intrigue. The characters were bland, the story was formulaic and it all just felt too...nice. Nothing in the screenplay allows the characters to feel! It's all smiles, laughs and one tear (I counted one!!). The relationships seemed forced and, can't believe I'm saying this, Delevingne needed more screen time. She was enigmatic and elusive. In the end, Paper Towns is the kind of film you would watch if you are feeling down. It's nice with good performances but doesn't further itself to be better. Standard formula."
" One for the youth
",0.0,0.9899,2018-02-19 00:00:00,5,"There are some films designed for multiple generations. Which adult hasn't enjoyed 'Toy Story' equally as much as their child (only on different levels!)? However, 'Paper Towns' seems to be one of those 'young adult' tales that can only really be believed if you haven't really lived that long in life (yes, I'm an old cynic). It's the typical 'boy meets girl' story where the two of them grow up together - as friends, obviously - only for her to start partying hard during her late teens, while he studies hard for later life. Naturally, once their circles have moved in different directions, he assumes they'll never get together - until she appears at his bedroom window one night, asking to borrow his car. Now, the boy and girl in question - Quentin and Margo - are both likable enough (and played respectively by Nat Wolff and Cara Delevingne - who, despite what some people say, is actually quite a good young actress who can put on a decent enough American accent), as are their group of friends. So the cast are a fun bunch of people who you will feel drawn to (even if they do offer little new in terms of 'stereotypical American teens'). The problems I can with 'Paper Towns' simply came in the form of its pacing and general believability. The first third of the movie is Nat and Cara, cheering fully tearing up the town in a wild night of throwing caution to the wind and general mayhem. This is fair enough if this is how the whole film was. However, and hopefully I'm not including a spoiler here, Cara then disappears in one of her character's trademark 'mysteries' leaving the rest of the cast wondering where she's gone and how they can find her. And so, for fans of Cara, they may feel a little short-changed by her sudden lack of screen time, as the rest of the movie is taken up with the rest of the cast's road-trip as they try to solve the mystery of where she went to and why.I think I've probably said enough about the plot, so I won't spoil what happens, only to say that - despite the lack of the 'other half' on the love interest part of the story - there are a few things even a hardened cynic such as myself didn't see coming. It seems that whether people love or hate this film depends on how they feel about its ending. Personally, I really enjoyed how they wrapped it up - my only beef was about how the rest of the story was pretty unbelievable. However, what do I know? I'm clearly not this film's demographic - my thirteen year old daughter absolutely loved it, so fair play to the millennials if they appreciate it more than me!"
" Five Stars for Halston Sage; 0 for the rest of the movie
",0.0,0.9911,2018-01-16 00:00:00,5,"You've seen this movie before. It's been called ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" among many other names. It's where the high school loser pines for the most popular girl in school and, through a turn of events and adventure, either wins her heart or otherwise gains her attention and respect. This is pretty much the same.In this case, the high school loser lives across the street from his crush. They don't interact very much; they have different friends. But the girl asks his help in dissing some of her friends through adolescent pranks and vandalism. Then the next day the girl disappears. The high school loser recruits his friends to try to find her.This movie really tanks because the plot isn't believable and because of the cast. The girl playing the crush, Cara Delevigne, isn't very breathtaking or interesting. And the characters, none of whom seem to have jobs, seem to have an endless supply of money. The girl who disappeared just went to another town and spends her days reading books. The methods through which food and lodging are procured is not explained.The one high point is Halston Sage. She's the only reason I watched the movie in the first place. Her character was a popular girl, almost a mean girl, but she joins in the search for the missing princess and befriends one of the high school loser's friends. At the end they went to the prom together. The breathtakingly beautiful popular girl hanging out with a loser/outcast reminded me of a good friend so it was a sentimental moment for me."

" Classic case of book > film
",0.0,0.9667,2017-09-25 00:00:00,7,"I think a rating of 7 is slightly clutching at straws however I did enjoy the film so I want to reflect that. I think that it helps that I've read the book enough times for me to have the complete story in my head, things that didn't seem significant to the story until they were missing... I saw this film with friends who hadn't read the book and they didn't enjoy the film as much as me. For me, reading the book first meant that the film was like adding extra bonus content.. being able to put images in my head although I do think some may watch it and just notice that it wasn't as good in comparison. I think it's worth a watch if this is your genre of film and if you're a reader.. John Green is a fantastic author!"
" An Existential Mystery
",0.0,0.9562,2017-09-16 00:00:00,9,"Released in July 2015 and based on the novel by John Green, Paper Towns (2015) is a coming of age story centered on Quentin ""Q"" Jacobsen and Margo Roth Spiegelman, childhood friends who drift apart while growing up in a nondescript Orlando, Florida subdivision. I enjoyed this film. It weaves urban exploration, road tripping, and geography/cartography around deeper themes involving free will, expectations vs. reality, friendship, and how we confront our own mortality.The title of the film, Paper Towns, comes from a type of fictitious entry that cartographers sometimes use to discourage plagiarism or copyright infringement. This becomes important when Margo Roth Spiegelman refers to Orlando as a ""paper town"" before she mysteriously disappears. Her friends attempt to track her down near a famous fictitious entry, Agloe, New York.To briefly summarize the plot, as a young boy Quentin Jacobsen, played by Nat Wolff, is immediately smitten with Margo Roth Spiegelman, played by Cara Delevingne (a discount Emma Watson), after her family moves into the house across the street. They become inseparable, until one day they discover the body of a man who committed suicide in a park. Margo wants to investigate the man's death, but Quentin chickens out. After that, the two drift apart. Quentin becomes a band geek who always follows the rules, while Margo constantly lives in the moment and falls in with the popular crowd.One night, in their senior year of high school, Margo asks Quentin to help get revenge on her boyfriend and her friends, who betrayed her. After sharing this moment together, Margo mysteriously vanishes. Quentin begins to break out of his shell, and enlists the aid of his friends in a lengthy search for his missing soulmate.Being confronted by death at a young age affects the two main characters very differently. While Quentin emotionally suppresses the incident, it profoundly alters Margo's perception on life. She realizes that every moment is precious, and that she can choose to live outside convention and try to be whatever she wants to be. This, of course, leads to numerous clashes with her parents and her ultimate dissatisfaction with life in Orlando. Her friends' betrayal is the catalyst to finally leave everything behind.Quentin, on the other hand, takes Margo's sudden reappearance in his life as a sign that she wants a more meaningful relationship with him. Following clues she left behind, he throws convention to the wind and pursues her to her hiding place in rural New York. Along the way, his friends also begin to break out of their shells and develop their own relationships. Margo's do-as-she-feels philosophy is the catalyst that inspires this group of shy introverts to take risks and live life to the fullest.While Quentin and friends ultimately must settle back into their previous life goals and routines, there is no such happy ending for Margo. Once shaken out of the herd mentality by her early confrontation with death, she can never settle down and live a ""normal life."" This is a profound point that most moviegoers are likely to overlook because she is introduced as being a member of the ""popular crowd."" How many ""popular girls,"" however, are introspective loners, read literature, study old maps, hang out in abandoned buildings, and run away from home to pursue their artistic interests? The passion to have a richer life experience, a deeper understanding of things, and to escape the average and everyday is one response to human mortality. When confronted with the limits of human existence–the realization that we all have an ""expiration date""–most people will seek comfort in convention, structure, and predictability.Some individuals, however, will disregard convention and take risks in an effort to get the most out of their existence. These individuals will remain perpetual outsiders, a sentiment expressed by Margo when she stares out a window of the SunTrust Center down onto Orlando and describes it as a ""paper town"" filled with fake people, ""not even hard enough to be made of plastic."" At this moment, she reveals how alone she feels despite her apparently carefree, spontaneous life.Inevitably, you end up asking yourself, am I Quentin or Margo? I can safely say I have been both at various times in my life, and the ability to identify with both characters added to the enjoyment of the film. Its refusal to tie up neatly at the end also appealed to me. After all, sometimes the guy doesn't get the girl, and often times our expectations fall far short of reality. But the desire to find meaning in life in the face of death is something we can all identify with. Life and death is, after all, the ultimate mystery."
" Boring

" Average book becomes a below average film
",0.0,0.5637,2017-06-11 00:00:00,2,"After 'Fault in our Stars' did well as a film you can't blame Hollywood I guess for wanting to raid John Green's back catalogue for another book to turn into a film.Problem is the creative team are working on much less solid ground with this material than before.Paper thin plot, paper thin characters, and not great acting to boot make this film fairly forgettable from start to finish.But it's bright, it's got teen stars in, and lots of people will see it because they liked the book.However most will come out saying it isn't any good."
" Funny-mystery movie.
",0.0,-0.5262,2017-05-12 00:00:00,7,"In this story Quentin had a crush on his neighbor Margo since childhood. One day when they were little, they saw a dead man lying under a tree. Margo was interested to investigate about the dead man. So she asked Quentin to help her but Quentin refused. So after many years her friends betrayed her so she wanted to revenge them. I think the movie should be more interesting but the movie was funny. It's okay for one time watch."
" Margo apparently didn't have Huntington's
",0.0,-0.9865,2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"I didn't really want to write a review - I wanted to write a comment on the discussion boards, but they're gone, so here we are.I watched this on Canadian Netflix because the availability of non-B movies on that site is not great. I hadn't read the book, because I know it's one of those coming-of-age stories I hate. When I saw the scene in which one of the guys looks up the bio of that folk singer on his phone, I was sure I knew where the movie was going - the article on the folk singer had said he'd died of Huntington's, which I knew was a genetic condition that often appears in the person's 30s and inevitably results in a slow and terrible death. So I thought, oh, that's why Margo is so reckless and apt to give advice about how other people should be living their lives, she knows she has this condition and is going to have a short time to live. So the whole time, I was expecting Q to search and search for her only to find that she'd lived it up madly and then killed herself to prevent slow deterioration, or that Q would never find her but would learn years later that at the onset of symptoms she'd jumped off a mountainside or something. She seemed like the type of person who would do that. And then Q, instead of becoming an oncologist, would become a researcher in neurological diseases and this would be the legacy she left him.Instead, she turned out to be an ordinary brat who ran away in order to ""find"" herself, not having graduated high school. Boring. Which leads me to my second point of irritation with this movie, which is that, either the author has completely forgotten what it was like to be 17, or he was also a spoiled brat. These teens all have cars, no jobs, unlimited cash, and their parents are perfectly fine with them ditching school without notice and driving across the country. They all have way more independence and disposable income than seems likely. Margo is living by herself in some hick town. What happens after the money runs out and all her former friends have finished high school, and she doesn't have a degree and can't get a job? I hate the rosy picture of the three friends heading their separate ways to new adventures at the end of the movie. What would the average life course of real people be? Yes, some would become oncologists and spend 80 hours a week working and rarely get to see their fancy houses, some would become journalists for CNN and travel the world, but most will be ordinary and get married, get an uninteresting job to pay the bills, and spend their weekends trying to get their squealing infants to stop crying long enough to pick up diapers at Walmart. And then get divorced. I'm just being realistic here.The movie has a typical upper-middle-class American ""follow your muse, discover your true self"" underlying message that is very unoriginal and very uninspiring."
