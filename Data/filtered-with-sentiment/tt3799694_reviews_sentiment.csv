" Just good enough for an evening when your brain is overheated
",0.4404,0.9513,2021-03-28 00:00:00,7,"It's nice, funny and a good story but that's it. No glamorous acting or brilliant script. Just tune your brain to zero and enjoy. Do not try overthinking because there's nothing at all to think about this movie."
" Very likeable and popcorn-y, but also makes you think
",0.2838,0.9899,2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"This movie is just good. It has a nice story, it has nice characters and perfect acting, it is funny and engaging, it is interesting from start to finish. The era is made to look awesome and vivid, and watching such good actors like Gosling and Crowe (who absolutely nail the roles although no one would ever imagine these two being buddies) interact is a pure pleasure. I really liked the idea of the corruption and how it is presented through a comic relief- definitely deserves more attention that it gets."
" Wit done right
",0.0,0.9659,2021-03-17 00:00:00,8,"The nice guys is an underrated gem and I fully recommend and in the future I hope Gosling does more films like this, I really liked the chemistry between Gosling and Rowe (I think that's his name), the only thing I didnt like was the character holly she was very annoying, then again I dont know if they intended that or not. Other than that great film easily goes in my top 20."
" Not worth it

" A fun tribute to '70s mystery movies.
",0.5106,0.9989,2021-03-05 00:00:00,7,"Shane Black has made movies like Iron Man 3 and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (a movie I haven't seen yet). Now, he's going for the '70s mystery genre. KKBB is kinda mystery too (I suppose), but this time he's doing classic '70s style. I love it. The Nice Guys made me laugh many times, and the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling is just so beautiful and funny.I love this movie very much. I laughed many times, but not as many times as other movies I like to watch. If I should compare this movie to another movie, it would be KKBB, but I haven't seen it yet, so I'm instead going for 21 Jump Street. The plot isn't near the same as here, but the humour kinda is. The Nice Guys is the '70s 21 Jump Street. And also, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling is almost as funny as Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.I like much of this movie, and I laughed when I should laugh. Laughter is the first ingredient in a comedy. Normally, I would talk about the cast, but every supporting character is being overshadowed by Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. A quick shout-out to Angourie Rice too. She is almost perfect in this movie as Ryan Gosling's clever, but a little bit irritating daughter. Another funny actor is Matt Bomer as the assassin who's gonna kill Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. He's near perfect too.Be aware of the movie's R-rating. I mean, I guess you know it, but just like Sausage Party, that's NOT a movie for kids. Not this one, either. I almost did watch this one with my parents. I suggest you read the plot before you do anything like that.Anyway, this is a movie that's definitely worth watching. It's a very good and funny movie, but it don't reach the top list of my best movies."
" What a ridiculous movie
",-0.3612,-0.8407,2021-03-04 00:00:00,4,"It isn't worth a serious critique becouse nothing in this movie is worth it. Gosling's character is too annoying to be beared. Crowe's character is non existent. It all revolves around the flat (albeit important) environmental message. It is not a comedy, it is not a drama, it is nothing at all. The involvment of the young daughter is ludicrous: the kids will save the world or some senseless message like that. An A cast wasted. I had a hard time reaching the end of the movie, since it found it's plot, it's script, it's direction and it's acting quite insulting for the average brain. I do not add spoilers because the movie is spoiled enough."
" Pretty dang enjoyable
",0.7269,0.4334,2021-03-02 00:00:00,7,"This film was made really well with it having a interesting plot, with easy to follow and well developed characters. The scenery changes all the time, there is really funny bits, real serious bits and a mix and mash of weird moments and action scenes which makes this a very fun and easy to watch film. Ryan gosling did great with his role being a super funny clumsy usual character that is sweet at heart. His partner played by russel crowe I honestly didn't like at all. Russells character is a ass to begin with and the directors try to make him redeemable but at the end he is still a murderer, he lies and is a arrogant piece of work. Didn't like him throughout the whole movie which is the only bummer. Overall a pretty decent film that has a bit of everything to keep your interest. 7.5/10 for me, I'd highly reccomend it."
" Funny-action R rated movie

" Gosh I miss the old times
",-0.1531,0.9737,2021-02-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie is just a nice throw back to old school movies. Physical comedy, alcohol, drugs, sex, violence all mixing together just fine, and people not taking themselves too seriously like nowadays.I don't want to sound like an old git nostalgic about olden times but they were better. This movie gives me hope though. A great funny storyline and excellent acting by the main three characters.I just wanted to add that the reviewer ddam0767 is an fing moron. Check out their review: ""I think IMDb should have an age profile to show which age groups like or dislike a movie."" They do you idiot.Very Recommended."
" Haters gonna hate....
",-0.4939,0.995,2021-02-09 00:00:00,9,"This buddy cop comedy is one of the most fun rides I've been on in years. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe absolutely shine in this clever throwback spoof of the 70's PI flick! It's like the Rockford files meets three fugitives. Angourie Rice steals the show. Shane Black has come along way from the Monster Squad, but has never lost his love for combining suspense and comedy. As for the ""Munich""'s that are trashing this film in the comments here... they wish they could create something this clever or fun! Alas they couldn't, they lack the disposition to understand this film and it's many components. These are probably the people who think Aunt Donna's house of fun is ""clever romp""... nerds using their best buds bum as a drum... so please enjoy this actual clever romp, it's a blast!!!"
" Textbook example of hollywoodian style over substance
",0.0,0.9663,2021-02-07 00:00:00,5,"This movie is a decent watch if you just wanna go with the flow, want to see two of your A-listers play whacky, misfitting characters. They do it A-OK. There are some problems with the movie though.Gosling and Crowe make the most of this script, but the script itself is quite mediocre. It really feels like it was written trying to have all of thee theme ideas like ""porn"", ""big 70s party"" ""driving around in bigass cars"" ""funky suits"" ""hippies and conspiracies"", ""mobsters and hitmen"" ""buddy cop"" etc. and it very much shows.The camerawork is nice, really brings out the stylish color palette of the sets. The style is greatly presented, but the substance and the plot feel somehow shallow, it is very full of deus ex machinas, the characters really do not feel like real people to me (and it is not the fault of the actors), maybe except the Gosling daughter."
" Moves at real pace - is slick - maybe too slick for it's boots. But that's spoof 4 U
",0.0,0.9796,2021-02-03 00:00:00,7,"It was good. Moved at real pace. Plenty of slick Cinematography,Edits,Jokes,Tricks and Homage. At times there is the issue of ""comedy"" ultra-violence. The jokes and prat-falls are there, so Scene X, Y or Z must be funny - surely? But sometimes it doesn't lock those concepts together so well and I am not a sensitive snowflake. This is entertainment and takes its clue from Bond, Red or even Tarantino. At times though, it really was just too smart about itself - and was a whisker away from being embarrassingly self-aware and trite. The saviour is that Gosling & Crowe are confirmed visual magnets, so it would be tough to create a mutt out of that pairing. As someone else said, the young girl as Gosling's daughter is a superb talent for such a young actor. I'd like to see Gosling and Crowe in a different, serious, pairing - but that's unlikely now. It's worth a viewing and it will be over before you realise."

" We don't get many detective stories like this. A nice, funny and well written movie.
",0.8674,0.996,2021-01-28 00:00:00,6,"""The Nice Guys"" is a well written movie. Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe really did an amazing characterization, two detectives with two completely different approaches that match perfectly. The movie is set during the 70s and the director just nailed the mood: music, editing and color grading are just on point, not to talk about locations, clothes and cars. It is a really simple movie, nothing groundbreaking. I mean, the plot twist is nothing surprising, but its simple script just work and this production manages to entertain for two hours. There is a nice balance between research/investigation scenes, and action-packed sequences, that are very smooth, maybe sometimes a little bit exaggerated, but this was made to match the comedic vibe. In fact I laughed a lot through the film, I think that there are many hilarious and well conceived moments, comedic times are nicely done.Overall, it is a nice production. I really enjoyed the Jack and Holland duo, and I think that Holly is an added value, she really contributes to develop the plot, and her acting skills are surprisingly good. If you are looking for a fun night, this might be a really nice watch."
" Great duo
",0.6249,0.8271,2021-01-28 00:00:00,8,"Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe make up a good onscreen duo, funny at times and dramatic at others, while being sustained by good directing instructions and cinematography"
" Darkly comic homage to Bud Spencer, Terence Hill, and the 70s!
",0.0,0.4882,2021-01-26 00:00:00,9,"Shane Black has built a reputation for wayward humor and he certainly lives up to that label in THE NICE GUYS. He is greatly aided by spectacular photography, awesome stunts and a roller coaster of a script often on the far side of believability and forever exploiting the dark humor of any situation.Best of all, the acting: the leads and Angourie Rice are longer on screen than others but I remember short support roles by Keth David (his death scene is memorable), Matt Bomer as the cold-blooded assassin who brilliantly dispatches Amelia, Yaya da Costa as another budding murderess... but it is Rice as the pure soul in the midst of so much depravity, pornography, murder, and all manner of crime, that stands out.Crowe is brilliant in an understated role as a killing machine brought under control by Rice, who threatens not to talk to him again if he kills a murderer. And the bumbling worst detective ever, Gosling, who keeps falling and, as he does so, he keeps hitting upon solutions.The sequence where Crowe and Gosling go up in a lift and see several people killed, close the lift's door and just leave is in the best tradition of dark comedy. The one where Gosling thinks he sees Nixon in the pool is also fantastic. The fight between Crowe and David had me laugh throughout. The porno movie intro at a car demo show is memorable, as is the shootout that follows.Crowe is Bud Spencer to Terence Hill's Gosling, but both are far darker and more selfish characters than that very funny duo of the 1970s - especially the Trinity spaghetti Westerns.No moral values in this film - except the little girl who embodies hope for the future because she cares so much for doing the right thing. She is the highest spire in this unholy trinity.Self-deprecating, great fun flick. 9/10"
" It's ok
",0.296,0.6093,2021-01-22 00:00:00,5,"I'm surprised this has a 7.4 average. I thought it would be better. There are some funny parts and the actors, of course, are great, but it's not hilarious and was dragging for me because it wasn't hilarious. It's was kind of funny and that's about it."
" Terrible movie
",-0.4767,-0.9223,2021-01-21 00:00:00,1,"The film is so un-funny, I had to stop watching. It can not decide what style to follow. We have the buddy cops, we have the wisecracking young blond daughter (homage to all of Eastwood's early films?/ homage to Taxi Driver?/ Paper Moon?); worst of all we have Ryan trying some type of double take shtick at one point.
The plot is a total mess. Characters are undeveloped.
I do not understand why this movie needed to be set in 70's. It was a very shallow depiction of 70's. No one would be playing Pong at home on a screen. The sharp young black executive female aide in a killer suit did not exist in 70's. I think maybe the 70's were used as an excuse to weave low, cheap humor of graphic sex in there involving minors. And to pass it off as ""well that's how it was in the 70's""."
" Redefines the buddy cop genre, a great comedy that is actually a great movie!
",0.8999,0.9992,2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,"Plot:In 1970s Los Angeles, a mismatched pair of private eyes investigate a missing girl and the mysterious death of a porn star.Analysis:Buddy cop movies have been a huge era of mainstream cinema in the 70s and the 80s, they defined these decades and got an enormous amount of fans. Shane Black took the risk of creating a controversional and original buddy cop, mystery movie, a humoristic take on the genre that gave the audience something new and entertaining, the perfect combination for a fun experience.From the very first moments this one works perfectly, it has a pair of great actors who try their best, there is a nice 20th century aesthetic and the plot is both silly and interesting maintaining a nice balance between keeping the viewers invested and entertained. Ryan Gosling shines is this movie, he is a very gifted actor, he can be amazing in every role and he proves once more that he can be a great comedian too. He is casual and embraces the silliness of this movie without trying, it feels very natural for him and he is the main reason this movie was a huge success. Russel Crowe is also very good, he is an actor that can go from Gladiator's badass Maximus to A Beautiful Mind's Nash very fast, so this role was just another one of the great performances you can spot in his resume, he was once more the best choice for the role and he didn't disappoint his fans.Nice Guys has also a very clever screenplay. Despite the hillarious yet interesting mystery the two detectives try to solve, it's a film that doesn't rely only on humor, but it delevlops its characters, it gives well executed ideas and it has some very intetesting bonding going on. Healy is a man that does what he does for living, no noble causes, no moral dilemas, he takes the money and gets the job done, an attitude with deep roots in his personallity, in his inner fears. Through his realationships with Holland and his daughter Holly he finds out that change is possible and sometimes the best choice, he finds partership, purpose and a chance for change. Holland is also a nice example of a well written character, his silly attitude, his jokes, his weird personality are all a way of denying reality and through this adventure he will learn a valuable lesson.It's a very ambitious movie, it could be just another buddy cop casual funny film but the creator wanted a better and improved version of the genre. It's well-written, it's aesthetically fabulous and it does almost everything right when it didn't have to and that is actually something very respectable. Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi had a fresh vision on this mystery and it was actually an amazing execution of a brilliant idea.Conclusion:It's a movie for everyone who wants something funny but not stupidly simplistic, it's a movie that offers way more than you can imagine it will surely be on your favourite comedies without a doubt. Clever humor but still quite chessy, beautiful colours, amazing cast and an opportunity for you to experience something unique and new.Rating: 9/10"
" Plot Armor and Incompetence Personified... Hilariously.

If you like both of them then this will be one of your new favorite buddy movies.The daughter, Holly, is the smartest and most capable character throughout the film, serving as the backbone for her lovable oaf father, Holland, and the gruff heavy, Heely. Together they form an improbably effective detective squad and find themselves embroiled in a reasonably interesting conspiracy."

It follows an unlikely pair of private eyes investigating a missing girl and the mysterious death of a porn star. This film is obviously Shane Black's love letter to 1970's Hollywood. From the cinematography, the music, and the production design, everything feels like it's accurately depicting its setting. The chemistry between the actors on screen can't go unnoticed as Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe were perfect here with their impeccable comedic timing and delivery. Angourie Rice - as the daughter of Gosling's character - is amazing. She manages to keep up with Crowe and Gosling in the film, being just as funny. On top of that, the writing is very clever and raw which is what's needed for this type of movie. The Nice Guys is a great film and it is often overlooked, even though it had an established director like Shane Black and renowned actors like Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Regardless the film barely made its budget back at the worldwide box office."
" More Stylish Than Substantial

In 1970s Los Angeles, Two Private Detectives And Unlikely Partners Must Team Up To Find A Missing Girl Who Is Sought After By Some Dangerous Criminals. I Remember Liking The Film A Lot More When I First Saw It Four Years Ago, But Upon A Second Watch, I Came To Realize That The Film Is More Stylish Than It Is Substantial. The 1970s-esque Style And Neo-Noirish Vibe Are The Most Appealing Things About The Film. That Isn't To Say It's A Bad Movie. It's To Say That The Plot Feels A Bit Exaggerated. It Seems That Many Of The Scenarios Only Happen Because It Was Written Into The Script. While The Acting Was Average, There Were Some Genuinely Funny Moments Between Crowe And Gosling. It Just Feels Like Everyone Could Have Given More. Most Of The A-Listers In This Film Gave Flatter Than Normal Performances. But What Saves The Film Are The Comedic Beats, The Action Set Pieces, Smooth Direction, And The Groovy Soundtrack. And I'm A Sucker For All Of Those Things. 76%."

" The message seems forced and doesn't fit
",-0.6261,0.8705,2020-12-06 00:00:00,6,"The movie had good moments and I liked how it blended comedy into the noir-like story. However, once the last act came to a close it go very preachy and had a lackluster ending.I guess the way the movie ends is supposed to have the audience questioning their actions as well as the actions of United States capitalism, but that message came very out of place. This movie was a fun buddy cop with serious notes to the story for almost the entire way through. But then the movie hamfisted in a deeper meaning in my opinion that felt out of place.I'm all about climate change action, but it just seemed out of place for everything that proceeded the last act."
" The Daughter Ruins It...
",-0.4404,-0.7656,2020-12-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie has a few big problems that bring it down in my opinion.My biggest problem was unnecessarily making the little girl a main character in this somewhat gritty rated r film as if this is a family Disney movie, she was just so misplaced. The time spent on her could've been used to develop the lead characters relationship more.The second biggest problem was the lazy and flat comedy, they definitely needed better writers. The comedy often didn't fit in this movie at all which gives the film an overall confusing tone. Also, Ryan Gosling doesn't do bad but this type of role is way more up Ryan Reynolds alley and casting him instead would've likely enhanced the movie.The third and final problem that stopped this movie from being what it could've been is the confusing plot. I wasn't quite sure how certain things came together or what anyone's motivation was in many parts of the movie.Overall, this movie wasn't terrible but it's nothing special at all. My guess is that Warner bros. is to blame for most of these issues."

The ending could've been better. It felt mediocre compared to how great the rest of the movie was. I'll watch this one again, it's worth the second viewing. Gosling knocked it out of the park. Again, I think it's really too bad this didn't do better. It might've encouraged him to do more roles like this because he was really good at it. I hope he does something similar again anyway.

The chemistry between them was very well done. I typically have issues with kids in films being annoying (war of the worlds springs to mind there), but I adored the kid ""Holly"" in this.
The small elements of humour added in I thought was a great touch and really did tickle me.
It's also a nice ending, no funny business by the director.My only negative thoughts about this film is that we didn't really get a good background on either Gosling's or Crowe's characters, kind of just jumped straight into it.
I also think the plot could have been slightly hard to follow in the first hour of the film. Due to the jumping into things approach.But overall it's a really good film and I enjoyed watching it. 8/10 from me, really worth giving it a go if you are considering watching it."

So originally I was quite looking forward to ""The Nice Guys"" as from the trailer the film seem to convey a sense of style and pervado that I found quite intriguing, so my anticipation for this film was quite high, and well ""The Nice Guys"" does live up to my expectations it does not pass them by any means. First off this film is excellently written, with a great mystery that keeps the audience hooked throughout and many comedic scenes that had me splitting with laughter. Gosling and Crowe's chemistry was unexpectedly and uniquely perfect in this film, I'd totally love to see them in another movie again or possibly a Nice Guys 2. Now there is a young girl in this film who I found to falter a bit, there were times she would be really good and to others where it felt like she was reading off a script. I have no problems with this movie whatsoever, the action was great, comedy was funny and all around it was great flick. I wish had more to say about but ""The Nice Guys"" was just a solid flick and I got everything I wanted out of it. ""The Nice Guys"" gets a 8/10."

When I watched it, I was floored at how good it was - but how it maintained this quality from start to finish. However, I suspect the reason it might not have been as successful is because truly amazing stuff rarely is. It's one of the best comedy films I've seen, one of the best murder-mystery-crime films, and the best comedy-murder-mystery-crime film I've seen.The setting is flawless, and the attention to detail to capture the time period was mesmerizing. The movie blends its 70's setting with its cartoon-like action and delivery.The tone is perfect; mixing murder mystery with true comedy.The comedy writing is the best and most well timed I've seen outside of extremely rare, masterful writing seen once in a blue moon; thinks the first ten seasons of the Simpsons quality. The movie doesn't go thirty seconds without delivering a zinger.Not once does the script hit a plateau or a flat area, except for maybe one or two lines which seem like poor taste; but even then Crowe and Gosling make them work. The movie and script are empathetic yet at the same time tongue-in-cheek towards society at that time.Gosling is a natural comedian and a sublimely talented actor with boundless range. Note the scene in which he stumbles upon a body; delivering his drunken terror is the finest acting I've seen in recent years. Crowe is Crowe, a legend of the craft.The action and violence is realistic and gritty, and fits well with the high comedy, never conflicting with one another.Off casting is great, with all other actors being perfect.This movie is exactly what happens when a director or a cast are passionate about a project, and it shows. All involved were clearly passionate about film in general and the love and care they spent on the movie shine through.It's a 9.5.5 points off for some questionable bullet physics and the story not being as complex as anticipated but this is so negligible it doesn't matter."
" A contrived, and flawed, yet hilarious joy ride with 2 perfect leads.
",0.8807,0.978,2020-10-18 00:00:00,6,"(Minor Spoilers) With Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe fantastically cast as the leads with perfect chemistry, they bring absolute genius hilarity for real fun time. This movie has great style, wit, and is overall competently made thanks to Shane Black's strong direction, but unfortunately is still heavily flawed. The entire story is extremely contrived with a nearly immortal protagonist, which is even joked about in the movie. There are far too many convenient moments like when the person they're looking for literally falls on their car, or the countless times they get away from impossible situations because of pure luck. The daughter character, while very well acted by Angourie Rice, is forced into the movie, somehow leaving the film like nothing happened after multiple traumatic events. The movie begins subverting our expectations by showing us a more realistic and messy portrayal of the violence depicted. Yet the movie still remains quite cliched and unrealistic at times, with all the tropes you'd expect from these types of films. There's big shoot outs where the characters are never hit, but there's also hilarious mess ups from the characters you'd never expect in a movie. The film does a great job of setting up these characters real quick in the beginning, and making us feel for them. Especially March, as he reacts to these absurd moments and subversions the same way we would. It's an odd combination of definite moments of unpredictability, but also remaining weirdly conventional at times as well. It just causes the movie feel messy, like it doesn't know what it's trying to be, but it's hard to fault a movie that is this funny. There's even some odd moments which seem supernatural, which are both done well and badly. A dream sequence that sets up for one of the cleverest and funniest jokes in the film, but also the moment where he falls into the pool (which is extremely convenient that not only was there a pool there, but a bad guy fell and died next to it, while he landed perfectly safe in the pool) and sees Nixon... This movie definitely has its problems, but I was consistently laughing, even out loud almost in tears (which is very rare for me), so it makes it very hard to rate this film. If the humor works for you then this will absolutely be a great time, but if it doesn't, the entire movie will collapse in on itself.(6/10)"

-The thread of humanity and vulnerability underneath the crime and action is largely absent...
-...making what little character development there is lack real meaning and emotional payoff.If you're a Kiss Kiss Bang Bang fan who wants another hit out of the park from Shane Black in a similar vein, this isn't it.

The chemistry between Gosling and Crowe is truly out of this world, and it's truly dumbfounding how good they are together in these roles, especially when I heard they didn't exactly get along on set. Shane Black has not only provided an incredibly fun buddy cop-like action comedy to enjoy, but also a strangely accurate satirical view of the underbelly of society, and I loved every minute of it. Obviously Gosling and Crowe were great in their roles, but Angourie Rice deserves as much credit as she can get for her role as Holly, as she is somehow able to keep up with the two stars in a surprisingly incredible fashion. The film is entertaining, beautiful to look at, and full of catchy 70's tunes that you are bound to recognize. Its humor can be a bit dark at times, but I personally loved it, as nearly every joke made me belly laughing, if not laughing harder. In the end, The Nice Guys is an underrated little gem that I would be absolutely delighted to see a sequel for. It has so much going for it due to the great talent involved, but what makes the film so grand, is how truly fun it is, and the smile it leaves on your face all the way up to the credits.

There was NO plot, NO humor, just an excuse to keep showing bare breasted women & constant death (and not even in a creative John Woo sort of way or amsuingly like Naked Gun). Throw in some just child endangerment. And the usual ""trained assassin with semi-automatic gun can't even hit obvious easy targets.
You could see everything coming & the end of the movie telegraphed in advance.Least important nitpick: Telling someone to dial 911 in 1977, it started in 1984 in LA.

There's nothing in this recipe that should work, yet somehow Shane Black has blended up a black comedy that feels simultaneously from a bygone movie era and completely refreshing.

It's actually quite funny and inventively plotted, though the comedy is fairly broad-brush and it quickly transitions from low-key to wild, concluding in a lengthy fight scence which although played for laughs could have been taken from a superhero movie in terms of its violence and preposterous complexity.

The stuff and nonsense between Crowe and Gosling grows old after a while but for some time it'll keep you entertained. So will Angourie Rice who plays Gosling's precocious, brilliant, and brave young daughter. Until you realize that the relationship between her and her father is a bizarre one; she is the common sense mother to her immature father. That is until she places her life in danger and once she does that you start asking 'Does anyone here have a brain?' And when the answer comes back, 'Nope', you stop caring.The plot is impossible to follow. I've seen it twice and I'm convinced that a third viewing will not help. Mistaken identity, bad cops, good cops, porn stars, Hollywood stars, and - get this - a 'clean air message' just serve to propel the buddy business into the film's second hour. Finally the film seems to end three separate times, only to begin again with a new reason for being. I'm not convinced that anything but the buddy-business actually mattered."

A buddy cop film in this generation could've easily gone wrong but Black made it work. The 70s atmosphere feels very nostalgic and memories of films like Lethal Weapon start flooding in. The script by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi is extremely witty and funny. The jokes aren't cheap and the overall amount of them keeps you engaged till the end. The plot is very absurd but it feels right for a film that doesn't take itself that seriously. Aside from Black's script and direction, there are two more reasons to see this film.Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are superb onscreen together. They have a great amount of chemistry and make each scene all the more funny. I'm used to seeing Gosling do serious roles but this film shows his capability as a comedic actor. His comic timing is brilliant and without a doubt the highlight of the film. Russell Crowe's character is far more serious which plays a great contrast to Gosling. The action scenes involving him are enjoyable to watch. Another star is Angourie Rice who's really entertaining as Gosling's daughter. The only person I'm conflicted about is Margaret Qualley. I think she could have been better.The Nice Guys is a fun way to spend two hours of your life. The film's jokes and gags are absolutely hilarious and the cast make it even better. It's great to see a revival of the buddy cop genre. I hope Shane Black makes a sequel because this looks like a promising series."

She was probably only on set for a day and probably hadn't even seen the script before shooting

There are several blues and patterns, but they don't spoil the overall impression.The characters are bright and easy to remember. The cast is very good. And it applies to everyone from John the killer to the daughter of Healy.A few words about the main characters. Gosling and Crowe played very cool. Ryan perfectly portrayed his image as an alcoholic detective who, after the drama in his life, does not believe in himself.Very glad to see Russell in the movie.

Maybe the most staggering case of a great first half and below mediocre second one that I've seen. The wrap up is laughable and doesn't live up to the great start. Crowe and Gosling are great.

The dialogue back and forth between the two is seamless as is the blend of flaw and quirkiness in each of their characters. Very well done by those two and by Black, who brought out their best in each scene.
The rest of the cast is very well chosen and given some great lines to work with. All of the characters you meet along the way only add to the weave (not a fan of Kim Basinger in it, though), especially Angourie Rice, who truly adds that perfect touch to the whole thing. I know some folks find the situations that this youngish girl is exposed to way too risquÃ©, and I understand. However, she acts more mature than her age throughout and pulls it off without it being creepy...in fact the level of aplomb and thoughtfulness displayed by the character and actress takes the edge right out of it.
The late '70s are perfectly captured throughout in scene, attitude and soundtrack. In so many ways it gave you that feeling of being back there again in just about every scene. I saw my first car..an almost exact copy. The music matched perfectly with the flow all the way through and may rival the soundtracks from Boogie Nights and Guardians of the Galaxy.
Last but not least, the way that Shane Black moved seamlessly from scene to scene without a real pause, yet always building to a satisfying climax just fit so well with the rest of the elements that it makes the whole movie just..enjoyable. Great stuff..too bad it didn't do well enough to warrant a second one."
" An Excellent Celebrity Pairing in a Slightly Above-Average Comedy
",0.7115,-0.3272,2020-02-10 00:00:00,7,"A buddy cop throwback in more ways than one, The Nice Guys follows a pair of mismatched private eyes in pursuit of a grand conspiracy that connects everything from porno to the auto industry. It revels in the late-70s setting, poking fun at the fashion, dÃ©cor, celebrity and personal habits of the era, but at heart it feels a touch more modern.I was struck, repeatedly, at the tonal similarities to the Lethal Weapon franchise, so it was with no great shock that I discovered Nice Guys' director, Shane Black, made his first bucks as a screenwriter for those Mel Gibson action/comedies. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are the new Gibson and Glover, an odd couple whose pursuit of the truth (and the accompanying payoff, naturally) only barely supersedes their grumbling dislike for one another. Crowe is the anchor, your typical gruff exterior with a warm, chewy center, but Gosling steals the show as his loopy, desperate, unpredictable counterpart. They both get some strong one-liners (and one spectacular silent team-up gag in an elevator), but for my money, Gosling does more with his.The plot never fully recovers from a risky swerve at the end of the second act, and it plays the pesky kid tagalong card way too often, but it's not trying to be fine art and such missteps sometimes go with the territory. It is what it sets out to be, for better or worse. I enjoyed myself."
" Ryan Gosling as a ragdoll

Ryan Gosling is a perfect casting for this rule, I love this guy. And Russell Crowe is an absolute badass in this. These two have great chemistry together even though as characters they're different. Shane Black is a genius and his style of directing this film is so damn cool and entertaining. If hopefully there will ever be a sequel I will be the first in line.

A short time later, I was questioning how on earth Ryan Gosling's character got custody of his 13 year old daughter; she doesn't appear to go to school, and pretty much just runs around by herself with absolutely no supervision of any kind. Not long after that, after a porn party, which Gosling allowed his daughter to attend, again unsupervised, while he got drunk and did nothing remotely intelligent, I turned it off wondering why anyone would waste their time watching it. None of it actually made any sense whatsoever. Really pathetic."

The two leads, Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe along with Angourie Rice, Gosling's bold daughter all wonderfully show out in a 'crimedy' tale full of twist and turns.Firstly, the jokes in this film, while not ""Dave Chappelle"" hilarious, have a strong effect and work really well with the characters who deliver them. It stems from the fact that none of the characters are every 'trying' to be funny in the first place which makes the scenes all the more hilarious. Unfortunately for me, viewing the trailer for this film tad ruined the surprise element as it contains some of the funniest lines of the film in the trailer.In terms of originality, this film doesn't disappoint. Shane Black took a relatively cliched time period associated with hippies, rebellious adolescents, drugs and flashy parties and fashion and managed to use all those elements to the film's advantage.I definitely recommend seeing this film, even if you have seen the trailers, don't hold yourself back. Its probably one of the funniest films I've ever seen."

The jokes were low-tier flat and weak, somehow the incoherent pace between scenes and the bad timing of most jokes made them feel shoved by force.Lots of users will disagree with this, I understand, you loved this movie because you got brainwashed that this movie is good, hence the good rating.

" A film filled with witty banter, adequate action, and an incredible 1970's soundtrack.
",0.2263,0.9884,2019-03-08 00:00:00,7,"I'll be honest that the trailer for this film is the main reason I went to go see it. The few bits revealed in it definitely painted a picture of a smart and funny film. The pairing of Ryan Gosling with Russell Crowe was an interesting one, but definitely works on the ""buddy cop"" adventure level. While Gosling had almost every funny line, the action brought to the film via Crowe's slightly heavier form really helped to balance things out. The full film definitely delivered on what the trailer had to offer.With dialogue that comes fast and full of quips, I was laughing throughout most of this film. It almost has a ""self-aware"" feel to it, as each failed piece of the investigation would have normally led to the next logical step. As it is rated R, it unfortunately has an incredible amount of questionable material, including plenty of nudity (as the main plot revolves around pornography), incessant cursing, and regular violence. Much of this isn't too distracting, but the heavy-handed social message about pollution and corporate corruption is a bit obnoxious in a film that I was expecting to be fun.In the end, the Gosling/Crowe dynamic works and helps to propel the film forward between balanced segments of comedy and action. If you focus on what's being said, there's plenty to laugh about, but also a number of good examples of character development. I wouldn't mind seeing this pair of ""nice guys"" again in a sequel.A film filled with witty banter, adequate action, and an incredible 1970's soundtrack, I give The Nice Guys 3.5 stars out of 5."

But while these sorts of problematic moments crop up from time to time in this buddy-detective movie, it manages enough entertaining moments to keep it interesting.The story, involving a sleazy detective and a a thug who join forces to find a missing girl, is fairly engaging, especially in the first half, even though the seams begin to show in the second. Gosling and Crowe are both amusing characters even if they're chemistry is only so-so. The movie is often funny although the humor can sometimes be juvenile and cheap. The 70s period seems random, but occasionally is used for a good joke. The action is decent.It's not by any means a great movie, and it hits a number of sour notes (including the odd speechifying of a bad guy at the end), but overall I did enjoy it."
" Waltons, Poronography, Tricky Dicky, Hitler, Equanimity, Bumble Bees ... And Stuff!
",-0.2244,0.9974,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"The Nice Guys is directed by Shane Black and Black co-writes the screenplay with Anthony Bagarozzi. It stars Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling and Angourie Rice. Music is by John Ottman and David Buckley and cinematography by Philippe Rousselot.1977 Los Angeles and a private detective and a muscle for hire enforcer wind up on the same case looking for a missing girl. Can opposites really attract? More importantly, can they survive not just the perils of a case that gets murkier the longer it goes on? But also each other?I don't care if Colonel Mustard did it in the study with a candlestick. I just wanna know who he did it with and get the pictures.How wonderful to have had Shane Black back in his comfort zone and producing such a joyful buddy buddy neo-noir of considerable substance. It was eleven years since the superb Kiss Kiss Bang Bang had reminded us that Black had few peers when it came to blending high action macho twosomes who are also armed with sharp tongues to match, this was after all the guy who also penned Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. The idea for The Nice Guys had sat in gestation for a number of years, finally it was unleashed to reward fans of his work and for those in sync with the style of film making he homages.Much like his other buddy scriptings, we are in the company of two mismatched guys. Gosling's ex-cop Holland March is a bit goofy, afraid of the sight of blood and morally bankrupt. Crowe's muscle for hire Jackson Healy beats people up for money, but he's a stand-up guy, likes his pet fish, even has a hero streak. What binds them together is troubled family baggage, that they are both men in search of a better world, to be better men themselves, and thus Black - to give them a chance of life improvement - pitches them into the seamy underbelly of the L.A. pornography industry - with some corruption elsewhere thrown into the equation.As a coupling March and Healy prove to be a riot. Crowe is menacing and funny with it, Gosling is affably flaky but charm personified, and thankfully both men have a knack for visual comedy (see Gosling's Lou Costello homage and Crowe's reaction to a henchman's act of fish murder). Crucially both actors can deliver killer lines, which is an absolute must for a Shane Black inspired production, for here there is never any let up, zingers are unbound. Then there is Rice (superb and actually the third lead in the play) as March's 13 year old daughter, she's got youthful zest and a killer matter of fact skill in reacting smartly to the two men currently dominating her life.The L.A. of the 70s is expertly designed, all blink blink blinkity blink neon lighting, side-burns and disco music, dubious fashions and protest groups protesting about the most mundane of things. Then you got the pornography angle, the 70s a hot-bed (no pun intended) for the sex sells profiteers, the perfect setting for Black to trawl through it all in noir clobber. As a noir piece it has it all, femme fatales, thugs, conspiracies, voice overs and an array of colourfully odd characters (excitable and troubling henchmen, a porno Pinocchio, a young lad willing to flash the contents of his underpants for cash!). And of course there's mysteries to be solved and rocks to be upturned, all of which is played out in a whirl of stylish violence, situational comedy and fluid camera work.Black kind of wants it all, to stay cool whilst having wry observations on the Americana of the era, and he enjoys going close to the knuckle when he can, which to some (not me) will come off as a shock value humour tactic just to ruffle feathers. It's also a minor itch that he sort of snatches from his previous works in search of reassurance - note for instance the similarities between the opening to Lethal Weapon and here with The Nice Guys. But itches be damned, so much fun and hidden dramatic depth on show here, a real treasure that makes you wish Black would stroll down neo-noir lane a bit more often. Don't believe me? Then may Richard Nixon come after you the next time you go for a swim in the pool! 9/10"

Holland Marsh (Ryan Gosling) crosses paths with a bruiser, Jackson Healy (Oscar-winner Russell Crowe), and suffers a broken arm. Later, Healy comes back to see him, but now he wants his help. In the middle of all this mayhem, Holland's bossy daughter decides to help him out. Crowe plays it straight, while Gosling behaves like a buffoon or Bud Abbott. Amusing, polished, entertaining."

" The lethal two
",0.0,0.6652,2018-08-25 00:00:00,7,"Shane Black as a young man wrote the screenplay to the hard boiled buddy cop action film, Lethal Weapon.Black has since messed about with the formula making hard boiled mismatched buddy cop comedy action films laced with sleaze.This is a retro comedy drama set in Los Angeles of 1977. A young washed up private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired to find Amelia by her aunt. Amelia has got muscle for hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to stop him which he does by breaking Holland's wrist.When two hoods break into Healy's place, he hires March to find what is going on. Accompanied by March's bright and ethically centred daughter, they stumble on a conspiracy that involves the Justice department, the auto industry, the death of a porn actress and reel of a porn movie that exposes a scandal.The Nice Guy's comes across as an unpretentious fun film. There are nods to Black's previous films, it can be crude in places, the story can be a bit vague but it did make me laugh a lot. Although set in 1977 it is rather anachronistic in places."

Shane Black does a tremendous job of setting up a non-dumb plot with some really memorable lines in between, all of which you will attempt to retain and put to use as soon as you can.

Mr. Gosling finally shows his acting abilities (pretty good, for that matter) and Mr. Crowe' s art is not affected by aging. On the contrary. He does not have to be some Roman general to do his job with excellency. Story is a bit mumbo-jumbo, but direction is good. Also, the Australian girl (Angourie Rice) has a bright future, if she does not blow it. Yaya DaCosta is beautiful and Ms. Basinger still has it. All in all, worth your time. Go for it."

" Shane Black successfully mines the buddy-cop film formula he helped create
",0.6486,0.9977,2018-07-17 00:00:00,8,"Terrifically fun buddy-cop film throwback from writer/director Shane Black, one of the folks responsible for establishing the 80s action films subgenera with ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""The Last Boy Scout."" Set in a scuzzy Boogie Nights looking 1970s L.A., an unlikely duo of smart down on his luck P.I. Holland March, Ryan Gosling, and dimwitted hired thug Jackson Healy, a scene stealing Russell Crowe, form an uneasy alliance in trying to find a missing porn actress named Misty Mountains. From there the plot gets more serpentine and complicated, but what makes this film so fun and worth watching is the banter between Gosling and Crowe, where you get hilariously throwaway moments like:Holland March: Look on the bright side. Nobody got hurt.
Jackson Healy: People got hurt.
Holland March: I'm saying, I think they died quickly. So I don't think they got hurt.OrJackson Healy: So, you know the old lady, right? Did you believe her?
Holland March: What about?
Jackson Healy: When she said she saw Misty alive that night, did you believe her?
Holland March: God, no. She's blind as a bat.
Jackson Healy: Uh-huh.
Holland March: She has actual coke bottles for glasses. You paint a mustache on a Volkswagen, she says, ""Boy, that Omar Sharif sure runs fast.""OrJackson Healy: The place reeks of marijuana. They're smoking it.
Holland March: I can't smell.
Jackson Healy: What?
Holland March: I got hit in the head a while back. I lost my sense of smell.
Jackson Healy: You can't smell?
Holland March: Yeah.
Jackson Healy: You're a detective, and you can't smell?
Holland March: Yeah.
Jackson Healy: Aw, this just keeps getting better and better.
Holland March: Wow, that's really insensitive.Gosling and Crowe have a great chemistry that cries out for a sequel to happen so audiences can enjoy their future adventures in this sleazy 1970s coke filled version of Los Angels (although the film was sadly a box office disappointment). The other standout performer is Angourie Rice, playing Gosling's quick witted and smart-mouthed daughter Holly (reminiscent of Danielle Harris' character in Black's ""The Last Boy Scout"" as Bruce Willis' smart-mouthed daughter), who has some great banter herself with Crowe's Jackson when she finds out what he does for a living:Holly March: You beat people up and charge money?
Jackson Healy: Yeah.
Holland March: Sad, isn't it?
Holly March: How much would you charge to beat up my friend Janet?
Holland March: What?
Jackson Healy: How much you got?
Holly March: Thirty bucks.
Holland March: That's good, this conversation is over.Holly also has some hilarious father/daughter interaction as well, such as when she hides out in the trunk of the car to follow Gosling and Crowe to coke filled party populated with adult film stars and observes:Holly March: Dad, there's like whores here and stuff.
Holland March: Sweetheart, how many times have I told you? Don't say ""and stuff"". Just say ""Dad, there are whores here"".
Holly March: Well, there's like a ton.That last interaction leads to a great callback later in the film when Holly is talking to a young adult film actress that's too inappropriate to repeat here, but it's probably the biggest laugh of the film. Overall, ""The Nice Guys"" is charmingly retro, from it's use of the 1970s Warners Bros. logo at the film's opening to the fabulous cars and costumes to a fun soundtrack, it all gives the the feel of a politically incorrect R-rated version of The Rockford Files. Keith David, Lois Smith, Gil Gerard, and Kim Basinger also appear in the film."

The main two actors did make a decent duo, and the non-Crowe one is a good comedic actor, probably the only good thing in this movie.But overall it was a waste of time, the plot was unengaging and only some of the slapstick humor worked. Most of the movie was just frustrating double-standards at play and boring Crowe talking with his fantastic emotional range of a saltshaker.And don't forget, hurting men is funny!

Pathetic jokes that flop, and desperate attempts to shock with pointless nudity, are what this film is all about. Supposedly set in the 70's it even fails at that; the movie looks patently 2016. It tries to be sexy and comes across as pathetic. I'm sure this one scored points at frat houses throughout America. As a fan of everything 70's, this movie made me kind of sick. Definitely the worst thing Gosling has ever attached himself too, and Russell Crowe's career remains firmly in the toilet with this one.

This is one of the best comedies in recent years and everyone seems to agree with me. I'm reminded of what made films like ""Hot Shots: Part Deux"" so funny was because the main characters play the goofy series straight. That's exactly what Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling do here. We get our first great joke of the movie when a car crashes through a house. What's great is that there's so much going on in this movie.You just have no idea what will show up next. The one moment that really made me jump in my seat was when a giant bee appeared in the backseat! It's a dream, by the way. There's all sorts of jokes used here, although slapstick comes off as the most prominent. The weird thing is that I saw the first half of this movie on an airplane. I was watching this weird edited version for some reason. Why would a movie shown on an airplane screen be edited? You're the only one who hears it! The few moments where the characters yell are especially funny because they're usually so calm. It's hard to make a good comedy two hours long, but they have enough jokes to support the whole running time. I wish this movie had become as popular as something like ""Borat"". It might just be the funniest film of this entire decade. ****"

I definitely need to write down what I thought of this movie because it wasn't really worth remembering and I am sure I will forget. There was nothing really special about this buddy cop movie (or buddy detective whatever). Comparing it to ones I really like, like Lethal Weapon this one falls flat, but gets a 7 because its better than what goes for a 6 these days. It has it's entertaining moments, but found the villian was flat, the ending was meh. The only thing that really carried it was the backdrop (the 70's) and the Crowe and Gossling. That was about it.

Typically, I often find that (especially action and romance movies) in movies there is something missing. I can't put my finger on it exactly but they aren't the same as what they used to be, and not made the way they used to be. With that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with The Nice Guys. This movie brings back the action police-mafia-chase that we all missed. Character backstory somewhat lacks compared to what we've become used to, but that is all fine because it puts more attention to the mystery at hand. The plot is the main point, and it follows the characters who are dealing with it. Ryan Gosling and Russel Crow have amazing chemistry and it's refreshing to watch them. Borderline slapstick comedy at times, good stunts, and an engaging plot line. Put simply, it's as if Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run had a baby."
" Good film, too much UNNECESSARY profanity
",0.4404,0.9574,2018-05-30 00:00:00,8,"Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are paired in a crime thriller set in 1970s Los Angeles which contains more than its fair share of laughs.Private detective Holland March, engaged on a missing person case, is warned off when hired muscle Jackson Healy beats him up. The two are forced to join forces to search for Amelia, who has become involved in porn - sorry, make that ""experimental movies.""Shane (Iron Man 3) Black directs and co-writes this period crime thriller in which Ryan Gosling is March and a rather tubby Russell Crowe is Healy. A tolerable crime thriller plot engages the attention throughout, while this pair stumble their way through the search for Amelia. Neither is especially good at their job but fortunately (or, perhaps, unfortunately), March's 13-year old daughter Holly takes it upon herself to assist them from time to time.That's not all, though. If you've seen the trailer, you will know that, although this film has a serious plot, not everything about the delivery is straight-faced. The humour includes some funny dialogue and some great knockabout business and I was delighted to discover that Gosling, who I have previously found to be rather expressionlessly one-note in his previous work, has a definite flair for comedy. I chuckled often, and laughed out loud several times.Yet the jeopardy is quite real, and isn't played for laughs. There is always some genuine danger involved, which means you have an emotional investment in these two well-meaning but somewhat inept sleuths.The action is well-staged, the period feel is authentic (starting with the opening music, very Shaft-theme), Crowe and Gosling have an effective on-screen chemistry, and the cast are all good, especially Angourie Rice, who plays March's daughter Holly. She holds the screen whenever she's on it: keep your eye on her career, she's going places.If I was to criticise, I would say that there is relatively little substance here: the engaging performances and witty script elevate the film above its natural level. And the profanity in it doesn't always service the storytelling: there is much swearing which is here for no other reason than Because F*ck.But this is an entertaining movie with much in it to justify recommendation."

Unfortunately, this kind of film needs a somewhat large budget to re-create that era and since it's not a teen sex comedy or one with the current trend of comedy actors doing their shtick, it doesn't draw in the big crowds Hollywood brass hunger for to declare it a ""hit"". Like Black's previous similar buddy-buddy comedy, KISS KISS BANG BANG, this kind of film picks up speed audience wise in the secondary market like Netflix, etc. and becomes a ""cult"" classic.

The script is great, there is a lot of good humour in the script . Very good characters who have been given backstories in a way which feels natural rather than just put in the movie to make us care for the characters.The backstories are great . The actors playing the characters are great . Both Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling are great . Nicely executed twists make a movie which is great."

" Film Noir for the Disco Era
",0.0,0.9961,2017-11-26 00:00:00,10,"An unlikely duo must team up to find a missing girl before a secret cabal has her murdered in The Nice Guys (2016), a comedic crime drama written by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi and directed by Shane Black. Set in 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys is a film noir for the disco era, but wasn't originally written as a period piece. Thankfully, the writers decided to rework the concept and what resulted was one of the best films of 2016.Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a muscle-for-hire who Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley) pays to dissuade private detective Holland March (Ryan Gosling) from looking for her. March, an alcoholic who lives with his preteen daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice), believes Amelia is somehow connected to the death of porn star Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio). Misty's aunt, Mrs. Glenn (Lois Smith), hired March to investigate Misty's death because she believed Misty might still be alive.When two anonymous men (Beau Knapp and Keith David) show up at Jackson Healy's apartment to press him for details on Amelia's whereabouts, he decides to pay March to help him locate Amelia before they do. Together, they discover Amelia and Misty were connected to an underground adult film allegedly exposing a conspiracy on the part of auto manufacturers to suppress the catalytic converter. Several people involved in the movie turned up dead.Things get really complicated when Amelia's mother, Judith (Kim Basinger), a prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice, pays March and Healy to find her daughter. When Amelia literally falls into their laps, she accuses her mother of being part of the conspiracy. March and Healy slowly put the pieces together, but will they rescue her and the last remaining film reel in time to expose the truth? Nice Guys was loosely inspired by true events, although it wasn't advertised as such. Because of its particular geography, Los Angeles has long suffered from lingering smog, which was a pervasive problem in the mid-twentieth century. The film pokes fun at activists protesting ""bird killing"" pollution, but people really did wear gas masks to protest LA smog and it did have negative and long-term consequences for public health.Auto emissions were a contributing factor to airborne toxins until 1975 when the Environmental Protection Agency mandated all new cars come equipped with a catalytic converter. GM, Ford, and Chrysler (the ""Big Three"") agreed to research pollution-reducing technologies in 1953 but dragged their heels. The Justice Department filed an anti-trust case against the Big Three in 1968, alleging a conspiracy to suppress pollution-reducing technologies. So the events that formed a backdrop for the film occurred years before the film takes place.Nice Guys is more concerned with evoking the Zeitgeist of the decade rather than a strict adherence to facts. It was a brief time in American history when adult films were socially relevant. The 1970s are sometimes referred to as the ""Golden Age of Porn,"" when porn achieved some mainstream success with films like Deep Throat (1972) and The Devil in Miss Jones (1973). There were also widespread but unsubstantiated fears of Mafia influence in the adult film industry, which Judith uses as a red herring in this film.Nice Guys features several strong performances. Ryan Gosling is a Canadian actor with a long career in film and television, most notably in The Notebook (2004) and The Place Beyond the Pines (2012). In 2016, he also starred in La La Land, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. Holland March is a less serious role, demonstrating Gosling's versatility as an actor. Audiences and critics loved it. For this performance, he was nominated for ""Favorite Comedic Movie Actor"" at the People's Choice Awards and was awarded ""Best Comedic Performance"" by the San Diego Film Critics Society.Angourie Rice, a young Australian actress, had her breakout role in The Nice Guys. Since then, she's appeared in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), which was praised by audiences and critics, and The Beguiled (2017), which was not. Her character in The Nice Guys, Holly, is an adorably precocious child, insisting she can help her father solve the case (since her father is an incompetent drunk, who can blame her?). Like Natalie Portman in The Professional (1994), Angourie is perfect for the role, and hopefully will have a bright future in film.Nice Guys is funny, clever, and expertly manages a purposely convoluted and over-the-top plot ala The Big Lebowski (1998) and Fargo (1996). Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling perfectly play off each other's strengths, and bring a sense of ironic humor and style to an otherwise bleak and cynical world."

When porn star Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) dies in an wild automobile accident, it sets off an investigation for Amelia (?) who may or may not be Misty and may or may not be dead.

" A riot
",-0.5574,0.9887,2017-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Sometimes it's refreshing to just have fun. There's nothing else going on here, nothing pretentious, no ulterior motives, just a good yarn spun well. It is a straightforward film, in the best possible way - not shallow, just uncomplicatedly enjoyable. In the way it made me feel it reminded me of Baby Driver, which is high praise. It's pacy, it's sharp, at times it is genuinely hilarious, and it bounds along with the enthusiasm of a puppy through the brilliantly organised chaos of its subject and story. The chemistry between the leads is superb, and I can't think of a single performances that wasn't nailed. The only let down is the ending, which didn't quite live up to the rest of the film. It felt, if not quite cut short, then certainly lacking a little something. The rest of the film is such fun that it doesn't matter too much. 7.5/10"

" Stylish and Overlooked
",-0.0258,0.9675,2017-11-11 00:00:00,9,"The Nice Guys is described as a older style neo-noir type drama based upon during the 1970's. This film was released during the summer of 2016 and appeared to have been overshadowed and overlooked due to higher profile films, which is a shame since this film delivers in what people are looking for in these type of stylish crime mystery dramas. Compared to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (by the same director- Shane Black) and there are some similarities but with the Nice Guys, it shows growth from that film.What makes this film work is that the storyline is continuously energetic and entertaining, mainly due to the lead actors of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowed- their chemistry is what makes this film top notch. The clever and witty dialogue is there as well as the comedy and action. Nothing feels forced and the film does not drag on. Although, it was somewhat odd and different how the daughter was in as many scenes and had a big role as she did (arguably the third most screen time after Gosling and Crowe). Some complained that she ruined the film but one would get used to it. Overall the Nice Guys is one of the better crime dramas of last year, and we have a suspicious this film may develop a type of cult following."

" Not 'nice guys,' but nice film anyway
",-0.5667,0.9963,2017-09-01 00:00:00,7,"'The Nice Guys' has always appealed to me, simply by its front cover. I know you should never judge a book (or film!) on such superficial factors, but it just looked so damn cool. And, I'm pleased to say that it is. Maybe simply setting what it â€“ technically â€“ your pretty standard 'who-dunnit' crime caper in the seventies it hardly that new, but it just seems to work. It's about an 'enforcer' (Russell Crowe) and a private detective (Ryan Gosling) who have to team up in order to solve a crime. So, it's effectively your average mismatched 'buddy cop' movie, even though neither of the leads are police.When you try and 'sell' a movie like this, it's hard to really make it sound as good as it actually is. As I've already mentioned, everything about the set-up is nothing new and it's only real difference is that it's set around forty years ago instead of in present day, you may wonder what makes it worth watching. Well, I guess it's the chemistry between the two leads that makes it work so well. Crowe and Gosling really do play up the 'mismatched' element of the story to perfection. However, just because they're funny, doesn't really mean that I'd call this film a 'comedy.' The humour is all very 'black' and even when you're laughing out loud, it's probably because someone has just been hurt! I won't go into the plot too much, as with most 'who-dunnits' if you give away what and why they're investigating you run the risk of spoiling what's in store. I guess 'The Nice Guys' won't be for everyone. It's not just the humour that's dark. I mentioned that people get hurt and there some fights and actions scenes that are up there with the best of serious cop dramas and action movies. It's one of those films that splits genres. It's never only a comedy, action film or drama, yet it definitely displays elements of all of them. It's also too violent and adult in nature to be watched by younger audiences, so it's strictly for adults who enjoy their murder mysteries dark when a healthy dose of black humour.It's a great piece for both Crowe and Gosling who look like they're really enjoying themselves. And it shows. As I said, 'The Nice Guys' probably isn't for everyone, but hopefully it will at least gain a cult following that it deserves."
" THE NICE GUYS Deserves a Lot More Love
",0.8412,0.7451,2017-08-26 00:00:00,9,"The most overlooked, underrated movie from 2016 was, without a doubt, THE NICE GUYS. I saw it in theaters on the weekend after it opened in a small theater with no more than a dozen people total. The box office numbers for THE NICE GUYS were depressingly low, being siphoned away to the swarm of big budget blockbusters that, let's face it, weren't all that impressive that summer. I treated myself to a double feature that afternoon, starting with the latest X-MEN and closing out with THE NICE GUYS. Needless to say, Shane Black's retro detective buddy comedy was the far superior film and I just wish more people had given it the attention it deserved. We've got superhero movies hitting us from every direction; we've rebooting reboots; we're regurgitating old properties and turning toy brands into franchises. So when an amazing, original movie like THE NICE GUYS comes along we need to pay attention and give it the love it deserves. Why are we wasting theater space on yet another tired TRANSFORMERS installment but my chances of getting another round with March and Healy are low-to-none? I think the only, and I mean only, mistake this movie made was being released in May at the start of the summer movie season. If the studios have played it smart and released it in the winter when audiences aren't bombarded with two and a half hour CG explosions, this movie might've gotten the love it deserved. Because this movie is awesome.It's set in the '70s Los Angeles in the midst of the national gas crisis. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a sleazy private detective who finds himself teaming with the more honorable hired muscle Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) in getting to the bottom of a mystery revolving around a missing girl and a dead porn actress. THE NICE GUYS is equal parts action and comedy, with Gosling and Crowe giving what are probably my favorite performances from two actors I don't generally associate with comedy. March is an alcoholic who's still reeling from the death of his wife. He's raising his daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) alone and makes a living pursuing the sort of cases that might involve ripping off old ladies for on-going payments. Healy is a loner, living above a club with only his aquarium for company, who'll put the hurting on troublemakers for the right amount of cash. The two cross paths when Healy is hired to ""send a message"" to March to stop trailing a frightened young girl named Amelia (she's a person of interest in March's case). Soon Amelia goes missing and a couple of thugs (including Keith David because, as I mentioned, this movie is awesome) come terrorizing Healy in search of her; Healy recognizes there's someone with more sinister intentions pursing this girl and he turns to March for help in locating her. March reluctantly agrees and we're off on one of the best buddy action/comedies in decades from the writer of LETHAL WEAPON.The writing is sharp. The laughs are consistent. The action is brutal. THE NICE GUYS succeeds on every level. I would've never pegged Gosling or Crowe for these sort of semi-comedic roles but they nail it. I want to see a sequel with March and Healy on their first official case as a professional investigation duo, with Holly tagging along despite the mens' warnings in sort of a ""Penny in Inspector Gadget"" role. Holly is precocious for her age and acts as March's unofficial partner, meaning she's the sober one and keeps him on track. Angourie Rice keeps pace with the heavier hitters of the film and never falls into the pitfall of being ""the annoying child actor"" who ruins an otherwise fantastic movie. She's just as vital a team member. The conspiracy uncovered by the trio is complex without being convoluted and it makes for an interesting story built around the legitimate gas crisis the United States encountered in the era. It's a fun period piece from a fun period. We don't get enough period pieces from the '60s or '70s anymore so I love it when one comes along and, even better, when it's done well. THE NICE GUYS has everything you could want and I don't want to spoil much of anything so I'm trying to be sparse with the details, but I really encourage you to check this movie out if you haven't. By the end, I imagine you'll be aching for another go with the Nice Guys P.I.s as much as I am."
" The Nice Guys
",0.4215,0.9938,2017-08-26 00:00:00,8,"Shane Black has been known for his creative writing, clever use of violence and a knack for great humour, we've seen this in Lethal Weapon. This paired with superb characterization and great acting from both Russell Crowe (Jackson Healy) and Ryan Gosling (Holland March) provide the back bone for a fantastic movie. While the clichÃ© of the serious, hard hitting macho man paired with the witty, surprisingly smart side kick has been used and abused in many detective / cop comedies. The Nice Guys get away with it. The various interactions between March and Healy along with March's daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) are fresh and entertaining. Healy's seriousness is offset by a down in the dumps, depressed, drunken March whose inebriated antics and don't give a **** attitude will have you weak at the knees.The over the top nature continues to remind the viewer its a movie, the characters never really focused on the immanent and direct danger. This steals most of the serious tones and allows the viewer to take the film with a grain of salt. It plays off completely unnatural reactions to vastly unrealistic movie situations (as many action comedies do) yet at the same time throws in touches of realism that pulls things back into perspective without losing its comedic effect (e.g. the exceptional scene of March punching the glass and slitting his wrist).I know the previous paragraph is a clichÃ© for modern crime / action comedies (e.g. The Others Guys, Deadpool for example) however, The Nice Guys plays into a genuinely interesting and compelling plot that isn't afraid to push boundaries, woven in with a 70's theme that adds a brilliant extra dimension. Superb acting and hilarious characters keep it from being another ""passable movie."" So while the movie is a little bit clichÃ©d, it's refreshing, original, comedic take on a already strong movie formula will no doubt have you laughing. This paired with a great, original plot, keeps you entertained and captivated for the full 2 hours. Highly recommend this movie."
" Uneasy mix of comic non-sequiturs and violent noir proves tiresome
",-0.7579,-0.9833,2017-08-25 00:00:00,4,"Set in 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys stars a rather bloated and unkempt looking Russell Crowe as Jackson Healey, a tough enforcer who plays opposite Ryan Gosling as Holland March, an alcoholic private detective. March is hired by an old lady, Mrs. Glenn, who insists she saw her porn actress niece Misty, through the window of an apartment, despite the fact that Misty was killed in a car accident two days before. March gets on the trail of a mysterious young female, Amelia, who might be involved in Misty's disappearance. Healey is hired by Amelia to prevent March from finding her so he goes over to his house and beats him up. After Healey and March's initial dust-up, Healey is attacked by two thugs who are looking for Amelia. After fending them off, Healey joins forces with March to look for the missing instigator. While The Nice Guys is designed as a gritty film noir, it also unhappily features the comic machinations of the two principals whose dialogue is loaded with a series of non-sequiturs. If this is your cup of tea, then you'lli probably like The Nice Guys but I found Crowe and Gosling's comic interplay to be repetitious and grating.The rest of The Nice Guys plot is a bit convoluted to say the least. March, while in an alcoholic stupor, takes a pratfall over the railing in the back of a mansion where a party is going on, and ends up finding the corpse of Sid Shattuck, a porn producer who was involved with Amelia. Meanwhile, March's 12 year old daughter, Holly, is kidnapped by ""Blue Face,"" one of the two thugs who attempted to kill Healey earlier. Holly prevents Blue Face from killing Amelia while inside the car and manages to escape and flee with Amelia. Surprisingly Blue Face is seriously injured by a hit and run driver. Before strangling him to death, Blue Face tells Healey that a notorious hit man, John Boy, has been hired to take out Amelia.Also in the mix is Amelia's mother Judith (Kim Bassinger), a high- ranking Justice Department official who describes her daughter as unstable to both Healey and March. When the intrepid investigators bring Amelia back to March's house, they can't decide whether her tale of Detroit automaker collusion attempting to circumvent auto exhaust emission standards and her mother's involvement with them is true or whether Amelia is simply a spoiled brat with grand conspiracy theories. The ranting Amelia proves to be one of the more interesting characters in the film with a personality that appears to represent a satire on the over the top, leftist anti-government young people of today.In addition to Crowe and Gosling's failed comedy routine, The Nice Guys takes an even further turn for the worse by confirming Amelia's story that her mother Judith indeed colluded with the Detroit automakers. Judith sends her assistant, Tally, to divert Healey and March by giving them a briefcase to deliver that is supposedly filled with $100,000 cash, but actually contains shredded magazines. Meanwhile, in the most unpleasant scene in the movie, John Boy ends up killing Amelia.Healey and March finally figure out that the near-sighted Mrs. Glenn actually saw her niece in a movie that was being projected inside that apartment. It turns out that Amelia spliced in evidence of the Detroit automakers collusion into a film scheduled to be projected at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It's there that Healey and March engage in a wild shootout with the bad guys, one of whom dies and the other two apprehended.The Nice Guys disappoints grandly with the stereotyped depiction of Judith, the scheming Justice Department official, who is willing to sacrifice her daughter for the good of the American economy. I don't buy it in the least and you shouldn't either. With its uneasy mix of comedy and noir realism, The Nice Guys ends up trying to have it both ways. The killing of Amelia undercuts the comedy by introducing a tragic element too overbearing for a seemingly light-heartedly designed vehicle."

Watching it I bounced between enjoyment and annoyance. Overall though, it ended up frustrating me.I assumed this was going to be a detective procedural. That's how it starts out, and the first half of the film builds up a puzzle/mystery that drew me in and, normally, should have led somewhere. Then around the half way mark it drops that idea and in favor of ... well, stuff.Maybe this one got hacked to bits in the editing suite, maybe it was just put together incompetently but the end result is a mess. It starts out as Get Carter, ends as Beverly Hills Cop, with bits of the A-Team and Boogie Nights spliced in for good measure. It's hard to stay on board for the ride."

Not with this film. Both characters have a similar past (problems with alcohol) and they both have this funny personality that works perfectly when they're together.

Enough said about that, let's get to the review.Synopsis: Set against the backdrop of 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys opens when single father and licensed PI Holland March (Gosling) is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of famous porn star Misty Mountains. As the trail leads him to track down a girl named Amelia (Qualley), he encounters less licensed and less hands-off private eye Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) and his brass knuckles, both hired by the young hippie. However, the situation takes a turn for the worse when Amelia vanishes and it becomes apparent that March wasn't the only party interested. As both men are forced to team up, they'll have to take on a world filled with eccentric goons, strippers dressed as mermaids and even a possible government conspiracy. Starring: Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling Director: Shane BlackThe Ugly: Okay, in this movie Gosling is supposed to be an alcoholic. You have to look really close to see it. Why they kept it hidden in the movie is beyond me. It could have given the movie so much more.The Bad: Much like the alcoholism, early in the movie you have to look to see what the main story going forward is all about. It does come to light, but it takes about thirty to forty minutes to find out what is going on. You don't even see the main villain in Matt Bomer until the last thirty minutes of the movie. But that's okay because of the ""good.""The Good: As I said above, Shane Black did it again. He made a great movie based off one of his scripts. Yes, he wanted this to be a TV series, but Fox wanted Lethal Weapon. So he made this into a movie. That's okay, I don't think it could have been done without the two main actors. They played so well off each other. Ryan and Russell were comedy gold in this movie. Russell as the enforcer is always a golden ticket. And the ""buddy cop"" aspect in Los Angeles is a staple for Black. Why mess with almost perfection?Final Thoughts: Everyone needs to watch this movie. Everyone. For you youngsters under seventeen, you best be asking your parent's permission, as there is quite a bit of language and nudity. Can't wait for Black's The Predator.Rating: 8 out of 10"
" A funnier version of Lethal Weapon
",0.128,0.9972,2017-07-24 00:00:00,10,"I saw 'The Nice Guys' just when it came out since it was coming from the same writer as the original Lethal Weapon movie, (while not to mention the two lead actors are from Canada and NZ) one has to wonder if that same magic has been captured again in this weird looking ""buddy movie"" or not, right? The 1970's: Captured 90% but Recreated 200%.Set in 1970's Los Angeles, The Nice Guys sees a pair of detectives hunting down information in relation to a missing porn star, who's disappeared from the public eye in what appears to be a suicide. Sounds pretty standard, right? Like any good plot, there's a massive conspiracy going on underneath the surface.When they first meet on screen, Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) assaults his (soon to be) partner, Holland March (Ryan Gosling). This important scene sets the tone for what is to come later, as the two, who both exude a strong screen presence, have a natural chemistry with one another.It's like a remake of The Classic Odd Couple as Nice Guys, starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe - while you might get a turn-off instantly just by looking at the poster or the mediocre trailer but take my advice: go for it! Laugh your arse of with some real laugh out loud moments in this movie.Shane Black, famed for another buddy cop movie in Lethal Weapon, has managed to recreate some magic in terms of entertainment and straight out fun. Perhaps his re-pairing with Lethal Weapon producer, Joel Silver, helps here somewhat.Both Crowe and Gosling play their roles well, and believably so at that. Russell Crowe has always been believable as a hard man in movies, and he is well cast here. Gosling, on the other hand, has a wide variety of roles behind him that are memorable, and this is another that can be added to that long list.But as under-rated as it is, it is filled with truly hysterical moments, several bits of physical comedy that Gosling pulls off throughout the movie, combined with the excellent straight man work by Crowe, the two actors become a surprisingly brilliant comedy duo, carrying ""The Nice Guys"" past one or two flat jokes, needed edits and a cluttered finale."

",0.4927,0.9828,2017-07-22 00:00:00,8,"Los Angeles, 1978. Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a private investigator, of sorts. He is the man you call when someone needs to be given a message, violently. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is more legit, and conventional, taking cases involving tracking down missing persons and the like. Their paths cross when porn star Misty Mountains dies in a car crash. Misty's aunt hires March after she believes that Misty is still alive. Their investigations lead them to a young woman named Amelia, and a massive conspiracy plot. Ostensibly a crime-drama, but far more than that. Very funny, with some very tight, clever dialogue. Some scenes and punch-lines are screamingly funny. Very edgy too - certainly doesn't pull its punches.However, as a drama, it's less good. The crime plot is okay, and was initially very intriguing. However, after a while it falls back on fairly conventional developments and contrivances. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are great in the lead roles, showing wonderful comedic delivery and timing. 15-year old Angourie Rice almost steals the show as March's daughter and delivers on the promise she showed in These Final Hours. Casting Kim Bassinger opposite Russell Crowe was a masterstroke as the plot does have an LA Confidential sort of vibe."

I think Gosling & Crowe (was this some feeble homage to MST3K?) are terrific performers. But the hodgepodge ""tributes"" to 1970s movies (mostly Blaxploitaion flicks) & TV shows (mostly Rockford Files) are so lame & disjointed it would be an advantage not to be familiar with the culture or the language.The film starts off at a good pace & moves at a good clip until just short of the one hour mark. Then the humor becomes painfully predictable & the plot (what there is of it) disintegrates into a million bits like an exploding pillow. Most annoying of all is the character of Ryan Gosling's daughter. Lord knows what she's doing in this but suddenly we're in Nancy Drew country.Oh well there's a big market overseas & I guess they never tire of buddy cop/private eye movies."

It's also the Thursday evening 90's action movie, which you watch in parts as you flip between the channels on your TV because you can't decide if you want to watch this movie, the show on National Geographic or The Peacekeeper that's just starting.It is a polished buddy cop action movie with excellent performances from most actors. The little girl who plays the daughter of one of the detectives is adorable. The costumes look good. The camera work is clean, without shaky cam, and the action is appropriately dumb, as it tries to imitate the bad action movies of the 80s and 90s. However, beyond the basic quality, there is not much to this movie. There is no major depth to any of the characters; there is no central respectable bad guy; the script is not that smart (appropriately of course, as far as 90's action movies go); and there is no big twist. The story is a murder investigation.I liked the film and I want to see more of these guys. It's time for a good buddy-cop show. But as a one-off, this is somewhat unremarkable."

",-0.1556,0.97,2017-07-03 00:00:00,1,"Geez, what is wrong with the people who green light these kinda projects? I honesty try to imagine what was going on: a group of people - the director, main actors, writers, producers sitting at a large table in some conference room, looking over the script, joking with each other, asking how are we gonna do this that and the other, and then slapping each other on the back and saying ""this is gonna be great!"". I imagine its something like that. Then, after all the shoots are done, editing and sound, they sit in a cozy and luxurious little screening room with big leather seats and couches and view their product. Of course its not funny, interesting, compelling. Its a dog turd. Expect nobody is gonna say it. All the ""yes men"" are gonna blow smoke up everyone's ass and say how great it is and that its gonna make millions. Of course, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling aren't there. They've done their job, their bank accounts have been credited the millions they contracted for, and they're onto their next project or sitting on a beach somewhere, a private beach, sipping some fancy drink with a little umbrella in it. And they're laughing. Laughing because they themselves know this was a crapfest of a movie. Sure they did their best acting, these guys always do. They're professionals and they're good. However, when you have a collaborative venture, you're only as strong as the weakest link. And the chain breaks apart with the director and the writers. You can read all the other reviews that give their technical reasons why the movie was bad. I'm in agreement. It wasn't funny. Mixing sexual situations with children is borderline criminal here, and the story was convoluted, muddy, and strange. I only lasted until the one clown that had the dye pack explode on his face was killed and the young girl then holds his hand. I'm only writing that so as to let you know I did watch this. Up until that point. Then I cut my losses and wandered off. Such a waste of Crowe and Gosling's talents. My advice - if you want to have fun and be entertained, go eat an apple. Way more fun and entertaining than this garbage movie. And its healthy for you too."

Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling's chemistry on screen made the film stand out from other buddy cop movies. Their quick wit and love hate relationship worked well on screen, creating some very funny moments.The film is at it's best when these 2 are on screen together, they keep the film flowing and the dialogue written is perfect for the character's created. The story itself turned out to be better than i expected, the trailers really didn't give away the main plot points.Although Gosling and Crowe gave brilliant performances, Angourie Rice stole the scenes she was in and for such a young actress she gave a funny and multi layered performance. She provided a lot of comic relief and, unlike most child characters, she served a valuable purpose in the film, which again is a credit to the writer.The only criticism of the film would be that the plot can sometimes get confusing and requires you to be concentrating at all times. i would defiantly say the first half of the film is better than the second, however both are very entertaining. Overall, it is a solid buddy cop movie and shows there still is life for the genera"

The movie tried to be funny, tried to show nudity, tried to show some brutal action, but in the process, the movie became just a collection of random videos one after one. The plot is just awful, and the character development is almost non-existent. Action scenes are unbelievable, maybe the whole movie was a dark comedy. There were funny dialogues here and there, but I cannot remember laughing for a single moment. Sometimes, I felt that maybe the movie is made for child audience who would never ask about the plot holes and just enjoy whatever comes before them.This movie does not deserve so much high rating. And I desperately wish that such high caliber actors like Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling would skip such horrible movie. Few scenes of Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling were somewhat good, but those never make the movie worthy to see. Totally a forgettable movie.Please IMDb, fix the rating. Many good movies are in 6.something rating, whereas this lousy movie is enjoying such a high rating. You really need to fix the system or people like me will lose trust on you guys."

Once again, a Hollywood movie where recreational drug use, drinking and the porn industry are displayed as less socially damaging than money, industry and car emissions. Lots of action, some funny moments and lots of profanity and a number of scenes of topless female nudity. Just not worth the time. One day I hope that Hollywood will take inventory on the number of dead celebrities related to drugs and alcohol and the amount of sex crimes related to pornographic addictions and come up with a new plot line."

The supporting cast does well, especially Gosling's daughter who holds her own against the two stars. Criticisms are the confusion around the story and murder. The plot has a few holes and doesn't flow so well. Your still piecing together what actually happened and why. When you do get some sort of picture it doesn't really make sense. This film's strong points are its comedy and delivery. It excels with its funny moments and the two male leads have great personalities that work well together.

They wind up searching for a porno star who has evidence that the auto industry is deliberately lying about polluting the air in Los Angeles. The MacGuffin is a reel of porno film that has the recorded evidence of the conspiracy spliced into its midsection. Something like that.What it boils down to is a lot of chases on foot and in cars, considerable blood letting, and a Mount Everest of wisecracks, mostly of the Rated-R quality. The whole production, set in Los Angeles, is colorful and wacky because the time is the early 70s. Terms like ""reefer"" and ""Mary Jane"" are flung about with abandon and we get to listen to the Strawberry Orange Peel or whatever the band was.If you intend to enjoy this film, it's best to follow the advice of the Roman philosopher Seneca and not expect too much, so you won't be disappointed by some of the rheumatic gags. As the film opens we see Goslings hungover face in the bath tub. When he tumbles out, we see he's wearing a suit. It was hilarious in ""Some Like It Hot."" The film achieves its goal, which is undemanding amusement. Gosling becomes Lou Costello to Crowe's Bud Abott. Rice is Gosling's thirteen-year-old blonde, blue-eyed daughter. She's extremely pretty and delivers a nice performance. It may also be Gosling's best. It's nice to see him as a comic loser rather than a cocky young man. Crowe is now bulky, lumpy, and fearsome as ever.Well, LA WAS pretty polluted back in the early 70s. It's much better now, whereas China, whose families have switched from using the methane from pig dropping as cooking fuel, to coal, has become far worse. If you're in a Chinese city, you may not be able to see the end of the block. However, they are aware of the problem and struggling with it. It's a serious problem but we'll have to bracket that thought in order to enjoy the laughs."
" Atypic Hollywood Originality; A Clever, new take on the buddy/P.I. film
",0.4588,0.9904,2017-05-25 00:00:00,9,"To begin, it's one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated films of the last several years (even decades in the genre). Period. And by that, I mean not a great success at the box office, even though it was very* well-reviewed by critics and audiences, alike. If you haven't seen it because you are weary of the beleaguered and hackneyed buddy-cop/P.I. films (ever since Lethal Weapon started the endless cloning process), you must* see this. It's got loads more to offer,from its kitschy 70's pop culture setting (Including some memorably awful hair, clothes, and Nixon.), a 'groovy'soundtrack filled with 70s Pop & R&B music..but much more. Gosling, charming as always, is the n'er-do-well, boozy, bungling P.I., adored by his oft-disappointed and precocious daughter. He stumbles on a case (deemed initially, at least, as unsolvable but an easy paycheck) offered first by the worried Grandma of an assumed- deceased porn star, and then another case offered by a tough-guy- for-hire/washed-up but capable P.I., (played appealingly by Russell Crowe in one of his best comedy roles, ever) -who is looking for another missing girl.Eventually (of course! - and we are grateful) they join forces, stumbling into a wider plot that links the two missing women. Along the way, yes, as the genre insists: mishaps and humor. But refreshing, more sarcastic, less broad humor. And more finesse means better laughs- as Hitchcock found that less gore brings greater terror. This duo is 'fab' chemistry. It's enjoyable, more believable, and such** a relief from the formulaic action films endlessly put forth on CGI-laden cookie-cutter releases that gross 10x more, sadly.Word is the Director, Gosling and Crowe are on board for a sequel; but the studios are dragging their greedy little feet, because the modestly successful box office of Nice Guys takes a back seat to 45 more Pixar/CGI/ or the ubiquitous 'Boys or Girls' Night Out-with hilarious result'..films. Note to Hollywood: We NEED this film. We NEED another. Please??"

The little girl is fun, too. Shane knows this genre and is able to twist it in interesting ways. The story is engaging enough to follow and this is simply fun."
" Shane Black points his gun at the 70's and misfires
",-0.34,-0.9907,2017-04-17 00:00:00,2,"""The Nice Guys"" is too self indulgent and arrogant to be loved. It's another example of how great screenwriters prove they are mediocre directors. Shane Black needed a Richard Donner or a Tony Scott to coral and police his scripts into something cinematic. Black appears way too in love with his own words, which is nauseating. Stylistically it looks great, but the tone flounders and fails.In regards to ""The Nice Guys"", there is a smugness that shines through from the movie's worst character, the 13-year-old daughter of Ryan Gosling. Don't recall the name, because I just don't care. There's nothing more annoying in a movie, than a child character filled with grown up characteristics. To me, that's lazy writing. Anybody can just slap some adult qualities into an underage character in hopes for a cheap laugh or for a ""look at how clever I am"" reaction. The character was unnecessary and distracted from what could've been something fun. Are we really supposed to believe that she's going to help them solve the mystery of a dead porn star? On paper, she was probably born in Shane Black's mind as ""A 'Nancy Drew' character who sits through a porn film with adults, while being the voice of reason with adults, while holding dying bad guys hands and telling them everything is going to be okay, and then thinking nothing of talking about anal sex and seeing dead bodies... and oh yeah, leaning against a wall, arms crossed with a smug smile on her face when she's got it all figured out."" She put the final nail in the coffin of this movie for me. Ryan Gosling is forced to act stupid, and every chance he tries to be funny, you feel every strain of his acting ability to sell what Shane Black has written, but it comes across as embarrassingly bad. When Gosling finds the body and he tries to scream for Russell Crowe's help... trying to be funny... it falls flat. When he wigs out and sees the talking killer bee... to seeing Nixon swimming... It all falls as flat and unfunny as the dead body they inexplicably throw over the fence. NOT FUNNY. Why did they dump the body in the first place? Why not call the cops? Oh, that's right, Black came up with the cheap gag of a dead body landing on a family outdoor dinner party, and then had to figure out a way to use that within the plot. A good trailer moment, perhaps was the intention, but it failed. Russell Crowe just looks sad in this movie. Is that really all he could bring to the table? His character looked as bored as Crowe probably was making the movie. His character had absolutely nothing memorable about him. He was no Martin Riggs or Joe Hallenbeck by a long stretch. Hell, I can't even remember a single line of dialogue he spoke, he was so forgettable. Finally and most off-putting about the entire movie, was the repeated inclusion of children and sexual situations. Some not so bad, some are cringe worthy and head shaking. Here's the list: A kid taking his father's dirty magazine. (That's fine, it happens) The kid walks up on the naked woman, which we clearly see the child actor standing over the naked adult actress. (Was that necessary?) A young 13-year-old girl buying pot and hanging around a creepy older guy, likely for sex. (At least this was handled better with Russell Crowe punching the guy in the face.) A young foulmouthed kid on a bike bragging about his ""big dick"" and offering to show it for money. (Is that necessary? It wasn't funny. It was as if Shane Black spent too much time watching ""Boogie Nights"" and tried to show an underage Dirk Diggler on a bike.) Then Gosling's daughter says ""Rim job"" which is of course the act of licking an anus. (Did we need to hear her say that? It wasn't that funny.) Now we have the girl watching a stag film around adults as if that's perfectly normal. She even mentions anal sex. REALLY???? (She would've shown more maturity if she looked away from the porn and was more like ""I don't think I should be watching this kind of thing yet, might give me the wrong idea."" That would've been not so cringe worthy.) All of this got me thinking, just what in the hell was Shane Black and his co-writer thinking when they wrote this? Did they really want to rely on children mixed with porn as a source of humor? Very strange territory, unless it's done in a more serious manner. Here, it's done as if there's nothing wrong with it and it's okay for kids to watch porn and talk about sex WITH ADULTS. In private, with their peers, that's one thing, but when you start crossing the line, things get uncomfortable and Black never rectifies this issue by the end. He was writing a 70's period piece but in the atmosphere of today's kids who are far too desensitized to sex, thanks to the internet. Had this been present day, it may have worked as an indictment of our current culture, but instead it comes across as Black using it for shocks and laughs without consequences. Shane Black spent way too much time enjoying large party set pieces and reveling in the 70's atmosphere, then creating memorable characters, and it shows. He struggled to sell the script for more than a decade and without a $1.2 billion blockbuster ""Iron Man 3"" under his belt, he never would have have sold it. Apparently the main reason he did ""Iron Man 3"",was so he could bankroll this glossy, 70's, fever dream, pulp novel,smug fest that was ""The Nice Guys"""

The story is a bit weird sometimes, with quite a bit of violence and sometimes a bit of nudity. There are funny scenes enough to class it as a comedy even though it's more about action.

Most of what I had seen before seemed great. A mutual from tumblr seems to like this movie and constantly reblogs GIF-sets and screencaps from this movie. All that dialogue seemed wild and fun, so I thought it'd be right up my alley.An almost constant thought that followed me through the movie was ""this reminds me of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". No wonder, since it's directed by the same guy. Shane Black really handles neo-noir films very well. Few especially great details were the internal monologues at the beginning of the movie. They were like straight from old time-y film noirs, but way more fun. The plot was way more intriguing than anticipated. From the screenshots and GIF-sets The Nice Guys seemed more like a comedy than actually thrilling crime mystery. The plot is complex, and it's actually very satisfying and entertaining to see how the story goes, what was going on, all that.One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the 70's aesthetic and music. I've always had a soft spot for 70's fashion, so movies from the past few years set in the 70's are great at least aesthetically speaking.The Nice Guys is definitely a fun, thrilling movie, tho I am sceptical if it would be as good the second time."

Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a cop who following his wife's death became a drunk. He would become a P.I. who takes on weird cases. He is currently working for a woman who wants him to prove that her niece a porn actress is alive when everyone knows she died recently. His investigation takes him to a girl named Amelia who avoids him. She then hires Healey to tell him to leave her alone which he does. But later some guys go to Healey and want to know where Amelia is. When he handles them, he asks March to help him find Amelia. They learn that Amelia's boyfriend, a film maker was killed and his house was burned down along with the film. They later learn the Porn star's producer is also dead. So what is going on.???Plus Points:1)Casting: The Nice Guys would not be the same without Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.These two Superstars of Hollywood teamed up in a most unusual way for this crime comedy and surprisingly they are freaking awesome.There is a scene in this movie where both Russell and Ryan goes in an elevator and when they reach the floor they find a guy with his throat cut and some firing going on.They immediately goes back into the lift for escaping from it.Their expressions in that scene are enough to prove that both of them are not only stars of emotional or kick ass movies.Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are nothing short of perfect. A subtle goofball/straight-man line is drawn between them within their individual approaches to the case, and the back and forth between them is magical, often managing to be blissfully goofy while always remaining grounded and real. Angourie Rice as Holly March,daughter of Gosling is very good and her acting is on par with the legends.2)Screenplay and Direction: Shane Black did not write any out of the box script or anything.Its just a simple detective buddies investigating a mysterious girl related to the death of a famous porn star. But the way he wrote the funny dialogues and situations are excellent.There are lot of hilarious situations in this film.As a director, Black also demonstrates a fantastic eye for visual comedy, be it Holland struggling to handle a gun, a magazine, and a lit cigarette simultaneously while in a bathroom stall, or Holland and Jackson stepping out of an elevator to an incredibly violent scene. From the movie's opening shot, taking the audience up and over the dilapidated Hollywood sign, Black ensconces you in The Nice Guys' noir world, and you really don't want to let it go by the time the credits roll.3)Music: There is this funky music playing in the background helped the movie a lot.So,The Nice Guys is awesome and the credit entirely goes to the unexpectedly hilarious performances of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.Loved u bothMy rating 7.5/10"

",0.0,0.997,2017-02-11 00:00:00,5,"The Nice Guys has two of my favorite actors in it, so I couldn't let it pass, especially this being a comedy and action movie, something that Crow & Gosling rarely play.Perhaps, I was expecting too much, so I felt a feel deflated after watching this film. Overall, I found it entertaining, with some truly funny moments, but not always engaging, with a poor script and poor edition, and uneven performances.The Nice Guys revolves about an unlikely couple of funny private investigators, so if the actors playing those roles don't click on camera and they are not on the same page, the whole movie is affected by a domino effect. I felt that this was the case here, at times there was true chemistry between them, but none at others. Also, I found Gosling quite funny, but Crow not that funny. To this, you have to add that the dialogues go from plain and boring to witty and fun, some of the scenes are really great but others a bit bad, so it was up and down up and down like a carousel with mechanical hiccups.The film needed of a better script and edition, because some scenes were superfluous and didn't add anything to the story, while others seemed to be there for no reason, not well explained, like disconnected from something that was going to be explained but it never was. I liked the character of Holly and Angourie Rice is one of the best things in the film; however, I'm not sure that the character was really necessary.I was thrilled to see Bassinger in the film, but since this is a comic action movie you need a bit of a caricature of the heroes and baddies to make you laugh; her acting was good per se, but I don't think appropriate for the comedic tone of the film, probably because the script wasn't 'there' either.I found the production quite good overall, especially good for interior design and references to music and film culture of the 70s; however, I found some of the dresses and jeans not that 70s, like they didn't have enough flare! The same re some of the hairdos.I don't want to be hyper-critical, as I enjoyed the film overall, but it also let me underwhelmed and feeling that all the elements for success were there, but they were mixed in the wrong way."
" Worst movie I've ever seen
",-0.6249,0.977,2017-02-03 00:00:00,2,"Literally the worst movie I've ever seen. I gave it 2 stars out of 10 because of the girl who plays the daughter. She was excellent. There were no other redeeming qualities to this movie.Note to Directors: Russell Crowe is not a comedian and should never be cast in a comedy again! He and Gossling tried to be like Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in Wedding Crashers, but it failed miserably. Their prolonged back and forth banter was not funny and provided no comedy. Crowe was completely miscast. He is too serious and monotone, and lacks any comedic whit to pull off the part. Gossling fared only slightly better, but had no chemistry with Crowe.There was little situational comedy to offset the horrible dialogue. The attempts at comedy were slapstick with Gossling acting like a goofball, or with the teenage daughter reciting graphic pornographic acts in front of adults. Apparently, the writers thought this was hilarious to have a teenage girl speak like that. The movie seemed like it was 3 hours long. It dragged on and on and would not end. It was boring and tedious.I hope that the teenage girl's career isn't ruined by this film. She really impressed. Otherwise, save your precious time and do not waste it on this terrible movie."
" Pleasantly Surprised
",0.6124,0.769,2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"I had NO idea Gosling was sooo funny!! I had wanted to see The Nice Guys in theaters sadly never got around to it. Which was unfortunate bc I would've been more than glad to pay for this (matinee of course lol). The only negatives I have would be the daughter; I understand she was supposed to be beyond her years but she was slightly annoying and the connection btwn Amelia & Misty still slightly confused me but I'll let it slide. Reading the ""what was the funniest part"" message boards up here, how could anyone forget the bowling ball flying thru the air or the part in the beginning with the widow searchin for missing husband (take a look on the mantle!) Hilarious!!!! I really enjoyed this film bc it was a combo of action, hilarity, and a little blood. Whenever it comes on HBO I'll definitely watch... Ooh it's on rite now, gotta go!"
" Bad acting, unlikable characters
",-0.5423,-0.3934,2017-01-29 00:00:00,2,"Nothing else was on, so I gave this movie a shot. Ryan Gosling's character purports to love his daughter, but is a complete screw up of a drunk father, barely coherent, stumbling through life and death situations and making it out by dumb luck. Russell Crowe's character is somewhat better, but is the stereotype of tough guy with a soft spot for the kid. The two of them, especially Crowe, commit violence that should land them in prison for life, but face no consequences. Barely even a 'don't do that' from police. There's big corruption supposedly being done, that will be revealed in a supposed porn film. Truthfully, the kid Holly is the best thing in the film, and even that is a stereotype -- smart kid who does everything she's told not to and saves all the adults... Billed as hysterically funny, I found it just incredibly stupid, nothing but bad writing and bad acting."
" What a pile of GARBAGE!
",0.0,0.9173,2017-01-28 00:00:00,1,"How in the hell this got a rating above 7 on IMDb is beyond me and I'll never trust this site again. There is nothing redeeming about this piece of crap movie. Tried to be funny and cute and it's not. What little plot is ridiculous and dumb, gratuitous nudity, swearing etc.... Russel Crowe is fat and bloated and Gosling is a tiny bit better but nothing can save this waste of time. Do yourself a favor and skip this joke. An obvious rip off / knock off of Lethal Wespon films and can't even come close. Buddy films can be fun but this one isn't. Disappointing to sit down with friends and after taking all kinds of time we select this movie. Kept hoping it would get better but never did. People walking out of the room early. Awful. An example of why Hollywood just makes garbage (mostly) now. Total Garbage!!!!!"
" Not so nice
",-0.3713,0.9089,2017-01-25 00:00:00,9,"But very good if you are into this kind of stuff. So this is not Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or Last Boy Scout, but it is a new movie by Shane Black, which is a reason to get excited about. If you like weird dialog and situations comedy that he seems to be able to write spot on, then you are in the right place.Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling hit the nails on their heads. Deadpan or outright funny, completely insane to just weird. One thing this is not: Predictable or tame. You only have to decide if this is your kind of movie. If your taste and the movies do either collide or are in the same ballpark. If the latter is the case, do watch it and you'll get something unique and really good. One of the Highlights of 2016 for sure"
" Watch it with an open mind and smiles are guaranteed
",0.4767,0.9485,2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"I've seen reviews of this that say ""poor depiction of the 70's"", ""the daughter ruined the whole thing"", ""the characters are poorly shaped"" - all valid if you're eager to see this movie as a failure even before you've watched the first five minutes.What I saw was one of the funniest cop/detective comedies since The Other Guys, starring a duo with just as much potential as Chan and Tucker in Rush Hour.After recent memory was soiled with all sorts of awful Kevin Hart/The Rock combos, The Nice Guys was a breath of fresh air. Crowe and Gosling were solid and clearly enjoyed the whole thing, and while the script may have been found lacking at times, it was the humor (and arguably Gosling's overacting) that saved the day every single time. Those of you watching this in the States, I beg you: if you've lived through the 70's, watch this without judging the setting too much. It wasn't meant as an accurate biopic, and looking for flaws will just ruin your experience.Look out for some old school references and be prepared for a whole lot of random humor. As stated above, I would see this morphing into a trilogy, similar to Rush Hour. All it needs is the right follow-up and a script that keeps playing on Crowe's and Gosling's abilities. 8/10 - would definitely watch again, easily a solid addition to the weekend movie shelf."
" Disco Detectives
",0.0,0.9532,2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Plot; In 1977 Los Angels, a scuffling private eye and a low level enforcer get caught up in a case that will take them from high dollar world of automobiles to the gutters of the burgeoning adult film business.Take the buddy cop genre and smash it together with Boogie Nights and you have Shane Black's The Nice Guys, a critical hit and subsequent commercial failure that deserved a better fate. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe have great chemistry as two mismatched guys in over their heads. With laughs aplenty and a legitimately interesting mystery to boot, I hope more people give this worthy, quirky little comedy a chance on home video."
