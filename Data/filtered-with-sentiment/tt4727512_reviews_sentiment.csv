",0.0,0.9985,2019-05-26 00:00:00,8,"Its is not an easy thing after an epic and super successful movie Bahubali also last two of Mahesh Babu movies were an average and labeled as flop moves (though I do not agree that 1 Nenokkadine was a bad move). Therefore, the the odds were not that great. But here is what, Srimanthudu surpassed my expectations, richness is everywhere, cinematography, story, screen play, direction, music (could have been even better), and my favorite one, the fight scenes. Director Koritalla Siva is known for best from his previous move Mirchi, took almost three years to make his second movie and done an excellent job.Recently it is quite common that the hero is a born rich and parents wanted to continue the family saga, however, director took in a different direction, after all rich people also starve to do something better to the society, this is exactly what this movie is about. A simple message to adopt a village.Mahesh looked awesome (as usual), he has done an excellent job, and lived in his character, one noticeable thing that director was very careful is in Mahesh dances, did not put lot of effort in there (dances are not Mahesh department). A great deal of credit goes to hero characterization, we can feel that, this role only Mahesh can do. We all know that we may hit two or three people but definitely not 10s and 20s, however, framing of fight scenes are exceptionally good and Mahesh done excellent job in that. Not much to say about Shruti Hassan, she got a decent role and done reasonably well, she looks very skinny, I think she should seriously think about put on some weight.My second favorite role in this movie is Jagapati Babu, he is well suited in his father's role, did not miss Prakash Raju at all, Jagapti Babu has a great future in his second inning as a character role.Before I conclude, many of us came from village background, I am sure this will take us to our childhood and will remind us our village days, definitely creates some thoughts on visiting our birth place.Music department is average, just couple of songs were good, rest can be taken out and more over this movie does not require any song (may be two if someone is desperate). No usual comedy track which is a big relief.Overall, it is well a made movie, keeps you interesting till end and best treat for Mahesh Babu fans."

" Touching family drama With a message
",0.0,0.9994,2018-06-29 00:00:00,10,"Films that promote altruism are as rare as rare-earth metals these days. By that count and the vibrancy of the title itself (which means a Billionaire in Telugu), ""Srimanthudu"" is an exceptionally well-made film that will go into Mahesh Babu's catalogue of best films after ""Athadu"" and ""Dookudu"". Koratala Siva, the writer-turned director who earlier made the warmth-exuding ""Mirchi"" returns with a squeaky-clean film that shines in almost all departments except elements of entertainment and comedy. In selecting a movie of this genre, both Mahesh Babu and the makers should be congratulated because it takes gut-level audacity to endorse a script like this which revolves around a hero forsaking his billions and family business empire to adopt a village that roots his origins.The story goes like this. (Harsha) Mahesh is the swashbuckling son of the 25000 crore business magnate JagapathiBabu who moves in Rolls Royce cars and strikes business deals at board meetings or golf courses. Father Jagapathi Babu and mother Sukanya and the family dote on him but Mahesh is lost in his thoughts of being a do-gooder who loves tending to the care of his corporate group employees' events and festivities, even going out of way to help them out in settling their daughters' marriage etc. He is shaping up to do something different, anything other than inheriting the Infrastructure empire his father built. Enter Shruti Hassan who casts a spell on Mahesh with her simplicity and good-heartedness. Both develop a liking for each other and fall in love but the turning point comes when Shruti reads a business magazine coverage of Mahesh and his father's business interests and finds out they hail from the same village Devarakota that she belongs to - where her father Rajendra Prasad lives. In the romance that builds up, there is a parallel narrative of the troubles spewing out of the village ruled by Sampath and gang who runs a distillery but doesn't care that people are running away from village because of unirrigated lands, and ill-maintained schools. To top it, he is acting in cohort with his brother Mukesh Rishi, who is a Union Minister, to grab over 6000 acres of land for a lucrative coastal corridor project. Sampath's menacing villainy ensures that more and more villagers flee the village, many are slain and those that remain (about 520 families) live in constant threat of fear of death.Siva Koratala has shades of a Trivikram who knows his lines well but also feels a responsibility for going home with just one or two messages without dilution and ambiguity. Director Siva makes the film intense and neat with most of the characters playing their parts well without hype.The turning point of the film comes when Mahesh enters the village and ""adapts"" it as his home, right outside Rajendra Prasad's house and tames the villains and the herds who are hurting the village. The ending of course is a happy one but the narration of 163 minutes that goes into this simple tale is something unparalleled in Telugu films used to propping up of un necessary comedy tracks, deviant side-tracks and dozens of side-villains, mindless violence and unnecessary stunts, besides reckless dialogues that reek of double-meanings and vulgarities.Koratala Siva has used the medium of cinema to incorporate the elements of a story that he believed will resonate with most people who are leading urbanized lives disconnected with the plight of conditions which motivated them to chase affluence in the first place. There is a laser-sharp clarity of script and the storyline never deviates from the beginning, building up the characterization of Mahesh with a layered-approach. It starts slow in the first half, establishing the context of the environment in which Mahesh grows and then goes into the subtext of the world that is about to disrupt his fluid state of thinking. It reminds you of some of the films like ""Swades"" and ""Athadu"" in some scenes but broadly, the narrative is quite original and non-flashy, that is what makes the film a visual treat to watch with exceptional cinematography by Madhie -who makes the scale of the film bigger and colourful than what it normally appears. Instead of using props of star comedians and bazooka dialogues, director Siva has subjugated the entire script and screenplay to the weight of the story that has just one flashback in the second half. Packing plenty of substance in his heart-tugging dialogues, Siva generates a reel-by-reel buildup in the appreciation one develops for Mahesh's character of Harsha before it reaches one high point before interval and then takes it to another level after interval.
Director Siva has shades of a Trivikram who knows his lines well but also feels a responsibility for going home with just one or two messages without dilution and ambiguity. Because of that obsession, some elements of mass appeal were given a big miss but they should not matter in the overall reception of the film. Family audiences have a lot riding on it - there are at least five or six emotionally-surcharged scenes which moisten your eyes and the underlying theme of going back to one's village more than once a year for a Sankranti is dealt with lot of impact and intensity. The film highlights the real reasons for villages abegging for attention and not just a closet-cupboard for hoarding all the development funds - there is a good lineation of how funds are siphoned off, how irrigation is neglected, why schools which are supposed to be building blocks are in perennial shambles, and how apathy that begins with ambition eats into the inside of a village in the name of urbanization. Director Siva has made a good study of issues that are even highlighted in landmark books written by P Sainath (""Why Everybody loves a good drought"") and gave a credible perspective through this story on what can get the villages back up as lively hubs of habitation and prosperity. What he misses though is an opportunity to get some of the shinier aspects of village life which are seen in full glory around festival time in picture frames; most shots are distressing and depressing, but that may not be happening everywhere. Also, by showing the entire village as living under the grip of hooligans, director may have over-simplified the concept of lawless villages - there may be many such villages in India in a country which has 650 districts and numerous villages but a better approach would have been to institutionalize them. For instance, Mahesh's company itself is a shown as a successful bidder for Highways and other infra projects. Nothing would have stopped him from enrolling his own company's paraphernalia into the overlaying of the rural amenities that are absent in his native village.But the heroism is essential to elevate the character of Mahesh and make a point on making a difference to the ecosystem that made your world once. Director Siva makes the film intense and neat with most of the characters playing their parts well without hype.
 Mahesh Babu, undoubtedly is the star of the film. He carries all the weight on his shoulders and outshines everybody with his minimalistic acting and dancing. His dialogues also stand out - and fans will love his powerful punches.
result, one gets an empty feeling watching them perform.Mahesh Babu, undoubtedly is the star of the film. He carries all the weight on his shoulders and outshines everybody with his minimalistic acting and dancing. After a long time, he gets a role where his body-language syncs with the character of a Richie-rich boy who serenedes a glam girl and does good action and emotional drama on-screen. His dancing skills are not so well-known as those of his contemporaries but he manages to uplift himself with some groovy moves that look gorgeous on-screen, thanks to some exceptional attires - dapper suits, gentleman hats and all that. His dialogues also stand out - and fans will love that he has more punchfuls in store than what the trailer unleashed. The scenes where he packs a punch are the scenes with his father and mother where he asks them to leave him alone for just this one life, another scene with Rajendra Prasad and his brother Edida Sriram when the latter wants to leave for the city, and at least two confrontation scenes with Sampath. The songs have already become popular thanks to excellent music by DSP and lyrics by Ramsjogayya Sastry and each song is picturised in stylish costumes and good settings. The background song of ""Srimanthudaa"" is a real scorcher on-screen that repeats in tandem atleast thrice, once in slow tempo. All other songs look colourful and grand on-screen. The only inconsistency slipped in with Mahesh is that there are at least two occasions when Mahesh is shown flipping through magazines which are inconsistent with his characterisation - once, he flips through ""Astroview"", another time this altruistic and charity-minded businessman's son leafs through ""Outlook Money"" magazine - both are unnecessary. Of course, the occasion that he distracts himself at a board meeting with a video game is just apt. Director Siva has used the body language of Mahesh to perfection - one or two stunts are refreshing.On the whole, ""Srimanthudu"" would have been near perfect had it been edited for 25 minutes or so. That is one of the things that subtracts a good rating from the movie - because viewers have short attention spans and may not relish 163 minute duration. The first half also appears slow compared with the power-packed second half. But director Siva has given us a credible and emotionally worked up tale with all the sincerity and clarity that will go down as one of the most-respected films of our time - with top-notch production values and commendable performances by almost everybody. (Yes, even Jagapathi Babu redeems himself with the sole flashback sequence). We need a mean reversion like ""Srimanthudu"" once in a while to get back to the basics of what we can take from and give ba"
" Mahesh Strikes Back
",-0.3612,0.9995,2018-06-29 00:00:00,10,"Mahesh Babu, one of the biggest superstars in South India, has come up with his latest movie, Srimanthudu. Despite his recent movies not performing well at the ticket counter, this movie carries huge expectations as the trailers and songs have become popular. Does it live up to expectations? Let's find out.Story:
RK (Jagapathi Babu) owns a business empire. He wants his son Harsha (Mahesh Babu) to take over the operations but Harsha has other plans - serving people.Harsha likes Charusheela (Shruti), a post graduate student studying Rural Development, and joins her college to study the course. Both fall in love. But when Charusheela comes to know that Harsha is son of RK, she stops seeing him.Harsha asks her for the reason, she tells him about her Devarakota, a small village in Uttarandhra. The village's tank is grabbed by local rowdy Sasi (Sampath) who is the right hand man of central minister Venkata Ratnam (Mukeshi Rishi).The villagers start migrating to the cities but Charusheela's father tries to stop them in the hope that good-days would come soon.What has this plight of the village got to do with Harsha's father and what does Harsha do when Charusheela tells him this? Watch it on the silver screen.Artistes' Performances:
The film is undoubtedly one of Mahesh Babu's best performance in his entire career. As well-educated, good-natured rich man, Mahesh Babu oozes charm as well as gives his best in the emotionally charged scenes. Even in the action episodes, he exhibits class. Mahesh Babu is the pillar of this movie.Shruti Haasan looks beautiful, shares great chemistry with Mahesh and has solid role too. Jagapathi Babu is evolving as a reliable character artiste for dignified father roles. He is perfect to the T as a rich businessman. Rajendra Prasad is good as well.Sampath and Mukesh Rishi have done what is required for the roles. Sukanya, Ali, Rahul Ravindran, Subbaraju, Vennela Kishore, Sitara and a host of actors are present in the movie but they don't get highlighted.Technical Excellence:
Rich frames are the striking feature of the movie. Appreciation should go to the cinematographer Madhie. He has distinct style in filming hero elevating scenes.Songs by Devi Sri Prasad are catchy. 'Rama Rama', 'Charusheela' and 'Jaago Re' songs are effective on screen.The pace of the movie is not only slow but some unnecessary scenes are also there, good editing would have done wonders. Fights by ANL Arasu are neat.Highlights:Mahesh Babu's performance

Analysis:
Director Siva Koratala has proven that he could present regular mass movies in style with 'Mirchi'. In Srimanthudu, he has used the same style but has strong content and has narrated the movie in focused manner, not deviating from the story.While watching the movie, you will also spot the similarities with Mirchi like father's love for son (Jagapathi Babu/Sathyaraj), hero entering into a village on a certain mission.Also, Koratala selected a topic that rings well with the current mood in the nation - adopting the villages. One can also find influence of Ashutosh Gowariker's 'Swades'.No special intro is given to Mahesh Babu. He comes into the story with a song and then the story is told in leisurely.In the first one hour, it goes on sluggish pace but picks up later. Even in the first hour some scenes like Mahesh Babu confronting Mukesh Rishi at his residence in Delhi, fight sequence in wedding get highlighted. Second half the movie takes a gripping turn.""You have earned respect through sheer hardwork, let me also earn it,"" tells Mahesh Babu to his father Jagapathi Babu in one scene. Such class scenes laced with dialogues and liberal dose of English are welcome change.Then there is also one gripping sequence in the second half when Mukeshi Rishi invites the hero to his mango farm. The movie is dotted with many scenes that elevate heroism to the peak.Dialogues written by the director will also make the fans happy. When Mahesh beats a rowdy, another one comes forward to beat him, then Mahesh tells to this guy: ""Nenu Ikkade Untanu..repu kooda untanu..vaade kadatledu..mundu vaani choodandi."" Mahesh taking selfie with a rowdy is another hilarious moment in the film.Mahesh Babu's class performance, Shruti's charm, good message, right mix of mass and class elements make the movie a good commercial entertainer.All in all, Srimanthudu is the movie where content and commercial elements have blended well. Bottomline: Srimanthudu With Rich Message"
" Back to the roots
",0.0,0.999,2018-06-29 00:00:00,10,"If a leading star has had two box office turkeys, one would expect his next film to have all that's considered necessary for a blockbuster. While trying to get this recipe for success right, often, a director plays around with an apology of a plot.The trailer of Srimanthudu had the glimpse of a promising story line, of a well-heeled youngster adopting a village. But the promotional campaign laid stress on the entertainment factor; the team didn't want to make the huge fan base believe they are in for a 'message-oriented' drama. Does the promise of a strong core get drowned in the masala? Pleasantly, it doesn't. Director Koratala Siva gives the fan base enough to cheer and at the same time, has a firm grip over the plot.Harsha (Mahesh) is the scion of his father's (Jagapati Babu) business empire. He isn't keen on taking over the reigns of the empire. Rather, he takes up a course on rural development after he meets Charusheela (Shruti Haasan), who wants to use technology to the benefit of her village.Harsha doles out wads of notes to an elderly woman begging at the traffic signal, donates lakhs of rupees to an employee for his daughter's wedding and generally, remains aloof from the ostentatious setting that surrounds him. Like the father and son in K. Balachander's excellent Rudraveena, here too, the father and son differ in their ideological outlook. The father-son clashes here are more subtle. There is a certain respect with which Harsha puts forth his points of view and bides time to, like he says, earn his respect.Giving away money is the first step, but will Harsha risk his life when he is up against a local hoodlum, Sashi (Sampath) and a minister (Mukesh Rishi)? A liquor network, a water bottling unit eating into the drinking water source of the village, and agriculture land at the brink of being taken over for political gains, all find a place in Harsha's journey.As the hurdles get tougher, the film glorifies Harsha as the hamlet's saviour. But that's expected of a commercial entertainer.There are nice little touches in the narrative, like the small-time vendor keeping a count of the families remaining in the village as many leave to the city for better prospects. Then, there's the portion where Rajendra Prasad (the do-gooder witnessing the slow decay of his village over the years and is yet optimistic of future) is unable to say anything when his own brother's family wants to leave.The stylishly mounted dance numbers punctuate the proceedings, along with laughter in the form of Vennela Kishore. Srimanthudu has a huge supporting cast, with most of them not having anything substantial to do. Sukanya as the doting mother, the spiritually-inclined Subbaraju, Rahul Ravindran as the cousin, Thulasi as the woman frustrated with the village, and Tejaswi Madiwada in a guest appearance... the list is long.A couple of songs stand out in Devi Sri Prasad's music. The cinematography and technical finesse are an asset.Shruti Haasan seems to be getting better with each film and does her part with grace and earnestness, managing to hold her own in a film that worships the hero. Mahesh carries the film on his shoulders, working his charm throughout. And yeah, as with some of his previous films, there are enough references made to his good looks. Beyond looking stylish, the actor comes up with an understated, mature performance.This isn't Ashutosh Gowariker's Swades, where Shah Rukh Khan finds his true calling in a much more realistic manner. The social consciousness comes coated with commercially viable ingredients and still, makes for an engaging watch.SrimanthuduCast: Mahesh, Shruti Haasan, Jagapati BabuDirection: Koratala SivaMusic: Devi Sri PrasadStory line: A rich guy wants to give back to society but has to face stumbling blocks.Bottom line: A star-driven film with a strong plot that's worth a watch."
