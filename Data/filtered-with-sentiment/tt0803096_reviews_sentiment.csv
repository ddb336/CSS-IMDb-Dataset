One of the best fantasy stories.I'm sure that Hollywood affraid of game industry and Blizzard.There's some kind of sabotage story behind marketing of this movie."

" A forgettable fantasy movie clearly targeted to make money

But it doesn't stand out in any particular way. For what it's worth it's a forgettable fantasy movie with some cool special effects and CGI and that's it."
" Pretty Good

" This could be as big as Star Wars if they kept working at it.
",-0.5574,0.9521,2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,"This is a great first movie, there is so much story to tell, so many great characters to show, this should have been followed up by two more movies right away, but now time is moving away.What made Star Wars blow up was the characters and you have them in this movie, but we need to see more of them to really get a good connection and move forward, that's why two more movies are needed.
You need to introduce other characters from the lore as well, and keep pushing out content. I truly believe this could be as big as Star Wars if they had worked it, but the investment effort behind things these days is so little unless they see a reward right away.Maybe this movie didn't sell as well as they hoped, but other movies could have made up for it. It's all about timing, and holding onto an audience once you have them hooked. I really want to see more of this story, more Warcraft movies."
" ""Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs of War!""
",-0.8217,0.9945,2021-02-18 00:00:00,5,"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Even after the first ten minutes I was trying to find issues with it, because I just had it in my mind that it was going to be terrible, but I found that I was struggling.Before I continue I should probably say that I have never played even five minutes on the Game that this film is based on, so I am looking at it purely from the view of a film fan.Despite it being a good watch and for the most part, very enjoyable, I did think that there was a pace issue and I could have done with a bit more of a back story for the Orcs and maybe more of a set up in general. I don't understand why there was such an issue for pace, because the geeks that follow these things, myself included, would quite happily sit and watch it for 3 hours, so why make it just over 2?
It also needed a bit of sex and a little bit of down time to show what they were all fighting for - Why did the Orc's think they could just take the land and need it at all and what was the human side of the gate like before the war was brought?, But it really wasn't a bad storyline at all.
I can understand that the original idea was made for an XBox and not a cinema screen and that as a result there are bound to be similarities to things like 'Lord Of The Rings', Thor and even Harry Potter (Hippogriffs/Giant Birds/Orcs), but some of the settings seemed to have been lifted straight from other films. At one point I thought that Khadgar was in Boss Nass' Council Chamber (Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace).
There were other issues with the CGI as well, the Orc men seemed alright, but Gul'dan and the women were definitely distorted in an obviously computer generated way.The story is good though. It's a new take on this genre and I generally liked it. Would I say that it's as good as The Tolkien films? No, but it's pretty close to 'The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies'.As for the actors- I don't know who cast Dominic Cooper, but they were just so wrong to do so. He just doesn't have the presence to be the King.Lothar played by Travis Fimmel however was very good and I believed in his character.
Khadgar was also very good, played by Ben Schnetzer, he provided a sort of view from an audience perspective, before becoming integral to the plot. I wasn't sure about him at first, but he seemed to fit right in after a short while.
The other Ben (Foster) who starred as Medivh was another that I thought would be terrible, but surprised me. I haven't liked some of his other work, but he did this quite well. Maybe he should stick to fantasy, although I didn't like him as Angel in 'X-Men: The Last Stand'.
There were also some other good actors in there, but they played Orcs which seemed a bit of a waste of their talents actually. Either Clancy Brown or Robert Kazinsky would have been better to play The King, although Clancy does have a good voice to be an Orc.I'm not sure that the studio believed in this one as the stars seem to be slightly B-list, but they all seem to do their jobs well.I would certainly like to see a sequel, but with the few issues ironed out."
" To be continued?!
",0.0,0.938,2021-02-16 00:00:00,4,"I went into this with low expectations but watched it anyway because I used to play the original Warcraft and I was curious. I found myself liking it enough: some good main characters on both sides, and interesting plot. It got me rooting for two main characters especially but then one of them was killed off. Around that time I started getting frustrated with the story. Scenes drag out hoping to increase tension or anticipation but made me impatient instead and ultimately unsatisfied. The way the movie ends is especially frustrating...I don't want to give any spoilers but I do want to warn viewers that this has a complete ""to be continued"" ending, like The Fellowship of the Ring. But in The Fellowship you know there are two more parts and the books are very well known. Where is part two of Warcraft? Did they make this assuming they would make another or was it aimed at just superfans of Warcraft? They could have made a more satisfying ending while still leaving the viewer wanting more, like countless other movies."
" This is why games do not make good movies.
",-0.3412,-0.9219,2021-02-06 00:00:00,2,"An overuse of special effects cannot carry this films woeful plot and script. Big money can't replace talent in the script writing and development of the story. Despite the craftsmanship if the CG specialists, many scenes are ruined by the poor art direction, with a cacophony of noisy and jarring colours of blue and green. Even die hard fans will be sorely disappointed at what is no less an abomination of the franchise. So, as the plot and script are beyond redemption, I'll describe the visual elements. The style and scenery is overtly influenced by the Chinese production companies involved. Although many technical talents have been employed, the art direction is immature and game-like. CG characters appear to be designed by game developers not cinematic specialists. The scenery lacks depth in representing its origin from Blizzard. Even Blizzards internal art teams produced higher quality unique cut scenes in the game, than any scene in this 90 minute travesty. I had wanted to see this movie succeed and do well, but the immature and narrow artistic view of the Chinese production companies involved has failed to carry the magic from our computers to the big screen."

" Fantastic special effects can't help the poor pacing and plot
",0.7647,0.955,2021-01-11 00:00:00,5,"""Warcraft"" looks incredible. From the time the movie opens all the way to the moment the credits roll, I sat on my couch stunned at how fantastic everything looked - the special effects were visually stunning, the battle sequences epic in scope and brutal in their consequences, the settings and set design jaw-droppingly gorgeous, and the orcs as lifelike as any CGI orc could be. From a visual standpoint, ""Warcraft"" is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, when it comes to pacing and plotting, the movie starts to show its weaknesses.This is a film that would've greatly benefited from a longer running time. I have no doubt that the less than exciting plot and poor pacing were caused by studio executives meddling in the filmmaking process. That said, we have to judge a film based on the finished product, and the finished product is a plodding and boring movie. ""Warcraft"" starts, thankfully, from the perspective of the orcs. The incredible special effects alone is enough to draw one in; once the movie pivots and starts showing the humans, the pacing slows to a crawl. Practically every sequence regarding the human characters is one of exposition. People walk and talk, sit and talk, maybe run and talk, and rinse and repeat. Plot points are explained to the audience, as are specific backgrounds of certain characters, meaning that ""Warcraft"" does a lot of telling, and not enough showing. The scenes with the orcs are slightly better, but they also follow the same formula as the human sequences. The orcs too go through the motions of standing around and talking to each other - the only difference is these scenes are slightly more entertaining because of the great visual effects.When the orcs and humans finally start to collaborate the movie does pick up a bit, leading to some cool battle set pieces. Even though the movie is PG-13, the violence doesn't feel too neutered. Humans are crushed with larger than life hammers, and orcs are dismembered and decapitated, with green blood splashing onto the screen. The action is entertaining, and a true spectacle, but there's not nearly enough of it to make up for how slow this movie is. There are maybe two small action scenes before the final battle at the end; in between, you'll find scene after scene of people going from one location to the other and talking to more people. Thematically, it doesn't work, and it leads to a mostly boring film.The climax picks up, featuring many stunning battles and intriguing character moments. Unfortunately, many of the most interesting elements are moments that set up a sequel that we will never get. I wish this movie would've done better in the box office, because I did enjoy the worldbuilding and the characters enough to want to see a sequel. However, as its own movie, ""Warcraft"" is disappointing. It's not exciting enough to be a good action film, not interesting enough to be a character study, and not paced well enough to work as a standalone story. In the end, it does leave you wanting more, but perhaps not in the way the filmmakers wanted."

" Entertaining enough
",0.4404,0.9365,2020-11-16 00:00:00,7,"I was surprised to learn that this movie was panned by critics upon its release and that it bombed in the box office, I thought this is a pretty decent movie. It has a good entertainment value, the CGI was actually excellent and you could rank it as same league with most high-budgeted superhero movies. The performances were good tho some could be better. The storyline's all over the place at times but it's not hard to follow and the score is fitting. It even set up a sequel which I doubt will ever happen due to this movie's performance, but you never know what the future has in store.As far video game adaptation goes, this was definitely better than many others out there."
" Romper Room
",0.0,-0.0296,2020-11-11 00:00:00,4,"I made it half way through this movie and totally lost interest. Dozed off until a battle scene woke me up with the obnoxious volume. The dialogue seemed stiff and ingenuine. Characters are flat and two dimensional and the actors are too young to be taken seriously. I'm surprised some of the male actors were able to grow facial hair. Well, maybe it's just glued onto their faces.. Aside from the occasional hairy or feathered fantasy creature (I like those) this movie was one big yawwwwn for me."
" This review is biased
",-0.2732,0.9792,2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,"I am a World of Warcraft fan, so this review is likely biased (and late). I understand reviews stating the film could have been visually better and I agree. Still, for a first go round I loved it, especially the nice character intros. Acting was excellent and the storyline fit in very well with the games. I will say that the characterization of the night elves was just...no. Should have gone with CGI to avoid cosplay visuals. I am hoping, maybe foolishly, for a sequel. Ideally, I'd love to see a series. Come on Netflix (Hulu, Amazon, etc.), there's a gold mine here."
" Blizzard Universe
",0.0,0.4069,2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,I think Blizzard are wasting so much movie material. Diabolo and Warcraft are more than DC and Marvel. If Blizzard is reading this - please make more movies.

After watching it, I was felt like ""What?, Why did they tell this as trash? This is really good and really promising to build a universe."" Like I described, Yes!!!. This movie totally worth a sequel and could be the start of a universe like Ironman is the beginning of Marvel Universe. And one thing I don't understand is the production for this movie stopped for Sequels. Are they insane? Did they throw away the good movie like trash? OMG!!"
" Fantastic movie
",0.5574,0.9731,2020-09-29 00:00:00,9,"It was a great movie. However, I would have liked a different storyline, particularly I would have liked Lich King to be involved. It's a great story, which The beginning also was but I think the story of the GREAT LICH KING would be better. I hope there will be a 2nd movie, because the Warcraft World have a lot to offer."
" Entertaining
",0.4404,0.9831,2020-09-23 00:00:00,8,"Warcraft was an entertaining fantasy movie. The visuals were good, acting could have been better, the action scenes were good but had more potential. Pacing was not good; the beginning is fast but after that film slows down.Even after having run time of 2 hours, the movie feels a bit short. You could easily add 20 minutes without the audience feeling bored.I do not agree with critic's review. It is worth watching in cinemas. You will most likely have a good time. It's no masterpiece, but it's an entertaining blockbuster."

How did I not know this movie existed, I'm highly disappointed in my friends loll someone should of told me. Honestly great flick and amazing animations. I just wish I saw it sooner along with many who probably feel the same so we could of gotten a sequel. If the actors see this, BRAVO!"
" Dull nonsense and mumbo-jumbo for non-fans
",-0.6597,-0.9306,2020-09-09 00:00:00,3,"Having never played a minute of Warcraft, I didn't have much hope that this movie would entertain me, and somehow it managed to live down to those low expectations. For starters, the CGI is not great. Everything other than the humans looks like a video game, so I'm not sure what this movie was adding for the fans. As with any movie based on a video game, I have to imagine it would be more fun to actively play these adventures than just watching them in bad CGI. It's not the worst animation I've ever seen, but it needed more practical elements for me to believe the humans were interacting with something real. Then there's the overload of ridiculous names for all these characters. It feels like so much of this movie is made up of people just talking about other people, and I could not track who was who because all their names sounded like gobbledygook.The plot is highly predictable, and that made it overly boring for me. There are a few reveals that people are infected with this evil magic, and it's the most obvious people imaginable. I also struggled a bit with the use of green to indicate someone was connected to the dark magic, because it wasn't used consistently. Then there's the horrible cast. Even actors that I typically enjoy were disappointing in Warcraft, and some of the lead roles are granted to no-name people that will probably remain no-names if this is the best they can do. I didn't manage to even be slightly interested in the story of Warcraft, partially because all the characters were dull or despicable. It's one of those movies where I started to zone out during the action sequences. I've certainly seen worse fantasy adventure films, but Warcraft is still low on the list."
" Disappointed Fan
",-0.2023,0.9307,2020-08-10 00:00:00,4,"I played and loved the very first WarCraft game and am a big fan of Travis Fimmel and Ben Foster. I appreciate that a lot of money was spent on the special effects. But this is a cheesy two hour digital cartoon video game trailer for children, not a serious movie. Bad script, dialogue, undeveloped characters, hollow performances, rushed editing. A waste of excellent acting talent. The dwarves and elves looked silly. Felt like almost the entire movie was CGI or green screen. The orcs are just too fake to take seriously, resulting in a pompous, clumsy, gigantic piece of fool's gold."

I cannot imagine how better they could portray that disgustingly colorful the world.
Pity they had to cut the movie to reduce the screen time and never released a directors cut. Thus it may be a bit difficult for a casual viewer to follow the plot and understand certain character motivations (Medivh) without knowing the source material.
Potential directors cut could fix most of it and shift the score undoubtly to 10/10.
Yet the film suffers basically because of limiting the directors vision.

" Over-ambitious and flawed
",0.0,0.9441,2020-04-18 00:00:00,5,"Orcs and humans try to find common ground, both on and off the battlefield, in this sweeping, large-scale attempt to bring Blizzard's best-selling video game to the big screen. The thing I appreciate most about this effort is its even-handedness. Unlike Lord of the Rings before it, there's an admirable amount of grey-shading on each side of the struggle and a very small number of either irredeemable or infallible characters. The menacing orcs, towering and tusk-mouthed, worry about their children and maintain honorable traditions within their own ranks. Their human counterparts show trepidation and uncertainty, nearly coming to blows as they debate their defense strategy behind closed doors. This makes the simmering war feel more two-sided and honest; no faceless horde of pitch-black bad guys here. Unfortunately, that meditative tone never allows the plot to gain much steam amidst so much pontification. It's overstuffed with characters, bearing complicated names that might be familiar to fans but only blur together for the uninitiated. There's probably enough room for three or four really good character arcs, but instead the narration hops around to cover more than a dozen. The acting is stiff and wooden, whether provided by flesh-and-blood humans or fully-CG orcs, which probably has a lot to do with the abundance of stilted dialog. In a lot of ways, it feels like the first disc of a Playstation-era RPG. A whole lot of setup and world-building, a few mini-bosses and a surprise death or three; maybe a good teaser to keep us on the hook for the next chapter, but only the earliest hint of a resolution. Over-ambitious and flawed, it's an effective CG showpiece but far too slow, wordy and self-important for its own good."

",0.0,-0.9185,2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Listen, this isn't going to be ""Lord of the Rings."" It does have some similarities, but overall, it feels like its own thing. Keep in mind that prior to viewing this movie, I knew absolutely nothing about the World of Warcraft, so I can't say how true it is to the source material. But judging it on its own merit, I found it surprisingly entertaining. The battle sequences are huge (although one problem is they do tend to drag on a bit too long), the plot was surprisingly thought-provoking, and the scenery and the CGI are just so beautifully done. The Orcs have so much detail put into them, that for the most part the line between real and CGI is blurred. (However, this is just when the Orcs are in scenes by themselves. When they're with human characters, the CGI tends to look a bit faker.) There are some elements that are very obviously ""borrowed"" from Tolkien's work, but overall I thought it was a fun movie. It does have some of the cliches that are in every fantasy movie, but they're few. The battle sequences are just brutal! The death toll and the emotion in the battles really make you feel for the characters, whether they be human or Orc. There are heroes and villains on both sides of the conflict. and it doesn't matter which side you root for, because without giving anything away, I will say the film doesn't really have a resolution to the conflict, which left me feeling empty. I know they did this because they think it's going to be a trilogy (or more), but sadly I doubt this will get one. That's something I thought I'd never say. I want this story to continue. I want to see more of these characters and world. I won't play any of the games because on the 0.000001% chance this does end up getting a series of films, I want to judge them on their own merit, just as I did this one. It's only fair.

Although it is sad that they did not introduce elfs and dwarfs too much it is actually a good thing... it would be hard to put more character development in it and that was what other reviewers where complaining about; they actually shouldn't because it would have destroyed this movie... it is better to introduce them in a new movie if it ever comes."

It's a good movie, it's a great movie for warcraft fans, but not so good for the general audience, it will take effort to invest in."

" An insult to old fans
",-0.5106,-0.947,2019-11-16 00:00:00,4,"I cannot like a movie which makes a complete mess out of the official history of Warcraft. I can only compare Blizzard Entertainment's lack of interest with the idea of Peter Jackson refusing to film The Two Towers and skipping from the first movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy to the third. (To avoid any uncertainties, the Warcraft movie presents the events of the first Warcraft game.) The movie's ending however makes half of the history in the second Warcraft game improbable.
On to the second most frustrating detail. The main antagonist is a tyrant, what would make for a good drama, if only the official story did not present him merely as a schemer. This behavior is forced upon the story, leading to events that were also unimaginable in the official lore, but with no lasting impact. So the movie concentrates on presenting these and the origins of the Dark Portal instead of the actual war. In fact in official history none of the battles from the movie have happened.
The only explanation I can muster for this is that the movie is oriented towards the age group playing World of Warcraft and Blizzard Entertainment considered the original history of Warcraft I to be too tragic for that audience. People who haven't played WoW received flashes of possibly familiar content from the franchise such as brutish orcs and soldiers of Stormwind to get them excited about the game and the rest of the audience, who may have actually grown up on this story may go and hang themselves.
I'm not one to frequently spot poor acting or poor CGI, so except the fact that Lothar looks nothing like his game version, I don't have an opinion on those. The movie gives me a glimmer of hope, that Blizzard will one day realize, that warriors want to be able to see their surroundings, so will not wear shoulder pads that obstruct their vision, but Blackhand's armor-decorations thus far elude logic.
I consider the soundtrack to be about average. I've seen many mediocre movies saved by their soundtrack but Warcraft is not one of them.
So my score would look like this: visuals 8 (at least it's not the kaleidoscope we see in World of Warcraft), acting 6, soundtrack 7 and story 3. The story and acting should weigh more in the final score in my opinion, so the average would be somewhere around 4."

",0.0,0.8524,2019-10-15 00:00:00,9,"Despite the fact that a lot of people criticized the film about its pace, character development, etc., this movie is still by far, the best video game movie adaptation that has hit the screens.I must first confess that I am a Warcraft fan and have played its video games, which is also why I can say that they really did a great job of condensing a long story in 2hrs. (It's like they compressed about 8 to 10 TV series episodes in 2hrs.) It was a good move because this movie, like what other people say, is more like a prequel.Basically, this movie is to simply to let the viewers know the why and what started the war between humans and orcs, in the fantasy world of warcraft. (In the video game, humans and orcs have been at war for hundreds of years.) In my opinion, it was unnecessary to build up the characters on this film because they will all be long dead if there will be a sequel. In short, what most people are criticizing about this film for, is going to become irrelevant, if there will be a part 2.The only thing that I really didn't like about the movie are the human soldiers. The body type of the soldiers in the video game are more like a Dwayne Johnson, or a Dave Bautista body type."
" Warcraft
",0.0,0.9331,2019-10-05 00:00:00,7,"Warcraft is a fascinating movie. Mostly because the enjoyment of it seems to heavily rely on the connection you have with the source material.The first time I watched it, I'd never played the game and really knew nothing about that world. As a result, the movie was a mess that jumped from weird place to place filled with characters I knew nothing about and didn't particularly care for. Had I have rated it then, it would have hovered around a 3.After that first viewing I was eventually drawn into World of Warcraft and played quite a bit of it. When I saw the movie sitting on the shelf I figured I would give it another try and WoW! It was a completely different experience. Suddenly those characters felt so much more important. The weird locations weren't nonsensical anymore, in fact I knew exactly where they were relative to each other and how to get there. The entire world had become richer as I'd grown more connected to it.That seems to be the experience most people have with it too. If you're a fan of the game, this will probably be a fun experience for you. If not... I really wouldn't bother with it."

2.The story felt rushed.
3.CGI not good not bad.
4.Dialog was poorly written.
5.Short and slow battles with no real excitement.
6.The actors were not right for this movie (the looks, the acting, outfits just nothing)
7.A lot of poetry like story
The list goes on and on.
It was just sad to watch a wonderful game like this with such a wonderful story to be portrayed like this as if they haven't seen ''Lord Of The Rings'', Vikings or even Game Of Thrones.
At least i got nostalgic and started playing World Of Warcraft Classic again :).

" Not as good as the short-cinematics that Blizzard puts out...
",-0.3412,-0.6596,2019-09-10 00:00:00,7,"It's sad that that really any of these cinematics are a better story and more action packed than the Warcraft film... why did they spend 160million USD on a full cast/crew/actors when they could just spend like 10million USD to put the animation team at Blizzard on a FULL TIME cinematic-making schedule? I bet that that team can crank out a 2hr full feature cinematic in a year or so... and it would perform WAY better than the Warcraft film did... 30million views on YT, will probably translate to the same views in the cinema, so that's 300million USD gross easily, from a 10million USD budget... AND it would be better. That being said... the Warcraft film is good, but not great or amazing."

It's a movie that was made with love and care not only to satisfy fans of the video game series, but also to introduce newcomers to the world of Warcraft and everyone after seeing it will probably be interested to know more about the lore that was created. You can tell that Duncan Jones really did know what he was doing and cared while making the movie, but he could have done way better with the script; the human story; the music; the cinematography and the human characters (although King Llane Wrynn, Medivh and Khadgar were the best), while the orcs were the most interesting and the ones, who were given more development."
" Horde Vs Alliance & Alliance Vs Horde
",0.0,0.991,2019-07-03 00:00:00,9,"The long anticipated Warcraft movie comes from a huge video game franchise, via Blizzard Entertainment. From the 1994 title, Orcs and Humans to the hugely successful World of Warcraft - many fans will reminisce over their fondest moments from this much beloved series. Video game movie adaptations, however, more often than not do miss the mark; here's why this movie gets it right.This movie is a lot deeper than good guys Vs bad guys, the real enemy pulling the strings within the shadows is never actually revealed, although there are hints laid throughout the story to suggest darker forces at work. Warcraft shows that there are heroes on both sides of the conflict and fundamentally one must understand that Warcraft is not a human centric story but a universe containing many other races: Elves, Dwarves, Demons etc.. sympathising with both factions adds value to the whole story.The character portrayls are both faithful to the source material and interesting. The human leaders are a mixture of royalty and mages with conflicting opinions and agendas where as the Orcish Horde are a shamanistic and tribal faction of warriors with a strong adherence to tradition and honour. These opposing factions collide in fantastical battles, weighing physical might against ingenuity and craft.Overall the plot only scratches the surface of the lore but it is beautifully executed, from the intricate detail on armour and weapons to the raw arcane power of the human mages.Take note that there is a theme of corruption in both factions and both human and orcs have powerful heroes who can be seen wielding corrupted fel magics. When you see that this movie is an opening to a much bigger story, it will come across much more as a very well presented first chapter in an epic fantasy novel."
" my notes
",0.0,-0.9763,2019-06-30 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely horrible. the only redeeming quality is some good CGI on the orc. Other than that EVERYTHING was terrible. this was like mortal kombat with better CGI. THE WORST DIALOGUE EVER. And the awful acting made the horrible dialogue sound even worse. there were so many times when the dialogue didn't even make sense. One person would say something, then the other person would respond in a way that has nothing to do with what the first person said. For example, ""Where are we going"" ... ""We must fight as one"" (end scene). If you don't fully pay attention you may let it slide. But if you do, you will notice the conversation does not flow at all like any conversation should. They just say what the movie wants them to say.Another problem is that this movie tried to be primarily story-based. A movie like this really should have been a fun popcorn flick with good action and some funny banter between the characters. Instead, they tried to make this complex story that was so scattered and all over the place. And I didn't care about any of it. Why? Because it was useless. Why? Because the characters were useless. I didn't like any of them except the main orc character, and barely. All of the humans were pointless. So much bad acting.I didn't even get to the worst part of the acting. IMO, Paula Patton is the worst popular actress in hollywood today. I have noticed this in many of her past movies. She makes the same face for everything. She furrows her brow, that's it. Regardless of the emotion, it's that face. All her lines sounded soooooo awkward. Her romance was SOOOOO AWKWARD. Completely forced. I think she also made me like Mission Impossible 4 less, and she was terrible in 2 Guns and Deja Vu.Other than all the terrible things in the movie, I figured it would at least have some good war scenes, since it's called WARcraft. Nope. Not one action scene stood out to me. And there were barely any of them. This movie was SO boring. I kept thinking, can we please get this moving along. But no, the story... we need more story (sarcasm). The only cool scenes were the magic ones.Adam was right on this one. I am baffled that so many users liked this movie. I thought maybe it was just a movie for the fans, but I don't even feel like there was that much from the games. plus even if it's for the fans, it wasn't entertaining at all. It was so bland and typical (1 viewing)"

",0.0,0.9855,2019-05-19 00:00:00,9,"To begin with, I have to say I'm not Warcraft fan. I played the game occasionally, but I never gave too much thought to it nor read anything related to this lore, so I'm not competent to say if movie is faithful to original story or not. But I am fan of epic fantasy and it's my favorite genre. The only thing that somewhat bothered me was that two hours is not nearly enough to tell this story proper. Fact that movie feels incomplete is acceptable, cause it is obvious this is just the base for movies that will follow and this franchise looks very promising. But even just introduction to this world can not fit in only two hours. It needs at least three hours, or even two movies for this part of the story to be told right. Beside that I have no other objections. It is very good movie. But they call it The Lord of the Rings for the new generation. That's where I must draw a line. However good this movie is it is not worthy to be even compared to LOTR. Not only it is blasphemy to say that Warcraft is better or equally good, but they are beyond any comparison. Even after fifteen years nothing came even close to LOTR, let alone overthrow it from the throne of the genre. Maybe this movie standing alone deserves higher rating than what I rated it, and if there was no LOTR maybe I would rate it much higher, but LOTR set standards so high for this genre and in every single aspect it so much better than Warcraft, that on the scale where LOTR is ten, I simply can not give this movie more than seven. Still, I warmly recommend this adventure to all genre lovers and I can not wait for the sequels."

I know Warcraft 3, but did not play WoW much, I even watched this movie twice and still I have been entertained greatly.Some people wrote, that they didnt like the characters. Durotan was a great character: full of wisdom. I liked his calm way of solving problems. Medivh and Khadgar were very interesting characters also and all of them fit perfectly into the Warcraft world. Only Lothar was a bit unsympathic in the beginnning.There is another thing I liked so much: I was often wondering, why there are not so many fantasy movies with a lot of spells, like in the games. With the spells you can play with beautiful effects, they would fit in there a lot. And here you have many spells.
Another thing that I liked was the perspective of the film: I saw much more about the orc culture than that of the humans. It was very interesting.

In short, for the ashes, the things given are too small; for the ordinary viewers, there is too much information about filling ducks.

The movie is riddled with with names that you would only understand the meaning and importance of if you were familiar with WC beforehand and they are not explained in the movie.It is not all doom and gloom however, because Warcraft is quite beautifully made and the action scenes are decent. If you would like to watch a fantasy movie with fighting and fiction then you might actually enjoy Warcraft a fair bit.Verdict:
In short, if you have high expectations, then you will probably be dissatisfied with this movie unless you are a WC fan, since this movie does not contain much originality and a confusing and messy storyline.
The movie does offer some beautiful scenery however and some grand fighting scenes, so if you just want to watch a movie that has some action and/or just to get time going, then you might get some good entertainment from watching Warcraft.
My rating and review takes the viewpoint of someone that is not a WC fan which is why I give Warcraft a 5, however if you are fan if WC already then it could be a 7."

" Good Movie. Critics probably cannot embrace committed adaptation.
",-0.2677,0.8495,2019-01-03 00:00:00,8,It's fun. I like the story. The characters have inner conflicts. The story is complex and believable. The cartoonish style is of course bold and ambitious but it feels like finally somebody had the guts to make a video game /mythology adaptation rather true to its origin and is not credited for it.
" Am i missing something?
",-0.296,0.9452,2019-01-03 00:00:00,1,"1) I literally just created this profile 5 min ago to comment on this after seeing the word ""Great"" used in every second comment.
2) I had been waiting for this movie since 2007 when it was first announced and watched it upon its release.
3) Just keep in mind, this movie cost as much as ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" to produce...
4) I never comment on movies, so excuse my lack of 'professional movie review' terminology, however i feel that this is one film i am qualified to talk about.Yes, i did have high expectations for this movie and i honestly thought that Blizzard had the opportunity to temporarily make WoW the largest MMORPG in the world once more if they play their cards right.Whether you have heard of the story of Warcraft or not, you need to understand that Warcraft has arguably the richest story-line out of anything ever written and even some 'random' characters have very deep history.So considering the above, the movie was utterly disappointing. This should never have been a movie in the first place, it should have been a series with 3 to 5 seasons of 10, 1 hour episodes in each season.This movie was so rushed that when i tried to briefly explain to my wife (who is not familiar with the story) who the extremely important character which is integral to the story was (because the movie did not bother to do it at all), by the time i could finish my sentence the character was already dead...When Garona Halforcen went from talking dirty to talking about her terrible past basically in a span of about 7 seconds had to be the cringest dialog in history.Basically if you have had no expectation what so ever and have no idea about the story, objectively speaking, especially for a less mature viewer who does not take movies to seriously and who values fast, mindless action above all, the movie is about a 5.5 or 6/10. If you are more mature and not familiar with Warcraft and value a decently constructed plot with some character development then the movie is about a 3 or 4/10. If you are Chinese person who lives in China then, for got knows what reason, the movie is a 10/10 for you. If you like a well constructed story and character development and are familiar with the story (and understand the potential this movie had) then it is a 0/10.The movie needed to collect USD 450 million to break even so i am happy it i did not reach that mark and OFFICIALLY flopped because it sucked!"

" Warcraft : Feels like rain
",0.3612,0.8375,2018-12-08 00:00:00,7,Warcraft (2016) was based on a video game which is 20 years old and still loved among video game fanatics globally.But I never played it. So the criticism by game fans and critics of making injustice to the video game's universe by the filmmaker's is invalid to me.So as film fanatic this was kind of like a drizzle to the fantasy film genre in a long time. Besides the Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit franchise there were not many fantasy films in the modern context.The benchmark LOTR kept was intense and hard to achieve for another fantasy film but this tries okay with new innovative CGI and story arcs.The characters and emotions are flat. But that's what fantasy is.A really good fantasy action film.Overall - 3.5/5
" Needs more substance
",0.0,0.976,2018-12-01 00:00:00,5,"WARCRAFT is yet another movie adaptation of a popular video game. I used to play the original WARCRAFT back in the late 1990s when it was much different and more straightforward when compared to the sprawling WORLD OF WARCRAFT MMORPG available today. Sadly, the film turns out to be merely lukewarm, a rehash of fantasy tropes and cliches that inevitably harks back to LORD OF THE RINGS as well as AVATAR and about a dozen other influences. I'm no fan of the motion capture technology used in cinema today and it's rather ineffective here; the orcs themselves look like nothing more than slightly awkward CGI creations and a ton of possibly decent performances from the likes of Daniel Wu et al are wasted within them. The human plot is simplistic in the extreme and although the likes of Travis Fimmel and Ben Foster do their best, they can in actuality do very little with the cliches they're given. On the plus side, some of the sprawling action scenes are visually impressive, particularly at the climax, and the non-orc CGI effects are frankly great; I just wish we had more substance to go with the style."
" War is upon us...
",-0.5994,0.9966,2018-11-30 00:00:00,6,"""Warcraft"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch the planet of humans being attacked by the Orcs of Draenor. Orcs attacked Earth because their own planet was destroyed by an evil magic and their powerful warlock created a portal to the world of humans. In order for the portal to be open, their warlock captures many people and uses them as a fuel. Everything seems lost but always there is room for heroes.I liked this movie because it was very interesting, it had good CGIs and also a nice plot. I liked the interpretation of Travis Fimmel who played as Anduin Lothar, Paula Patton who played as Garona and she was very good at it and Ben Foster who played as Medivh. The direction which was made by Duncan Jones it was simple but interesting in its own way with many action scenes and very good CGIs.To sum up, I have to say that ""Warcraft"" is a nice movie to watch and I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much. Something that is very important and this movie succeeded in it was the combination between of action and romance. Since I am a fan of Warcraft and I had high expectations from this movie I have to admit that I wasn't disappointed by it."

" Not bad! Gives appetite for a sequel!
",0.5321,0.9684,2018-11-20 00:00:00,8,"Saw the film twice. first time didn't like it, second time thought it was rather good!Unlike the typical stereotype good vs evil Fantasy films, World of Warcraft's plot has at least something of a grayscale to it (no intricate political thriller for sure, and yes a one-dimensional supervillain, but at least a touch of gray here and there). Characters are refreshingly statesmanly sacrificing themselves for national interest of sorts, with surprisingly unhappy endings. Makes it different to the usual stuff and a fun viewing.The visuals and creatures are cool. Only the colours are somewhat too vibrant looking like an Alice in Winderland type candy land.. that and Orc bodies too large with tiny heads and huge hands could do with a design upgrade.All in all, fun viewing experience, has lots of potential to further develop visuals and characters, and makes hungry for more. Go Sequel!"

" Lost in Space '98 Levels Of Imbecilic
",-0.3182,-0.9769,2018-11-04 00:00:00,2,"Warcraft may possibly be the dumbest big budget Hollywood film since Battlefield Earth, without any of its precious unintentional comedy. That's not to say it's the worst one since Battlefield Earth, there are many more worthy of that title, but from a sheer case of internal and emotional logic, Warcraft is the most mindbogglingly idiotic trainwreck I've seen since. It's a visually ugly, humorless, braindead catastrophe that could be outwritten by a 9 year old with one of the worst endings I've ever seen. Additionally, it gets worse the more I actually think about it. The film has been in development Hell since the mid-2000s with Uwe Boll offering to direct and, honestly, I may have turned out preferring his film. At least I could laugh at how bad that one might have been. In its current state, Warcraft is just tedious.The first thing to know about Warcraft is that nearly the entire film is exposition and world building. It feels less like an actual movie and more like an introductory video game cutscene. Warcraft doesn't care about developing its characters or making them relatable and interesting and complex. It's far more interested in shoving in as many Easter eggs to in game locations and lore as they can. Those two things should exist to strengthen the story and the characters, not the other way around. Even as a casual fan of the games, I could care less about how faithful it is the source material when there is nothing close to a coherent narrative.Remember in my Spider-Man 3 review where I said the characters behaved the way they did to service the plot and not out of any actual emotional logic or reasoning? Imagine that x100 and you have Warcraft. Garona is the adult daughter of a human and an Orc despite Orcs only just beginning to interact with humans. Anduin and Garona fall in love immediately despite sharing nothing in common and having only about 2 scenes of highly limited interaction with each other. There's a scene where the evil Orc warlock Gul'dan cheats in an honor duel to which the Orcs are somehow surprised at his lack of honor. Why they would be surprised by the dishonorable actions of a monster who literally devours the life of entire worlds, I have no idea. The film then builds up this moment as if it's going to be a major turning point in the story, only for Gul'dan to kill the first Orcs to dissent to his rule and for the story to continue and Orcs remain loyal as if nothing happened. The King's brilliant solution to bring peace between Orcs and humans is to have Garona, the only Orc who humans seem to unanimously trust, kill him to prove herself to the Horde...And then the Orcs and humans go to war anyway. The entire film really is headache inducingly preposterous, I could hardly believe what I was witnessing. I do strongly remember slowly sinking into my theater seat in embarrassment for calling myself a fan of this franchise as I watched this unparalleled idiotfest unfold.So everything I just listed sounds pretty stupid and incoherent, does it not? You may be thinking that it may at least be bad in an entertaining way. Unfortunately, unlike the aforementioned Battlefield Earth, the actors aren't having nearly enough fun or energy to make the film enjoyable even on an ironic level. Paula Patton, Toby Kebbell and Clancy Brown are at least serviceable in their voice-heavy, animalistic portrayals of Orcish characters, but everyone else is clearly phoning it in. Travis Fimmell, Ben Foster and even the exceptionally talented Dominic Cooper are all sleep walking through this travesty, none of them are giving their best effort at all. This was very much a ""Read the lines, take the paycheck"" role for these actors. If the film was this much of a slog to force myself through as an audience member, I can only imagine the agonizing nightmare it was to film. Thank Christ that God awful sequel bait ending never went anywhere.Another thing worth noting is just how ugly the film is. As much as I hated The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, it at least somewhat had its own identity. If I was flipping through channels and managed to catch a Lord of the Rings movie on TV, I would know it was a Lord of the Rings movie. If I saw this on TV, I'd probably think it was a Malefecent spinoff. That or one of those unbearable Hobbit films. There is no style to this film, no atmosphere. It looks like every crappy, half-assed fantasy film released in the past 12 years. If the film was so low on substance, the least it could have is style, but unfortunately, Warcraft has neither.Apparently, this film is beginning to get something of a fanbase, but I can't for the life of me figure out why. Even as a fan of the games, this fan service trash hardly seems respectful. It's like the filmmakers couldn't think of a compelling story or characters so they just threw Easter eggs hoping they would stick. It's a boring, poorly acted, weakly characterized and ugly nightmare that I never want to watch again. There are so many better fantasy epics than this. There are so many better video game movies than this. I don't have to settle for this bottom-of-the-barrel dumpster fire of used diapers."
" Critics Seem to Wish They Were Screenwriters
",0.128,0.9419,2018-11-04 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed the film even though I've never played the game. The fantasy world created was just as it should be. The characters were deep enough for a decent story. I have to admit I'm not a fan of open endings like this but unlike the critics it's not about how I think the story should go or how whimsical the characters should be. Just because it's a game-based film doesn't mean it should be filled with comic relief. That's become cliche in most movies like this so I was glad it didn't go down that road. Probably more a 7 than an 8, but I tried to offset the rediculous negatives. This is no Lord of the Rings but it's still very much an enjoyable fantasy film."

The writers and director had a lot of material to express over a very short amount of time, what could take an entire novel to express they were able to deliver in a very concise movie. No scene was wasted, but more importantly, none of the scenes felt rushed.Travis Fimmel bought into his role, and while it may seem ridiculous from the outside (the source material being warcraft), he was convincing, entertaining, and not alone. All the other cast members displayed levels of talent that truly impressed me and made me want more. I know no one will ever read this review, being two years since this movie came out, but I'm writing this review for me, because i really enjoyed this movie despite my heavy initial bias against it."

I considered Warcraft to be all around underdog - until I saw the movie. My original ""Oh, I'll look and see..."" turned to ""I want sequel!""Yes, it's infantile, naive, predictable and artificial. But... Do you want solid action? Here it is. Intimate moments? No problem. Heroism and epicness? Cool orcs? There you go. Do you want art/new LOTR? Sorry, this is a movie based on the high-cliché-fantasy videogame, not the work of Tolkien of 21st century. Warcraft does exactly what it intends to do (transfer a videogame to big screen) in an enjoyable way, nothing more and nothing less. Pleasant surprise."
" The whole family really enjoyed this
",0.5563,0.947,2018-09-14 00:00:00,8,"I will start by saying I never played Warcraft or World of Warcraft or any other game similar to those. I am a fan of this genera of film, so I started watching with few expectation aside from being entertained. I was not disappointed, the CGI was very well done, the story line was clearly presented in the movie so that someone with no knowledge of the game knew what was going on. I thought the acting was really good for the most part, there were a couple of places it missed the mark, but overall, very well done. We felt the character development on the Orc side was well done and elevated them above the mindless killing NPCs we had WAY back in the old AD&D days. Lots of fun for a light fantasy adventure film that did not seem to take itself too seriously but hit the marks for entertainment. If there is a sequel, we will surely get it as well."

" Not sure if I watched a film or the actual video game
",-0.2411,0.9339,2018-08-16 00:00:00,5,"Firstly, I've not played Warcraft so unlike most reviewers here giving glowing reviews, I am unbiased.The first problem I have is that for the first half hour I had no idea what the bloody hell was going on! There was a small voice over explaining that a war had been going on for a long time but that was it, if like me you are unfamiliar with the world you'll be none the wiser. Having said that after the initial confusion I did get the gist enough to enjoy the story as the film progressed.Secondly, there is very little character development and I found it very hard to sympathise with the human characters, I didn't really care if they lived or died. Conversely the Orc's development worked well and because of this I found myself siding with the characters that were technically the bad guys.Now, the biggy... there is so much CGI. Admittedly on the most part at least, it is unquestionably well done but I would say that for three quarters of the movie the only real things on screen are the human actors. It makes me question if this is a live action movie or an animated movie with human characters inserted. What's more it's unnecessary - LOTR managed a 12 hour trilogy with convincing Orcs in prosthetics. The Orcs size here could have been augmented with CGI of course, and the fantasy landscapes needn't have been full CGI either. The film suffers because of a 'CGI it because we can mentality. Thing is though, the non-CGI sets looked like they were lifted from an Erroll Flynn Robin Hood movie of the 1940s with obvious Styrofoam castle walls that screamed cheap. Not enough money left after paying the techies for their pixel magic maybe?Then we come to the actors. Don't get me wrong the acting is fine though they do suffer from a script full of quasi-medieval English (I half expected a ""forsooth"" or a ""wherefore art""), but the casting people just seem to have raided every popular TV series going without casting a single A list star save for a pointless cameo from Glenn Close. Maybe after investing in the sets they should've diverted some CGI budget into casting?So, yes, I have a few problems with the film but it has to be said I enjoyed it. Once I figured out what was going on I got into it. The story is pretty good and benefits from not being a typical 'humans good, other species bad' fantasy film with half the focus (and better development) given to 'the bad guys'. Travis Fimmel does seem to be playing Ragnar Lothbrök without the accent but it's not a huge issue. I don't think it counts as a spoiler to say that they're clearly setting up a sequel at the end, and I will give it a watch. An average fantasy movie that does have many faults but there is hope that this could develop into an enjoyable franchise."

And on that point, my biggest praise I can give this film is that the aesthetics are completely loyal to how the games look and feel. However, this and the fairly competent action direction don't make up for the rest of this film feeling so empty. It has the most basic of plot-lines, the world-building doesn't expand much beyond the occasional fan-pandering, and an ending that is completely pointless beyond the set up for a sequel we will probably never see. I should probably hate this more than I do, but I left with less of a sour taste in my mouth as much as I did with an unanswered query: who is this for?!

As well as more minor characters. The story plot follows the World of Warcraft game lore for the most part with some exceptions for Garona to bring the adventure along. Having a strong knowledge of that lore is what turned it from a 7 to a 9 for me as all the details were there in the settings and in the characters. And for World of Warcraft Players, having an understanding of the lore and general story already having played the game enhances the film as you can envision what you know has happened outside of this story laid on top of what you see in the film. The actual production of this film, CGI etc. is amazing. The Director's work in maintaining continuity and performance is solid, especially given the complexity of CGI.And the nod to a sequel at the end has me hoping that Blizzard will follow through with the same Class A Production on a sequel soon!"

I'm not really sure what to make of this film. It was entertaining, I suppose, on a certain level, but in general I just didn't like it. The 'love story' was so utterly pathetic and annoying.

In fact when I first heard about it I was positive I wouldn't like it, I'm just not into movies based on video games.  But that very thing was what caused me to enjoy it so much, because I knew this was based on a video game, I could totally accept the characters and the visuals in this film, and they blended in with the live actors so well it was hard to tell how it was done  Very nice addition to Duncan Jones/Zowie Bowie's (I can't believe that this is the guy making these movies) repertoire, I remember when the kid was born. And now he's made a few really great movies, including source code.  I liked Paula Patton from ghost protocol, and I believe I saw her in mirrors as well. There were a few other names that I always like seeing, Ben Foster and Dominic Cooper, and Toby Kebbel and Clancy brown, not to mention Ruth Negga from agents of shield.  But the St. Louis film critics association should get stuffed, awarding this ""worst film of the year"". I award them ""worst film critics ever"". This is just amazing because the buzz about this film was highly positive at the time and by reading through this now, you think it was a total flop. But it actually wasn't. Everybody that I spoke to loved this film, all of my friends, and I heard that this was great from more sources than I had expected too: I was expecting people to say that they hated it. But in fact the only people who hated it where the St. Louis film critics Association. It was that positive buzz that made me interested in this in the first place, and here comes the SLFCA to quash that. Well the hell with them, I will have to remember that if they ever award any other films worst of the year, I will have to immediately go out and watch those films The thing that amazes me is that I normally don't go for this kind of thing but it was done so well. I had been wondering why there hasn't been talk about a sequel, because I thought this movie was going to be the first one in some kind of new Ur fantasy trilogy, but thanks to the SLFCA and other trolls, we don't get to see this story told any further.

" A fantastic movie!!!
",0.6679,0.8983,2018-03-27 00:00:00,10,"Warcraft is one of those movies that is an example of how adaptations should be done. Please note: I have not ever played the game! To start, I have to wonder again and again at the 'movie critics' who've rated this and other movies so poorly. The plot was well-developed, the acting was exactly how you'd want from the genre, and the cinematography was very well done! I can go on and on about the tremendous job on the cgi, which surpasses so many other movies that have gotten far better critic review.I suspect Warcraft didn't do so well due to poor marketing or representation in the US, because while it is a gamer's fanbase, the movie stands well on its own. I truly wish to see the sequels. Warcraft is exactly the gritty, passionate kind of movie I wanted to see!"
" No Craft in this War.
",-0.7798,-0.9749,2018-03-26 00:00:00,4,"This is a terrible movie, that's also incredibly messy and made little sense while choking on its own umbilical cord. Warcraft is all over the place. It has no focus, and its story suffers greatly from a sequence of events that come together about as well as dipping sushi in ketchup.Maybe fans of the Warcraft game understood what the hell was going on in this film, but the rest of us were wondering ""WTF"" during ""WTB"" (Warcraft: The Beginning). The character developments were also ridiculously flat. The relationships had absolutely no life; Anduin and his son. Anduin and Garona. The king ad his queen. Anduin and his sister. Anduin and the king. This list of these half to barely developed run-of-the-mill characters and more so, relationships, could really span almost, if not the entire cast.The CGI started off okay to good, then of course as the movie progressed, the intensity and necessity of the visual effects grew, and unfortunately, grew beyond the films budget and/or the director's ability to create the world he needed to. Warcraft was CGI heavy, extremely so, and that made it run the risk of starting to feel cartoonish, unrealistic, and even worse, fake. The Green Screens are so obvious, especially at the end when the Guardian to be guy was handing a sword to Anduin, amongst many other parts in this film.The fight sequences were meh. The acting was meh. The composition was meh. The directing and cinematography, meh. Visual effects, meh. The editing... Meh. 4.4/10."

Yep, its complete fanservice to fans of the game, but also I LOVED the way they didn't skimp on the brutality of the action, I was surprised they didn't issue a higher rating for the frankly, if you think about it, horrific endings some of the alliance humans end up with.The CGI must be commended, its really quite good and very believable. Yes, the story is very simplistic, DONT try to compare it to lord of the rings like almost all the critics, its a different movie and a different goal. The music and the stakes really help get the otherwise uninvested to enjoy themselves, but don't walk into this expecting a critically acclaimed movie. This is something to turn off, delve into a new fantasy world and let it take you along for the journey, with the characters whist basking in the CGI.People bag on the acting but lets be real, you didn't come here for the academy awards, you came here for the big badass human VS orc showdown with a hint of Warcraft nostalgia.For what this movie is, if you're a fan of the games or a fan of grand fantasy, I think you'll like it."

It's just looks like an attempt to grab a few more bucks from the WoW crowd.

Well, you get everything a fantasy and action fan craves for - beautiful pictures, great heroes and battles and stuff but somehow in this movie everything just looks and feels like a cliché and made without care. If you got a dish you taste if a cook is cooking with care to details and he likes his job and tries to surprise and please you or if he is just doing everything by the books like an automate. That's somehow how Warcraft hit me - everything is here but it tastes like convenience food: artificial and boring to the tongue and mind.

Again, I really hope they make another movie!!!!"
" Too fast!
",0.0,0.9843,2018-02-15 00:00:00,7,"I think the story should have built up better to the orc invasion. I believe a director should always make us fall in love with his characters, and the only way to do that is to give us a story. If he had taken the time to build up a story for each of the main characters, I believe a lot of people would have liked it better. even if the cost was less time for original story line. The first lord of the rings movie was 3 hours of practically nothing. Just building a bond between the characters and making us love them with some drama.So jumping to the story line too soon, I believe, was Duncan Jones mistake. And casting Dominic Cooper for king Llane. A king should always have the face of a wise man or a veteran. Dominic Cooper just looks like a regular guy. I also think that when a new idea is being introduced, the pace should be slow when it comes to magic and supernatural powers. Because when it is thrown out there right at the start, it just loses its charm. Also people see things relatively, and the director didn't stress on things that would have wowed us, like the difference in strength between orcs and humans. the fights should have been horrific and scary.But I still like the movie and hope to see a sequel soon."
" Really Bad Movie.
",-0.5849,0.0644,2018-01-08 00:00:00,5,"I generally liked Warcraft. The acting and visuals were fine. I felt like I was stepping into a videogame. I thought the film stumbled in that it depended on the audience knowing the backstory of the games. They provided some of the information, but the overall plot is just absent. I still have no idea why Medivh did what he did. How did he become corrupted by the Fel? It doesn't make any sense. It is just setting up the next movie."
" The best video game adaptation yet!
",0.6696,0.9313,2017-12-31 00:00:00,8,"After seeing so many video game adaptations in the movie industry, I didn't think that there'd be any good ones. The Resident Evil movies were OK, but I'm sure some of the fans of those games weren't too pleased.Then came WarCraft.I never played very many Blizzard games until StarCraft and WarCraft, and those were in 2000. But I now enjoy WarCraft as my favorite Blizzard franchise and also my favorite of all the Tolkien-inspired fantasy sagas. When I heard about the movie, I was really excited. I saw the movie with my father and while he didn't understand it I was entertained. And I look forward to the further entries in the series, should they pursue them. Hey, Resident Evil got several movies. Why not this?"
" Best fantasy story since Game of Thrones, hands down. Duncan Jones did great!!
",0.8715,0.978,2017-12-18 00:00:00,10,"First off, I've played WoW a bit, not much but a bit. My brother however lost years of his life to this game. When he saw it, he told me ""It was trash"". This is why it took me so long to see it. So today after work, I put it on with him in the room to see if he'd demand me to turn it off. He didn't, we watched it. Scene after scene I got more excited about what was going on, asking him to update me on the nerd bits that I don't know about. Little by little, even he agreed that it was awesome.I believe for him it was Ben Foster's take on the Guardian. Forgive me if I don't spell things WoW nerds know about. I think Ben Foster is one of best actors out there and there are a couple monologues that he did quite well in this film.For me however I was overly excited about the Orcs and how well the CGI was, even though very obviously fake, the facial expressions plus the voice acting and story's were downright amazing.And to top it off Ben Foster becoming a bad ass demon in the end was just killer. I can't wait for a sequel. This was so much better than the new Star Wars and absolutely all of the (live action only as the animated LotR films are awesome) Lord of the Rings films. If a studio is listening....bring Duncan Jones back. Continue the story. If not. Thank you very much for an amazing film!"
" Oh ... dear gods ... no. Just no!
",-0.2714,-0.9753,2017-12-12 00:00:00,1,"In 2000, someone had the ""fantastic"" idea of creating a ""Dungeons and Dragons"" movie. It was a travesty. Such a travesty, in fact, that no one has spoken of making anything similar since. It got close to destroying the career of Jeremy Irons and every other ""actor"" and ""actress"" involved in that steaming pile of bovine fecal matter has been forever tarnished by their association therewith, and have failed to make it in Hollywood. And then came Warcraft.A worthy successor in terms of sheer, utter awfulness. Ten minutes in, I was laughing at how bad it was. IF I had paid money in the cinema to see this talentless piece of unspeakable awfulness, I would have walked out and re-considered paying for movie-tickets for a while. I'd have felt -robbed-. The acting is hammy, non-existent or just plain bad. The sets are ridiculously awful, to the point of people riding past green-screen so poorly executed that you can SEE where the plastic and cardboard trees stop and the green-screen begins. Close-ups of armour reveals that it seems to be painted by a blindfolded four-year-old. The King's helmet is so poorly fitting he can barely look out of it, and it tends to -not- -turn- when he turns his head inside it. The fight scenes are just plain dreadful, with anyone NOT CGI, having had obvious trouble with where to hit the markers that the orks would later replace, to the point of not following through on their attacks or flailing aimlessly in the air. Medivh is criminal in his ridiculousness. Look ... Warcraft is a series of games that never took itself particularly seriously. The jokes were plentiful ... anyone who played them probably had fun multi-clicking on any unit on the map to eventually have them flip out and badmouth you for bothering them. The sheer, unadulterated silliness of it all permeats the games. But the movie has none of it. It tries to take itself seriously and fails -miserably- on every -single- count. Within the first fifteen minutes, you have to be able to tell just under twenty -named- characters apart and make sense of their motivations and place within the story. The only character which comes close to believability for fans of the games, is Gul'dan, who is as vicious and nasty as one could hope for. Except of course, when he delivers a stillborn baby and promptly saves its life. Oh ... oops. Or his voice. Good heavens, his -voice-. Weedy little sniveling git that they made him. He could have been an overgrown goblin, instead of having the raspy, horrid inflection he did in the games. Please, whatever you do, do not waste part of your life watching this movie.Go watch paint dry. Or listen to German schlÃ¤ger music. Try stacking coins to a record height. ANYTHING ... just -anything- ... but watching this unholy travesty, this -waste- of film-equipment and this death-knell of acting careers. Or so we can hope ... if there is -any- justice in the world. The ... single ... worst ... movie ... I ... have ... ever ... seen. Ed Wood was Academy Awared material compared to this drivel."

There is a human vs orcs battle, and of course the typical double agents and unlikely love story. The film leads to a sequel.In this story the Orcs are more like Klingons with a code of honor than the Orcs we witnessed in LOTR. There is a lot of magic, with a fear of ""The Fel"" a magic which sucks the life out of a living thing. (Guess why the Orcs keep relocating.) The film is based on a video game, and unlike ""Final Fantasy VII"" movie, it is watchable. The CGI and humans blended in perfectly. It was incredible to watch.The game/film builds upon what we loved about LOTR, Harry Potter and previous RPGs. It combines it into an epic tale.On the downside, I didn't like the actors. I think names like Liam Neeson and Zoe Salada would have brought much more to the screen. I liked our hero mage Callan, I just didn't think Burkely Duffield was right for the role. The dialogue needed some zip. And since this is a film and no longer a game, the love story/drama needed better development.Disclaimer: I have briefly played WOW when my sister left her computer on while she had to talk to a bill collector on the phone. Certainly having WOW is worth going late on a mortgage payment. I managed to get her level 70 mage killed in five minutes. How is that even possible? I enjoyed the feature and look forward to a more promising sequel.Guide: No swearing sex or nudity. Killing without gore and blood splatter. One sex talk scene about wanting to ""lie with me"" and he would get hurt."

" Better than playing World of Warcraft cause it only wastes two hours of your life
",0.5719,-0.9467,2017-10-19 00:00:00,2,"Lo verily and forsooth they did doth make a Warcraft movie and zounds did it doth so suck. Huzzah all pieces of this movie were lame and sh*tty, prithee dear reader and I shall reveal the tale of woe of why Warcraft doth choke on knob- Once upon a time people wasted time playing an on-line video game, so much time and money was wasted that to justify the expenditure a movie was green lit by presumably a bunch of rapist producers and studio executives. Their goal? To create a very mediocre way to recoup an investment in The World Of Warcraft and Blizzard Games proprietary rights. Were the movie makers successful? I guess so?"
" Good, but not great
",-0.5409,0.9855,2017-10-03 00:00:00,7,"To begin with, I have to say I'm not Warcraft fan. I played the game occasionally, but I never gave too much thought to it nor read anything related to this lore, so I'm not competent to say if movie is faithful to original story or not. But I am fan of epic fantasy and it's my favorite genre. The only thing that somewhat bothered me was that two hours is not nearly enough to tell this story proper. Fact that movie feels incomplete is acceptable, cause it is obvious this is just the base for movies that will follow and this franchise looks very promising. But even just introduction to this world can not fit in only two hours. It needs at least three hours, or even two movies for this part of the story to be told right. Beside that I have no other objections. It is very good movie. But they call it The Lord of the Rings for the new generation. That's where I must draw a line. However good this movie is it is not worthy to be even compared to LOTR. Not only it is blasphemy to say that Warcraft is better or equally good, but they are beyond any comparison. Even after fifteen years nothing came even close to LOTR, let alone overthrow it from the throne of the genre. Maybe this movie standing alone deserves higher rating than what I rated it, and if there was no LOTR maybe I would rate it much higher, but LOTR set standards so high for this genre and in every single aspect it so much better than Warcraft, that on the scale where LOTR is ten, I simply can not give this movie more than seven. Still, I warmly recommend this adventure to all genre lovers and I can not wait for the sequels.7/10"
" Badcraft
",0.0,0.5635,2017-09-04 00:00:00,4,"Unfortunately I've lost all hope that someday we may have a good movie based on video games. In favor: excellent cinematography, very credible CGI during most of the film and well made and choreographed battles and fights. A treat for the eyes. Against: everything else. The mythology of Warcraft is so vast that it becomes overwhelming to want to condense everything into just a 2 hour movie, which is the main reason why everything else has failed. For those who played the games and read the books this might not be a problem, but whoever comes to this movie from scratch can be a little confusing at first, though not discouraging for the film experience. Introducing the Orcs as characters with history and motivations alongside with Humans was also a bad decision, because we have so many characters that it becomes impossible to get involved with them, being that when they die or something tragic happens the viewer does not care because they were not characterized and developed enough to relate emotionally to them. The casting of the actors does not seem to me to have been well done, as most of them do not convey any charisma (perhaps with the surprising exception of Paula Patton who plays Garona, an half-breed Orc - and here comes the first plot hole: if she came from a world completely dominated by Orcs, she is half- Orc half-what? Maybe in a sequel we'll have the answer).The idea of this film would work better if it were much longer, or better still, as two films, one from the point of view of Humans and another from the point of view of Orcs. That said, the movie entertains, and really had potential to be something remarkable, and it's a shame that it has not reached that potential that the Warcraft universe deserves. But we should already be accustomed to it, that every video-game-based movie sucks."
" Nice Fantasy Movie, Expected Better Action & Visuals

The performances are good too but I feel there isn't any one act that I can single out because this movie is heavy on actors in body suits(the orcs) and also lot of effects. The action disappointed me however and it could be because all the fights seem to be happen within a very limited space or at least that's how it looked to me...they give out a visually cramped impression. Even the action choreography could have been better - nice but expected much more. The end hints a sequel so I hope that offers much more bang for the buck, both visually and the action or else, the part two or a three even could have a dismal run at the box office and compared unfairly with other fantasy movies like the hugely successful Hobbit or Lord of the Rings trilogies."

If you are familiar to the franchise you might pick up more subtle references, but it worked well even without knowing much beforehand.

" Rating: B-
",0.0,0.9991,2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"First of all, I consider myself a gamer and I did play World Of Warcraft for a little bit, but never actually learned to enjoy the game as one should. I'll try my best to look at this with a critic's opinion instead of a biased player because that's what I'm here for ... To review movies and not games.I really wanted this movie to be a major blockbuster, the best video game adaptation ever because every other video game with desires to become a film were hinged on this one (and I really want an Assassin's Creed series). The truth is that this is not as bad as the critics say, but it's not perfect either. It has some really great moments, but also a lot of issues. Let me start with the things I liked ...Duncan Jones as the director: God, was he great! There are some visually stunning action scenes where you can really feel bones cracking and heads being smashed. This is a gorgeous looking movie, there's a lot of CGI (really, a lot), but it's mostly well incorporated, especially in the battle sequences and on the orcs' appearance. Furthermore, the score is so addictive that I'm actually listening to the main theme while writing this review ... It transformed good scenes into amazing sequences!Durotan (Toby Kebbell) was the Frostwolf clan's chieftain and the character that I cared the most (and probably the only one). He blamed Gul'dan for the destruction of their world, so he tries to form an alliance with the humans to save his race from further misery. He is, by far, the best character in the entire movie. Travis Fimmel was good portraying Anduin Lothar, the commander of the humans' forces and a character that I didn't quite connected with. He has a stupid, nonsense romance with another character throughout the movie and that didn't help his story at all. Actually, one of the things that bugged me the most were the human characters since I didn't really care for any of them! Still, another character I liked was Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), he was pretty cool and I think the film should have used him more.When all the budget is spent on visual effects and directing, something has to suffer ... And that's the pacing and some plot issues. Oh my God, the pacing! I understand that hardcore fans of the game were completely fine with the jumping around from location to location ... For about 15min. After that, it's impossible not to feel the abrupt and constant transitions that almost made me lose sight of where the story was. This film tried to tell us in a 2-hour runtime what can barely be done in a 10-episode TV series! It's ludicrous to believe that this much material would be able to fit perfectly in a movie of such short length.Additionally, there are some characters that are introduced to us, near the end of the film, that come out of nowhere and suddenly we have to deal with them and how relevant they happen to be. They're mentioned a couple of times in the movie, but for the importance that they had, they should've got a lot more screen time. Also, as I mentioned above, there's a romance that is awfully bad, it's one of those love stories that nowadays (for some reason) every movie seems to need one and that didn't help the party at all.These are only a couple of examples on how the pacing ruined what could've been a great movie. There's some good characters, excellent directing and visual effects, some amazing fan-service scenes (more than I could think of, for sure), but the pacing brought the movie down in an enormous way as well as the narrative problems.Warcraft is still a great entertainment, especially for fans of the game, who will probably love this movie just for the battle sequences alone, but as a whole ... It should've been a lot better.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" Missed Opportunity - A Humorless Hard to Follow Mess
",-0.5574,0.6114,2017-08-01 00:00:00,4,"I wasn't expecting Lord of the Rings or a movie which strictly adhered to Warcraft lore. I was hoping for a good story populated with relatable characters. I was disappointed in that I saw neither. The movie had no sense of itself or what it wanted to do. I felt like it was trying too hard to appeal to a broad audience and lost itself in the process. There's a kind of charm to all the characters in the game that wasn't there in the movie. In the game, there's winks and nods in the form of pop culture references and humor abounds. This movie took itself way too seriously and what few stabs it made at humor fell terribly flat. I felt like the movie was saying, ""I am epic! See how epic I am? Behold all my epicness! I am SOOOOO EPIC!... Ummm... do you think I'm epic?""I had a very difficult time getting invested in the characters. When key characters died I found myself saying, ""So?"" and ""Who was that again?"" I believe the pacing was to blame along with splitting the viewer's attention between so many groups of people. I have to agree with other reviewers and say that I cared more about The Frostwolf Clan and Durotan than I did about anyone else. No offense to the actors playing human characters, but I thought they lacked charisma. It felt like they pulled actors out of a ren-fair and handed them a script.Finally, the plot was convoluted. We were dropped in the middle of the Orc's exodus to Azeroth with no exposition. From there, we were jetted from locale to locale unsure of why we went there or where we were going next. It's not Marlan Wayans Dungeons and Dragons bad. The acting was OK, the action was good, and they threw in a merloc so I'll bump it a point for that. All in all, I'm giving it a 4."

I think no one really can explain why none of the various attempts of adapting succeeded. They all feel kind of dumb and constructed. Warcraft is no exception, although there was hope with Duncan Jones directing this movie. He made one great and one good sci-fi-movie before and is known as a huge fan of the game.Some of the CGI in this movie looks surreal and Ben Fosters young but elderly magician didn't work for me. I liked the main orc character, but his character arc was wasted and felt poorly made. Nevertheless, most of the orc scenes felt like they were made for a game and not a movie. The main human character was flat and i did not buy him as a loving and carrying father. He simply seemed to be too young.Everything sad, there where some unexpected story points and the general world was very well carried out. So if they expand on it, I hope for a better movie."

And there are those who go to the extremes saying that it was horrible or that it was great. I think the truth lies in between: it had good sides and bad sides. The first 10 minutes of the story were great. Portraying the orcs in a human-ish light is a really interesting idea and it worked throughout the entire movie. But, in contrast and as an irony, the humans were like robots. The way they were saying the lines was more like a child reading a sentence in a classroom. You could't feel that they meant what they were saying. And it wasn't entirely the actors fault. The entire script was lacking: fast paced and trying to hard to make the orcs more alive than the humans. There is a lack of character development in a sense that we can't even empathize with the dead of certain characters because we didn't see them enough throughout the movie. I haven't seen the relationship between Lothar and its son developed more than a few frames so i couldn't feel the connection between them. The same between Lothar and king Llane. Speaking of Llane Wrynn: Dominic Cooper does a great job in Preacher, but did horrible in Warcraft. Too many characters and too much story (part of it written in a bad way) in such a short time (2 hours) would inevitable hurt the movie. Maybe if they had allocated 3 or 4 hours, the story would had a slower pace and the characters would had enough time to build the connections between them. On the bright side of it, the cgi was amazing and the jokes made the entire room laugh. As for the filming frames i think could have been better. Some of them are great (like Lothar jumping from a high place and the griffon catching him or the fight with the golem) but other frames could be way better so they would reach that epic feeling that i (and many other persons) expected. In conclusion, Warcraft movie was a somewhat enjoyable experience, especially if you see it with your friends and for the first time, but it didn't reached its potential. Perhaps the second one will repair this or, maybe it would be better to do a series out of it (though this will probably not happen due to the high cost...but seeing Game of Thrones gives me hope) or reboot it. PS: I really wanted to not compare this movie with The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but i can't help it. I saw the trilogy, the extended one (around 12 hours in total), more than 10 times and i can still watch it again. It's a great trilogy and i expected Warcraft to be if not the same, then bigger and more epic. I watched Warcraft once and i don't feel like watching it again."
" Good experience
",0.4404,0.8988,2017-07-08 00:00:00,8,I liked it a lot as a fan of Blizzard games especially World of Warcraft. It had some really good parts. Sometimes the animation of orcs wasn't that natural as one would think. Cant wait for next films. Every fan should see for sure. A lot of sentimental hogwash about fathers and sons heading off to war. Large scale battles and magical pyrotechnics are nice supplements but the absence of well-formed characters and a meaningful narrative render such pretty things moot.
" This movie had great reviews here. Why?
",0.6249,0.9529,2017-06-30 00:00:00,3,"As usual one needs to only look into the bad reviews written by sharp people. Because those positive-yay-reviews seem to be written by small retarded children, on crack.I must tell you how i got to this conclusion. Background I was watching this movie with my daughter, age 10. She has highly evolved EQ. And together we watched this movie and another day also an old goodie from the 90 ties - Dances with wolves. After we watched both and had some days contemplation she said clearly - Dances with wolves was sooooo much better than Warcraft movie. And she is a Warcraft III TFT fangirl. I was amazed over the fact that she had gotten my perception without me influencing her. This movie was sooo much worse than an epic movie.Now to the point Blizzards most successful game in the Warcraft series is Warcraft III TFT. Its epic, and it contains epic cinematics. And actually much better acting by the CGI actors, then the evolved CGI-actors of this movie. The cinematic clips are available on YouTube.Moon 2009 is up amongst my favorite movies (Duncan Jones) so what could go wrong with Warcraft 3? Well about everything.The first scenes of the orcs are humans. wtf? The orcs laugh and have humor and one would think that they actually are humans. Have the producers even touched the games? Orcs are savages and brutes, the are not humans, they don't joke around. So even the first orc scene was a horrid face palm. I understand to some degree that the producers wanted to make the orcs likable, but with this behavior its not orcs anymore. Its like putting a wolf in costume making him drive a Volvo and putting this into a nature documentary. Thus with this movie a completely new human orc like-race subspecies has been created. Halleluja.The rest of this movie is as bad as the beginning. Predictability is something i despise. After first 15 minutes the whole plot for this first part of Warcraft was 100 % accurately predicted. The acting was horrid, no chemistry between the actors, everything rushed, no depth, on Prozac, Anduin Lothar lost his only child - a whiskey later and some encouraging words and off we go to war again with a smile. Cheap like a Bangkok prostitute. Probably cheaper nowadays.Also Dominic Cooper as king, really. Really are you serious? Total horrid experience. ""Yeah just take my life"", ""im glad to sacrifice myself although i have kids and wife at home"" - must be the Prozac.Also it really felt like a ""beginning"", like you bought the ticket and got to see 10 minutes of the the really shitty movie.The positives Well the CGI at times was satisfactory, some elements like the mage-spells were powerfully and elegantly performed for instance when Medivh protected the warrior band.In summary i expected way better."
" A bit of a mess ...
",-0.3612,0.9966,2017-06-19 00:00:00,4,"I really wanted to like this movie, having been a fan of the games a few years back, but this movie really missed the mark. In my remarks, I will discuss key elements of the plot, which is why I gave it a Spoiler Alert. If you don't want to know certain elements of the story, then don't read any further. The big problem with this movie is the storyline, which moves far too fast, and tries to encompass far too much. We end up getting little glimpses of a lot of characters, but don't get to know any of them. The character of Garona (played by Paula Patton) is a good example. We are introduced to Garona fairly early in the movie, and realize she is ""half-orc"". (It's the green skin and the fangs that give it away.) She seems like she would have been a great character to revolve the story around, yet we learn next to nothing about her. Who were her parents? Her mother, she said, was put to death, but who was her father? How did she end up being tugged along in chains beside the orc hoard, and why was she there at all. Why drag along a half-orc slave girl when you are attacking a new world? Was it her language abilities? We were never told, so can only surmise. Then Garona falls into the hands of the human leadership, who suddenly treat her like a long lost friend. They trust her so completely that she gets to wander alone freely throughout the castle, even down to the dungeons to chat with Anduin. At the end of the movie, she becomes paired with the king in the final battle. She vows to Anduin that she will ""protect the king"", yet we are never told why the king would rely on her protection in the first place. In a matter of days, and the timeline of this movie encompasses no more then that, Garona goes from a slave girl on a completely different world, to suddenly becoming a close confidant of the royalty of the kingdom. They never show us how this sudden relationship growth takes place, or why she would feel such loyalty and affection for a King that she just met. The movie shows us little snippets that suggests that there is a budding romance forming between Anduin and Garona, but leaves that hanging as well, with nothing being resolved. Anduin, for his part, seems attracted to Garona, but again, he never really tells her. Just a lot of staring and mumbling on his part. In the end, Garona remains a complete enigma, which prevents the audience from feeling any kind of attachment to her. So many elements of this movie are just thrown at the audience, who are simply expected to suddenly grasp the significance of characters and situations. Ben Foster's character, Medivh, is thrown at us with the explanation that he is ""The Guardian"". We don't know what or who the Guardian is, and it is never explained, so there is a disconnect. Then there is the young magician, Khadgar, played unconvincingly by Ben Schnetzer. We don't know anything about his origins except that he ran away from some school that we have to assume is for mages. Assume, again, because we are frustratingly not told anything. The movie drops these characters in our laps and then just moves on. The Lord of the Rings demonstrated how to introduce an ensemble cast so that the audience would identify with the various characters, and care what happens to them. All of that is missing from Warcraft: The Beginning. This movie just tosses us back and forth between the orcs, the humans, the mages, back to the good orcs, then over to the bad orcs, and then back to the humans once again. Around and around like a merry-go-round, with not one single character being fully developed enough to care about. Positive: Good CG effects. Negative: Pretty much everything else."
" A disappointment to everyone
",-0.5106,0.7894,2017-05-24 00:00:00,6,"It's sad when the creators really want to make the fans happy: you can see it on the well written plot and on the many shout-outs to the whole lore (the war theater map, the weapons, the sheep spell...), and yet you make such a half-assed attempt that neither fans nor unrelated moviegoers can be satisfied.It's sad when fantasy movies are all about visuals, and yet this movie provides Sci-fi Channel flicks-tier visual effects: poor coordination between the CG animated orcs and the human stunts, gaudy colors that could have been matted except that the producers didn't want to disappoint fans (and I really appreciate the thought, if that was the reason), the armor looks so uncomfortable and cosplay-ish that any non- fan laughs and scoffs at them...It's sad when critics say that the orcs were better performers than the humans. And it's true: the actors seemed very dispassionate and unconvinced, like this was a direct-to-DVD movie instead of a blockbuster with billions spent on it. Might as well just've made it an animated film since the (painfully obvious CGI) orcs had more life and passion in them than Travis Fimmel and Ben Foster did.So overall watching this movie made me sad, for even though there was a blatant and offensive sequel hook in the end, there might not be a sequel for this movie. None of the conflicts left unsolved will be put together in a next episode of this adventure. And there is no need for it. This movie felt like one of those toy-introducing TV productions: there is resolution... inside the games. I should go play some."
" Fits the game, is fun to watch!
",0.5562,0.9939,2017-05-20 00:00:00,10,"As an avid WOW player (alliance) for me, this movie was gorgeous! I was so excited to see many of the local spots in the game, on both Alli and Horde side! With the new patch updates of the game, it makes you wonder where they can take it next. As in this movie they are battling thing that we're just released in the game. You get to see Paladins, Mages, Orcs, Human Warriors etc. The only character I wish I could have seen would have been a Druid(my main character is a druid). A being that can transform into a Bear, a Cat, A boomkin, or a raven. As well as look human. I am hoping they will create a second movie. It was too fun to watch, so much so, I'm watching it again right now. As I've said, this movie is like watching the game on a larger scale. It's seeing your home base, the way you first see it in the game. It's so vast and large, so many different worlds, that there is no reason they couldn't make a second. I know that at least 300,000 people would pay to see this. Anyone who plays the game, will watch it. And that should be enough at $8 a ticket, to pay for any of the effects used in the movie. Amazing. A masterpiece. So well done and thought out. Love Blizard. Love Legendary Entertainment for picking the film up, for all of us players and non players to enjoy."
" I wanted to like this so much
",0.3612,0.9956,2017-05-15 00:00:00,6,"No, I'm not a die-hard 'Warcraft' fan on the computer games this film is based on. However, I am a huge fan of its writer/director Duncan Jones (and of course his late/great father, David Bowie). If you're a fan of sci-fi then you really should check out Jones' first two films: 'Moon' and 'Source Code.' They're a great example of what can be done on a smaller budget with a decent script. Therefore, my hopes were high when I saw the amount of money and resources being poured into 'Warcraft: The Beginning.' However, as many who have studied film since the mid-nineties will know films based on computer games rarely work out.If you have no idea what 'Warcraft' is (and my knowledge is based on playing 'Warcraft II' on the PC many years ago and that hilarious 'South Park' episode that rips into it) then it's kind of like 'Lord of the Rings' i.e. a medieval-type world and an ongoing war between humans and Orcs. Now, I mention 'Lord of the Rings' not just because of the (loose) plot similarities, but also because the trilogy is currently around fifteen years old and dealt with battles between green-skinned Orcs and humans. Therefore, you may think that the special effects will also be fifteen years more advanced that what we've seen before. Not in my opinion. This was my first major gripe with the film – the CGI. It just didn't look real. The dwarfs and elves looked almost comical and the Orcs were basically so blatantly made with computers it took me right out of the story. Unfortunately, the costumes weren't an awful lot better (and these weren't even made with computers!) – they looked like what you'd see at a cosplay event and were way too clean without the rugged 'battle-worn' look that's been displayed in Lord of the Rings.Then we have the plot. Yes, it could simply be described as 'Orcs vs humans,' but they at least try and mix it up a little with some good Orcs and some bad humans. However, the characters are so one-dimensional that the baddies (or either species) simply come off as cartoonish (and doubly cartoonish if they're already drawn on computers and look like a cartoon anyway!). There's a plot in there that kind of reminded me of 'Avatar' (for some reason) about inter-species relationships and working together to save both races.The action was okay. Yes, there are battles, but nothing that Lord of the Rings hasn't done before. All in all this film feels like painting by numbers. It's not terrible, but it probably could have been a lot better. I could imagine a young boy (most likely) who hasn't seen many films being totally blown away by this and loving it (and then going out and buying all the toys afterwards!). However, I'm just too jaded and have seen all this before. Maybe I should be more forgiving when it comes to films like this. I guess it's aimed at children rather than me. But, love it, hate it or – like me – be kind of indifferent to it, I still have faith in Duncan Jones that he'll come back with another awesome film."

Another reason I can't believe I rated it a 7. The film is so cliché it hurts. It was the story about the orcs that made it worthwhile. Maybe the orcs added a third star.And there you have it. 7 stars and me, all astonished and really looking forward to a sequel."

The tusks were quite simply beyond idiotic- how did these things drink a glass of water?

It is truly a shame because I suspect many people did not go to see it because they thought it was just another video game movie. This movie truly does deserve a sequel and they did a great job setting it up for 1. When so many other movies leave a lame setup comma Warcraft did not do this.I wish that I had seen this in the theater instead of renting it. The initial setup is intricate and take some time but I didn't find it boring at all like many other movies. I truly think that this this is well worth a watch. Anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre is likely to enjoy this movie."
" Well made....but not perfect
",-0.2259,-0.781,2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"Saw the Movie with low expectations. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's a good fantasy Movie, one which I will return to with in a similar fashion as how I return to movies like ""Legend"". No dragons, but the orcs and the depiction of magic is splendid.From an artistic Point of view I salute the director, Duncan Jones, for making a Movie with some unexpected plot lines and developments. Important characters meets a bitter end in a much higher degree than usual. The shades of good/evil is fresh. Not all orcs are flat and evil, not even those that are evil. Not all humans are perfect and good. Some are evil, but not with a purely evil intent.If I were to mention some negatives, I would add the obvious CGI, very visible even in things that ought not to be CGI.The biggest flaw of the Movie is its obvious franchise-building purpose. The ending is not bad, no more Deaths were necessary - the Death of the main baddie would have been a problem even because that would have put the horde in a peculiar Place. But Gul'Dan should have made some additional move; as would Garona need. As it ends it's a bit too open.So, if the Movie hadn't been titled ""the beginning""; it would have been better."

There they encounter humans, resulting in a titanic struggle.Conventional, dull action-fantasy drama. A basic linear plot, filled with sword-and-sorcery action scenes and expensive graphics. Characters have no depth, limiting the audience engagement, and the movie feels much like any other other fantasy movie, that is, much style, little substance. Decent cast - Travis Fimmel (of Vikings fame), Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper - but wasted on this empty movie. Considering the wooden acting required for this, I don't think this is going to help their CVs...Saddest thing about this movie is that it is directed by Duncan Jones (David Bowie's son). After a great debut with Moon and a decent follow-up with Source Code, he now resorts to directing this crap. The money must have been really good because he certainly wasn't doing it for the awards or critical acclaim..."

The film adaptation boasts great special effects which concerns Orcs escaping their dying world and invade the world of Azeroth. The human inhabitants of Azeroth try to stop them.The trouble is that the Lord of the Rings made this film more exciting and involving. I could not really get into this film despite the interesting opening and immersive world created by director Duncan Jones. The film just gets bogged down making it boring and derivative. At least Ben Foster stands out, many of the other actors just come across as humdrum even Paula Patton in what should had been an interesting role as the green-skinned Garona Halforcen."

I've played the game for years loved the game and the lore and the film lived up to every expectation. Story is epic and fits in with the most part to lore. Independently you've not played the game and aren't a bit of a WoW geek its a highly enjoyable action film with a great story line, excellent characters and wonderful effects.

I didn't play World Of Warcraft yet but after seeing the movie I'm tending to do so if I have to be honest. If the game has the same story and good graphics as the movie then I will be sold. The story in Warcraft is what you expect from a good fantasy movie. All ingredients are there, like Dwarfs, Orcs, half breeds, magicians and so on. The CGI's are great and now I wished I saw it in the theater instead of my big television screen. The cast is good as well. There's clearly going to be more of them and I will for sure watch them.

" A good fantasy movie, a bad video game movie
",-0.1531,-0.9545,2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"The day it premiered, me not being a wow fan or anything, i went and watched it, a mere fantasy lover who just couldn't resist not coming in contact with something new and promising. Hands down, even if i didn't know anything from this lore, through the movie i couldn't hold a grin all over my face. I don't know why maybe cause i was seeing before me a fantasy world well established. A world that probably deserved it. I left the cinema over-excited. I started playing the game, and more importantly i started reading the novels.First come the Rise of the Horde(RoH), describing the durotan's life, gul'dan's rise to power, the fall of draenor etc. Second would be the Last Guardian(TLG) establishing Kadhagar, Garona, Medivh and Lothar. The third one, Tides of Darkness takes place after the death of Llane and the fall of Storwind, so the movie should sit between novels 2 and 3. And it is between those that i decided to rewatch the movie, now more experienced in the World of Warcraft.To my sadness, i was disappointed. My once 8.5/10 rating fell to 5.5. Althouth the CGI was again THRILLING, the story was honestly RAPED. Reading TLG i noticed that the movie i had watched months ago, had changed some, but damn after rewatching it, i just couldn't stand it. There were some huge changes that honestly served no reason! For example why on earth Stormwind didn't fall? or why did the alliance exist already when it should not? why Orgrim was a Frostwolf? why Lothar's character was so damn wrong?? I hated movie-Lothar! I understand that the movie being made for non wow fans too, should be changed a bit, but come on... Video game movies should be more close to the lore! Even more than book-only fandoms! And me saying that, i am twice a reader than a gamer! For one, if they couldn't make a proper movie of the coming of the horde to azeroth then they could very well start from RoH story. It has the content to support a great fantasy movie. Works that end up lesser than they should, are disappointing."

It's not based on World of Warcraft, but on other series.As with comic book adaptations and other video game adaptions there are some slight deviations, but nothing too extreme.The CGI and motion capture for this film and some of the actual sets were good, not great. To me CGI and green screen should be an excuse to abandon live sets and locations. The film has characters similar to that of Lords of the Rings but not the same quality on the all around.Ruth Negga and Paula Patton were great, especially Paula Patton. She needs to do more action films. I'm sorry but nothing beat traditional make-up and watching the actual actor versus motion capture. The motion capture was good in this and was needed for the Orcs. I'm just really glad a decision was made to include Paula Patton and put her in make up, instead of turning her into another motion capture character.Speaking of make up, the costuming was awesome in this. Especially Dominic Cooper who played King Llane Wrynn. His battle armor was incredible.Great fight sequences and a decent story-line. Again, nothing great. I do wish this film was lighter on the gore. I get it's based on a game and the film is meant to emulate the game play but I wish there was less gore.I'm glad the director made changes to the script. The film did have balance between the Orc clans and the humans characters. Unfortunately I can't give this a high rating and certainly can't agree that the video game film curse is over. The deviations were slight but did seem necessary at all and the film as a whole was good not great.I still did enjoy watching this film."

" Surprisingly Good
",0.6249,0.9906,2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"It's hard to get video game movies right, and we all know how nauseating they can be when they're done badly. I really wasn't expecting much going into this - a movie about World of Warcraft? ""How good could that be"" I thought, and perhaps that bit of initial trepidation was just what I needed to enjoy it, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well done this movie was. I don't know how interesting the movie would be if you've never dabbled in World of Warcraft, but having played some myself, it was pretty interesting. If you have played it, you'll probably be familiar with how little the plot really matters when you play. I personally barely ever even read the quest descriptions. I think most people miss a lot of the lore for that reason. That's what was most interesting about this movie for me - I never really thought about the mythos of the world before, and I never really realized how deep the lore is. It was also pretty fun to see the game environments, the cities and locations, represented in a real world way. Very strange, but fun. All that being said, this is still a movie you need to take with a grain of salt. It's still a pretty silly thing to make a movie out of, and you can't expect it to be the best movie you've ever seen. What you see is what you get with this movie. It's a dumb action movie and it has all the trappings of that genre. Trappings such as forced romance between two characters who just met, characters who are from opposite sides of a war, characters who start out being enemies. In this movie that forced romance is between Garona and Lothar, and it's probably the weakest plot point in the movie. It feels very forced and awkward and just doesn't work very well. It's very clear that it's only there in order to check the romance box on their list of action tropes. It's a shame that Hollywood thinks this is such a necessary ingredient, but I suppose we can't really expect a World of Warcraft to push the boundaries. Overall, it's a pretty decent watch, especially if you've played WoW at all. It's pretty predictable and a bit campy at points, but decent nonetheless. It's basically exactly what you expect it to be. Nothing more, nothing less."

And as an art form, cinema is very young compared to other art forms, it's been around for about only a century. And just like cinema, technology as we know; like electricity, cars, telephones has been around for about a century. Then we have video games now, even younger than any other art form(that i know of). We live in a different world now. Everyday, we wake up to a different world. The information is very easy to access for almost everybody. If a question pops into my head, at 2:00 am at night, i don't even have to wait for the morning to go to a library. Google, Wikipedia is on my finger tips anytime, anywhere i like. If I need more, i can buy an e-book online, and read it on my computer screen or on my phone. And Art is both directly and indirectly affected by these technological changes. A film could be based on a novel that was published 200 years ago, for example Pride & Prejudice (2005), but today, it can also be based on a video game. There has been many films, panned by the critics when they were first released. Because they were ahead of their time. I'm not saying Warcraft is a groundbreaking masterpiece, but it's a solid story. And video games, as an art form, are too young for general audience(and critics) to appreciate. This film holds a 20% score by top critics on Rotten Tomatoes. I can totally understand a 50 year-old newspaper critic getting nothing out of this film. I'm not blaming them but this film doesn't deserve such low score. Again, i'm not saying it's a masterpiece. But if it were a lowest common denominator superhero film with a weaker story and plot, it would have gotten a higher score by the same critics.Video games have great potential to enrich the cinema and art in general with their original ideas and stories. Would you rather watch another hackneyed story based on religion, comic books, classics or would you rather watch an original idea, story? Would you rather watch another remake of spiderman or would you rather watch a story based on Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim?"
" Not to be compared to LOTR!
",0.0,0.9779,2017-02-10 00:00:00,5,"This flick is all flash no substance at all, hardly even a scene of tolerable acting. I did not play the current series of games but did play Warcraft of which this has not to do with. First of your on planet x.. not humans not earth though they say both plenty. Seconds orcs are more like ogres but some can think a little. This seems to be ""loosely"" based on WOW the MMO and maybe written by someone who knows nothing of fantasy. So that's the bad as for good there is some if you can get past the action movie story the fights are pretty good. If you like magic and the FX used to portray it that is clearly where the budget went. DO NOT compare to any LOTR movie the old cartoons destroy this, even the DnD fantasy movies are better save for CGI. Bottom line its good for one watching nothing more."
" Pretty fun
",0.7579,0.9542,2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"For an adaptation of a popular game, this is pretty fun. It tries to do both sides justice (good and bad are a fine line, when you get both perspectives), which may anger a couple of people, but is a nice touch. I have only played the original Warcraft games and never got around to the World of Warcraft one. Which on one hand is a good thing of course, considering how much time I would have been online playing.So I can't really compare what is being taken from the game and what they left out (heard some people complaining about missing characters). But you can imagine that a movie can not hold everything in it. Maybe there are (or were?) plans to include some things in a sequel. I doubt there will be one, considering the Box Office this made (or rather didn't make). Still if you like Fantasy and Science Fiction, you could do a lot worse. This is really fun"
" No Craftiness
",-0.296,-0.0671,2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"I don't know anything about Warcraft except that it's a game. I was going into this as a blank slate: tell me your story, show me your movie and I have no biases to start.Ala LOTR and Game of Thrones there is a kingdom with many districts/outposts, etc. Orcs, from a separate world altogether, have found a portal into the world of humans, dwarfs and other beings. These Orcs have only conquering on their minds and the humans must stop them to protect their world.The story is pretty good, nothing groundbreaking. I had no problem with it for the most part but there were some definite inconsistencies that I found annoying. The CGI was solid (it was a major undertaking considering all of the Orcs were CGI) and there were some nice battle scenes. Beyond that, there's not much to say about it. They tried to go for some depth but it fell very flat. In fact, it came of as sloppy and trite. I think they would have been better off going a less serious route and making it what it was: a battle of humans and Orcs."
" What a waste of time!

I haven't played Warcraft before,but i heard it has a good story.So l went to see it with quite a expectation. But,ugh,it starts promising and soon went straight downward.The story is broken,and the acting is bad.I almost feel asleep during the half!This movie really has destroyed all my hope for the Warcraft series! I can see there's much potential in it,but i don't know what happened and these people simply ruined it!Conclusion: Don't waste your time and money watching this movie.It's not worth it."
" Entertaining, but DVD level stuff.
",0.2382,-0.9813,2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"Warcraft Movie reviewWell for some reason I knew that they would screw up the Warcraft movie, a good story, plenty of money and I just knew they would fail. Part of the problem with these ""Go to film"" adaptations is that the executives who are making the film have no interest in making a good movie, they just want to get the minimum out there to fleece the fans who are going to watch it. Another thing that goes wrong with these films is the ""hand off"", you go from someone who knows and created the thing to someone who doesn't understand or may not even like the franchise. Please save us from the guy who says ""You may know games but I know movies."" :P Some games are almost interactive movies. So where do I start? The Orcs are WAY TO BIG. How are you supposed to fight a war movie, sword and shield, when these things can swat an elite fully armored knight away like a gnat? This is some idiot's idea of trying to make the Orcs seem terrifying. You could have achieved the same thing in a dozen different ways (Bringing in a few Ogre's, spell casters or a lesser worm, for instance) but, no, he had to go the stupid way. Also, the director of Warcraft has no idea how to craft a battle. Trained knights and the best Wizard in the realm walk right into an ambush? Not only that, mostly all the knights get, swatted down without ever putting up a fight. It may be expedient but it's not war craft. Other problems, magic played too much of a central role. Weapons, even magical ones, play a central role in WoW, here we see a big sword that might not even be magical. Seriously, Star Wars, launches a whole genre off of bad ass sword fights and these guys decide to skip it. The biggest problem by far was the concept ""The beginning"". Why start out small when you could go big? Really big. When you get your chance up at bat, you don't just say ""This is a prequel."", a warm up for the real thing.,you swing for the bleachers. With very little effort they could have presented the conflict as world wide, with a host of Orcs and other things pouring through the portal and an alliance of Men, Dwarfs and Elves joining together to defeat them. Instead of having an Army dive in to prevent the invasion, you could have had a desperate charge to the portal to end it.Entertaining? Yes, if you like the genre. Good? Not very. About a 7.5 out of 10. Could have been much better."
" Great film Blizzard
",0.6249,0.9495,2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Really enjoyed this movie, please don't listen to others who thinks the opposite cause everything they claim to be is not as such! The plot is really good, the acting is nice too, the effects that are used adds to the experience, and its very entertaining. If you liked lord of the rings and hobbits, its in the same veins. Lots of magic tricks,the monsters are really well done, lots of different breeds of people and monsters, beautiful sceneries.Its has all the stuff that makes a good movie, but it is also original in some way, I cant really mention any of these cause it might sploiled the experience when looking at the film. All in all you should check it out!Cant wait for the sequel."
" It is exactly how it should be.
",0.0,0.7969,2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"Do not get me wrong, the magic is done brilliantly, the Orcs are as fearsome as they are in the the games everything about it oozes greatness. Granted, I feel there are better more interesting stories that can be told in regards to the Warcraft Universe Arthas, Illadin, Kel'Thelas so on etc I think a wider part of the Audience cannot connect with Orc's, They are none human and so on.That being said it is necessary for the story to be told from the beginning so that the wider audience can understand. I would be shocked and utterly disappointed if many more movies are not mate.The acting in my opinion was good, the visual aspect of the movie was breath taking and my friends who don't play or know a clue about the Warcraft Universe loved it.Look, its not my favourite part of the universe but Neither was ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" to any LOTR fan so this will only get better with sequels... as did LOTR when it got to the Two Towers and Return of the King.What saddens me the most is people take advice from 40 year old critics who still live in their parents basements."
" An interesting adaptation although not everyone will follow
",0.4019,0.9982,2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Video game movies to this day are still struggling to get their transition correct from interactive to submissive entertainment. Unfortunately there's a disconnect between the fans of the movies and the fans of video games. This is due to multiple factors; lack of knowledge of the game, lack of people who have played the game and the lack of appreciation for the game. Things seemed to be on the up and up though for 2016 when some very different people got involved with the production of various video game movies. For Blizzard's popular Warcraft game, the adaptation of it to the big screen was under development for several years. So many times was it delayed for numerous reasons. But after long periods of waiting devoted fans were finally able to see their favorite gaming platform on the big screen. Sadly the response was about as predictable as expected. Critics were unimpressed and it barely made back its budget. On the other hand, majority fans were vastly grateful for the presentation. For non-video game fans though it's somewhat a mixed bag.The positive to the film is its director and writer pair. Writing the script was Charles Leavitt and Duncan Jones. Leavitt was known for penning Blood Diamond (2006) and The Express (2008). Duncan Jones on the other hand directed Moon (2009), Source Code (2011) and is also an avid World of Warcraft gamer. With that said, it only suits that Jones directs this film. The story follows the clash of two worlds, the humans and the Orcs. The Orcs' world is dying and the only way they can survive is by taking over a new one, that being the humans. In the human world, King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) leads the way with Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). Overseeing them is sorcerer Medivh (Ben Foster) and his apprentice Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) as protectors of the human world. Leading the Orcs is Gul'Dan (Daniel Wu), who has powers that only work by draining the life force of other living things. Following him are Durotan (Toby Kebbell), Orgrim (Robert Kazinsky), Blackhand (Clancy Brown) and half-breed Garona (Paula Patton).As a start-off point to a beginning franchise, the story isn't too hard to follow. The problem in the script are because of a couple things. Since this is based on a video game, it is understood that the filmmakers will want to give fan service to its passionate gamers. Yet there are times where special nods to the in-game achievements outnumber the explanations to what is going on within certain scenes. There's no problem with giving the fans what they enjoy. However for people not familiar with the game, this can be confusing because they will not be familiar as to why particular events happen. This is one of the issues with video game movies. Gamers would rather play the game than watch and non-gamers may not understand why things happen for a distinct reason. Also there are occasional motivation flip-flops attributed to a couple of characters. This may add to the bewilderment of the viewer because of their non-gamer unfamiliarity. Even with this though, the characters are likable and are sympathetic due to their situations.Out of all actors, the best of them is Toby Kebbell as Durotan. Kebbell plays his role with strength and feeling. Durotan's arc is a challenge to watch because of how conflicted he is. Durotan knows Gul'Dan isn't a great Orc but he's the only one powerful enough to lead them to survive. It's easy to see as to why this could cause internal friction. For the humans, Lothar is the more interesting of the bunch. He's had a career in the army for a while and his skills are valuable. For action, the sequences are entertaining to watch. For a PG-13 rating, some of the violence is actually pretty brutal. The humans use weapons that belong in the dark ages such as swords and shields. The Orcs use giant over sized workman tools like axes and sledge hammers. Not even the horses and other animals are safe in the battle scenes. Individuals are stabbed, thrown and even de limbed. Effects wise, the transformation of the characters and world are done expertly well. Using motion-capture effects, the half of the cast look nothing like themselves under the Orc makeup.With technology on the rise, motion-capture has come a long way in making creatures more and more realistic. Only a couple actors can be seen under the effects. Everyone else practically disappears and that's great. The camera-work by Simon Duggan is another credible component. Unfortunately it's not clear as to what scenes actually contained real life terrain. Nevertheless the backgrounds to each scene are well constructed. Duggan is known for filming other big CGI budget films like I, Robot (2004), The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), Killer Elite (2011) and The Great Gatsby (2013). All of which had acceptable camera-work. Music wise Ramin Djawadi composed the film score. From an audible perspective the score is engaging and has an organic sound. The makeup of it sounds like that of heavy strings and horns. This falls somewhat in line with Djawadi's past works although some have varied. Unfortunately the tracks do not have a reoccurring main theme but the tunes do match their respective scene. It has its moments even to enjoy.Storytelling wise, the script has motive flip-flops and non familiar fans may not understand certain events that happen. However the overall plot is fairly simplistic and the characters are sympathetic. The visual effects, cinematography and music are also well produced."
" Sad excuse for another sad fantasy movie
",-0.7096,0.549,2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"I loved the previews, hyped and ready to see a great movie.... Sadly mistaken. I loved the beginning, sweet and action at the same time then....FLY away, rush to another bunch of characters, and kill every character that I was starting to like. A wasted romance, stupid deaths and why.... SpoilerWhy kill Durotan?! I loved him and learning about him. His part in the movie was sadly short and I wanted more. Also his son...what will happen?! The plot was not tied at the end, and I will admit if a sequel comes...I will ignore it."
" Intense, captivating, enThralling! (see what I did there?)
",0.1511,0.9756,2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"I went into this with very little expectations (the last movie I saw being Assassin's Creed, this is understandable). And WoW, oh Wow, (okay, I know, I should stop). I loved this. I didn't expect it to be so captivating, but the CG and cinematography! As it pulled me in, what struck me was how they cinematography was positioned to depict actual game-play. Another similarity to the games, was how as the story is being played out, the viewer sees both sides of the war and the internal debate is never answered as to who wins or more importantly, who do we want to win. Your heart ends up beating for both sides. All talk of how this does justice to the games aside, I think even non players can watch this, it is thoroughly enjoyable and it just does not quit. I had no idea about the background of this story however, having played only Reign of Chaos and Frozen Throne, but despite that, I absolutely enjoyed this! I cant wait to see what Blizzard releases next in this franchise! Loved the cast: Dominic Cooper, Travis Fimmel. Ben Schnetzer as was likable as Khadgar. Maybe even Arthas will make an appearance next time?"
" If you love Warcraft and World of Warcraft you will love this movie !
",0.8655,0.9949,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"If you love Warcraft (1,2 and 3) and World of Warcraft you will love this movie ! The story takes most from the Warcraft games and not so much from the MMO.If you have never played either of the games you will probably not ""love"" the movie, but it has a good standalone story, awesome effects and great acting.The story follows a nice flow, with a introduction into the characters and the world that we are introduced to. The effects in this movie are pretty good, they are not like the trailers for the games like WoW and other Blizzard games, but it's pretty damn close. It is the best live action ""monsters"" i have seen ever in any full length movie. Considering that the Blizzard trailers take about a year to make and those are just a couple of minutes long, it would be unfair to expect a full length movie to have the same effects.I feel like this is a nice first movie, i would love to see a sequel and how the story will continues on.I do think the movie struggles a little if you don't know about the games or the story from the books :) I have not personally read the books from WoW but i have read bits and pieces. And the story is amazing.I give this movie an 8/10."
" Well Crafted War
",-0.4215,0.9818,2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"I have played video games where while watching the cut scenes I thought 'This would make a great movie'. That is what this movie is. It is a well made video game with the gameplay removed.The story follows the orcs, whose home world is dying. To survive, they have decided to take over another world, the realm of the humans. The human world is a more peaceful place, but able to defend itself. And so there is war.The story is simple, with a few twists. The acting is decent. What makes the movie stick out is the action and CG. The fighting is awesome, the magic is beautiful. They did a fantastic job of bringing the world alive. Overall it is not worth watching for all people. But if you have ever thought a bunch of video game cut scenes would make a good movie, you will likely enjoy this one."
" Best movie of 2016
",0.6369,0.9888,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"I was reluctant to watch the movie but once I watched I was mesmerize... one of the things I liked is that the orcs are not all evil, some are good and some are something in between (good and evil), is not like the Lord of the Ring where all orcs are evil. Men are also not all good, some are good some are evil (or something in between)... in other words it resembles a lit bit real life where you can not say for example all whites are evil, or all blacks are evil... If you like action this movie will provide you with plenty of action, and you can also espect a lot of effects, a world of magic and fantasy... Back to the good and evil, there is a character that changes sides more than once, the first time because she kinda realize that she is fighting for the wrong side, and she goes back to the wrong side as a move to eventually find peace for both men and orc... there is also dwarfs, and elfs on the movie, but they don't play a very big role on the movie... for me is better than the lord of the rings, and made look for more movies about orcs and humans.."
