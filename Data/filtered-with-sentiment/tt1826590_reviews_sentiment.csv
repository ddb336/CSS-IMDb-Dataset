" Painful to watch remake
",-0.4404,0.9098,2020-12-25 00:00:00,3,"If you liked the original,you'll have a hard with this remake. For me the original 1986 version is special because of where I was in my life how it related to me personally. This remake was sloppy and carelessly made because they threw in the lines from the original here and there with no motivation than it was in the original script. The characters relation to each was completely off, in the original the focus was on Danny&Debbie, Bernie and Joan were side supporting characters that didn't like eachother and made comic sideline
The whole chemistry,blocking and flow of the original story is not there,Iam also very annoyed with Kevin Hart which needs all the attention all the time and felt was trying material doing this movie
In the remake there is a scene Danny and Derbie are watching the original film together,isn't it wierd that they then used the same lines in that film in thier life?! sometimes even the wrong character or opposite character said the lines of thier partner
Just watch the original"
" I wasn't sure but wow... I feel different than before.

I love how well it's made, story writing is impeccable and acting is superb. Really well known actors, no drama that isn't unnecessary. At the end of the day, it's about what makes you happy and who makes you happy. Regardless of how much crap you have to go through. I don't normally say this, but this is definitely a favourite of mine. I will be watching it for years to come. Sooo good."
" Pretty good light hearted comedy
",0.8225,0.9858,2020-08-01 00:00:00,6,The film about last nite was surprisingly good bit cheesy In places but I throughly enjoyed it. Kevin Hart and Michael Early are just brilliant at playing the roles. A romantic American comedy that will make u feel good. Just a nice easygoing film to watch.

" Perfect...
",0.0,0.9784,2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"Aim... Ownt ... so cute ... the girls both represent me in their contradictions, peculiarities, extravagances and inconsistencies, I love it... Very good, engaging, captivating, contemporary... It was so cute and exciting, there's no news, clich√© and water with sugar, but this realistic essential touches the heart deeply, especially of lovers, which is not my case, but it touched deep ... Fun, packed by a wonderful soundtrack ..."
" One of the worst find ever
",-0.6249,-0.4318,2019-10-19 00:00:00,1,"Terrible film. The plot, the acting just everything. I normally like Kevin Hart films. Not sure what happened here. Immediately after watching the film I realised I couldn't remember any of the lead character names!"
" my notes
",0.0,0.9106,2019-06-25 00:00:00,7,Extremely funny with a good love story. Was never bored but some of the love parts were chick flick y. No corny jokes tho. and the relationship between kevin hart and regina hall was hysterical (2 viewings)
" Fueled by great chemistry
",0.6249,0.9783,2019-06-04 00:00:00,7,"About last night is an R-rated romantic comedy, released on Valentine's Day of 2014 and was a success at the box office due to that release and it not being a larger budgeted film. This film works due to the great cast having chemistry with one another and that the story lines did a sense of realism.We see many rom-coms with feels of very fairytale-ish and over the top settings, where as in this film, there was a bit more sense of reality and it was stemmed from the writing, dialogue and overall chemistry of its leads. Also a good mix of R-rated content with its comedy and drama.A lot of the criticism seems to come from the fact that this a remake, and of course with remakes, people always whine and compare the remake to the original material and base how good a film is compared to that original. Having not seen the original, and basing this film on its standalone merit, it is worth the watch."
" a new take on the one night stand
",0.0,0.8744,2018-09-16 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you just because you may intend on a one night stand doesn't mean there can't be real relationship potential there. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
