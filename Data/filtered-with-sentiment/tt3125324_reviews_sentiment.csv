" Good screenplay & acting
",0.4404,0.9918,2020-09-14 00:00:00,10,"The story about falling in love with a superstar is probably a recycled material & cliche, but with great screenplay and great acting, this is one of its best. This movie was released in 2014, I watched it in 2020. Even with a 6 year gap, it still is a great movie to me.And the bonus? Lots of great music in it! ;)"
" Great acting
",0.6249,0.7386,2020-08-04 00:00:00,7,"The story isn't too surprising, but the two leads have so much chemistry that it didn't feel cheesy at all. The characters show growth, but in a way that makes it feel real and natural."

" Undeniably cheesy, but leaves an impression
",0.3291,0.9982,2019-05-03 00:00:00,8,"""Beyond the Lights"" starts off strong with Minnie Driver traumatizing her daughter after winning second place at a school talent show competition. Minnie is domineering and ambitious where her daughter is fragile and willing to please. However Minnie's one-track mind brings her daughter overwhelming, but terrible compromising success. After a milestone Billboard top song award Minnie's daughter and client, now going by the name Noni (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw), decides to commit suicide. The older Noni is charming, desirable, and totally out of control of her life. Her bodyguard helps her from the ledge and the two romance.What I've described is the first ten minutes of a two hour film. Does it maintain momentum? Yes. Is it predictable? Yes. Is there flaws? Also yes. But is it a dramatic, glamorous, heartfelt and sweet film? I think so.""Beyond the Lights"" follows the transition of fictional pop singer Noni from sex object to soul singer, but more importantly from an inauthentic musician and person to an authentic one. Unhappy with her cutthroat mother/agent, trashy co-star Kid Culprit and constant paparazzi, she clings onto her honest bodyguard for hope.Their romance has ""The Bodyguard"" feels for sure, but they both read as very modern and this makes up for it. Noni's wardrobe in particular is incredibly fashion forward and up-to-date. Her styling reminds me of Rhianna. Mbatha-Raw as Noni is heartbreaking in her loneliness, but also absolutely believable as unattainable sex fantasy pop star. Her attraction is palpable and it's no wonder Nate Parker as the bodyguard looks smitten.What is less believable though is Parker's bodyguard/cop/upcoming politician arc. His storyline is the weak spot in ""Beyond the Lights."" It's too expedited to feel realistic, especially as Noni's career is shown to have developed over ten years instead of a couple weeks in her bodyguard's case. Parker is fine as Noni's semi-reluctant lover. He is sweet-tempered and hot, and also respectful of Noni. However beyond this Parker lacks the same depth as Mbatha-Raw and also has less to play against. Mbatha-Raw has Minnie Driver for contrast.Minnie Driver delivers a strong performance as selfish but hapless mother and hardened agent. One feels her character is pigeonholed however. She has less chance to show any kind of vulnerability that isn't used against her. Driver plays a good villain, but one feels with her acting chops she ought to have been given more to work with to show her dimension. I felt a bit of missed opportunity there.I liked ""Beyond the Lights."" It had exciting, dynamic moments, but I felt some of the plot resolutions weren't fully earned. This prevents me from giving a higher rating, but I want to recommend ""Beyond the Lights"" as having truly standout aspects, especially in the portrayal by Mbatha-Raw. Although I was underwhelmed by some plot devices I admit ""Beyond the Lights"" did leave me changed. It has made me aware of how pop culture can sometimes mythologize a person while at the same time erasing their soul. It's a scary thought, but ""Beyond the Lights"" takes an honest and caring look, even if the result is cheesy."
" WHY YOU WANNA FLY BLACKBIRD?
",0.0,0.6997,2019-04-13 00:00:00,10,"Noni Jean (Gugu Mbatha-Raw)is a rap/hip-hop singer whose early life is semi-biographical. Her career is controlled by her driver mother (Minnie Driver). She clearly makes her money by being a rapper sex object than through her talents. Disillusioned with life, she attempts a take a dive off a balcony only to be rescued by officer Kazam Nicol which fuels a relationship.Kaz is also being pushed by his father (Danny Glover) into a political career he doesn't really want.The film is a romance which rejects the sexist rapper world in favor of finding your own voice. A little sappy at times and a bit formulaic. Lifetime fans will eat this up.Guide : Brief sex scene. No nudity. 1 F-bomb that I recall."
" Everything ""The Bodyguard"" should have been and wasn't
",0.0,0.9672,2018-11-27 00:00:00,9,"GREAT movie, one of the best recent films I've seen lately. The basic situation is reminiscent of ""The Bodyguard"" -- superstar singer falls in love with the man who saved her life (in this story it's from a suicide attempt) and the two have a touch-and-go relationship -- but this time it's done far, far better. The characters of Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and Kaz (Nate Parker) have real depth and complexity, and writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood brilliantly counterpoints their troubled relationships with their parents. Both Noni's mom (MInnie Driver) and Kaz's dad (Danny Glover) have ambitions for them that aren't always what the kids themselves want, and their struggles to get out of their parental cocoons add weight and drama to what otherwise could have been either a sappy romantic comedy or a depressing melodrama. The ending is a bit weak, but otherwise ""Beyond the Lights"" is a wonderful film, sensitively written, effectively directed and vividly acted. (Who were the idiots at Sony who dumped this project because they didn't think Gugu Mbatha-Raw could play the female lead? She's wonderful!) I caught up with this on a clearance-sale DVD and didn't have much hope for it, but I'm glad I saw it and heartily recommend it to anyone."
" is fame all you are?
",0.4404,0.9149,2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows that you have to be true to yourself. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.

" It's Always About Staying True To Yourself
",0.4215,0.9947,2018-04-08 00:00:00,9,"Beyond the Lights is a wonderful, magical movie, which shows how important is to not loose the right ''track'' in life. Actors- Gugu, Nate were the key to this movie's success, there's no doubt. Their portraying of the main characters couldn't be better. Although it was mostly about ''Kaz's'' and ''Noni's'' relationship, I was more focused on the main protagonist's past during the movie, what made the protagonist into famous, yet, unhappy singer. When I started to watch movie, I saw Noni's cover performance of Simone's ''Blackbird'', which made me realize, how deep this movie is going to be. I wasn't wrong. Her mom, Macy (Minnie Driver), with her only daughter wandering, in the big world, on their own.''Was the journey worth at the end?''- I think it was. It tested not only her mother's mental strength, but Noni's itself as well. The problem of her big journey, probably, was the mother, who tried to do the best for her daughter, yet, she didn't realize, what kind of human she is turning her. Though both, at the end, parted their ways, I still felt that connection, what I felt at the start of the movie- connection of two lost birds, who fought together against the cruel world.At the end, we take wisdom from the movie, what we want the most. I definitely would rate this movie 9/10, because this movie showcased wonderfully such features as love, bravery and searching between what's real, and whatsoever- is not. You can work hard to achieve fame, but finding the real love and your true self takes a lot more. It takes also big courage to say, that you want to live the life like you want to, not like the big crowd, or even your closest relative- your mom."
" A Star Is Born and Her Name is Gugu
",0.0,0.9958,2018-03-29 00:00:00,8,"There's something hypnotic about Gugu Mbatha-Raw's performance as Noni in Beyond the Lights. Her facial expressions are emotive without exaggeration. Subtle, yet powerful. Scared but brave. Maybe it is Gina Prince-Bythewood's direction-she turned a young Sanaa Lathan into a rugged tomboy who seemed every bit as tough, insecure, and compassionate as the moment required. Maybe it is the collaborative skills of Gina and Gugu that make this movie so unique. Whatever it is, it is undoubtedly the performances that carry a relatively basic story of a talented young girl with a tiger mom (played ferociously by Minnie Driver) that drives her to attempt suicide, only to be saved by a local police officer. It is the setup for a tired Cinderella trope, but Beyond the Lights is anything but. Beyond the Lights is as vibrant and refreshing as anything you have ever seen in the romance genre and one of the best films of 2014.Beyond the Lights, stunning cinematography captures the authenticity of the music world without ever feeling overly glitzy and glamorous in a way that makes you envy Noni's existence. Noni inhabits a world that feels as isolated as she feels inside. The shadowy vignette effect of the cinematography gives you the feeling that you are a voyeur in her life and her world only seems to open up when she escapes from the music industry with Kaz (Nate Parker). It is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, so I will not spoil it for anyone who has not seen the film. However, anyone who has, will understand how significant and touching it is to watch Noni reveal her true self to Kaz in their Mexico hideaway. It is this understanding of cinematic language that makes Gina Prince-Bythewood one of the most underappreciated auteurs in cinema. Her films are as visually enchanting as her stories. Beyond the Lights, brilliance comes in those small intimate scenes between Gugu and Nate, and it is here where you see Gugu shine against Parker's occasionally stoic character performance. This critique is not a knock against him, it works for the character of Kaz, but one could only imagine if he was directed to open up a little more, how powerful the film's climax would've been. However, it is this reluctance to go all in on their love that makes it feel authentic. One of my biggest complaints about non-biopic films about musicians is the quality of the songs. Beyond the Lights nails this too. Masterpiece-the opening song after the prologue-feels like any number of confectionary bops that could quickly end up in heavy rotation on your local FM station. You never doubt the that Noni is a star.Beyond the Lights does not follow the traditional path of romance films. While it feels like a Cinderella story, it is really about the rediscovery of a young woman's identity that has been stripped away by everyone around her who wishes to define her. Gina Prince-Bythewood uses Nina Simone's Blackbird as an allegory for Noni's inner pain, and Gugu's doe-eyed performance lights the way into Noni's heart. Beyond the Lights is a beautiful journey into the heart of a character that exists in a coldhearted world of objectification, manipulation, and violence. However, Noni manages to make you care so genuinely for her that you want to pull her out of that world and hold her close until she remembers that love is waiting on her if she only looks inside herself."
" Fabulous
",0.5267,0.8516,2018-03-22 00:00:00,10,Was honored to view this film in a pre-release screening before it hit theaters where I live. Love it! Have sinced watched it two times. I look forward to more films from this team.
" Gugu vs clich√©s
",0.0,0.9806,2017-11-30 00:00:00,4,"Other than gorgeous Gugu, this is a collection of clich√©s strung end to end. All the mandatory scenes are there, including the breakdown, the on-stage embarrassment, the beach montage, the hair removal (normally using scissors but this time removing extensions), and many, many more. The writer must have read the Hollywood Big Book of Clich√©s.I rented this DVD simply because Gugu is in it, and hoped that it would at least be okay. But it's not. It's just pants. I actually skipped through some of the clich√©s without missing a thing.Minnie Driver is pretty good, and it's nice to hear British accents for a change. But it's an afternoon TV chick-flick, not a thriller, blockbuster or art film.I still love Gugu and I forgive her, but I'm going to forget this pile of poo as fast as I can - which will be very easy."
" Surprisingly great movie...
",0.743,0.9729,2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"I wasn't sure what to expect but, this was a really great movie. I've never heard of it before. I was searching for movies to watch that I haven't seen and came across this. I'm glad I decided to watch as I did enjoy it. The storyline was good and kept me intrigued to watch the entire movie. Definitely a must see."
