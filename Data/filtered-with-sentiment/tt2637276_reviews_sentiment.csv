" Disgust to play with feelings
",-0.3612,0.6293,2021-03-27 00:00:00,2,Funny movie until the hospital scene! Cmon?! For what?!
" Is it funny?
",0.4404,0.5667,2021-03-17 00:00:00,5,"I really wanted to laugh, and some scenes really tried to enjoy them but it was a struggle..."
" Good sequel
",0.4404,-0.0231,2021-03-10 00:00:00,8,"It is a very good sequel, it maintains the same kind of environment and jokes as ted 1, but it also has the same bad parts, some jokes are really stupid that you will not laugh at, but is also a good comedy so it delivers the part that the writers and producers promise."
" Very good
",0.4927,0.9955,2021-03-09 00:00:00,8,"Appearing as something unexpected in the cinema, the feature Ted, written, produced and directed by Seth MacFarlane, had a protagonist who was only sympathetic in appearance, since the behavior of the stuffed animal and its owner are politically incorrect in the extreme, something that has remained in its continuation. Ted is an animal that came to life in a tasteless way, as it was the result of a desire of its owner. What no one expected was the behavior he would have in his supposedly adult phase. As in the first film, he swears, smokes marijuana, talks openly about sex and pornography, as well as a series of unconventional behaviors. Speaking of unconventional, the film already begins with Ted's marriage to his (human) girlfriend Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth), and that with all the traditional arrangements like wedding dress, and the like. Well, after getting married, the problems start, not the traditional ones, because the teddy bear starts to have its benefits and legal rights hunted, because it starts to be considered a property, not an ordinary citizen. Thinking about it, he and his owner John (Mark Wahlberg) begin a saga in search of a lawyer who can turn the situation around, which leads them to find the also madman Samantha Jackson (Amanda Seyfried); the latter one that guides the desperate pair in search of the perfect defender for Ted's ""humanization"". As you can imagine, there is a festival of jokes involving a little of everything: sex, drugs, nerdy culture, cinema, famous people and so on, always trying to seek a good laugh in situations that do not depend on making sense. It is certainly something that Deadpool has raised exponentially, although in this Ted 2 there is a greater purpose than revenge, which sounds even more human and sentimental than expected. The cast headed by Wahlberg still has the help of great film and TV personalities, such as Giovanni Ribisi who returns as the villain Donny; Morgan Freeman as the respected lawyer Patrick Meighan; John Carroll Lynch as a Hasbro manager; Lian Neeson as a paranoid customer but who appears to dose a little more acid and clueless MacFarlane humor. The presence of the teddy bear on the scene is not at all sweet, although the appearance still wins the attention of the female audience, as it is an alpha male who makes a point of proving this, and the neat visual effects give an even more impressive tone to the character, the that makes the interactions fantastic. Using the Comic Con fair as the stage for the third act, undoubtedly a genius move (and nerd) by the director and screenwriter, TED 2 bets on the formula that enshrined the original at the box office and still serves as a showcase for fans to identify characters at all times ( cosplayers) at the fair in question, certainly a fact that further expands the result of the fun being undeniable in this great comedy.Film reviewed on March 8 for March 9, 2021."

I went into it with high hopes, like I do with a lot of bad movies, and it was un BEAR able, (I'm sorry, I had to). It was a bad movie, honestly. A couple of the jokes were mildly funny, and the movie didn't make you bored, but most of the jokes and gags were just loathsome. Overall, I didn't like this movie, and I wouldn't recommend it."

" Ted 1 and 2
",0.0,0.9867,2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,Ok I am giving a 8 between the Both Ted's. Seth is a Fantastic Film Comedy Writing Man. It's about a Teddy Bear that's alive. And it is Funny it Smokes Weed. Also Liam Neeson shows up at his Work to buy a box of Trix. And stuffs it in his Jacket after he buys it Lol. Giovanni Ribisi is in both Film's after the Teddy Bear. Then as a Lawyer he gets one of the Best Actors of all times Morgan Freeman. In both Film's he does not get low Actors he gets the Best for his Film's. Oh and the Teddy Bear that is getting Married his Wife is a 10 out of 10. She is so Hot also in that on part they are having a fight in the Kitchen. The Wife pretty much Kicks the Teddy Bears Ass. Throws everything at him. What makes that even Funnier he is wearing a short sleeve t-shirt. You know the One they call the Wife beating T-shirt. What makes that even Funnier that is the Only part he is wearing that T-shirt. Great Films.
" Increasing the F Words dosen't make it funnier.

" Disgusting
",-0.5267,-0.9325,2020-06-26 00:00:00,1,"A sickening, naughty, perverted and infamous film. how the people who watched it were brought up. who allowed this movie to be released? a rude movie. the worst example of the movie."
" Not that great
",-0.5096,0.0536,2020-06-10 00:00:00,6,Movie feels like a extended live action episode of Family Guy. Good acting and a bunch of funny scenes. But nothing that exciting.
" Not bad
",0.431,0.9965,2020-05-25 00:00:00,7,"At times pretty fun, amusing, and silly- Ted 2 is not as good as its predecessor, but it is able to hold itself together just enough to make for a slightly better than average comedy sequel. Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane return in the lead roles of this buddy comedy, and their chemistry again is fantastic. The plot, from what you can follow of it, is all over the place, and it has a hard time figuring what it wants to do throughout the course of its runtime. However, that isn't to say the film isn't funny. It may not be a laugh riot, like the first film, but it has plenty of jokes to keep you satisfied, and just enough to keep you engaged and entertained throughout its nearly 2 hour long run. There are plenty of gags, some of which don't always land, or simply feel random or don't make a lot of sense. The acting is not bad, with some delightful cameos throughout and everyone truly giving it their all despite its juvenile nature. In the end, Ted 2 is by no means a perfect comedy, nor is it a great sequel. What Ted 2 is however, is a fun time that isn't ashamed of what it is, and is just entertaining and humorous enough to provide for a decent watch.
My Rating: 7.5/10"
" Offensive ""comedy"" is easy and lowbrow
",-0.4588,0.9781,2020-05-02 00:00:00,1,"McFarlane has made it all too clear over the years where his opinion on lgbt people lies. Hes moderately talented, but instead of inproving upon that talent, he has instead let attention and fame go to his head, and now hes all about making jokes that reference the 80s and 90s to cash in on cheap nostalgia, and jokes that punch down on people who really dont need it, who are just trying to enjoy things like everyone else. Its one thing to trash people for having certain types of personalities and such, but to send some of the msgs he has sent in his shows and in this movie is just disgusting, and unacceptable. Its not being sensitive to not want to hear jokes about people just because they exist, rather than jokes we can all laugh at together. I hope making the world a little bit of a worse place is worth it Seth."
" mediocre entertainment
",0.4215,0.7814,2020-04-07 00:00:00,4,"The story about a living teddy bear is nonsense, but his behavior and sayings are funny. The first part was a bit better."
" Review of both parts of Ted- By Divyam Saran
",0.0,0.9951,2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"All things considered, a few motion pictures are with the end goal that they are adored by crowds of each age gathering. The film about which I am going to discuss today falls under that class, Ted and Ted 2.
The film rotates around John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) who during his youth days, on the event of Christmas Eve wanted that his teddy springs up and it works out as expected. This film at that point manages the further existence of John as a grown-up, how Ted turns into a necessary piece of his life and how he influences his own life.
This film, as I would see it, doesn't exhaust you and holds you till the end. It is pressed with amusement, sentiment, and some exciting activity as well. Although there are some scenes unsuitable for children, for example, when John and Ted smoke together or there might be some private minutes among Ted and his sweetheart, which gives this film an ""A"" rating yet at the same time I see this film as extremely engaging.
The initial segment, Ted (2012), rotates around the life of John Bennett, his relationship with Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) and how Ted unfavourably influences their relationship.
The subsequent part, Ted (2015), managed the life of Ted and his relationship with his better half Lynn (Jessica Barth). Right now, the film, Ted likewise faces a personality emergency as the American Government will not consider Ted as a typical individual.
Seth MacFarlane has offered a voice to Ted and has likewise coordinated the establishment. His course is excellent remembering that it is his presentation directorial adventure. The screenplay and the story were additionally generally excellent.
And if I say something about dialogues then they are very well written. Be it be dialogues of Ted too and the dialogue delivery is also really very entertaining and impressive.
This was not the first occasion when I saw a film of Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis cooperating. Separately just as together this pair unquestionably functions admirably. I prior saw them in the film Max Payne (2008), where Mark assumes the title job and Mila assumes the job of Mona Sax. I truly regard these individuals as entertainers a great deal.
Seeing a delicate toy come into life is a different encounter for me and I imagine that it would engage all of you as well. Although the film has become very old I think it has not lost its engaging variable.
There are many things which we can learn from every movie and that is the case here too but I would state only one thing which I found out to be the most important. It is based on the priorities set by an individual in his or her life. Priorities are dynamic; they never remain fixed. John should have realized the same point. He should have felt that since he is in his 30s or 40s, Ted should not be his prime priority now. I know Ted is his best friend and they are so-called 'thunder buddies' of each other but they can maintain it but now through a certain distance. He did not realize so which adversely affected his relationship with his girlfriend, Lori Collins and which (though temporarily) spoilt his relationship with Ted, but that's not always the case in real life. Relations in today's world are very tender and need to be taken care of and for that right steps and the right time needs to be taken place to maintain every relation and lead a balanced life.
By and large, these two movies, as I would like to think, merit watching work."

",-0.4939,0.7692,2019-11-13 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a money grabber and not much else. Boring story that is super slow, and no real intrigue whatsoever. The movie contains at least two dance sequences at least 5 minutes long each. Love story was a joke. Disgusting."
" Ted 2 packs more unhumorous stuffing within its formulaic synthetic fur.
",0.0,0.994,2019-10-20 00:00:00,4,"MacFarlane is a talented comedian, I'm sure of it. His profusely crude humour captivating millions with his legendary 'Family Guy' TV show. Even 'Ted' was tolerable to a certain degree, and that's saying something. Yet here we are, with an inevitable sequel, that essentially felt like a glorified episode of the aforementioned animation. It's cutaway structure for unrelated gags. Relentless wave of pointless cameos. Ted becoming Peter Griffin. Close your eyes, let the voices infiltrate your senses and you'll soon realise it's just 'Family Guy', just less funny. Ted now married and struggling to maintain his relationship, has his rights taken away when he is no longer viewed as person but property instead.A particularly strong aspect to this comedy that more or less is the power source of its story, raising a civil rights lesson in ethics and morality. It was so *interesting* that Morgan Freeman himself got involved and slam dunked the jury with his God-like soothing voice. And despite Seyfried actually picking up the script's remnants and transforming the scraps into a functional film, it's utterly forgettable. So much so, that once Wahlberg becomes drowned in rejected semen samples (literally swimming with the sperm...), I experienced a moment of déjà vu (ironically, so did Ted). Surprisingly, I had seen the first half before. Yet it took me a decent forty minutes to encounter this epiphany, that's how unmemorable this comedy truly is.It exercises all of the same plot points from its predecessor, the inclusion of the mentally unhinged Donny and the friendly break-up between the leads cement this sentiment, and rarely explored new avenues. Sure the friendly chemistry remained intact, but only one or two lines made me frustratingly chuckle, mostly due to Warburton's comedic execution (urgh, that voice...). Besides that, there's nothing here. Same old MacFarlane profanity. Worth a squeeze if you enjoyed the first film, but exhausts its preset lines of dialogue extremely rapidly. ""I love you""? Eh, please don't."

What we have is a swell buddy comedy/road movie with amazing banter, impeccable comic timing and an uncompromising approach to its humor (but never douchey about it), not a lot of attention is paid to the real problem (Ted's horrific marriage) but it's a comedy so that's fine.We also get what is at times a riveting and poignant drama on the nature of personhood."
" Funny but not as good as the first...
",-0.2867,0.9953,2019-02-21 00:00:00,5,"""Ted 2"" is a Comedy - Fantasy movie and the sequel of the movie ""Ted"" in which we watch Ted and Tami-Lynn getting married. In the meantime, they want to have a baby but they find many obstacles in front. The most serious obstacle is that the government does not recognize Ted as a person but as a property. So, Ted has to prove in court that he is a person in order to be allowed to have a child.I liked this movie and I had a really great time watching it but since I had already watched the first movie I expected more for the second. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as the first and it had some boring moments and some others that didn't make any sense of having them. The direction which was made again by Seth MacFarlane was very interesting and it combined very well for one more time comedy with romance and comedy with drama. About the interpretations, I enjoyed for one more time the interpretation of Mark Wahlberg who played as John Bennett and Seth MacFarlane's voice as Ted. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jessica Barth's who played as Tami-Lynn, Giovanni Ribisi's who played for one more time as Donny and Morgan Freeman's who played as Patrick Meighan. I expected more from Amanda Seyfried who played as Samantha and I believe that she didn't reach her potential with her interpretation in this movie.In conclusion, I have to say that ""Ted 2"" is a funny movie with many humorous moments but it's not as good as the first movie. Despite that I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to have a lot of fun and you are going to laugh a lot. If you have already watched the first movie then it would be better not to expect from it to be as good as the first, if you are prepared about it then you are going to like it very much too."

He makes it very funny referring to the american media and culture in a satirical way. Some of it's characters are so fun it is like comedy genre when it reminds you of the Family Guy and it's funny and quirky perspective way of looking at the comedy.Like the prequel this is so much fun.But it is not for everyone.Overall - 3.5/5."

Yes the film is crude and contain many F-bombs. However, I feel different about this film than the first. In ""Ted"" they were crude for the sake of being crude with the humor being secondary. In this feature they were crude for a good laugh. They didn't cross the line in this feature, although they hugged it a few times.There were numerous appearances by celebrities, mostly playing themselves. I think the role of Morgan Freeman would have been funnier if Samuel L. Jackson had played the part. He could have worked in some of his famous lines. I am also disappointed that they did a comic-con convention and didn't have a funny cameo by Stan Lee. Liam Neeson, Tom Brady, and Jay Leno in funny cameos.

" Laugh out loud moments but why the incessant drugs and swearing
",-0.0516,0.9846,2018-02-18 00:00:00,8,"I have to confess that while watching Ted 2 I laughed out loud - something I rarely do when watching a film - more often than I did during Ted 1, or any other film I can remember for many years. The dialogue is fast and snappy and although much of it doesn't hit the mark, when it does, it is hilarious.Yes, the characters do things no-one would do in real life, but then in real life no-one would have a talking teddy bear. However, I did find the relentless cruelty and bullying by the gay guys from Star Trek a little over the top and unnecessary. Likewise the almost constant drug-taking. It seems almost expected these days that any Hollywood film will have most of the main characters constantly taking drugs, and I don't really know why no-one has suggested that this might not actually be helping young people wean themselves away from drugs - it really isn't helping society. ""Oh look, all the people we look up to and who earn lots of money are spending almost every day drugged out of their minds yet they seem to function perfectly well. Can't be anything wrong with it then!"" I'll bet the drug barons are rubbing their hands with glee every time a Hollywood film rolls off the presses these days and yet more characters are seen snorting lines of cocaine as though it is the most normal thing in the world. By all means have Ted and John smoking weed now and again, but it's all they seem to talk about, and pretty much every time they stood still out came the apparatus for another hit. Too much! They were perfectly funny when they weren't smoking, they didn't need the drugs.Certainly didn't need all the swearing either - completely unnecessary and the sign of lazy writing. I don't know why writers think by adding the f-word into sentences where there is absolutely no need for it eg 'How about we get some effing breakfast' makes it any more entertaining to listen to. People don't all talk like that, it just makes the film less realistic and frankly depressing.The more films keep promoting incessant swearing and drugs, the more people will start to think it is acceptable. It isn't! Stop it!!Apart from that, I really enjoyed this film. It didn't drag despite being quite long, and although some scenes were a bit silly, there were not too many massive plot holes or daft character behaviours and the majority of it worked."
" Dumb fun for some cheap laughs
",0.4939,0.9833,2017-10-31 00:00:00,5,"Very similarly to part 1 ''Ted 2'' is nothing more than a bunch of sex jokes and pop culture references mixed together. Not that it is horrible, it's just quite boring to be frank with certain exceptions of the occasional funny one-liners.A very easy to watch film, that definitely shouldn't be taken seriously as knowing the premise itself is already more than enough to determine where the story is heading. Have to give ''Ted 2'' some credit for having a couple of clever pop culture references and its ability to make fun of the concept of the film itself. I loved how they directly made fun of Amanda Seyfried even though she was part of the main cast, a good addition to the already reference and gag based blend.Overall, just an easy to watch, light comedy about a ridiculous talking teddy bear just like the first one, it isn't any different and if you have seen the first part, don't expect anything new here."
" Full on laughs
",0.4939,0.9238,2017-10-29 00:00:00,7,"Ted 2 was not as well received from critics and fans compared to Ted. This film is still quite funny with Seth MacFarlane's typical sense of humor using clever witty one-liners or cutaways with his typical musical dance screens which is often used. Although Ted 2 may not be as good as the original, since this film is a little more depressing and light hearted, the plot is still well and the overall film is very much enjoyable and entertaining. The cast along with the supporting character all work well, as this film does not feel as long as its runtime (a little under 1 hour 50 minutes excluding end credits). Overall Ted 2 is still quite funny with many clever jokes and the chemistry between Ted and Mark Wahlberg's character is what makes the film good.As a rewatch 06/08/20' Ted 2 is as good as remembered if not a little better. This is much of the same of the original, though just a slight decline. Not as much worse as some people claim. Perhaps a little more offensive is a reason as to some people being off put."
" Better than the first part, ridiculously funny
",0.5267,0.4926,2017-10-20 00:00:00,7,"Ted 2 is a sequel (not the first plot) where we see the unique puppet-human duo on another drama sequence creating problems, well this time they are 'encountering' unexpected problems (Can't spoil any) the humor is finer in this one, I liked this plot even more, the same cast is back, except for the black-haired girl who is unreasonably absent in this one (I disliked this) and was somehow replaced by a blonde girl (Samantha) just for the sake of having another love story take place, this very aspect is both good and bad. The ending of this one is much better, and I like the idea this is no longer about some puppet-abductor fools who try over and over to steal Ted (To me that is ludicrous), it's about some real problem, law problem, and I loved how it all ended.7.5/10 , Better than Ted 1, I would watch this one again !"
" Funny but disjointed
",-0.25,0.9958,2017-08-20 00:00:00,7,"First of all, if you're reading this, I assume you saw and enjoyed the first Ted movie. The good news is that Ted 2 has a lot - and I mean a lot - of the off-color humor that characterized Ted 1. Ted and Johnny smoke weed a lot, watch TV a lot and say ""fuck"" a lot. If you thought Ted 1 was funny, chances are you'll find this movie funny as well.Now for the bad news: while it has lots of good moments, this movie does suffer from a mild case of ""sequel-itis"". It doesn't fit together as well as the first movie did, there are quite a few scenes that don't move the plot along at all and would work just as well as standalone comedy skits. The movie also falls short of Ted 1 in a few other ways. So let's figure out exactly what's wrong with this movie:1. Mila Kunis isn't in it. Now, technically this flaw applies to all movies that don't have Mila Kunis in them, but in this case, it makes a noticeable difference. Mila's character was often the voice of reason in the first film, and while Amanda Seyfried's character in Ted 2 is hugely entertaining, she is as goofy, if not goofier, than Ted and Johnny. 2. In the first film, Ted and Johnny were obnoxious and vulgar, but essentially good-hearted. In Ted 2, our heroes and their friends seem to have lost their kind touch, and descended into simply being unhindered assholes. They harass strangers for fun, cause at least two vehicle accidents and make one or two mildly racist, sexist and homophobic jokes - hardly surprising, considering Mark Wahlberg's past, but still a letdown. 3. For some reason, this movie decided to try and be a legal drama as well as a screwball comedy. While it manages not to get too boring, there are still one or two courtroom scenes that feel out of place in this movie, to the point where it's a relief when the protagonists inevitably start shouting obscenities. 4. There quite a few running gags that feel very forced and unnatural. The celebrity cameos are also fun at first, but get a bit old after a while. 5. The ending seems a bit anticlimactic, especially after the brilliant ending of the first film. It mostly fits the characters, but it seems tacked on and pointless, and missed the obvious opportunity to be much cleverer than it was. 6. They don't sing the Thunder Buddy song.Now, just for the sake of fairness, let me point out some of the utterly brilliant things in this movie that make me love it in spite of its flaws: 1. There are a couple of scenes that parody other films in utterly genius ways. I won't name any names, but if you're at all familiar with the biggest films of the '80s and '90s, you should have no trouble getting the references. 2. Ted really comes into his own as a character in this movie. The first film, despite its name, was really about Johnny, but in this one, Ted really is the one we're supposed to identify with, and Johnny feels almost like Ted's sidekick more than the other way around. 3. Amanda Seyfried is fantastic in this movie, and manages to fit in perfectly with Ted and Johnny's weird rapport. She has a few specific moments that really improve the film overall, and while I won't spoil anything, I will say that this movie would have mostly sucked without her. 4. They don't sing the Octopussy song.In conclusion, if you enjoyed the first Ted, I think you'll enjoy this one. It doesn't really work as a standalone film, but few sequels do. As long as you don't expect it to be better than the first film, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
" F. Seth MacFarlane
",0.0,-0.554,2017-07-22 00:00:00,4,"Loved Ted 1, expected Ted 2 to be OK but am sad to report its plain bad. Ted 1 did not have a strong plot, but it was consistently outrageous and laugh-out-loud funny. The gags in Ted 2 are not even loosely connected. The appearance of big name celebrities such as Jay Leno, Liam Neson, Morgan Freeman etc is mostly distracting. Not being American, I guess some references are lost on me. I found the Liam Neson cameo in Life's Too Short to be hilarious. Here, it's funny but forgettable. I'm glad to see Wallenberg and Kunis separated, but don't care for his new romance. The Giovanni Ribisi subplot was the low point of Ted 1. Why his character reappears in Ted 2 is beyond me (and how did Ribisi track the trio from Boston to NY?). The finale at comic con sucks. The nerd bashing by Patrick Warburton (who is otherwise good) is not entertaining. There are still a number of laughs. My favourite scenes were at the sperm bank and Ted driving. Memorable, funny, deeply uncomfortable. Watch them on YouTube, but skip the full length feature."
" You have to be kidding.
",0.1027,-0.0235,2017-06-11 00:00:00,1,"This could not be worse. Firstly, the 'F' word is used a zillion times in the first 5 minutes. Dirty or forceful vulgarity is so appropriate, magnificent, poignant when used sparingly and with punch at the right moment. Otherwise, i think brainless writers and compliant actors. It's not as disgusting and low life, uneducated trash talk which isn't the least bit humorous of interesting. The whole deal looked like the actors were asleep the entire show. I have no idea how they could stand doing it. I paid online and so wish i hadn't because i couldn't force myself to watch it. Making things worse was i had watched 'What We Do In The Shadows' and 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' the night before. Taiki Waititi' stuff out of New Zealand is gut bustingly the best i've seen in decades, maybe ever. Percentage-wise, American movies, especially comedy (or even drama)are so much worse than what's coming out of New Zealand and the Scandinavian ('River', 'Lillyhammer'). In this 'Ted 2', dirty language, smut, porn references, repeatedly to 'Bl--k C---'. I forced myself to watch around 15 minutes and had to turn it off. I thought, 'Mark Wahlberg', 'The Fighter' but who is this Mark Wahlberg? On reflection, i realize 'Wahlberg' does mostly stuff that's below par and produces the same. In 'The Fighter' his co-star Christian Bale does 'wow' stuff. There aren't words strong enough to say how bad this flick is. And, watching Taiki Waititi's stuff the night before made 'Ted 2' all the much worse. No, American comedy comes close to what's coming out elsewhere. I don't know if it's the Facebook generation which has made Americans unable to communicate seeping into everything, or what, but yuk. Like 'La La Land' which i thought was bad compared to Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor and Sid Charise. And, Red Buttons, Shecky Green, Red Skelton, Marx Brothers, Laurel and Hardy, Ma and Pa Kettle, Abbot and Costello, Dick Van Dyke, Steve Allen, Sid Ceasar, Jack Benny, George Burns and Gracey Allen, Jonathan Winters (Robin Williams was the only modern day comic to grave or era), Art Carney, Jackie Gleason, Richard Pryor, Red Fox, Moms Mabley, Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosbie, Flip Wilson. come to think of it we do have many black comedians today and some white dudes. Not a good show."
" We must have outgrown the teddy bear...
",0.0,0.9768,2017-04-21 00:00:00,5,"Now, I will admit that I enjoyed the absurdity of the first movie and found the first movie to be very funny and enjoyable. So of course I was expecting at least the same level from the sequel.But it went as most sequel do, the wrong way. ""Ted 2"" turned out to be nothing more than a mediocre attempt to cash in on the success of the first movie. It was lacking all the comedy and funny situations as were present in the first movie. It was a bad decision to opt for a more serious approach for the sequel, because it just didn't pan out and it failed to work in any way.It just got tiring to watch Ted and his girlfriend trying to fight for their right to have a baby, and it just sidetracked the movie entirely. It took a heavy toll on the comedy that could have been there, and they had a lot of chances to go for something hilarious.""Ted 2"" suffered from having a what seemed to be hastily written storyline which was under duress from a deadline. And whatever comedy was written into the movie, just was way under the standards set in the first movie. The dialogue, satire and jokes in part two were not even half as in-your-face as in the first movie.And it didn't really help much that it seemed like Mark Wahlberg sort of didn't want to be present for the filming of the movie. His commitment and enthusiasm from the first movie was nowhere to be seen in this sequel.Sure there were a couple of laughs here and there, but ""Ted 2"" was nowhere near its predecessor in any way. And while you can return to watch the ""Ted"" movie again and again, that proves not to be the case with the sequel. This is a watch once and let it fade into sweet oblivion situation.The only thing that had me amused and entertained was the entire scene taking place at the convention. That was actually the high point of the entire movie.It has been seen, and I can check it off the to-watch-list, and I can't claim to be impressed in any way by ""Ted 2""."
" Novelty Is Gone, But Still A Few Good Laughs
",0.8462,0.9761,2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"The original ""Ted"" was one of the most unique movies I had ever seen...and also one of the best movies I saw in 2012. I was a fan of the Family Guy-style humor, as well as the fact that a movie about a living stuffed bear could make me both laugh and feel. Unfortunately, this sequel (while still providing a number of good laughs) just couldn't live up to its predecessor in any category.For a basic plot summary, ""Ted 2"" resumes the life stories of Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) and John (Mark Wahlberg) and their crazy antics. Ted is now married to fellow cashier Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) and they want to have a ""little Teddy"" running around. However, after the obvious insemination difficulties (!), they are stymied further when Ted is ruled ""property"" by the government. The gang decide to fight the case and are assigned Samantha L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) as the junior lawyer hoping to make a mark in her career by winning the case.The obvious issue with this movie is that the novelty has worn off. In the first film, McFarlane could practically get by with the sight gag of a talking teddy bear. That is no longer the case now, with this next film having to rely solely on the humor. Much like ""Family Guy"", which is now almost completely in the tank (its comedy has dried up), ""Ted 2"" can't sustain nearly two hours on straight comedy alone. With the novelty gone, it turns into more of a generic, run-of-the-mill comedic effort.Another weakness is that the role Mila Kunis played in part one is not present here. Seyfried brings her own style to the proceedings this time, don't get me wrong, but there was a better chemistry between Kunis, Wahlberg, and MacFarlane. Again, though, perhaps that is just as much because the story is more original in that original film.All of that being said, ""Ted 2"" still managed to provide me with enough laughs to give it a decent three-star ranking. Had it not started off so terribly slow (after nearly 30 minutes, I was worried it was going to be a completely unfunny disaster), it could have even been bumped a tad higher. Unless a really original, groundbreaking script surfaces for this franchise/characters, it is likely that this will and should be the last installment in the adventures of our furry friend. I would probably see a third one...but with extremely lowered expectations."
" Another junk-movie
",0.0,0.8078,2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"After the good box-office performance of ""Ted"", this sequel was already predictable. It is especially recommended to those who liked the first film and especially advised against all people whose good sense and good taste prevented them from properly enjoying it. The film brings nothing new, just continuing the story of the obscene and rude teddy bear that shone in the initial film. Unfortunately, the manners and behavior of the creature have in no way improved, continuing to be the perfect mirror of a generation of teenagers with no prospects of life, no education, no manners and obsessed with everything that has to do with sex, alcohol or induce hallucinogenic states. The film is supposed to be a comedy but, viewed from this perspective, it takes on tragic and deeply unhappy contours. But I'm not surprised. I was not expecting Seth MacFarlane, a man who likes to make movies and serials with offensive and provocative humor, had suddenly turned into an Amish or something like that. But I remain in doubt whether the art of cinema needed another junk-film for its vast collection. In any case, the film has an advantage (the only one): as a social critic, it allows us all to think whether we want to be equal or better than that bear, and allows me (and others like me) to write texts like this."
