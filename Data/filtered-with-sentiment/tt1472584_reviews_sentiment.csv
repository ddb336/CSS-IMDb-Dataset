" Sluggish, flimsy, does the barest minimum rather than ""Max""imum
",-0.4019,-0.9966,2021-02-22 00:00:00,3,"I've just caught this film on Showtime a few minutes ago and I feel like I just slogged through the slowest moving 95 minutes of my entire existence. This has so little going for it, it's almost historical in how by the numbers this is.Before I start I do want to say that I know this was based off of the Max Steel toyline and shows, so I don't know if this is loyal in any way to the franchise's mythos. All I know from that is that a kid meets with some alien which is probably called an Ultralink, merging Venom-style to become Max Steel, and his villain is Miles Dredd. Beyond that I am under the firm belief that everything else is originally made for this film, since I don't think the TV shows could even *possibly* be even a fraction as lifeless as this film.The story's quite flimsy even after the bunch of twists thrown at you. Tiny robotic silicone-based aliens came to Earth - no reason given - and they apparently create tornadoes around them. You find out later that Max's dad is secretly an alien too (a humanoid alien, I don't know why), and he and Steel tried to stop the invasion and make some magical infinite energy maker thing based off Turbo, the energy he randomly pops off, which is inherited by Max. And then he died I guess?At no point is it ever explained why or how Steel turned against his race, or even how Max's dad took a human shape, nor how he managed to produce Max without his wife exploding from Turbo or something. And I can tell that they were probably saving it for a sequel, which is now never happening as far as I'm concerned. Filmmaking 101: stop just immediately deciding 'let's make a series' until you make a film that doesn't outright bomb. Tell a full story and *then* flesh it out, otherwise it's gonna be half-cooked like this.The flashbacks you get are extra short and too vague, and there's zero hint of Dredd even being evil to begin with until they Fant4stic you by suddenly just having him laugh at Max's dad with spooky red lights. And besides, even if that is the point you can still tell he's the bad guy just because he pops out of nowhere and is just so nice and charming or something.Speaking of which, we now get to talk about the characters, which I can best describe as a cast of cliches. We have the emo teen wanting to get with some borderline nameless chick, the bumbling parent whose spouse is dead, the nice-until-super-evil villain, the pinheaded yammer-a-minute sidekick, and the dad dude who died. Every other character is unimportant to the plot and have zero personality of any sort, which means the dialogue basically suffers from being just there to dump story and maybe some ineffective jokes. Maybe.The overall pacing of the film is very slow which especially hurts the film's short runtime. Almost the whole first two acts is just Max fiddling with Turbo, meeting Steel and doing nothing of progress until they kill an Ultralink, until you get more than one - two or three - exposition dumps from the mom, a decent fight scene and a brainless randomly materializing villain. They saved up most of the entire story for the last half hour or less, which, considering how weak it is, is a very bad move.The acting is nothing special, but bless the cast; they tried their best with what was given. Most of them at least seemed kind of invested in getting the film out of the way and moving onward with their careers. Nothing stands out but it's not outright bad.The special effects aren't really great but I will say that they're not horrible either. Definitely not Asylum-cheap though; for a small $10 million dollar budget, the suits as well as Steel himself look pretty good. On that subject the only really memorable scene is probably the final fight, as that's a pretty solidly filmed and acted battle sequence. Unfortunately you'd have to sit through this painfully long drag, with almost absolutely nothing happening, just to get to it.Now I will say that while this is another soulless cash-in on the superhero movie hype, it's not even close to the worst I've seen. Fant4stic remains the worst in that it not only has similar pacing issues and a weak storyline, but doesn't even benefit from good acting and decent effects. On top of that, it was one of those few films I've seen which was almost deliberately and needlessly insulting to fans of the source material. That film is basically the boring expository droning in action flicks that you'd normally skip, while the action is completely lazed out on or often times just in the background and barely visible. Oh yeah and you couldn't see almost anything most of the time.This one I feel like had a bit more heart put into it, but they were probably hampered by the low budget and most likely very poor writers or executives. As such you're left with a technically competent, but creatively dead husk that deserved the absolute lack of attention it got. It's just boring, painfully boring, something that no movie should ever be.If you want to enjoy this film, then watch the final fight while 120% drunk, as that is the only viable option to break through the film's impenetrable field of boredom and actually maintain some sort of simulation of the feeling of ""enjoyment"", even if it's impossible to actually be ""entertained"" by the material you're watching.If anything you would have more fun with the mental influence left behind by the alcohol you consumed. Even your horrific hangover the morning after, that would also be more entertaining than this film.Overall I don't really think this film is a very good ambassador for the shows it was adapted from, nor do I think it paints a good light on the toyline it's based off of. In fact, for a film based off of toys, it gives off the exact opposite of what you are supposed to get from them.From the Max Steel toys, you'd probably get fun. From this thing, you'd be bored to afterdeath.Rating - 3/10 (decent cinematography, solid cast and great special effects and fight choreography for a low budget, but it's all brought down by lifeless characters and a paper thin story that is paced quite poorly)"
" Overall good entertainment
",0.6908,0.9738,2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,The movie captured my interest from the start. The special effects were cool. There was a good mixture of action and setting up the story behind it all. Some amazing stunts. Loved seeing Andy Garcia. Overall good entertainment for movie night!
" Generic Boy and his Armor story
",0.0,0.1027,2021-01-04 00:00:00,4,Generic Boy and his Alien Armor story; loses any charm that would have carried over from the series.
" One of my all time favorites
",0.4215,0.3609,2020-12-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie doesnt deserve its hate. Everyone always comes to these movies that are based off of epic cartoons expecting nonstop action and adventure. They're upset that max steel doesn't get his armor or abilities till near the end. They expect him to be a marry sue but thats just not how it's supposed to be.
In live action films superheroes are supposed to struggle and train hard to earn their abilities. Not to unlock all of their powers within the first 20 minutes. This movie was intended to be a series with the first movie him bearing the armor, the second him unlocking his main 4 suits and probably reaching his full powers in the third film."
" Its a decent movie that could of been great if it diddn't have few shortcomings.
",0.6249,0.9819,2020-11-15 00:00:00,7,"I was a big Max Steel fan when I was young. So when I first heard it was being adapted into live action movie I was thrilled. However years passed by and I kept hearing it was put on hold. By the the time it finally came out I was already into young adulthood and could careless so I never saw it.Scrolling through IMDB today looking for something to watch I came across it and decided to give it a try finally. While I did like (not love) the movie. I couldn't help but be slightly dissapointed by the time credits rolled around.In my opinion I did like the cast. There was bunch of big name actors in this. Who I think did pretty good job with what they were given. I was also impressed by some of the special effects and did fine the movie comical in points. Also without giving to much away the climatic fight scene was good.However with all that said. Things like the extremely lucklaster character development, dragged out pacing, and also at times too kid friendly approach. We're just huge turnoffs. That only the most hardcore of fans can ignore. I also believe this movie suffered from just having such low budget and being limited on what can be done.I personally wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't fan as I think they be throughly confused and uttery dissapointed. Anyone who is definitely enjoy but that don't go in with high hopes."
" acceptable plot ruined by direction and camera
",-0.2023,0.934,2020-10-25 00:00:00,2,"I haven't seen any of related material, but wanted something light for the family.
The plot - despite some holes - is ok and the casting and CGI are not bad.
However everything is ruined by direction. Soundtrack, constant camera nauseating movement for no reason, brownish filter, make it very hard to watch.
Ana Villafane is the only ray of sun. The movie could have been great with more vibrant colors, more action, without camera filters/movements and a slight better soundtrack"
" Just an origin story.
",0.0,0.8723,2020-09-25 00:00:00,4,"It's not bad. Its a good quality movie.The story is just a cliché origin story about a father who is a scientist that is killed on the job. YAY! ANOTHER ONE. Oh and the dads friend turns out to be evil.The acting minus the ""girl love interest"" and characters are fine to say the least.It's just its lacking more story and character developments.
The smart IA machine acts stupid sometimes.Verdict: A gem? No. Hash? No not realky. Decent? Maybe. It's just okay."
" One of the worst ever.
",-0.6249,0.4093,2020-09-06 00:00:00,1,Why couldn't it have been enjoyable at least? Movie like Venom 2018 were fun movies even though they weren't good. Its so boring and drags so long.
" FINALLY!!! Well done family sci-fi!!
",0.5053,0.9712,2020-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Representing a diverse family ranging from Quadragenarian to Denarian, everyone LOVED watching this movie together! No need to sensor or desensitize your children or yourself for the sake of superficial ratings! Just a well done representation of good quality family sci-fi entertainment! Ben Winchell presents Max McGrath with a Lance Quest/The Last Starfighter flare, delivering a compelling performance with natural execution! Ana Villafañe also delivers a captivating performance. Winchell and Villafañe sparkle with on screen chemistry. There is mild predictability. Josh Brener brings it with comic relief and witty humor in his representation of Steel. It is a discredit to the exceptional quality of this film that a sequel has not been released as of yet."

Okay for kids maybe."
" Give me a break...
",0.0,0.0954,2019-07-31 00:00:00,3,"Another day, another young adult sci-fi movie, this one particularly disappointing and generic in tone. A fresh-faced but incredibly bland young performer essays the title role, the usual high school jock kid who turns out to have incredible superhuman powers. He then goes on a quest to battle a madman bent on domination. If this feels like a sub IRON MAN type movie, easygoing in the extreme, then you'd be right. The acting is below par, with even old hands like Maria Bello and Andy Garcia on autopilot; the lead ends up saddled with a talking drone with a voice almost as annoying as Jar-Jar Binks. As for the generic action and cartoon CGI effects, give me a break..."
" Just didn't work for me
",0.0,0.8989,2019-06-17 00:00:00,1,"So many points throughout the film I questioned why... the lead guy... WHY!!! The choices made in the film, WHY!!! So many points just didn't work, I loved Max Steel as a kid, this film is just a bad joke. But to those who enjoyed it, fair does to you, everyone has to enjoy something, all I say to any film or show, check out for yourself."
" Absolutely awful characters, plot and directing!
",-0.5551,-0.9897,2019-06-16 00:00:00,3,"This movie sounded interesting at first, but when I watched it i was in disbelief how muddy, boring and uninteresting everything was!Characters:
Absolutely terrible characterization and showcase of relationships In this film, every character is unrelatable and boring, and not to mention there is no backstory or info about his gf and mum and awful acting to suit.Cinematography:
Terrible shots, almost like a short film. CGI was really bad for the robot that follows him and his suit is absolutely hideous, I wished they ripped a page out of marvel comics and used it.Story:
Most boring and cheesy story I've seen in a while, is very similar to ""I am number 4"", but this Is 10x worse. The whole back story of this kid with powers Is stupid and the character relationships are forced especially with his gf. The movie is also a literally cum joke... his powers are always about to ""make me explode"".Conclusion:
Stay far away from this movie, honestly I'm a sucker for super hero movies (even bad ones) but even this one Is too bad that I can't bare it. DO NOT WATCH!"
" Steal
",-0.4939,0.9789,2019-03-27 00:00:00,5,"Yes we've seen many of the story twists and general story directions this takes. Now just because we've seen this before (and better done overall), does not mean this is a bad movie. It is just one, that people who've seen more than one movie before may feel like ... well not something they want to spend their time on and overall with.Special Effects are overall decent, as is the ""acting"" (always considering that this isn't a big budget movie of course). It tries to break into the big boys club somewhat and create this mythology, but I don't think it really succeeds overall with that intention. If you just want to watch something without paying too much attention to it or maybe if you watch it while being a teen (or younger), you might be more impressed than others - doesn't mean one side is more right than the other. If you enjoyed this, good for you, cherish that"
" Could of been a lot better
",0.4404,0.8869,2019-03-23 00:00:00,6,"I personally liked the movie it had potential but the writers seemed like they were trying to hard. A lot of the scenes were forced, Very predictable. The best character in the movie was steel in my opinion he was the reason I kept watching. I would of turned it off half way through if he was not mildly entertaining.
I kept an open mind before I started watching. Coupled with the fact I love watching these genres is what gave it a 6/10 instead of a 4/10."
" Too violent for children, to droll for adults
",-0.5994,0.9479,2019-03-11 00:00:00,5,"This is a typical super-hero movie with a less-than-impressive main character and a highly predictable story line.It starts out moderately interesting until the robotic character shows up-- then any trace of believable vanishes with the first sound of its Billy Crystal-like nasal voice. After that the dialog, script and concept go totally in the dumpster.The main actor did a decent enough job. In truth, the acting wasn't bad all the way around. The downside of this production is totally in the lame story, poor directing and anti-climactic everything. I'd rate this ""mediocre at best""-- a typical children's super hero film except there are some rather intense parts in it that parents may not wish to foist on their children. Consider this a ""Power Rangers"" less four, and you have a good idea of the caliber of this flick.In summary it's a yawner best left to the really-hooked-on-superheroes fans. I'd say the overall rating at this time (4.6) is pretty accurate."
" Story and dialogue are really bad, graphics are fine
",-0.4576,-0.8278,2019-02-17 00:00:00,3,"The story is boring and cliché, with your usual annoying protagonist making the dumbest choice in any situation. At least in the beginning, there is no ""golden thread"" whatsoever (though that gets a little better later); the storytelling is often extremely jumpy, while otherwise being 100% predictable.
The dialogues are often extremely staged, nobody would ever talk like that - animes with their mile-long attack announcements are more realistic.Graphics and CGI are pretty good, I'll grant the movie that.Sadly, you can't save the boring, weird story by wrapping it in decent graphics. I'd have stopped halfway through the movie if not for my OCD tendencies."
" Predictable
",0.0,-0.1775,2019-01-27 00:00:00,4,"I haven't watch Max Steel the cartoon before this so I got into this movie without knowing what to expect. I found the main character Max to be stereotypical, cheesy and not very likeable. There wasn't much character development and the storyline was too predictable to make me want to watch more. I can see how the plot might be appropriate for a cartoon series, but I guess you'll expect a bit more in a full length movie."
" Give it a go!!
",0.0,-0.4939,2019-01-23 00:00:00,8,"To be fair I thought it was a great movie. Yes it was a bit slow but that is what is needed these days. The likes of transformers, ninja turtles or other Michael Bay productions offer too much fight scenes with no plot and often action movies have fight scenes that go too quick and you struggle to keep up. This movie offers a plot and a sense of mystery. I doubt there will be a sequel however it would be good to see one and see the character grow."
" Not so bad

" Not Awful.
",0.357,0.9321,2018-12-19 00:00:00,6,"Overall, not bad. Certainly not amazing, but if you're having a date night I recommend it cause it's good to half pay attention to while you talk over it.
Main character is generic, love interest is annoying and very unecessary, and the alien is weird. Seems like they wanted to make Steel hip and cool but also have very selective amnesia? IDK.
Starts off kinda slow with the Dead Dad being mentioned almost non-stop, and tropes run rampant as they set things up but when Max discovers? Gets? Realizes his power, it gets better. I actually like the CGI, its over the top in some places but fun to look at.
Obvious Bad Guy is Obvious and his Evilness gets absolutely kicked into overdrive tow9ard the end. Theres also a misunderstanding towards the finale thats so, So annoying but yea...its decent. Better than most but very average.
Also, the Mom was pretty cool."
" Not an epic, by any definition...
",0.0,0.3612,2018-10-31 00:00:00,6,"...But, if you don't go expecting too much, it is a decent movie. It is rather choppy in the production department, almost as if they couldn't decide if they wanted to do a paranormal flick, or straight up SciFi...the acting is somewhat amateurish, but at least they try. The FX is palatable, if understated, and it does have annoying moments. Much of that is simply because they insert shaky cam to attempt making the movie more action oriented. And, as usual, shaky cam just detracts from the enjoyment of the story itself...So, if you can stand the failings, you can enjoy it...in other words, Max Steel is a watch once movie..."

Yes it did remind me of 'Footloose' at some points and 'Home' at others, but it was still unique enough to stand on it's own.

" Yes, it is as bad as the rating implies.
",-0.2023,-0.9857,2018-02-19 00:00:00,3,"I'm baffled by some reviewers claiming that the ratings would be unfair, because they'd ignore the movie's limited budget.Let's see what Max Steel has to offer:
Bad acting (Andy Garcia, wtf happened to you?). 
Bad script (""I have a brilliant plan to beat the villain! It's exactly the same someone else had previously! The villain will never see it coming!""). 
Dumb characters, who can't think straight forward for even a second. 
Annoying sidekick(s) with incredibly bad humor. At least I understand why the main character avoids listening to them.
All fighting scenes are a f***ing joke. Max Steele is pure trash and that's all."
" It is trash, movie seemed rushed and lacked pure engaging content.
",0.34,0.5384,2017-10-29 00:00:00,1,"Movie was trash. Seemed very rushed. Plot not explained well. Special effects were good, however everything else just ruins the film. The romance in this film seemed very stretched. Too much of a reach. We all know films love to get that romance between two characters who barely know each other but this one was just far too cringe worthy. Very disappointed with this film, was not able to finish watching it."
" Cute coming of age sci-fi comics, with some action to boot
",0.4588,0.8789,2017-09-24 00:00:00,8,"I just saw Max Steel. It's not a masterpiece. It's very predictable, very CGI driven, and not always thought out all the way through. And still, it's a very charming coming of age story with the sci-fi comics element serving as an enhancement of teen age issues. So the coming of age problems of finding who you really are, who are your parents and who are your friends, all get extra dimensions.The moment you see this movie, and the comics it's based on under this light, you'll enjoy it much more. The action scenes arriving mostly toward the end of the movie are more of a plot device accelerating the pace of the story while still making sense - inside the world constructed in the movie. This way we get to the very predictable conclusion in a reasonable time and without wasting long minutes on some more identity crisis and teen age angst.Technically it's all very professional, the actors do their share, most of them don't shine too brightly but they all get the job done.

" Quite entertaining, critical reviews unfair
",-0.3581,0.945,2017-09-20 00:00:00,9,"Despite the bad reviews, I actually found this film quite entertaining and for a kids film, rather cute. The special effects were great considering it is a lower budget film. In fact, I found it had more originality than most superhero plots. As far as the bad reviews, it is extremely unfair to compare this film to superheros films that have major stars and billion dollar budgets. With no major stars, it just doesn't draw as many movie theater patrons that first week. I give it a 9 only because I agree with some reviews that there could to be more of Max in his superhero costume. The kids in the audience really like the superhero persona and their outfits."

Poor acting made it had to really invest in the characters, and some writing was a little off; most notably the comedy of Steel. This movie still held some good plot twists, and is well worth watching for fans of the genre. I particularly enjoyed the suit, and the effects throughout were pretty good."

Max is interested in how his dad died, something no one talks about. As a teen Max undergoes changes and uses a device to release energy or else he will explode, but it is not puberty. It is tachyon energy and he needs the assistance of a silicon based creature called ""Steel"" go figure. Eventually Max changes into a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger with the help of Steel to save the planet from guys like Steel.This production was to strictly introduce the character without much action. It worked as well as Ryan Reynolds as the Green Latrine. Max freaking out and running off got old. They even said so in the film.The Power Ranger battle was a snooze. Steel reminded me too much of the film ""Short Circuit."" They needed a better voice...something like Woody Allen talking about...whatever it is Woody talks about. Now what I don't understand is why the Ultralinks who want to destroy the planet go out of their way to get Max Steel first. Seems he could be an easy work around. Is there something I am missing, or does the plot have that gaping hole...like no one knows who the super heroes are because they where half a mask or take off their glasses? Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Max hits a wall and starts to say the F-word, but stops."

I mean so far, 90% into this movie, i have watched just a normal teenager struggling with past family matters.Is the audience supposed to be entertained by a flying toy that can talk ? Are we supposed to be entertained by a teenager that can make sort of electricity come out of his hands ? If you can count turning a car on by using his hand as action, then this movie is for you."

Max was annoyingly immature, and the actor looked too old. So it did not fit him acting so immature. The fighting sucked, and the acting during the last part fell off even worst than it was during the movie. They made it in a manner to suggest a sequel, but should have just created it to be a one off. It's much better than some shows I watched, so I give it a four. Watch it on a day you want to just relax and talk to family. It's not meant to be a main movie night event."

",0.0,0.956,2017-04-25 00:00:00,2,"I often watch low budget, generic action adventure films and find them predictable but mildly amusing. Unfortunately Max steel did nothing for me. The plot seemed to come out of no where and there was never a sense of impending doom or the world's end. The character development was lacking, with no real depth to Max, steel, his love interest or the main villain.The action was slow, uninteresting and uncommon. Max was only in his suit one time and all we saw was a bit of mediocre Karate.If you are looking for a action adventure film, I think that any of the Marvel series will entertain you more than this. If comic book heroes isn't your thing, then something like Hancock or the hunger games are definitely more entertaining than this. I feel bad for being so harsh as i know a lot of work goes into every film, but unfortunately Max Steel missed the mark in every aspect, it reminds me of spy kids to be honest.If you do decide to watch, just sit back, enjoy and don't think to much about it. As analyzing this film will give you no joy."

Before you peg that particular rock take this into account, This movies entire budget was $10,000,000 while Ant Man the el cheapo of the MCU had a budget of $130,000,000 so drop that rock.SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!!!!Sadly it is obvious that what caused this movie just not to work...MONEY; they started with a small budget then one of the characters 'Steel' is going to be almost entirely CGI next they go for Quality over Quantity by hiring Andy Garcia (Oceans 11,12,13) as Miles Edwards and Maria Bello (The Company of Men) as Molly Mcgrath add a couple of young people to play the hero and his love interest then throw in some bit parts and extras and guess what there isn't much left.So what are you left with a script which they have had to slash huge chunks of the original story line (see below for a thumb nail sketch of the differences) and still feels rushed at the end and slow at the start. There is no real character development main character opting for the default brooding loner character and the tacked on love interest a pretty mechanic chick finally two incredibly short fights in a movie about a character who can be summed up in five words ""Max Steel Beats up Aliens'.If I had to some the movie up in a few words it would be""You can see every cent they didn't spend""The movie does it's best with the money it has but Max Steel needed a budget of at least 30+ million to try and do the character justiceTV Series The Max Steel origin story story from the Series is Max McGrath is the son of the founder of N-Tech a secret paramilitary that help keep the world safe from what is later revealed to alien invaders.

So to compete with them, they have to go through alteration, even if they loose the origins of their film's theme concept. This story is same as many similar themed flicks. For me, it looked like a mini Superman film, but made for kids.The best thing about it was, keeping everything simple. And then the pace, which actually somewhat saved the film. I hooked to it from the beginning till the conclusion, but familiarity is what killed my interest and entertainment. The characters were okay, not developed well enough. But keeping young audience in mind, it does good. Because going deep is unnecessary stretch.The story of a high school boy who transferred back to a small town where has born. As he begins to hear a lot about his father from the local people, he becomes motivated to know more about him. But one day when something goes wrong, the next day he wakes up with great power. Not knowing how to handle it, he befriends with an unusual creature and together they fight those who are after them.Initially I thought it was related to 'Real Steel', but realised only while watching it it is completely different. From the director of 'Sorority Row', I think he did nothing wrong. Those who watch less films would enjoy it better. Visually okay, with all those graphics. Since it is PG13, I would say the target audience is the little ones. So from their perspective, it is acceptable. But I warn the grownups, stay away, or be like them while watching it, in order to get entertained.5/10"

" Horrible and boring!!! It is a disappointment if you have seen the animated series.
",-0.8743,-0.9015,2017-02-12 00:00:00,2,"Max Steel is a science fiction action film based on Mattel toy line that spawned an animated TV series for some time. This is basically one of those films were you can go in with no expectations. If you really want to waste your time with it. Max Steel is horrible and something they attempted to get away with it from a low budget, a cheesy script, some no name actors, and a direction that is very tedious. I would not be surprised if a fan made video was filmed better than this. The plot is filled with holes, terrible logic, and does not clearly tend to make sense. When it does, it tries to create an expanding universe with an alien looking human that can utilize esoteric energy and then having these small aliens looking robots that fly and feed off energy. Sure, it is an origin story for Max (Ben Winchell), who feels lost with the constantly moving around with his mother. After the death of his father when he was young, the father left a company that is focused on esoteric energy that is now in charge by Dr. Miles (Andy Garcia). Once, Max learns about his father and the past about him and an alien named Steel (voiced by Josh Brener) are just preparing to facing against an evil force known as ultilink. The script is rushed with no plot, no character development, and filled with cheesy unrealistic dialogue. When we meet Dr. Miles, that knew Max's father. It was so obvious that he is not a person, who he says he is. The direction was so boring, that the music score nor script did not help with trying to get you to even care for these characters. The action and fight scenes were so basic. It looked like they did not even hire a fight choreographer. The visual effects were also terrible as we see ripples of energy coming from Max. Even, the tornado sequence with a bad guy chasing down Max was quite horrible. The acting was atrocious from about every one in the film. There is a couple of no name actors that people have never heard of and probably never will. Ben Winchell and Ana Villafane performance was one-dimensional and bad to the part were it feels noticed that they just been reading the script and not delivering any much of a characteristic. Maria Bello and Andy Garcia are decent but their performance cannot be saved from what they were given to work with. Max Steel is a terrible film that I would not recommend at all. Will be one of those films that tried to be something like other toy brand movies like G.I. Joe. Even G.I. Joe movies seem more like a masterpiece than this. Max Steel will be one of those forgettable films that will disappear until the studio plans a reboot."

",0.706,0.9896,2017-02-09 00:00:00,5,"'MAX STEEL': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi action movie, based on the popular Mattel toy series. It tells the story of a teenager, and an alien, that merge their powers together in order to become a superhero named Max Steel. The film was directed by Stewart Hendler; who's also directed the sci-fi TV shows 'HALO 4: FORWARD UNTO DAWN' (based on the popular video game) and 'H+' (co-produced by Bryan Singer). It was written by Christopher Yost; who's also co-written 'THOR: THE DARK WORLD', the upcoming 'THOR: RAGNAROK', and multiple animated TV series. The film stars Ben Winchell, Ana Villafane, Maria Bello, Andy Garcia and the voice of Josh Brener. It's received almost unanimous negative reviews from critics, and it bombed at the Box Office. I think it's a decent kids' movie, but it's definitely nothing special. Max McGrath (Winchell) is a teenager, that just moved to a new town, again, with his mother (Bello). At the same time, he's discovering he can generate enormous energy. He's also attracted the attention of a local girl (Villafane), in the new town, and the attraction is definitely mutual. When an alien, named Steel (Brener), introduces itself, things become even more complicated. The film is the type of movie that I would have probably loved as a little kid, so I definitely can't be too hard on it. I even kind of enjoyed it, as an adult, because it reminds me of the type of movies I really liked as a kid. Yes it's cheesy, and generic, but it's kind of fun.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc"

He seduces a girl and then uses his powers to protect her from others of his kind.The film was alright, not as bad as many claims. The twist was seen a mile away and the script does feel like Storywriting for Beginners, but it has a few good moments and the acting, music and effects were on- par with some of the biggest films of the decade.Still couldn't get over that fairly obvious Twilight rip-off that many YA films do nowadays though.It could also favor from showing progression more. The pace was a bit off, with him mastering his skills just a day after discovering he even has the powers. Steel also pointed out that they need to work together, which prompted a training montage, but after that they didn't really work together. This was something the film actually showed, and Steel once again pointed it out. Despite that, just moments later, they work in perfect tandem with nothing showing how they could possibly do that. The film went from ""I'm an ordinary boy"" to ""I'm the savior of the planet"" in about 20 minutes, with Max Steel (the amalgamation of the two characters) annihilating a world-destroying alien with little to no effort on the first try."
" Annoying and Dull
",-0.6597,0.588,2017-01-16 00:00:00,2,"Going into this movie, I wasn't expecting very much, given that the inherent reason of the film's production was to help sell toys to small children rather than present a good story or idea to audiences.That being said, this movie was painfully boring and was difficult to sit through. Besides the fact that the antagonist is presented as a ""bad guy"" and the protagonist(s) are presented as ""good guys"", the characters had no redeeming qualities, development, or motivations within the movie whatsoever.The actors in the film are somewhat competent, but most of them are shallow and look like they don't want to be there. I can't necessarily fault the actors on this completely; the movie is mostly comprised of characters walking into a room, sharing monotonous dialogue, leaving the room, then going to a different room to share monotonous dialogue. I'm sure I wouldn't want to be there either if I were in their position, given how terrible the final cut of the movie is.The dialogue is annoying (especially from Steel, the robotic alien companion of the main character; as far as annoying characters go, Steel is very comparable to Jar Jar Binks of the Star Wars Prequels) and is very predictable. Throughout the movie, I was consistently and accurately predicting most everything that the characters said. The story is almost nonexistent and is equally as boring and irritating as the characters.The camera-work is very standard; there are few to no interesting shots and no creativity in the cinematography whatsoever. The effects are satisfactory, even though all the effects are CGI and look like they were created in the mid 2000s.Although most of the film is comprised of boring dialogue that will put most viewers to sleep, there are a couple of dispersed action scenes that contain loud noises which will help you to keep awake during this mundane and stale film. However, the total amount of action amounts to only about 10-15 minutes of actual time on screen. I would think that a movie designed for kids would at least be entertaining from an action standpoint; despite the action scenes being loud, they are not entertaining. They are only slightly less bland than the rest of the film.Overall, I would recommend skipping out on this one. It simply isn't enjoyable. Even for kids."

So yeah, I'm not sure why people are rage hating on this but all I have to say is why ain't you guys rage hating on all the other garbage out there? Maybe if you guys rage hated earlier we wouldn't be in this situation. Anyway, I think this film is more for viewers under the age of 15 years old. It is better than Twilight, I'm guessing. Chances are it is just as good as most Hunger Games movies, I'm guess. Anyway, the little robot thing is cute. Yeah, that's all I got and in the end, isn't that what really matters?"

Again the villain is Miles Edward Dredd and the ""Ultralinks"" are the alien invaders but nothing is done to explain how Jim McGrath/Ja'em Mk'rah the alien warrior met Steele and ended up on Earth. NTek is little more then a honorary name with nothing to add to the story. And Oberto the main scientist/comic relief from both cartoon series is missing as is Max's ""Uncle"" Forge Ferris the Commander of NTex from the cartoons..... It left out many major characters and tried to ""reboot"" much of the story....Sadly by doing this this missed a great chance to do a series of films, but since it bombed in release likely the rest of the story will never be filmed......

I loved the original max steel that came out 10+ years ago where he was a secret agent as Max Turbo and Max (whatever) as the civilian. This isn't the late 1990's or early 2000's.

There wasn't a ton of gore or foul language and it had just the right amount of suspense and action that made it family appropriate. It was nice to not feel stressed out during a movie for once, but rather to enjoy it. So often with the Avengers, etc (while we love them,) you need to slow down and do something to relax afterwards when that's supposed to be the point of watching a movie. We felt that everything was explained appropriately yet mysteriously over the length of the whole film while still following a traditional superhero synopsis. A+"

",0.4927,0.987,2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Well lets take it one step at a time. 1) the movie starts well with a mystery going on around our main character and a good enough introduction of the rest of the characters. 2) the plot is good but it doesn't fit only to one movie so i hope for another one. 3) the end, well i am not gonna spoil this but the movie prepares the audience for the end (that makes the movie predictable -ish) but who doesn't like to say ""i knew it"". I liked max and defensively loved steel, i hope there was more about the background of steel and max but i put my faith on the next movie if there is going to be any. It's a movie decent enough to go on a sequel. So i am giving it a 10 because for the kind of movie it is it's very good."
" As cliché as it could be
",0.0,-0.9951,2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"A teenage boy, falls in love with the prettiest girl from the school. His dad has passed away when he was a kid, and now he suddenly discovers he has superpowers.Let's start with the basis of every film: the directing. Guess what was bad in this film? Correct, the directing. It was bland, and there was no emotion put into it at all. The shots didn't look nice, so a visual director he's not at all. But what did you expect from the same director who made ""Sorority Row"". I haven't seen that film, but the trailer, screenshots and reviews tell me that that movie isn't very good. The cinematography thus wasn't good either. For some reason they shook the camera at moments that it wasn't necessary to shake. The color palette they choice wasn't good either. It only made the shots look uglier. The editing was absolutely horrible. The beginning sequence was for some reason very rushed and rapidly edited. The tornado scene as well was edited weirdly. There was this black shot between some shots, but that black one was there for longer than a second. It felt really out of place and didn't add anything to the scene. I think they wanted to do this to create tension, because we have to ""care"" about the main character, but they failed miserably at that part. The soundtrack was also rather bad. Sometimes they tried to use the soundtrack to build up to a jump scare, which doesn't fit the movie at all. And that's another problem with the film: it wants to be too much. It wants to be a family drama, an action film, a thriller (kind of), a romance film It wants to be everything, but fails at all of these things.Let's move on from that one and go to the acting. Or what you want to call the thing they were doing. I would refer to it as ""pretending"", like kids do. The actor of Max, Ben Winchell, didn't have any charisma whatsoever. His acting was flat and emotionless and it didn't feel like he liked doing what he did. He didn't portray his character well and his performance really was lacking some substance, which is quite important if he is playing the lead role in a film. The voice actor of Steel, what a dumb name is ""Steel"", did an OK job. He was the most ""likeable"" thing you'll find in the film. This was done by Josh Brener. Maria Bello and Andy Garcia were only in the movie because, I hope, to collect their paycheck. Both of them were, just like Ben Winchell, lacking in emotion. Maria Bello gave a better performance than Andy Garcia, because Garcia's performance was even funny at times. The last person was, you guessed it: also a bad actor. This one was horrendous to watch. The person I'm talking about is Ana Villafañe. She played Sofia. What she did there didn't even come close to what you would call acting.All of the things I've just said were horrible, so the only thing that's resting is the script. That must be at least OK? No? No. The script was bad as well. Just reread the little synopsis of the film I've put at the top of my review. That summarizes the beginning of the film. Without the names of the characters this could've been a lot of superhero films. I've written it like that, just to prove how cliché this story was. I held a cliché counter during the film, but after a while, I just stopped, because there were too much. To give you a few: there's, of course, a training montage, the scene where the two good-looking leads meet each other and look in each other's eyes, the villain Every cliché out of the book you can find in this film, sadly enough. But the villain is something I really want to talk about. I saw it coming from the beginning of the film who the villain would be. The acting suggested it and when I realized that the film was rattled with clichés, I immediately knew it. They also don't try to hide it in the dialogue. There are a lot of scenes which almost directly say that he's the villain. And guess what a cliché is also? The way they kill him. It's been done so many times, but those movies were better, because there wasn't a cliché everywhere. That fighting scene too, was very anticlimactic, just like the rest of the film. The characters were also badly written. Sofia is unrealistic and stalker-ish, Max is just plain stupid and has weird character motivations/reactions. Max's reactions to the things that are happening around him were unrealistic. He doesn't panic when there's some kind of electric fluid coming out of his hands, or when he blacks out in a forest and wakes up in his bad with a rash, but totally panics when there's a flying robot. It is weird that there's a flying robot, but not freaking out with the previous named things is just very weird to me. Also, when Max finds out about his powers he googles: my fingers emit liquid energy . How funny is that? I laughed really hard at that scene, and what followed was even better. When he didn't find any results he googles: what am I? With a lot of question marks. Absolutely a hilarious scene. The flying robot, Steel, is also just an exposition machine. Max only has to ask something to it and it'll give him a ""funny"" answer, like ""pass"", or it'll rattle off everything we need to know to understand what's going on. All of the jokes were by the way bad.In the end ""Max Steel"" was one of the worst films of the year. It felt like there wasn't any emotion in it and like they didn't even try to. 1/10"
" Expected much better!
",0.4926,0.9965,2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"Max steel, did you ever watch a trailer and say to yourself ""wow this is the movie I want to watch"" and then you watch it and end up disappointed because you where expecting something much better? well this is that type of movie.When I watch a super hero movie it usually gives you a good background of the superhero's life before he got powers, It shows you his routine's, his usual habits which in my opinion these things help you get in the character and help you feel part of the movie. well this movie does it, but does it extremely short, 6 mins into the movie and he already show's signs of his powers!. Overall it wasn't a bad movie the story was good but yet could have been much more interesting. On the other hand Ben winchell did a great performance doing the super hero part and even every actor in this movie did a good performance. Although there could have been some improvements I still recommend this movie, especially if you like superhero movies and even if you don't it still provides that movie interest that you are looking for!."
" A complete recipe of a horrible movie
",-0.5423,-0.9719,2017-01-07 00:00:00,1,"Utterly awful and one of all times horrible movie. A complete waste of time with some horrible acting, script, direction and editing. The movie is missing on the very basics regarding the origin of all the characters. It doesn't show regarding any back ground and keep the audience confused as what the hell and why the hell. There is not a single element in the movie which one gets any audience for slightest of attention. The super hero in the movie tends to forget that he is having some super powers. The movie starts with a disaster and all of sudden everything starts to happening. Don't deserve any rating. IMDb should start negative points as well so i can give this movie a minus 10."
" Not as bad as reviews imply. Not non-stop thrills but an enjoyable watch because of that
",0.6393,0.9713,2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"I actually enjoyed this. After reading a few reviews I expected it to be really slow and boring but was pleasantly surprised. Sure it took a little longer going places than some of the rushed non-stop explosion fests available but that's why I liked it. It felt like it was it's own film and not just a carbon copy of all other superhero style films out there, it actually took time to build a sense of mystery and develop the characters rather than just rushing from one plot point to the next.I felt like I got to know the main character and was intrigued to see more of the movie universe unlike many forgettable action/sci-fi movies out there.If you go into the film expecting non-stop action sequences go watch the avengers, if you want something with a little mystery and gradual exploration of that mystery watch this"
" I liked the original, but this movie was just boring!
",-0.1759,0.9684,2017-01-04 00:00:00,4,"I was a fan of the original CGI show from 2000, but this is a remake of the 2013 cartoon, which was entirely different and if it's anything like the movie, not nearly as good. The first 20 minutes was pointless. Once Steel came into the movie it was only slightly better. Steel had a very silly sense of humor. (Perhaps young children will think he's funny.) We get a little bit of action and then it slows down again. (And repeat.) I understand the need to establish his origins, but more needs to happen! It's not like the boring parts even had a point. I didn't get to know Max and I certainly didn't care what happened to him.At 55 minutes we actually got an armored super hero! (For about ten seconds.)And maybe I missed something, but I wasn't even sure what was going on at times. (Nor did I care.)"
" poor movie not good enough

" Underrated but still cheesy
",0.0,0.9923,2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Far from awful, as many reviewers would like to say, and nothing to do with the 1997 film by Johnson. Based on the Mattel toy and following cartoon series, which was in my childhood a firm favourite. I went into this film with low expectations, but I came out of it having enjoyed my time spent.Let me be clear, this is not an amazing film. But it is good enough to enjoy on a lazy day.The love interest is boring, the plot linear, and the film is let down by one liners that fall flat. Special effects were good, though that is something any film these days can claim. Though it is never going to be be a work of art, I enjoyed Max Steel far more than when I recently watched the critically acclaimed Captain America: Civil War (pro tip: Do not waste your time on that).Why? This film (unlike most superhero action flicks) is not saturated in a truckload of ""Merica!"" patriotic drivel, the character relationships are far from groundbreaking but they are realistic, and it is self-aware enough that it doesn't feel the need to take itself seriously every second.As Steel proclaims ""It's called Turbo Energy!"", Max just looks at him and says ""Really?"" It made me laugh, the relationship between Max and Steel was fun and realistic enough to make me empathise with them. I loved the voice acting by Josh Brenner, and Ben Winchell as Max was surprisingly good for the mediocre role of 'tween hero'. The story hinted at more to learn in the way of lore, which I think would've been great to see unfold, but sadly will not happen thanks to the commercial bomb that was Max Steel's theatrical release."
