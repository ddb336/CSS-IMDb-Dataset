" Seemingly Never Ends
",0.0,0.4939,2021-03-27 00:00:00,2,If you enjoy watching for over an hour a person standing still in the desert this film is right up your alley. Otherwise not too much. In fairness could not finish it despite three tries and watching most of it.
" Don't waste your time

" Really worth seeing
",0.2944,0.9038,2020-11-24 00:00:00,7,"I'm very glad I looked past the low rating of this film. The setup may seem a bit too neat, but what happens in the rest of the film is completely unpredictable. Armie Hammer pulls off a bravura performance is what could have been a drab role. There is something about this film that reminds me of great short stories which take a simple plot device and turn it into a reflection on the most important things in life. Bravo!"

" Makes you reflect
",0.0,0.9896,2020-10-23 00:00:00,9,"Some movies are meant to be like that.
Without sharing any spoilers, what I mean is that, some movies are meant to be the way they are.
Some folks are saying that this movie is a big slow, but this is how it suppose to be. It is a part of the art, the process, so to speak.
A lot of messages in this movie. Messages for us viewers. About life.
Armie Hammer played his role perfectly. This movie was perfect as it was.
Sometimes when we watch certain movies, it just make our brains to shut down for a few hours. For us to relax and escape our reality.
Other movies like this one, make us reflect about our life. It won't make us escape or relax.
Anyhow I really enjoyed seeing this movie."
" Underrated movie
",0.0,0.9771,2020-09-29 00:00:00,8,"This clearly deserves more attention. A simple story with a simple set-up (%70 of movie takes place in a single scene & only one movie star) is enriched with a solid story in background. The movie starts as an action type, but evolves into completely something else. This has surprised me very much. The movie accomplishes it in a very successful way in my view. The Berberi guy's role & comments are fully understood only at the end. Twist ending leaves a nice taste.
Clearly the effects could be much better. But I think it should be evaluated more as a low-budget production."
" Excellent thriller, keeps you interested, entertaining!!
",0.8829,0.8871,2020-09-26 00:00:00,8,"Decent movie bling a high action movie. Or a war movie and just a little military. It does however have a unique story and it was done very well. Excellent job by lead actor never seen him before he reminds me of Paul Walker. Has a decent ending and leaves you with a moral thought process ending. Highly recommend, like I always say if it entertains it does its job."

I like these kind of films that have this sense of hopelessness. Didn't care a lot about the ending though. That was a bit too melodramatic and all over the place for my taste."
" When you step on a land mine...what do you do?
",0.0,-0.5859,2020-06-17 00:00:00,8,"There are dozens of war movies available.
This one captures an aspect of events that occur in war that you don't always consider.This movie follows the psychological aspects of what you might go through when you are faced with the fact of imminent loss of limb or life.Armin Hammer presents a believable portrayal of the psychological extremes you might go through.I was immediately impressed of what he immediately did when he saw his girl friend in the airport when he returned."
" Let's correct some wrong comment
",-0.4767,0.0772,2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,"Some comments here postulate that real mines do not work in a one-down/two-up way, with a ""click"" in between, stating that what is at the base of the events is so uncorrect that the whole movie is off and whorthy of a 1/10. These people, maybe expert of mines, didn't have the patience to follow the whole movie. At the end it's absolutely clear that there's no ""click"" and no ""mine"". It was a suggestion of a shocked soldier, in a credible dramatic scene. What is less credible, instead, is the start of the movie, with a mission failed for really weak reasons.
Anyway, the movie is enjoiable, with a good crescendo, well directed and well played: well above the average. 7/10"

Then they run away and get lost in the desert. The most absurd thing about the foot on the mine is that the mine trips when you rest your foot, not when you take it off.
Then you really spent $ 5 million on putting, one with one foot on a can for 90 minutes. Really really bad."
" Brilliant military psychological thriller ( American C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10
",0.6369,0.9859,2020-02-29 00:00:00,8,"One of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. Well-acted from Hammer, intense and thrilling, as well as emotionally resonant. Some aspects of Hammer's character may come off as cliche, but it is still an amazing character journey to watch. I enjoyed every scene and every threat the protagonist had to overcome. I was on the edge of my seat from the moment he stepped on the explosive device. The film made great use of its single location and I cannot believe the negative reviews it received. Amazing work from Armie Hammer. Give him more credit please."
" Super Disappointment
",0.1531,-0.0969,2020-02-21 00:00:00,1,"This movie was a total waste of time.
Should have been 30 mins long only & thanks to idiotic script, directors, producers, too many flashbacks that had NO bearing on the film.2 man team goes on mission, fails to acquire target, retreats to desert for several hour hike for extraction & get caught in mine field. Spotter get blown up by mine & sniper stuck on mine for days..then extraction team shows up. Thats all that needed to be shown & everything else was a bloody waste of time & detracted from an otherwise good film.Thanks to all the needless flashbacks, I awarded this film a - 200 trillion score but can only put a 1.Watching paint dry more entertaining."

VERY few...90% of the film is ONE guy standing on a landmine, and it works!!I will admit...towards the middle it does drag a little bit, the flash backs and ""dreams"" get rather old FAST, but overall this is WELL worth watching."
" Too Long and unfulfilling
",0.0,-0.2008,2020-01-28 00:00:00,3,"Starts well but obviously didn't know where to go from there. Not a thriller after first 15 minutes and pointless in the end, give it a miss."

" Do NOT waste your time (or money)
",0.3252,-0.9443,2019-10-09 00:00:00,1,"The worst sniper in the HISTORY of snipers, and his equally incompetent teammate, sits overtly on top of a cliff where they let a clear and easy target get away after a ridiculous hesitation / arguing. Meanwhile they ask a faceless authority, obviously located in a command place somewhere off location, over the comms what to do about obvious situations.
Then, the sniper makes sure to blink his unmasked scope enough for the targets / enemies to spot them, where after they immediately try to escape along a non planned route. During this, they throw their weapons to the ground, down a hill, instead of simply holding them in their hands when jumping down them selves.
This is so amateurish, completely not researched and stupidly executed in the first four minutes alone, that the script and directing looks like little more than a bad high school project. This has NOTHING to do with a realistic situation what so ever. Shame on you for demanding money to watch this complete garbage of an attempt at a movie."

" Better Than Average War Fare - Mine
",-0.25,-0.7323,2019-09-22 00:00:00,6,"Although this film has a few holes in it; it manages to keep the attention of the viewer through some clever editing. The sequences do have a few stereotypes, but some of the sequences are breathtakingly original; especially the ones with the animals and enemies. There seems to be a bit of confusion in a few of the hallucinations, but that is the nature of hallucinating, right? The area of the stranger and his daughter in the desert, however, is the weakest part of the film, as it has a dubious beginning, middle and end. Other than those sequences, the film is highly believable. A very good performance by Armie Hammer."
" Close to Oscar worthy writing and performance if edited down a bit.
",0.4404,0.6341,2019-08-16 00:00:00,9,Bought the DVD at Big Lots just to see Armie Hammer hold his own in a movie. I was not disappointed. I was riveted throughout the entire film. The writing and pacing reminded me of classic '60's Combat and TV Western episodes that could brilliantly focus on a brief and simplistic plot line in order to slowly ratchet up the suspense and tension till ya' can't stay still in your seat.One quibble is it went too long toward the climactic ending. It kept introducing unnecessary flashbacks that psychologically motivate Armie's character's decision making where you can't tell which are from his memories of his past relationships with friends and family or from him losing his mind and seeing visions from being out in the desert standing for hours with his foot on a land mine.The movie put me there with the character and that's the mark of a well made movie. I can't believe it's gotten so many bad reviews.
" Done before but much better.
",0.5927,-0.1976,2019-08-04 00:00:00,5,"Mine starts promising, becomes boring at one point, and ends just poorly. It's a mediocre movie, really nothing special about it. In fact I watched two similar movies (I don't remember the exact titles) and they were both much better. I wouldn't say the acting was bad, the main character did a great job standing on a mine for the entire movie, but at one point the story just doesn't make much sense. What should have been a suspenseful movie (considering the situation of the soldier) just turned out to be a boring story. Did I waste my time watching this? Yes."
" a story of courage
",0.4939,0.9807,2019-07-22 00:00:00,7,"I thought this was going to be a psychological profile because the guy is stuck on a landmine. Anyone who thought it was a war film might have missed the synopsis. I admit, I thought the acting was B-level and the film seemed slow. But once you start realizing what's happening you just need to see where it goes. One reviewer said it's about both physical and psychological strength, and that does describe it. It's about moving forward and not letting your mind trick you. I love the line from his mother who says ""I'm not afraid of letting go of the struggle,"" as she lay in a hospital bed. I agree the little knee thing at the end was kind of odd -- is the producer saying that marriage is a landmine? Or maybe he's just saying it's a different kind of kneeling.
For all those saying this is so unrealistic, I think you miss the point of the film... the soldier was pretty off his marbles, in case you didn't notice: he refused to complete a mission based on some bs going on in his head. Both he and his partner seem pretty sun baked and delirious. Marines are tough, true, but everyone has their breaking point. These guys were in the desert blending into the sand for 3 months, and then the cute guy blows the mission. Now they are stuck traipsing through dust and 120 degree heat with sand for miles... I'm pretty sure the director had permission to make Mike hallucinate. If no one researched that, that's on them. But if they knew and used that scenario anyway, I think it just fits with the film."
" A Tale of Two Fools
",-0.4939,0.267,2019-07-20 00:00:00,1,"Hard to believe trained Rangers would be so flippant about crossing a minefield. Also, this sort of film is very unoriginal. It's been done a hundred times before. Seeing the main character act so casually with his foot on a mine. It's ridiculous. Can you really hold your foot on a mine for hours? And as someone said, the mine would blow up as soon as you stepped on it.Can't recommend, treat it as a comedy and maybe you will get some enjoyment out of it."
" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.8439,2019-07-12 00:00:00,1,I suffered through this mess and it was absolutely terrible. The ENTIRE premise of this movie is rubbish. If you step on a land mine it blows up...simple as that.
" Mine, an intriguing and moving film
",0.0,-0.4654,2019-06-22 00:00:00,10,I will start by saying I am an Armie Hammer fan so it is easy for me to love this film. It is a different perspective on a war film that you wouldn't normally expect. The film delves into the human mind and spirit that I found deeply moving as war is hell and takes a toll on the whole of a person. An intriquing and moving film.

",0.0,0.5092,2019-05-19 00:00:00,4,First half of the movie was quite enjoyable and well done. But all the flashbacks of the second half are just too long and not convincing at all. It could have been an ok movie. The supporting cast is just ridiculous and unnecessary.

" I don't understand the negatives
",0.0,0.8967,2019-04-08 00:00:00,9,This movie was incredible. Something different. It actually had to stand on its own with acting rather than CGI screens and special effects. And it did just that. Armie Hammer did a fantastic job playing his role as someone trying not to die and then having to fight his demons while on his own in the desert for days. For those who enjoy movies that have a story this one is for you. I was entertainied from beginning to end.
" Step Off Marine!
",0.0,0.9202,2019-03-31 00:00:00,5,"A pretty cheap film to make. It starts pretty well with two Marines on a sniper mission somewhere in Africa - Mali, Sudan, Chad, etc? It ends somewhat better. But the middle is pretty boring - over two days of the main character keeping his foot on the mine. It has flashbacks, hallucinations, gunfire, a strange nomadic Bedouin man shows up and leaves several times, etc in this part. A much better story line could have been written for the middle of the film to make it more interesting. Use the fast forward button liberally with this film."
" Technically lacking
",0.0,0.0,2019-03-31 00:00:00,4,"Technical inaccuracies abound
-The precision rifle the main character used has a cheap chinese scope on it, not the S&B one they would be issued.

" I've seen this one done before but better.
",0.5927,0.93,2019-03-30 00:00:00,3,I recall seeing a story like this on HBO about a soldier that stepped on a mine during Vietnam except his story was real and not some work of fiction like this movie was. I don't know what gets me about these all American invincible white soldier movies where the guy survives against all odds in situations where he would most likely be dead.This movie happens to fall along those lines but its intertwined with some home town badass turned soldier story or so it seemed. It also had nothing to do with the land mine but whatever. I would recommend to anyone watching this movie just watch to where the guy and his friend get to the minefield and then after that bit of drama is over turn it off because that's the only interesting part about this film.

" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.992,2019-03-19 00:00:00,2,"If you're expecting a movie with the basic premise is the nature of combat, you'll be disappointed. While this guy is a sniper in the military this movie is a philosophical presentation dealing with ones mortality, choices in life, and moving forward from bad decisions. The whole philosophical debate gets started because he steps on a mine and if he takes his foot off it will explode. Very unrealistic but they had to make this debate start somehow. Also, since the civil war when the military would find rifles with multiple ball and shot loaded but no shot taken they realized they must train people to dehumanize and objectify the enemy to make it easier to kill. If this guy is a highly trained sniper he would not spend 30 months chasing this guy only to say ""it's a wedding, I can't shoot him"". That was just plain stupid. I would have shot the guy just on general principle.It's a boring movie, you don't feel anything for the guy because there is no character development and the whole premise is stupid to begin with. If you're having trouble sleeping, put this movie on and you'll be out within 10 minutes"
" A fun watch. ONCE
",0.5106,0.9782,2019-03-18 00:00:00,5,"This movie is just okay. I feel it loses itself about halfway through. Mr. Hammer is serviceable but i think Tom Cullen was the show stopper and deserved much more screen time than he got. His character throws off vibes of Jon Bernthal from early walking dead episodes and i really enjoyed their dialogue and banter early on.
Clint Dyer is great in his own right too, probably making the most of his lines over anyone in the film and easily the most memorable character. It becomes a kind of psychological delve into madness (or tries it's best to) later on in the film, which is a fun change of pace but the shallow writing runs is course pretty quickly.
Nothing to do on a Friday night? Grab yourself a six pack, maybe invite a couple of friends over and give it a watch. You may not remember it next week but it will keep your attention through it's manageable run time. Decent/fun little ending, if not a little predictable. Would rate it higher if it had even the slightest hint of rewatch-ability."
" Something different.

Well, they did it and yes, it is sometimes boring but it does tell a story of survival vs ones own mind, and environment. Action seekers won't find much appeal to this one but if you're bored and looking for something different to kill time with more of a dramaish story. Try it out! Film was shot and acted well."
" A cliche nightmare

" Don't Step on this Trap of a War Movie
",-0.7597,-0.9914,2019-03-12 00:00:00,4,"If you enjoy war movies and military films, you will be enticed to check this out as I did on a day off.
Boy did I regret it! I had seen this pop up in my recommended movies due to recently seeing The Wall (also a simple concept war film that's pulled off significantly better), Hold The Dark (another Netflix original that attempts to copy Wind River with some slasher/horror elements, but fails, with does have some interesting war backstory sprinkled in), and Kilo Two Bravo (the real war movie based on a true story, with lots of land mines, that you want to watch instead of Mine).The Pros: A character-driven story of what a trained marine could go through mentally and physically while stuck putting pressure on a land mine after seeing his buddy get killed right in front of him by the very same thing.This movie has some decent special effects, from the sandstorms to the pyrotechnics and other CGI. The feral dogs that attack our main character soldier, Mike, are iffy in some brief parts but they are kept in the dark ala The Grey with Liam Neeson.The Cons: The interesting story of 1 man standing on a bomb for the majority of the film falls flat on the lack of acting chops of Armie Hammer. If this movie had a different, better caliber lead, this film would've been much better as it relies almost completely on Armie's character of Mike to carry the narrative in flashbacks and his struggle to stay awake, stay balanced keeping pressure on his foot, and surviving dehydration, hallucinations from sun stroke/heat. Armie's acting just isn't enough to carry this film as a result as he's a rather 1 dimensional good-looking face with stiff acting versatility.The acting of all the side characters don't fare any better and therefore the movie just feels like the cheap, straight -to-dvd/Redbox release that it is, basically.The writing is sub-par. The things that Mike does throughout his ordeal of standing on a mine are ridiculous, simply put. SPOILER: Mike is shown at the end to take the step of faith to get off the mine after being shot several times (yes, multiple shots from an AK or high-powered rifle), after being bit by rabid dogs, and being dehydrated & suffering from likely heat stroke (why is he not wearing his scarf over his head or his dead buddy's hat to shield the sun?), but it is revealed the mine was actually a tin can all along. As a result, we are not really shocked because the numerous times that Mike falls, stands, gets shot, stumbles, throws punches at his hallucinations of his abusive father, etc. all would trigger the mine time and again if this were a real thing. Now, suspension of disbelief is one thing, as we do this in many movies when reality is stretched, but if you're a war movie buff, you just can't buy into this as Mike time and again does something physically that would cause the pressure to set off the pressure detonation.I gave it 5 out of 10 stars for some moments of creativity in what the character could possibly experience while in this limited position and hostile environment, but as it dragged on, I just felt compelled to watch The Wall or Kilo Two Bravo again instead."

This film brings out a marine and his will to 'survive' coming face to face with what seems to be his inner demons OR unwillingness to be vulnerable, alike his friendship with tommy, where he doesn't talk much about personal things.I am all for a war film that is portrayed accurately and I do agree with some negative comments that a lot of stuff in it would not happen in real life. But if you watch this film PLEASE understand that it is about a tough marine who through many of life's challenges (scene towards the end as he is kneeling) learned to let go and to 'keep moving forward'. I challenge you to watch this again if the first time you hated it but look at it in a much deeper rooted perspective. Job well done to Fabio & Fabio."

" Pretty good but could have been great
",0.8658,0.8677,2019-03-07 00:00:00,7,"MINE is a psychological thriller with a very interesting and relatable message. The problem however, is that this message is made brutally clear repeatedly. A good psychological thriller will leave you thinking even after the credits roll. The problem with this movie is that it doesnt do that. It over explains itself until the message could be explained by a child, and then it explains itself more. Had this movie been more subtle, it would have stuck in the viewers head. Had them thinking about it and trying to understand it.The acting in MINE is phenomenal. 90% of the movie is focused on 1 character, Mike. Armie Hammer does a great job of showing the viewer all the layers in Mike's character. Showing a man go from a level headed marine to a man who is on the brink of death and losing his mind... and showing you everywhere in between... is not and easy task. But Hammer does this spectacularly.I can't overlook the mistakes in this movie. The 2 marines are in a desert where sand storms are clearly frequent and they dont seem prepared at all. They would have brought something to cover their heads surely. Also, they seem surprised and unprepared when they dont have any extraction options when the mission fails. No escape, when even had their mission gone successfully they would have found themselves in the same predicament. These problems with the movie could have been easily worked around with some more story writing but instead we were rushed to the actual Mine scene and are expected to not question the sloppy writing at the beginning of the movie.Between the acting, the music, the effects, and the message this movie is very good. Had they touched up the story in the first 20 minutes and not made the message so brutally obvious, i could see myself giving this movie a 9/10"

Mike refuses the order to shoot at a wedding with less than trustworthy intel. They barely escape into the desert hidden by a sandstorm and encounter a landmine warning. Tommy is not impressed and pushes onward. He detonates a mine and Mike steps on another one.Neither guy is particularly smart or reasonable. First Mike has to give a better reason to not shoot the target. Maybe the target is holding a child. Second these guys are talking way too loud. Tommy is a loudmouth and annoying as hell. Third if Mike suspects landmine, he should be much further behind Tommy. He comes off as a little whiney. Honestly, I've not liked Armie's sensibilities as an actor. The Arab is infuriating and so is Mike. Also with so much sandstorm activities, it's unlikely anybody knows where the mines are. Mike's assumption is obviously wrong and the Arab's idea about walking a straight line is simply stupid. There is so much wrong with this script that it would be better if it's all a dream."

" Breakthrough performance for Armie Hammer and his role in making a film steps forward
",0.0,0.9153,2018-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Obviously it's not a war movie, maybe it's called MIKE more correct to match the theme.
Armie played a solo who was haunted by his past life failure, escaped away to be a soldier, happened to be stuck in the desert. In that dead end, reflects his life and finally he found the answer. 
1 hr 46 mins, I just so obsessed with the performance though it's all made by one character. Every expression every movement is correct, so made the movie so persuasive. 
However, even so hard situation in the movie, it's not boring. The characters like Tommy and the Berber, made the movie easier and funny, also the ending song, after a long term intense, is kind of a relax and enjoyable.
What plus surprise is, the credit says ""Produttore Esecutivo(Executive Producer) - ARMIE HAMMER"". Great job!"

Even though if you step on a tin can berried in the sand it doesn't make any noise. Also he could of easily put something heavy in his shoe and took his foot out. Would not recommend."
" Pretty good, but it still felt like a slight missed opportunity to me (MAJOR SPOILERS)
",0.802,0.1017,2017-12-02 00:00:00,6,"Mike (Armie Hammer) and his colleague and spotter Tommy (Tom Cullen) are both tasked with assassinating a high profile terrorist. However, the assassination attempt fails and when they are spotted by the terrorists both men are forced to run for their lives across the desert. After evading capture, the two men decide to walk to the nearest village (after their GPS fails), but tragedy ensues when Tommy steps on a land mine (resulting in him losing both his legs). Things worsen when Mike also steps on a land mine, but he has the foresight to keep his foot on it (in order to not trigger an explosion). As a result of this, Mike is forced to endure several hours and days in the desert and must use all of his skills to try to survive this terrifying ordeal...For the most part, Mine is a fairly engrossing film (although I found Tom Cullen's character to be a little irritating truth be told). However, when Mike is isolated in the desert on his own then the film does become much more involving - the unfortunate predicament that he finds himself in did help to keep me involved in the story.Despite the seriousness of Mike's predicament, the film does have a sometimes surprisingly light-hearted tone; a local villager discovering Mike alone in the desert who doesn't seem to grasp the peril of the situation that Mike is facing was a really nice touch to the film and provided the film with some humour; it actually balanced the film out well as he would often turn up after Mike has faced a perilous night alone in the desert. This villager isn't merely there as comic relief however and he does inject some pathos to the film and understands Mike's predicament more than Mike initially believes.In the latter stages of the film we start to witness Mike slowly losing his mind after he has spent a number of hours and days alone in the desert. I can understand what the filmmakers were trying to do here, but a lot of these moments felt a little choppy and messy - they are effective in the moment I suppose, but they don't add much to the film and don't really allow us to learn much about the principal character. Some of the lighting and editing is quite poor as well which sometimes took me slightly out of the action - although I'll admit that I was never bored when watching this film.Armie Hammer (yes I know he sounds like a brand of toothpaste) is not an actor that I'm all that familiar with; I've seen him in the film version of The Man From Uncle, but that's the only other film I've seen him in as far as I can recall. To be fair I liked him in The Man From Uncle and I thought he was solid in this film as well. Carrying a film for large portions of time on your own is probably the most challenging job that can be bestowed upon an actor, but Hammer does a great job here and takes us through this perilous and emotionally draining journey very well.The major issue I had with this film is mainly down to the narrative; we see at the start that Mike steps on a land mine, but it's revealed at the end that he actually stepped on a tin can (it's explained earlier in the film that the villager dug up some of the land mines and replaced them with tin cans so that the metal detectors wouldn't know any different). This was a bit of a rug pull to me as you could hear something click when Mike stepped on what we all believed to be a land mine. Also wouldn't it have been better if the whole section about replacing land mines with tin cans was omitted till the end and thrown in as a twist? I suspect that when this was revealed about halfway through the film that some people may have seen what happened at the end coming..All in all though this is a fairly enjoyable and engrossing film (despite some sloppiness within the narrative). It won't be for everyone, but for anyone that enjoys watching a 'one man surviving against near impossible odds' type of film then I would say that Mine is worth a look."
" A walk to the far side
",0.0,-0.8434,2017-12-02 00:00:00,3,"A bottle movie although the confined space here is really the desert. It does not help that Mine stars, failed leading man Armie Hammer who despite his best efforts has never risen above giving a passable performance in his film career so far.Hammer plays a US marine sniper Mike who after a failed assassination mission sees his colleague Tommy blown up by a landmine and he then steps on one.The film is really Mike standing still for several days, afraid to take a further step, semi hallucinating and having flashbacks of his life as he tries to reach his radio and call for help.A Berber nomad visits him and tells Mike to move on, the nomad's daughter sometime turns up to give him some water.It is left to Hammer to carry the film but he does not have the skill or script. It does not help that we have no idea where in North Africa this film is located on. We can guess that the Berber is an almost mystical figure, is he telling Mike to physically or mentally move.We get flashbacks of Mike's abusive household, his tumultuous love affair, his camaraderie with Tommy. It is all a rather clichéd but it does have an emotional ending.I did wonder why actor Tom Cullen who played Tommy sounded Australian. Of course it would also be impossible for Mike to stand on the trigger for so long without moving his foot and this is not how landmines work."
" It's not a bad action movie, it's a good thriller!
",0.7537,0.9502,2017-10-28 00:00:00,7,"Mine is the story of a Marine who's waiting for assistance to retrieve him from a particularly dangerous situation. Be careful about the genre because you have to realize that it's not a movie packed with action, instead it's a thriller packed with suspense.I find myself rating this picture with a solid 7 out of 10. In my opinion there's an evident issue with its contents. It's a movie that can be split in three very distinctive parts: it starts off really well, after a while we face a pretty long boring part (which lasts about 25/30 minutes), and then everything gets extremely better. There's nothing wrong with the main plot, actors are great and each and every soundtrack is pretty enjoyable. Conclusion: it almost made me cry, it's something worth watching!"
" It's a very difficult film to keep and it does not
",-0.4201,-0.201,2017-09-15 00:00:00,4,"I begin to see this film, because what strikes me is what it is going to tell and see if it manages to maintain the tension. For me it does not and the worst thing is that in the attempt, it starts to play so many songs that you do not know by which it wants to go and it does not close any. You do not know if what it means is that war is done only by people with ghosts, without culture or if you want to go other ways, but it is that opens so many.The first thing I do not believe, is what happens at the beginning of the movie and that brings back the whole film. Does anyone think a Marine is making an order? To average film, it responds what I believe is what it means by the film. He responds alone, releases the anti-militarist dialogue. But it is that then it goes by so much paths that I miss and I get bored a little.The actor is very well. I believe it all the time, it seems that really happens all that. And the makeup is great. It seems that the lips are really in a desert.He has a very nice picture. I think I should have used her more, having told more about her feelings and the anguish we are supposed to spend with him. But at least it's useful.The direction, it does not become good, since there are moments that bores, does not know which way to touch, could have made some very beautiful plans and it has not done them. However, many times you see how the plane changes, not to be bored, to give it rhythm, but the rhythm should be created internally, not changing planes. That only shows that you do not know how to put the camera and you do not care about a plane that another.But that yes, has made that even not making a good movie, see it attentive."
" War , what is it good for? Making us appreciate the times of peace.
",0.6369,0.9924,2017-09-05 00:00:00,9,"Loved this movie. The basic story line – a soldier (in the middle eastern desert), a sniper , after failing to take down his target in a moment of what can be described as weakness/sentimentality, steps on a land mine while escaping the opposing forces. He is aware enough to not step off the mine as it will detonate. He is paralyzed with fear , he knows that he will be killed if he moves off his mark- one misstep and he will be blown to pieces. He needs to wait for an extraction team but the desert is looking to consume him. While he waits, visions of his past haunt him and his family relationships come back to him as he looks for some sort of resolution. In a dreamlike state he meets a desert native that has much to offer in the way of guidance – is this real or just his mind helping him cope with the situation? There's a basic, primal and instinctive desire to live, to survive and to find some way to make it through the trials and horrific situations that life can present you with. That's what this is about. The trials are not always in the present , not always something that has to be dealt with at the moment but they have an impact on how you deal with those situations as they happen in ""the now"". Some reviewers have issues with the technical aspects of being a sniper, the politics or the military jargon - yeesh, get over it – the movie is better than that and its message is so much more important. The acting was terrific, heartfelt and compelling. Armie Hammer was perfectly cast and pretty much the whole show. I loved the setup, the body of the story and the ending. It does not disappoint. I have only good things to say about it. An inspiring story and though it is fiction, the situations may ring true for many of us."

" Expect a lot of standing still in this movie
",0.0,-0.9244,2017-08-21 00:00:00,6,"""You're a very lucky man. You step on a mine and it doesn't explode. You spend the night in the desert and the animals leave you alone. You're a very lucky man, Mike and Michael!""Guess it wasn't that simple to do this. Making a film that focuses solely on an American marine named Mike (Armie Hammer) who stepped on a landmine and who doesn't dare to take any further steps. For 90 minutes, there's nothing else to see than this soldier who has to wait 52 hours for a patrol to help him. Help that comes too late for his partner Tommy (Tom Cullen). He won't be able to break the record on the 100 meter sprint, as both his legs are spread over a few square meters after walking on a landmine himself. And, in my opinion, the thought of a leg-less existence was too much for him as well. And now Mike is standing, kneeling and balancing there in the middle of the desert on an unexploded landmine, exposed to the elements of nature and from time to time deep in thought. The ultimate survival test.So, don't expect real action-packed scenes in this movie. Only the delusions and flashbacks as Mike gets more and more tired, are presented in multitudes. And an odd, funny looking Berber shows up occasionally to bring water and have philosophical conversations with Mike. And afterwards he disappears again over the next dune. Whether this Berber is real or just a figment of his imagination, is hard to say. Certainly, he gives Mike something to hold onto so he won't go insane because of dehydration, the heat and lack of sleep.Hammer's performance is solid and convincing. A man who tries to survive in dire circumstances and at the same time tries to come to terms with his past. A childhood filled with domestic violence from an aggressive, alcoholic father. To be honest, it's not hard to be the star of a movie when you're actually delivering some kind of solo performance and there's no other role that has a decisive impact on the movie. In this case, Hammer has the stage completely for himself and he can demonstrate the talent he has as an actor. And that is the most commendable of this film. Despite the intriguing concept, the content is too limited.You can also interpret this movie in a metaphorical way. Everybody tend to end up in a so-called mine field once in his lifetime. A difficult period in which making a thoughtful decision is necessary. But because of the fear of taking risks, one freezes and is scared of taking that next, crucial step. Sometimes it may be advisable to take a next step, although there are consequences, instead of standing still. A tremendous dilemma Mike is facing and something the enigmatic Gerber tries to explain to him all the time. Due to the subject and the total lack of action, you may call this a boring movie. At one point, one hopes that this bloody landmine would explodes. Just to stir up the tension. And yet, this movie managed to hold my attention and curiosity. Never thought that a non-exploding landmine could be so intriguing. And again, praise for Armie Hammer and his commendable performance.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"

I am glad i never listen to the critics.The music was beautiful , the acting superb , the story and scenery were all excellent but yet some people feel the need to traduce it because its not full of action and they knew what was coming.It never was an action film but focused more on human frailty by centering itself on the human element of the main protagonists life and really pulled out all the stops , its one of the best films i have seen this year.If a film can evoke emotion from the audience and it did with me then its a winner in my book. Armie Hammer pulled it off well and his acting ability is proved for me in this film although Clint Dyer nearly stole the show!Don't listen to the critics , go view this I guarantee you wont be disappointed if you are looking for more than a war film with loads of CGI , Violence , Swearing and nudity.

",-0.5994,0.3804,2017-07-13 00:00:00,8,"Mine is a unique film about the psychological effects of war. I'm not talking about the mind's stress during combat, nor the after effects of PTSD. This is something different all together, and very well executed. It's not really a war movie... it's more of a psychological thriller.Directors Fabio Guaglione and Fabio Resinaro did a fabulous (you see what I did there lol?) job putting this film together with excellent cinematography, VFX and editing. Although I hate slow paced films, and this one was, it was riveting enough to hold my attention. Armie Hammer was outstanding in his role.Very enjoyable and one of the better war-type films I've seen. It's an 8/10 from me."
" Spends way too much time on family drama, but it's still worth the watch.
",0.3291,0.8917,2017-06-22 00:00:00,7,"'MINE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A psychological drama/war film about a US Marine that's trapped on a mine, in a North African warzone for over two days. It was written and directed by debut feature filmmakers Fabio Guaglione and Fabio Resinaro. The film stars Armie Hammer, Annabelle Wallis, Tom Cullen and Clint Dyer. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, and only a limited indie theatrical release at the Box Office. I mostly enjoyed it.Mike Stevens (Hammer) and Tommy Madison (Cullen) are two US Marines on assignment in North Africa. After Mike fails to assassinate a military target, the two soldiers are spotted by enemy forces and pursued. After the Marines are able to evade their pursuers, they stumble through a mine field, unwittingly, and Tommy is killed while Mike becomes trapped on a mine. Mike uses a military radio to call for help, but he's informed he'll have to wait two days until anyone can come get him. This becomes a huge endurance test, and an even more gruesome psychological battle, for Mike and the viewer.The psychological thriller aspects of the film are great, and there's also some touching drama involving a mysterious local inhabitant (played by Dyer) that helps Mike. Hammer is also good in the lead role, and the film is another admirable tribute to US soldiers. The movie is not so fantastic though when it spends way too much time on family drama (from Mike's past). There's also a little too many flashbacks involving his fiancé (played by Wallis) and crazy dream/hallucination sequences. I think the film would have been a lot better at something more like 85 minutes, instead of 106. Still it's worth the watch though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/KR0HDeT91m0"
" So boring. Unbelievable with characters. and a flat direction that seemed unmotivated for a survival thriller.
",-0.3642,-0.9955,2017-06-14 00:00:00,2,"Mine a psychological thriller movie about two US Marine soldiers Mike (Armie Hammer) and his partner Tommy (Tom Cullen) are trapped when they both step on a land mine. Now, this could have been a well intense film with its concept idea about survival on a desert with limited supplies and body movement and the wildlife and nature taking a toll on the victims in this situation. Well Mine completely fails about everything in the movie. Directors Fabio and another Fabio could have put more thought into their filmmaking and have a survival tone and vision made for the movie. First, the script was terrible. It was difficult to believe that the dialogue with the two marines would be this bad. Sure, Tommy was by far an annoying character and acting like an amateur. It would be hard to believe he even made it to boot camp with his attitude. There was no character development which should have had potential too. We learn about Mike and the flashbacks of his abusive father beating his mother. His struggling relationship with his girlfriend Jenny (Annabelle Wallis). His character struggles being stuck on the mine with dehydration, sandstorms, and even wild dogs. His character is changing and it shows how he is affected psychologically. Especially, when Mirage takes place and his hallucinations makes it difficult on trying to tell whats reality and whats not. Also, the dialogue with their command seemed unreal. After the two marines disobeyed a direct order. When they attempted to seek aid and ask for an evac. The responses the command center was giving did not seem believable. The direction was very boring and dull. Some of these survival movies like 127 Hours worked so well cause of Danny Boyle's direction on showing the characters inner state and how he is slowly drifting between the balance of life and death. Seemed like a concept that Mine should have done. But we don't get much at state of Mike's struggle. Cause the script was one dimensional with his character. Armie Hammer performance was stale and flat. Annabelle Wallis talent was wasted here with just flashback scenes and some brief moments of the hugging memories. Tom Cullen was so annoying with his character. Sure, your suppose to be feeling emotions and bad for these characters. But when viewing, these characters are flat and it was difficult to even care for when they are facing death. The movie was boring after the half hour mark. Seeing Mike stuck out in the sun, trying to hold his sanity together. The movie did not do much to build this momentum on him trying to hold it together. It literally was him waiting out there and hallucinating. Overall, Mine is so terrible and boring. I will not recommend. Unless you want to see some poor performances, boring direction, and a dull script with annoying characters."

I actually only watched 5 minutes of this movie before I got convinced the story will not be a good one. WARNING! Small spoiler alert!A US soldier wouldn't shoot the target because it was during a wedding, not. I find that hard to believe, they'd even bomb a funeral or shoot some to save many.A spotter bugging his sniper to shoot the target. Maybe bugged once or twice but a spotter keeps bugging his sniper to shoot sounds ridiculous. If I was that sniper I'd hit the spotter with the rifle and tell him to shut up."

I see not a big problem here.The fundamental problem is insane, excruciating boredom of it. The guy basically stands on a mine for most of the length of the flick doing nothing but hallucinating. It is absolutely beyond any acceptable level, this is really Guantanamo-torture-level of boredom. Literally nothing happens for so long time that even the mine itself gives up.The movie is excruciatingly long, at almost two hour is absolutely unbearable. If the movie would be closer to one hour it might be somewhat acceptable, but let's be straight - this is story for a short movie. It is not thrilling, not exciting, just exhausting.If you want a way better drama about the guy who is stuck on a mine, try No Mans Land (2001) instead. Way way better movie!"

",-0.2732,-0.9715,2017-04-26 00:00:00,1,"Sorry but the main setup of the movie is fatally flawed. Mines don't go click and if yous step on one it doesn't do nothing until you step off of it, it goes off because once you step on it you will have tripped the mechanism that lights the fuse. It might not go off for a second or 2 depending on the timing of the mine but it will go off whether you keep walking or just stand on it.... So this fatal flaw is enough to make you stop watching after the first 10 minutes... Did we mention the ""sniper"" that has second thoughts about shooting the target because it happens to be a wedding? Again complete disregard for reality... a sniper that was trained and sent on a mission like this would never be some wussy that loses his nerve so again it just makes up stuff to make the story go where they wanted to go with it ignoring reality."

Then undo a bootlace, make a tourniquet that anchors his boot to the landmine (trigger), slip his foot out of boot while tightening the tourniquet (much better than using knife to anchor boot to landmine). Don't think they would have had an anti tapper device under the landmine (Area Denial Weapon).The worst time for landmines was at Afghanistan during and after CIA Operation Cyclone as the Defeat of the U.S.S.R. Occupation; they left Millions of landmines at Afghanistan of all kinds. In deserts (Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia) the wind causes the sand to shift enough so that you can see the landmines.This had to be happening at U.S. AFRICOM (Africa, not Afghanistan), as to why the Berber.

I did enjoy performance by Armie Hammer, i think its one of his very best yet. Some scenes were also nicely filmed and this isn't an action movie nor its really deep about survival - it is more of a psychological thriller. There were many flaws in this movie and creator didn't achieve what they probably intended to do, yet this is a watchable and not a bad film overall to see it once on a very boring evening."

" I Wish I'd Stepped On A Mine Instead
",0.4019,-0.9848,2017-04-06 00:00:00,2,"-Spoilers, but it'll help you save almost two hours.-Ughhh...Positives:I give the film two stars because the berber guy played by Clint Dyer is really likable. I'd rather have seen a film about him and his story by itself. They do some transitions between scenes/hallucinations that involve the main character Mike the sniper taking a step and then hearing a ""click"" like stepping on the mine as significant life events take place. Those transitions are really, really good. Too bad they didn't make a better film for them to be in.Negatives:Lore Sjoberg, professional sarcast, years ago coined what he calls ""The Law of Cinematic Inaccuracy"". ""Movies get everything wrong. Hacking-based movies are laughable to hackers, military-based movies are laughable to members of the armed forces, and Indiana Jones movies are laughable to archaeologists."" File this one in the military category.It's glaringly obvious they either didn't hire any military script adviser or they didn't listen to that adviser. To anyone who's served or even been around anyone who's served in any nation's armed forces, it's terrible.Marines don't call each other soldier, just like soldiers don't call each other ""marine"", and lawyers don't call each other ""plumbers"", and IT specialists don't call each other ""deep sea divers"".American military missions (by ground force elements, for those rare few who've read about what happened during Red Wings from military sources and not from media) also don't leave people with no comms, nor stranded in the desert by themselves with no air or ground support for days.They also have contingency plans, fallback points, rally points, recovery points, and so on. Missions (by ground force military elements) are not seat-of-your-pants things, especially as depicted in the film. The 5 Principles of Patrolling begins with ""Planning"".Desert survival involves wearing something to block the sun. Hats are thrown away for dramatic effect to show actors sweating. It's silly. Everyone who's been in any desert knows this.The generic ""mid-east"" war setting didn't bother me, but the fluff of people wandering through the desert to have a ""wedding"" was pretty lame. High value targets don't wander into dunes where air assets can spot them from 30 miles away, they shuffle around settlements.The whole setup for the initial sniping scene is preposterous, especially when they give us specific information the filmmakers don't understand. They give an exact range for the target Mike's sniping at well over 1000 yards. I seem to recall it's 1708 - nearly a mile (1.6km). When a glint of light reflecting from his scope is spotted (because his hide sucks and he doesn't run a tenebraex killflash or sunshade tube like everyone else has for decades), ragged terrorists start dumping rounds on them at 1700 yards... which is a very tough shot for a very good sniper, and well outside of the effective range of guys with AKs.The breakdown in discipline between the two ""friends"" and subsequent wandering into a minefield that's marked by a plot device sign landing literally at their feet is something that no one with discipline would ignore. But Mike the sniper and his friend do, and his friend gets his legs blown off for his troubles, which is the only scene I laughed at because the wagging stumps were somewhat limited technically, but mainly because it was so hackneyed and plainly stupid. There was zero subtlety, and the film failed with its intended mission there completely. It could've been a really disturbing moment, but because it was so front-loaded it came as a joke like Dead Meat in Hot Shots.Mike gets his buddy to calm down enough to hit himself up with the morphine that he carries...which ain't exactly standard issue. And then after some more war hackneyed war tropes play out, Mike is left in the desert standing on a mine by himself having heard the ""click"" movie mines make that real ones tend not to.From there, we get all the lazy hack writer crap you could stuff into the film, from having to save his girlfriend Jenny from 5 ""ranger/delta"" guys who apparently are not professionals but instead loud abusive drunks who go to bars in partial uniforms, fighting with his abusive dad/stepdad, watching his mom die, not knowing why he's fighting, yadda yadda.He gets stalked by the wolf from 300, he does a Bear Grylls and drinks his own urine, he has some more hallucinations, and it's just all around the kind of stuff you'd expect to see in this kind of movie that's trying to be smart but just can't make it.One of the highlights was the berber, but he rather quickly falls into becoming the trope of ""magic negro"" who helps the white man learn a valuable life lesson. If it were slightly less blatant, it would've worked better, but frankly I could see Clint Dyer carrying a whole film as the berber in a totally different kind of movie.The group I watched this with started calling out what would happen next, and by the end of the film, we had guessed pretty much the entire course of the movie, with the exception being the berber's interaction with mines.The very ending is a mess, but by that point you won't care anyway.In summary: if you want to make an intelligent, introspective look at humanity by trapping a character alone with their thoughts in a desperate situation, watch this first to see what errors to avoid. Otherwise, treat it like UXO and stay far away and call EOD to detonate it in place."
" Cheesy and clichéd
",0.0,0.4048,2017-04-06 00:00:00,5,"This movie is wayyy too long. I wanted to like it, but by the time the final 40 minutes came around, I found myself wishing he'd just take his damn foot off! First off, it's a bit of a daft story-line, the army just wouldn't abandon soldiers, sandstorms or not. Two days in one position and your leg would go numb. Hell... mine goes to sleep when I cross my legs for more than five minutes these days! I have a gripe about the casting of the black man, played by Clint Dyer (I know - who?). Why get an English actor, or for that matter an American to do the voice of an indigenous tribesman slash Nomad? Are there no actors who have a more suitable accent? It all adds to the realism. His accent was appalling and clichéd, almost comical. Well, a few things happen over the next two days (and boy does it seem every minute of 48 hours). It feels as though the movie has genuinely been that long by the end. By the time you get to the retrospective look at our hero's past, you genuinely want him to just get on with it, it just goes on and on and on. Then the painful drawn out end is just too much. I found myself just wanting the movie to stop before I broke something. I think I started to lose focus around 43 minutes in. It's always a bad sign when you are looking at how long is left and an even worse one when you can remember the exact time you looked afterwards. The whole movie was just over the top, like the music and swelling orchestral accompaniment, which shouts 'I want you to be moved' instead of the film and events actually moving you. The movie is easily summed up as: man steps on mine, man steps off mine - the end. There is no more substance to it unfortunately. A lot more interesting things could have happened. The acting is fine, but how hard is it to play such an unchallenging role? The end is a bit unsatisfactory as well, it can be seen coming a mile off, so that is a further letdown. I wouldn't view this a second time if I had free tickets. I have more things to do with my life, like chewing my own arm off, or sticking pins in my eyes - both of which would be more pleasurable."
" Dangerously Incorrect Information
",-0.4588,-0.9751,2017-04-06 00:00:00,1,"No matter how engaging the media is, the message perceived is potentially dangerous . I have managed landmine clearance operations professionally for more than 15 years and will categorically state that the situation postulated in this movie is ridiculous. Ordnance does not function like this. Why have something moving twice (down when you step on it and then what? Up, maybe?), when it is much easier to build a resilient fuze that requires only one input (2-8kgs pressure down for most pressure initiated anti-personnel mines). No landmines work like this movie insists! A 'click' mine is a fictitious and dangerous Hollywood construct.Hollywood has created a non-existent threat and unlike aliens, vampires or fairies, this danger has potential, real World impact on the people that live with explosive remnants of war (ERW) on a daily basis.How do you think people in conflict zones get most of their safety and behavioural programming? It's certainly not from the war mongering parties! In Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan and other war-torn nations, people are watching this sort of drivel and then hoping to use it to keep their children safe.I am all for entertainment; one step further - I am all for fanciful entertainment, but this movie postulates (hopefully) unknowing misinformation that can kill people. Is that still acceptable?If our media creates entertainment, but implies that this is reality, then the important technical details must also be realistic. I consider the lack of technical realism to be irresponsible and potentially dangerous, in this instance."

",0.2247,0.957,2017-04-05 00:00:00,7,"I won't lie, the start of the movie was pretty dull and slow and a little over the top with the military theme. But once it gets to the actual conflict of the movie; two thumbs up!I really liked the physiological aspect and what the main character is wrestling with in his own mind. Very human and that was the best part of the movie.Armie Hammer is a talented actor with his brooding persona. It was a little much at first but he pulled it together incredibly well for the rest of the movie.Glad I found it. Go check it out!"
" Pretty solid.
",0.5859,0.4918,2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Not going to lie or give out any false promises with this review.Personally I hate movies that are based around a select few characters, because the movie then has to perform some spectaculer tense scenes to gain my interest. That being said, this is not one of those select few.. Amazing powerful performance's from Armie Hammer and Clint Dyer, Tom Cullen's character did annoy me at the start but then gradually became interesting. With the likes of The Hurt Locker I personally preferred MINE as I found locker boring as hell.I was kinda wondering which out of the two will hit Cinemas this Month, Mine and/or The Wall {John Cena}I know these are 2 different movies but I found myself comparing this to a Hurt Locker meets Frozen {2010 Thriller} but in the Desert.The emotional and tense flash-backs make this a worth while viewing, and the twist at the end was pretty unexpected.8/10"
" Nice movie
",0.4215,0.9865,2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed watching this movie, the script it's pretty solid and original and everything seems well done in all the details. Directors have done a good job keeping you stuck on the chair mixing some thriller / survival stuff with a background dramatic story that sometime spotted out giving more deep to the character. Well directed and well edited , with some shoots loop (the foot that step in making a ""click"" as it's touching a mine) or Armie that kneel down in different time and story spacing that bring some focus on what it's going to happen and linked all the story together. I enjoyed also how the directors gave us more information and the background story about the soldier and it's inner conflicts. Nice photography and environment too, with some cool shoots to watch. If you consider that on this movie there is less than 7 actors..and you really don't miss anything it means that they have done a good job. I was really surprised by Armie Hammer that he's playing the main character..he produces a really good interpretation really believable ,maybe better when he's in the desert than at home in his normal life. Really a good interpretation. Also i was surprised by the visual effects.. really good and that's why the movie it nominated for David's Donatello award. The only thing i found a bit silly...a marine never put himself in front of sun with a rifle scope..simply because it could reflects the light and make you detected..as it is in the movie..so maybe it's a bit silly. A nice movie that bring some more interesting stuff than just a survival movie as other similar, so if you want just to watch an action movie this isn't the right one, but if you want to watch something between action drama and thriller it's the right one and that's why i really enjoyed to watch it."
" Psychological thriller!!!
",0.3129,0.9291,2017-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Mike is returning to the base camp after a failed mission. Accidentally he puts his left foot on a land mine. If he moves, it will explode. Help is on the way, Will he survive??? It's a psychological thriller movie and it was very effective in that manner. A remarkable performance from Armie Hammer and all the supporting actors did justice to their roles, especially the British actor Clint Dyer. Overall, If you like the concept, just go for it."
