" Overhyped
",0.0,-0.9355,2021-03-14 00:00:00,4,"Too long, too little action. Fight choreography is too messy and uncinematic. Gangs of London, also from Gareth Evans, has much better fights in comparison.The people giving this 10 stars can only have limited experience with action movies.
I like my Action bloody and fast, but this is not it.
I don't care for any characters and have no idea what the hell is going on in the stiry. It's a confusing mess."
" The Raid 2 is every bit as good, if not better, than the first film, and explodes with energy after every build up, turning the action to another wildly chaotic level
",-0.1546,0.9861,2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,"The Raid 2 follows up The Raid: Redemption with masterful action sequences and excellent cinematography, building upon the first film's plot with a much more detailed narrative, thus the lengthy duration.Relentless with its action sequences, the Raid 2 does not run out of frenzied characters out for blood after every short plot build-up and development of the protagonist's circumstances, providing for intense, no holds barred clashes, all while maintaining a well-executed choreography that keeps the adrenaline running until the next sequence. The story really does well to add more emotion and motive to the characters to keep tensions high, leading to a very thrilling climax.Gareth Evans played his cards well. Though criminally underrated, the Raids 1 and 2 proves that a talented cast, dedicated production crew, and a creative director with a focused vision, trumps that of any major motion picture from Hollywood with big names and a big budget but has a hollow script and sloppy execution.As an interesting side, it's pretty cool to see the inspiration that the John Wick trilogy takes from The Raid and even have some of the actors from the main cast join the third John Wick film as well."

",0.5574,0.9884,2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,"All the action is purposeful and brutal, the characters are riveting, the ending is almost perfect, but the third act as a whole has some of the best action sequences I've ever seen (kitchen scene).
The way the camera moves so seamlessly traps the viewer in the moment and it's all so thrilling, sophisticated, and well fleshed out.
This is truly a must see for any action fan, and a brilliant addition to what the first Raid movie was, plain and simple. This... no this is the lobster right after the appetizer, my friends"

" Expansion
",0.0,-0.5986,2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,"The title might be confusing, but that is precisely what Berendal does. It expands the scope of The Raid yet keeps most of the charm of the first installment.By themselves, both movies are very good, 8+ stars and definitely among the best action movies ever made. They're visceral, brutal and even interactive at times since most viewers might feel their bones creak with some especially nasty blows.Why did i rate this movie a 10? Because it is a proper ""Expansion and continuation"" of the story, making The Raid: Redemption more of a prologue to the main story taking place in Berendal. Going further, Berendal actually gives us the big players who made the story of Redemption actually take place. -Deduction- Tama (Bad guy boss) is basically loosely subordinated or affiliated to at least Reza (Pimp cane guy) and probably a former subordinate of Bangun (Big boss). Reza in turn sent the corrupt cop to raid the apartment building as both a threat and message of payment.
This is where our protagonist Rama comes into play - The raid actually succeeded due to his and his brother's actions, but since both the corrupt cop and Tama went down, Reza didn't get what he wanted and started taking out loose ends. Rama's brother gets executed, and Rama himself has no choice but to go undercover for the detective in order to protect his identity and his family.It's pretty much a flawless transition which brings us from an event (the raid) into the big league criminal world.Berendal itself is quite differently executed as compared to Redemption, as it has no sense of constant urgency but focuses much more on world building, character development and personal relations/choices. The action is there for sure, but it comes in big and small chunks with breathing room in between.
Berendal is almost exhausting to watch, as there is even more brutality and a LOT more injustice taking place as compared to Redemption.All in all, Berendal is a top-notch movie, but it diverges a bit from Redemption with its big open world, fleshed out characters and no sense of urgency. I think it was the proper way to go as it feels like the stakes are raised bigtime."

Iko Uwais once again gives an incredibly committed lead performance and Arifin Putra and Alex Abbad are both great.

" Brutal, cruel, evisceral, remarkable.....
",-0.836,-0.6573,2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,"Indonesian action film seems to be in competition with itself for he title of most violent films on the planet.""The Raid 2"" is no exception. Like many Indonesian counterparts its brutally violent and bloody. By no means, a film for everyone, even those who like wall to wall action.The pacing of this film is frenetic and the choreography amazing. The fight scenes mix very pratical street combat with larger than life spectacle in a variety of environments, each with the own benefits and limitations. Layers of opponents attack, offering the opportunity for some very creative use of hand and foot, wrestling and weapons, conventional and unconventional.Indeed, its the experimentally brutal and eviscerally cruel fight scenes that define this film but that's not to say, its all that defines it. Acting is solid and the back story whilst predictable is done convincingly. Cinamatogrpahy is also top shelf and its accompanied by occasional but appropriate, sound tracks.All in all a real winner ""if"" you can stomach the violence which even had me wincing at times.8/10."

" The anticipated sequel to The Raid comes an action/crime epic, a masterpiece in cinema
",0.6249,0.9977,2020-06-17 00:00:00,10,"The anticipated sequel to The Raid, and here comes an as brutal film filled with spectacular action and fight sequences but also a superb story. It begins straight after the events of the first film and the next chapter has Rama undercover in a prison to gain information on a Kingpin to take him down inside the organization. It's not a very original story but it works and continues to be interesting, just something that never gets old. I didn't really think the characters would be so good, seriously great written. Of course Rama being the favorite but Uco is a close second. The larger length of the movie made it so there could be a much more deeper story and drama, fantastic drama.The fight choreography, just that alone makes this movie re-watchable, it's beyond amazing. How all the hand-to-hand combat was real says something how awesome this movie is, the actors and stunt performers really did some great work and should get praise for it as it is incredible. It's a very talented crew of filmmakers, the cinematography and camera work are one of many highlights. Just visually pleasing. Gareth Evans is once again the writer, director and producer and he Ups his game. The musical score is something worth mentioning, it's perfect and flows well with the fight scenes. It's better than the previous film's. The editing, just wow.There are many memorable and brilliant fight sequences, varying from small to large. Here's some that I liked the most.
* Prison Yard Fight: it was almost too brutal but how it was shot was beautiful in a sense and then the killing began and it continued to be shot so beautiful with it looking if not it being a one take. The set was amazing and how every little detail matter like the fence and mud. Pure perfection. Memorable.
* Vehicle Fight: From a technical standpoint I have no idea how they pulled it off, can't have been on a real road but it looks like it. Inside a 4 seated car, has to be impossible to choreograph but guess what they did and that whole sequence is another reason to re-watch this movie.
* Hallway and Kitchen Fight: Iko Uwais is the star of this franchise and it shows in these two scenes, he kicks serious ass and the martial arts he's using is so satisfying to watch. The hallway fight after the warehouse has Rama against Hammer Girl and Baseball Guy, that's so comic booky but it works as it's entertaining. It was amazing, seeing him taking on then alone as he worked together with his brother in the previous movie to take on an overpowered foe. Directly after comes one of the best yet, the kitchen fight. It's a love letter to martial art movies, in a way in looking at the start of it then it grows into a 1v1 brutal fight. It's truly a fascinating and entertaining fight, re-watchable and its possibly one of the best fight scenes I have seen."

" Back and forth
",0.0,0.3814,2020-05-19 00:00:00,9,"This was supposed to be the original The Raid movie. If you are not aware of the story, it is worth listening to (and you'll find a lot of behind the scenes stuff about that and how the lack of money before had an impact). But now we're here and Iko Uwais has to carry this movie. And while I do like him and I think he is quite the action star - I also think he really crumbless a bit under the weight of it all.So I was quite torn between an 8 and a 9. But decided in the end to go for a 9. Because there is quite the intriguing story, but also the action is quite phenomenal. So even with the lead not quite being there for the story (in my humble opinion), everything else works amazing. Don't expect this to be as action packed as the first one was. A bit of patience, but also downfalls when it comes to characters and story has to be there.When it comes to the action though ... bone crunching is a thing right? Like a literal thing. You can't be squeamish about these things. It will get brutal and the camera will not shy away from the violence. The way it is choreographed alone would have deserved a full point rating (see my dilemma again?). Gareth Evans is quite the talent when it comes to choreography and action related cinema. When given time and money he can create extraordinary things ... ""one"" of them being the Raid movies. Highly recommendable"
" The 'Terminator 2' of its series.
",0.0,0.7584,2020-05-18 00:00:00,8,"'The Raid 2 (2014)' is to 'The Raid (2011)' what 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)' is to 'The Terminator (1984)': bigger, bolder and about the same in terms of quality. The piece is undeniably larger than its predecessor - in scale, scope, ambition and, even, run-time - but it could be argued that the efficiency and purity of vision of that same predecessor has been somewhat lost. Instead of an unrelenting, pulse-pounding survival movie, this is a sweeping crime epic told through the lens of an undercover cop drama. Its protagonist, Rama, gets sort of lost during its midsection, treading water amidst a sea of crooks, killers and corrupt cops. He doesn't have all that much impact on the plot, outside of the finale, but he's still a compelling character for the audience to root for. At its core, the film is still an action flick. Along with its crime drama trappings, it does, of course, have plenty of brutal, balletic and brilliantly choreographed action. Some of this stuff must have been a nightmare to shoot, but it makes for some spectacular set-pieces. The fight sequences are all exciting, energetic and impactful. The finale, especially, makes excellent use of escalating tension and visual storytelling as our hero fights his way towards the big bad in one last attempt to finish things off. It's great stuff, enthralling and suspenseful. Though the film as a whole isn't quite as effective as its predecessor, it's still one of the best action movies in recent memory. Although the story sometimes gets in its own way, it's still an engaging and entertaining vehicle for the flick's fighting. In fact, it's clear that story came first in this case, leading to a holistic and satisfying experience that should keep you hooked throughout. 8/10"

" ACTION MOVIE 101
",0.0,0.382,2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,"I have seen many action movies and martial arts movies come and go in my 30+ years of viewing experience. This is my mind is easily in my top 3 martial arts movies of all time.The action is introduced early on but only get a glimpse, a taste, an appetizer. Throughout the movie the action ramps up culminating to a flurry of beautifully choreographed mayhem. The action and the fight scenes are not for the faint of heart either. You hear bones breaking, you see bones breaking, you see blood splattering everywhere, and the brutality unlike many movies feels real because the shots are up close and personal. No guy getting blown up or crushed by a bus dozens of feet away, you are there, and it looks excruciating.The fight scenes, the cinematography, the story is beautifully done to create a masterpiece of chaos. The movie is almost 2 and a half hours long, but it doesn't feel like it. Every scene dives deeper into the realm of danger that is Rama's life. Ever deeper the plot thickens, ever more the action escalates. The villains are well done, but are not the main source of Rama's problems.Mad Dog, Hammer girl and bat boy are martial arts dynamos who get their own appearances and ability to showcase their brand of style and prowess before the face-off with Rama. This serves as an appetizer and a sense of just how dangerous they can be and gives question to how is it gonna play out. They serve as the agents of evil for the madmen who lead them. Unlike other movies, the martial art baddies lean more on the side of fists to the highest bidder. You know they work for the bad guys, but you get the sense and feel that they work for whoever can get them the most challenge, the most to pit their wits and might against.The movie never feels drawn out, or too long. You only get the sense of questioning how much more carnage can be squeezed out, and it never flutters. By the time the movie is done you feel as if only just moments before hit the brakes.The action sequences are the thing of legend and serve as a tool to learn from. The amount of time between various angle shots and image breaks is long. The camera work and choreography for the fights took many months and it shows. You have real martial artists as actors, and it shows. Very much like having Jackie Chan, Tony Jaa, Jet Li, Bruce Lee, and other titans in the game, you have more chances of them not only performing their own stunts but also wanting to showcase their abilities by being part of the choreograph team. It takes a director such as Evens to be able to maximize runtime between cuts by doing some interesting camera work only seen by those who directors who truly love fight scenes.This movie focuses on the brutality and the relentless focus that is one man's quest to doing his mission and getting back to his family.2 and a half hours of brilliance, beauty and utter destruction. Thank you to everyone involved in the making of this gem, it will remain one of my top 3 martial arts films for the foreseeable future and will certainly take a great deal of effort to knock it off that list.
I challenge directors to make martial arts movies this good. Keep it coming"
" Note to Hollywood, this is how you do a fight scene
",-0.3818,-0.4215,2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,I watch it because of Cecep Arif Rahman. I believe this movie is the best fighting movie I ever watched. There is nothing I need to say more. Just go and watch it. Exept watch carefully last fight. There is no CGI there is no effect. Everything is feels real.

Is there a Interesting Plot ? No.
Interesting Characters ? No
Even the lead Actor has no charisma at all and then the runtime 150 Minutes !!! There is no Reason for this , It's Overlong , dull and Boring. The Driector fools his audiences with Gore , annoying Characters and a uncharismatic Lead Actor. The Raid 2 is nowhere Close to ""One of the Best Action Movies of all Time"".

" Bigger, better, more brutal, and practically perfect!
",0.3609,-0.9589,2020-04-16 00:00:00,10,"'The Raid 2' is a richly enthralling crime saga punctuated by extraordinary action that's as elegant as it is savage.Taking place immediately after the first film, it doesn't take long before a criminal underworld is established and Rama must go undercover for his family's safety. In doing so, he risks all, as he begins another terrifying odyssey of violence.Primed to quench anyones bloodlust with its onslaught of furious brutality, this Indonesian action thriller is unbelievable at times. It's seriously awards-worthy stuff, and particular mention must go to Gareth Evans' masterful direction who is in complete control of his craft, aswell as the inventive cinematography - every fight is expertly designed and executed, lingering with many long takes, and letting you relish in the thick of combat, which is a testament to all involved.This time it trades the grimy corridors of a drug-infested apartment block for a city of sordid corruption. Warehouse dens of criminals and mud-soaked prison environs are the playground for a series of ultra-violent set-pieces in this sequel; a film that manages to surpass the original for stylish choreography and gory kills. And once again Iko Uwais is the leading man, dishing out a brutal barrage of hurt to low-life scum adept at martial arts.This is a long film, but it earns its length, never squandering a minute. Fleshing out its corrupt world is first and foremost on Evans' mind, and the characters that inhabit it are given enough content to become an integral piece of the puzzle. And like any martial arts film, there are more than just the ordinary, disposable villains. Several of them can be best described as ""boss"" villains, and they serve to make life difficult for our persevering protagonist. They each come with their own unique skillset to mix things up, such as Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man (self-explanatory), who are given sufficient, entertaining screen time. But no one is a match for Rama, whose fists in hand-to-hand combat are as lethal as any gun or blade, and the last hour is chock full of demonstrations of his talent.This is as good as action gets, and the level of skill on display is evident everywhere you look. Gareth Evans presents another masterpiece of filmmaking, and it's as bloody as it is brilliant."
" Ballet of death. Give me John Wick anyday.
",-0.5994,-0.9708,2020-03-09 00:00:00,6,"The simple premis of The Raid was one of it's main strengths. A group of cops are trapped in a residential tower block where all the residents are trying to kill them and they must fight their way out. Simple. Not really a plot at all, just a situation to hang non stop fights on. The sequel however substitutes the simple premis of the first movie with a rather complicated and incoherent plot punctuated by some of the most gratuatous movie violence I have ever seen. It makes Quentin Tarrantino look like a Disney movie. It was all a bit too much for my taste and because of the tortuous plot it is way overlong at 2 1/2 hours. While it is technically spectacular the fight scenes looked a little too staged and over choreographed, like a ballet of death. Give me John Wick any day."

While some scenes can get long after a while, this sequel is in several ways superior to the first movie, like in terms of quality production. And sometimes, you'd just wish that I'd never stop. And Iko Uwais gives another good lead performance. Overall, this gory and entertaining action flick has got to be in the list of the best action pics ever made. Recommended !!"
" Great
",0.6249,-0.8063,2020-02-22 00:00:00,9,"It is hard to believe but this movie is bigger AND better than the first one. I will say it has ambition in opening up this world into a mafia drama rather than another claustrophobic thrill-ride. The mob aspect of the plot might be generic and cliched at times but overall that part was surprisingly more engaging than some American movies of that kind. But we watch this for the action and it was insanely savage! We are talking level-11 sh-t here; high-speed pacing, masterful choreography and brutal as hell. Fight sequences that put most action movies to shame!!

" A must see sequal
",0.0,0.6849,2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Having seen The Raid, I didn't lose a moment to get stuck into this sequal.Can only repeat as I thought for the first film. Great fight scenes, an actual plot, dubious over-dubbing in to English.It really is a breath of fresh air to take away the pomp and lack of imagination of Hollywood to see a movie so well crafted with a progressive plot and amazing action and shooting style.Must say (and not going to describe to avoid spoilers), there were some unique concepts in fight scenes in this 2nd film.I you like all out action and well choreographed fight scenes, this is for you."
" An Action Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9423,2020-02-02 00:00:00,10,"I think this is the best action film ever made. It's certainly the best one I've ever seen. Being a fan of the John Wick world, I was led to The Raid franchise through a friend recommendation. And what a pair of action films they are. The Raid is excellent and The Raid 2 is even better. It's scope is larger and the plot is deeper and the characters more fleshed out. Rama by the way is a great character. Easily likable. He's really somebody you root for, like John Maclean from the Die Hard films. This time Rama is sent undercover into the criminal underworld to expose a conspiracy, posing as an aspiring thug. There's not much more to the plot than that, and acting is serviceable at best. But nobody watches these movies for the acting. You watch them for the action sequences, and the action in The Raid 2 is in a class of it's own. It has fight scenes that are just spectacular. They are frenetic, creative,
and bloody. They're also filmed with an old school clarity. The cameras seem to remain steady with plenty of wide takes so you can see every blow. No jump cuts or ridiculous camera shaking to hide deficiencies in the choreography, like the actors being to old or too untrained to actually do this stuff. These actors all seem to know what they're doing, and it's filmed with clarity for the audience to see. I think The Raid 2 is a blueprint for how action should be filmed. There has been talk of a third installment, but I don't know how you would improve on part 2. I haven't seen an action film better than this."

",0.3384,-0.6232,2019-10-03 00:00:00,5,"It really is kinda weird thinking of this violent film as entertainment. And yet, it is. I'll be honest, there were quite a few scenes I did not enjoy due to the graphic nature of the violence.'The Raid 2' follows directly on the first film. However, it is completely different. The film lacks the originality of the first film in the sense that it is not as unique. It also doesn't have the level of suspense the first film had and the killings in the first film were more appropriate and acceptable. The police in the 'The Raid' were literally fighting for their lives, whereas 'The Raid 2' has killings left, right and center purely for the thrill of it (I suppose...). I also miss the thumping music that added to the adrenaline rush of the first film. This film is also much longer, and therefore slower moving. Be warned, this film is definitely not for everyone, as it is insanely violent. Some scenes were almost unwatchable due to the brutality. In many instances, I found it unnecessarily gory and graphic.Having said this, 'The Raid 2' is an exceptionally well made film. It is stunningly photographed with great cinematography. The fight sequences are incredibly well choreographed and probably the best fighting scenes you will ever see (for a while, at least). The chase scene towards the end was AMAZING!! The film's conclusion will also leave you satisfied. This is indeed a movie experience and not just another movie."

Nothing else comes close. Iko should be the number one action star in the world soon. Can't go wrong with this movie. Also watch Headshot, The RAID Redemption, and The Night Comes for Is. the last one mentioned is probably the goriest move as far as action films go."
" Incredible: 10
",0.0,0.9708,2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"2012's The Raid was one of the most efficient action films ever made, eschewing deep characters and story in favor of numerous action sequences. And the only reason it was made was because the writer/director, Gareth Evans, was unable to secure funding for his first-choice project. As it turns out, The Raid 2 was that project. After the success of the first one, and a few story changes to integrate the surviving characters into the previously-standalone work, Evans has finally made the movie he always wanted. And it shows. The Raid 2 is superior to the first in almost every way. The story is far more intricate this time, a tale of two major crime syndicates teetering on the brink of war. The action scenes have been enhanced as well, bigger in scale than anything in the first movie, and considerably more brutal. Suffice it to say that the squeamish need not apply. The Raid 2 is better written, better acted, and better filmed than The Raid, and is the best action film I have seen in recent memory. I will be very, very surprised if The Raid 2 doesn't end up in the list of my top three movies of 2014."

Starring: Iko Uwais, Yayan Ruhian, Julie Estelle, Cecep Arif Rahman, et al...
Rating: 5 out of 10 (brain turned on)
Second rating: 7.5 out of 10 (brain turned off)Let me preface this review by saying that I do feel bad for giving this film a 5 out of 10. So, to be fair to it, I'm giving it a secondary review with my brain turned off. With that out of the way, shall we get started? The Raid 2 is all about a police officer who goes undercover but gets way in over his head. It is supposed to be a brief job but instead it turns into a 2+ year endeavor.The film poster's tagline of ""One of the greatest action movies ever made"" is no exaggeration. Seriously. In terms of action sequences, set pieces, and choreography, The Raid 2 is top tier. The character acting in this also makes these things more believable and intense. The soundtrack and design of it also adds a layer of depth. Unfortunately, the movie is bogged down by logical inconsistencies and plot holes that kind of take you out of it.While watching the movie. There were multiple instances of events that occur that make you question the legitimacy of things. One of the biggest flaws in my opinion was the crime organizations lack of firearm usage. They obviously have the means and capability to use guns. But, refuse to do so on a consistent basis. It's not like guns do not exist in the movie Universe. There are a couple scenes where they are employed. So my question is why not just have them throughout the movie?The plot of the movie is also not that believable. Here you have a story about a police officer who goes undercover but gets in over his head. Once starts hitting the fan, why doesn't the main character just quit the force and leave? The main character even brings this question up. His identity is safe and his family is safe, so why not just go? He has plenty of evidence to bring down this crime syndicate. But, no his Handler is just like ""oh well we need to get them on corruption charges"". Seriously man? Come on.Finally, the film clocks in at 2 hour and 30 minutes. Boy, do you feel that too. While watching the movie I found myself just waiting for the next fight scene. To be honest, I did not care about the story or plot because it was that bad. There are plenty of movies out there that are long. Ive seen plenty where they suck you in and you don't feel the time pass. This one however drags on. While yes The Raid 2 has phenomenal action, it has all of these other elements that make it lack luster. You are honestly better off watching all of the action scenes on YouTube."

",0.0,-0.968,2019-06-25 00:00:00,4,"Just wasn't as good as the original. Had some awesome fighting again and some great directing in both the fight and non-fight scenes. and it was visually beautiful. But the story tried to be too complex and just wasn't good. it was almost completely useless to me. there weren't really any characters that stood out like in the first one. the music wasn't as good. i gave it a second chance. it is just way too long and boring. it EASILY could have been 40 minutes shorter, maybe even an hour (2 viewings)
SPOILERS
tried to be like the departed with the undercover story and the second undercover revealing who he was before he died, and I called it when he said ""we come from the same place."" I thought the way it ended was stupid with him saying I'm done . It seemed to have a lot of things and never came into play like the second undercover telling him it would never end and saying that he was stuck there forever, him not trusting his handler, and it was so confusing to have an entirely new character played by the same actor as the main villain who died at the end of the first movie. I kept thinking maybe they were showing something from the past. and that entire story-line was completely irrelevant to the story. they tried to give him a backstory with an ex-wife that won't let him see his son. he was introduced an hour into the movie and ended up dying not too long after. but not before adding like 20 minutes of useless story to the movie."

" The most highly anticipated film of my life
",0.0,-0.5773,2019-05-24 00:00:00,9,"Note: Check me out as the ""Asian Movie Enthusiast"" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) (Indonesian Action).Viewed on March 28th at the Regal E-Walk cinema in the heart of New York City.After surviving the apartment building raid, Iko Uwais goes undercover to take down an Indonesian crime syndicate that is feuding with an invasive Japanese yakuza clan in Jakarta. Things get out of control and everything goes to hell. That's the plot in a nutshell.The fighting is the main draw of this film. Martial arts films are frequently under-appreciated because critics tend to downplay the artistry of orchestrating a fight sequence. In some ways it's like staging a complex dance with extremely difficult performances by physical talents who have spent their entire lives perfecting their craft. In many cases it can be even more challenging than executing a good dramatic moment. With that said, ""The Raid 2"" is an exquisite ballet of death with an incredible variety of expertly crafted action sequences that have a grounded, realistic feel to them. It's hard to describe, but despite the insane action there's very little outrageousness present. The choreography here is some of the best ever put on film.There is no question that Uwais is currently the premiere martial arts star, and there is certainly no question that Gareth Evans is the greatest action director on the planet. This man is a genius in terms of visually expressing action through vivid, mind-blowing camera-work. This guy never directed a car chase sequence in his life, and yet his very first attempt is impressive. I did notice a bit more shaky cam in this film when compared to its predecessor, but one can see everything so it's not a problem. Evans is also a pro to create a crescendo of action where every fight seems to outdo the one before it. This generates an absolutely thrilling final hour that will go down in history.The gory violence of ""The Raid 2"" is a big ""screw you"" to PG-13 action movies. Some critics are already whining about the graphic bloodletting, but these are the same guys who hand out 90% approval ratings to movies with incompetent action and no edge - *cough* ""The Hunger Games 2: Catching Fire"" (2013) *cough*. The gore in ""The Raid 2"" isn't just randomly thrown in either. It's a logical consequence of the situation and characters, and it is applied in very creative ways. I have heard that Evans was only coerced to cut a few ""frames"" due to the MPAA review, but I have no idea which frames those were because the now infamous shotgun kill is present in its full, unadulterated glory.The $4.5 million budget is an even bigger ""screw you"" to mega budget Hollywood blockbusters. ""The Raid 2"" has more thrilling action than every $100+ million superhero movie I've ever seen . . . at less than 4.5% of the cost. It's almost unbelievable what these guys can do with a limited budget.Given the exceptional quality of the action, the 148-minute runtime puts some pressure on the story to maintain its momentum between the violence. The first ""Raid"" received much criticism that asserted a generic story and undeveloped characters, but I felt that it nevertheless established a ""feel"" for the characters without the need for long-winded exposition. That ""feel"" can add quite a bit to an action film. ""The Raid 2"" spends more time setting up its premise, which results in some genuine plot and character development. It attempts to do this by taking a generic gangster template and infusing it with a sprawling crime saga that implements many characters. This is essentially a ""chess board"" setup where numerous pieces are first put into place, allowing for many possible confrontations. The viewer is therefore able to relish the moment when a particular piece attacks and takes down another, revealing the actual outcome amidst the countless possibilities.I really liked some of the supporting characters in this, and actually felt a bit sad when they died (even some of the villains!). I am a bit disappointed that both ""Hammer Girl"" and Baseball Bat Man"" are only given a few scenes, but they are certainly memorable. I really liked that brief moment where Hammer Girl picked up her hammers on the bar shelf. It was slightly child-like and innocent, like she was going out to play with friends. This brief, split-second moment can communicate a lot about her character.I suppose it helps to already be a fan of the actors and actresses here, since there are a number of familiar faces from both Indonesian and Japanese film industries. Needless to say, the performances are top notch. The Japanese actors have their little moments, but they could have been given more to do in this. Maybe ""The Raid 3"" will give them more time in the spotlight.Overall, ""The Raid 2"" is a very satisfying action film that justifies its hype after just one viewing. It's simply spectacular."

Very clever in the way the film starts, just as the previous movie ends. although some of the actors have obviously aged in between; it does not distract from some of the best fight sequences committed to the screen . 'The Raid 1 and 2' make for the best pop-corn double feature, unless you are put-off by loads of tomato ketchup and ultra violence. Like 'Kill Bill' x 100."

I cannot recommend enough that you watch the Original Language Version instead of the English Dubbed version (although this recommendation stands for every movie if you cannot understand the native tongue).Part prison flick, part gangland flick, part redemption film - The Raid 2 is definitely worth the watch and will no doubt leave you searching for more films of similar ilk."

" Awesome sequel with excellent action and fight scenes
",0.7351,0.9935,2018-08-25 00:00:00,9,"The Raid 2 is completely different to The Raid and there are things different about this film to the first one. There's a lot more characters in The Raid 2 to The Raid and the film has an excellent cast with excellent acting by Iko Uwais as Rama, Arifin Putra as Uco, Tio Pakusadewo as Bangun, Oka Antara as Eka, Alex Abbad as Bejo and Yayan Ruhian as Prakoso. This film has a lot more Brutal violence, tense action, car chases and excellent fight scenes and this is what makes this film an awesome sequel. The fight scenes in this film are excellent, incredible and very powerful. When I watched The Raid, I loved it and thought it was excellent but The Raid 2 was also awesome but there were only some minor faults to this film. Yayan Ruhian who acted as Prakoso and as Mad Dog in the first film could have been used better in The Raid 2 and there could have been a better fight scene using him. Yayan Ruhian is very strong and has got excellent skills in the Indonesian Martial Art Pencak Silat and if a better fight scene was done making him using his powerful strength and awesome fight moves, It would have been awesome. Although the film The Raid was a bit too violent such as when the character The Hammer Girl used her hammer and strength to attack people on the train, the film The Raid 2 was a big step up from the the first film. Iko Uwais was awesome as Rama and his fights against bad guys in this film was also absolutely brilliant. This film is an awesome film and I do recommend it if you have only seen the first film The Raid."
" This ties directly to my review of THE RAID, REDEMPTION.
",0.0,-0.5753,2018-08-13 00:00:00,8,"These films are brutally and disturbingly violent, but at the same time they are immensely watchable. The violence is portrayed in a lyrical way, almost artful, like a ballet. Not unlike the early films of John Woo, such as FACE OFF. The violence doesn't distract from the story telling, but enhances it, like Shakespeare did with his tragedies MACBETH, or HAMLET. The films are extremely well shot and very entertaining."
" One of the best action movies around
",0.6369,0.9863,2018-06-29 00:00:00,10,"As it stands, I think the Raid films are the best modern action films out right now. Where the first movie felt like one very long fight scene (which wasn't a bad thing), this one went bigger and took its time to create a meaningful story for the characters. With the story I began to realize that this movie's plot had multiple themes. It took its time to touch on issues of gang violence and politics, family, and blind ambition. Some of these themes can make for some really uncomfortable sequences but I believe the actors gave good performances despite what they had to do.The fights are even better here than they were in The Raid: Redemption. One major gripe I had with the first film was that the action would sometimes feel too ""choreographed"". In other words, Rama, the main protagonist, would be fighting his way through a hallway full of goons and he would always know when and how to turn a corner to take down the next guy. In the interest in showing the vulnerability of the hero as well as general realism, extended fight scenes should not always play out to the main guy's favor as he/she should become more reactive than proactive to survive. This, to me, is especially true in cases like this, where our hero is almost always outnumbered. This is something that this movie improves on because there were multiple occasions where I could see how susceptible to fatal wounds Rama really was, despite the main character immunity he may have sometimes. He wasn't necessarily setting the pace for the fights with his fighting expertise, but rather reacting to each and every strike in his (and ours) hopes to survive.The filmmakers for the Raid movies really seem to have a passion for action, which is awesome. Not only do they know how to shoot these sequences well, along with the fact that the actors didn't have stunt doubles, the fights always mean something. Whether its setting the tone for the next part of the story or showing the audience a glimpse of a certain character's true nature, my eyes were glued to the screen for every second of those sequences.The John Wick movies are the only contender to this film and it's predecessor. Asian action films centered around martial arts are always going to beat American ones because that style of action is deeply rooted in the culture. Despite some of the fancy camerawork in The Raid 2 (slowmos and unique angles), the close quarter combat is always the focus when it comes up. The filmmakers didn't rely on music to set the pace or excessive CGI coupled with stunt doubles to depict killing blows. Yes I'm a sucker for good action movies and this is most likely my favorite one yet."
" Greatest sction period but is a bit over the top and lacks honor or loyalty
",0.9306,0.9259,2018-06-25 00:00:00,6,"If you looking for the coolest fight scenes and action you have seen on a movie look no further then the raid. Sadly no Silat masters near me:)
 I will always be an advocate for raid 1 but raid 2 and the whole syndicate stuff was a bit over the top. Raid 1 didn't have a whole lot of story but you could bond with a swat officer going to do some bad stuff but in the end of the day just wanting to get home to his wife and kids and have reconciliation with his brother. Tremendous action baby. Second one took it up a notch for better and for worse. The fight scenes and stunts were all the more BA and creative but it sort of ended there for me. They just wanted to so out do the first one which I say they did, but they had to take like the cgi gore spatting in the camera from a good amount to like 300: rise of an empire level gore.. that coupled with the constant betrayals and deceit and treatment of women, and literal slitting of throats randomly was never ending without a break. Look I know that happens, but have a little better pacing like raid 1 or else it gets a bit depressing. In scenes I would go from wow oh dang to what is even going on right now this is a little psychotic. Also it make me think of some current things going on between west papa New Guinean s and East Indonesians which adds some dislike to the movie. 
Good movie. A bit much. Maybe stick with raid 1. I would wait for your kids to at least be in their late teens or early twenties or unless they are real mature."

Massive props to Gareth Evans, I tip my SnapBack off to you sir! So in this sequel we follow our sole survivor, Rama, who must go undercover in order to protect his family from his new hardcore reputation that is making him popular in the criminal underworld. I'll start with the negatives, the first half was an absolute drag. This did not need to be 150 minutes long, at all. Could've easily established the power hungry Uco, who has major daddy issues, in a solid 20 minutes as opposed to an hour. So the long runtime and slow paced first half are my only complaints. This, as an action film, is absolutely insane. The Indonesian Terminator from the predecessor has now been substituted by a hammer wielding deaf girl, a well aimed baseball bat wielding guy (who can kill by hitting baseballs with insane precision...) and the ultimate blade wielding badass since Blade himself. That kitchen fight sequence was savage. The choreography was perfection, I've never shouted ""YEAH! STAB HIM!!"" so much. Evidently, watching this is releasing my inner murderous personality. The action set pieces were creative, from decimating prisoners in mud to a frantic car chase in downtown Jakarta...majestic. Some technical excellence from Evans, who performed such a great tracking shot that consists of going through 3 different cars in a chase scene. The use of blood and gore is ridiculously insane, great makeup effects. Even the no nonsense dialogue was insanely savage. Did I mention this film was both savage and insane?

Bigger budget, bigger ensemble, multiple locations, a car chase scene and clocking in at 150 minutes long, Berandal had the promised of be the sequel that we don't need but certainly the sequel that we deserve but it just fell short of living up to its lofty potential. Firstly the flaws; there were scenes and characters in the film that simply didn't belong and wholly unnecessary. The first is Yayan Ruhian as Prakoso; I don't fault Gareth Evans for wanting to include Yayan Ruhian again; hell, I would to but Yayan Ruhian is wasted as Prakoso, a character that could be played by anyone and certainly didn't need 3 scenes with 2 lackadaisical fight scenes. In one of the scenes, Perkoso ended up outside a club, during winter time, in tropical Jakarta; this is just pretentious nonsense; no one is South East Asia would ever believe that there is snow in the equator. Then there is also Batter and Hammer Girl; who are entirely necessary to the plot and their fight scenes were also lackluster. Julie Estelle as Hammer Girl especially, is really really weak; there was no acting, she can't fight, her choreography is crap. I think Gareth Evans was pressured into adding too much, and so, the film feels like it has a lot of 'bloatware.' All in all, you could at least cut off 30 minutes from the movie, which would've been a better outcome. More doesn't always mean more; less can be more. So, now the good. The movie has an excellent ensemble cast, even Yayan Ruhian shines as his role as Prakoso. Standout performances by Iko Uwais reprising his role as Rama, Ariffin Putra is fantastic as Uco (and he speaks excellent English), Tio Pakusadewo is credible as the mafia boss Bangun (and he speaks great Japanese), Ryuhei Matsuda and Keinichi Endo as the Goto family yakuza. The story had the potential to be really great a la Infernal Affairs or The Departed but due to the aforementioned 'bloatware' the story was reduced to gang rivalry, and a one man commando against the Indonesian Preman. I applaud Gareth Evans for depicting real criminal behavior along and this adds authenticity and believability to the film. Had, Evans cut out all the pretentious scenes out, he would have something really close to greatness. The best fight scene must be between Iko Uwais and Cecep Arif Rahman in the Kitchen fight with Karambit knives. This fight scene is as close to a real Silat fight as you can get and it was very well done. As it is, it's not bad. Berandal is not as good as Serbuan Maut, but it's still an entertaining affair."
" Infernal affairs
",0.0,-0.8979,2017-12-08 00:00:00,5,"The Raid was a lean mean action film which put Indonesian based, Welsh director Gareth Evans on the map alongside its star Iko Uwais. Several cast members went on to make cameo appearances in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.In Raid 2, Honest cop Rama (Iko Uwais) reluctantly accepts an assignment by an anti corruption unit to expose a corrupt chief of police Reza who is in league with city mobsters Bangun (Tio Pakusodewo) and Goto (Kenichi Endo.)Rama has to go deep undercover as Yuda, by being imprisoned and get close to Bangun's son Uco (Arifin Putra) which he does by saving his life in prison when a mob attacks.Two years later Yuda after being released from prison he is hired by Bangun to work in their organisation. Yuda discovers that Uco is unhappy with his father's conciliatory behaviour towards his rivals which he sees as a weakness. Goaded by a rival gang lord who is pushing Uco's buttons, Uco plans to take control of his father's gang. Yuda finds himself in great danger.The film's plot is inspired by movies such as The Departed and The Godfather. In contrast to the first film, the sequel concentrates on a story more than the action. I found it flabby and rather dull outside of the action scenes which were still frenetic and frenzied."
" Double bill - The Raid and The Raid 2
",0.0,-0.9763,2017-09-28 00:00:00,8,"Double bill time, Welsh filmmaker Gareth Evans has made a big splash with his action one-two punch which puts the Indonesian martial art ""Pencak Silat"" on a bigger map. Swimming against the tide of an inexorably digitized world, since the noughties, action movies have been experiencing a somewhat fundamentalistic revolution ushered in by ONG-BAK: THE THAI WARRIOR (2003), where a more tactile, point-blank and lethal combat style greatly relying on the performers' physical prowess sounding the death knell for a plethora of CGI-heavy schlock, and Gareth Evans takes the revolution further down that road, at any time of the day, it is more than welcomingBlanketed in its slate blue hue, THE RAID: REDEMPTION has a setting like a single-location entrapment horror flick, a catastrophic heavy blow incurs to a team of elite squad when they raid inside a tenement tower block owned by the crime lord Tama Riyado (Sahetapy) in Jakarta's slums, it turns out to be a set-up as a corollary of corruption among police top-brass. Assailed by not zombies but practically zombie-looking inhabitants (bedraggled drug addicts mostly) and a cohort of Tama's henchmen, they might find some painful irony (if they are still breathing) from recollecting the paradoxical pep talk of Sergeant Jaka (Taslim), who is leading the raid, paraphrasing here: it is a highly dangerous mission, but I don't want to see any of those seats empty when we return. The one who is bestowed with a protagonist nimbus is Rama (Uwais), a tyro in the forces and has an ax to grind in the game, when all the ammo is expended, his killer martial art skill starts to tip the scale in the bloodshed. Since its no-account story-line seldom fluctuates with plot development (barring a fraternal reunion), and although many tropes of suspense routinely deployed to the hilt, it is the action pieces taking our breath away, the go-for-the-jugular (joints, limbs, and other more cardinal parts) pragmatism and Evans' lenience on blood and guts, skewered together one set piece after another, our rapt attention becomes a given, and the brutal aesthetics reaches its crescendo in the close-range combat between Rama, his brother Andi (Alamsyah) and Tama's top muscle, a disheveled Mad Dog (Ruhian, who is a martial art virtuoso and the fight choreographer for both movies, also plays a completely different character in the sequel). After REDEMPTION successfully testing the water, THE RAID 2: BERANDAL (which means thug in Indonesian) is expectedly souped up by a significantly boosted budget and an ampler length (150 minutes, 50 minutes longer than the first installment). Mapping out an ambitious gangster turf war saga, Evans' script swiftly sends Rama to the joint to befriend Uco (Putra), the son of Bangun (Pakusadewo), one of the two kingpins of Jakarta's underworld, where a muddy mêlèe during a downpour set alight the first frisson of excitement (it is a virtue Evans doesn't overuse the worn- out slo-mo shtick, after THE MATRIX 1999 and its countless emulators, enough is enough). In fact, the resultant story veers more towards Uco's ill-conceived subversion, and Putra, not quite a martial artist himself but commendably takes up the gauntlet as a pompous gilded youth, too thrusting and wanting both wits and patience to mellow into a rightful heir of his father's cosmic empire, particularly when there is nothing to imperil his standing, what is the fuss anyway? Maybe like in every patriarch's incubus, he is just a bad seed and driven at lengths to carry out a patricidal sin, Putra's performance is vehement, visceral and transforms Uco as the film's heart of matter, a grab bag of what is wrong with today's youngsters. In the action section, on the one hand, Evans continues choreographing striking fighting sequences of Pencak Silat, and playing up the possibility of orchestration within a two-by-four space (a prison bathroom, or inside a barreling car); on the other hand, in tandem with an enclosed fistfight, he also cuts his teeth into a sterling car chase set piece with an ace in his sleeve, and what an adrenaline rush it spurs! Although it would be remiss of me to not mention a congenital hiccup rather common in action fares, those conspicuous ready-to-take-the-hit poses or caesuras, mostly from foot soldiers during their fleeting screen-time, it immediately dispels the ""realness"" of all the onerously rehearsed teamwork. The most pyrotechnic eye-catcher is indubitably the final showdown between Rama and the karambit-knives-wielding killer, credited as the Assassin (Rahman), which makes Very Tri Yulisman's Baseball Bat Man and Julie Estelle's Hammer Girl quite bathetic in their gore-fest, not to mention the boss who prefers heavy weaponry but is inept enough to toss it to the wrong one when the crunch comes.Both movies are cracking genre pieces made with labor of love, devotion and dexterity, and Evans' directorial flair takes a crucial peg up under the sequel's grander scale, blissfully, one can see the potential in a filmmaker which can unbridle the genre parameters."
" The Single Greatest Action Scenes That I Have Ever Seen
",0.6369,0.9902,2017-09-05 00:00:00,9,"The Raid 2 is an absolute masterclass of action cinema. It picks up immediately after the events of the first film and our main character, Rama, is almost instantly thrown right back into the world of crime that he only got a taste of in The Raid.This film excels in almost every way but lets first talk about it's main selling point: the action. The Raid 2 contains, as the title suggests, the absolute greatest action sequences that I have ever seen. Everything is brutally realistic to a point where you start to feel bad for the characters involved, but at the same time you never want the fights to stop. The martial arts choreography is something to behold, and the direction is absolutely stunning. There are very few cuts and every time there is one it is absolutely necessary and enhances the scene rather than detracting from it. The main actor, Iko Uwais, clearly did all his own stunts, which is something that you rarely see and is to be applauded.Speaking of direction and cinematography, even outside of the action this film is absolutely gorgeous. The director, Gareth Evans, has a way of making certain settings feel very real. Clean when appropriate, grimy when appropriate.The acting is great all around. Iko Uwais plays extremely well as Rama and he has a lot more to do in this movie than he did in the last. Arifin Putra does a great job as Uco, the unhinged son of a mob boss, and returning as a different character, Yayan Ruhian is incredible as Prakoso despite his minimal screen time.If I have to choose a flaw with this movie it would be that it is a bit overlong at 150 minutes, whereas the first was a comfortable 101 minutes. Despite this one minor issue I cannot stress enough that this is a must-see for any action junkie. The Raid 2 is truly amazing.The End"
" OUTSTANDING action cinema - Hollywood take note!

If you like action watch this film!The action scenes are so beautifully choreographed it ranks as a FULL 10. No ifs or buts, this is currently THE action standard by which other films need to be judged. The action starts as top-notch and keeps improving as the film progresses.It also has a decent plot although possibly overlong in this respect. We don't expect a classic musical to have the world's best plot, so why an action movie? So many critics fail on this point!The director, Gareth Evans, is going to be seriously big in the industry as are his cohorts Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian who contributed the unbelievably good action sequences.The fact that this was produced for an estimated under $5m is shameful on Hollywood.Watch it, be amazed, get a huge fix of adrenaline, and wonder why Hollywood can't get close to the raw intensity generated by these action scenes."
" Suspend reality and allow for comic book fight sequences.
",-0.4588,-0.8454,2017-07-17 00:00:00,7,"Well , yes is a good film not a great film, yes it's non-stop and entertaining but I can't state it's the best ever or brilliant fight scenes. There is better out there. When fights are on a one to one basis this movie improves (especially the kitchen fight action near the end of the film). It's the group fights that let it down badly, okay so there loads of people they need to defeat or get past. It seems like the bad guys are all waiting in line for there turn to fight! Numerous times we see them running towards the hero in the background, 3,4,5 at a time only to have one attack and then another with the rest still running in from the background. It just takes the edge off the whole thing. Especially when some (*Sorry spoiler alert*) get hit by empty water cooler bottles which results in them being thrown to the fall in total agony unable to get up and fight anymore!? I'd prefer to have these stupid aspects taken out of the film, as it totally takes away from the rest of the action that unfolds. That and the rubber toilet at the start of the film just takes the shine off a clever and at times well made film."

" With the element of surprise gone, the sequel struggles to compete as a regular action movie
",-0.1027,-0.9573,2017-03-12 00:00:00,6,"The popular Indonesian frantic gruesome martial arts saga is back with a bang with Rama again in the middle promising more of what made the original so effective. With no expectations whatsoever, The Raid Redemption became a sleeper hit both with the audience as well as the critics with none having a clue of what hit them. The dynamics have changed now and people tend to expect and compare from which very few attempts hit the mark. This story starts from where its predecessor has left off with Rama (Iko Uwais) is getting debriefed at an unconventional location. A police chief coerces Rama into going undercover to both unearth another corrupt cop and also to take heat off from him and protect his family. Rama infiltrates the syndicate run by Bangun (Tio Pakusadewo) a wise patriarch through his hot blooded son Uco (Arifin Putra). He has to struggle to keep his identity a secret, discover the secrets, collect evidence and miss his wife and newly born son. When Uco comes up with his own agenda, can Rama survive?Since this story is out in the open world and not constrained within an apartment building - it is both good and bad. The innovation to excel within its limitations is where the original made its mark but in the open world - it is just as any other movie. The director tries to squeeze everything into it like the prison riots, car chases, modern gadgets along with its famous punches and kicks. He even brought back his Mad Dog Yahan Ruhian in different role with a completely different look. Everything looks like they should from a technical stand point but many things doesn't add up from dramatic and emotional point of view.The original had the relentless pace, even before the previous action set piece is concluded a new one is already midway. The same cannot be said here as it invests in a bigger story, more characters and their development which doesn't seem to be the director's strengths - leading to a bloated runtime. Its plot drivers are riddled with holes like what happens to the injured guy who will be taken away for treatment in the beginning, Rama is seen extremely struggling with an injury and a moment later he is fighting off dozens of bad guys without a sign of the injury and many such continuity issues. Bringing the story to the open world also introduces us to a long list of characters like the 'Hammer Girl' who is similar to Gogo from Kill Bill, the baseball bat guy, Uco and his father, his Japanese friend/rival and his son etc. where most characters get uninteresting in a short-while.With the element of surprise gone, the sequel struggles to compete as a regular action movie."
" Almost perfect
",0.5279,0.9984,2017-03-10 00:00:00,9,"First of all, I do not understand the complaints some people have with this movie. No guns? Indonesia isn't a country where it's easy to obtain guns. Do you watch war movies and complain ""no a-bombs""? Too long? Why can't a movie be 150 minutes or even 230 or 500 minutes if it's good? Because too much over-stimulation has lowered our attention span? Then here's a good way to train it again(or the great ""Love Exposure"").Some complained that the story didn't make sense, that the first part had better fight scenes, etc...Naturally, the first part had to rely more on fight scenes, since they didn't have the budget for many locations or a bigger story. Here, we still get to see a lot of(creative) fight scenes, but we also get to see a car chase, some shootings, betrayal...For me, the only ""complaints"" are the snow scene(as beautiful as it is, it might as well snow in hell, it's Jakarta!) and...I think that's about it. And it's beautiful to watch, so it's not really a problem for me. Another small issue for me are the subtitles...my Indonesian is far from fluent, but I noticed that most of the time, the translation is far from what they're actually saying. Sometimes, it's just minor differences, but some differences are pretty big. For example, Uco refers to his father as ""Sir""/""pa""(short for ""bapak""). Now, ""pak"" or ""pa"" is indeed how you usually refer to older males in Indonesia(cab drivers, street vendors). But why would a son refer to his father as sir? But again, these are small things and especially the subtitles are not the directors fault, nor the actors.On the plus side, we have a real story this time. And it isn't just some cookie-cutter story line, but it's a pretty good one too! It has twists, it is exciting, it has interesting characters(and develops them). We get to see how Uco can't handle to stand in his father's shadow and how it eats him up inside...we can see how, despite being on the other side of the law(which he upheld so much in part 1), Rama realizes that the world isn't just black and white, good or bad...and that even among the ""bad"" guys, there are some who are really bad and some who may have strayed(Eka). Also, as someone who loves Indonesia and who's been to Jakarta countless times, I really love to see a movie in which we actually get to see this great city. It's a really nice change of venue and I wish a lot more movies would be shot in cities like this...it can be romantic(Thamrin at night, the underpass at Jl. Blora), it can be spooky and creepy(North Jakarta, parts of Grogol, East Jkt), it can be commercial(this city has probably 150 malls or more). Sure, it is unrealistically empty(anyone who's been to Jakarta will know that any street is basically NEVER empty, no matter how late at night or early in the day) and the car chase seems to be done, circling around the CBD only(which makes sense though, as Jakarta suffers from huge traffic issues and it would be a lot easier to stop traffic there than in any of the major roads). But at least it gives people an idea what this city looks like and might allow for more people to visit it.I hope that we'll get to see more good movies from Indonesia in the future, even with Gareth Evans having left the country. Before him, most of the movies they made were shallow soap opera-like romantic comedies or dramas, all of which not very appealing to non- Indonesians(and even many Indonesians, according to my friends). It's an underestimated country and I'd be happy to see it receive more international fame."

" Bigger yet smaller than the original
",0.3182,0.9336,2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"The Raid 2 is a long movie, but not a very interesting one. Starting up shortly after the last one ended, the hero goes undercover with the mob in search of police corruption, but the movie ignores that in favor of a perpetually uninteresting and occasionally confusing story centered on the son of the head mobster.It's interesting reading the reviews here because they are mainly favorable and focus on how much action there was even though I felt like the action was pretty thin for most of the movie. There are some big solid fights here and there, such as a muddy one in a prison yard, but there are also long stretches of action-less, tedious storytelling. I felt like I spent a tremendous amount of time waiting for anything interesting to happen, and it wasn't until very near the end that the pace picked up, notably with a big car battle and an exciting fight involving curved blades. User reviews describe this film as more action-packed than the original, but while there may be more action in total, I suspect there's less per minute; it doesn't feel packed by any means.I watched this movie because I really enjoyed the original, but before I compare the two I have to add the caveat that I don't remember the first one that well and am going from a general impression (I seem to have forgot to review it after I saw it).The first movie had a brilliant premise in that the whole movie was a cops vs. criminals battle in a single apartment building. Movies that close the participants in, like Die Hard or Alien, offer filmmakers a sort of built-in discipline, and The Raid was tightly focused because of its structure. The sequel, on the other hand, can go anywhere and does, resulting in something rambling and fuzzy.While I don't remember the details, I do remember it was one of those movies where I would say ""WOAH!"" out loud from time to time as something amazing happened. I did not say ""woah"" once during The Raid 2, although I did say ""ick"" a number of times. The violence is gory and sadistic, so even when it's clever and well-choreographed, as in some subway carnage involving hammers, I found it a bit much.With characters I didn't care about, a clichéd story that didn't make much sense, and action sequences spaced too far apart, this movie never pulled me in. I don't think I'll even bother with the inevitable Raid 3."
" The Raid Expanded
",0.0,0.7303,2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"While reportedly conceptualised before the first 'Raid' movie, this high octane sequel actually feels like a reaction to what some critics did not like about Part One. There is more character development this time round, a more complex story (involving working undercover to take down corrupt police officers) and more dramatic scenes in between all the fights. Gareth Evans does as excellent a job as ever filming all the action, with lengthy unbroken shots as the camera follows characters who are thrown through glass windows and scurry around dilapidated buildings. The film's deflections from the first 'Raid' movie are a mixed blessing though. The antagonists are delightfully less clear cut and the film really lets one get under the skin of its protagonist, played by Iko Uwais. The claustrophobic nature of Part One is sorely missed though and the less frenetic pacing reduces any sense of urgency. Whereas the first film throws a bunch of police officers in a situation where they are unable to escape or retreat and have to fight to survive, there is less sense of a life and death struggle here. 'The Raid 2' does feature some great characters though. At first, it is confusing to have Yayan Ruhian ('Mad Dog' in the first film) pop up as a different character, but it is such a wildly different character that it reflects his acting range. Julie Estelle also makes for an excellent foe, though her screen time is sadly limited. While not the all-time greatest action film that some have hailed it as, 'The Raid 2' is certainly enthralling when at its best and undeniably memorable."
