" What was in the bag ? !!

" Dark movie.

" Reading the reviews of this movie was more entertaining than watching the movie itself
",0.4927,0.9804,2020-11-28 00:00:00,2,"Reading the reviews of this movie was more entertaining than watching the movie itself. I too am left wondering how both Cusack and De Niro could have been roped into this. The sign on script had to have been better than the end product. The dialogue was painful to watch acted out. I kept waiting and hoping, waiting and hoping... and only an hour had gone by... and it continued... and did not get the slightest bit better. At one point I paused it and saw I still had 35 mins to go and I was like ""but it feels like it's been 2hrs already!?"". Wow. Not the go to when a gal wants to enjoy some Cusack. I must admit though, I did get a few good belly laughs due to the sheer ridiculousness of the dialogue and/or writing. Feel bad voicing all this, but... save yourselves!"

",-0.2263,0.9969,2019-12-27 00:00:00,6,"*** WARNING THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! ***Ever since Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" became a major commercial hit, we have seen countless of slightly similarly-influenced ""genre"" films based on situations and dialogues pop up both in theaters, but also in home video, and now streaming platforms.This has allowed lesser-known writers and directors the chance to get their ""film d'auteur"" produced and released. Sometimes it works well, other times it just falls flat, like a big pile of forgetful ""whatever"".""The Bag Man"" is obviously not for everyone, even though with main stars John Cusack and Robert DeNiro, it almost seems like a garanteed success, like a film which should be quite obviously more ""publicly appreciated"" due to star appeal. I mean how many times have star vehicles been over-hyped when in fact, if said stars were replaced by, say, indie or D-listers, the film in question wouldn't be on anyone's radar.But enough about that. The premise of the film is that presumed ""gangster criminal"" DeNiro hires Cusack to fetch and bring him a duffel bag, specifically instructed never to look in said bag. The bulk of the film is the overnight stay of Cusack's character in a shady motel awaiting the arrival of DeNiro to get paid. The ending feels a bit anti-climactic but resolves the main issues of the story while also dotting the ""i"" 's and crossing the ""T"" 's.What works best for this film is the strange and unusual rhythm and pacing. Quite unlike most of what we have grown accustomed to by Hollowood standards, the film's tone is a mix between tension, action, subdued isolationism, and a bit of semi-subliminal surrealism.Also of note are the performances. Granted you can get DeNiro to talk at a blank chalkboard and you would still pay attention, and Cusack's own presence is something which inspires a certain trust, or at least a sense of reliability (could this be what really happened to the character Martin Blank after the events of the film ""Grosse Point Blank""?).Rebecca Da Costa is also quite noteworthy, especially considering what she has to work with, her wardrobe (which strangely keeps changing throughout the movie and yet there is never any mention of extra clothes of hers whatsoever) constrictions, and the highly sexualized nature of what her character inspires from, and to, others. In fact she holds her own quite well that by the 1/2 or 2/3 mark, I found myself more invested in her character than anyone else's.Crispin Glover is of course a talented actor as is, and when they hire him to portray odd and unconventional characters always adds depth to said characters. There are times you forget the actor and focus on the character portrayed on the screen, and while Mr Glover is impossible to mix up with anyone else, his presence and delivery is simply unique. It's interesting that when you Watch him play this charcater, ""Ned"", you can't help but keep wondering what,s his darn back story?Often overlooked Dominic Purcell is also quite a surprise as he delivers what I consider one of his better performances, again given the role he has to play and working with what he's got. All too often he becomes a blur behind main stars (or ""A"" listers, if you will) or just keeps a film Rolling along when he is given the lead (no offense whatsoever to his acting talents, by the why), but as sheriff ""Larson"", he truly gives a great screen presence.Also Worth mentioning is Martin Klebba who is truly gives off a menacing vibe in this film. From the moment he appears, one simply has a distrusting feel/vibe about him.What also works for the film is the fact that you, the viewer, don't really know where the plot is going... for the most part. As the story slowly unfolds with a series of ""events"" and ""sequences"", with the players slowly revealing (or dying only to be later revealed that...) their motivations, the viewer is being eclipsed to the clues scattered throughout about the outcome.... However this also prooved to be part of it's own outdoing in the process. One could almost see the final act coming a mile away even though the film is designed to keep our eyes and ears away from the usual clues and such. And yes, one could also claim that the characters are rather stereotypical in their portrayal on screen. But let us not forget that these characters barely have 90 minutes to be fleshed out, and that their main goal is essentially to allow the story to unfold.Anyway, all of my rambling here just to say that's it's a decent effort, not necessarly for everyone and maybe not a film worthy of multiple viewings, but in the end, it is the subjectivity of the viewer who decides the value of the film."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.0249,2019-11-14 00:00:00,1,Begins auspicious and interesting but unfolds with every minute and degenerates into an extremely boring movie without plot or tension.
" According to most Shawshank Redemption was a bust as well.
",0.2732,0.9945,2019-08-31 00:00:00,10,"This film is absolutely remarkable, from the incredible acting of every single one of the featured cast members to the gorgeous cinematography, to the beautiful sound design, to lovingly crafted nearly fully practical effects and properties. Just singularly amazing. Certainly a role unlike any I've Ever seen James Franco play, but one which he nonetheless somehow pulled off with his marvelously indelible style. Zoe Kravitz in a role which could have easily become a cringeworthy sex worker trope and instead became a realistic, compelling, three dimensional gem, loveably hardcore in completely grounded and sincere way. Which goes without saying for elder and younger brothers alike as well. I have no idea what exception people took with this film, other than to say that maybe, just maybe, all genre films aren't created for the benefit, perspective or portrayal of the majority demographic, and that maybe the representation that brings can be a simultaneously kickass and beautiful thing.Hats off to everyone who worked on this production. You've made something genuinely remarkable here and I'm so glad to have finally gotten the chance to see it. Keep going, ignore the detractors. Believe in what you're doing because you've all got something outstanding to offer, and time will amplify in the future what the present noise is drowning out. Bravo friends."
" ""Distrust is a disease that kills a friendship.""
",-0.743,0.9767,2019-05-28 00:00:00,7,"This wasn't John Cusack's first film excursion as an assassin. He was in 1997's ""Gross Pointe Blank"", but that was done in a decidedly more humorous vein. Here he's somewhat at a disadvantage while expediting a mission for his boss Dragna, a weirdly coiffed Robert De Niro, who's inspiration might have come from having seen Joe Pesci in ""8 Heads in a Duffel Bag"". Only this time, the contents of the bag is a mystery, and it'll probably make your stomach turn when the big reveal is finally made. If I were Jack (Cusack), I'd be pretty upset too, enough to take a shovel to the head of a motel desk clerk with a Mother Bates complex like good old Ned (Crispin Glover). Ned played his role like Flash the Sloth in ""Zootopia"", but since that film came out a couple of years after this one, you might say Flash took his cues from Ned. Anyway, as the viewer, you're pretty much kept in the dark with what's going on till near the finale when Dragna confirms that Jack never looked in the bag, which only proves that now, Jack will have to look in the bag because Dragna is such a heel. Too bad for Dragna, because he could have set up a lot more paydays for his favorite assassin and bag man, if only he had a little trust."
" Way better than the reviews on here...
",0.4404,0.9489,2019-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Well first of all this was not chase em high action keep you on the edge of your seat type of movie. But I thought it was a solid well-acted movie, and quite frankly the cast is what kept me it it. I thought the plot was good and it wasn't that type of movie where they keep you in suspense thinking what's in the bag and then you don't find out, at the end with this movie you have absolutely find out what's in it and turns out to be one of the best scenes in the movie. The movie kept me entertained and wondering at all points on what was going to happen which to me is what I look for in a movie."
" A Rather Intriguing Crime Thriller
",-0.4767,0.976,2019-01-15 00:00:00,8,"24 January 2015. This crime thriller is rather intriguing because of its atypical violent nature and the mysterious black bag. There are an assortment of odd characters in this movie as well as the dialectical dance between the main characters. The atmosphere of this movie is creepy and ominous and a bit crazy. It's sort of tame version of Blue Velvet (1986). Yet balanced against this movie's craziness, is the more straightforward almost Alien (1979) like John Cusack's espionage thriller The Numbers Station (2013) which offers a more subtle but linear thriller which allows the viewer to really experience the totality of suspense instead of getting mentally twisted.As for John Cusack, he is one of the few amazing two-dimensional character actors whose on-screen persona has been perfected to portray multiple genre movies from comedy, drama, romance, action, to horror. What Cusack has done is create a quality character with such depth that he can transform his on-screen character to fit most any range of genres needed. It's like he's developed a complete, comprehensive character who gets to experience the universe of movie categories. So depending on one's preference, The Bag Man might be too strange, too scripted or it might be a fascinating interplay of strangeness that results in a totally exciting American version of puzzling violence with an odd sense of twisted morality.The presentation in another mystery thriller gets even better in Residue (2017)."
" Great movie....

",0.6504,0.2846,2018-11-09 00:00:00,6,"People had a hard time following Raymond Chandler novels. Decades ago. But, the action and suspense were compelling . This is the second time I've watched this and I was gripped throughout. I think the poor reviews are overkill.
If it was that bad, how did they get such good actors to support it? Maybe they could see something of value in it.You are dealing with pathological personalities throughout. That could make it hard for some people to appreciate.I'll plug in one thing that could make it more comprehensible and understandable....the girl (supposedly working for DeNiro...is Mossad)Chew on that."
" YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO
",0.0,-0.8325,2018-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Jack (John Cusack) is instructed by Dragna (Robert De Niro) to pick up a bag and take it to a specific motel and to check into room 13. He is instructed not to look into the bag. Things go bad. We reach a point where he is in the room. He has a dead man in the trunk of his car which doesn't lock. His hand is bleeding where his cell phone was shot out from it. There are two undercover agents next door. He gets entangled with a six foot tall prostitute (Rebecca Da Costa) her one eyed pimp (Sticky Fingaz) and a Serbian midget (Martin Klebba). Cops seem to be everywhere and the motel is run by the creepy Crispin Glover who learned everything he knows about motel management from Norman Bates.His boss calls him and tells him to read Hermann Hesse ""Magister Ludi"" which loosely relates to the mystery of the circus characters. Then things get weird.This is a noir style mystery. There are two mysteries here. One is ""What is with all the odd ball characters?"" and the second one is ""What is in the bag?"" I will say I had them both figured out before they were revealed as it fit an oddball formula. However, I grew annoyed with the film, able to feel the frustration of Jack, but not in a good way.The film has few characters. It has dark humorous elements added to this crime drama thriller. Indeed, the plot alone is darkly comical. The film has a lot of things going for it, and as a fan of the genre, it was able to grab me, but then kept letting me go.
. Good rental for those who like a quirky noir mystery.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex talk. No sex or nudity."

",0.431,0.8316,2018-08-17 00:00:00,9,"I was curious what was in the bag. I will turn off a movie after 10 minutes if I'm bored, but not this movie. Had good actors who did a good job. I would watch it again."
" More than it seems: a commentary on original sin hiding in the gritty world of hitmen
",-0.5423,-0.9932,2018-06-04 00:00:00,10,"I'd challenge the other reviews here to a battle of wits, but they seem to be unarmed. :3
(The best lines in this movie sneak in there casually...)All the comments here (both positive and negative) that discuss only the literal dialogue/plot interactions seem to be overlooking that besides being a gritty noir populated with strange individuals, the characters are acting out a moral commentary on original sin.Whether you were able to predict what would be in the bag is not nearly as important as the question represented by the bag itself: Should you open it? Bite the apple? Gain knowledge and take responsibility for the consequences?There is a line about the value of allegiance being more than what John's character is getting for it, and the content of the bag (and the degrading aspect of his blind loyalty) is literally the cost of his greed. In no uncertain terms.Da Costa's character's love for Israel is not a quirky random comment - it's your clue-in to her representation of Eve (which follows shortly after the more pointed comment about ""making Adam watch""...). Jack and Rivka are the only two characters here who show any humanity - empathy - so surely they are the parallels for humanity, Adam and Eve, in this dangerous and imperfect world.Meanwhile, what does De Niro represent? ""What are you doing in public without your horns?"" Da Costa remarks at a later point. This implies the devil, and yet his role in creating the whole environment the story takes place in (and establishing the bag scenario) is more like to that of god, creating the garden and yet including this invitation to ""disaster"" that is temptation in the form of the tree - the bag. Is opening the bag/biting the apple a sin, or is it means of empowerment?Wouldn't to obey perfectly and choose ignorance be to disappoint the potential of the human model? This is where De Niro's condescending comments about Pavlovian loyalty come in.What one ""ought"" to do depends on what is wanted by ""god"" from humanity: if ""god"" wanted a predictable/trustworthy tool then curiosity is a negative (biting the apple/opening the bag is a sin); if ""god"" wanted entities competent in handling free will, then the point of the test was, in fact, to break the rules for the sake of overcoming ignorance and avoiding purveying evil negligently. Delivering the bag without opening it causes a kind of ""blank check"" moral accountability - because you contributed while consciously choosing not to be aware of the content you were propagating. De Niro's ""caveat emptor""... not checking the moral goods you're becoming responsible for is on you. You're still responsible, because the ignorance was intentional. To act with intentional ignorance is negligence.Then, there at the end, she is genuinely sorry for her curiosity, knowing it will cost them, and yet Jack's commitment at that particular moment is a confirmation that we *should* be curious. To bite the apple is to learn, to learn is to take responsibility, and to take responsibility is to reach for your humanity.John's character remarks, ""you know we're going to die."" What else would be the consequence of going against god? And yet I would argue that De Niro was meant to represent a false god (whether the perspective should be that all gods are false - rationalization for avoiding wrestling with responsibility for morality - I won't conclude) but there is a definite ""man behind the curtain"" feeling that emerges. Without spoiling any specifics, when things get more heated, De Niro's character threatens to destroy the whole world in which the story has turned - the motel. Is this the perceived threat of killing our religious allegiances (or any established power)? The threat of an uncertain outcome that intimidates us away from claiming responsibility. To challenge god and be wrong can cost us more than our own lives - it can implicate the lives of others. But our greed has already cost as much, and with less purpose.The implications can be extended to the viewer him/herself:
Choosing to just demand our pay (as Jack does repeatedly) to continue living in our own bubble, for ease/convenience/laziness, can be a form of greed as costly as any other. To think we can live in comfort without moral culpability just by ""minding our own business"" while others suffer is greed. Almost a greed for peace - we are not willing to disturb the peace of our conventional routines to acknowledge the suffering of others. Which, we have a moral responsibility to do - to learn what is being done in our name by national proxy and deal with the responsibility, though it might cost our convenience and our hollow pride - it might be the death of our plastic bubble lives. Takes courage to open the bag."
" Dig This Film...Have Watched it Several Times
",0.0,0.9992,2018-05-12 00:00:00,7,"Recorded on the DVR, I've probably watched it six times already. The Bag Man quite obviously isn't for everybody. Maybe expectations. Maybe there's just something missing with some who ""didn't get it"", or don't have that *something* inside them that finds the allure.Analysis is tough on this one. It's not a sophisticated storyline. The script only has moments of clever dialogue. Mostly, it's the overall mood, I suppose. It's in directing, the soundtrack, cinematography, etc. that gives it its appeal for me. I gave it a ""7"" rating, because I don't abuse and overreact. An 8 has to be exceptional. A 9...genuinely phenomenal. I've never yet given a film a 10. Conversely, a 6 still has some merit. A 5 is so-so, but some definite cringe-worthy moments. And so forth. Point being, I saw quite a few 1s in the reviews (and 2s and 3s). A 1 is virtual static on the screen in my mind, or something that looks like a 2nd Grade movie project that somehow made it to the big screen. IMDb raters...sigh. Well, a rating is in the eye of the rater. For those of us who ""get it"", I bet we'd agree that those who didn't just don't have the receptors to pick up on the Director's vision.Cusack's as an actor was my initial attraction. His roles in Identity and others drew me in. His performance in TBM was as intriguing as any of his other best films. Sorry, but Cell was a bummer. His acting was lackluster and the film was just weird (the ending was just funky, as hard as I tried to play along). But in TBM, he was at the top of his game. I didn't ""see"" acting. I saw what I love about him most; a natural born actor who takes me into the life of the character. Can't ask for more.De Niro: Another reviewer is correct to an extent - that he can play a gangster in his sleep. Agreed, but ol' Bob is also in major cruise mode in his career, being his Golden Years. I've seen the passion receding over the last 15 years. Even in more significant roles like Silver Linings Playbook, I've detected less than 100% from him like in his most impacting historical roles. That wasn't the objective here, to play a character like Leonard in Awakenings, or Rupert Pupkin in the King of Comedy. However, there was only a fleeting moment or two at best when I felt he wasn't fully immersed in the smaller role of Dragna. I got the impression he really liked this role. Interestingly, he looked physically better than I've seen him in years. He was tan, had super cool hair, slick and hip glasses, and he slipped right in to the image of that character. I wouldn't be surprised if that's why he accepted the part. I'm not convinced it was the script that captivated him. Even his opening lines are relatively straightforward. Yes, some of his later banter was medium-witty, but nothing that will leave one changed forever. Regardless, he was cooler looking than I've seen him in years. But don't get me wrong. I'm not interested in seeing De Niro look cool. His character's cool worked perfectly with the mood of the film.Crispin Glover was captivating. So smooth and believable as Ned, the motel clerk. If one thinks of the non-event checking into a hotel can be, Ned makes it the polar opposite of that. In short, the character of Ned is loaded with character. And while other reviewers speak for you and me, ""...you can't help but think..."", I'll speak for myself: I love Crispin in this role. I haven't seen him in a while, but I still remember his impact on me in his role in the movie Teachers. He was powerful then, and hasn't lost anything in his dedication to his roles.Rebecca Da Costa: A very intriguing choice in casting. An odd voice (accent), and at first, wondered if her acting was up to par. In the end, I believe her acting was fine. It was just her odd personality, which added to the unusual chapter of Jack's (Cusack) life. It augmented the realism of finding oneself amidst a troubled, yet fascinating person. Some people aren't attracted to those types. Maybe that makes the difference...the secret desire to live a chapter of Jack's life. That's what a film should do - take us inside it and live that life for a couple hours; have us wonder whether Rivka (Da Costa) was a cheap hooker, or someone we could fall in love with; a caring, smart and compassionate person. A foreigner who just so happens to be uniquely beautiful, awkwardly trying to seduce, yet too often showing her genuine self and sincerity as a human being.On the surface, if I didn't get ""immersed"", I'd probably give it a 5. But I got sucked in. I got it. A solid 7 for me. Bravo to those who made this film. I'll be watching it again."
" Not suited for the popcorn loving masses
",0.5994,0.9913,2018-03-27 00:00:00,7,"When Imdb ratings are split in extremes of highs and lows it is easy to conclude if the movie is to my liking. But when the imdb ratings are average (5 -6) then these rating points by themselves are useless.This is the case with The Bag Man who got average ratings. Then instead of merely looking at ratings, you gonna have to read the indepth reviews of those people who can look beyond the popular vote to decipher if the movie is any good. But come on, just the presence of Robert de Niro alone should have made people curious. The Bag Man is by all means a good suspense thriller, made with attention to detail. But it is not an ordinary popular thriller. It doesnt fit the mold of suspension thrillers that the masses yearn for. If you are a popcornkid wanting stereotyped entertainment pass this movie by, it is not made for you, because little to none funny violence and lots of scenes where nothing happens. The masses must be entertained every second with new twists otherwise their minds start to drift. And the masses came to see this movie because of the popular actors in it. But they didnt get what they paid for: mindless entertainment.The story is simple: John Cusack plays a criminal who is ordered by crime boss Robert de Niro to transport a bag to a motel. At no time at all is John Cusack allowed to look INSIDE the bag. He only has to deliver the bag to the motel and wait. How simple can it be?The acting is topnotch. John Cusack plays one of his best roles. De Niro's chararcter is weird, but in a dangerous way. All the supporting actors are excellent.The flow of the movie is good although slow, which I like, because there are lots of scenes in which characters get time to interact with eachother on a real life like level.The story is very suspensefull till the end. I really loved its intensity. I would certainly rate it with a minimum of 7 points. The only thing keeping me from higher ratings is the stories ending."
" What is in the bloody bag?!
",-0.4926,-0.2051,2018-02-03 00:00:00,5,"This ons is a weird one to review. Looking through other reviews, most people gave it negative reviews, calling it predictable or whatnot. First things firsts, I thought acting was fine. Nothing top notch, but fine. Cusack's role, Jack, is likeable and, even though he's some sort of hitman, you care for him.The plot is strange, to say the least, but I guess that's because everything is roughly explained. Some acts are odd and makes no sense. I mean, the beginning of the movie seems like the director lost part of the footage and had to come up with something. One act with De Niro and Hodge didn't fit the overall movie plot, to me at least.It was obvious that staying in motel room 13 wasn't going to be an easy task. What I thought was weird is that everybody is after that goddamn bag, even though none of them seems to know what's inside it.Of course every act is explained in the finale, and when that happens, it leaves a weird impression. De Niro's motives seems dumb and uninspired, but then again, if you come to think of it, it's pretty much the same with any mob boss impersonation in any movie.I thought it was an OK movie to watch. It kept me hanging, wandering what was in the bag, but I must say I wasn't overly attached to knowing what was inside of it, questioning every act and so on. I was only following the story and trying to make sense of it.It was a fine movie to waste some time in a quiet Saturday afternoon."
" It isn't that bad actually
",0.431,0.4952,2017-08-14 00:00:00,7,"OK so I read the horrible reviews this film received, so when it was playing on TV I wasn't that excited. And then I just started to watch it, and it turned out to be not so horrible after all.In the first few minutes it looked like some cheap Tarantino-ripoff, only without the good dialogue and style, and it was painful I have to admit. The interactions between the characters aren't as witty as funny as in a QT movie, while obviously the makers were aiming at capturing the same atmosphere, but it just comes off painfully unfunny and forced.But, after 20 minutes the movie starts to become slightly different, like somehow the makers just decided to 'OK we can't copy Tarantino so let's just make our own movie'. There are actually a few good jokes and even a really minor portion of style as well. In the second act the movie almost catches up, there are a few moments of actual tension, while also some good jokes. I also liked the kind of mystery surrounding the main character, as his motives and whole persona isn't quite clear in the first part of the movie. It is too bad that in the third act the movie turns from 'kind of funny-weird but OK' to 'completely ridiculous' in about a few minutes. Characters just start to make idiotic decisions (which wasn't usual before), motivations make no sense and even change from one extent to another, and all in all the whole stuff doesn't make sense anymore. Maybe the creators just realized that they were at the end of the movie, and something like 'hey this is the end of our Tarantino lookalike movie, so let's just make a you-didn't-expected- everyone-shoots-at-everyone ending because that makes Tarantino movies good, right?' went down, what completely ruined the movie in my opinion.There is also a huuuuuge plot hole as well, where one character's motives are just doesn't make ANY sense, although you will only realize that after the last 'reveal' scene of the movie. BTW, the whole mystery of the bag is a bit (OK, way too) forced, they tried to build up this huge anticipation and mystery about it, but you can easily guess by the end, what is in the bag after all.A bit waste of good talent as well, Cusack is always likable and he delivers his standards here too, DeNiro clearly does not take things too seriously (in fact, a bit over the top, especially at the end, which just further emphasizes the awfulness of the whole scene). I haven't heard about the female lead before, but I found her OK in this movie.All in all it's a 6.5/10 for me, it is a perfectly disposable, one- watch thriller that's actually not bad when it's not trying to be some other movie. It could be quite fun if you have the right mindset for it."
" Lame story
",-0.4215,0.9632,2017-03-18 00:00:00,5,"You would think that a movie with an interesting cast should made a better movie than The Bag Man. The story is long and going nowhere at some point. In the beginning it's all okay but at one point you start wondering what the heck they want to prove. John Cusak isn't bad but the story-line doesn't plead in his favor. Rebecca Da Costa just has one facial expression during the entire movie and after a while it's getting annoying. And it's clearly not Robert DeNiro's best role ever, let that be noted. The movie could have been better if it was not for the lame story. I wouldn't waste my time on this one if I were you. I wish I didn't but for me it's too late."
" A mystery bag in the hands of an obedient man!
",0.0,0.9723,2017-01-24 00:00:00,5,"As the title suggests, it's all about the bag, a mystery bag. An interesting angle of storytelling. It was a good mystery, though they did not get it right. The plot line had all the ingredients, but while developing it, they had lost the way. I was not impressed with the writing and also the direction. It is engaging with a fine pace, but visually all the crucial film scenes looked so flat or comparable with other classic films. More or less, everything is predictable, except the end twist.This is a one day tale. Most of the film takes place in one night with full of mixup and going after the truth. A gangster boss hires a hit-man for an important job that he must safeguard a bag till he arrive to get it in an isolated motel. During waiting for his boss, the bag man goes through unexpected events which eventually taking many turns, that comes to an end with a twist. With the limited cast, everyone got a fair share of screen.The actors like Cusack and De Niro are the advantage, but this is not an ideal film for such actors. Lately they and many other aged actors are into such films. So it is expected, but not expected to fail all their attempts. This film was okay, if you are not looking for a masterpiece thriller. Can be watched once, but instantly forgettable film. So film like this cannot be recommended, but if you decide to watch, don't expect anything other than just an entertainment or timepass. That is what it is good at.4.5/10"
