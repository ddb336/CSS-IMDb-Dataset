",-0.296,0.2985,2021-04-05 00:00:00,4,"Thank you Mowgli, you ruined the jungle! Shere Khan was right all along, you were the true villain of the story. Let's go back where the events took place and check out the farmlands, asphalt road, and cities! That's basically what you get when you let humanfolk settle on your land, dear animals! These are our bare necessities. Let's be honest: you don't wanna be like us. Even we don't want to be like us. We wanna be better. And we're not very good at it..."
" Perfection
",0.5719,0.92,2021-04-01 00:00:00,10,"An incredibly beautiful tale for the ages brought to life with exceptional craftsmanship. The CGI is next level, awesome pace and the cast is brilliant. Jon Favreau has done it again."
" Fun

" One of the best live action remakes
",0.6369,0.966,2021-02-13 00:00:00,9,"Excellent voice acting, editing, and CGI. The actor who plays Mowgli is also extremely talented. One of Disney's best live action adaptions of all the ones they've done. It does right by the original animated classic, which was a childhood favorite in my household. This version is very well done!"
" Pales in comparison to the 1967 animated one...
",0.0,0.9942,2021-02-07 00:00:00,6,"1st this is certainly not the first remake of the 1942 movie which was a bit of a different story and plot. While the 1942 movie was the original, it's usually the 1967 animated version from Disney that is best known. The 1967 one's plot has been done over and over especially in the 90s where several little kids TV versions and a badly chided movie were common. The first one was a great movie in it's 1940s time. Most people then thought it was great to be able to see all the animals. But now most people, jaded by better TV and movie productions no longer have interest in the really poor use of fake, stuffed animals used in the 1942 one.This 2016 version was closest in plot to the 1967 animated musical which is the most popular version. This one is not nearly as musically inclined like the 1967 one was. The animal songs in the 1967 one were exceptionally great. Frankly, I hope to never have to hear Bill Murray sing again as he did in this version. It was absolutely the most awful singing of ""Bare Necessities"". It was just absolutely out of tune and no sense timing. Murray sang it like he was drunk or stoned. Of course he thought he was being cute and funny. But frankly he ruined his song. The well produced bluesy, jazzy numbers of the 1967 songs were mostly mutilated in this movie. The one pleasant exception was Christopher Walken's version of the ""I wanna be like you song"". He added ape sounds to just the right places in the song so you knew it was the ape's song. But still pales next to the 1967 singing.The place the movie did excel was in the CGI creatures. The talking CGI animals were a great way to make the imagination grasp the crazy theme that is Jungle Book. That was a good deal better than the 1967 animations of the boy and animals jumping, hopping and climbing in very unrealistic animated ways. The plot was mostly the same as the 1967 one with only a few differences, mostly in it's ending.There's not a lot of sense in fully discussing the plot of a title that has been done over and over again. Not much to give away here. Almost everyone has seen some similar version of the Jungle Book. Just read the movie descriptions and you'll get what you need to know. One thing about this version is some of the big name actors that signed on to do voices. Just look at IMDBs cast list and you're bound to see some very famous actors and comedians.The problem with this movie isn't that it's a bad movie. It's not. But frankly I found myself wanting to go back and watch the much better 1967 animated musical version and did. If you are going to do a remake, you need to improve on the original as it will be compared with the other versions. And other than the CGI, this movie failed to be as good as the 1967 version it was modeled after."
" Mowgli was better and original
",0.6369,0.7003,2020-12-29 00:00:00,7,This is good ans since disney has a big budget it was watched more i guess. However the mowgli on netflix was much better than this.Give that movie a shot.

The graphic quality of the film is absolutely fantastic !!!"
" Better than the animated one!
",0.4926,0.9912,2020-10-20 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely love this film and have watched it countless times since it came out a few years ago. This version improves upon the classic, while keeping the same feel. Mowgli has some strong character development in this version and helps make him a well-rounded person, rather than the original where he's just a silly kid who likes to be with the animals. The cgi is able to depict such emotion and the acting is just phenomenal. I cannot believe the kid playing Mowgli spent his scenes in a studio filled with green screen and not actually alongside a panther and bear in the jungle. Not to mention that the visual effects are just stunning! The emphasis on the red flowers importance helps up the anti while centring the main conflict and, strengthened the characters motives. By doing this the narrative was elevated. Probably my favourite change is that they don't spend time in the man village. I love that change because it focuses the story on Mowgli and his connection to the jungle and his ""family"" there. No unnecessary human characters are included, which is great because I felt in the original they took away from the real point.
Overall I really recommend this film and believe it is Disney's best live-action remake."
" Incredible motion picture achievement.
",0.0,0.99,2020-10-19 00:00:00,10,"It's just about the perfect animated movie. And then it goes further, and delivers a sublime live actor composite masterpiece, and makes it look easy.The decision to use a real lead actor was brave. They pulled it off. The visual presentation is completely amazing, and the kid is simply brilliant in the role.All the voice actors sound at home with their characters. Bill Murray is a stand-out but they all do a great job. The writing is spot on, it's well scripted.The animation and design is a work of art. The cinematography and editing is tight and detailed. You can tell a lot of people stayed up late, fine-tuning every detail.More movies like this please.The story is entertaining, with action and tension, surprises and emotion. Nothing is overdone, it's subtle but bold. Efficient screenplay, never boring, flowing pace. I hope we see more animations and mixed animated live movies of this quality."
" You are never too old for a Disney remake movie
",0.0,0.9358,2020-07-31 00:00:00,6,"Especially if it's a good one like thatI insisted on watching the two ""Mowgli 2018"" and ""The Jungle Book 2016"".And what I picked up is that this one seems to be more realistic; from the animals to the places filmed, it's all much more realistic.The kid playing Mowgli is much more adorable and talented in 2018 than the kid in this one.The scenes captured in this one are more powerful though.
Plus the final fight scene with the tiger has also more potential."
" what a wonderful movie!
",0.6114,0.9904,2020-07-26 00:00:00,9,"It's amazing that Rudyard Kipling hasn't yet been relegated to the dustbin of colonial revisionist theory, along with similarly un-woke writers like Edgar Rice Burroughs, Mickey Spillane, and Ian Fleming. The Jungle Book has always been different, even when it patronizes white consumers.Okay, enough political malarkey...Favreau's vision of The Jungle Book is pitch-perfect. I do miss the great Phil Harris as Baloo, but Bill Murray's Balloo is lovable and entirely sympathetic. All the casting choices are terrific...I would argue with the reviewer who didn't care for Neel Sethi's Mowgli; the kid is no Olivier, but Mowgli doesn't require a great thespian, he has to be likeable and winsome, and able to elicit a little pathos (frickin' kid is an orphan...). The heavy lifting in Jungle Book is done by the animals, and this production is aces across the board.I'm pretty old, so I'm not very interested in how convincing the CGI is; I grew up with Rudolph The Rednose Reindeer and Godzilla Versus Bambi. To my aged, bloodshot eyes, this looks both seamless artful; I don't watch it and think ""gosh, this is technically amazing, these guys are special effects wizards"". It's about superior storytelling, not the craft of green screen editing."
" ""Shera Khan Always Gets His Man-Cub""
",0.0,0.9885,2020-07-17 00:00:00,7,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.I'll honestly go as far as to recommend this over the original 1967 version.I don't think is quite as charming as the original, and it has a very different animation style, both with great quality of detail in it. From the individual strains of fur, to the types of animals included (I've done so much research on Indian wildlife today), you can really see the details of the cg effects. Just watch the end credit sequence alone, and it'll prove it.There are 3 huge improvements to this versus others: Sher Khan's face, King Louie, and the intensity of the animal fight scenes. The movie isn't free of problems: I imagine someone will have issues with talking animals vs non-talking animals, that he'd have to learn the language (so how would he ever understand Sher Khan or Baloo?).If anything, I think the writing took a hit. Where the original had a subtle but strong fables sequencing to it (sort of modular moral stories with shifting focus on characters), this is structured much closer to how many video game stories are structured, serialized chapters with some level of power creep and shifting focus of environment and goals but all focused on Mowgli. And I don't think the writing is bad, but this Jungle kid (never actually reveals his backstory, somewhat of a relief honestly) is performing clean engineering using vines and pulleys and armor (that wouldn't work) with calculated positioning. I understand that some people just have talent for some things, but I had to question whether or not I could do the same thing. I could, but I'd have to do it different ways.And in all fairness some of the stupid /inconsistent things he gets up too, even though he's a ""take charge"" Mowgli in this version really got to me: I was literally cheering for Sher Khan at certain points.Ultimately I had a good time with it, and I think most people and possibly their pets will too (my cats were interested for a while)."

" Not Interested
",-0.3089,-0.8426,2020-07-09 00:00:00,5,"I wasn't really a fan of this film. I consider my concerns lightly because I watched it distracted and was slightly drunk, but from what I paid attention to, it felt commercial, lackluster, and predictable all the way through. It probably deserves a more appropriate rewatch, but as of this viewing, I wasn't impressed or interested."
" Eye candy lacking substance
",0.0,0.9899,2020-07-05 00:00:00,6,"Visually, this is almost perfect but the movie itself is a bit lacking, something that you don't expect from a Jon Favreau movie.I watched the animated version 2 days ago, so have it fresh in my memory for a comparison.This live action version is void of any humour. The animated one had me constantly laughing, this one barely a smirk from Bill Murray and that's about it.Packed with such a great cast, but some are under used (Scarlet Johansson) or mod cast (Christopher Waken is a terrific actor but I think he was the wrong choice for King Louie).Personal opinion, I preferred King Louie as a crazy Orangutan as opposed to the giant gangster like character presented here.Also, in the original the elephants were great characters with unique personalities, now they're completely void of any personality.I thought that the end was a little anticlimactic also. It was okay but was over too quickly.Another slight criticism, although for the most part everything looked so real, the faces of the main animal characters looked a little too human.What I really enjoyed, however, we're the fight scenes. The choreography of the animals fighting looked very realistic. They moved like real animals would, as well as being beautifully rendered."
" A worthy reimagining
",0.4404,0.9628,2020-07-05 00:00:00,8,Great joyous fun and a worthy reimaginingI wasn't expecting a riff on Apocalypse Now! Great stuff.
" Superb real life animation
",0.6249,0.9386,2020-06-30 00:00:00,10,"This is the standard to reach, I think, for blockbuster children's animal tales. This is still better than the recent Lion King in my opinion. It's bigger, with bigger characters and greater depth of situations, and funnier, with funnier characters and funnier lines. The fact that this story features a human child makes the coming together (or staying apart) of various animals far more logical. In any case, I'm not 10, but I really enjoyed this. Parents I think should be careful though. The animals are very, very real."
" Acting makes the movie
",0.0,0.9542,2020-06-28 00:00:00,9,"The portrayal of comedy, good and evil within the movie is phenomenal. Iris Alba's anger toward man, Bill Murray's range between humor, compassion and sacrifice. Ben Kinsley's guidance, all amazing performances. And the effects, showing you that if you forget what you are watching is not real, it was well done. However, Sher'khan following him into the fire? Not buying it. He was too smart. But that's a story issue. Thanks Fav for another masterpiece."
" Fantasy Forest, a masterpiece that awakens the world

The shaping of these characters has a certain concept of breaking the convention, but it also shows the personality of various people in this era.Not only that, the description of the red flower in the film is also unique, but it also warns the world to protect the environment. The red flower can bring warmth and hope to people, and it can also bring darkness and despair to the world.In the same way, the existence of each race has its indispensable family rules and beliefs. Just like the wolves, they always keep in mind their own family rules and beliefs. In the film, there are many scenes of chanting family rules. This also illustrates the lack and pursuit of faith in contemporary society. It is also a warning to the world in the film.This movie is very good, whether it is from the development of the plot or the creation of characters, it is reasonable and prudent, the logic is rigorous, and it has a vigilant value.

It's well paced, extremely well filmed and Jon Favreau's direction is incredible. The music by John Debney is excellent. However, it's brought down slightly by some of the changes feeling a little derivative."
" Awesome movie
",0.6249,0.9966,2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,"Rudyard Kipling's classic tale of a young boy brought up in the jungle by various animals is brought to life once again on the big screen in a fittingly wonderful way. Mowgli leads a peaceful and happy life with a wolf pack led by Akela (Esposito) and Raksha (Nyong'o) until the tiger Shere Khan (Elba) enters the scene, bearing an old grudge and an insatiable desire for revenge.If you go to the cinema to watch a movie that will draw you into a fantasy world of wonder, Favreau's retelling of this story - which so many of us remember from childhood - manages to weave that magic. We all know how the story plays out. With the panther Bagheera's (Kingsley) help, Mowgli (Sethi) tries to stay away from Shere Khan. He also encounters the devious python Kaa (Johansson), a super-sized orangutan with a soul-singer's baritone named King Louie (Walken) desperate to obtain the 'red flower'( which is fire) and of course, Baloo the grizzly bear (Murray). These are the key characters, but you'll also be delighted to discover a few new entrants along the way as well. It all builds on the charm of the 1967 film, which by itself is a must watch for any childWhile Sethi is of course, the only real person in here, all the animals have a fantastic degree of photorealism. And Sethi's interaction with the animals throughout the duration of the movie, given that they are CGI, is completely convincing. He combines innocence and warmth with the survival skills and resourcefulness of someone far older.
While Favreau is faithful to the old elements, (old songs like Bare Necessities included, of course) he also brings in a few new subtle touches as well in order to keep things interesting. While the King Louie scene is one of the many high points, Kaa's screen time could have been lengthened a bit, though. Nonetheless, the performance of the voice cast is spot-on. But more than anything, the intricate landscaping, masterful camerawork and environment (actually filmed in Downtown Los Angeles) create a delightfully immersive experience. Heartwarming and enjoyable."

" 'The Jungle Book' (2016) Review by Infectious Reviews
",0.0,0.9767,2020-04-04 00:00:00,6,"When 2016's 'The Jungle Book' hit the theatres it was well received. Critics were saying; ""As lovely to behold as it is engrossing to watch, The Jungle Book is the rare remake that actually improves upon its predecessors - all while setting a new standard for CGI"" - Rotten Tomatoes. Apart from Rotten Tomatoes' comment on the CGI - which is remarkable - I do not agree with its mention about its predecessors. First of all, I would like to say, watching this for the first time - I actually enjoyed it and even went out to buy it on 'BluRay'. However, the second time round, I found it was problematic and tedious.The character portrayals were not engaging in the slightest - there was no life to the hyper-realistic animals. With 'live action', you cannot display human-like emotions, nor have them dancing and singing through a whimsical script, as you can in an animated feature. 1967's 'The Jungle Book' manages to get away with it because it knows it is an animation. Theres no surprises and no alarms to say ""look at me! I'm an effect"". The whole point of an effect; is to simulate reality. Whilst watching 2016's 'The Jungle Book'; as 'good' as the effects were - it was not enough to make the characters candid and alive - especially when they break into song. If they had kept the story to the book, maybe I would have been inclined to change my mind about the 'life-like' animation. Even so, when the animals are not singing; their characters are forgettable and uninteresting. For instance, Shere Khan, voiced by Idris Elba (Zootropolis), does not have the same impactful evilness as Sanders. I admire Elba, but don't think he is a suited to this role. I think voice acting is something that every actor thinks they can do but in reality, everyone in this film, apart from Ben Kingsley's Bagheera, is wooden and boring - there is little activity behind the beautiful CGI. However, I do not think the, cash grabbing, A'list cast are completely to blame.Shift your hunting ground for a few years and everyone forgets how the law works. Well, let me remind you. A man-cub becomes man, and man is FORBIDDEN! - The Jungle Book (2016)The dialogue is neither here or there. Because the film is trying to balance out two narratives, the screenplay, written by Justin Marks, cannot keep up with - feeling rough and patchy. Having said this, theres a particular mantra, originally written by Kipling called ""The Law of Wolves"" - that is repeated throughout the film. This mantra is a code for the wolves and something Mowgli struggles to follow - as he is not a wolf. When Mowgli is on his search for acceptance he is also being told to leave the jungle. In the original story, Mowgli actually leaves the jungle and joins human civilisation but is later rejected, for being too wild. Kipling tells his story of not belonging and 1967's 'The Jungle Book' simply focus' on Mowgli's strive to literally stay in the jungle. 2016's 'The Jungle Book' looks at these two narratives, but cannot choose which direction to go in. At the end of 2016's 'The Jungle Book' - Mowgli defeats Shere Khan and stays in the jungle, but doesn't necessarily find acceptance. I understand that there is an upcoming sequel to Faverau's blockbuster. Maybe this will focus on Mowgli's rejection from human civilisation. However, I think all of this could have been told in one film. For these reasons, there was no need for another version of 'The Jungle Book', that told a different story, nor was there an example of a good remake. Why would you want to remake something that is already perfectly sound. This is the issue with a lot of 'Disney' reimagining's - they try to be something different, but because they try to please all audiences, the films end up being sloppy and pointless. This is apparent in 2019's 'The Lion King', directed by Faverau - not offering anything new. It was very tedious and had me just wanting to watch the 1994's original. Other 'Disney' reimagining's such as 2019's 'Aladdin' - slightly change the aspirations of some of the key characters. This has no effect on the overall narrative and takes away the basic themes such as everyones desire for freedom and opinion on power."
" Look for the Bare Necessities
",0.0,-0.3646,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I was really skeptical when this was announced because I didn't want to support unnecessary live-action remakes of Disney movies. (We're getting TONS of them. Really? Think of original stuff. Movies like ""Zootopia"" and ""Wreck-it Ralph"" prove you can if you just try hard enough.) However, it was the cast list that sold me on the movie. Everyone is perfectly cast. Bill Murray sounds just like Baloo when he speaks. (But not so much when he sings. When he sang it sounded too much like Louis Armstrong. It was way too throaty, and felt forced and out of place.) Idris Elba as Shere Khan was an absolutely perfect choice! Every time he spoke it was terrifying and sent shivers down my spine. The CGI blends with the live-action perfectly! Not once did it look fake. I forgot it was CGI. It's the most realistic CGI I've ever seen! I'm glad this wasn't just a retelling of the animated version. It's actually original. The only times I was reminded it was a remake of the Disney version was during the songs, and even then, the remakes of the songs were fantastic! It is a bit darker than the Disney version, so I would advise not to take a little kid to this. It really earns the PG rating. My one complaint plot-wise was the idea that ""man is bad."" I'm so sick of Hollywood pushing this agenda with films like ""Avatar,"" ""The Lorax"", and ""Rio 2."" It's absolutely stupid and was certainly not needed here. I agree with the message that it's important to respect nature, but stop beating us over the head with it.Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"

This film is endless and not a worthy successor. The animal special effects are impressive, but like The Lion King, creatures are expressionless. Watched this on 4k, after originally seeing it on the bigscreen, and my opinion remains unchanged. I honestly believe if they cut all links to the original, and allowed this to be a revision, this might've been different."

The Jungle Book.Jon Favreau's version has excellent CGI and it puts a darker shade to Kipling's animated adaptation.Mowgli is the man-cub raised by the wolf pack after being rescued as an infant by the black panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley.)However the Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) does not want Mowgli around as he fears that one day he will grow up and become his enemy, especially as Shere Khan killed his father. Mowgli has to leave the jungle and make it to a human settlement but he is rescued by Baloo the bear (Bill Murray) who rescues him from Kaa the python (Scarlett Johansson.)It is a bland movie when it could had been a great movie. I never found it flowed well, some of the animal interactions from the animated version are missing as well as the charm.Just look at when King Louis enters the proceedings. Here he is shown as a frightening and sinister figure, King Kong's baby brother who emerges from the shadows as Kurtz from Apocalypse Now.The Jungle Book is a technical marvel but at an emotional level it lacks the warmth and fun of the animated version."

The fact that he met with the bear, he was kidnapped by monkeys. It made the impression that the subject of 2-3 films was processed in a film.

" Read the friggin' book
",0.0,0.8598,2019-12-30 00:00:00,7,"First things first: I hate, and I mean HATE, the 1967 animated Disney film. Yes, I did like it as a child. But that was before I read the original Rudyard Kipling book. After that, the Disney film disgusted me, mostly because Disney took WAY too many liberties from the book, americanized the original material, and took out all of its dignity and seriousness. I went to see this second live-action remake (yes, there is a previous one from the 1990's) in hopes that it would be more loyal to the book, would have the book's gravitas, and would have nothing to do with the animated film. Or at least that there would be an equilibrium between fans of the animated movie and fans of the book. And DEFINITELY that there would be no songs from the animated movie. But I was wrong. My hopes were crushed. This film is practically a carbon copy of the animated film. It appeals ONLY to fans of the animated film, not the book. And much to my distress, it does reprise the songs ""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You"". When those songs came on, I actually involuntarily put my fingers in my ears and scowled up at the screen with rage and frustration. Not only was it embarrassing, it was pathetic. Oh, and top it all off with kids in the theater who sang along. For Disney cynics like me, this is pure torture. On the bright side, however, it is refreshing to watch a good old-fashioned family-friendly adventure film in the theater. One that also has a heart. Because of that, I have the generosity of giving this film a 7/10."

" Great looking, but confused
",-0.1027,0.9554,2019-11-27 00:00:00,5,"Out of all the animated movies Disney has chosen to remake, updating The Jungle Book from 1964 was probably the smartest bet. The original film is barely a movie and more a loose collection of vignettes that involve the same characters. Most of the songs are completely forgettable, and there's no real narrative drive propelling the thing from one scene to the next. Well, Jon Favreau did his best to address that issue from the original, but the film ends with such a confused series of actions that all seem to contradict each other that the goodwill established from making an actual movie out of the loose adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's stories can't quite overcome the final failings.Mowgli is a man-cub living with wolves in the jungles of India. In a particularly dry season, all the animals come together at a neutral watering hole where the rest of the denizens of the jungle see him for the first time, including Shere Khan, a Bengal tiger. Scarred by a man years before, Khan holds a grudge against all mankind and threatens the wolves because of Mowgli's presence. Bagheera, the panther who originally found Mowgli, leads Mowgli out of the jungle and towards the man-village where he really belongs.I do wish there was a bit more establishing Mowgli's life before this change comes over the wolf pack, but the motive is clear. Mowgli needs to leave to save both the wolves and himself. Mowgli, though, never really seems to buy into it. Whenever he's with Bagheera, he talks about how he doesn't want to go to the man-village, expressing a desire to live with the crocodiles instead. He doesn't know men, but he does know the jungle. He doesn't belong with men, he belongs in the jungle. Later, after Mowgli has been separated from Bagheera, he talks about how he needs to go on to the man-village but he obviously doesn't want to go. Meeting Baloo, the bear with a simply philosophy of coasting through life, Mowgli easily falls in with him. Up to this point, the movie's been pretty well constructed, but it's the introduction of King Louie that feels a bit out of place.We have our antagonist in Shere Khan, and he's been the only antagonist through almost two-thirds of the movie, and then we get an army of monkeys and their king, Louie, a gigantopithecus. He's wonderfully realized visually and I love how Christopher Walken plays him, but Louie comes out of nowhere late in the film to provide a visually imposing but quickly dispatched antagonist. He provides one piece of critical information to Mowgli that turns the film's narrative direction (that Shere Khan had killed the wolf pack's leader), but Louie feels like he's in the movie because he was in the original where he had one of the only two good songs instead of being a natural fit for the story.Mowgli, filled with rage, cut off from Bagheera and Baloo, and looking to get Shere Khan, embraces his nature as man and takes a torch of fire from the nearby man-village which he runs with through the jungle to the wolf den where Shere Khan lords. Lighting the jungle accidentally as he runs, Mowgli arrives for his showdown, and this is where the thematic thrust of the movie loses me.Up to this point, the idea has been the Mowgli is a man who doesn't have a natural place in the jungle. He's not a wolf (or a turtle, crocodile, or bear), and he should embrace who he actually is, a man. So, Mowgli grabbing the fire is him instinctively embracing that manhood, but then, facing Shere Khan, he throws the fire away, rejecting his manhood. It's not the choice I would have given Mowgli, but it makes sense up to this point. He's choosing the jungle over humanity. Seconds later, Bagheera pulls him aside (well, pins him) and tells him that he can't fight Shere Khan like a wolf would, he needs to fight Khan like a man would. Mowgli gets a big smile across his face. A moment before, he had thrown aside the main sign of humanity in the film (fire, the red flower), and then he's smiling at the idea of taking up other forms of humanity (using tools)? It's...inconsistent. It also indicates to me that he's embracing humanity.After a fight that leads to Shere Khan's death, I would expect Mowgli to say a sad goodbye to his friends in the jungle. He doesn't belong there. He used fire to burn large portions of the jungle. He used tools to kill a tiger. He obviously belongs in the man-village, but instead we get a vision of some kind of multiculturalism where Mowgli is caught somewhere between man and jungle. It feels very wrong for what came before like the writer (Justin Marks) and director (Favreau) wanted their cake and to eat it too.That frustration makes me sad because for the first half of the film I was quite on board with what was going on. The movie had real structure. It looks great (and may be the best looking of these live action remakes from Disney). The cast is top-notch (with special notes for Idris Elba as Shere Khan and Ben Kingsley as Bagheera). And yet, the structure falls apart in its final act to fit in King Louie and the thematic material gets confused."
" Great to watch
",0.6249,0.9957,2019-11-03 00:00:00,9,"Perhaps the best live action remake Disney has made, The Jungle Book shows you just how flawed The Lion King remake was. From it's amazing ""non politically"" picked cast to CGI animals that actually show emotion when they talk. It is truly a masterpiece of a movie. Neel Sethi (Mowgli) gives an amazing performance given he's interacting with CGI animals that aren't in front of him. Of course it helps when your voice acting cast are actual actors. Idris Elba as the tiger Shere Khan, is perfect, you really feel his vengeful spirit. Bill Murray as the lazy but lovable bear Baloo is hilarious. Ben Kingsley kills it as the wise panther Bagheera. Scarlett Johansson as the seductive giant snake Kaa was really good. Christopher Walken gives a creepy but awesome performance as the giant Orangutan King Louie. The reality is that this movie was perfectly casted and you feel the results throughout the whole adventure because the animals do feel alive with emotion. You never feel like someone is just reading a script in a booth (like you do many times in Lion King) and that helps deliver the message of ""accepting others even though different"" very well. The story is not a complete copy of the original (unlike Lion King) which helps give it more freshness. I don't know how director Jon Farveau's (he directed both Jungle Book and Lion King) two movies could feel so apart from each other in quality. Perhaps Disney executives got involved in the casting of the most recent movie? The original Jungle Book is not a very popular animated film in my opinion, so maybe that's why Disney selected actors and not singers for this one."

I hope many other tv series, movies we used to watch be brought back to life. But there is a down side. This generation has somehow lost the touch of simplicity. For e.g.If you have seen the animated version, try comparing the feel of the movie and the one you see in this one. You'll understand what I mean. The graphics, voice over's in today's movies are so amazing that they bring a sense of reality, which is good but kids might get scared. The target audience are not kids! That's what I feel. Adults will love it. Good chances, kids might ask their accompanied to break halfway through. Nevertheless, This is one and a half hour of your childhood. Do not miss it! :)PEACE OUT!"

",0.0,0.9505,2019-08-20 00:00:00,6,"The first time I watch this version of 'The Jungle Book' I perceived it as a bad movie, because it was slow, not intriguing and it had a darker tone than the animated (it's not joyful as that one). After the second rewatch at least two years later I have to say it's not as bad as I thought, but it's not very good either. Technically is great: direction, music, photography are all on point and the visual effects are stunning. The story is simple and linear with no plot holes but on the other hand I found myself really bored for a part of the first act and for most of the second one. The parts I preferred were the old (but revisited) songs and everything after the meeting of King Louis because it is when the movie finally picks it up a little bit.
This 'The Jungle Book' version is fortunately not a copy and paste in digital of the original one, but there's clearly the willingness to give another read on the story and another tone. Although this work is done properly I found myself preferred the animated version because it is more enjoyable than this one, which I felt is unable to entertain for too many time."

",0.0,-0.9742,2019-07-20 00:00:00,5,"I have 3 major problems with the film, that causes the rest of it to be ruined for me.1. Shere Khan's motive for hating mowgli. In the original book, Shere Khan hates mowgli because he thinks he will grow up into a man and kill them, in the far superior cartoon version its for the thrill of the hunt. He loves to kill and the feeling of hunting. He's basically the predator. But in the movie he wants to kill him for the same reasons as the book, fine. But once mowgli leaves the jungle, he still wants him. It makes no sense why he is still after him.2. Lack of kaa. Even though the character was pointless, he was fun and unforgettable. He got 2 scenes, but everyone remembers him as one of the main parts of the story. So, what do they do with the character here? One scene. No jokes, no song. Some stupid back story for mowgli that makes mowgli hate Shere Khan, but still doesn't explain why Shere Khan hates mowgli. They totally understood why we love the character in the first place.3. The ending. The one thing that you have to get right. The one thing that the story guarantees throughout the film. They messed it up. The entire moral of the story. Gone. What else is there to say?Cgi is great. Voices are fine. But the 3 things above ruin the entire film for me."

I was stunned and hooked for live. I have the music on vinyl and CD. I own it on video, DVD and Blueray. I showed the movie to my own children and they loved it. They watched it over and over again, and so did I. I must have seen it about 200 times and still love it.This version however didn't disappoint me at all. Right from the start, I got the same feeling as in the original 1967 movie. It has the same vibe. It pulled me right in, like not many movies do. The music is recognizable and well performed. It's a great tribute to the original! I love it! Of course, to me, the original will always come first with 10 out of 10, but for a Disney remake, this movie is worth an solid 8! Very entertaining!

Just like 'The Legend of Tarzan', the film was shot entirely in studios. With film technology developing as fast and effective as it does, 'shot on location' might soon be a thing of the past. I predict the technology will become so good and so cheap that films will be made in a studio with everything else being added via computer in post production. Sad, but true.Neel Sethi is the only real actor in the film, portraying Mowgli. Being his first feature film, it must have been very difficult acting to...well, almost nothing. I must say, however, he did a very good job. Its interesting, though, that everything in the film looked so real, from Mowgli's interaction with the animals to him walking in the forest, and yet a scene of him just running through a field looked incredibly fake.'The Jungle Book' is a spectacular action adventure drama for young and old. I honestly did not expect this film to have so many jump scares, so be warned! Shere Khan was by far the most impressive creation in the film, and also very scary.

On the one hand the effects were cool and it was interesting to see the different direction but at the same time it would be interesting to see a more faithful adaptation of the book.With that being said it's an awesome movie though I wished they had focused more on the book in terms of some of the characters such as Kaa. In the book the snake is a friend of Mowgli unlike the adaptation's. this would've been a good opportunity to change that and they didn't.With all that aside I enjoyed it. The movie's about an orphan named mowgli who is raised in the jungle by wolves after being brought to them by Bagheera when he was a baby. His happy life changes when the brutal, misanthropic tiger Shere Khan sets out to kill him forcing him to go on the run. Along the way he meets a bear named baloo who teaches him the ""bare necessities of life"".You've seen this story before but what makes it interesting are the effects used to tell the story. The effects are amazing and breathe new life to the characters and the world they live in. The actors have great chemistry with each other.

While it is true that one shouldn't compare a book and the movie, except the name and the characters, the movie has almost no soul that the book or even the animated series (Japanese versions) has/had. Akela dying at Shere Khan's hands, Kaa(a female?) trying to gulp Mowgli and so on - a series of upsetting alterations ! Shere Khan is undoubtedly portrayed as a fearsome villain, even Bagheera, to some extent, meets the standards but Baloo, Ka, Grey Brother etc. have fallen from their standards, even the ensemble cast of the Bunder Log is pathetic. Except Shere Khan telling Raksha's kids a story in his wily way, the movie almost has no reflection of Kipling's Masterpiece. Baloo's and Bunder Log's songs do provide a 'feel-good' factor but the background score is average.
I wish that instead of picking up such classics and morphing them to wind up in a movie less than two hours, it is better to create movie in several parts like a trilogy or series. If you can sacrifice the nostalgia and the philosophical depth, the movie is tolerable."

That being said, the latest in these adaptations, The Jungle Book (2016) certainly surprised me.Unlike some films like Maleficent (2014), which takes a different point of view from the main story of Sleeping Beauty (1959), and more like Cinderella (2015), which covers the same material as its predecessor, Cinderella (1950), The Jungle Book takes the main ideas from Rudyard Kipling's book, via the animated interpretation of The Jungle Book (1967) and brings the adaptation to near perfection. While The Jungle Book's classically animated predecessor certainly had its moments, a lot of its appeal fell to obvious popular culture references (like the Beatles as vultures), and a number of catchy and flashy song-and-dance routines. As a result, I can't honestly remember what the plot of the original film was trying to convey. This was why I was quite impressed with director Jon Favreau's adaptation: the plot was direct and made sense, while also highlighting man's ability to create useful (as well as deadly) tools. It was clear how Mowgli (Neel Sethi) needed to adapt to his strengths to survive in the jungle instead of just hanging around with his animal friends. Also, the clear distinction of the connection between him and Shere Khan (Idris Elba) created a much-needed tension to the story.Some will recall that The Jungle Book has already been made as a live-action film with The Jungle Book (1994). However, advances in computer-generated imagery over the years have made the ability to create talking animals a mind-numbingly realistic endeavor. The voice acting cast for this version was pretty spot on, and the pacing was fantastic. What's more, there still were snippets of songs and subtle pop culture references (my favorite being the cowbell in King Louie's (Christopher Walken) lair), but they didn't distract from the flow of the film.A superior film to its classically animated predecessor, I give The Jungle Book 5.0 stars out of 5."
" frustrating because it could have been a really amazing movie
",0.2944,-0.7836,2019-02-28 00:00:00,7,"The Jungle Book is visually impressive, the script is very promissing and Jon Favreau are at his best as director, but it fails miserably in the most basic: the protagonist. It would be an excusable mistake only if the story didn't relied so much in Mowgli. And don't get me wrong: when a child actor is bad in a movie it's not his fault, he is just a kid, the guilt is entirely of the casting director and of the director. It's frustrating because it could have been a really amazing movie!"
" An overrated movie!!!!
",0.0,0.9628,2019-02-21 00:00:00,5,As we all know that the movie is an adaptation of the novel by Rudyard Kipling and tells us a story about 'Mowgli' a kind adopted by wolves. The movie is just another movie with pale acting by the lead character and doesn't give you the feeling of a wow. There is no script and direction and sequence is direction less. I am still not able to understand why the character of money king was introduced in the movie probably just to drag the movie. A good script could've made this movie a good movie although kids will surely love this movie.
" Visual effects are so powerful
",0.5598,0.5406,2019-02-19 00:00:00,7,Visual effects are so powerful that virtual animals and children walking next to them can hardly tell the truth from the truth. The changes of light and shade and the flow of hair can be chaotic.
" Would Let Kids Watch This with Caution
",0.0,0.985,2019-02-15 00:00:00,6,"Alright, I'm gonna be honest here. The Mowgli in this film did not make the same expression all the way through the film. Some reviewers of this film in this website were not paying attention and were merely complaining subjectively instead of being constructively critical and objective. Songs that were in the original The Jungle Book were actually more upbeat than this 2016 version. Yes, this film's version had a more dark and violent vibe to it. Which could make some parents prevent some children from watching this. Sure, the adults who admired the 1967 classic may feel disappointed by this from it not regurgitating the same old feeling the much older masterpiece captures. Disney is not in the business of cowering down to the audience's expectations too much, though. Disney's goal was to make this remake for luring profit in its money vault in order to make better films that are more original and fresh as possible. This is why remakes and sequels of films that have less quality than their predecessors exist. In order to make monetary gain to help make something better come along. By my surprise, I actually liked this adaptation that is 3 years old because it was closer to realism than the cartoon's interpretation."

" For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack
",0.7506,0.9962,2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Walt Disney Pictures have produced two live-action remakes of their famous 1967 animated version of ""The Jungle Book"", the first from 1994 and this one from 2016. The story (unlike that of the 1994 version) is essentially that of the cartoon. Mowgli, an orphaned human boy or ""Man-cub"", has been raised by a pack of wolves in the jungle after being found abandoned as a baby. The wolves decide that Mowgli should return to the ""Man-village"" because he is being threatened by the savage man-eating tiger Shere Khan who has a particular hatred of humans. The task of returning Mowgli is undertaken by the black panther Bagheera, but along the way he falls in with the laid-back, carefree bear Baloo, who tries to persuade him to stay in the jungle.This ""Jungle Book"" does, however, differ from its illustrious predecessor in a number of ways. It is, for example, considerably longer; the 1967 version was only just over an hour in length. The wolves play a much more important role than they did in the carton, where they fade out after about the first ten minutes. The treacherous snake Kaa, a male character in the original, here becomes female with a notably sexy voice, not surprising given that she is voiced by Scarlett Johansson. The elephants no longer march along in military formation. There are several minor characters not found in the cartoon, including a porcupine, a rhinoceros and a squirrel, but those singing vultures are dropped.Disney took some flak for making the original King Louie an orang-utan on the grounds that orangs are not actually found in India. This was, apparently, the reason why he here becomes a gigantopithecus, a member of a prehistoric species of giant ape. As, however, this species died out around 100,000 years ago it cannot be said that this marks a move towards greater zoological accuracy. As in the original, the most memorable character is undoubtedly Baloo, voiced there by Phil Harris and here by Bill Murray. Murray's characterisation, in fact, is fairly similar to Harris's, and Baloo remains a loveable, happy-go-lucky layabout.The greatest difference, however, is that this film is much more serious and darker in tone than the light-hearted, family-friendly original. It raises serious questions about the need to protect the environment and the need to work together, often backed up by some apposite quotations from Kipling's ""The Law of the Jungle""). (""For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack ""). There are fewer songs, although ""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You"" both reappear. King Louie becomes a much more threatening figure than his comically blustering equivalent in the cartoon. The same is true of Shere Khan; the cartoon character voiced by George Sanders with a plummy, upper-class English accent was about as threatening as a pantomime villain. Idris Elba's character here, more streetwise thug than suave gentleman, is far more frightening, although (or possibly because) an explanation is given for his hatred of humans. No character is killed in the original, not even Shere Khan who is merely driven off. Here there are several deaths.In one respect I think that the film is better than its predecessor, and that is the ending. Having Mowgli return to the Man-village because he has fallen in love with a girl always struck me as a cop-out, partly because both he and the girl are young children, and young children do not generally fall in love with one another, and partly because the jungle is the only home, and the animals the only friends, he has ever known. This film gets the ending which the original should have had; the threat from Shere Khan having been removed, Mowgli gets to stay in the jungle with his friends.I didn't like the 1994 film, which is more Bungle Book than Jungle Book, but the 2016 version represents a big improvement on that mediocre offering. It will never supplant the original in my affections, but then that was a treasured part of my childhood and I still regard it as one of the greatest children's films ever made. The new version, however, has its virtues, including excellent characterisation, both on the part of the writers and on that of the voice actors, an exciting story, a winning young hero and some first-class computer-generated imagery to create the animals and scenery. My one caveat is that its darker tone might make it unsuitable for young children. 8/10Some goofs. As in the cartoon, Mowgli's name is consistently mispronounced. (Kipling indicated that the first syllable should rhyme with ""cow"", not with ""slow""). Baloo is referred to by Bagheera as a sloth bear, a species found in India, but he looks nothing like one. He looks far more like a grizzly, a variety found only in North America."
" Takes itself too seriously
",-0.1779,0.8468,2018-12-27 00:00:00,6,"The Jungle Book takes itself too seriously. There are moments of whimsy, but they almost feel out of place compared to the rest of the movie.

King Louie is sinister and was expecting some humor from his side... They could have worked more on this character, also Kaa was also as a snake is supposed to be, chilling, and he, now a she, could have some more work. Also I miss the vultures... I understand it's a remake but the original jungle book has so much humor... This one tried to make a cocktail humor then horror and it seems a bit artificial after seeing the original movie, too many things out of place that are hard to swallow.

" Jungle Book : Jon Favreau has a thing for children films
",0.0,0.9747,2018-12-08 00:00:00,8,2016's Jungle Book is Jon Favreau establishing himself as a talented filmmaker in his own way.Elf (2003) was his first which I loved personally. It was a really good Christmas film with wit and humor.The Jungle Book also has the same structure making him a master in his own genre.Characters from the loved book are built very naturally and closed to the heart and it is amazing.The storytelling is suspenseful as well as lovely. Through Kaa and King Louie he builds on a perspective storytelling reminding of ELF.Must see for anyone who loves children films and especially Jon.Overall - 4/5

" A fantastic movie, but probably not suited for children
",0.3182,-0.2716,2018-11-19 00:00:00,9,"The Jungle Book follows the story of Mowgli, a foundling child who is raised in the jungle by wolves. When animals fear he will become a danger to the forest when he grows up, the panther Bagheera tries to guide him back to the human world. Mowgli is pursued by the tiger Sher-Kahn, who wants to kill him, and he meets Baloo, a bear whom he befriends.
I have learned to be sceptical of Disney remakes and sequals, especially the live-action remakes of the last few years. I felt that, usually, they didn't add anything new or overall be any kind of improvement over the original. This one, however, is truly remarkable: It resembles the story of the original book more than the first film, it has absolutely amazing visuals, and has well-written characters. Especially Sher-Kahn, the tiger, is more interesting in this version because he has actual motivations and reasons for his desire to kill Mowgli, and we get to know more about Mowgli's relation to the wolf pack where he was raised.
However, it probably isn't suited for children, as it is quite violent and features scenes that can be quite scary for children at times. If they want to watch a movie, then it would probably be better to show them the old movie."
" Incredible remake
",0.0,0.9914,2018-11-15 00:00:00,9,"I quite enjoyed the original The Jungle Book; it's a fun, light-hearted musical. But I enjoyed the 2016 live-action remake even better.Mowgli is a ""mancub"" raised among the jungle animals - specifically the wolves. Although he tries hard to be a wolf, the fact that he is human remains a handicap. He is often told ""that's not the wolf way"". When a drought hits, the river drops, exposing the ""Peace Rock"". During this time, all animals can come to the water to drink and not be harassed. However, Shere Khan shows up. And while he won't harass or eat anyone while the drought lasts, once the river rises, he will return for Mowgli's blood.After much argument by the wolves, Mowgli leaves, as ""I don't want to see anyone get hurt."" Bagheera helps him, intending to take him to the man village.However, things don't go to plan. Mowgli doesn't want to go. There are a series of adventures and close calls.The movie is quite exciting. It's a bit rougher (as in more violent) than the original, and some scenes may be scary for young children (my then-5-year-old brother cried at one point the first time he watched). I didn't like the small religious element of the movie, either. However, I did like the movie's themes. It's a fun and exciting adventure.But it's also got INCREDIBLE special effects, which really raise the benchmark.A truly brilliant movie."
" very scary
",-0.5413,-0.4404,2018-11-13 00:00:00,3,This movie was too spooky and scared me very much.
" Even Christopher Walken couldn't save this boring mess
",-0.7752,-0.9079,2018-10-05 00:00:00,1,"Right off the bat the story is painfully predictable, there's no excuse for it. Even as an adaptation this movies does nothing new with the characters. ""Why was this movie made when the original is still good?"" Is the stigma that these live action recreations of animated classics have to carry and this movie fumbles right out of the gate (by the way the answer to that hypothetical is that someone wanted money, that's obvious so moving on). Let's break down this movies failings1. The main kid can't act, his line delivery is painful. the dialogue is also really, really bad and predictable. I caught myself completing dialogue sequences multiple times until I had to stop myself.2. None of the characters work. the trailer and poster all show Kaa (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) which is the only character that sorta works but her scene is short and pointless in the overall story. 3. Most scenes are pointless in the overall story. the excuse that this is a kids movie is no excuse at all. most scenes do not work with each other or lead in to other scenes.4. The fact that most ""actors"" in this ""live action"" retelling are CG animals is a problem compounded by the fact that Mogli can't act. to be fair the kid probably had to talk to a lot of tennis balls on sticks and that can be hard (see Olsen's performance in Avengers 2 whenever she had to interact with Ultron) but there is a serious disconnect with every character on screen even when the animals talk to each other.5. Every veteran actor in this sounded like they read their script the morning before they had to go on. The worst example of this is Bill Murray, pay attention to his acting and its clear he didn't want to be there. The only ones that were not phoning it in where Scarlett Johansson and to a lesser degree Christopher Walken and that's probably because he was one of the few singing performances.6. There is only one complete musical sequence, and its with Christopher Walken. If you're a fan of hairspray you are in for a treat, even if its brief. This movie threw away damn near everything memorable about the original and didn't replace it with anything new and it shows with its lack of musical sections. 7. The new Ending is bad. it has a hamfisted message that I think is supposed to be pro-environment. I say I think because it was not delivered very well. Minor spoiler, Mogli is hounded for most of the movie because he's human and the tiger Shere Khan wants him out of the jungle because he thinks Mogli will bring ruin to the Jungle. In the final confrontation Mogli steals fire from the local human village to fight Shere Khan and he brings ruin to the jungle. Mogli is supposed to learn something from this I think but like I said, not acted or communicated very well.In brief they stripped everything fun about the story. If you like the original animated Jungle Book I would be surprised if you found anything good in this. if you want a live action Jungle Book movie it's been done better before. if you want to see a live action retelling of a Disney animated classic go watch the only good one that tells a new and interesting story, Maleficent."
" Entertaining Kids Movie
",0.4404,0.506,2018-09-07 00:00:00,7,My Rating : 7/10Excellent CGI work. A fun movie to watch if you have couple hours and don't care much for anything too specific and just want to be entertained.Pick it up for sure.
" Visually Stunning
",0.3818,0.987,2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Walking into the theater I was prepared to be underwhelmed with this movie. I was sure that the reviews to an uneeded disney reboot were biased and the very handsomely paid cast was just a showing to reel in fan bases of all the diverse actors. However, this movie exceeded my expectations. The graphics in this movie are absolutely incredible, near breathtaking, and similar to the visual sensations in Life of Pi. There are times in the film where it seems Jon Favreau (spelling? idk) can not decide whether he is catering the film to children or an older generation. The beginning of the film seems incredibly innocent but then progresses into an incredibly violent series of animal planet like encounters. I found myself thinking quite often that children really would be probably very frightened of some of the animals, particularly Shere Kahn. Aside from all this though, I find the film entertaining, and frankly quite funny. I think it perfectly uses human emotion and relationships to allow the audience to feel genuine loss when the hero fails and genuine happiness when he triumphs in the end. Beautifully shot and endlessly entertaining, I believe The Jungle Book deserves a high review."
" The Bare Necessities and More
",0.0,0.997,2018-06-12 00:00:00,8,"I think I saw the original back in 1st grade and didn't care about it at all except for ""The Bare Necessities."" So flash forward to present day when we have already had Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, and even Snow White redone. I had zero excitement about the update of The Jungle Book.Then I started to become curious. I read articles about how newcomer Neel Sethi did pretend basketball for his audition tape because of how much green screen and nothingness he would be working with. And I will start with Mowgli because he is fantastic. Think of Life of Pi as a reference point. But then think of a kid's imagination and why people might have fallen in love with the original in the first place. This kid brings the movie to life, and there wasn't a moment I wasn't impressed by him.Now for the jungle. It is beautiful. I have no idea how they were able to accomplish it, but it's so stunning. In an extended compliment, I tip my hat to Iron Man and Elf director Jon Favreau. Whether it's the placement of the animals or the way the camera moves with the jungle, the man knew exactly what he was looking for and he got it.Mowgli isn't quite on his own; you have an all-star cast lending their voices with Bill Murray, Idris Elba, and Christopher Walken being the highlights. Not only do they add with their voices, but the animals they represent are such a feat to behold. I loved how the camera would trail Mowgli talking to Bagheera the panther and the way the shoulder blades moved in stride with the walk. The look is there, the behavior is there, and the characters are there.The next thing is both a compliment and also one of the complaints I hold. The story arc follows Mowgli as he has all these different encounters with the creatures of the jungle-- whether for better or for worse. For the most part, the encounters are brief, for this movie had to be under 2 hours while still having scenes with all these different animals. And while segments with Kaa (Scarlet Johansson) or King Louie are welcomed, the main character isn't given much time to spend with Bagheera or Baloo; this is a problem becomes we're supposed to feel this bond grown that even though Mowgli is a man cub, he will instead choose the life with the animals he loves. And his interactions with Bagheera and Baloo are fantastic, but they don't provide the depth and framework that animated and kids movies often fall prey to. Furthermore, the two songs played are a great relief of pace, but they can't help that some scenes I described as brief still feel stretched. The pacing isn't quite there, and the development of the story suffers for it.There are moments that will probably scare some children, especially when the red flower is introduced, but the animals presented and the diverse characters they represent are fresh and needed. And there's no doubt that Bill Murray fits the bill as Baloo the bear. Top it off with the beautiful jungle and some borrowed elements of The Lion King, and well, you have one of the most exciting Disney films of recent years. You will enjoy it in the theaters, but perhaps not as much as you would hope to.

",0.6369,0.9833,2018-06-10 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie in theaters and was blown away. I don't remember too much of the original animated film, but this was a nice refresher. We get CGI animals and CGI backgrounds, and one human boy (who is real). The animals were all well-done and their voices were superb. If this is what the CGI Lion King will be like in 2019, then I'm all for it, even without humans. The wolves were the best of the CGI animals, especially the pups. The pups sounded just like human children! I'm not too sure about the Oscar winnings but this gets a standing ovation, Oscar or no Oscar. It's a good Disney remake."

I guess every kid saw that movie at least once in their lifetime. I was pretty impressed by the cartoon on a big screen. Now so many years later you get a decent adaptation of that cartoon with real looking animals. For the visual effects this movie is worth a watch, maybe not an Oscar worth movie, but still it is enjoyable. Certainly with the whole family, because it's more a kid movie than anything else. But adults can enjoy this movie as well. Seeing critics on here giving this movie the lowest rating possible is just ridiculous. You really never saw a worse movie? You must not watch alot of movies then. The Jungle Book is exactly what I expected it to be in 2016, a good adaptation of Rudyard Kiplings' book on big screen. And that with big names as narrating voices."
" TERRIBLE casting, otherwise great
",0.0688,0.042,2018-04-20 00:00:00,6,"This could have been a fantastic film except for the casting. Bill Murray is barely passable in the spoken parts but his singing is atrocious. It always has been this way, going all the way back to 1976. Everybody knows he can't sing. It totally ruins what was the number one song in the original Disney film. I had to watch the original all over again to wash Murray's off-key, lousily timed groans out of my ears.
Scarlett Johansson is great at speaking in a dull monotone voice without any soul or expression. For her to be cast as a seductive enchantress is utterly ridiculous. There are dozens of actresses who could have knocked this out of the park. Terrible casting.
Christopher Walken did an okay job with the speaking parts but this man, like Murray, has absolutely no sense of musical time, Again, a major casting mistake.
As for Gary Shandling, he is a lousy voice actor. Dozens of actors could have done a far, far better job. If Disney had hired a casting director with any talent whatsoever, this could have been one of the best films of the decade. Again, there are a ton of great casting directors out there. Disney has no excuse. The producers have no excuse. I was very disappointed."

I was impressed with the cast (English) after the trailers but in the movie they don't have the same effect. May be the Hindi version will have a soft corner for Indian viewers because of the song (I saw English version), but apart from that I don't think there is much new in the movie. With just over 100 mins of playtime, I don't see how they could have done justice to the book or the TV series.

But I dgress...), I thought that without Neel Sethi's truly hexceptional performance, this movie could have TANKED. Not since Anna Paquin's Oscar-winning performance in 'The Piano' have I seen a child actor so utterly unaffected and BELIEVABLE - top marks, in my book - witch, frankly , is a MUCH better one than half the commenters here seem to be reading from!).I grew up on Rudyard Kipling, thanks to my Mum, who got it from HER mum, and to all those know-nothings who found this ""too dark"", I say ""oy vey""! I especially snorted at one 'cotton-wool-wrapper' parent, who worried this film would be MUCH too dark for most 11-year-olds. Are you KIDDING me?? Y'know I could try to re-educate sincerely misguided folks like you right here right now, but I have better things to do with my time - just Google ANY article on the BENEFITS of Grimm Brothers' original unbowlderised versions of the classic fairy tales instead, & let the rest of us get on with the REAL bizness of preparing our children for the REAL world out there, m'kay?

" Unnecessary live-action remake
",0.0,-0.9813,2018-03-24 00:00:00,3,"THE JUNGLE BOOK is one of a slew of live-action remakes of famous Walt Disney cartoons currently in production. I say live action, but this version has exactly one actor - the Indian-American kid playing Mowgli - and the rest is made up of CGI animals. Sadly, it's a massive misfire of a film, in which almost every element disappoints. Neel Sethi is a first-time performer and it shows, because it has no acting ability whatsoever and a single expression on his face (sullen, mildly puzzled) no matter what situation he finds himself in. The CGI animation for the creatures ranges from the decent (the adult wolves and panther look pretty good) to the poor, but the main problem with this is the incessant CGI action and limited storytelling ability. It reminded me a little of the STAR WARS prequels with the necessity of having CGI in EVERY single shot, but there's no weight behind it and no gravitas to the story. The tale's thrust seems to have been stolen from THE LION KING, of all things. As for the voice talent, it's occasionally decent (Bill Murray works), but Idris Elba is miscast as the bad guy and Scarlet Johansson sticks out like a sore thumb."

This mish-mash of new-age sentiments and zingy, slangy one-liners wrapped up in special visual effects has about as much to do with Kipling's wonderful adventure book as the Kardashians have to do with Oxford University. It's directed in a campy, wanna-be-cool style that can best be described as neo-faux Hollywooden car-chase. It uses animals instead of crash cars, but it boils down to much the same thing.Why (oh, why?) do film makers take wonderful books and trash them? Why do they take a genuinely moving tale and turn it into cotton candy? This movie is the cinematic equivalent of junk food."
" The Jungle Book balances the intensity of its source material with the charm of the Disney animation.
",0.4019,0.9969,2018-02-24 00:00:00,7,"Immediately I want to start by saying I was never a fan of Kipling's book or the animated adaptation. It's just a story I never grew up with and it never resonated with me. Having said that, I believe Favreau actually crafted a blockbuster that shares qualities from both ends of the spectrum. You all know the story, Mowgli being raised by a pack of wolves is hunted by the fiercest tiger of the jungle. He flees with the help of a panther and a bear and soon discovers his true identity and where he belongs in the world. A charming adventure that feels like a cutesy Disney feature but beneath the visually impressive surface lies a darker and more mature film. Containing various metaphors such as politics and laws, humanity's impact on the natural world and the lust for power and control. It's a difficult balance to get right. Some will want more of a musical quality so that they can gleefully sing to the songs that these animals randomly burst into. I'm personally not a fan of this, so I'm glad this was kept to a minimum although ""I Wanna Be Like You"" is horrendously performed by Christopher Walken. On the other side of the spectrum, literary aficionados and connoisseurs who crave deep and meaningful symbolism will want a narrative fuelled by dark metaphors. I would happily have had a super depressing adaptation, but we don't live in a world where we are graced with such gifts, however there are some complexities included for the more mature audiences. Visually, it's absolutely stunning. The blue screen, wildlife CGI and Neel Sethi (who really did hold this film together) accompanied each other beautifully. Couldn't fault it. Voice acting was spot on, particularly Bill Murray as Baloo who's natural wit suited the role. Well paced and directed, although Favreau got a tad bit excited in the finale where the camera became too frantic intertwined with quick cuts and dim lighting. Too safe? Perhaps. In the end, it's perfectly good family entertainment."

",0.4939,0.4493,2018-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Mowgli (Neel Sethi) was raised by vegetarian wolves who taught him English, which some animals speak while others do not, and some only at the watering hole. He is hunted by a tiger (Idris Elba) and forms an alliance with a panther (Ben Kingsley) and a bear (Bill Murray). The snake (Scarlett Johansson) perhaps the most interesting if not sexy character was a walk on.The story line was rather dark and might scare younger children. The musical numbers which highlighted the original production sucked in this film with Christopher Walken being a lead singer. Neel Sethi can't carry a note, but sings anyway. It was as if Disney couldn't get all the musical rights from Disney. The graphics integrated with a live boy was incredibly good and has come a long way from Mary Poppins.The theme of the film is one of diversity and ""It Takes a Village"" (or a pack)... I think."
" A mark for vivid visual treatment
",0.0,0.9948,2018-02-15 00:00:00,7,"Every time I got fascinated about this movie like everyone because of two reasons. The first one my jealousy of those people who experienced this film in theaters (especially in iMax) because I'm not able to watch this film on the silver screen. The second reason is the reason of everybody, that's the powerful use of visual treatment. Hollywood movies, as we knew are the great treasures of visual beauty and colorful treatment. But Jungle Book is far apart from those kind colorful productions from the early masterpieces like Matrix, Avatar and many more. It is something a vivid way of representation of the new technique collectively known as vfx or Visual Effects. I'm stunned with the maximum utilization of that technique to the utmost and I just went into the forest along with Mowgli (like another man-cab). It's been something a film not about the new technique which is used (as far as concern it is an old technique according to Hollywood movies) it sustain here, in my mind cause of the apt and correct use of visual effects and make the movie live to the audience. Apart from my applause to the Animation films ( because this is something closely connected to Animation films) it is a great and enormous visual treatment to any kind of film lovers (People who love any kind of films not concerning which genre it is)."
" Could have been great! (Spoiler free)
",0.6588,0.997,2018-02-05 00:00:00,8,"This is just a typicall example of how Hollywood doesn't have an inspiration when it comes to movie stories. This movie is just everything you ever saw in either an animation movie or in a movie in general. Yet critics were blown away in the case of this movie just like they were with ""the shape of water"". This movie is a fun adventure in the jungle nothing more. It's basically ""the lion king"" but with a kid instead of a lion. Everything this movie's storry had for me I've already seen it in either ""the lion king"" or in another movie. The story is without doubt interesting and somewhat mature but it doesn't have that suction of the viewer in it like the classic jungle-based movies had it. It is although very nice and entertaining to watch it but it's not as captivating as you would expect. Another problem is the lack of background for some characters and some events that influence the main conflict in this movie. Aside from that there was another thing that bothered me: the performance of the kid who played Mowgli (don't know his name). His performance was very underwhelming and at certain points cutted my elan and interest in the story. The villain was however very good. He started pretty typical but by the he end of the movie all the pieces come in place and you see its full character and motives. The voice acting was formidable especially from the guy who played the bear, Scarlet Johanson and Ben Kingsley I guess who played the panther. Another thing that made me enjoy this movie and liked it as much as I did was the visuals. I mean honestly how could human beings do this? How much work was there in the visuals for this movie? I mean it! It's like 90% of the movie is CGI and is seamless. There are moments where I couldn't know if the environment was real or just CGI. That was achieved maybe due to the great cinematography that made the transitions between the two almost unnoticeable. The score was good and it enhanced he movie quite a lot but at no point I was impressed or left wondering how thematic and musical it is. Anyway in conclusion this movie is just a typically entertaining Hollywod-jungle movie with fabulous visuals, great voice performances but with some originality issues and a underwhelming performance by the lead actor. 8/10"

" Enjoyable and good-looking family film
",0.4404,0.9935,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'The Jungle Book' is the sixth (?) adaption of Kipling's 120 year old story, probably best known to everyone from Disney's 1960s version. This time it's live-action - well, it's not a cartoon, but has such great CGI animals you spend most of the time trying to figure out if they might be real! Pretty sure everyone knows the plot - a boy, Mowgli (Sethi) is abandoned in the jungle and raised by wolves/a panther, until a tiger comes to kill him. It's a little longer and darker than the cartoon version, but it does do away with the nasty vultures.It's still a family/kids film at heart, but there's definitely a few scares and proper tiger v bear/panther/wolves fights! Not sure I'd recommend anyone take a child under 8. The film does a great job of bringing the wolves - Raksha (Nyong'o) and Akela (Esposito) as Mowgli's 'mum' & 'dad' - into the story more, as they're his true family. Kingsley as Bagheera the panther is stately and perfectly cast - a great mentor for Mowgli. Like the cartoon, the main gripe I have is: where is this jungle? Africa? We see rhinos, armadillos and buffalo. India? Tigers and monkeys. South America? Panthers and pythons.And then the bear - Baloo (Murray). Either way, Murray has some great lines, but seems a little underutilised... the one big letdown for me was the songs - the 'Bare Necessities' is sung nowhere near as well by Murray, and while Christopher Walken is suited to King Louie, he does a horrible version of 'I Wanna Be Like You'. Regardless, the score is great, the scenery/CGI fantastic, Shere Khan (Elba) us very menacing and Favreau (coming off 'Iron Man 2' and 'Chef') keeps the pace up, while allowing some sentimental moments."

" A stunning retelling of a classic story
",0.3818,0.9512,2017-11-22 00:00:00,9,"Mowgli is a child, referred to as a 'man-cub', who has been raised by a wolf pack in the jungle. He tries to live like a wolf but clearly he isn't. Things go well for him until the tiger Shere Khan learns of his presence in the jungle; he was injured after an encounter with a man and cautions that Mowgli will grow up to become a man and thus a threat. He demands that the wolves hand him over to be killed but they refuse. Mowgli sees that he is a danger to his animal friends so leaves with the panther Bagheera who intends to take Mowgli to the man village. They are separated and Mowgli encounters various other jungle animals; some that are friendly others that present a danger. Eventually he must inevitably face Shere Khan.This appears to be a live action film but apart from Mowgli just about everything is computer generated it is just so good it looks real. The story is simple enough so viewers of all ages should be able to follow it however some scenes may be a little too intense for younger viewers. The scenes where animals fight look surprisingly real. The voice cast, which includes plenty of top actors, including Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken, Scarlett Johansson and Idris Elba, does an impressive job bringing their animal characters to life and young Neel Sethi does a fine job as Mowgli. People familiar with Disney's '60s animated version may expect plenty of songs; this version just includes a couple; these are rather fun and don't detract from the more serious tone of most of the film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this splendid film to everybody apart from younger children."
" Easily one of Disney's best live action movies ever!
",0.784,0.9978,2017-11-11 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie the night that it came out in theaters, and I was blown away by it! I remember growing up watching the original animated movie from 1967, and the trailers for this, and I got very excited for it. And, believe me, it did not disappoint me. First up, is the special effects. Simply put, these effects are phenomenal! The jungle looks absolutely stunning, and is a very beautiful world to look at, and the animals look so real! Speaking of which, this film features more species than the original did (e.g water buffalo and a pangolin). Then, there's the acting. Once again, fantastic! Neel Sethi played Mowgli perfectly, and had such wonderful energy and charisma! And, Bill Murray, for the most part, was very well suited to play Baloo. Ben Kingsley did an amazing performance as Bagheera the panther, playing perfectly the part of a stern, yet wise and caring mentor figure. Christopher Walken gave a very interesting performance as King Louie, making him somewhat of a mix between King Kong and the godfather, which is a stark contrast from the Jazzy clown that Louie Prima gave in the original movie. But, then, there's Idris Elba, who plays the role of Shere Khan, the tiger. This incarnation of Shere Khan is incredibly tough, reminding the audience that he is the biggest, baddest bully on the playground. Which reminds the audience of why every creature in the jungle is afraid of him. And, I will admit, when he killed Akela, it made me jump in my seat. Thanks to Elba's performance, every line said by Shere Khan sends shivers down my spine. And, finally, the script. It follows the story of the original film very well, and it doesn't take too many liberties. It also pays several homages to the original, like when they played the overture from the original movie at the beginning of the film. It even uses elements from the novel that both films are based on. For example, the code that the wolves always recited throughout the movie was actually a poem from the original novel. The concept of the water truce was also taken from the book, and the film uses a few quotes from the book as well (such as when Raksha tells Mowgli ""You're mine, mine to me."") Overall, The Jungle Book is easily the best film of 2016. I would highly recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the original movie, and to anyone who was a fan of the novel."
" Excellent live-version of Disney's 19th animated classic!
",0.6114,0.9803,2017-11-10 00:00:00,9,"This is the live-version of Disney's 19th animated feature film, The Jungle Book. It is an action-packed and fun-filled adventure, featuring the boy Mowgli, who was raised in the jungle by a pack of wolves. While he loves his life living with the wolves and befriending a host of other animals, his life is threatened by the man-hating tiger, Shere Khan, who vows to kill him. This results in an exciting and fast-paced adventure of escape and endurance for Mowgli. While the animated version is whimsical and full of comedy, this film has a more serious tone. It gives you a closer look at each animal character and Mowgli's interaction with them, particular the relationship of Mowgli and his wolf mother and more confrontation between him and Shere Khan. Also, King Louie the Orangutan is a more menacing and reckoned figure in this movie. I love the added suspense and action in the story, from Bagherra the Panther battling it out with Shere Khan to Mowgli showing off his tricks and survival skills in the jungle. Of course, it's a treat to also see the carefree and adventurous Baloo the Bear and the cunning and sly python Kaa.It is one exciting journey to the next as Mowgli meets these host of characters one by one, each one having his/her unique brand of humor, mission and personality that is a treat for the entire audience to watch. I enjoyed listening to the voices behind the animal characters and to hear the some of the catchy songs again, reprised here from the animated film. Great fun!Grade A"
" See it only for the great computer generated effects and not for the lame tale of a boy raised by wolves
",0.753,-0.7574,2017-11-07 00:00:00,5,"Based on the Rudyard Kipling novel, The Jungle Book, a Disney production, finds its inspiration in the earlier 1967 Disney offering, an animated production of the same name. With its computer-generated effects, the new Jungle Book is far superior to the old one in many ways. But is that saying much? The 1967 effort resembles a bad episode from Yogi Bear or The Flintstones, hopelessly dated, juvenile and nothing to look at.For those unfamiliar with the plot, our protagonist is the pre-pubescent Mowgli, the ""man-cub"" raised by wolves in the jungle, led by Mowgli's mother figure, Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o), with the pack leader Akela (voiced by Giancarlo Esposito). Mowgli is played by newcomer Neel Sethi (the only human actor in the film). Sethi fails to prove absorbing not only because he's wholly too bland for the part but way too young to be pitted against the malevolent and ferocious antagonist, the brutal tiger Shere Khan (effectively voiced by Idris Elba). It's a little hard to believe that such a young kid can have success doing in a tiger who is bent on causing his immediate demise. Of course it's not all Sethi's fault since Mr. Kipling insisted on such a young protagonist, instead of a teenager, which might have been a tad bit more believable.I found it a bit odd that all of Mowgli's allies were predators. Bagheera (Ben Kingsley), a leopard that rescues the boy, is kind enough to deliver Mowgli to the wolf pack, who also have nurturing instincts. And what of Baloo the bear (voiced by the always amusing Bill Murray)? He too bonds with Mowglil for a while. Only Shere Khan and perhaps Kaa the Python (Scarlett Johansson) live up to their reputations as dangerous predators.Why also don't all the animals talk? If Mowgli's allies and opponents all have voices, why don't the noble elephants talk as well? Despite their nobility, they're all still relegated to the world of beasts— forcing one to wonder why they too don't have anthropomorphic abilities.The Jungle Book's strong suit is the aforementioned computer-generated effects. The movements of each species are wonderfully realized especially in the scenes involving life and death confrontations (Shere Khan is particularly scary even when he's not going in right away for the kill). Some of the highlights of visual wonder include Mowgli's retrieval of the honey for Baloo, King Louie's tantrum inside the ancient Temple and Shere Khan's final pursuit of Mowgli, who emerges triumphant.One true moment of awkwardness comes when King Louie, the giant ape, sings what appears to be an homage to Louis Armstrong. The decision to cast a Caucasian actor (Christopher Walken) in the role of the ""Gigantopithecus,"" was designed to stave off any claims of racism, as the tune is clearly designed for an African- American singer (Walken's rendition is still too reminiscent of Armstrong, with the link between a black man and an ape, obviously still a source of uneasiness).One final lost opportunity is Mowgli's possible reunion with humans at film's end. We never get to see what happens with the kid returning to his progenitors along with the prospect of some new interesting conflicts. Instead, man's triumph over the animal kingdom is emphasized, pointing to the harnessing of fire, as the critical factor in homo sapiens' ascendance.See The Jungle Book only for the visuals. And if you have young kids, make sure not to bring them along—some of predatory activity is a little too realistic for such young eyes."

So basically, the film is 95% male, at minimum, and of the two minor female roles, one is a stereotype. In an animal film for kids there should be an even gender split.

" Absolutely excellent! Best Jungle Book Movie to date!
",0.8766,0.9472,2017-10-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie is indeed an improvement, way better than the original. Very creepy and dark, scary not only for children but also adults like myself, a legit Disney horror movie. However, this whole picture, except for the main character, is CGI – all of the animals, with no exceptions, right to the jungle itself. They were not real, but they look so realistic that you can't help but live the illusion. It was animated in a way it would put AVATAR to shame, it's beautiful, never lacking of wonder and a sense of dangerous adventure. Moreover, it received acclaim for its story and characters. Let's talk about those characters:– The hero, Mowgli, the young human boy raised by wolves – or rather the ""man-cub"" as he's called –, is portrayed by newcomer Neel Sethi. For me, Mowgli is the best character in this movie, because Sethi's acting was superb, he knew how to act with things that were not there, and was not at a loss like most child actors are; on the contrary, he was acting confidently. Basically, he's a little boy playing a little boy trying to find his place. And that is the main focus of this movie: a story of self-discovery, in which a feral child searches for his identity, and tries to survive in a hostile environment. He is confident and curious, exploring his surroundings with confidence and unease alike; he can be stubborn, but never so as to be whiny, unlike his animated counterpart who was so annoying with his stubbornness that I never cared for him. Sethi as Mowgli wants to live in the jungle, his true home, but still he knows the dangers of the green hell, especially Shere Khan. Hence, in every minute, I cared for Mowgli and felt empathy for him; and needless to say, I was always at his side whenever he was in danger.– The antagonist, Shere Khan, is voiced by Idris Elba. While he is not the best character in the movie (that distinction goes to Mowgli), he is still the best animal character. Elba voiced the embodiment of pure evil, a big cat with a deep, bone-chilling voice to match his disturbing looks. He voiced him with a thick Cockney accent that can scare the living sh** out of you, with a deep voice that constantly goes from low, gentle whispers to loud, blood-curling screams, mixed up with real tiger growls. It was the first time I saw an actual scary Disney villain, by far scarier than most of the animated villains – believe it or not, I dare even say he is one of the scariest villains of all time, both Disney and non-Disney! This ferocious feline is an improvement upon the original because we saw a lot of him in the movie – and in that way, I understood why he's considered to be the biggest threat to Mowgli's life. Plus, I remember being furious at him for being so mentally deranged, showing his inflammable hate for Man that he clearly shows no tolerance to Mowgli and no will to let him live, and hence I never wanted him to win. But I was still terrified of him for allowing his desire of killing the boy to turn into an obsession. To make the story short, Idris Elba as Shere Khan is ungodly creepy and scary, frightening and terrifying no matter what he does.– As for the side characters: Bill Murray as Baloo is hilarious, lovable and caring for Mowgli, much like the original, but sadly I hated him for being most of the time self-interested, something his animated counterpart was not. Scarlett Johansson as Kaa was more frightening and manipulative than her animated counterpart (the fact of changing the character's gender is innovative, mostly because the animated film lacked female characters, and also because the giant constrictors we fear are actually females), but she sadly had only one scene. And I have mixed feelings about Christopher Walken as King Louie – from the trailer, I never appreciated him, though he can be creepy. On the other hand, Bagheera is brilliantly portrayed by Ben Kingsley, since he's shown to be more tolerant and open-minded, and less whiny than the original. The same thing is said about Giancarlo Esposito as Akela. But the best of the side characters is definitely Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha, the caring and loyal mother to her cubs.Like all great films, the 2016 JUNGLE BOOK certainly has its good sides as well as its flaws. Here's the thing: all those who loved it (me included) couldn't help but point out its flaws, and all those who hated it had enjoyed some of its moments! But nevertheless, the Favreau film is an improvement, especially in its story. Of course, it is a remake of the 1967 movie, but not a copy-paste remake like the recent BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. On the contrary, it was faithful to both the animated film and the Rudyard Kipling books, while at the same time, it was telling its own story, mostly focusing on the conflict the main character is going through as well as the menacing villain. And because of that, it can be considered as a true JUNGLE BOOK adaptation – I daresay, it's the best JUNGLE BOOK film to date! Of course, it isn't perfect in comparison with the book, but it still has its elements. For example: the animals call themselves ""People"", recite the Law of the Jungle and come together in a Water Truce proclaimed by the Peace Rock; they have their own language, for they call fire ""the Red Flower"", and see elephants as the creators of the jungle, very much like the books. But again, it isn't the perfect adaptation – the upcoming Andy Serkis version appears to have that distinction. Still, the Favreau movie wins."
" A Disney Fail
",-0.5423,0.8441,2017-10-13 00:00:00,5,"5 stars for the great graphics and because Bill Murray was Baloo. As for the rest of the movie it was abysmal. Christopher Walker butchered King Louie's song, ""I Wanna Be Like You"". Walker is not a singer! While Bill Murray did well singing ""The Bare Necessities"" both songs seemed like they were added in as an after thought. Sethi did OK playing Mowgli, as dealing with a green screen is hard for a first movie, but he seriously lacked something when compared to other child actors. He definitely needed more emotion to his voice and acting lessons. While the graphics were great and the story line basic it seemed to be missing the Disney magic. Disney 1994 Live action of the Jungle Book was 20 times better. I was left disgruntled and in shock of how badly Disney failed on this one. I'm crying in side knowing that they are planning on make a sequel. I hope the Warner Bros. version that comes out in Oct. 2018 with Andy Serkis as the director leaves me a lot more satisfied."
" A family adventure!!
",0.4374,0.9915,2017-10-09 00:00:00,8,"First of all, I think 9 out of 10 people can agree that this was a fantastic film and that it was outstanding in nearly every aspect of it. The Jungle Book is a live-action/CGI fantasy film that retells the story of Mowgli, an orphaned human boy who is steered and protected by his animal guardians that have become his parents due to circumstances that have already been notified. It shows the story of Mowgli who has set out on a journey of self-discovery while dodging for his life (literally) the threatening Shere Khan. Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli and does an excellent job at that, the casting team made a very clear cut decision. Throughout the film he is the only human that actually appears on the screen apart from the beginning when we get a glimpse of his father trying to protect him from Shere Khan. The computer generated imagery (CGI) is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the most realistic to appear on screen for a long time other than Tarzan (2016) in which it was so believable it didn't even enter my mind at some points that it was CGI, with the development of digital technology this is becoming and will start becoming more of a convention and it will also appear on our screens. I think the main reason as to why this has always been such a successful film is because the storyline never gets old although it does follow Todorov's theory of Equilibrium it will still be told for years to come and I'm sure that there will be many more editions made of it. In addition, the casting was brilliant throughout I mean lets take a second to appreciate Bill Murray as Baloo, the man is a legend!! Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. The cinematography and videography as well as nearly all other film aspects were on point although it was largely influenced by the use of CGI it was still very much focused on.

I did love the movie as it was exciting and full of action throughout the whole movie. Shere Khan is what you call an absolute terrifying mofo. Glad that nigga dead. On some points i see serious comparison with the Mongol conqueror Dzjengis Khan, maybe they are related?"
" Better than I thought
",0.4404,0.9764,2017-10-06 00:00:00,7,"This movie is better than I thought. I know it is hard to emulate the greatness of the original, which is so much fun, and timeless. Despite lack of humor, the 2016 version holds its own in the making. The CG here is top-notch. All animals look amazing real. I almost believe they can really talk. The story is also easier to follow compared to the original. Even though it is a bit less fun, it is compensated by more exciting fight scenes. I personally love the characters in the original more as they are so cute, even King Louie is lovable in the original. But I can't say I don't like the characters in this 2016 version as it looks more real. All in all, this version will make Walt proud."
" Great visuals, just messed up the story
",0.4019,0.9972,2017-09-11 00:00:00,7,"Did anyone ask for another live action remake of The Jungle Book? Well, someone did, and we got it anyway. Was it better than the other versions? Not so much better than the original cartoon, but better than the Jason Scott Lee version from 1995. I do believe they did pick the right director in Jon Favreau though. Now, I loved the book. And I loved all the characters from the book. Truthfully, one of my favorite characters is Kaa. And in this movie, there is only one scene with that snake and yet again moved to an antagonist role, making him/her the role of the cobra. Like Kaa several of the other characters weren't even used in the right way. Some were killed off rather quickly, and others weren't even used in a speaking manner. It just seemed the filmmakers took out a poll on who everyone thought the best characters were and used them instead of the others. One of the worst parts of the movie was that they changed the ending considerably. Not in a good manner either. It hurt the movie the most in my opinion. The ending was always the best part of the other versions. Mowgli walks out of the jungle to see someone he finds absolutely beautiful. They walk off together and everything works out for everyone. Even the animals. Here, Mowgli stays in the jungle. Where's the joy in that? It's nowhere, that's where. I'm not saying the entire movie was bad. The dialogue worked great. Showing how Mowgli grew up with the animals trying to do better than them was a brilliant idea for the movie. The best part of the movie was the animation. Most of the animals did look quite real, however there was one flaw. Yes, the animals are bigger than Mowgli, but they didn't need to make the animals bigger than what they were. Kaa was the exception. He/She was always bigger than most pythons (at least they didn't make the snake an anaconda). This is a great family movie. Get the kids together, a big bowl of popcorn, a nice couch to cuddle up on that would fit everyone reasonably, and enjoy this movie. I know your kids would.Rating: 7 out of 10That's it for me folks."
" Rating: A
",0.0,0.9953,2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"From the moment I discovered that this film was going to be 100% shot without any natural landscapes or in an actual jungle, I was also 100% sure that it'd suck. I mean, a 1h30 movie with only one real character in the middle of a CGI environment? It has to be terrible ... Or maybe not. Not at all ... It blew me away! This movie is surprisingly astonishing, near perfection I would say!The CGI is fantastic! I got to a point where I looked at something and asked myself, ""Is that CGI or is it actually real?"". All the locations and characters are marvelous to look at and I watched this movie in 2D so I cannot imagine how amazing it looks in 3D. It' a delight for critics who are always so focused on every inch of technical details because there isn't a single flaw, there isn't one scene where someone could say, ""Oh, those eyes are not OK"" ... Clap, clap, clap, to the special effects team, they really pulled off a masterpiece!For the technical part of the movie, I'm done, there's nothing else to say besides that it's just perfect. Nevertheless, the pros don't end here: the cast is brilliant, each character has a very suitable voice, especially Bagheera (Ben Kingsley), Shere-Khan (Idris Elba) and Baloo (Bill Murray). Both Ben Kingsley and Idris Elba bring their A-game, their voices are so powerful and deep that every scene with them is so captivating, and with Shere-Khan even more since the whole screen would focus on him when he appeared. The tiger is such a huge presence, he's scary, menacing and haunting which is great for a villain. Bill Murray played a lighter character: Baloo is the funny, lazy bear that sings the traditional songs with Mowgli and helps him be who he really his (using his ""tricks""). Bill Murray's voice is perfect for Baloo and he's the one that got some laughs from me.I don't really have a major issue with this film, the plot is well handled, it's fast-paced and the characters are all captivating and they seem so real that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Still, if there's someone that could have been better it's Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli. He's pretty good, but there are some scenes where he can be a little irritating and doesn't know where to look at (however, this last one I understand, it can't be easy to act the whole time with a green screen in front of you, especially for a young actor). I definitely didn't like Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), a snake that straight up exposes Mowgli's past through her hypnotic tricks. She only appears in that scene in the whole movie, so I'm sure they could've revealed his past in a much better way, other than pure exposition.This is the best adaptation of the Jungle Book so far, without a doubt! It's the movie which kids from this generation will grow up with and I'm more than happy for them. It surprised me in the most unbelievable and gorgeous way, it's an amazing CGI work! Absolutely recommend it!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"

That Shere Khan, Bagheera, Raksha were animated...really!!. . .R u serious?. . God!! their circumstantial detailing will leave you at awe.. Can't stop myself, the honey collection scene will bring multiple smiles, giggles on your face (not spoiling more, see yourself), yes, Balloo stood out to be my favourite with all those witty lines stuffed with humour (Bill Murray, u r awesome) Each time the Majestic Sher Khan announces himself, audience get onto their toes then the jungle dwellers, yes!! I mean it. Try holding back your tears as the legend slowly wraps up taking its own chunk of time. The JUNGLE BOOK is not a movie, it's an emotion where the only dude driving the epic is, our little hero Mowgli. You'll fall in love with Gray for sure.. not only Gray, all those tiny little cutie pies jumping, dancing doing all sorts of cute stupidities..man, they are diabetic sweet.This movie is not to be rated (IMDB won't allow that), Just go, LIVE it...

The visual effects are stunning, the actors do a tremendous job, the story was juicier and had more invested than the original, and it was a thrill a minute. Jon Favreau did a great job turning the original film into a big, blockbuster phenomenon, and I can't wait to see his future projects that utilize the same technology (Lion King 2019 for instance).

" Furry cozy jungle animals
",0.0,0.9563,2017-07-21 00:00:00,6,"07222016 I am giving 6/10 to this 100 years old courageous story. The movie created many lovely jungle animals, they live harmony and peace together, except one bad tiger. CGI effects almost took everyplace in this movie, except the little boy actor. However since I watched at home, so I couldn't experience the amazing 3D effects as theater view would have. Therefore my review can only base on storyline and characters. In addition, I never watched the old cartoon, hence I couldn't cherish the past with others. Pro, animals image are very furry and cute. Their hair still looks beautiful from computer.Con, Most big lose of this movie is the forest fire, it took all my good feeling away.. In a moment, I cant agreen the tiger no more, human can only know destroying. Beside, Jungle Book and Zootopia both released in 2016. I feel lucky I once chose to watch Zootopia in cinema but not the Jungle Book. Overall, still a great story for kids. May you and I always keep children's simplicity, and stay positive of life."

The Disney people turned it into a miserable cartoon, then made this monstrous calamity of a movie. Yes the animals look great. The voices are not bad. But the story is wrong, Bagheera did not find or raise Moglii. The other inaccuracies are appalling. Why take a Nobel prize winning book, then wreck it? The story is slow, incorrect for far too much of the movie, the characters are sluggish, and it has no charm. It has taken me this long to watch it as I was so afraid they would do something like this to it. There is no suspense, no engagement, just boredom. Get a copy of the book, fall in love, and leave the movie to, rot."

It was not noticeable to see things looking corny with how the mouths moved. I also, love how the story changed to a whole difference of problems and how they were presented and yet the story was almost three times better presented this way. I also loved how they introduced the apes and monkeys they were so beautiful to watch. The animals that were also chose for this film were beautiful to examine them speak and move. The movie also had beautiful scenery. This was hilarious with the monkey song who ever the singer was I was crying of laughter with the evolution part for his hunger to be like humans."
" Disney breathes new life into classic 'Jungle'
",0.0,0.9781,2017-07-04 00:00:00,8,"Disney has been on a tear with its live action adaptions of its 2D animated classics, and 'The Jungle Book' is an example of one that has found a major audience with families across the globe. Based on the 1967 original (which was based on the Rudyard Kipling novel), 2016's 'Jungle' really ups the ante on the number of animated animals and brings all elements of the jungle to life.With a screenplay from Justin Marks and directed by Jon Favreau, 'Jungle' brings its A-game on all fronts, including a who's who in voice actors, from Bill Murray as the lovable Baloo to Sir Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, as well as appearances from the voices of Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson, Lupita Nyong'o and Idris Elba. Each of the animals portrayed by these actors actually feel like they are living, breathing things, and newcomer Feel Sethi as Mowgli does an excellent job interacting with them, especially considering they are all CGI.Aside from the obvious, what 'Jungle' does really well is it captures themes of family, identity and acceptance. There are a few key scenes that are touching enough to pull at the heartstrings of anyone, and a few lessons that are learned along the way, as well. In this sense, 'Jungle' is a feel- good film that has few (if any) flaws, which explains why it has been embraced by so many.'The Jungle Book' is an example of how Disney continues to innovate and breathe new life into the stories that have made the studio empire what it is, and it's likely we will continue to see similar efforts in the coming years."

There is a nod to a couple of the more popular songs from the 1967 version. Richard Sherman updated the lyrics slightly for 2016. Bill Murray voicing Baloo will leave you in stitches! Christopher Walken as a menacing King Louis Scarlett Johansen at Kaa and a MASTERFUL Ben Kingsley as BagheeraFrankly I LOVED this version and will definitely be going back for a second look. The CGI is just spectacular.Stay and watch the first half of the credits for a whole mini story book and stay for the second half of the credits to see the ENORMOUS number of people required to pull this off.
" A very beautiful film that honors and respects the original.

I was one of those kids. The plot is the same: Mogli, an orphan boy, found in the Indian jungle by a panther and raised by wolves, has to flee from the threats of Shere Khan, a Bengal tiger who hates humans and vowed to kill him. The great difference of this film, however, is the use of a lot of CGI features, first quality, that give it an enormous realism and visual beauty. Its a visual spectacle, with excellent cinematography, beautiful and vibrant colors, good contrast, pleasant light and depth. We could even believe that those animals could exist. Some are beautiful (the wolf mother, the panther), others are funny (the bear, the porcupine), others are cute (wolf cubs), the snake mixes well seduction and fear, the king of Monkeys impress us by his size and the tiger is truly terrifying. Much of the film reproduces famous scenes of its worthy predecessor, in what we consider to be a worthy homage. The most iconic songs have also been kept here (""Bare Necessities"" or ""I Want to Be Like You""). Voice actors are well known to the public (Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley and Scarlett Johansson, just to name three of them) and do an unblemished job. So, I believe I can say that this film is one of the most interesting creations that this studio created during this decade. Truly worthy of the Walt Disney legacy."

Normally a remake would seem pointless, but this version just blows the cartoon version out of the water in every way. It's visually astonishing with the worlds and animals (a well-deserved Oscar win for the Visual Effects), that you'll really feel immersed into it. The animals are all played well by A-list performers. Sir Ben Kingsley plays Bagheera with genuine authority and conviction, Bill Murray plays the old lethargic slacker to perfection, Lupita N'yongo plays the motherly role of Raksha like any real mother should, and Idris Elba makes Shere Khan really feel like a genuine threat when you detect every ounce of vengeance and malice in his voice. I'm really grateful they included the two most memorable songs from the cartoon as well and hard to believe that Bill Murray would actually sing ""The Bear Necessities"". Even the ending is way more satisfying that I won't reveal it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. This is way too good to miss."

It is very well animated and produced, but the plot it presents is mediocre, boring and predictable, lacking any trace of fun or entertainment.

" Well realized remake of a Disney classic.
",0.2732,0.8008,2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"The Jungle Book is one of Disney's many current, and upcoming, live-action remakes of its animated classics. Jon Favreau directs this movie with an energy that's similar to the original movie, yet it actually diverges from the 1967 film quite a bit. There's a greater subplot on the 'Red Flower', an the wolves are more prominent characters in this take, and it's light on the musical numbers. So: familiar but different.It's odd that Disney is remaking a select few of its classics into live-action. And so far, the results seem to be working (with the exception of Maleficent, for me at least) quite well. They take a movie that is familiar to the general modern audience and change it up with some small but significant aesthetic differences. It's a bit hard to describe.This whole live remake thing does bother me in one regard though. How the hell will Disney carry-out its announced projects of Winnie the Pooh, Dumbo and The Lion King? I PARTICULARLY don't see the Winnie the Pooh one working well.The Jungle Book: an unnecessary remake or creative re-imagining? I'd go with the latter.

" Doesn't Really Add Anything New, But Worth It For Visuals/Voices Alone
",-0.0387,0.986,2017-03-20 00:00:00,7,"There is no doubt that the 1967 ""Jungle Book"" is one of the most iconic Disney films of all time. As such, it was going to be difficult for this 2016 version to live up to the billing. Whenever I'm watching a direct remake of an existing property, I like to ask myself ""is this adding anything new to the proceedings?"". While ""Jungle Book"" potentially fails that test (a darker, more serious tone would be the biggest change from the original), the visuals are so astounding and the voice-acting so incredible that it still manages to be an entertaining, engaging experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Jungle Book"" tells the story of Mowgli (Neel Sethi), a young boy abandoned in the forest and raised by the wolf pack, ostensibly led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o). One day, however, feared king of the jungle tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) confronts the wolves and lays down an ultimatum: ""man cub"" Mowgli must leave the jungle (or be killed) before he turns into a full-fledged man. Not wanting to cause trouble, Mowgli volunteers to leave, setting off with Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) the panther to begin the journey back to the man-village. Along the way, however, Mowgli meets such colorful characters as Baloo (Bill Murray) the bear, Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) the serpent, and King Louie (Christopher Walken) of the apes.When evaluated strictly in terms of plot, ""Jungle Book"" was a middling effort for me. While it sets an understandably darker tone than the original and tries to weave a few more human aspects into Mowgli's character, I can't say that I was ever impressed by any specific plots/messages/themes throughout. It isn't ""bad"" either, per se, but just not all the compelling plot-wise.There are two areas, however, where ""Jungle Book"" shines and turned into a fun viewing experience for me:1. The incredible visuals. I don't believe I've ever seen a film where the animals look so close to their real-life forms. Clearly, expert digital craftsmanship (and likely thousands of hours of painstaking time!) was put into every pixel. Short of watching a nature documentary on the Discovery Channel, this is the closest you'll ever get to feeling as if you are actually in the jungle. A fight between Shere Khan & Baloo/Bagheera towards the end of the film had the hair on the back of my neck standing up! 2. The voice-acting. Much like its predecessor, this film also casts the perfect voices for its plethora of jungle creatures. None are boring, all sound beautiful/unique, and each brings a special flair to their characters.So, though I am usually more plot-focused when it comes to saying I enjoyed watching any given film, ""Jungle Book"" was a bit of an exception to the rule in that it completely overwhelmed me with visuals/voice acting. Even if this '16 version never rests on the same pedestal as the original (and let's be honest herethat isn't going to happen), it is a worthwhile achievement just for the technological advancement in digital animation alone."
" Never manages to sell the illusion
",0.0,0.9788,2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"Jungle Book is a marvelous technical wonder, that deserves to be praised for the excellent acting of its young leading actor. It can't have been easy to act in front of so many green screens to animals that aren't really there, and to make it seem like he is actually looking at them. But that aside, the movie fails to sell you on the illusion completely. You are constantly aware that you are looking at CGI animals, and it is distracting from start to finish. Don't get me wrong, occasionally the animals look almost lifelike. And the way actors and animals are integrated into the environments is really well done... but it's not enough. The main antagonist, does not look like a real tiger, and you see a lot of him. Many other main characters also look fake, and as an audience it is almost impossible not to spot where the illusion breaks. You're just constantly looking for the flaws, whether you want to or not. Second, the movie fails to surpass or equal the animated movie. There are constant nods to the original, which just makes you wish you were watching that movie instead. They do some things different, but if you've seen the original animated Disney movie that this is based on, then you are constantly wondering ""will they do this"", and ""will they do that"". It's great to see Baloo sing Bear Necessities, but it's only done partially, and leaves you wanting for the full song. And then there are other songs that you really look forward to (Like Ka's song), but are left out, or only played during the end credits. The recent Beauty and the Beast live action movie was a literal copy of the animated movie, but at least it knew what it wanted to be. Jungle Book doesn't seem to know if it wants to be an homage to the animated film, or BE the animated film. And so it fails at both. The ending also feels a bit sudden. It seems as if the movie should have ended with Mowgli returning to the village, but it just ends abruptly. It doesn't feel entirely satisfying. It also feels like a lot of scenes may have perished on the cutting room floor for this film. This is not a terrible film, but ultimately it's a bit forgettable. It just makes you want to watch the original."
" Mildy entertaining, but nowhere as good as the 1967 version
",-0.2867,0.9852,2017-03-19 00:00:00,5,"Mowgli is a young boy raised by wolves in the jungle. He gets along with the other animals, but for one. Shere Khan, a tiger and king of the jungle, is angered at Mowgli's presence, as he knows Mowgli will one day grow up and adult humans are a threat. Mowgli leaves the pack and makes for the nearest human settlement, but this isn't enough for Shere Khan, who is determined to see him dead.Based on the Rudyard Kipling novel and with roughly the same central plot as the famous 1967 version, this is not in the same league as that version. While the 1967 one had a wonderfully innocent, feel- good vibrancy to it, aided by some great, stick-in-your-head songs, this version is much darker and far less energetic. While this is not necessarily a bad thing it just doesn't work as well for the story. The songs are what carried the 1967 version along and made it so memorable, and, but for two tunes, the 2016 version is music- less. Having decided to make a dark drama, director Jon Favreau then tries to introduce comedy/lightheartedness, in the form of Baloo, and this jars with the remainder of the movie, feels forced and largely falls flat. On the plus side, the CGI is great (though that is a given for a 2016 movie). Overall, mildly entertaining. Do yourself a favour: watch the 1967 version instead. (Never thought I'd find myself preferring a musical version of a movie to a largely-non-musical version, but there it is)."
" a great film
",0.6249,0.9918,2017-03-16 00:00:00,8,I loved the animated one and I knew that I would love the live action. The little boy is so great and he has such heart and energy and adventure in him. The chemistry between him and the other characters were so great as well. The CGI is so amazing and beautiful in this film and you feel like you are really in the jungle. I will always love this movie and it will be a classic in my heart.
" My opinion of Jungle Book
",0.0,0.9781,2017-03-05 00:00:00,8,"Last year, I went to the Disney's 2016 adaption of Rudyard Kipling's work The Jungle Book with a small group of friends. The new Jungle Book movie was pretty good. In my personal review of the film, it was much better then the old 1967 film version of Kipling's work. The chemistry between the wolf pack and Mowgli was much more satisfactory. Mowgli's adopted parent's were given a much better role in the film. The villains were much more terrifying (in a good way). I just wish that they could permanently do away with the musical numbers (it was not a musical, save for a brief reprisal of ""I wanna be like you"" by Christopher Walken's King Louie). Scarlett Johannson's Kaa was disappointingly put in a memorable one scene, when she was hinted to be a major character in the promotional material. Another thing I wish for is that there was more connections between the antagonists. In the film, Kaa and King Louie were one-scene secondary antagonists, with Idris Elba's Shere Khan being the primary antagonist in the full film. Both Kaa and King Louie seemed to be aware of Shere Khan's existence, but none of them seemed to have a connection. The physical confrontations between Shere Khan and Mowgli's companions were a satisfying and entertaining scene to watch. The Special Effects were amazing. In the film, only Neel Sethi was not computer animated. Everything else, including the locations were all computer animated. All in all, it was a pretty good film"
" Well made, but left me cold
",0.1406,0.9531,2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"This was certainly an amazing looking film, and knowing it was all computer generated is almost worrisome--computers are capable of so much now, practical effects are becoming endangered. The story was very familiar to me going in. It was one of the most beloved films of my childhood, and the original Disney film still looks amazing today. I don't know why, but nothing about this version interested me. Some of the differences are easy to pick out--there is no comparison between the original Baloo and the Bill Murray performance for me, as I much prefer the original. Most of the rest of the movie, I just didn't care about. King Louie, Shere Khan, even Mowgli--they just feel empty and uninspired. I didn't dislike it, I just didn't feel that I would ever want to watch it again."
" Definitely a good family movie
",0.6808,0.9862,2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"This is without a doubt a very good family movie. Many people seem to compare it unfavorably with the ""original"" animated movie from Walt Disney. To me these are quite different movies and should not really be compared. I have not read the book but I have a feeling that this movie follows the book more closely. It is a wee bit darker, more serious and incredibly beautiful to watch.I quite liked the original jungle book movie. It was one of my favorites when I was a kid. I am therefore quite happy that this was not just a ""dumb"" remake with modern CGI and that I quite liked this take of the classic story. This movie is, as I wrote, much more serious and a wee bit darker. It is less of a children's movie than the original.The wolves are getting much more time in this movie which is good. Mowgli's opponents are also much less comical and much more sinister. Kaa is a beastly snake with no remorse, King Louie is a huge, scheming, and tyrannical ape King and finally Shere Khan is a ruthless, human hating, tiger that kills anyone or anything that stands in his way.The CGI is top notch as far as I am concerned. The jungle scenery is absolutely stunning and it is really worth watching the movie just for the scenery. Combined with a classic adventure story that is not half bad makes for a really a good movie. I was definitely positively surprised by this movie. For me it is a big success."
" A visually pleasing movie, but unfortunately very predictable
",-0.2263,0.9919,2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"I didn't go into ""The Jungle Book"" with a lot of expectations and somehow I wasn't that impressed either. Without a doubt, its a visual masterpiece and everything looks amazing in the movie, which is great. What i'm disappointed with about this movie is that I didn't feel it brought anything new and exciting to the table story-wise. It was somehow all very predictable and I feel watching this movie as an adult leaves me wanting more story.I didn't like the performance from Neel Sethi and found most of his acting very bland. I know he's a child actor, but somehow most of his scenes(especially the dramatic ones) felt very cringe-worthy, which didn't help the movie either.Ultimately the thing that saved this movie for me and actually made me give it 7/10 was the voice acting. Ben Kingsley, Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Murray, Christopher Walken and especially Idris Elba nailed the voices of their respective characters and gave the movie renewed energy. When I think about this movie in a larger perspective it's rather disappointing. I think to myself: ""Would this movie even be somewhat good without the famous voice actors?"" and I come to the conclusion that it wouldn't. It's sad that big budget movies now rely on voice actors to save their movies compared to having a good story but its the reality we live in.In conclusion I was actually pretty disappointed by this movie in story terms. However, the voice acting of some very talented actors saved this movie for me and has made me want to recommend ""The Jungle Book"" to other movie lovers even if I feel like it's a pretty forgettable movie."
" Visually stunning and adorable, The Jungle Book was extremely entertaining.
",0.8399,0.8963,2017-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Visually stunning and adorable, The Jungle Book was extremely entertaining. The young child actor playing Mowgli excelled in portraying believable relationships with CGI animals. His friendship with Bill Murray's Baloo was refreshing and comical, and the obligatory ""Bare Necessities"" singing was incorporated brilliantly and effortlessly. This was in stark contrast to the other bout of singing in the movie that was forced and unnecessary. The movie excelled when depicting friendship and family but fell flat when trying to produce epic scenes of life and death.

" In my opinion, the most overrated movie of 2016
",0.0,0.9954,2017-02-14 00:00:00,5,"Overall: This movie is the most overrated movie of 2016 for me. It had some highs but many more lows for me. I don't think it deserves the praise it receives.Good: 1. I won't deny that the CGI in this movie is some of the greatest I've ever seen and 100% deserves the Oscar. It is practically flawless and would receive an 11/10 if I judged movies solely on that. Alas, I do not.2. The voice actors did great jobs even if I think there were some bad calls of judgement for who voiced who.3. I respect Neel Sethi for doing what he did under the conditions he was in. Despite this, I couldn't buy his acting but he does deserve respect for it.4. Bill Murray and Christopher Walken and Ben Kingsley were perfectly casted.Bad:1. As stated before, I couldn't buy the kids acting.2. I believe that both Idris Elba and Scarlett Johanson, while giving a reasonable performance, were not fit for the role they were in and much prefer the original cast for both them roles. 3. The story was quite weak for me. I don't care if it's identical to the book, I really didn't like the way it was presented and written.4. The songs in the movie were stupid. Nostalgic? Yes! Brilliant for animated film? 100%! Fit for realistic looking animals? No. It doesn't look or feel right to see a jolly bear or a huge monkey sing.5. The film is much darker and less happy than the original. I'm all up for a gritter, more mature reboot but this was so devoid of life and joy that the slight attempts at humour just fell flat and felt wrong. I much prefer the happier tone of the original Jungle Book.6. There are quite a few annoyances, such as how they clear up the fire, that I thought were annoying and lazy.5/10"
" Visually stunning and expertly acted
",0.3818,0.9937,2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"The film is great but the CGI is even greater. Neel Sethi's Mowgli may be the only living, breathing entity in this live action-CGI stew but you would consider Bagheera, Baloo, Shere Khan and party equally real by the time the show's over.Favreau and his team of tech wizards don't just give you CGI for the heck of it, they make it an integral part of the storytelling. The film is an eye-popping spectacle where the jungle breathes and animals emote with their eyes. The wizardry is overwhelmingly successful in the portrayal of the animals. They are so real – from the way they talk to their loping, sinuous walk to even their eyes – that you eventually forget that some graphic artist just made them up.The voice work is excellent all around. We hear Shere Khan before we see him and Elba brings an air of menace to the film. Khan is enjoying his cruelty and the actor shows it. Villain of the year, anyone? Ben Kingsley's Bagheera, also the narrator, is a statesman- like figure, Mowgli's father figure and the voice of sense. But the real winner is Murray's Baloo. A slacker who is not above a bit of lying if it can get the job done, Baloo is the story's comic relief. His relationship with Mowgli gives the film its heart and Favreau lets it breathe. The fact that he gets the film's best dialogues also helps.The duo also gets to sing the classic Bare Necessities together and that itself justifies the price of the ticket. The shaggy ambling sloth bear is a perfect fit for Murray and Murray's lazy dialogue- delivery is a perfect fit for Baloo. All in all, a casting choice made in heaven.So, how does it measure up to The Jungle Book versions we have seen till now – the Disney film made almost 50 years ago and the classic anime show on Doordarshan in the 90's? It matches up. The tone may be different and it may be edgier, but at heart The Jungle Book is still an adventure and a coming-of-age tale. Favreau gives us that sense of wonder, something we so desperately desire in these days of one franchise too many. The fact that he manages to do it in a story we all know so well is remarkable."
" A Movie is Made by Story, not Pictures, and this one Fails
",-0.4215,-0.9627,2017-02-01 00:00:00,3,"The scenery of this movie was very beautiful, as were all the animated characters, but the kid acting as the main actor was terrible and I am shocked at how they could choose someone like that. His monotonous expression and flat voice that conveyed no emotion ruined the movie, as did the meaningless plot. In one and a half hours, this movie was just random and meaningless, with important characters undeveloped. What's the point of remaking an old movie and not adding to it or at least making it fun to watch? The dialogues were extremely lame, especially the bear's. The names of all the animals and places were pronounced ridiculously, some in such a rubbish way, I'm surprised they couldn't consult an actual Indian to at least learn how to pronounce the words. I'm not sure how this movie became so famous, because it's so boring and unexciting. The snake appears for a few seconds and that's all. The monkey also appears briefly. No one is developed, not even Mowgli, and the bear does nothing to seem like he really loves him or anything. He's just selfish. What a rubbishly made thing.*3/10*"
" This Jungle Book has nothing between its covers
",0.0,0.9836,2017-01-31 00:00:00,5,"Jon Favreau's Jungle Book exists in a world that is somewhere between the animated feature film and the 1994, historically grounded, live action film.The result is a beautifully bland movie. This is not a warm, well told story, with interwoven charm and wisdom, it's an kid friendly action/adventure in the jungle with lots of animated effects.I kinda knew it when I saw the trailers, but there is a strong vibe that the Jungle Book would much rather be an experience, than a movie. This means trimming all the juice out of the writing and characters until you are left with that common feeling of being in a video game.There are far too many special effects, and they are distracting. Even though there is nothing technically wrong with the CGI, the movie makes some bad choices which destroys the illusion of having animals as real as say the Tiger in Life of Pi. Like their animated counter parts, the cast of this Jungle Book have animated lips, making them un-compatible with the very real world they live in. There are also too many stagy sequences featuring unrealistic numbers of animals, which in the 21st century wouldn't even convince an eight year old that CGI wasn't needed.The film makes another very poor decision to include two of the original musical numbers but minus the one element that would make them worth while; the actors can't sing. This brings me to the subject of voice casting. The voice work across the board is surprisingly refined, and uncharacteristic. Bill Murray as Baloo is everything that Baloo should not be; dull, laid back, uninterested. Scarlett Johansson is not remotely charismatic enough for the intoxicating Kaa the snake that she inhabits, and Christopher Walken as King Louis produces a near caricature of a mafia head.And then there is Mowgli. The decision to match his age to his animated counterpart was a mistake. One of the themes of The Jungle Book is boy to manhood. The climax of the film is also heavily depended on Mowgli needing to be commanding and fierce enough to rally the jungle against Shere Kahn. This ten year old boy who looks like he's reading off a teleprompter half the time, is not that Mowgli. I kept hoping for a few good laughs in the picture, but I just saw occasional attempts that fell flat. The strongest aspect is that when it is not crammed with CGI animals The Jungle Book is quite beautiful to behold. The problem is that like its protagonist, the camera is always on the move, giving us no time to stop and smell the flowers. Unlike in a Miyazaki movie, which will take its time to get you lost in the wilderness, The Jungle is strictly 'cut-to-story'.If only there was a story to cut to. With its superficial, effects-driven action sequences The Jungle might entertain some children with ADD, but for the rest of us, the film is little more than an elongated version of its trailer."
" Terrible Remake of a Great Classic

The fact that there's now a real boy and ""real"" animals is unnecessary! I didn't even finish the whole thing and I was disappointed that they ruined such a great original movie! It's upsetting! Cause I watched The Jungle Book from 1967 a lot when I was younger! I wasn't around when the original came out, not until 31 years later. But it's just so upsetting to see such a great movie ruined by unnecessary CGI technology and the plot being switched around! And the fact that the person who voices Kaa isn't even a guy like the original just really aggravates me! So many wrong things about this movie! What a let down! And I don't think I'll finish watching it or watch it again!"
" A Visual Delight.....
",0.0,0.9481,2017-01-11 00:00:00,5,"""The Jungle Book"" was one of my favorite TV series that aired in the Doordarshan in the early '90s. The story has been retold through several movies and this latest blockbuster also does the same. It tells the story of Mowgli, a young boy, grown by a pack of wolves in an Indian Jungle. Disney Pictures this time takes into the CGI over the conventional 2D animation and creates a stunningly superb visual feast. It's certainly something very different you've ever seen. The jungles, animals are all a part of a CGI animation and with the superb techniques you're taken to an hour long drive to the forests in which everything looks for real. Instead of the distant shots, the film uses close shots for which the film looks visually pleasing. No doubt, technically the film is somewhat a testimony of something you've ever encountered in movies.The acting of the boy as Mowgli and his screen presence looks astounding and the voices given to the animals get quite well. But the grave problem in the film is the lack of the wittiness and charm in its narrative. For one third of the film, there seems a bit of charm and laughter which soon disappears and falls into the computer glitches. Somewhere the innocence, wit, and surprises get lost for which the film though being technically superb starts to lose your attention by the second half.Rating: 1.5 stars out of 4"
" Not even close to the Disney animated version
",0.0,0.9851,2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Well, technically it's good, the animals are convincing enough, but... apart from that, it's nowhere near the quality of the Disney animation, not surprisingly, since that is one of the best animated features ever made. It's funny, exciting, and have GREAT songs! This has neither. Well, maybe some excitement, but not enough. It seems like Favreau is unable to create tension here, things just trots along. When Akeela meets Shere Khan for the last time, well, it was like, so what. No grief, no dwelling about what happened. It just did - move along! There's very little comedy, but a couple of times there was a funny bit. All in all, technically very well done, but you're better off watching the original again for entertainment. That one never grows stale, this one already is."
" A remake of the animated classic for the new generation - a technical marvel
",0.4215,0.9985,2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Jon Favreau's 2016 remake of the 1967 animated classic of the same name is not only full of heart and excellent adventure but it also boasts arguably the most impressive CGI ever put on screen. Entire landscapes and rainforests are created digitally along with the sparse animal life inhabiting these settings. The film is bursting with life as we witness the seamless interactions between the CGI and our single human actor. It is immensely impressive and baffling to think that this entire world was created from thousands of hours of meticulous and detailed work, but the awe doesn't just stop there as Jungle Book manages to be incredibly entertaining fun as well as an unquestionable technical feat. Jungle Book features excellent voice acting from a cast of talented actors and actresses such as Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson and a singing Christopher Walken as the towering King Louie. The film only features one human actor, played by the young Neel Sethi. At only 10 years of age, Sethi had to interact with animals that weren't even there, which can prove to be difficult as some of his acting was questionable. It's hard to fault Sethi for this, as interaction with CGI is difficult without proper direction, and sometimes the scenes of Sethi's shared screen- time with the CGI creations aren't directed too well. Moments like this are infrequent, but it is noticeable when Sethi is clearly not looking wherever his character should be. Jungle Book tells a story that somewhat follows that of the original, but features different developments while also excluding some. The story has been criticized for it's lack of substance but I never found that to be an issue. Characters had simple motivations and the story is well told, making it easy for anyone to follow while only rarely feeling dumbed-down for children. Jungle Book ranks among my favorite films of the year simply because of it's simplicity and just how enjoyable it is. There are scenes of thrilling adventure, heartwarming character interactions and a constant ability to charm and entertain the viewer. There are times where the child actor's performance is questionable and the story eventually begins to run thin, but Jungle Book still managed to be an exceptionally engaging and fun Disney film. It captures the magic of the original and gives the new generation their version, this time with phenomenal use of CGI and excellent voice acting. Whether or not you enjoyed this film, it should be credited that Jungle Book created an entire world in a studio, which should be more than enough to at least earn your respect."
" An enjoyable take on the classic story
",0.4404,0.9882,2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Disney continues with their string of remakes from their older animated films with this new adaptation of The Jungle Book. Directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man), I found this a rather enjoyable family film with terrific CGI that brought the jungle and the animals to life in the best possible way. The story, of course, follows a young man cub named Mowgli as he is forced to head to the man village to escape from the dangerous tiger Shere Kahn. And from there on begins the adventure with peril, but also excitement along the way. As far as the on screen talent goes, Neel Sethi delivers a very serviceable performance as Mowgli with Bill Murray and Ben Kingsley being standouts in the voice-over for Baloo And Bagheera respectively. Idris Elba also excelled as Shere Khan, a role very much suited for his voice type. In the end, this version of The Jungle Book impresses visually and is quite charming, as well as dark with it's story making for a worthwhile movie."
