" Just no!
",-0.3595,-0.7959,2021-02-21 00:00:00,1,"No, no, no. No! Just no.They are saying my review is too short so I will add the following nos."
" Better than the reviews suggest
",0.4404,-0.9698,2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Watching this movie back as one of the final films Robin Williams completed is absolutely tragic, and you have to wonder considering the context of the film and the failed suicide attempt later was this a cry for help in real life?Okay so the movie plots weren't fantastic in areas, it seems to dart between scenes with very little context between them. Peter dinklage whilst solid was completely wasted in this film and mila kunis was particularly underwhelming to say the least. The main plot you need to understand with this film though is a simple one. What would you do with 90 mins left to live? Its of course a moral dilemma of sorting any loose ends before your passing, making sure those that you may have wronged in the past you right those wrongs. Its easy enough for anyone to at least attempt to conceptualise this and Robin Williams does a fantastic job of portraying this particular character.It's not the best movie quality wise, the greenscreen on the bridge scene is laughably bad for a film so recent however I'm prepared to give it a pass just for how well Robin Williams portrays the character in this film."
" Try not to take the negative reviews to the heart
",-0.5719,0.4118,2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,"I definitely liked this movie.Robin Williams going from event to event and coming to the terms of his condition. The events were always funny and the side plot of his family/ doctor trying to find him were paced fine.The language was a bit much at times to the point of extremeness. The acting was fine but that one scene with Louis C.K. and Mila Kunis hit me like a truck. The reasons for Robin Williams travelling from plot point to plot point seemed iffy at times as well.Overall, Robin Williams raging is refreshing."
" Terrible movie

" Underrated
",0.0,0.8047,2020-09-13 00:00:00,7,"The story is a simple one, which can make people look at themselves.
The acting was great for the most part, however there were points where it feels the comedy is being forced and feels a little off the mark. Don't let that put you off this emotional, funny and simplistic story"
" Unrealistic
",0.0,-0.3716,2020-03-13 00:00:00,5,"There are some traditional conflicts in this movie, son and dad, brothers, and doctors and patients. But this move is sooo dramatic.... Nice story but I didn't quite get the purpose of being angry."
" ""When I say, 'stay calm', I...mean...calm!""
",0.0,0.62,2020-03-11 00:00:00,6,"I'm going to wind up saying the same thing about Robin Williams here as I did when I reviewed the film ""Boulevard"", which also came out in 2014, the same year he died. Based on his role in both films, one has to wonder what his tortured mind must have been going through by the time he ended his life. Because here, Henry Altmann (Williams) is full of rage since the death of his son Peter two years prior. His marriage is just about bust, and his other son Tommy (Hamish Linklater) pursued his own career path as a dance instructor instead of joining the Altmann law practice. Even the friends he expected to show up for his 'going away' party never came around, and the only one who did (Richard Kind), made it all about himself over Henry's stealing a high school girl friend, which he didn't even remember. Now you might wonder if people really hold grudges over that sort of thing for five decades or so, but I experienced the same behavior by fellow classmates at a fiftieth reunion a couple years ago, and I can attest that at least that particular scene shouldn't be dismissed as improbable.Now to say the premise of this story goes beyond a stretch is probably the most favorable thing I can say about it. In a frustrated moment of blind rage herself, Dr. Sharon Gill (Mila Kunis) blurts out that Henry has only ninety minutes to live due to a brain aneurysm that's about to burst. How anyone could accept a diagnosis like that is beyond my comprehension, but for the purpose of the picture you have to go with it. Attempting to reconcile the dysfunctional life he's had with his family for the past two years, Henry goes on a whirlwind mission to patch things up with his wife (Melissa Leo) and son Tommy. Had this been a straight comedy, some of the situations that occur in the film would have worked a lot better, like the revenge seeking taxi cab driver. As it is, you have to groan your way through some of the more inane scenes.Regarding ""Boulevard"", one of the things that worked in it's favor was the absence of a virtually obligatory sex scene in a modern movie, but here, director Phil Alden Robinson opted to go with that flashback of Dr. Gill recalling a tryst with a senior doctor in one of the hospital rooms where they worked. For me, it brought down the tone of the movie and caused me to wonder why Mila Kunis would ever have agreed to film such a scene. It made her look trashy, and considering the fact that she was a resident doctor, it demonstrated a total lack of propriety and professionalism, not to mention a low opinion of herself."
" Misguided, depressing downer of a movie
",-0.3818,-0.4312,2019-10-27 00:00:00,1,"Toward the end of his life, his star having significantly dimmed, Robin Williams made a lot of curious independent features that served to pay the bills and keep him in the public eye.Some, such as the almost impossibly dark black comedy ""World's Greatest Dad,"" were bold, if nonetheless desperate choices. Others, like ""The Big White"" and the film adaptation of Armistead Maupin's novel ""The Night Listener,"" were minor, meandering curiosities.But there's nothing even remotely positive to say about ""The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,"" which provided Williams his final starring film role.Its Debby-Downer of a plot centers on a once happy-go-lucky man descended into seething rage and self-loathing after one of his two sons dies tragically.Diagnosed with an inoperable brain aneurysm and lied to by a frustrated doctor that he has only 90 minutes to live, he decides to make every minute count by repairing his estranged relationships with his wife and remaining son.You will like or sympathize with no one in this film, especially Williams, who tragically appears to be struggling just to get through it, and most especially overrated actress Mila Kunis as the terrible, terrible doctor who gives the Williams character his fake diagnosis out of sheer selfishness and conceit, and whose quest to find him and make it right is rooted in those two characteristics alone. The film wants you to root for her. You will root for the revoking of her license to practice medicine, and perhaps jail time.This all builds to a schmaltzy climax on the Brooklyn Bridge, for no good reason, and the awfully unconvincing green-screen composite shot has to be seen to be believed.The great Peter Dinklage, as the Williams character's brother, is brilliant as usual, but utterly wasted. Seriously, you'll wish for a sequel or TV series featuring his devout Jewish little person lawyer.He's the only good thing about this movie, which is otherwise about as entertaining as reading the obituary of an old high school chum."
" chilling to watch
",-0.0258,0.6597,2019-03-26 00:00:00,5,This film was one of robins last film and had some similarities to his real life battling with illness. This was a more serous role for him but not one of his best.
" After watching, I'm angier
",0.0,-0.9579,2019-02-18 00:00:00,4,"What if Neil Simon were to write a story about a really ticked off guy but forgot to add any humor. This might be the answer. Stilted dialogue that doesn't resemble real life--made more for broad-gesturing stage actors, characters that kind of represent real people, but not really and a story to match. It's a shame because there are a lot of good actors here. Some like James Earl Jones and Mellissa Leo are just wasted in this. Robin Williams plays the angry man of the title and remains so throughout the film with a touch of remorse near the end, but by that point, you want him to die. Kunis is almost an emotional doppleganger of William's character, annoying but not quite to William's depth. I actually prefer Robin Williams as a serious actor more than his comedic roles but in this, he was just an unrelenting a-hole. We're supposed to feel sorry for the guy because of a past tragedy but, most people, even with a burden such as his, would be able to find a little humanity in others. The very end of the film is cringe-worthy. Some may like this film, mistaking it for powerful drama rather than contrived sausage."
" An Edgy Final Tribute to Robin Williams
",0.0,-0.4536,2019-01-15 00:00:00,8,"17 March 2015. It's really hard to distinguish Robin William's character from is own real life persona in this movie. It will be interesting to see how this movie is experienced in the future when the immediacy of William's own real suicide has faded in memory for audience members. One fascinating question will be how Peter Dinklage's character as a ""small person"" is experienced. Was it William's suicide that distracted focus on Dinklage's ""small person"" presence in the movie that allow this ""small person"" to be cast and scripted and acted without any ""smallness"" attributed to him? His character and how others behaved around him, presented one of the few, if only, movie where size was absolutely not even noticed.Robin William's character was edgy and raw, Robins wasn't a singularly bad or nice character, yet his personal legacy of the end of his life and his redemptive spirit seem to echo throughout the movie. The movie is necessarily a drama with humor incorporated into it and William's humor as a person continues to color it. This is a message movie, a morality tale, an emotional thriller running against time. Unlike Michael Douglas's character who beings to fall apart in Falling Down (1993) or Christian Slater's pent up psychotic experience in He Was a Quiet Man (2007), Robin portrays an angry man with a terminal illness who will die in a short time. As such, such life transforming experiences vary, but in this movie, there is a lasting tribute and morality tone that is apt for being one of Robin's last movies."
" Williams Great, Movie Okay
",0.7184,-0.9849,2018-12-12 00:00:00,7,"The movie is just okay, kind of slow and not any great performances other than Williams, but he is great as a man with severe anger issues who is told by a doctor he has 90 minutes left to live and decides to tell everyone what he needs to before that happens. Meanwhile the doctor tries to track him down to tell him the truth. It's not hilarious but has some great dark comedy, and Williams does a great job as an angry man with a heart and a lot of pain deep down."
" CARE DOES NOT EQUAL NEED
",0.4939,-0.9377,2018-10-16 00:00:00,6,"Henry (Robin Williams) is having a bad day. He is told by pill popping Sharon (Mila Kunis) his substitute doctor, he has 90 minutes to live. This forces Henry to run around Brooklyn attempting to connect and make amends for the past. Meanwhile Sharon is attempting to locate him as she sees he own career going down the tubes as well.The film opens with both Henry and Sharon talking about themselves in third person narration and then again at the end. The production attempts to combine quirky humor with a heart warming tale, but falls short. Robin Williams, who was supposed to play an angry unlikeable character, unfortunately comes across as an angry unlikeable character, who has no one to blame but himself. Both Henry and Sharon are forced to examine their lives, hence the heart warming part as the sound track attempts to make us feel good about them.Should do as a rental after the Magnolia films options.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, rear hospital gown nudity (Robin Williams)"
" Funny, Relatable and Moving.
",0.4404,0.9645,2018-08-24 00:00:00,8,"I stumbled across this film whilst browsing through Prime having never even heard about it!This film was very enjoyable. I loved it. If you like depth to your comedy there is nothing cheesy here. The acting is excellent and Robin Williams's comic timing was on point!If you fancy something different, moving yet very funny then this one delivers in spades!"
" Very Good!
",0.54,0.8555,2018-08-17 00:00:00,9,"Although the plot is a little un-realistic, it is still funny. I am surprised it is getting below 6 ratings, as of now. Hopefully, it will go up.Robin Williams is funny as usual."
" Unsatisfying
",0.0,-0.6911,2018-04-22 00:00:00,5,"Unsatisfying. I hope this was not Robin Williams' final movie. Poignant because it concerns the death of the character he plays. For this reason only was I able to watch it to the end. Not a good reason to view a film. But I wanted it to improve, even after the embarrassingly insensitive stuttering scene with James Earl Jones."
" An okay movie, not a boring watch
",0.4333,0.8274,2017-12-09 00:00:00,6,"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, directed by Phil Alden Robinson, has a story that revolves around the emotional journey of Henry Altmann (Robin Williams) after he found out he has 90 minutes to live and the emotional journey of Dr. Sharon Gill (Mila Kunis), after she delivered the bad news. My opinion, this is an average movie.With 83 minutes (1 hour and 23 minutes) of movie I wasn't allowed to have a deep familiarization with all the characters, although there are some moments where I could feel the pain and/or frustration Henry Altmann and Dr. Sharon Gill felt, since they are the most focused and developed characters.The title alludes to Henry Altmann being an extremely angry person. I personally didn't feel it that much throughout the movie. He has some outbursts during his journey, and some characters mention his deep anger issues, but it made me a little distant towards his angry persona.I noticed some inconsistencies during the pace of the movie, when sometimes I felt the actions were rushed (which was a good thing since he had 90 minutes to live), and other times it looked like the place had slow down to the point that it looked like more than his 90 minutes had passed.There are some funny moments, not enough to be considered a comedy, and, although a little bit of a clichÃ©, you can feel the drama surrounding the past and present of the characters.I could see that they tried to juggle the rush of the characters and the details of their actions. Could've used a bit more work towards a better combination of both, but overall it's a 6 out of 10."
" like a TV movie from the 1970's
",0.3612,-0.5606,2017-04-19 00:00:00,4,Robin Williams in the park and then Robin Williams as an angry man 25 years later looking exactly the same. A dud of an opening which than continues with mild THAT GIRL situations that are so unfunny and Hallmark TV movies of an earlier era that it is embarrassing that Robin Williams who had been involved with some excellent movies would be in a movie as weakly written with a director who is given over to showing us the most mild well used TV movie situations.
