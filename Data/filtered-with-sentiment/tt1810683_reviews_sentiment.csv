" A challange to become a better human being.
",0.4404,0.3506,2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,"Little Boy 2015Setting: WW2, American men wanting to contribute by going off to fight the war, and people being left behind.
There are several stories, and several themes interwoven.There is a story of a little boy who hopes to find a way to get his dad to come back by making a deal with God, as explained by a quirk of luck by a father Oliver.
Father Oliver gives Pepper a to do list, to help him ""grow his faith"".
The boy accepts the challenge, and is willing to do whatever.
The challenge is one every one of us grown ups can take on as a serious request: Fight the inner battle to become a better human, purify your heart by changing it.
All the cards are stacked against the little boy, discimination, bullying, we get shown a painfully good look at the sorry state of affairs of the heart of our fellow men.
The movie accepts this challenge at the comfortable Hollywood level, and fails to pick up the challenge at the level Christ took it, but that is for us to do.The gauntlet has been thrown down, challenging u to pick it up, and shaming us and showing us exactly why we need to."
" Faith of a child in action
",0.4215,0.9618,2020-04-15 00:00:00,9,An excellent depiction of faith hope and loving your enemy in a funny entertaining brilliantly acted movie.
" Some movies make my eyes water...
",0.0,0.8882,2020-01-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie makes me completely cry. A number of times, actually. Pepper is a brilliant young performer. I am a darkly cynical person. I often find myself enjoying movies where the bad guys win. At the very least stand out. This movie is purely uplifting and goes to show you that heroes come in all shapes. All sizes. This movie is a masterpiece."
" Review of cursory reviews
",0.0,0.5106,2019-12-17 00:00:00,4,"Most the individuals who liked the film made connotations to god, while some stated that it was christian fairyland propaganda and infantile. While it ostensibly was, this is the first old fashioned childish feel good film that I have seen that imparts a few socratic lines to prod some of the audience to question beliefs, miracles, etc.; unfortunately it seems as though that may have gone over the intended audience's heads due to their insular societal inculcated dogma - next time, try a 2 x 4. Obviously, different people - including family members - could/did watch it and come away with different thoughts about the movie as well the thoughts of those who watched it."
" Moving story
",0.0,-0.296,2019-12-17 00:00:00,7,"Well dramatized story of racial prejudice, belief in something grater and the magic of belief. Exceptional acting by Jakob Salvatti."
" Wonderful
",0.5719,0.4404,2019-07-09 00:00:00,10,"A lot of folks have missed the point. This movie is from a child's point of view. As such, it's superb. Children don't think the way adults do. Once you watch it from little boy's point of view u'll understand why I had to rate this movie as a 10."
" An endearing message.
",0.0,0.743,2019-05-26 00:00:00,9,"Definitely a wholesome film that knows just how to pull at your heartstrings. And while the main thrust of the plot may seem a little cliche, its message is endearing and definitely worth the watch."
" Anti-American Propaganda
",-0.25,-0.8744,2019-03-09 00:00:00,1,"I watched this hoping it would be a warm, nostalgic depiction of 1940s America, only to find it was subtle Anti-American Propaganda, even Anti-Christian. Almost every American of European origin was depicted in a negative light, and Christianity depicted as having no answers, while the ""heroes"" were Third World immigrants, Japanese samurai and magicians pushing the occult message to children that they have ""special magical powers"", and don't need God. The other message to children is that it is OK to go into a strange man's home with him alone, and to cheat in a fight, by whacking your opponent with a metal lunchbox in the face, or shooting them with a poisoned dart. I hope people will wake up to the subversive propaganda often presented in movies."
" Pick one plot and stick with it!
",0.0,0.3612,2019-02-18 00:00:00,2,This movie made me feel like an A-hole for being an American.
" faith of the little boy
",0.4215,0.9702,2019-01-22 00:00:00,8,"The little boy impressed me with the strength of my truth. I admired him so much, that innocence carries a lot of true faith, OH little boy, a wonderful movie holds many meanings and is also unexpected"
" don't belittle the little boy
",0.3412,0.0772,2019-01-21 00:00:00,8,"This movie killed two birds with one stone, it tackled racism against japanese during the second world war period, also it focused on matter of the metaphysical power of a might faith, most of the ending scenes were sentimental sobbing material in which render the movie to become melodramatic and fanciful , i enjoued it although i thought it was going to be tiresome but luckily it wasn't tacky ."
" beautifully heart-wrenching
",0.5719,0.9808,2018-11-09 00:00:00,10,"So we were at school, and the entire 7th grade had to watch this film. After the film was finished, most of the people watching were crying a bit. This movie was beautiful, heart-wrenching, funny, and empowering. We never expected the film to be THAT nice but it turned out that it did. I loved its message about faith and though it may have been shown in a bit of a Christian way, it still speaks to people of all religions about faith and never giving up. I love how the little boy is able to stand up for himself despite being little. I also loved the setting of the film, which was in the sunny, seaside town of O'hare, California. I also loved its vintage feel. 100% recommended."
" About what you'd expect from Christian cinema...
",0.0,-0.7269,2018-08-11 00:00:00,1,"Little Boy has all the hallmarks of a bad Christian film. Namely, racism, bigotry, intolerance, and in this case, the deaths of 200,000 Japanese civilians all brushed aside with the flimsy ""It's ok because it's FOR JESUS"" excuse. Oh, and Paul Blart is there for some reason too..."
" Great date night movie
",0.6249,0.8402,2018-07-08 00:00:00,9,I wasn't expecting much from this movie but damnnn did it surprise me. I could have watched an extra 30 minutes of what happened next. One of the highest ratings I ever game a movie. And the GF loved it.
" Unrealistic, and ignorant
",-0.2732,-0.9402,2018-05-08 00:00:00,1,"The entire film is a little boy trying to use telekinesis to bring his father home from war... yes seriously. 
 While the movie is one of those 'Christian' productions about faith, it's like the film equivalent of a watery chicken soup coated in buttercream frosting; it's supposed to be good for you, but it's cheaply made and coated in so much sweet stuff that it's hard to finish and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Also, it is completely unrealistic and misleading; God is not a genie in a bottle who grants wishes, and having faith doesn't get you everything you want. 
 
If all that doesn't bother you, watching a small child use racial slurs for an hour and a half probably will. As stated by other reviewers, not one adult (not even the priest trying to help the boy) tell him that referring to anyone as JAP isn't a very Christian thing to do. (never mind the disrespecting of his elders) Especially when said little boy is being bullied and called names himself throughout the entire film. (dwarf, midgit etc.). And if THAT doesn't set off your alarm bells then the fact that this film (and the title character) are NAMED after the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima should; 66,000 people were killed as a direct result of the Hiroshima blast, and 69,000 were injured to varying degrees. Of those deaths, ONLY 20,000 were members of the Imperial Japanese Army.
Not cute, not a wholesome or realistic story, and not worth the time."
" A good light hearted flick which Metacritic scored 30 for reasons they wouldn't know too!!
",0.5399,0.9616,2017-05-26 00:00:00,7,"I don't agree with the critics on this one at all. Little Boy is a good movie that combines different human feelings altogether in a movie. It is very good narration of love,compassion and hope. Little doesn't loses any hope rather always gets inspired about finding his father. Little Boy gets convinced on him moving the the mountain whereas earthquake happened coincidentally making it look like Little Boy did it for all those were watching the scene;Mrs.Busbee says she will always remain Mrs.James Busbee all her life to the doctor; Little boys brother realizing his mistake and saving Hashi Moto's life;Little boy completing the list to help bring his father by believing it. All these are lessons in the movie that provides you with relief on watching the movie!!"
